3,I was expecting more from this one.,"Since Alien is one of my all-time favorite Sci Fi movies, I really was excited to watch this one. I was so disappointed. It was slow and the story was just confusing."
3,"Eh, Okay","The movie was good, as were the graphics. The plot was definitely different than what the previews lead viewers to expect. I would not classify this as a horror movie or that much of a thriller, but it was interesting. If you're expecting something amazing based on the previews, you'll be sorely disappointed."
3,Prequel To Alien,This wasn't a bad movie but I expected a little more out of it!! I wish it would have given us a little preview in the ending leading up to ALIEN going into Sigournney Weaver's character. Nice clear movie and well packaged!!
2,It's really a horror movie,Horror movie set in space suits. Pretty disappointing. Luckily I saw it in Mexico where the ticket was on;y $2.50
1,One of the worst movies ever.,"This movie is more of the same stale generic sci-fi garbage we've been seeing for years. It brings nothing new to the table. It raises a million questions but answers none of them. It makes absolutely no sense at all & it's just a bunch of scenes put together that don't go anywhere. The creatures are really retarded looking & just appear with no rhyme or reason. And it has nothing to do with the Alien franchise. The only reason it's getting good reviews is because they stuck the Space Jockey from ALIEN in it to trick Alien fans into thinking it has something to do with Alien. So they're all giving it good reviews because they want the Alien franchise to continue & they feel some kind of strange loyalty to Ridley Scott. I've seen better direct to video releases. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage, just wait for the DVD or Netflix."
2,reely sux,a 12 year old could have produced a better film. how many times can we see aliens popping from stomachs???
3,I dont get it,"The writers must have written this one up in one sitting, cause I know they must have been tired when they got near the end. Remember in Alien, when they came across the big dead guy sitting in the controls chair, with his ribcage blown out, on the alien ship? Well, prometheus was doin ok with leading up to how that came to be, then the alien guy ends up back in a different part of ship at the end, and gets infected after leaving the control chair and the alien explodes out of him in another area of the ship. Like I said, the writers must have been wacked when they wrote end part, it was making sense, then ?????????? Oh, I get it, maybe we are supposed to believe that the Alien, after bursting out, carried the big guy back to the control chair and placed him there, yeah, of course, how did I not figure that out? That way it would be easier for Dallas and Kane, to find him easier when they came along in ""Alien"""
1,Unintentionally FUNNY it was so bad!,"This was a total flop of a film--exactly the opposite of the film:Aliens [Blu-ray]. Nobody worth caring about. Nothing scary at all. Nothing profound. Just shallow, silliness. Nothing exciting even. I won't go into the details as it does not merit my time."
1,Crap,Loved the first Alien movie. Thought the rest got progressively worse. This one was only slightly better than the final alien POS.
1,Very Poorly Done,"Expectations high, delivery low. Very poorly directed and produced movie. Plot is a joke. Acting even worse. What a disappoinment."
1,Promethius,"The movie started out slow and got worse.I thought the CGI was fair. The story line was predictable .I am a THERON fan ,but that part was not for her."
3,Yeah......no,"With out dredging up any Alien lore, this film is mere sci-fi pap. It is coarse with regards to the characters and relies on non Alien franchise ideas (black goo/ purity from x-files) inexplicable behavior by the engineers, stupid behavior from the crew etc. etc. Perhaps the behavior could best be explained an ancient Weyland-Yutani temporal accident gone full circle or maybe the engineer race are actually Genetic Rights Activists freeing all genetic material in the universe from the burden of supporting life. Who knows?"
2,Not very good...disappointed!,"I am NOT a fan of Sci-Fi, I only rented it because Noomi Rapace, the girl from the original Swedish ""Dragon Tattoo"" movies was in it.I thought she was great in the Tattoo series; she's pretty bad in this movie though.I fully understand that one must suspend any disbelief in order to enjoy a Sci-Fi movie, so my problem is in the terrible screenplayand the poor acting."
4,pro-metheus,"I am a big sci-fi fan anyway....books, movies and TV series. I bought Prometheus, unseen, as Ridley Scott was all I needed to know. Great look to the movie, and a story that moves along nicely. Set up for the next round. A prequel of sorts that may tie in to an older premise. I have the HD copy, but will play on a standard setting...a win win."
4,Must see for ALIEN fans,"If you're looking for a straight forward ALIEN prequel, be prepared to be disappointed. This is a good film, and though it does answer a few of those questions that ALIEN fans are looking for answers to, it raises just as many new ones. Still, if you're a Ridley Scott fan or, if like me, you're a diehard ALIEN fan, this is a must-see."
3,"Good action, but but ending too silly for the serious start","The movie starts out great, with spectacular scenery, and intriguing scene and then kicking in to the action. Pretty quickly we are following the starship Prometheus on its secret mission. The setup is a pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo, but still hints at a cerebral plot. Though the protagonist (Noomi Rapace) and her boyfriend look and act more like movie stars than scientists, the fact that they are supposed to depict scientists seems hopeful.Yet, the movie quickly degenerates into Rambo-like action. Wind hurls our heroes around and mysterious aliens attack them, and they jump and shoot and cut and run and fight. Tom and Jerry cartoons have deeper plots.It's a good movie if you like mindless action (sans car-chases and machine guns, sorry). The scenery and special effects are worth watching. Acting and dialog is mediocre to so-so, and the plot is from a vending-machine."
3,Worth watching just for the special effects,"The time is 2094 and we head into pre-Alien adventure land.The special effects in ""Prometheus"" made it worthwhile to watch this movie. Otherwise, it was a real yawner to me. Plot holes and mediocre acting by some otherwise fine actors (Charlize Theron, Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender). I was expecting a much better movie after seeing the promos but alas, all I got to see were some really stupid moves by the explorers of this planet, a really (excellent) cringe-worthy ""baby"" birth and very little connection to the original Alien franchise.It wasn't totally awful but it could have been so much better."
3,Visually Beautiful,"This movie has beautiful visuals and is somewhat entertaining. It tries very hard to be deep and contemplative though. You can see faint whisps of the Blade Runner-esque theme of questioning the definition of humanity. Also, it plays a bit with the ambiguity between creator and created. Unfortunately, the depth needed to make these themes meaningful never really materializes."
4,Great Sci-Fi but missing heart,"If atmosphere and believable science fiction worlds are your cup of tea, then watch this movie. It is a entertaining, fun and undeniably interesting. There are definitely issues with the human characters. They tend to feel flat and lifeless. Fassbender is amazing and the effects are just superb. If you go in not expecting a true alien sequel/prequel you will enjoy it. Cheers"
2,Found it boring,Don't waste your time here people. I fell asleep and was really looking forward to watching this so that's enough...
1,Prometheus,Was not able to see movie in its entirety because it kept stopping - and finally screen went blank (was not my equipment since everything else worked - just could not get Prometheus back....very frustrating and a waste of money!
4,Watchable.,"For all the critisism that this movie has gotten since release, and cries of disappoinment from the fans of the ""Alien"" franchise, this is a very riveting movie. I've watched it three times, and while I don't regard it as a classic, mainly because of the over simplistic and none too intelligent story line, I find scale of the visuals and sound, and the great perfomances of Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender make for a very interesting 124 minutes."
2,Such a letdown...,"This movie could have been awesome. What I feel like they did, however, was take a really cool idea and throw money at it until it sucked. The film made no sense. The plot was so disjointed and clumsy that I got lost several times. The script was awful as was the acting (except for David, David was neat). Also, and this shouldn't matter but it does, the leading actress is freaking hideous. From some angles she looks okay, from others she is a complete dumpster fire. The effects were good and the environment was beautiful, though, hence the 2 stars."
2,Visually stunning ... intellectually bleh,"Very poor story line. Incredulous responses to situations by ""elite ???"" scientific crew leaves you wondering ""why in the world did they do that?"" Like I said ""BLEH!"""
2,Totally Predictable,"Poorly written, and the alien thing at the end made it worse. A robot officer that goes out of his way to support an agenda, by his creator. Give me a break! I knew what was going to happen before it actually did. Sorry writing. Sorry that I wasted money to watch it. Though I didnt order it thru Amazon. Because it only streams in 2 channel audio. If were to have ordered it thru Amazon there would be even more bad reviews for it. Dont waste your time folks...."
1,What a stinker!,"What a terrible movie. If you feel the urge to see this film, borrow it from a friend or rent it - I think you'll be happy you didn't buy this one."
1,Lacked all originality,I had high expectations for this movie so I was very disappointed to find a rehash of the Alien legacy. The movie was well executed with good acting and good effects but yet it lacked any originality. Apparently it was assumed that only people living in a cave for the last 20 years would watch this movie. A lot of money and time could have been saved by just splicing old sci-fi movies together with no loss of entertainment value.
2,You can hate or love this movie... I hate it.,"The premise of having humans coming from another planet to populate the earth is not bad at all, it intrigued me how would a human conceptualize another human as its own creator, I mean, that is basically what the bible says, God created man in his own image. So if there was a human race that would be able to go to a planet and plant the seed for human procreation, so many questions emerge that a I get goosebumps if this idea had fallen in the hands of a good creative writer. So there I was waiting for creative breakthroughs, interesting dialog, good action sequences... but what I got was disappointment over disappointment, especially at the end. It reminded me the movie ""The Mist"" which takes you to a good level of entertainment, and at the very end they blow it. But that's just me."
2,Had potential,"I didn't go into this thinking about the Alien saga, and truly didn't expect much after reading the reviews, but this movie, that had potential, was extremely disappointing. It started out interesting, but quickly became incoherent. It almost like it was poorly cut. Special effects were not particularly interesting."
5,Prometheus.. A smart film that revives the series of Alien,"Prometheus.. A smart film that revives the series of Alien, Ridley Scott returns to their old tricks in this masterpiece, very well prepared and very well developed .. I'm waiting for DVD, BluRay 3D, Bluray and digital copy for my collection, I can't wait...."
1,Dumb da dumb dumb,"This movie is really really DUMB. 'I just signed up for the money dude.' 'I had no idea we were going on a 5+ year mission.' 'By the way, now that we are 2+ years into this gig, what kind of bene's do we get??' 'Hey, is that a cigarette holder inside your helmut?' 'Kwoool.' 'If your glasses fall off of your head inside that space helmut, it's okay, just take the dumb helmut off.' 'Hey, what do you think is in this cave?' 'Oh, no! It's a mean alien!' 'Listen, there's a weird sound at the door, let's open it.' 'Oh no, it's a mean alien!!' 'Why don't you like us? I have to know.' 'Wow Dad, you look like you are my great great great grandfather while I am still so young and pretty' .........at least the Alien series had Sigourney and a modicum of decent acting in it."
2,Not this time.,"Every once in a while they get it right. Not this time. With so many added and unnecessary scenes it is hard to figure out if they even had a screen play or if they were just winging it on the set. While it is not all bad there is enough to make you shake your head and wish they had called you up and asked for your advice. FX cannot save this film any more than a good guitar player cannot save a bad drummer. When it is bad at a deeper level it stays bad. This franchise has always had a problem with hit and miss films. This one is off target in the plot, consistency of characters, confusing and inconsistent motivation of characters and sometimes it comes down to just adding things because they think we expect certain scenes. No, we want to be wondering what will happen, not predict it as we go along. If you have not seen it you are one of the lucky ones."
2,If you are an Alien or Aliens fan don't bother,"First of all I think Ridley Scott is a cinematic genius and I REALLY wanted to enjoy this film but despite stunning visual effects the casting is weak ,the actors have no chemistry at all, the plot (such as it is)is weak & muddled , and since there is no character developmemt at all that I had no empathy for the characters that made Alien & Aliens such classics.IMHO The acting is wooden, the dialogue embarrassingly dumb, stunning visual effects,lighting & sets are not enough to make a great movie.When will the big studios learn that you need a great story and script first !!! , THEN a great director can do their magic.I've heard from several folks who think I'm way off but to anyone who saw Alien on the big screen when it fist came out then you know what I mean."
1,A notch below awful.,"I had very, very high hopes for this film - even Roger Ebert called it ""magnificent science-fiction"" in his well-respected column. I don't know where to begin in my disappointment. Just read through these ""1 Star"" reviews on Amazon.com. Most of them are right on - I couldn't say it any better. Personally, what bugged me the most were the characters in the film - totally boring and non-believable, a complete mis-casting. And the movie simply was not scary, not one scene! Furthermore, all the alien monsters we've seen before in Scott's films - nothing new. Finally, the whole premise was convoluted and nearly impossible to follow. I suspect Ridley Scott and his gang are laughing all the way to the bank on this one. They pulled off a major dupe job."
4,Good but.....,"We enjoyed the movie. I did not realize that this was a prequile to a series my wife likes. Half way through the show, I asked my wife if she thought it was like such and such and she laughed at me. Lots of holes in the plot however. Unanswerd questions at the end. It was a good date night movie with the kids gone. Uh, no kids need watch this unless you wanna stay up with them later. You have been warned."
3,Basic (case),"Being a Blu-ray of FOX, I expected a better quality in the presentation!(technical qualities of the film and disc are 10)"
3,Needs more backstory,"Overall a good film, but it left me with more questions than plot line. Maybe in the sequel... A bit more on the engineers, why where they running, pile of bodies?, act..."
3,Good old scifi eye candy,"Was not bad. I felt it to be a little to slow at times and really predictable. Other than that, for scifi this had great effects and was pretty good for eye candy."
4,great movie but....,As a diehard aliens fan I was super excited to see this movie. I'm saddened that it left more questions then it answered.
4,Prometheus,Gran pelicula una de las mejores peliculas de alien que he visto.y el final una joya y muy entretenida la de principio a fin.
1,RIPOFF ALERT,"I bought blu-ray disc with digital copy. Used MAC. Followed instructions. Digital copy did not download through iTunes store, but user code shutoff anyway. DO NOT BUY!!"
1,"Disc hanging up during playback, new version","Anyone else have issues with disc playback hanging up freezes for 1-2 seconds every 3-5 mins. This is for Blu ray version played back on Sony blu ray player, thx!"
2,dissapointed,"I have to say that Prometheus was one of the biggest let downs in film for me in years. I was expecting it to be a true prequel to Alien and was beyond disappointed after the film ended. The horrible acting, numerous plot holes and general lack of scares had me leaving the film with to many unanswered questions and a general feeling of being let down by what i was hoping to be one of the greatest sci-fi movies in years."
1,Gross!,"Could not even finish watching this movie. I knew it was going to have some things that I would find a tad bit nasty, but to make me close to being on the verge of throwing up!!!!"
1,Incredible waste of time,"There is no substance to this move except for some special effects. The characters seem to be brain dead, it feels like a ""zombies vs alien"" movie."
3,Only interested in Extended / Directors Cut edition...,"I was hoping for way better.I had immediately placed this pre-order in my cart when I saw it. Having now seen the movie, I'm only interested IF they included what they obviously must have LEFT OUT from the theatrical release.Even with an ""extended"" edition, if it not >45-minutes< or more, I may not even bother!For a trillion dollar mission, and THE most important mission Man could ever undertake, I think they could have found a more intelligent and mature set of folk for the task at hand, not the handful of bumbling fools seen here.For any movie to be successful, you have to develop your set of characters and show how they each deal with the situations presented to them, in the hope that you begin to care about them and perhaps identify or bond with them.I didn't hardly care about these characters at all, and unfortunately, it appears the movie didn't care about them either."
3,alternate expectations,"It was a great space movie, and I could see the ties to promethius and creation of human kind, but I was expecting, from the title, a monster movie."
3,More horror than science fiction,"I was jazzed to begin with that a new science fiction movie was coming available.I am guilty of not researching the movie more thoroughly on the web before renting it.On the face of it, it is not obvious that it is set in the ""Alien"" universe. My first clue waswhen I saw the hologram saying ""Wayland Creating better worlds"".There were some good special effects, but mostly creepy ones. It was not a bad movie,just a let down that it was going to be horror and not some uplifting plot.I suppose it was worth renting, but I was hoping for something classy like Avatar."
2,Two hours lost forever,"Very disappointing. Luckily I just rented it. Looks like it may have been over edited after it was made, but what you get makes no sense and therefore makes you not care what happens to anyone. Spend your money on something else."
2,Seemed lk a hugh waste of time,"Scott if u wanted to do a remake of the Alien franchise please just do that next time..this movie was a boring,dull and lifeless failed attempt..ughhh highly dissappointed in this film"
2,Alien fan,"The visuals and a couple of the main characters were pretty good, but just about everything else was bad. The story didn't have much there, like the alien movies. Most of the characters were complete idiots that I was hoping would die. I think Ridley Scott has lost the touch."
3,ok....not scotts best,Was expecting more out of this film..I did not think the cast went well together. Seemed like the story line was a little odd
4,Another Commercial Movie,"The movie its nice but it fails way too short of the standards imposed out there by previous movies (e.g. Avatar, Lord of the Rings). Its plot is based on an idea that is not elaborated enough and has no conclusion, clearly aimed for a sequel."
4,Nice addition to the Alien Family,"Wasn't sure if this would live up to the hype, but it turned out to be one of the better Alien movies in the franchise."
4,"Strange, but great.","This movie was more about the evolution showing what we could have developed if mankind had not chosen it's path.I could easily see a sequel to this movie because there was so much left open, I'd put this movie right up there with the greats i.e. Jurasic Park, Avatar, and the Matrix. See the trailer: [...]"
3,Prometheus,"Liked it But thought it was kind of slow, action parts were good & it gave lots of food for thought after watching, could watch again to sort out some uncertainties and questions as to its prequill content."
3,Disappointing movie,"I think I was expecting too much from Ridley Scott. The movie is just ok. No action, no surprise, no story."
3,Failed to Deliver,Plot and special effects held promise for this prequel to Aliens but everything got muddled in the middle and the ending made no sense.
3,Just okay,"I came into this movie knowing nothing about the plot. My only expectation was that I would see an interesting space/action movie. Usually I am willing to suspend a fair amount of disbelief in exchange for good action, but I found that hard to do in this film. I thought the story and action were unusually weak. Trying to avoid spoilers here so I'll just say that a lot of things happen to a woman and she perseveres unbelievably. That was just over the top for me. It was more like a parody of Sigourney Weaver's performance in Alien than anything else. I found it reminiscent of the Monty Python skit with King Arthur and the Black Knight, where the Black Knight keeps on fighting while ignoring the fact that all his limbs are cut off. I guess I still found it entertaining and worth the rental fee, but just barely. If I had paid to see it in a theater I would have been very disappointed."
3,I liked it better after watching a second time,"Good premise and special effects. Good casting and acting as we'll... If you like scifi, give this one a view!"
4,Good prequel,I enjoyed watching this movie. I was a bit apprehensive as I liked the Alien movies prior to this one and had heard it was an attempt to a pre-story. It was a great movie and didn't have a lot of gore as my wife had feared. It was a good storyline and one I would tell people to see.
3,Meh,"I love the franchise of the Alien movies, but this fell short for me. Am looking forward to the next movies, as Aliens was better than Alien, am hoping the best is yet to come. Will always support Sci Fi movies and the genre"
3,Not what I was expecting,Movie was a little boring...I was expecting a lot more action. Not much more really to say. I wouldn't recommend it. Sorry
3,Lot's of potential but an opportunity missed.,"Beautifully filmed but the story lacks direction, originality and most of all the hook to keep you interested and thoroughly involved."
3,Prometheus,"The build up for the movie was much more than the movie itself turned out to be ., in essecense it was a letdown"
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"As a big Sci-fi fan I was excited to watch what I perceived as a high quality movie in that genre, however was let down by the banal dialogue and questionable casting, that not even the cool set and props could rescue.still was able to enjoy the movie for what it was and will be looking for the sequel."
4,Nice 3D Movie!,"I'm not going to go into details of the movie that have been commented on many, many times here but just the 3D disc itself and I can't say enough about it. I felt it was done remarkably well. It wasn't overused to be totally distracting or disjointed but carefully enough to give the depth as needed. A couple days after watching the 3D version I went back and watched the Blu-ray disc - I was so enthralled by the 3D version that I let myself become too absorbed in some of the effects to concentrate on the movie and had to watch the Blu-ray version to view the movie. This was not the fault of the movie, prooducers or so on, this was the first 3D movie I got and viewed on my new 3D TV so it was an entirely new experience for me and I got lost in paying more attention to the effects than concentrating on the program."
3,"Good, could have been better","Great special effects, kept me interested. I think the over the top ridiculous characters takes away from the movie. I know we are stretching our imagination but come on. I know in Aliens he always had crews of hard edge, back talking thugs that didn't like the straight laced person but it has been over done. Quirky characters will a little something different works so much better and helps make it believable.All in all a good movie, not too much gross stuff.I only gave it three stars because I think it could have been so much better."
4,Good Movie but some stupid characters!,"I saw this in the theater and it was good. Good scary and eerie music and the setting g inside the alien pyramid is scary. Also, the creature effects were great. However, the characters acted like retarded brags. For example, Fifield the geologist freaks out when he sees the dead headless engineer and runs away but later on, he is awed by the alien penis snake and even pets it! Also, Dr. Shaw refuses to let the team member take weapons with them when they set out to explore the alien structure despite the dangers they would encounter. We also have the scene when she takes the alien fetus out of her with the surgery pod. Her uterus was damaged and she must have had some heavy internal bleeding yet she runs around with no problems during the rest of the movie! Still a great movie!"
3,Copy protection Nightmare,There are some hilarious (and on the money reviews) on the stupidity of the crew actions but this movie was interesting and visually fantastic. That is if you view the DVD because the BLUE RAY disk is so heavly protected that after the first 15 min. it became unviewable and I had to eject and watch the DVD version.I've read reviews of other BLUE RAY movies with this problem but it's the first for me. Disapointed with 20th Century Fox.
2,Makes Alien 3 Look Good,"I waited a long time to watch this movie, and even bought the Alien Quadrilogy to prepare. The plot and character development are laughable. This movie is so bad, it's almost like parody of Alien."
2,blah,Very boring movie. I was excited to finally get to see this and was bored the entire time. Waste of my time.
4,fun but confusing,"I guess I am still not 100% sure what is going on in the Aliens universe. This movie I thought would clarify, but it definitely leaves things more cloudy. I did find the tie ins to the previous films to be great fun to notice."
3,OK,"Pretty good, but does not live up to the hype. More flash and fluff than anything else. It let me kill two hours."
3,too many plot holes,not a very good movie -- interesting concept but thats about it. Left a lot to be desired. Would not watch again.
3,What were they thinking?,"You have to be ready for this one which has become a cult classic. Sit back, enjoy the comments of others and enjoy the strangeness. Some great spoofs available."
2,What a terrible movie...,"I wasn't tired when I started watching this move, but quickly I became tired. Tons of hype, no bite. Disappointing."
2,Not worth the time,"Plot did not really make sense in several places leaving one to wonder whether they ""cut out"" sections to shorten the movie. No overall redeeming qualities.... save your money and pass this one up."
2,muddled and weak....,"As a fan of all of the ""Alien"" franchise, I am probably a bit generous with my review. I enjoy most of the films that R. Scott makes as well.BUTThe weakness here is glaring. The plot does not make much sense, especially in the context of the trilogy. The movie begins as a tense thriller, but quickly devolves into something else entirely. There is a heavy dose of moralistic pontificating (which never works in movies like this). Scott was successful when he did this in Blackhawk Down, but it does not fit here. The characters are barely likeable and they share no chemistry. And after all of those issues, it is the plot that kills the show.The only good about this movie comes from the great visuals and sound. I did manage to watch it all the way through and only yawned twice and stepped out for a refrigerator break once. And I really, really, really wanted to like this movie....if only to atone for the terrible ""Aliens Resurrection"" movie that killed the franchise!"
3,Does not match up to R. Scott fame,"Although the visual effects are good, you do not get the fulfillment of watching a good movie based on cons I listed below.I was expecting to see a much better Sci-Fi movie, at least an par with Alien or Blade Runner.I guess my expectetions for a R. Scott movie was too high...Cons: Disappointing scenario, poor character build up,multiple errors in logic flows and reasoningPros: Good visual effects"
2,Uuugh. Yuck.,"You know, it's a shame that no one thought to use an android who sabotages the mission for the company's agenda way back in 1979, because that would have been a killer plot twist. I'm being sarcastic, duh."
2,Whom the Gods would destroy...,"LIke all of us I waited impatiently for this film. I saw it in the theatre, then bought the DVD, wanting to be sure. Prometheus, aside from some good production work and visuals, is so ill-thought out one wonders if it were written by Mr. Scott's dog.The numerous howlers and structural gaffes have been well documented in other reviews, I won't make you suffer through them again. The most human character is David, the android (Fassbender is terrific). Almost every other character is embarrassing and ill-conceived (don't blame the actors).Of course we can accept honorable failures in art. It happens. What I wonder is how this lousy script got written approved and produced? Ridley Scott will stay in the pantheon of course, for Alien and Blade Runner, but Prometheus? Those whom the Gods would destroy.... I'll be trading in my copy at Amoeba toward something good."
3,Am I sci fi or horror?,"Like so many movies, this one starts out as one thing, a cool sci-fi flick, and later changes into more of a horror blood and guts one, leaving one to wonder what the makers intended. Some scenes, such as the ""self-surgery"" part, could have kept the tension without the icky graphics. There are parts of the movie that are not original, but instantly recognized as coming from Aliens, etc. The first part of the movie in fact could almost be called son of aliens in it's set up. The movies premise is set up well, and the mid portion flows well, but the end section devolves into ""this is silly, I can't suspend my belief anymore"". The end and the script lines are like, ""really?, seriously?"" deflating. In a nutshell, the movie is underwhelming but moderately entertaining. Worth a $2-$3 rental, but not more."
3,scott,"lots of promise, that ends with a canned ending that you can kinda see coming. Visually striking, as are most of Mr. Scott's efforts; a feast for the eyes; famine for the mind. Rather do "" Alien"" or "" Blade runner"" as these had a little substance along with the visuals. I felt let down"
4,The Special Effects Are Effective,"The special effects make up for the defects in the story. The beginning scene has nothing to do with the story, but the the visual effect is remarkable, as are all the other effects of the movie."
2,Don't waist you money,"This is a $5 movie at best or rental. I love si-fi, but this is week at best. I cannot recommend paying for this movie!The quality of the produce was fine by the way."
4,was all right,"for somebody who dont like this kind of movies i was pretty nice surprise. not too bad, not too bad at all"
2,Annoying,"For some reason Hollywood is intent on ruining good movie series with mocking religion. They failed with the Matrix and with Tron in this way. They have a movie following for these series just waiting to watch them, then they have to go out and ridicule 85% of the population that identifies themselves as Christians. Piece of advise, keep the story line and do not insert any religion. It would be one thing if it was just some opinions of some of the cast, but the whole story was based upon ""the creators""(of which they are label ""the engineers"").It is obvious that there was a lot of money spent on this movie. The acting is good and so is the computer animation. To me the main failure of this movie is that they try to do too much with one movie. If they would have broken up this movie into 3 parts, they could have explained much of what seemed to be rushed. Anyhow, watch it. They spent a bunch of money on it, and Charlize Theron is in it."
3,Decent sci-fi entertainment,Visually intense and graphically rich. Very little character development and somewhat predictable story... but enjoyable for a guys action / adventure movie.
2,Beautiful but vapid,"This is a gorgeous production, but sorely lacking in plot, logic, character development and everything else that makes for a good story."
2,Nope.,Not anywhere close to meeting my expectations of this movie! The storyline had no real meat on it's bones and the characters fell flat. The special effects were ok.I feel like this movie could've been condensed into the 1st quarter of the NEXT movie opposed to being stretched out into a full length feature film.
3,It's no Alien!,"It's supposed to be a prequell to Alien. But it never really showed the 'how' and 'why' the franchise started. Very good special effects, but it couldn't carry the movie. It's an okay rental when you want to kill some time."
3,It could've been so much better.,"By the time I saw this as a Netflix rental I'd read plenty of comments about it, many of them negative. Prometheus is a beautiful-looking movie, as good as any I've seen. The story, while basically a prequel to the Alien movies, is so full of illogical behavior by the characters in order to move along it is pathetic. You can see the nuggets of a good sci-fi tale here and there but eventually the movie is beat to death by an unrelenting bunch of smart people doing stupid things and getting killed by their idiocy. The 'oh duh' moments go on and on until all you can do is watch and wonder what the next blockhead is going to say or do. You have to wonder how it was released like this. Its really too bad. Its worth a look just for the visual splendor but there's no intelligent life on board the Prometheus."
3,overhyped...,"expected more of ridley scott... cgi was awesome, story lacked substance if it was supposed to be a lead in to the ""alien"" set... fun to watch, not a well thought out plot."
4,Good Flic,"Hello,I might be in the minority here , but I loved this movie. I am a huge fan of the Alien Universe and can't get enough. All movies have issues, but only some deserve to have these issues overlooked. When you get down to the big picture, this was a movie that was needed to revive this awesome franchise from the ashes left by the travesty that is the AVP movies< Predators was awesome :)>. Who knows , once this trilogy is brought back into the forefront we might get proper ""Alien"" movies again. I would even let myself get facehugged to bring this to fruition.Buy this movie :)"
3,"Its part Aliens, but stands apart","I rented this from Amazon Video on Demand. So if you have seen any of he Aliens movies, it has as much to do with that story universe as any of the other movies did. You have the Robot you're not certain you can trust, the Company folks with their agendas, the woman who survives and the aliens killing everybody.I liked the effects, the action, but while lots of online reviews rip on this movie pretty hard for plot holes and not being logical, I find most of that criticism misplaced. Turn your brain off and just soak it in, at the end of the movie there is a deleted scene which has the Engineer Alien talking and subititles which explains his side of the conversation leading to the events that end the movie."
5,My Dad raised me on the Aliens franchise so its a given....,I love the Alien movies and Sigourney Weaver is my hero so to love this movie is pretty much a given. I didn't like the end though. To not give too much away but voice my distain: The 'thing' that came out of the 'thing' was not expected and I HATED the way they made it look. Really? Teeth like that? For real?? The older movies did way better in designing the 'thing' and they started in the 70's!! Give me the 70's version any day.
4,Very good movie,This is an excellent sci-fi movie. It helps if you saw Alien first. This movie answers some questions I had about Alien. I enjoyed it and it left the door open for another movie. Could be a series coming like Alien.
3,special effects star of this movie,"The storyline and the acting moved very slowly. Visually this movie is amazing, but it all added up to lots of sizzle and very little steak."
5,For the Hardcore Sci-Fi Fan,"I won't give you the info to spoil you. I will say that if you don't know what this film is about, but you are a die hard Sci-Fi fan, you'll love this film. The film is slow to get going, and I originally rated it about a 3.5...you know, one of those films you can have going in the background while you do your Sunday chores. However, it got my full attention in the last minute of the show. And it got the 5.0 rating. And after the ending, and you're sitting there, thinking to yourself, mentally taking stock of all the stuff you thought seemed familiar...you finally realize all that came before and all that can come from tomorrow. This might seem cryptic, but it's because you need to see this film. Trust me, you won't regret it."
3,Worth watching,But not in my top 10 for all time movies. Interesting and plot really isn't terrible but not Oscar worthy either.
2,Glad I watched it at home,"Unless your in to the futuristic mindset of what is to come looking to this movie for action like other action movies, you'll be disappointed"
2,Terrible,Slow miserable depressing pointless lame plot mediocre actingSlow miserable depressing pointless lame plot mediocre actingSlow miserable depressing pointless lame plot mediocre acting
2,no plot,all of the crews problems barely or not at all link to their mission.most of its cause by them just being stops. horrible movie and horrible plot.
2,poor prequel,what a major disapointment as a precursor to the alien series.there was nothing to get excited about.big loser.i surprisedgiven the director's reputation in this genre.
2,The Coldness of Space,"A film that will either make you love it, hate it, or leave you puzzled. I think it might require repeated viewing over time to properly appreciate it, but my initial thoughts were somewhat disappointed. A fine cast and a good director ended up making a film that feels hollow at times. Unanswered questions abound throughout, and some of the characters work better than others- while I could care less about Logan Marshall-Green's Charlie, for example, Fassbender's android David is compelling. Visually it's interesting... just at first viewing, it does have an emptiness to it."
2,Wait,"In an interview Ridley Scott stated he wanted to make a movie to make people think about what it is to be human, as blade runner did. That pretty much failed in my opinion. Maybe a sequel could save it, but as it is, its just a bad, high budget creature film.I would like to see an engineer/predator crossover though."
3,Reviews were accurate,"I saw this at home. I was not expecting too much and believe the general reviews were correct. This was a movie that would have benefited from seeing in the theater for 3D but would have ticked me off for the price I would have paid. I felt like the price I paid for the HD experience at home (without 3D) was appropriate. As far as the movie itself, I can't believe it is set up for a sequel."
2,not what I expecte,kind of boring. could of been better. don't watch late at night or you won't make it while awake. if was free would be worth the money.
5,I thought it was Awesome !,I loved the new prometheus movie. I Was expecting it to be more like the other Alien movies. It wasn't much like them at All. It was actually still a very entertaining movie! I was glued to my seat and can't wait to see what happens in the next movie! It's funny how people either love or hate this movie. I loved it!
2,Alien anyone?,"While this isn't ""Alien"" it seems to me to be a poorer copy of that concept. 3D was ok, but nothing spectacular. I wouldn't buy this again."
2,A Wasted Opportunity,"This movie disappointed me. I am a huge fan of sci-fi, and love films about exploring space, first contact, etc. I thought the cast was kind of wasted. The photography was very dark. The subject matter was dark. This movie was about searching for the origins of humanity in space. There was so much potential. I feel like an opportunity was missed to say something uplifting and profound. Instead it was the usual characters creeping around in the dark and encountering a lot of gore. There is obvious potential for a sequel. In the right hands, it could be much more interesting.Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel ""To Be Chosen"""
3,OK,"Sound QA low, otherwise picture QA ok. To many adjustments on the DVD player to make work. Check product before selling please. Carry On"
4,Multiple viewings required,I should have purchased the movie instead of renting. Only got to watch it twice but figured out most of the clues.
4,Interesting Take On Aliens,Noomi Rapace in a tight suit. That's all I can think of right now. ;-PMaking a risky journey to no man's land in some strange galaxy in order to ask aliens the meaning of human existence? ROFLMAO! I'll reserve any further comments for now!To be continued ..... (just like in the last 1 minute of this movie... no one gets to find any logical answers to anything!)
4,Do you have a big screen?,"A lot of controversy over this film. Much ado. I thought it was insightful and entertaining and had long discussions with my brother over where it fits in with the Aliens universe. However, I must say - we have a small screen and you really miss a lot of important detail in this film if you don't have a large screen TV. I know... we're luddites : )Surround sound would be good too...Oh, and this film is NOT for children!"
1,Not what you expect as a fan of Alien,First of all i start by saying that i waited to see it after buying it because i felt it would be great but i was wrong. If you are a true fan of Alien then you would know certain details dont add up and it wasnt much of a prequel. Lance Henriksen was the actor who owned the company and in ALIEN VS PREDATOR was a great detail of his death and way in Alien 3 he was found out as a robot. See Predator 2 at the end as u can see the skeleton trophies. one of them was Alien related so as u watch Alien vs Predator you get the full picture of details that this movie failed to display.
4,Great Film!,"This is a great sci-fi/action film. It doesn't necessarily have the suspense or scare factor from the other Alien films, but it is well worth the watch. I watched it twice in a week!"
3,Okay,Could have been WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better. Missing character building. Dont really know much about the alien it self. Just missing lots of info.
3,Bought as a gift,"It was on my brother-in-law's Christmas list, so we got it for him. He liked it. Not really a movie I'd have any desire to see, but since I've not watched it, I can't give any further details about it."
3,An OK Prequel.,"Would've been a lot better if Charlize Theron didn't go through the entire movie like a wooden stick figure simply mouthing lines. Noomi Rapace was a redeeming factor, but Guy POearce was wasted on his character portrayl."
4,for my grandchildren,I have three grandchildren in elementary and middle school and I purchased one for each. I have one from years ago that I carry in my purse - comes in very handy and useful.
1,Spelling corrector review,"This spelling corrector is poor. It is very small, and most of the words that I entered were not included is it's memory."
3,Wished I hadn't bought it.,Keeps going to demo every time you use it. I am amazed at how many times it tells me that there are no mactchs for the word I am looking for- and many times it shows me words that aren't even close to what I need.
3,Bought for my hubby,"and it seems to do the job for the most part. You are supposed to be able to spell the word phonetically and it will show you the correct spelling. However, if your ""phonetic"" spelling isn't close to the actual spelling, then it won't help much. Example: Actual - phonetically it could be spelled axshuel, which will give you everything that starts with ""ax"" but nothing close to actual. If you are already pretty close to the scorrect spelling and just want to double check it, then this will help you."
1,"Defective unit, limited functionality.","First off, be advised that this item is NOT a dictionary, it is only a spelling corrector. If you manage to get one that works, it will tell you whether or not you spelled _a_ word correctly, and if not, give you a list of other choices, but it will not tell you the definition of the words so you can make sure you spelled the RIGHT word correctly. Thus, it will not help you with write/right, pore/pour, they're/their, etc., the kinds of words that people in need of spelling help are most likely to have trouble with.Also, the unit I got was defective. After struggling for several minutes to get it to initially power on, it worked as advertised for about 3 minutes, and then began resetting itself after every 10-15 keystrokes, abruptly powering off and back on, and randomly reverting to demo mode.Needless to say, I am sending it back and purchasing something else."
4,Good buy for bad spelers,"This is my second spelling corrector, the first being lost in a move. It works well and gives a good range of word choices. The only caution I would give is that you have to be sure to push the keys all the way down when entering a word. If not, you find your entry missing a letter or two. I use is often for crossword puzzled."
3,Too small,It's to small and hard to read at times.It will work for a while. It does the job for now.
4,Franklin Spell Check Is So Handy,"I am very pleased with this item, however, I wish the keys were a bit larger as the signs (etc.) are very hard for me to see. One who has better eyesight might not have as much trouble. I find the case is a bit stiff opening although this may get better with use.Other then that I would recommend this spell corrector. I use it very often, even when I just want to check my own spelling. The games are a nice touch too."
3,Makes a difference for me...,"I'm really obsessive-compulsive about spelling and grammar. Wish I were better at both so I keep making the effort to improve. I still have to use the dictionary at times, but this speller is a real helper. The buttons are small and it seems a bit fragile, don't think it would take a two or three foot drop. The price was just right and it really saves time. Glad I bought it."
2,It's Cheap,"Don't buy this to store personal data like names and phone numbers.Changing the battery is a pain in the butt,requires a tiny Phillips head screwdriver to remove the flea-size screws. The instructions say you risk losing all your phone list information when you change the battery ""so always keep written copies of your phone list information."" The reset pinhole doesn't save your data.I misspelled inchoherint in the spell corrector to see the correct spelling of incoherent. One ""correct"" spelling came back and it was this: ""inchworms."" INCHWORMS? Other misspelled words produce a list of possible correct spellings, and you can guess which one on the list is the correct spelling.If it were more expensive, I'd send it back."
4,Franklin Spelling Corrector Plus,Its a nice little spell checker that gets the job done. Its not the best for somebody with big hands but for the price its not bad at all. I really like it.
5,great resource,My daughter's writing teacher made this mandatory and it is a great help with her spelling.
2,no spelling bee game--child doesn't use it much,I'm disappointed because the child I bought this for doesn't use it much. I wanted something that speaks a word and the child tries to spell it and then it gives them the right answer if they get it wrong. It's not very engaging. The descriptions of the products don't say enough to tell what you are exactly getting.
4,This was a gift - have not used this myself,The receiver of this gift said it is great - especially when writing something like a Amazon review - no spell check on this review !
5,Franklin Wordfinder,"I purchased this for my wife who does a large number of crosswords every day, to replace another similar item.She tells me this new one is ""totally wonderful"" I was also very pleased with the time it took for the item to be received which was sooner than expected."
1,A Waste Of My Time,"I selected this item for a family member who always comes to me for the correct spelling of varied words. Now my phone rings at the same pace as it did before purchasing the product because it does not have most words in it. They even showed me how this item does not work. I typed a number of words in with one letter off from the correct spelling deliberately to see if the product is acting as has been reported to me, and guess what, that is exactly it, none of the words listed as possibles for what I wanted were even close to the word needed. This item was a waste of money and hopefully it is not too late to return it."
4,"Super speller, Hotest machine in town","I purchased this for my son,and he is taking some collages courses after being out of school for several years. He has nothing but favorable comments and statesthat it works very well and gets answers very quickly. He is completely satisfies with your product and we will continue to buy products from you. BN"
4,Spell checker plus,This is a good spell corrector and it also does other things like it is a phone book and it can play games. This is good purchase for anyone who needs it.
1,SUCKS,I WAS TOLD IF I CAN NOT SAY ANYTHING GOOD THEN DO NOT SPEAK. COME ON CHRISTMAS EVE. TO LATE TO RETURN. SO IT WAS A BAD CHRISTMAS DO TO THIS N OTHERS LIKE THIS. I DIDNT EVEN WANT TO GIVE IT A SINGLE STAR.LOOKS LIKE FEELS LIKE WORKED(WORKED) LIKE DOLLAR 1$ STORE ITEM
4,Use to own an older version...,"I loved my older one but this review is a question for anyone owning this new model... Can you tell me if this model contains the definition of the words??.. Multiple definitions, like my old one did? Not one review talks about that. Please comment.... Thank you"
2,franklin spelling corector,This is not nearly as good as a franklin speller that I purchased years ago. I am disappointed in this.
5,GREAT,"I write a lot of notes to friends ,and family , but have always been a bad speller. This was a perfect gift to myself. Well worth the money."
2,Unclear readout of words in normal viewing mode.,"It's OK except after I turn it on, the monitor screen becomes unreadable. (The letters are clouded over to make it unreadable, unless I move the corrector to a particular angle.) This makes it almost useless. It just does not produce a clear printout of the words when the unit is lying flat on a desk.This is the second unit I owned (lost the first one) and they both had the same problem. I can get an answer after moving it to different angles, but this is unsatisfactory."
5,Excellent for 3rd grader,My daughter wanted this to improve her writing skills in the third grade. Because she can look up words she may not know how to spell on her own she is using more complex words in her papers now. Her teacher encourages students to get one of these so they expand the use of their vocabulary. It is remarkably cheap for the features. My daughter also figured out how to play the games that come with it too. Go figure.
3,Too small for big fingers,"This is mostly my fault.I should have looked closer at the size of the machine.My fingers are just to big for the tiny keyboard.Also i did not need a system that plays games or stores phone numbers.Also it only gives you one example of the correct spelling when others machines i have seen gives you two or three,but when your spelling is as poor as mine anything will help."
1,It's very artistic with brief moments of information.,"Embryology or Developmental Biology is very fascinating and understanding how and why cells die could have been discussed with greater detail. Even in 1997, there was some interesting theories about cell life and death along with ways cell communicate with each other. This film takes up too much time being artistic to demonstrate some simple ideas. Some of the imagery was great, but I got bored throughout the film."
3,One Eye Open,"It is an amazing fact that such educated and intelligent professionals seem to recognize the ""DESIGN"" in ONE aspect from the study of cells... but, instead of crediting the Creator God with ""DESIGNING"" the cell and all that it comprises... they attribute it all to ""evolution""... or ""existence by chance"". Their confusion and lack of judgment is illuminated by the fact that they admit science is unable to answer many questions about the subject which they have written... :)"
5,Wow!,"The best thing about this book is the pictures. If you have ever tried to read a chess book filled with notation, you will appreciate the pictures in this book. Each set of plays is shown with real pieces on a chess board. The notation is very minimal, but the number of games is amazing. It covers openings, development, endgame, and lots of ""how to checkmate"" with different pieces. I bought it for my 9-year-old daughter, who has read it cover to cover. She has improved dramatically since she read this book, and both my husband and I have to think HARD to beat her now. (He has actually lost a few, and she stalemated me once.) None of us are true chess experts, but certainly for improving from total beginner to an adequate/good player, this is a very, very nice book."
2,Not Suitable For Beginners,"My problem with this book is that it tries to do too much. Almost every page really requires something like a chapter in a book, if not a whole book. For example, Rook King endings, simple right? I am a beginner and it took me a few hours to get a good feel for how to execute a checkmate properly, and I expect there would be a similar situation for most other beginners. The section with openings also, for example, going through one line as shown really won't do much to increase ones chess knowledge, each of these probably will take someone smart at least an hour, and studying several lines to begin to get a grasp on. There is for all purposes an almost infinite complexity in chess, anyd any book that tries to cover most of the dimensions in a page is not going to succeed. To be fair I can imagine how the book could be utilized effectively by a stronger tournament player, I just think it tries to do the impossible, there isn't enough space or time."
2,Two capsules equal 1000 milligrams,The capsules are easy to take because they only contain 500 milligrams each. I thought they were 1000 each which would make them very economical. I think they should be labeled as 500 each. I have not used the product yet so I cannot comment on its effectiveness.
2,Gave me leg cramps,"Do not have a clue why, but, this product gave me severe cramps in my legs.Now am scared to use msm at all.:("
2,Teflon Iron by Hobby Zone,Please note that this iron has a teflon coating . It is not like the original tacking iron that was metal. BTW It is not a toy.
1,Poor Quality,"Like the other reviewer, I loved this iron while it worked. It got very hot and did the job. I loved it. Unfortunately, our love affair was short-lived. After a few uses, it stopped heating. Now I'll have to buy another, more expensive iron. Hopefully, more money will equal a better quality iron?? I wish this one would have worked more than a few times. I don't think I really got my money's worth from it. I hope more money will get me a better iron. Thanks a lot, Hanger 9."
1,Smoking on first use,"I did not but this from Amazon, but I wanted to write this review. I have been in the hobby for over 10 years and have used many sealing iron but this one is my least favorite by far. On the first use there was smoke coming out of the controls. I read another reviewer let it burn and the smoke went away. So I set it up on my concrete porch and the smoke did go away. This unmasked another problem though. The control knob gets HOT. I am pretty tolerant to pain but it was almost as hot as the bottom of the iron. I could only nudge it until it went to the off position. Even after letting it sit for a few minutes unplugged, the knob is still very hot. The sides of the iron are not rounded like the older irons, making it hard to do some rounded fillet areas.I honestly recommend looking for a slightly more expensive iron, in the long run it would only cost you $15-20 more (about the price of some mono/ultra/econocote)"
4,gets hot adults,It billowed white smoke when I Turned it on had looked like it might catch on fire. I turned it of and on a few times and it stopped smoking. Maybe 5 min
2,not an encaustic iron,"Amazon's frequently bought together list suggested that this iron would work as an encaustic iron. But its curved point makes it difficult to paint with and keep flat on the substrate. With more practice, I might make it work, but I am thinking of buying an iron designed for encaustic painting.By the way, this is not a toy, as classified by Amazon."
3,If you add sugar it taste excellent!,It tastes very bitter once you mix it with hot water. I think it has a lot of raw bitter dark chocolate in it. If you add bunch more sugar it tastes great.
5,Great coconut flavor...,"If you love coconut, you will love this! Plus it is 0 trans fats, no hydrogenated oils, no cholesterol, and gluten free. While it may have some artificial stuff in it, at 60 calories, that is less than any fancy Starbucks drink...and costs a lot less."
4,80's ski action,Greg stump goes Avant Garde / surreal?Great 80's concept.Maybe the viewer needs to be stoned or on a trip?I liked it anyways!
5,The Doing Method in action,"How fun to see the Doing Method in action, Deliberate Orgasm: The Technique of Peaking and Extended Orgasm gives so much information about how to extend the orgasmic pleasure, this is wonderful. It has a demonstration of a 30 minute orgasm and shows in details the sign of orgasm in a woman's body and the Doing Method technique the man uses.I read about it and it is so fun to see it in action, Deliberate Orgasm works, it brought so much fun to our sex.We go back to using it regularly and it keeps on bringing new surprises to our sex together.I also lovedOrgasm at the First Touchfor the insight on female orgasm."
5,"""Realistic but still personal""","This DVD is unique in being sincere, candid, and considerate of sexuality. Explicit and unabashed - how sex is supposed to be. Realistic but still personal, and thankfully, none of the rudimentary film work that you find in porn flicks.I can say that I have felt at a disadvantage with dating and what women expect from me in the bedroom. Learning how to produce an orgasm in a woman's body is the first step, and this DVD helped me with that. When I got into a new relationship, from the beginning we were entirely straight forward and comfortable with one other, and this was in our sexual lives too. Fun, simple, and loving sex, different then either of us have had before.This DVD introduced me to an entirely new way of thinking of my sex life. The orgasm shown is not focused on just the up and over, there is a lot more to it than that."
4,Good how to manual,"This is a pretty good book. I think it delivers what it promises. it's kinda a quick overview/manual book. I am the parent of a child with Autism and I am always looking for ways to connect with my son. I am always searching for how to communicate with him, how to direct him to follow directions and how to make connections with him.This book covers some straightforward tips, reminders and tools for parents. Kinda like a high-level how-to book. and it explains the theory behind the ideas it advocates.The book is kinda thin and has lots of space in the margins, so don't expect an overabundant wealth of information. But this was a nice compliment to my arsenal of ideas on how to communicate with my son."
3,1998 edition is 5; 1999 is a disappointment,"I was spoiled by the 1998 edition so relatively speaking the 1999 edition is a disapointment. I liked the smaller size, lighter weight, and more comphrensive 1998 edition much better. For some stupid reason the publisher increased the dimensions of the book and used heavy gloss paper in the new edition making it 3x heavier, harder to read, and very flimsy... exactly what you don't want in a reference book. Hopefully, the publisher will realized they screwed up and go back to the proven dictionary format and add more java apis while they're at it."
1,Disgusting,"Unlike the previous reviewer, I could smell the air ""freshener"" in the cherries. It smelled more like the armpit of someone who eats a lot of cherries than any actual cherries I've smelled. After several car rides with the window open (in cold weather, I might add) to get rid of the smell that I had paid to put in my car, I removed this piece of poo and put it where it belongs: in the trash."
3,"Really cute, smells OK","Not the most potent of air fresheners, the Cherries are made from a scented gel and I am not sure if they will dry out in time but they are certainly entertaining in the car."
1,do not buy,if you love your pets do not buy this product I gave it to my dog sasha and later started with diareah and puking blood she is not feeling well this is poison for your dog!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"""puppy"" size only for dogs up to 20 lbs","If you are considering getting these worm pills for your ""puppy"" please note that they are only good for dogs up to 20 lbs. My puppy was right at the 20 pound mark so I guess they worked (it says allow 2 weeks before examining stool.) Anyways, if your dog is close to the 20 pound mark, go with the full size formula and just break the pills in half (which it suggests on the packaging.)"
2,Not the same as Heart Gard,"My vet recommends HeartGard which requires a prescription and costs a lot more. One tablet contains:Active Ingredient AmountIvermectin 68 mcgPyrantel 57 mgHartz Rid Worm for small dogs contains only ""22.7 mg Pyrantel base as Pyrantel Pamoate"".I am not a vet, but I understand that HeartGard treats heart worms that Hartz Rid Worm does not treat.I have used both and my vet says the dog is fine. But I worry that the cheaper product is not as effective as the prescription product."
2,'Something lacking.,"Our poor dog continued to scratch for fleas relentlessly, after we dosed her with this Hartz product. You can do better."
5,Just One Of The Girls,A great movie.If your a fan of Corey Haim you'll love this movie.You'll laugh all through this a very funny movie.
4,If only we could be!,"I first saw this film in Sky Movies in 1994. It was a funny childish film to watch, and do recommend buying this film. Corey Hame one of the last 80's teen actors, plays a boy who undercovers as a woman to get by in high school. So if you were around in the early 90's and loved to have fun, this one's for you darling."
4,Great Movie!,"I have to tell you that I am a huge fan of Corey Haim so I rented this movie. I expected it to be corny and cheesy, but I really enjoyed it! I think you should get this movie because of great comedy and of course, COREY! Nicole Eggert is in it as well so if you are a fan of hers, you will enjoy this movie too!"
2,ALANIS MORISSETTE IS IN IT!!!,"I am a major Alanis fan, and yeah it took me a while to find she is in this movie! That's right, Alanis MORISSETTE is, but at the time this movie was made she was just ALANIS and a teeny dance bopper. But her part is cool!"
4,brilliant and outstanding,Brilliant storie but explict scenes and better uderstanding of the teenage mind
5,Use caution while driving!,"I thought Fired Up was great, Fired Up 2 is even better! Every song on this CD is great. Especially Sandstorm - I was driving around listening to it today and ended up getting pulled over for speeding...try and explain yourself out of that one! I highly recommend getting this, you won't be disappointed."
4,Just as strong as the first Fired Up!,"I liked Fired Up 2. I've been listening to it the past several days. Most of the songs I've heard on some other dance albums, but one of the standouts is the Hani remix of Kelly Clarkson's Miss Independent. It just puts her in a different light. It makes the album version sound like a Puff Daddy remix. The smooth keyboards and rapid paced sound actually works for Kelly. Don't know if she actually sang on that song or if Hani took the vocals from the album song and put it in that remix. All the songs from Amber, to Daniel Bedingfield, to Toni Braxton to Deborah Cox to Dirty Vegas' funky Days Go By are on here. The only song I hate on here is Fatboy Slim's Weapons of Choice. This song suffers from having too many samples and snippets going on in a 5-minute plus song. Plus it looks out of place of the more pumping dance tracks on the album. The rest of the album remains consistent for much of the 72 minutes."
1,"Company review, not product",Be careful buying from this company! I did not order this particular product. The product I ordered on Jan. 29 was on backorder supposedly for 30 days. I okayed the order anyway. Now they are saying it won't be here until June!!! I don't believe I will ever receive my order. Beware of The Company Store's claims!!!
1,Get a Liksang adapter and a PS1 or PS2 pad instead.,"My Saitek's were good, they weren't ""great."" But I got a Lik-Sang ""PS1&2 to USB"" connector for my birthday and I also found a free key and mouse mapping software called Joy2Key, it doesn't have a fancy graphical interface like Saitek's software but it does the same thing and without taking up nearly as much CPU.Instead of being worried about breaking my d-pad, not having enough buttons, and sticks with barely any resistance to them I am using a Playstation pad for my emulators and PC games now.Stop looking for a rugged PC gamepad because they simply don't exist. Controllers built for consoles will always be alot more heavy duty than the ones made for PC. And if I don't like the stock PS1 pads, I can use any other aftermarket pad that has a playstation plug on the end. I like Madcatz 58016 personally."
3,Great while it lasted,"I loved this controller for my basic video games, probably not great for FPS games.My main complaint is that this controller is very vulnerable to static electric shocks. I owned two of these controllers and both of them stopped working after receiving a little zap of static electricity. Very disappointing; I might look into getting a USB connector to try the more rugged console controllers on my PC."
3,It works,I had surgery and needed to play games on my computer. It worked for what i needed to use it for.
4,Does the job,Usb connector got for my laptop to play some emulator games works great after figuring out controls. Purchased 2 of them both work fine.
1,NOT BORN TO DRY !,"REGULAR WHITE T THAT LOOKED GREAT WHEN I RECEIVED IT BUT AFTER THE FIRST X I WASHED IT , IN COLD WATER AND DRYED ON LOW LIKE IT SAID IT FADED LIKE I WASHED IT 30X I ACTUALLY BOUGHT 2 WHEN I ORDERED AND THE DRYER HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PRINT FADING LINE DRYING DOSEN'T STOP IT EITHER IT WAS REALLY A BUM BUY BUT THATS JUST ME.................B.COOL !!!"
1,"""Cannot support a large amount of simultaneous high-traffic connections!""","After a long time trying to troubleshoot my connectivity problems in my netgear GA302T, talking to netgear, replacing the original card, etc, my problems continued.(...)""The GA302T cannot support a large amount of simultaneous high-trafficconnections that exist when using programs such as a bittorrent client.""Why else would you want a gigabit adapter if not for high-traffic uses?"
4,vader time,awesome toy my son loves it but after a few matches against his other wrestlers his arms get loose and wont stay up. I think its a problem with certain series of figures.
4,A Superb Actor,"Just as he did with his highly entertaining and detailed look atClaude Rains: A Comprehensive Illustrated Reference to His Work in Film, Stage, Radio, Television and Recordings, author John Soister brings his erudite but bemused viewpoint to the German-born cinema pioneer who is remembered today by far too many as ""that guy who played Nazis."" Not only was Conrad Veidt a far better actor than most of the films he appeared in--but he was an exceptional human being who was an early and outspoken opponent to Nazism. Read this book and see his movies."
2,Not Comprehensive Enough,"I found the book to be short-handed in the number of programs it reviews. While it offers comparative charts for easy reference, it only includes forty or so Nursing programs around the country in its graduate profiles. This book might be a good primer for someone looking for undergraduate programs (it includes notes on campus life and local climate), but it is severely lacking in choice--especially on the state college level!"
3,Not the best,"Same basic plot Ryan and Company land somewhere and discover that al is not as it seems. This is in my opinion a total worthless story, unless of course you like the charecter Mike Brother although I never did."
2,"Cute, mildly clever Seussical take on the Haggadah","""Uncle Eli"" presents the Haggadah as Dr. Seuss-like verse. As the range of opinions in the reviews indicates, some people love it, some don't. We tried using it as a supplement to our regular Haggadah when our kids were Dr. Seuss-loving preschoolers, but found that most of the verses were very long and not clever enough to be worth the extra time it took to read them. Very short excerpts would probably liven up a seder for kids who are already familiar with the traditional service. Many of the verses are available on the web (a search for ""Uncle Eli's Haggadah"" should take you there) - check it out for yourself before buying."
3,Mediocre,I wanted to get some good material from this to write a fun Haggadah. I could find nothing worth keeping. I gave the book away.
5,An absolutely divine gift from heaven!,This album is a true gift from heavenly forces above. It is fused with powerful mystical chants and instumentals that can elevate the listener beyond time space and motion. This album can truly take you to great places if you allow it. So bless yourself or a loved one and buy this album also remember to please bless the great artists that have produced this holy work for they are truly of divine nature.
4,Review by Glen.,This book is very informative. It takes some time to read and learn but is worth your time and money. I have been reading palms for over a year now and this book is the main book I read to learn the art. I love the book and I hope you'll like it too.
1,Shameful,"I began reading this book when I spoke with a few friends who recommended it to me. After speaking with others, I realized that most, if not all of these reviews, are written by associates of the author, himself. One has to wonder how hardpressed an individual must be if he feels it necessary to convince his friends to write glorious reviews in order to bolster sales. By the way, in spite of this, I couldn't bear to finish the book. It was too boring and self-indulgent. Truly pathetic."
5,Awesome!!!,"The title was what got me.'Sumdar' I just wondered what it meant.And right now all I can say is I am still guessing.It seems likea certain race(?) of people, or certain culture,or maybe a certain time. I don't know. But that is why this book is so awesome.I guess I've seen some well done fantasy fictions but alot of them were disappointing because of their lack of thoroughness. I think the best fantasy stories are when you don't feel like it is a fantasy story. And this is how this book feels like.You keep telling yourself it isn't real but it keeps youwondering if it is.Can this 'Sumdar be real and am I one...?I think a new era of fantasy books has been born.Totally awesome and totally a new legend."
1,Spongebob Squarepants: The Battle for Bikini Bottom,I got my game and it wouldn't work. Looking at the game and case you could tell that it was fake and I wasted my money buying it.
1,WRONG FORMAT,"the game shipped to me has the wrong area code it is PS2 PAL not NTSC, I can't even play it."
1,boring,"this game sucks. it reminds a sponge that live in a moldy pineapple under the sea. The thought just scares me. it makes me fear sponges dont by tgis game, ebay rocks amazon sucks"
1,THIS GAME SUCKS!! STAY AWAY!!!!!!!,"the thing is,Disney and Nickelodeon suck at making video-games!they're perfect at cartoons and movies,but absolutley suck at video games!!!! Its an abomination to video games!!!(just trying to be dramatic.)and this is probably the worst of them all!!!!whatever you do,STAY AWAY FROM DISNEY AND NICKEODEON GAMES!!!!sincerly,kenny"
4,Review by 8 year old,"I can't get any more golden spatulas and I can't find anymore. Once you get half way through the industrial park, it gets a little hard. The hard parts in the industrial park are Spongebob's dream and Infestation at the Krusty krab. It's still fun, but I usually get mad. I would recommend this for kids that are older than me, like 9 or 10 year olds."
3,It's ok,I bought this game yesterday. I played it and that was it. It's not that challenging but still fun. The first one you play is really easy. There aren't that much stuff to choose from though. Some parts are a bit challenging but not much. If you like spongebob you will like this game i bet. You can play it a couple times over but about the 5th time you get really tired of it.
4,fun for smaller kids,"i rented this game in anticipation of purchasing it for christmas. I have three boys: 4, 10 and 13, and a big boy (my husband). My 4 y/o LOVES this game. I love to watch my son play this game, as does my husband, and also the 10 and 13 like to watch; however, my 10 and 13 y/o don't really seem to get into playing it much, and my 13 y/o is a real ""gamer"". So it is my OPINION that younger kids will like this game, but not older ones. Also, i think the graphics are not as good as i would have expected; it sort of looks like the old playstation games graphics to me (I rented it on the XBox system)."
4,Great for younger players,"My 8 year old is able to play the entire game without adult help. The game, though challenging, is not too difficult to handle."
3,Not the best.,The game is hard and it is not like the super spong. You will need a good player for this one.
1,Trash! ...don't waste you're time and money....,"I purchased this game for me and my children and we did not find it fun at all. We've enjoyed numerous platform games, but this one does not have much to offer. Monotonous and mundane...I would look elsewhere for an enjoyable video game...try simpsons hit and run...spongebob ""battle"" is HORRIBLE!"
4,SpongeBob,"this game stinks,...I hate this game. Its so ghetto and lame it has the same background for each leavel. It has nothing new and is sortof dumb ... I hope I've clearified that this game is not worth buying . If you have any commoin sense you wouldnt even look at it!"
4,Fun Game,There is lots of platforming and good action. It has good controls and good camera view so I can see good.
4,Lots of Fun!,"This game was so much fun! The levels were so colorful, and well-done. You can visit caves, mountains, fields, and even play in SpongeBob's house! There are many times in the game where you have to think hard, and times where you can just whiz by without too many problems. You can play as SpongeBob, and occasionaly Patric, if I remember correctly.I would recommend this game to people who like SpongeBob, as well as people who don't. I enjoyed it!"
3,Fabulous when it works,"This is a really beautiful game, and Jonathan, who is 6, loved it to pieces. Unfortunately it only starts occasionally. Our other PS-2 games are fine, but two copies of this title froze on the copyright screen most times we tried to load it. Jonathan only got to play it twice in two days!Very disappointing, and we wouldn't have minded so much if the game wasn't so good when it *did* work."
4,cool game,you get eght goldin spachalas on each leval and you do lots of fiting chos from three caripters and ten plaesis to go so you shud buy this COOL game
1,jad,This book is a waste of money and time. Blind hate and propaganda driven by ideology and a false sense of history.
4,Good,"Old music vs. new, old methods vs. new methods, digital vs. analog, all these ""enemies"" are presented here in detail coupled with an analysis of cons and pros of every part involved. The book is a bible for those just starting in the music industry, and a revelation for people that have been in the business for a long time. New technologies and methods take over the old school and many people have a hard time adjusting, this title will help all these people get through the transition easy and without problems."
1,I can't get into this one!,"I am so disappointed with this book! I have been trying to read it for two weeks, and I'm only on page 20. I find the beginning so boring, it puts me to sleep. I can't follow the characters, I can't follow the language(tone)... Maybe I will pick it back up when I don't have anything else to read."
2,Use Your Library Card,"A friend told me about Sex.Lies.Murder.Fame.Sorry I bought this one. I had a hard time finishing it.What a boring read. I like Ms. Files novels, but this was not her stye.Almost like someone else wrote this. This will not be a book club book."
2,A big dissapointment,I am a big fan of Lolita Files work but this novel stunned me into dissapointment. It was extrememly hard to get through and I only finished it to see if the ending would be highlite of the book. The character development went on forever and she seem to repeat herself a lot in this book. I'm all for my favororite authors to veer off to another stlye of writing but this is just strange and I hope I never have to read a book like this from Miss Files ever again. Please bring back Misty and Reese or even a story like Child of God would be better.
2,Difficult to follow,"I thought the theme of the book was interesting, but the book had too much going on. It had too many characters and the plot was EXTREMELY far out there. The graphic nature of Penn's behavior is sickening. I read another reviewer say that she understood why he was so cruel. I would have to disagree. There is no justification for him being such an arrogant maniac. Also with the technological advances of forensics today wouldn't the police be able to track him down ? The language was a challenge which I liked, but I would not recommend this a read for those who want a ""light"" read. Too heavy for me :|"
2,not a page turner,I'm a fan of Lolita Files books that this book did not grab me. I started one week ago and I'm still struggling to finish.
1,For real???????,"This book by far was probably the worst book I've ever read. One of my book club members chose this book as the selected book for the month. Several of the other members expressed the same sentiment.As an avid reader, I read all types of novels, but this book was unbelievably horrible. I struggled to complete it. It was slow but will add, whenever I had problems falling to sleep, after about 5 pages, I was fast asleep.As stated by some of the other reviewers, the characters were unreal. I won't discuss all of them, but must say the description of Penn Hamilton was ridiculous, especially the part about his sex life. No one is that attractive and in demand that much. This was the first and probably last book I will ever read by Lolita Files."
3,I Couldn't Finish,"This was the second book that I've read by this author and will be my last. I found this book to be very difficult to get into and just couldn't finish. If you do decided to read this book, make sure you have your dicitionary close by..."
1,WHAT IS THIS!!!!!,"THIS BOOK IS SO FAR REMOVED FROM THE REESY/MISTY SAGA THAT I DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE THE AUTHOR UNTIL NEAR THE END. WHAT WAS THE POINT IN GOING ON AND ON ABOUT PENN'S ""GOOD LOOKS"" ( A SUBJECTIVE TERM BY THE WAY)?AS FOR BERYL'S ""HIDEOUS"" APPEARANCE, WHEN YOU HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY, ARE YOU REALLY TRAPPED WITH WHAT YOU WERE BORN WITH? NO MENTION EVER OF POSSIBLE PLASTIC SURGERY. AND WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO INNER BEAUTY? DID SHE LOOK LIKE THE ELEPHANT MAN, OR WHAT?PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE. THIS IS THE LAST OF LOLITA FILES' BOOKS I'LL READ. IT WAS FILTHY, UNREALISTIC, AND SIMPLY IN BAD TASTE."
4,Nikon Coolpix 2500,"I really liked the small size, swivel lens and general ease of use.Because the lens swivels inwards when the camera is not in use, and in zoom mode the lens is still in the camera body, it is virtually indestructible. My cat grabbed the wrist strap and dropped the camera onto a cement floor from a 5' height and it didn't hurt it one bit. HOWEVER, I am sorry it has no viewfinder. In bright sunlight it is very hard to see the LCD screen. Also unlike a regualr camera, if longsighted you will have to put your reading glasses on to see the display!Dowloading to the PC is a snap, and the software was easy to use."
2,Watch out for the DELAY!!!,"This camera has 2 1/3 second delay. We got it to take pictures of our baby, and all the pictures turn out blurry because she moves after I snap the picture. It's hard enough to try to capture the smile of a 4 month old, never mind missing it because of a delay. Otherwise I like the camera, but this is a big drawback for me."
3,very good but not at night,It is a very good little camera to stow away in your bag but I would not recommend it for flash photography or to get a good close-up. THe red-eye reduction is just not there and the flash is less than desirable.
5,Mac Compatible!,"I've been using the Coolpix 2500 for a few months now and I'm thrilled that I chose it. Here's why:- Fully compatible with a macintosh computer and iPhoto. Just plug the camera into a free USB slot and turn it on to the view mode.- Excelent picture quality (2MP). Both printed (up to 8x10) as well as computer images are crisp clear and bright.- Senic settings that actually work! I've tried taking the same picture with each seprate pre-set and got different results. Even better, the recomended setting was the best.- Small, swivel lens (for protection and intesting angles), easy to see LCD monitor and price.The only things I would improve are:- Faster response time when turning the camera on- Shorter pause between pictures.For a point and shoot, I don't think you can do much better in this price range (especially if you're a mac user)."
1,Horrible Customer Service,I received the camera with a large scratch on the LCD monitor and was referred to Nikon customer service for a replacement and they have been horribly unhelpful. Also experienced similar problems as others have with poor indoor picture quality and battery life. Do not buy this camera.
3,OK - but has some major issues,"The camera take very nice pictures. And the memory card that comes with it is fairly adequate. I have two major complaints about the camera however, and I wouldn't have bought this camera if I'd know about these things...Firstly, unless the camera is 'off' the battery gets wasted VERY quickly (like 1hr)! It doesn't turn off automatically. So, if you take a picture or download your pictures (the camera has to be 'ON' to download pics) and forget to turn the camera 'OFF', when you go to take pictures, the battery is totally dead. This has happened to me many times. Also, the slide level which is the 'ON-OFF-PLAY' control can easily slide into the 'ON' position without your knowing it if it's in a pocket or purse.Secondly, it's very difficult to take indoor pictures of people. I have tried several different 'scenes', nothing seems to help. You have to hold the camera VERY steady in order to not get a blurry pic.Maybe some of the higher priced Nikons are better."
4,disadvantage,i wrote a review about this camera before but i forgot towrite a big disadvantage which is:WHEN LIGHT IS POOR THE CAMERA CAN NOT FOCUS!!!THERE IS NO INFRA-RED SENSOR IN THE CAMERA OR A BUILT-IN LIGHT FOR THE CAMREA TO FOCUS IN POOR LIGHT CONDITIONS ( THIS OPTION IS AVAILABLE IN SONY CAMERAS)NOTE : MY PREVIOUS REVIEW TITLE WAS (i love it) please read it i think it is helpful
1,Not for indoors,"If you want to shoot some indoor pictures of your children, stay away from this model! Even in a sunny day, you can't shoot clear pictures without flashlight. This maybe an ideal camera for shooting still objects. Not a good choice for parents."
3,Bad night or dark pictures?,"Well I bought this camera as a gift for someone and I am now regretting it. We can't seem to get it to take any night or dark pictures. There are 12 different modes on for the different background settings, like portraits, back light, etc. None will take a good picture. And, if you slightly move the camera in the darker settings, its ALL a blur. I am very disappointed. My old Olympus Camedia works awesome still. I am now thinking about returning this camera. Oh, and the video mode on this camera... forget it. Sure it will shoot video, but there is no sound and if you don't have day light and a lot of it, its no good. My next camera choice might be another Olympus or a Sony. I think the best way to judge these cameras is to ask others what they are using and look at their pictures. So far the sony is the best I have seen. Very rich in color."
1,Don't waste your money,The camera went dead after 18 mos. You could view the menu but the lens would not display an image. I doubt I will ever own another Nikon digital camera.
3,It aint simple to use.,"They call it 'point and click'. Well, maybe that's true after you spend a day or two with the owner's manual. Maybe all digital cameras are like this, but understanding all the options and setup is difficult for me. Then, transferring the pictures to my pc and actually producing prints is not trivial (to me).Someone else remarked that the LCD can't be read in the sun. I wish I'd listened before I bought this camera. It is IMPOSSIBLE to see. The camera has no veiwfinder. Nikon should have at least included the LCD hood with the camera. And, AMAZON, should at least sell it! I ordered one from another online retailer. Maybe I should just return this hard to use toy?"
1,the worst I ever seen,"I bought it online, it looks cool, but when u take pics, u will find the pics color is worst, too bad, and too dark, pic r not clear too, it's the worst I ever seen, it's made in Malysia, that's why it price drops so quick, I recomand Canon power shot s30, it's realy good stuff, and it's made in Japan. that's the answer, even more expensive"
1,Too Cool Nikon,"I selected this camera based on Nikon's reputation and glowing online reviews, but disappointment set in right out of the box. The pseudo-metallic plastic case gives the camera a cheap, toy-like appearance that belies its cost. I found the twisting motion required to open the camera for use awkward in the extreme given the small size of the unit,its rounded edges and the need to keep fingers off the LCD screen and the lens. With no real place to hold on to, my hands got tired after a few minutes as I maintained a tighter than normal grip. Too bad. The specs show this to be a capable tool, but form should follow function, and the Coolpix 2500 is too cool to be a real camera."
3,Good but...no viewfinder,"Very good features, but there is NO viewfinder. This means you have to use the LCD screen to see what is in the cameras view. This does NOT work if either: 1) you take pictures outside which makes seeing the LCD very difficult; or 2) you need reading glasses, which I do. In this case, you need to put on the glasses to see what the camera sees and take them off to see what's going on around you. A big pain!"
4,Perfect Pocket Digital,"This is a very solid little digital that should easily take care of 99% of your picture taking needs. It easily slips into the pocket, clever lens protector, nice, crisp LCD screen.I had problems loading the software as once loaded, my PC could not see my camera. However, I used the Tech Support line which was quick and professional (had some issue loading the driver, but easily fixed)."
4,Coolpix quality,"This camera has almost all the coolpix photography options as the more expensive coolpix 995. The menu is easy to use and its use improves the image quality. Pressing the shutter half way in will set the sharpness and lighting thus allowing for even more manupilation of the image quality. On the otherhand the camera can do point and shoot as well. Some reviewers questioned the lack of a filter to protect the lens, but the filter is but in and when broken can be replaced. Drawbacks? Digital photography has its limits (like color saturation, number of pixels compared to price) and this camera seems to handle them appropriately. For higher quality in resolution and color saturation I go back to 35mm SLR camera with film."
4,Very good camera with one drawback,"We bought this camera when our baby was born and have been very happy with it. The one drawback which has proven to be a challenge is that many, many photos we take have a significant red-eye problem. I've been told that this happens often with babies and animals, but it seems to happen more with this camera than it does with others.Overall, however, I would recommend the camera -- it's light, takes generally good photos and is in an affordable price range."
1,SYSTEM ERROR,"Okay, for 18 months it was a reasonable--not great--camera. It's not big and looks cool, but it is also slow and performs poorly in low light. Red eye is a huge problem.But, after 18 months, the camera failed to work and displayed SYSTEM ERROR.SYSTEM ERROR is apparently a common Nikon problem and requires the camera be sent to Nikon for a costly fix. Thus, my one-star rating; I don't have enough cash for my digital cameras to be disposable, I need them to be reliable.I recommend heartily against the Nikon brand and am awaiting delivery of a new Canon A95."
3,Great camera for stills,"I purchased the Coolpix 2500 because of the compact size, the swivel lens, ease of use, how comfortable it is to hold, the attractive design, and the quality of the images.But after four months of use, I have found drawbacks. It is difficult to see the display in daylight. Also, the auto-focus feature and shutter speed are slow, making it difficult to take decent pictures of a very mobile 11-month-old.While this is a great point-and-shoot camera, it is best used for still shots."
5,"Compact, fun-design camera","This camera has worked fine for me. I bought it used, and have used it for 2 months now. I takes good pictures, is a solid camera, and easy to operate. The lens swivels open-and-close (actually you have to do it manually) to protect the camera. The zoom is good, and the keys are easy to understand and use. The menus are easy to navigate as well."
4,Love the pictures/drawings,"The stories in this book are great. I love that they bring up a lot of historical questions with my son (history of San Francisco, transportation, how cities grow and change over time, as well as how we can take care of the things we have so they last). He loves all the heavy construction equipment . But we really love the author's drawings...they are timeless.However, if you're buying this book for a young child (4 yrs or younger) know that the stories are a bit long (my 3.5 yr old sometimes has a hard time sitting through the whole thing) but they will grow into them."
5,"Wonderful, classic children's book",What a great compilation of wonderful children's stories. My family loves this book and we love Virginia Lee Burton!
5,"Classic, must-have stories to share with your children.","These stories are timeless. Sure the cars and truck (and steam shovels) are dated, but your young kids will love the stories. The Little House and Mike Mulligan & His Steam Shovel are must reads. This book helps to fill those nights when you need a story that's just a bit longer, a little richer in plot. The illustrations are simple, but truly enhance the story. These stories will entertain you and your child for many story-times to come."
1,AWFUL!!!! what is this book teaching?,"I can understand the whole sexist angle of the book in that it is from the 30's but on top of it the bad messages about the environment and the kicker (and often repeated) lines about ""working harder when people are watching"". These certainly aren't ideals i want my son learning, this book is leaving our house."
5,My 3-year-old son loves these stories,"My son loves all of these stories. This collection is well done, all the pages and text are true to the original format. I was worried that this book would be like some other all-in-one volumes where the pictures are cropped and minimized and the text is all jammed onto a few pages. But happily that turned out not to be the case... And even though the four stories all ""full-size"" the book itself is not too bulky or unmanageable to hold.This book has been a great addition to our library."
4,A near-perfect treasury,"With the exception of ""Maybelle the Cable Car"", this is a perfect collection of Burton's stories. ""Maybelle"" isn't terrible, but it certainly isn't that good either."
5,Nonverbal Learning Disorders,Great deal! Received the book in timely fashion. It was just as described. Best price and best deal I could find for the book on the internet. Thanks!
5,Excellent! Supurb!,"The difinitive book on NLD. Tells many aspects. Gives examples in the extreme of just how badly NLD can affects areas of a person's life. Was a relief because now I understand how my daughter thinks and which particular ""swiss cheese hole in her brain"" she has and because she's not as bad as the extreme examples given. But it also warned me of areas where I as her parent can help her strengthen her weaknesses. Now I know why such a smart girl can be so clueless. I love her how she is, and I can be helpful to her now."
3,Worthwhile for those interested in history of science,"Gratzer tells a bunch of stories of ""scientists gone wrong"". I found the most interesting stories in the first half of the book. These stories of scientists who so strongly believe the theories that their experiments can't help but achieve the desired results. These misguided scientists explain away conflicting results with the apparently sincere explanation that unless you want to see the results you won't be able to. The second half of the book gets more into how politics can impact science, specifically looking at Nazi Germany and Communist Russia. The book can be a little slow in points, but a worthwhile read for all who are interested in science to remind us of the importance of skepticism."
5,As It Happened - Really,"Spacecraft Films have done it again. Time after time they bring a depth of coverage to the Apollo lunar missions that noboby else can match.For me the TV transmissions are the real bonus. While I agree with Laurenc that film archive quality is supierior to TV in the 1960's/70's, television is how we witnessed the Apollo miracle 'As It Happened' - live.I think everyone's heart skipped a beat when finally the 'chutes of Apollo 13 opened live on TV.This 3 disc set has it all - the press conferences and mission control film before and after the accident. Audio commentaries by NASA personnell, and of course all the onboard film and TV.There's even a close look at the famous photo of the stricken CM taken just before re-entry, with the air-to-ground audio.Highly recommended."
5,Beautiful book with good song selections,The song selections are good representations of well-known children's songs. The artwork selected from the Metropolitan brings an additional form of art for children to enjoy. The commentary adds information about both the songs and the art.
4,Go In And Out The Window is a breeze!,"This is a lovely book of full-color spreads & clear, easytoread music to accompany anyone singing these lively, familiarsongs. 61 classic childhood songs are decorated with some of the magnificent treasures from The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Songs for work, play, nursery, nonsense rhymes, ballads & lullabies matched to paintings, photographs, bedspreads, sculptures & collages spanning 3000 years from around the world..."
2,Disappointing,"I've always been a Bobby Darin fan and remember his show from the 70's, so I was quite excited when I found this video. Unfortunately pretty much the whole thing is a disappointment. I don't know how they selected the songs presented here, but they seem to have managed to find some of the worst songs recorded in the 70's; ones that just have the same line sung over and over AND OVER. There's a lot of useless pandering with the audience which I think was mostly to give him a bit of a rest between songs as it is so obvious in this video that he was not well. He still gives it his all and you have to give him credit for that, but do yourself a favor and get ""Bobby Darin Beyond the Song"" instead. It's just clips, but oh so much better. I'll stick to that one and his CD's."
2,It was good but not Darin's song's,"Bobby Darin was a talent but, when I think of Bobby Darin I think of ""Mack the Knife"" and ""Splish Splash"" not ""Bridge Over Troubled Water' and ""Midnight Special."" He sings many songs in this film but only four are his songs. If it weren't for those it would be a one star Think of it as Elvis singing songs from Frank Sinatra (besides ""My Way"") it would sound terrible because Elvis sings a different type of music. I was very upset that I paid for this film."
5,The Mack is Back,I really liked this DVD.I just order this DVD again. Yesterday as I was trying to get the DVD out of the DVD holder I broke the DVD.His performance was awesome and his comedy was great.He tells the story of these two songwriters trying to get him to record one of thier songs and he passes on them a few times.Some big hits he passed on.What a talented human being.
3,Bobby Darin -Mack is Back,"I have watched all of the Bobby Darin dvd's that I ordered over and over. I had forgotten what a great entertainer he was. He was one of the best. I have looked at the dvd over and over, and listen to the music while I am working around the house.Shirley Hildreth"
5,Bobby Darin Mack is Back,"This is Bobby Darin last recorded performance, it highlights what a very talented performer he was. I recommend it to any Bobby Darin fan.A very satisfied fan."
5,MACK is BACK!,"Quite possibly the best all-around entertainer to ever step on a stage! Bobby was head-and-shoulders above his contemporaries... and others. Darin DARED! He recorded material (Dr. Doolittle; Milord, included here and, en francais, no less!) others would not even attempt and more often than not was successful, artistically if not necessarily commercially.This 4CD package represents a great cross-section of his work.A superb talent, great material, a superb package from Rhino! Superb entertainment in store for you!"
4,Solid Gamepad controller,"I purchased this Saitek P2500 game pad to replace a Microsoft game pad (the X-axis toggle broke off due to cheap construction).I've been very happy with the Saitek, particularly the ergonomics and the quality of construction.Ergonomically, the game pad fits very naturally in my hands and the buttons are well laid and intuitive. I don't have to hunt and peck for my controls when I play a game. Also, I'm able to play for hours with very little fatigue and the controls are very responsive.The construction is solid. I play the game pad hard and nothing has broken, yet.Finally, I would have given this 5 stars, but driver disc didn't have the drivers for Windows Vista. I went to the SAITEK.com website, link is: http://www.saitek.com/uk/down/drivers2.asp, downloaded the correct drivers to my desktop and ran them from there. Although there was an error message, the drivers seem to have loaded correctly and the game pad works great."
1,"Manageable controls, but bad durability","My sons used these controllers for about five months.That's how long they lasted.For both of them, the + directional pad broke and fell out.The plastic parts that held the directional pad was too weak.I recommend using other controllers if you are looking for controllers that are durable and responsive."
2,Low quality controller,I bought this brand new and after about 1 weeks the up on the directional pad started giving trouble. I love the pad for my N64 but I didn't like the poor quality.
1,It is junk,"This gamepad I purchased baecause I wanted to play 2 player games on my Pc. I hade made a BIG MISTAKE, this gamepad is really big and I hate the button layout. I have small hands and it feels like I have to reach to the end of the world just to use the control sticks, and it is so small, I really would not recommend it to anyone, ecspesally children. This is Saiteks worst product ever. It is junk, DO NOT buy this."
2,Not for fighters,"Although this gamepad is probably fine for some things, it is not for fighting games (emulators). A 360 (Zangief, etc) and even half circles are difficult if not near impossible to pull off. For me, there's no point in playing if Hugo or Zangief aren't usable.I tried this with both the Windows XP generic driver and Saitek's own drivers with the same results. I haven't tested the two analog extensively and so can't comment on them."
1,christmas,wish the info included fact that the ball was going to be flat when i received it..I had no way to blow up the ball and was really upset..never again
4,Doin' the Blue!!,"We bought this for my son's 4th birthday because he is a Blue ADDICT. He absolutely ADORED it from the moment he opened it. It immediately replaced the stuffed animal that he had been sleeping with and had carried around for last 4 years. It's not the most cuddly toy due to it's internal mechanism required to sing and dance but Blue is right there sleeping with my son every night and she even accompanies him on most car rides.I only gave it 3 stars for durability because one of the paws no longer activates the singing and dancing. Also, it's ""furry coat"" looks worn quickly when you take it everywhere like my son does. :-)Educational value... I was generous and gave it 4 stars because it teaches how to ""Do the Blue"" which requires following directions and sequencing.An absolute 5 star rating for FUN! The song that she sings with that cute little dance keeps my son amused even after a month of use.Now my 5 year old has one too, and they play together and have them do a duet!"
2,Not that Durable,"My mother bought this toy for my son. Although he enjoys it very much, he was very disapointed when after a week of it's use, it stopped dancing. My husband pulled it all apart to find that the Motor that makes the hands, feet, and head move was completely fried. So we threw it out. I wish it had been better made so that my son could have enjoyed it longer. We may buy him another one and hope that it was just this 1 doll that was the issue."
4,Cute Little Blues Clues Toy,"My two year old loves Blues Clues, espcially the original TV show. This neat little toy features Blue teaching your little one how to sing and dance the Blues boogie song. Press one hand to learn the words and steps progressively. Touch the other to now do the entire song and dance.While a little on the repetitive side it's a fun toy. it would have been nice for the makers to include some additional songs and dances however. it does with with a 30 minute Blues video as well though."
2,Loved it but quite expensive for what you get,My 15 month old just started watching blue with his older brother and loves it! ( we are trying to get him past boo bah because our brains might melt if we keep watching it) He loves this toy and he hates any toy that moves ( they scare him) however for 30.00 which is an awful lot for one of these it was a piece of junk and disappointed him by breaking afte 2 weeks. I see on these reviews the toy has a track record for that ehich is disppointing considering the price and the fact that you do not want to dissapont a child ever!
4,No Video Blues Clues,"The Blues Clue doll was a great toy for my granddaughter, but there was no bonus video included as stated in the add/write up for the item. I will be very carefull in the future when ordering something from this vendor."
3,Very basic,"The book I got shows it was a freebie from Hill's, but I assume it's just like the one pictured. I found it to be very basic with not much in the way of new information. This would be fine with someone who needed some ideas about starting a fitness program for him or herself and/or to add the family dog to the fitness program."
5,Another fantastic read,"I know these are older novels and I'm just catching up, but Dudley Pope was a great writer and I am really enjoying his books. On the plus side I don't have to wait for new editions."
4,System Error and Warning! Remove Lens Cap error NIkon coolpix 885,"I have had this camera since 2000 and it was my first digital. However during my sons college graduation last year I received the System Error message (which meant no pictures) and after powering down and up again received the Warning! Remove Lens Cap error (lens cap not on). I couldn't use it all that weekend but a week later it worked fine so I thought it was the southern heat. However, it has started with both errors again and I cannot use it for anything. It even says System Error then it is turned off (hmmm). Can't say I would buy another Nikon. I had a Canon for 10 years (old film) and it still working fine."
1,System Error,"The infamious ""system error"" appeared on my camera after 12 months. I learned after a searh on the web that this a common eroor in all Nikon digital cameras and the firm is doing nothing to fix it. DONT BUY"
1,System Error problem over and over again,"I really love my Nikon SLR but would never again buy another compact nikon digital camera. At first I thought I had dropped the darn thing and cause the system error. Now I know better and it has something to do with bad design by NIKON. I am very disappointed and unhappy with this since it took me years to finally decided to spend the money and buy a digital camera. I would have never expected the stupid thing to die after only 1 year of use. If you want to get a digital camera, I think i would look up Canon. Well, atleast I haven't heard too much complaints from others that own a Canon."
1,Nikon camera's and System Error,Had the camera for a few months. Now have got the dreaded System Error message.Removing the battery did not work. Camera is useless now!I will never buy a Nikon camera again!
1,A bust ... sorry,"The Foot Pedal broke almost immediately ... we didn't do anything unusual to stress the unit. I called the company and left a message requesting a little help ... they never phoned me back. If they HAD, I probably wouldn't be submitting this review.Buyer beware ... this is a poorly manufactured product. I recommend calling Grainger and ordering a slightly more expensive but significantly more reliable version of this product."
1,A book based on emotion and not on facts,"What an awful pile of clap trap. I suggest that Ms Caldicott educate herself in the fields of physics and radiation as this is clearly lacking. As a physicist who has worked in both the nuclear energy and medical radiation fields, it appears to me that Ms Caldicott skirts around any factual evidence as this would disprove her contradictory arguments and instead wishes to engender scare politics and mass hysteria.I am very disappointed that any publisher would agree to publish this without adequate research. One can only assume that their knowledge of physics is also extremely lacking."
2,HYSTERIA,"Fear mongering and hysteria are strong words to use when describing a book, but they accurately apply to Helen Caldicott's 'Nuclear Madness'. She informs us, among other things, that a power plant disaster is imminent, likely to take hundreds, even thousands, of lives. Cities such as Denver may even now need be evacuated due to radioactive contamination. While they have been unable to build any new plants in decades, the powerful nuclear industry 'controls' our lives. Finally, it may be too late for any corrective action. Is there any up side to nuclear power? None of any kind, we hear.There are several advantages and disadvantages to this kind of energy. It is all worth a healthy debate. Nuclear waste, accidents and contamination are all serious concerns. But it should be clear to everyone that we need all the energy we can get. Solar and wind can only generate a tiny amount. So we would do well to cut out the fear and hysteria."
1,Hysterical nonsense,"This depicts Three Mile Island as though it was a realization of the movie ""China Syndrome"".Actually no one was killed or injured. The only injuries occured when lawyers rushing to file lawsuits bumped into people at the Harrisburg airport. Radiation release was trivial.All the lawsuits were eventually thrown out of court.The meltdown catastrophe she describes didn't even penetrate the primary containment vessel.Nuclear energy will be crucial as we confront declining supplies of oil and natural gas."
4,Education for the Masses,"Everyone in America should read this, and her new book, ""The New Nuclear Threat."" Dr. Helen Caldicott is one of the most brilliant minds of our time and should be thoroughly thanked for her strength as a human to inform the rest of us about this horrible threat. And to the man who wrote that scaring the ""uneducated public"" sells books, you obviously don't know anything about Ms. Caldicott, who is fully opposed to capitalism. Shes a socialist, and isn't doing it for the money, shes doing it so you don't die."
4,"Great watch, but too-short wristband","This is a fine digital watch for the money!--but I was dismayed to find its buckling wristband is too short to fit my wrist (which is about 8 inches around)! Also, when I cut off one section of the wristband, I found the attaching pin to be non-removable--so I could not attach another expandable band I had hoped to use instead. So I now just carry the watch in my pocket (with the other section of the wrist-strap still attached, making it a handy ""watch-fob"" for pulling the watch out and holding it while I check the time). I REALLY LIKE the digital watch itself--but still wish it had come with a larger wrist-strap."
1,one star is too generous,"Why do people, English and American, it seems, applaud the likes of prejudiced, arrogant, offensive and sexist buldozers???A friend who knows what i think of this man forced me to read the first few pages.How can you bear to listen to the words of someone with absolutely no respect for the opinions and rights of anyone else? Like all of our right to live on a planet which hasn't been killed off by the fumes emitted by the p***s extension cars of overgrown public schoolboys?"
4,Refreshing and entertaining but makes you wonder,"3.5 stars really. The author is fun to watch in action on TV. He is not afraid to speak his mind and has a unique turn of phrase when critcally examining something. He writes in much the same way. In fact, you sometimes catch yourself reading like Clarkson talks - complete with the pregnant pauses!A light-hearted read, really. I did find some of the explanations/comments frustrating though. There is a chapter on Australia with a few outlandish statements that could be read as fact when they're not. Outlandish statements are, of course, pure, classic Clarkson but it got me thinking what else in the book (several countries I am not too familiar with) was really an embellishment - a ""Clarksonism"".But then, that'd be regarding this book seriously which it certainly isn't. If you've been doing some heavy reading of late or enjoy Clarkson's take on the world, or even just want a laugh from a different type of travel book, then this book is a good choice."
3,Marmite,"You either love him or you don't. This book delves back into the nineties, following his TV series. Filled with his usual blend of humour and surprise at the weirdness of the world.After reading some of the stories it surprised me how things have changed in those countries since it was written."
3,"Funny. But eventually, a bit tiresome.","The problem with Mr. Bombastic himself is that as much as I love his writing style, in excessive doses, it starts to sound effected and contrived. Even a tad dull. My interest started to wane the deeper I got into his essays. I say this as an admirer. Perhaps an anthology of columns just doesn't a book make. I've always loved the TV work and style of JC, and while I derived a few good chuckles from this collection, I eventually was pleased to be done with it so I could move on to something by someone significantly more clever. I am of course referring to Mr. James May!"
3,Good Read...,Very good read. Help if you are fan of Jeremy or Top Gear.The context of subject is dated but still entertaining...
3,A Light Entertaining Read,"This book is a light entertaining read. You can finish it off in one afternoon. It's not worth the cover price. But if you can get it used you will be pleased. If you are a provincial american you won't be able to understand every word (example ""get larched"") but that just made it more interesting for me.This is more interesting than his TV show. If he starts rattling on about some boring stuff you can just go to the next chapter."
3,Colorful writer,"Jeremy Clarkson uses British humor and the English language in ways more colorful and vivid than most. At the same time he is strongly opinionated and, often, irritating in the extreme. I am pleased when he hates a car which has been consistently overrated, but I grow weary of his defenses of smoking and of his right to subject others to it. He's worth reading if you can sort through the baggage, but after awhile he sort of gets to me. I am always more aware of Clarkson than of the subject he is addressing -- not always a positive element."
2,Accurate But Dull,"I purchased this to share with my students at the end of their summer assignment reading of Jekyll and Hyde. While this dvd is accurate, it is incredibly dry and quite boring. The narration is done by someone who sounds bored with it all himself. It is not done to the standard of interest that an A&E Biography will have."
1,Where's the science fiction?,"I hated this book. I realized why. The story is set in 2235. Mankind has developed a faster-than-light drive. Other than that, the entire setting is pulled directly from the late 20th century. The director of the space exploration agency wears a white blouse and blue pants. A pilot grabs a bagel and jelly for breakfast. Congress threatens to slash funding for the space agency. The Arctic ice-cap might collapse. Hasn't the world changed a little bit more than that in 225 years? It's as if history stopped dead in its tracks.A writer of science fiction, in addition to creating characters and a plot, must present an imagined future setting for the story. McDevitt has created an adventure story involving space ships but doesn't seem to have any concept of what science-fiction is."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Unidentified Flying Project Annihilators.Priscilla Hutchins is now a senior administrator in the Academy, dealing with politics and all that fun stuff. Gregory McAllister is the editor of a journal of political and social commentary, so the Academy, and the large amount of money they have spent on not finding a living sentient race is one of his targets, when there are a lot of environmental problems on earth that need fixing.Some shenanigans and manipulation in the background, and the appearance of an alien threat that can apparently throw asteroids around and likely has technology advanced beyond human.A fairly dry book, no real tension, and the McAllister character is the lead for most of it, and chapters are led with various 'headlines' from the media, playing on the fact that he is a commentator, so it is like observing what action there is one step removed, for quite a bit of it.3.5 out of 5"
2,Not one of his best,Not one of Jack's books unfortunatly. The premis is good and the last 200 pages are good but the book starts out so slow. I love McDevitt and I am in the process of reading all his books and so far I have only been disapointed one other time. This book is one that you would be better off skipping. Go get Seeker (one of his best) instead or for that matter any of the other books in this series.
3,"Good Book, somewhat of a unresolved conclusion",I will keep this brief. I enjoyed the book overall and love the series but the ending here left it feeling a bit unfinished. That said I continue to be a fan of Mr. McDevitts. I have now read all the current books of the Priscilla Hutchins series and will continue to read them.
2,Tedious political backstory....,"Tedious, slow and boring for the first sixteen chapters, after which it is at least tolerable, until the last two chapters where it becomes are almost interesting. Sorry I bought it."
5,A Thinking Person's Sci-Fi book,"If you think this book has a slow pace, try reading Lord of The Rings :)From the get go I get the sense that this book will be enjoyed by those who like philosophy and world history. It has a satisfying amount of development both character and plot -wise. I have never read any other Priscilla Hutchins adventures, but as the main lady, she's not bad.From the clever use of the news-editor extraordinaire character to represent the chaotic-neutral alignment that contrasts with the paragon-like protagonists, to the atypical dichotomy between the ""good"" and ""bad"" guys, this book gives us something akin to what Watchmen did to the comic-book genre. Subtle but thoroughly readable."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"About 350 pages too long. Slow, plodding, laborious, and in the end goes nowhere. I really hate wasting my time and money on short stories grossly inflated simply to make more money. McDevitt never really gives you much of any 'meat' in his perenially empty universe; just nibbles and bites of ancient civilizations and advanced aliens. But this book just gives you nothing at all! Old Jack must really have no respect for his readership. I slugged my way through his other books hoping against hope that something would come of all the thousands of pages of prose but I'm left feeling used. I'll never read another of his books again. Life is simply too short."
3,"Good, but not his best","I love McDevitt. I have everything he's written. Each time I see he has a new book coming out I jump for joy, especially one of his ""Hutch"" novels. The same happened with Odyssey. However, I was a bit disappointed. It did not hold me like Chindi, Omega, Seeker, and Polaris did. It was more predictable, perhaps because I am becoming familiar with the author's styles. Never-the-less, while being a good read, it was not a great read. The Moonriders just never grabbed me. Perhaps their ultimate mystery was their undoing for me. We are left knowing pretty much nothing about them. Maybe Jack is saving that for a future novel. If so, you can skip this one and wait for the sequel perhaps.C'mon, Jack, kick it up a notch again."
2,I wanted to like it,"I have never liked the Hutch series as much as the Chase Kolpath books (Talent for War, Polaris, Seeker), so I'm biased, but I just don't like this version of the universe...it's more of what we have, only with aliens. It doesn't seem as interesting, or possibly it's just that there are no real mysteries to solve as in the Chase books. The difficulties just seem like normal problems that some people want to solve and some don't. Added to which, I can't like MacAllister. And in this book, Hutch is no longer interesting. Mostly, I think it's that the characters are no longer telling the story. It's more like McDevitt is preaching his version of ""what's wrong with the world"" via flat characters. Boring, and almost insulting. I'd read Chindi again, but not this one."
2,Very Disappointing...,"DisappointingI have read all of Jack McDevitts books and have enjoyed everyone... he is a master of the space opera genre, well he was! Odyssey just does not work... it lacks depth, story line and consistency with his previous works in the `Hutch' series. I kept reading in the hope that the story line would come alive but unfortunately it limped to an unsatisfying conclusion... so many loose ends and you are left with wondering who is a good guy and who is a bad guy...Odyssey is extremely disappointing and not a fair reflection of McDevitts other works... If this is your first book by this author do not despair... many of his other titles are excellent science fiction."
2,"Dull, Uninspired","This addition to the ""Hutch"" universe pretty much is a bore. This book reminded me of the old R.A. Heinlein at his (bless him) worst: self-involved, boring and wordy.However, I greatly enjoy JD's work and will certainly not begrudge the man an off-color text every once in a while.I'd recommend any of his earlier stand-alone stories or stories from his two ""universes"" (the Hutch and Alex Benedict universes)."
1,Sad to say this was my first book by this author.,"I'm returning to sci-fi after many years and have discovered many new and interesting authors. I didn't realize that this book was one of a series when I bought it. In truth the story does stand well on it's own with only occasional references back to events in previous stories.Sadly, this was a very disappointing effort. Preachy and whiney with science fiction as a backdrop to support what must be the authors very strong personal and political views. One of the resons I've returned to sci-fi is to get away from this type of dour preaching.That said, I will give his other works a chance as there seems to be some consesus that this book was a departure from what is regarded to be an excellent body of work."
1,The odyssey...hmmm?,"I've gone ahead and read a few reviews on other sites as well as this one...the consensus is the same throughout...this book is very lacking. Just as I had feared. My hope was that anyone with the gall to title a book ""The Odyssey"" better have backed it up with some magnificent writing...as the reviews seem to have concluded, magnificence is lost."
3,"A solid product, but a few minor frustrations","This phone system is a solid system expandable up to 12 handsets. The bluetooth functionality of the base station is a little quirky, and occasionally, I have to unplug the base to reset it to allow my cell phones to reconnect to the home system, but by and large, this has been a very good system for our home. The expandable bases are very easy to connect, and the handsets hold their charge for a long time. One problem I have found is that the phone book feature and custom rings do not transfer from phone to phone; you must input them individually on each phone. This is extremely frustrating when you have 12 handsets, especially if you use custom ring tones to identify callers. Other than that, this phone has been very good. No interference from my electronics has been noted, and I have a lot (and I do mean lots) of electronics in my home."
5,cordless phone,"I NEEDED A REPLACEMENT FOR MY AT&T; PHONE SYSTEM.ONCE AGAIN, THE CO. GOT IT TO ME AS PROMISED. PRODUCT WORKS AND THECO. WHO SHIPPED IT GOT IT TO ME FAST."
1,Not very good.,This is an overpriced phone. The voice quality is very poor. Messages left on the answering machine are not discernible. Extensions have very short distance from base in order to work. Very disappointed.
4,See my review of the base for more details,"This handset works well, and connected to the base station without any problems. We like the intercom feature, since it saves a number of trips up and down the stairs, and the hold feature works to isolate the call while paging. The range and battery life seem fine, and the sound is adequate. This is, in fact, the only thing keeping it from 5 stars; the sound is only adequate. It's a little bit tinny, and there are moments when it's not fully duplex, but partially mutes the other party if I am talking. It's not a serious problem, but it does miss perfection."
5,Great game for young & old.,"This is a graet game, for all ages. I have three kids 5, 13. & 16 and they all love it. I also really like to play. We're having a great time."
5,Excellent for young & old!,"My 4 year old solved this game in about a month. I have yet to complete it myself, but we both find it amusing and enjoyable! I have to wait till he's in bed to have a turn!"
4,Almost perfect!,"My only problem with this game is it's way of continuing. Why should you have to write a password down?! That's dumb. Why should you not be able to just save and load? Why should you have to go to so much trouble? That's rediculous! I hope you editors read these reviews. If you do, then you'll know what to watch out for next time. Because this is so stupid I can't even believe it. The game falls short of perfect because of one thing! ONE THING! I'm tellin' ya. You shouldn't EVER [...] make a game where you're forced to use passwords. What kind of service is that? THat makes me so mad!"
4,"Needs a save faeture, not passwords!","Awesome 2D version, great graphics, sound, gameplay (other then the fact that you have to use passwords instead of a real save feature), and bosses!"
4,not a strategy game,"i like spongebob and this game isn't so challengeing i got done it in a week,or so now it is pretty fun though now that i think about it, it kind of gets harder as you go to diffrent levels,but if you want a stratgeny game i recommend MEGAMAN BATTLE CHIP CHALLENGE,but this spongebob game is good for young and old!!!"
1,Boring,"SpongeBob can only do a couple of things. His movements seem limited, there's not much of a challenge, and the characters only show caption and do not say anything verbally. My son is four and I have played the game as well."
5,Cool Adventures,"It is fun.I really,really,readlly like it.some of the levels are hard,but not that hard.I finish the game in one day.I think it should be fun because there is about 4 chapters and 8 level in the 4 chapters.If U get all the Krabby Pattys U can go 2 a bonus level.If U are in trouble and want to get to the last levl go to continue and press GGFF.That all I got to say,bye."
2,"Definitely not a Toy, but a Collectible.","We got Oo-la-la kitty and loved her. Pretty and unique. However, after only 2 days of light play she broke in the middle as my daughter tried to move her legs into sitting position. The legs are articulated at the hip, but the waist is thin and snapped internally. Husband tried to glue it a couple times, but it didn't hold either time and we ended up throwing it away.If you get it, put it on the shelf and enjoy it."
5,Good!,"The video was exactly as describe, but it took a bit longer to ship than expected. Other than that, I have no complaints."
5,Daughter loved it,Bought this for my daughter for her 22ed birthdayShe love it on VHS as a child and still loves it on DVD as an adultShe rates it as great!
5,Every child needs to see this,"This truly is one of the greatest children's films ever made. It's a wonderful story that I would recommend to nearly anyone. In this day and age of lackluster animated movies, little nemo is a title worth checking out."
4,Nemo & Icarus!,"I saw this movie many times when it first came out on video and it scared me so much! Nightmareland was terrible and scary. But I've grown to love the movie except I haven't seen it for quite a few years. Thankfully, I found a copy on Amazon.com! I'm very excited for its arrival! :o) Great movie for little kids!"
5,I'm actually 18,"I just didn't want to sign up for an account. Can't they change the ugly font in these boxes?? I had a dream the other night about this movie. It has vaguely haunted my memory for years, ever since I saw it as a young child. I'm ordering it soon. For a period of time I was unaware that such a movie existed; my sister and I were the only kids with a memory of it. I really like the tiny sliver of something ambiguously mystifying in that there was really no connection of how got planted."
5,We love this movie!!!,"My husband and I love this movie. Looks great on blu-ray, and has new special features. We are very satisfied."
2,Little Nemo is for little kids at best,I saw this with my daughter when she was in 2nd or 3rd grade. It doesn't hold up to the new animation today or even compare to some of the classic animation of the past. It's fair at best.
2,Nemo in Slumber Land,The DVD was received promptly and in the stated condition. Would order from them again!
3,I got a nice surprise when I opened the envelope from UPS!,"More specifically, I'd noticed this while unsealing the product. The entire bottom section of the DVD case is completely shattered. Expect a very flimsy, cheap product in the mail when ordering. I suggest ordering backup DVD cases. You know, just in case. The DVD itself, as well as the label for the DVD case, had both arrived together unharmed."
2,35 million dollars can't turn crap into Gold.,"You'd think a 35 million dollar anime would turn out a bit better. I was very surprised at how bad this movie was. I saw this for the first time when I was 8 and I thought it [stunk]. I saw it again recently and it didn't get any better. It's just another example of a movie that tells too much story in a short amount of time. They should have used that money to make this into a standard 26 episode T.V. series or an OVA series. On top of that, Nemo and the Princess's recording sessions must have been done in one take or something because they sound HORRIBLE!! The poor sound quality didn't help either. I will give it some points for the great looking animation and the good music. This is what happens when you put all of your money into making the movie look good and not paying attention to anything else. Not recomended to anyone."
1,Still Have Not Received DVD,"I ordered this weeks before Christmas, and now as of 1-20-2007, I still have not received my DVD. Wish I had never ordered though this company, and never will again!"
5,Mesmorizing Classic Childrens Fairytale,"I can actually remember watching this movie as a small child about 15 years ago. I cant say alot because I probably have'nt seen the film in 12 years so ... what I can remember from it is very blury and confusing. But hey If i can remember watching it as a toddler, than it must be something else ... sorry this is not to helpful but hell one thing I do know is that it's good for children!"
4,Little Nemo is back!,"I had heard that the Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland was back in print from the IMDB message boards. After making sure that it wasn't false information, I check retailers everywhere online to make sure it's back, and sure enough, we have another release!It's finally good to know that I don't have to worry about trying to find it anywhere at a pawn shop, or bid online for it, or even have to cash out over $30-$50 for an out of print version, but the relatively small price for the DVD is worth it!The DVD is subtle enough and contains a nice widescreen transfer, a runtime that is well suited and NOT cut, 3 Sing-Alongs (if your into that), and a Make Your Own Royal Scepter.It's good to see the film I enjoyed so much as a child has come back to DVD, and I can enjoy the fantasy and fun back on DVD without having to worry about every paying a high price for an Out of Print version. Definately recommended if you love the film! This will be the best way for you to view it for now."
4,Childhood movie,"I remember watching this movie as a kid. It had been a long time since I had seen it, so that was why I decided to purchase it. I remember enjoying it more as a kid, but I'm sure that's due to the fact that I was not yet exposed to today's level of animation and graphics. It was still fun to watch and enjoyed seeing that my nephews were happy with this ""new"" movie."
3,Good,"The DVD skipped a little so the purchase was not perfect. It is an old movie so that could have been the problem. Other than that, no complaints."
5,Very good,"Disc arrived in excellent condition aka new. My first year buying ALL my christmas presents from amazon and still have yet to be dissapointed by anything. My summary- Buy it new! Not used! And check the ratings of seller then pick the highest. If highest rating is too much in the price go to one thats next in line. This movie is cute and a childhood favorite. Its been up there right along with The Great Mouse dectective and Robin hood (cartoon version) Its almost like H.Miyazaki's work (totoro,spirited away,cat returns). Anyways good seller good product. 100% satisfied."
4,An excellent adaption!,"It amazes me that none of the previous reviews mentions the comic by Winsor McCay! This is truly one of the most faithful adaptions to the ideas of any work that I have seen. Winsor McCay would be proud.Mickey Rooney does a fine job as Flick, the shifty and miscievous imp. I have read that French artist Jean Giraud (aka Moebius), and Ray Bradbury are both involved with this film. It shows.This movie has an interesting plot, fascinating characters, and beautiful animation. As with most good films, there are occasional scenes which may frighten younger viewers (anyone remember the witch from Disney's Snow White?) but do not let this dissuade you from giving this film a try if you can find it.My only complaint was the superfluous character, Icarus. At least this time the ""cute animal"" was relatively low key and did not distract from the rest of the film.I hope that it is re-released post-haste!"
5,New Star Arrives!,"As the editor of a nationally distributed weekly newspaper, I get dozens of submissions from would-be rock stars every week. Most of these find a home in my cylindrical filing cabinet either because of a lack of professionalism or a lack of talent. Jeremy Manjorin's ""Jigsaw"" is an exception. The disc itself and the press kit are expertly engineered and professionally produced. The music brings to mind a dizzying combination of Rush, Dave Matthews, and Led Zeppelin. The instruments and vocals display a range of styles not found on many debut CDs. Manjorin's skills as a singer, songwriter, and instrumentalis are readily apparent. All he needs now is that magical moment when he is discovered and his music fills a void on today's over-processed pop saturated airwaves."
2,Hit and Miss,"Elmore and Heald is a very hit and miss book. The first chapter about simple transverse waves on strings is pretty good except for the confusing treatment of Fourier series (which I can't imagine would help anyone who hasn't seen them before). Chapter 3 on elastic theory was fine too and the EM waves stuff in chapter 8 wasn't bad.However, the introduction to tensors in chapter 7 and their application to more complex elastic theory was horrible. The dyadic notation they use is really old-fashioned and their presentation is confusing. The stuff in chapter 12 on fourier transforms and integrals wasn't that great either.More generally, the problem is that it spends too much time diving into excruciating detail without teaching and emphasizing important concepts. Not to mention the fact that there are no example problems."
5,Clear and to the point,"This is easily one of my favorite physics texts. Derivations are concise and straightforward. This is definitely not a ""bedtime reading"" textbook with lots of filler. If you want to get down to business in a wide-range of wave phenomena and prefer a rigorous, theoretical treatment pick up this Dover book."
5,good book,Joan Johnston's book is the only hawks way book that is not available as an ebook. The Diana Palmer book is available as an ebook but still a really good book
3,lone star christmas,"I had all the other palmer books of the hart brothers but this one. it's the same as most of her other books. I just got hooked on one of her books and now have to continue with her jacobsville , tx people."
3,OK Amplification,"IMO, this is not a 385 watt unit. That is a cumulative total of different individual features (guitar, cd, mic 1, mic 2, etc..). On the box it says 185 Watts RMS. Perhaps. It was never close to really loud even in my 13 X13 living room- I expected 385 watts for the speaker. I am disappointed with the output volume.When I want volume, I need to turn the master volume up all the way, the bass and treble all the way, and the dvd volume up all the way. With that I get medium amplification with nice voice balance. I guess for the price I was expecting too much. For the record, with the Guitar plug in you can get the amplification up to a level of some distortion and voice distortion.Also, I was hoping I could use the dvd for public presentations but I see no way to navigate a menu with this dvd. I will need to bring an auxillary DVD and run the three wires into the amp.I'm disappointed."
4,"Son loves it, drives me nuts!","I bought this for my 10 year old son, who has multiple disabilities. He loves knock-knock jokes, and we were running out of them! He will play this non-stop, and even try to tell us some of them later! He just started ""getting"" abstract ideas like humor, so this encourages more of that type of developement. I'm always looking for toys that are appropriate for him and this one fits the bill."
3,Not the Answers I Was Looking For,"This was a quick read, and very informative. It did include a lot of the author's personal experiences (making it quick), but didn't offer as much practical advice as I was hoping for. The book affirmed much of what I already know and do, but did not offer much in the way of new information. I do think I will try some of her other works that were referenced."
5,Gift order,Ordered Pippi books for a little girl who just became a big sister and want her to feel special too! Books came in two days. She just loves them!
5,Love it!,This one was for me I used to watch pippi all the time. In 2004 I tried to find pippi on dvd and it was not available. The TV series was but that was not the same. This is one of my favorite purchases!!
1,NOT appropriate for little ones,Violent suggestion and guns present that pippi insists on playing with and pressures tommy and anika to play with... that is far as I got amd then it was turned off..
4,Good experience,Good quality product. Great customer service - quick response to every questions. Would recommend to a friend. Try this product youself.
5,I love it,"This is a great resonant head. It sounds awesome. I build custom drums and I use this head because I can add my logo and it looks sweet on the ""frosted"" texture."
3,Fabulous German Singers Wrestle With Verdi,"Maria Reining, Helge Rosvaenge, Hans Hermann Nissen and Wilhelm Strienz are all fondly remembered for their star performances in German opera.Here they are challenged by music that makes totally different demands on them. They have strong ideas about how the music should go, and do their best to put their own individual stamp on it.The results are not Italian, but they are energetic and personal, an echo of a time now distant.Not a first Trovatore for your collection, then, but one for the connoisseur who feels he has enough of the idiomatic and is now in search of the unusual."
1,useless listing,"This listing tells us nothing at all about the performance, other than that it is Trovatore by Verdi!"
5,Big Bag of Bold Beans,We always look forward to a fresh shipment. The beans are are moist and good right out of the bag!
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD","This coffee literally stinks! Opened the bag, dripping with oils and I almost got sick from the smell. It is so strong in flavor you cannot make it drinkable. I find it bitter unless you add a ton of milk and sugar (not good). I do not understand all these good reviews (thats why I chose it)because it is hands down the worst coffee I have ever had!"
1,Bitter brew,"I like darker roast but this stuff tastes like ashes. All you get is a scorched burnt taste. No brightness, no complexity, just a one note over roasted French Roast. What a disappointment."
1,terrible tasting...smells aweful...to oily for grinder,"This is the worst coffee I have ever bought. It stinks really bad. The beans are very oily which is bad for the grinder (I have a super automatic). The taste is bitter and dark and strong...not smooth and rich like the Lavazza I usually get. I have no clue why anyone would give this coffee a good rating, unless the beans they sent vary A LOT and I got a bad bag. Then I tried to contact them and I cannot find any reference anywhere. Never again!2 weeks later....I want to add that I sent the coffee beans back to Amazon and they refunded my money! Thank you Amazon...once again you have proven to be a great company!"
5,"A wonderful, rich coffee","This is by far the best bean in town. Before I left the states I was drinking Trader Joe's French Roast which I really enjoyed. Fogbuster takes it up a notch. The coffee is strong, rich and has a great depth of flavor. I highly recommend this to those who enjoy a strong cup of coffee with a good flavor."
3,These beans were not fresh.,"It's hard to tell if this is a truly good coffee. It very may well be when the beans are fresh. As soon as I opened the bag there was that vague smell, almost musty and definitely stale. I made a pot anyway. (I'm cheap that way.) Honestly, the stale smell is not evident after brewing but this is a mediocre coffee at best. Maybe it would be better if the beans had been fresh, maybe not. The flavor is almost rich, almost dark, almost really good. It just somehow misses the mark. The beans themselves were, aside from the smell, decent; uniform, a good color and firm. I've had much better coffee and I've had much worse."
4,A pretty good cup of joe,"This is a good all around coffee. Nothing bitter, good flavor, good aroma (but not much aroma). If you like a really powerful brew, this is not it (don't be confused, this San Fransico bean will not bust any mental fog). If you just wa good coffee you can drink all day, this is an excellent value."
5,"This is a good brew, our OFFICE FAVORITE!","We have ordered many beans for our espresso machine (which doubles to make Americanos for some) and we have all agreed on this coffee. Its always fresh, slightly oily and aromatic. There's nothing like ""Busting the Morning FOG"" especially on a Monday. Our corporate motto is now .. ""How about a fogbuster?"" everyone says yes. We've probably had 10 bags so far."
2,Watch the shipping on Amazon and Jerimiah's coffee,"I recently ordered the following coffee: Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Fogbuster, Whole Bean, 5-Pound Bag. It arrived promptly, but tastes stale. The package does not look like the colorful one illustrated in the picture. Rather, orders are shipped in clear plastic with no information about the company, and in my case the package was defective. A seam on the side had split open, allowing air to enter, which must have affected the coffee as it tastes stale. Jermiah's, so far, has been a big disappointment."
2,Not so rich and strong.,"I must use roughly 50% more beans (and grind them finely)to get the same strength coffee as I am used to with other beans. Taking that into consideration, it's not such a hot deal. I have no explanation. I will drink it up but would never reorder."
1,The Worst,This is my second and last purchase of this coffee. The coffee beans are the most terrible beans I have ever bought. They stink and it would take my Bunn grinder 8 cycles to make one cup of coffee
2,the fog has not lifted,"I am a lover of coffee with a really robust flavor. The reviews seemed to be mixed, so I decided i would give it a try. I have to say I was a little disapointed. The coffee was just ok, nothing i would ever order again."
5,Liquid Gold Ambrosia,"Beautifu beans, aromatic coffee, like a fine wine, indulge yourself and you will never go back"
3,Countertop Wine Caddy,"I wanted something to store a few bottles of wine in. I ordered this wine caddy and was a little disapointed. It is lightweight plastic and a little flimsy. I expected something a little more substantial. It does match my kitchen decor, as it is black plastic. It does the job adaquately, but would not reccomend."
5,Standard 3-Prong Power Cord,I received my package as quickly as possible and the product was in the condition I expected it to be in upon ordering. A trustworthy site.
1,Nickel haaaaack!,"Good grief, this song is just uncomprehensibly lame-o. The ""singer' cannot sing. His voice sounds like his larynx was cut open and each spurt of vocals sounds like a dying gasp. The melody also is terrible and the song annoys me to death almost. If I was handed this single it would be shards in moments. That is all."
2,ONE SPANISH MOVIE I DID NOT LIKE,"I never thought there would be a movie with the inefable Veronica Forque I would not like, but this is it. characters do not speak but scream repetitious phrases such as: ""I'm unhappy"" several times in a row. The whole thing is done fortissimo. Acting is minimal, given that the characters are not allowed to develop but remain at the level of caricatures or stereotypes. I have seen all of the actors involved in much better movies. The material itself is weak."
5,EASY TO USE.,THIS KIT IS VERY EASY TO USE. ALSO IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND. ALL INSTUCTIONS FOR MANY TYPES OF DETAILED READINGS ARE INCUDED. I HIGHLY RECOMEND IT!! THANKS.
5,Excellent!,"This product is amazing. Our builder grade spout was not long enough to reach into the tub, so water splashed all over the side of the tub when filling. (Whoever designed that was clearly a genius). Anyway, this installed so easily without needing to use the included hardware. It looks great, is very sturdy, and looks like it was meant to be there. Very impressed with the quality of this piece."
2,not worth it,"This is definitely one of the worst cd purchases i've made. The Cd is poorly organized, and most of the music isn't as good as one would think. the songs that ARE worth listening to though, are:Disc 1:8. Halifax - ""sydney""11. Say Anything - ""Woe""15. I can make a mess like nobody's business - ""The best happiness money can buy""56. Patent Pending - ""Los Angeles""Disc 2:1. Hellogoodbye - ""Homewrecker""5. Jack's Mannequin - ""Kill the messenger""8. Matchbook Romance - ""My Eyes Burn""Other than that, this is really a minimal value Cd, in my opinion."
3,CAN SOMEONE TELL ME HOW TO ACCESS THE MP3 SONGS ON THIS CD,I have not been able to find the MP# portion of this CD. Can someone help and provide the instructions on how to access them.ThanksA lost soul
3,great lights,these lights make a great addition to a car but they are not purple they hardly even have a purple hue they look more white than anything but they still do look good and help light things up but if you are looking to get purple or hid headlights then you need to look somewhere else because these aren't.
5,Great CD!!!,This album is great from start to finish. I was really upset when I heard Kelly Hayes was leaving Cold because I know where most of the creativity of that band came from. The guitar riffs are bad ass and everything just flows like a great cd should from start to finish.
5,This is how the new COLD album should have been!,"If you like cold,Than dont buy the new cold cd buy this one.Thats all i have to say.Great Cd"
5,One of the best releases of 2005,One of my favorite albums of the year by far. Fans of bands like 10 Years and Cold will love this release. Allele is one of the up and coming bands off of the label Corporate Punishment. They will definitely take this label further.Fake (8/10)A Different Someone (10/10)Closer To Habit (10/10)Stitches (7/10)Lost In Your Words (7/10)Tight Rope (10/10)Immune (5/10)Lies (6/10)Misunderstood (7/10)Unknown (9/10)Jaydin's Song - instrumental but isnt all that good
5,For any rock fan,"I had only discovered Allele a week, perhaps two before they're debut record dropped. Just based on the two tracks that were available before the album released was enough for me. I became an instant fan. Allele's debut album ""Point of Origin"" has a unique blend of ""mellow"" and ""hard rock"" sounds. Most bands will simply stick to one side of the ""mellow/hard rock"" spectrum, but Allele does a fantastic job of blending the two sounds. Some songs start off mellow. Almost like a relaxed sound then the sound is whisked into something you could easily bang your head to, and vice versa. Pick up this album. You will not be disappointed."
5,A filthy-dirty dogpile of fun!,"Who would've thought to ask a dog for his opinion of love (and all related activities), especially a dog living in Elizabethan England? It's been a few years since I read this book, but I still have some fond memories of Mr. Hooker's opinions."
3,tree falling wedge,"wedge works well to help fall trees in desired direction, plastic material can become brittle & break in some applications"
2,Color shown wrong,We were anticipating the color to be black. It came in and was yellow. Was unaware the picture displayed on the ad was black & white.
4,The Grotto,Very good book. I had waited forever and was glad I finally got to read it. I read this book in one day. It was that good.
2,make it shorter & wider,"This is the first shave bar soap I tried. The first thing I noticed is it didn't fit in the ""Kingsley Wood Shave Soap Bowl with Lid"" I bought with it (I had to cut it). The second thing I noticed is the foam doesn't last thru the shave. There are several brands of shave cream in tubes I like more. Aerosol cans are tacky, I like holding the wood bowl enough that I'll try a different brand of shave bar soap next."
3,Mix-and-match-musicianship,"Okkervil River has been one of my favorite bands of the decade thus far. However, this CD seems to be just the scrapings of a few miscellaneous songs, with a few fillers just to justify putting it to market. Two songs of note: ""Another Radio Song,"" which has been floating around for a few years, and ""No Key No Plan,"" the only new song that's really worth hearing on the piece. This isn't to say that this album is bad, it's still better than 75% of the music I've bought this year, but if this is indicative of the future direction of OR then I am disappointed. The new Shearwater album is amazing, though, and perhaps this OR release feels rushed and pieced together because the band has been concentrating on that instead."
5,Terrific Toy,My 3 1/2 year old loves Magnatiles. He will play with them for long periods of time. Many adults seem to enjoy playing with them too. :) I also like how neatly they pack away -- a lot of tiles fit in a very little space.
1,Will not stand the test of time!,"We love Magna Tiles in our house!. We own 4 sets! They are played with daily. I've recommended to many friends that they buy Magna Tiles.However, I would not buy more at this point.The first three sets of Magna tiles we purchased have been wonderful with no issues. The last set, bought 2 months, ago is falling apart! The plastic on the sides is peeling up exposing the magnet. They seem to be made cheaper than the magna tiles in the past. (Isn't that always what happens with products, the quality goes down after a few years.)I called the company and since it's been over 30days, they will not replace the broken tiles. The guy asked how old my child was. When I told him 4 years old, I was told not to worry about the magnets falling out because my son old enough not to place them in his mouth.I no longer will recommend this toy to friends! They are now cheaply made and not worth $1 per tile!!Be careful around small children! These are a safety hazard!"
5,"The Ideal Toy. No batteries, noise or mess AND kids like it!","Like another reviewer, I rarely write reviews but want to help get the word out on this product. I stumbled upon Magnatiles while doing some other search on Amazon and felt compelled to buy based on the reviews. Well, based on our experience with our 3 year old daughter, you can believe the reviews. This product is awesome. My daughter has played with it every day so far (no 1 hit wonder here like some toys that are played with for 15 minutes and never used again). I love how she uses them creatively and also that it is not a computer game with sounds and lights. Plus, they are easy to clean up and store! And I find myself playing along. The only knock is the price but do yourself a favor (if you can swing it) and start out with the 100 pack."
5,Magna tiles stir up creative juices,These magna tiles help to induce creative imagination. Our grandchild is 27 months old and he plays for extended periods with a lot of attention to creating different images. What a super idea
5,The best building blocks!,We have a three and a five year old. These blocks keep them occupied for hours and I feel like it encourages creativity...LOVE these.
5,solid but not cheap,kids loved it they got a lot of use out of them but don't use them any more they now use computers
4,THE LP Rules!,"Having owned this since 1984 on only CD. I was blown away to hear the detail and richness that only Vinyl Records can provide. Throw out your CD player and invest in a good stable turntable, upgraded cartridge, and hear what you have been missing."
4,Loved listening to Prince again!,"One of his best, wanted to collect this copy for many years so getting this finally was great in vinyl!"
2,Sophomoric Curse!,"This, Mr. Hunter's second novel was such as disappointment! It was predictable and followed the same old formula: Man has good woman...man is a dog...man finally realizes he has a good woman...man loses good woman. Genesis was trifling - Period. After reading The Hearts of Men (Excellent!), I couldn't wait to read his next book. Sorely disappointed."
5,The New Top Male Writer,"Travis Hunter's writing is the best I've read since Ralph Ellison. This guy has the magic touch. Travis cleaverly takes a known dog and makes you love him. Genesis Styles is a certified puppy but Hunter uses his skills as a top notch writer to change your heart and have you rooting for him. I don't know any other writer that has what Travis Hunter's has. This book is a must read for anyone who enjoyes a great story. I'll have to say that I'm highly upset with his Publishing company, Random House for for not promoting this guy in a big way. There is no doubt in my mind that Mr. Hunter will be a literay star with or without the help of his big publishing house. E. Lynn Harris and Eric Jerome Dickey, You guys now have company at the top because Travis Hunter is coming."
3,entertaining,"this book is a quick, entertaining read. a perfect beach book. i might have given the book a 4 or 5 except that it's a sophmoric knock off of 'it's a thin line' by blackboard's best selling author, kimberly roby. the story line is sooo identical...siblings fighting with each other, parent gets sick, sexual abuse, etc. etc, that i'm surprised ms roby didn't sue hunter.all in all if you haven't read roby's book you will find this book easy and enjoyable, although without much depth."
5,True to life,"I loved this book. I really enjoyed the first one and this was just as entertaining. It's a shame that some of our people actually dislike us to the point that Phyllis did, but we just have to hold on and hope that they'll come around. I kinda felt the baby was Genesis' from the beginning but was hoping it wasn't. Anyway, Genesis and Terri will get it together and all will be okay. A good book from beginning to end."
4,Married But Still Looking,"Genesis Styles have attracted women from ever walk of life since he was a teenager. He's a good-looking, smooth-talking former pro-basketball player, but he has a problem: He has never been satisfied with just one woman. Then he meets Terri. Terri is his fiancee'. Genesis knows that Terri is a good woman that he wants to make his wife, but while Terri have decided that their first sexual experience will be their last (at least until they are married), Genesis has been ""spreading"" himself around town.While juggling a host of other women, Genesis had to deal with family problems such as his drug- addicted brother who doing a not so good job at raising his son, a sister that has decided to become a minister, and ever so tough Phillis who has her own faults and personal problems.I truely enjoy this story of love, lust, cheating, abuse and family secrets. In the end you will learn that it never too late to make a change for the better."
1,Not the worst book I've ever read...,"...but close. Maybe it's just me and my expectations, but this was not a good book by any stretch of the imagination. The writing is pedestrian, the characters are one dimensional, the story is obvious and uninvolving, and the dialogue, while often ludicrous and over the top, goes on and on without any point and without moving the plot (such as it is) forward. I read this book over a month because I found it so unbelievable and the writing tortuous. It's great that Mr. Hunter is published and selling books, but you have to wonder about the target audience: is this the type of book anyone wants to read? In a word, I thought it was an awful book."
2,Average,"I really enjoy Travis Hunter's writing and would go so far as to say that he's one of my favorite writers, so I went back to his older books to see how he started. I'm glad I started backwards because had I read this book first, I wouldn't have continued. It's not a bad book. Two friends, one a [...], the other one trying to make a difference in the black community, two brothers: the [...] from earlier and a crackhead, a sister who's disgusted with her own race and another sister with her head in the church. The book was so incredibly cliche. I wouldn't say it was a bad book, I've just read it a thousand times before and then turned on the t.v. to watch reruns of it."
1,Jerry Springer should be proud,There is absolutely nothing orignal in this book whatsoever. Looks like Mr. Hunter spent a weekend watching Jerry Springer and put every melodrama he could think of with wholely unbelieveable characters. Don't waste your money
3,RUN OF THE MILL,"I'd read ""The Hearts of Men"" so due to my previous exposure I was not in a big hurry to scoop up Mr. Hunter's second novel. After spotting it in paperback and purchasing, I realized that my initial hunch was right.The plot makes for semi-interesting reading. Mr. Hunter is indeed a talented storyteller. I noticed that I'd reached the halfway mark in the same day so he certainly keeps you engaged. But the subject matter is a yawn. Been there, done that.Mr. Hunter's social platform/agenda is weaved throughout the story as he touches on the plight of the youth and the black community through Genesis and his friend Prodigy's dialogue.The end result is a fast read, with VERY FEW highlights!"
4,A Land of Sheltered Promise,"This is a wonderful book centered around a place in North- central Oregon where the Rashneesee were, that covers three generations of people who lived there. The author always does a lot of reserch before she writes a book, using diaries and any information she can get and it makes the books come alive for the reader. It is a wonderful story of faith, endurance, and determination."
1,You'll have to be an artist to appreciate this.,"I purchased this video for my two young daughters (1-1/2, and 4) based on all the positive 5 star reviews I read, but unfortunately, I don't share the same enthusiasm for this video. If your kids grew up with Barney, Elmo, and Sesame Street, and Disney videos, this video is probably not for them. The animation is low budget, and there is nothing captivating about the video. No songs, no dance, no action...just dialog between the girl and the older man. Unless you appreciate art or know who Monet is, this is not the kind of video that you or your child would appreciate. This video is more educational than entertaining. Compared to all the other children's videos that my kids have seen, this one is downright boring."
5,We love it!,"We got the book first, which we love! Then we got the DVD, and we weren't disappointed. My 5-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son both love watching this short (30 minutes) movie. The only thing is that we want more! Maybe more interactive games on top of the ""quiz."" The garden sounds add up to the ""effect"" of a tranquil garden. Although the garden is anything but that (with so many tourists visiting!), the movie overall has a (pardon the cliche) calming---""feel-good"" effect."
2,A bit boring for today's generation.,"This video is full of great information, however, it is old. I found that my elementary students had a hard time being engaged by it. It starts out very slow, and my students had a hard time even giving it a chance from the get-go."
5,Recommended,"This is exactly the sort of DVD I wanted for my kids. No violence, no lowbrow humor, no hyperactive pacing, no obnoxiously noisy soundtrack that attempts to artificially excite the ADD generation of children. The artwork is beautiful, the soundtrack matches it perfectly, and the storyline isn't addicted to the usual tedium of marching the viewer through one predictable cliffhanger after another. This is a film of discovery rather than adversity. I rate this with as many stars as there are to give."
2,Interesting but incomplete,"This is a well-enough written book, mainly for intermediate astrologers and beyond. The content helps deepen a person's understanding of horoscope analysis beyond planets in houses and signs. However, due to editorial or author oversight, some of the sections are incomplete, and an inquiry to the author and editor have not been answered. It does expand on books such as the ""Only Way"" series which have this same kind of information in a more concise format, but still, one wishes that the art of editing were as rigorous as in former times."
1,know your industry,"This book was current in it's day, more than 30 years ago. But other than the guidelines for visual research, which is standard practice in Design school today, along with understanding how repeats work, save your money for a book that let's you design in Adobe Illustrator or Adobe Photoshop. It has a method of transferring parts of design using a rice paper that is hard to find today, and the industry is different with samples being printed on wide format inkjet before being put into production."
2,This X box Gamer got Ripped off!,"Well In my rush to buy a new X box game I purchased Artic Thunder without playing it first. What a Mistake. It's not a terrible game but the graphics are only so so and so was the game play. In my opinion it was simply ""rushed"" out to stores and will probably be one of x box's first reduced priced games in the near future. One word of advice on purchasing these expensive games for any system including GameCube and PS2: Rent them or try to play them before you buy them. I know everyone is guilty of buying games without trying them and when I popped this one in the Box I felt like I was ripped off almost instantly. It stinks that Software Producers actually put games like these out on the market for that price when they have to know that they are putting out a substandard product."
1,Arctic Thunder,no me sirvio por que el juego es de xbox solamente y mi consola es xbox 360 perdi mi dinero
1,STAY FAR AWAY!!!,"Sure,I liked Hydro Thunder on N64 but this is TO MUCH!!! I must say WaveRace:BlueStorm is a better buy on a better buy system!"
3,Will not work on XBOX 360,Overall a pretty good game considering the limited selection of snowmobiling titles available on any system. Unfortunately not backward compatible with xbox 360 as of 12/07.
2,Boring gameplay,I rented this game and was terribly disappointed. The gameplay in multiplayer was so blinding fast that you could hardly tell what you were doing. It was more like random shooting and there was nothing even vaguely fun and/or exciting about it. The single play was all right but the graphics are really lacking. The XBox is capable of so much more and this game really doesn't put the console to use at its full potential. I really couldn't recommend this game and wouldn't pay to rent it again.
2,Stay away from it!,"Choppy framerate, confusing graphics, sluggish controls, and it's well boring. This doesn't look like an XBox game at all... Do yourself a favor and stay away from this...thing. There are so many better games on XBox."
1,Tape eater,"When I first bought this cam it constantly ate the tape it came with. I brought it back to the store and they replaced the cam. Now 6 months later I have the same problem and the store tells me that my 3 month waranty is over. I explained them that the cam has the same problem as the first, but the answer remained,""your 3 months are over!!""."
1,Highly Disappointed!!,"I'm sure it's a good plot. However, it is cheapened by the frequent use of profanity: p.133 ""what the hell""; p. 144 ""dammit rick""; p. 170 ""that damn interview"" to name a few instances."
1,Limited use,"I just received the K&N Typhoon Air Intake Kit for my 2003 VW GTI Turbo. Looked through the instructions which stated the kit is only for use in good weather. If it rains, you are supposed to disconnect the filter from the extension tube and place the filter on the short tube in the engine compartment...not a simple operation. Apparently the long tube that puts the filter near the wheel well for cold air access also puts the filter in an area that will allow water to be sucked into the engine. Unbelievable. This is not mentioned in any of the advertisements for this product."
4,Fun Tricks !,"The tricks are cool, the controls are a blend of Tony Hawk and SSX.I wish they had better special effects, but the good gameplay overshadows the problems.I think the soundtrack is all right, but i turned it off after a while.Well worth the $ if you are into skiing or trick-based games."
1,I'd rather jump off a birdge,"Let me tell you a story about this being the worst game ever! The controls are just jacked up. It just doesn't feel right trying to do the big tricks. THPS made the tricks flow together, nothing like this game. Another thing, what were they thinking when they made levels in Las Vegas, and San fransisco. I mean if it was a real skiing game, why not make the levels at places where you can actually ski. Jackson Hole, Copper Mountain, Squaw, Mt, Mammoth, Wolf creek. ..."
5,Great,"A good buy, insane trick combos, such as a quad-back flip. The game is only muted by its hefty price tag, and llong deserted courses."
3,"The Bombay Boomerang (Hardy Boys, No 49)","I really enjoyed reading this book because the story makes you think about what is happening to the boys and figure out what is really happening. As you read the book, you discover many clues that you have to use to act like a detective and try to solve the mystery. You also have to figure out what the criminals are doing and planning. You really have to learn to think like a detective to solve the mystery."
2,Okay,Not much to say about this book. It was a good book. However compared to the rest of the Hardy Boys such it was sub average. I rate it a strong 2 star. Worth reading
2,Insulting,"The Hardy Boys are making a routine phone call to New York (area code 212). Accidentally, they dial the wrong area code...202, which is Washington. They hear something sinister on the other end of the line, which launches us into the heart of this ""mystery"". Out of the almost 10 MILLION possible phone numbers in area code 202, the Hardys just HAPPEN to call one which gets them crucial information regarding a case their Dad was ALREADY working on! Can you buy this outrageous premise long enough to enjoy this book? If so, there's no point in reading book reviews. You are so easily amused that you could have fun spending an evening watching a bug zapper. I gave this book two stars because of the comic value in how ridiculous the plot is. It's as if Ed Wood had decided to write juvenile mystery."
2,Below Average,"Mr. Hardy asks Frank And Joe to help him with his case concerning a gang that is stealing mercury. He asks them to call a shipping company in New York; however, a mistake with the area code causes them to reach the Pentagon, instead, just at the precise moment that a robbery occurs. These events lead Frank and Joe to Baltimore, where they attempt to track down the gang. The premise for this book is rather ridiculous considering that the area code for New York is 212 and that for Washington D.C. is 202. The 0 and the 1 are nowhere near each other on either a touch tone phone nor a rotary dial phone, so I don't see how a mistake like that could happen if you know the number you are calling. If your willing to accept this and just read the book, it's not that bad. The mystery is fairly well paced and there is quite a bit of action. The ending is somewhat silly, but mostly the book isn't that disappointing."
4,"Good book for hobbyist, but full of typos","Joe Carr has a very clear writing style and illustrates all concepts with simple circuits. His general approach is that of an electronics technologist educating a hobbyist or technician. He does a great job at this, but unfortunately devotes no effort to proof-reading. His books are flawed by numerous mismatches between text and schematics, improper symbols, etc. This will be very frustrating for the novice and obscures the points involved."
3,Lackluster performance,"I purchased this camcorder to replace an old Sony. After 1 DVD-R recording, I have decided to return it. The low-light performance was the killer. I used it to tape our child's first Christmas in normal, indoor lighting and it is very dark, almost unwatchable. The set-up was quite easy, but what good is easy set up if it takes poor videos? I am opting for the Sony 403 model."
3,Just OK,"When I first bought this vacuum, it seemed to work OK, at least on fairly light dirt. And it's quiet enough to run while the baby's sleeping. But after a year or so, even when it was fully charged, it had so little suction that it was pretty useless and I chucked it out. (That's even being fairly careful to run the charge down to nothing on occasion to avoid any memory effect, as well as cleaning the filter to try to improve air flow.) I thought the brush would add to the effectiveness, but it didn't, and it wore out pretty quickly. Seems to me the handheld ones do better on the small jobs for which this is intended."
3,Unhappy to complain...,"I bought one of these machines to be able to do a quick pick-up on the kitchen linoleum before I leave for work in the morning, without having to drag out the noisy ""big boy"" so early in the morning. I have 3 inside cats and 2 large dogs and the hair just keeps a-comin.'At first this little gadget was impressive...so much that I bought one for my son, as well...but it wasn't long before I noticed a radical drop in performance. I am diligent with keeping the cup empty and the filter rinsed and clean, but with time, each sweep of the Go-Vac resulted in a thin line of hair and dirt that just would NOT go away. I'd have to use a dustpan and brush to finish the job. This could be due to the dryness of the air, particularly during the winter months in Alaska, but it certainly made more work out of what should have been a snap. I have retired the little guy to the garage and begrudingly haul out the Wind Tunnel each morning."
3,Battery is Dead after 3 weeks,"I bought a bissell go and vac on May 15, 2002 and after 4 weeks of using this product the battery would not charge. I called the bissell company and they said I had to buy a new battery which cost almost as much as much as the vacumn. thank you"
5,My 10 year old loves this!,"This is a great little machine! I really like the option of the long handle, and it works great on hard wood floors as well as my oriental rug.No more crawling around on the floor with my dust buster to pick up those pesky crumbs! Actually, I don't get to use the Go Vac much because my 10 year old thinks it is so fun, she ends up using it at the slightest hint of a crumb!"
4,Barbie Vacuum,"For the most part, my daughter (age 2) used the vacuum for our playroom/extra bedroom. I supervised the plugging and unplugging for charging the vacuum and emptying the dirt from the vacuum. She loves to use it, and it is easy to use. My only complaint is the vacuum does not stay charged long enough."
5,Barbie Bissell,The Barbie Bissell was a birthday gift for my 5 year old and she loves it. This is easy to assemble and she was able to operate it without instructions and knew how to empty the canister.A plus for any child to keep thier room clean and play make believe.
1,After two weeks the battery fails,"Worked decently for two weeks. Pretty flimsy, but worked.Then the battery stops holding a charge and you get about 30 seconds of low power without any suction. What a waste.Now I can't return it to Amazon, so I have to track down Bissel.I would have rated it 0 stars."
1,homemaker not happy,"This vacuum works, for about 4 seconds. It won't pick up dust or hair after that, unless you empty the cup. There is a rubber band driving the motor, and easliy breaks - my husband has repaird it more than once. It is now sitting in my basement, waiting for the next yard sale! Biggest piece of junk I've ever wasted my money on."
5,Great little vacuum,"Finally, a kid vacuum that WORKS!!! My son and daughter used this all the time. I wish I could get another one."
2,Short-term use,"It worked great for the first 7-9 months, but now after 2 years the battery won't hold a charge and the suction is very light."
1,Don't buy this,It worked great for the first few months of use but now doesn't pick up very well or hold charge very long. I am sure there are better ones out there and I am looking for one again. This one was a complete waste of money.
3,impossible to clean,"I loved this little vacuum at first. It picked up everything from cheerios to dog fur. then after a few months it wasn't picking up so well, so I tried to clean it. You can't disassemble any of the parts to clean, so I tried to remove as much hair from the brush and wheels as I could with a razor. It just doesn't work as well anymore. I'm going to try another brand."
1,A Piece of Junk,"I was excited reading all the good reviews. Good concept, sounds like everything I want in a convenient vacuum. It was reasonably useful as described in the first couple of months, then gradually:1) the power just dwindles to next-to-nothing.2) Any hair that's over 4"" long gets caught on the brush & need to be manually pulled out or cut.3) Dust/hair (from previous house-cleaning chore) stuck on brush is spread over current carpet as it gets worked on, giving me more work than before I started.I don't even know if I would sell this in garage sale in good conscience.I'll stay with corded ones next time.I would have rated this as ""zero"" star if that choice wwere given."
2,Poor customer service--keep your receipt!,"We received this little vacuum 2 months ago as a wedding gift and loved it! It actually worked great, and we used it primarily in the kitchen to pick up crumbs, etc. The charge was strong enough to power several rooms (I believe it will run for only 12 minutes total). However, the brush no longer spins and it turns out that the rubber belt is worn. I called Bissell to ask them for a replacement under the 1 year warranty, but they said that it is not covered since it was a gift. I will certainly go try to purchase the part, but I am very dissapointed with the customer service, and the fact that it only lasted for 2 months.Buyer beware!"
3,cordless?,"What others miss, and the only significant drawback is that you cannot store it on its rechargable base -- unlike a dustbuster type machine. Company claims will kill battery. Therefore, you have to always make sure its charged otherwise it will be of no use."
5,Great little guy!!,"This is a GREAT little vaccum ... Awesome power for such a little guy. I have a house that has wood to tile to carpet and this little guy performs well on all three surfaces. And on the carpet, it leaves those little vaccum tracks like you'd see on bigger uprights ... is it going to be your primary vaccum? NO! can it be your ""in between"" vaccum or quick little pick me up or quick cleaning vaccum? FOR SURE!It sits neatly and upright in the corner in its charger waiting to get to work ... ZOOM ZOOM.This is a GREAT purchase! EVERYONE who has seen or used it (Mom included) has turned into a believer and asked me to get them one for Christmas or birthday!"
4,very convenient for small messes,This product is very handy for doing the stairs since it doesn't have a cord. I keep it in its charger and use it for messes where it is too inconvenient to bring out my full sized vac. Wouldn't recommend it for large areas since the battery doesn't last very long.
2,OK for a disposable vacuum,"This is the greatest little sweeper for about 6 to 8 months. Then the battery begins to weaken and won't hold a charge for more than a minute or two; and guess what: Bissell doesn't sell a replacement battery pack, nor can they tell you where to get one or even what type to get. Additionally, when I wrote the company regarding this problem, they offered to sell me another one, instead of trying to honor the warranty! If you can afford to replace it frequently, it is the handiest appliance you will own. If you want something reliable, the Go Vac is not for you!"
1,Not worth a penny...,"It seemed like a good idea when I bought it. With two dogs, and two parrots, the house gets dirty so quickly, and I hate using the heavy vacuum cleaner everyday. I didn't expect this to be as powerful, but I just wanted to sweep up small everyday mess like dirt and bird food on the floor and carpet. It worked ok, but it kicks off the dirt, and I ended up sweeping bigger area, and this thing clogs so easy. brush is so soft, end everything will be stuck on the brush. This sweeper is probably good for dusting, but not for small vacuuming work. I really hate using it now, I use old broom for my sweeping work. It's better than dealing with dirt spread everywhere and clogs."
1,Very disappointing,"After seeing the rave reviews on this product I just had to have it. Unfortunately, after a month or so the vacuum started to lose its ability to hold a charge for more than 5 minutes, had problems with hair sticking to the brush, but most importantly, doesn't suck anything up anymore even though I've cleaned out the filter and removed as much hair from the roller brush as I could. I am now looking for something more worthy of my time and money."
3,Bissell 3300 Go Vac Deluxe Cordless Sweeper,"Bought one of these products for myself and for my dad, neither of us are impressed with this sweeper! Short battery life and not good at sweeping the floor clean. Would expect better quality from Bissell!"
1,not worth it!,It worked great while it lasted...for all of two minutes! It worked well on the carpet in my apartment the first few times I used it. Now the little brush will only spin for one minute and then gives up! Definitely not worth it!
2,Good while it lasted...,I loved my GoVac when it worked fully charge. After about 5 minutes of cleaning it would start to bog down. After about 2 months of use it died on me. I believe it needs a new battery pack to help hold charge but that isn't offered in the parts replacement order form. A bit dissapointed in something that costs [price]!
2,you get what you pay for,"The first time I used this vaccuum I broke the handle. It broke as I was sweeping underneath the couch and it got caught under the cushion?? I can and do still use, but it is only for light touchups. I have a dog that sheds his own weight daily and we have all hard wood floors and I have to empty the debris out three times before I finish with the whole house. It's still better daily than lugging out a larger vaccuum. Considering the price, it's not a bad investment."
5,Dirt/Cat Buster,"I also found that this little gem picked up nearly everything except kitty litter. But I also found the little Bissell light enough to swing overhead gladiator fashion. After bludgeoning my cat to death, I threw it and the kitty litter out. Problem solved. I now plan to buy one of these for all my cat-loving friends"
2,A good start but fizles out fast,"I bought one of these but after only 6 months, it stopped picking up anythig bigger than dust and still threw lots of that around. The dirt catcher is very small also. For the first 6 months it worked great but it's just taking up space now and sucking power from the wall instead of dirt from the floor.Not recommended."
1,does not hold a substantial charge,This sweeper does not hold a substantial charge to clean more than one room. I am very dissatisfied with my purchase.
2,"Not enough power, battery life horrible.","It never worked for me. I know all about Ni-cads and memory, but this thing was just bad. Just basically pushing the dust around the room. Can't pick much up because of the lack of power."
3,Not as good as I remebered,"Its OK, for gringos, but not really inidcative of what good MPB could be, I I I I don't have any more to say"
5,This disc introduced me to Brazil,"What a great CD. I have all of Byrnes Brazilian discs and wish he would issue more. He really captured what makes Brazilian music great with his first three discs in this series. Still, this one is really special. The fourth and fifth disc in this series are dedicated to the artist Tom Ze who is brilliant in his own weird way. This first disc makes you just want to dance all over your living room. I wish Byrne would release more. Of course I now have a lot of the cds by the original artists, but this is the one that hooked me. Buy and enjoy."
4,A Strange Death Row Release,"Do not be fooled when you read the title of this cd. It may say: Snoop Doggy Dogg's Greatest Hits, but it also says ""Death Row's"" Snoop Doggy Dogg's Greatest hits. Snoop was only with Death Row long enough to make two records, Doggystyle, and Tha Doggfather. Back then, Snoop Dogg had more talent and was still called Snoop Doggy Dogg. This album did not need to be released. All of the good songs on this album are from Snoop's debut-Doggystyle. Death Row also put on a song from Dr. Dre's ""The Chronic"", ""Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang"". Another strange thing about this record is that more than half the songs are unreleased. There is only one song from Tha Doggfather. Nonetheless, all of the songs from ""Doggystyle"", make this a good cd. Pick up ""Doggystyle"" instead."
4,Back when Snoop was Rolling,hearing the early Jams Brings Back the early days when a Voice from the LBC Changed the Rap Game for a while.this here easily is Snoop's Best Album In Ages on a whole.Since the Death Row Days alot of Hit&Miss Material&for Me Snoop has been Riding on a Pop Pass.but when He&Dre Rocked the Mic Back in 92-93 it was something else.this is a Cool Overview.who knows what Snoops's Career may have been like if He were the Main Man on Death Row??but this Set Highlights what got Him Rolling for a while.His Flow&Voice were cool.
3,Okay. (My Name is O.I),"It was alright. Two of the unreleased songs were actually worth something. But it wasn't really needed. Mostly all of these tracks you an get on Death Row's Greatest hits! If you are thinking about getting this, or if you want to start listening to Snoop Music, get his earlier albums"
4,Okay for a snoop CD.,"This Cd is okay. I wish they would have included other songs like Loddi Doddi and Snoop's Upside Ya Head. The cooler tracks on this album are The Doggfather (Remix)-which I thought was better than original Doggfather, Eastside Party, Ain't No Fun, What's my Name, and my favorite song of all time Gin & Juice. This is a pretty good CD. If you want more of good Snoop checkout Doggystyle or Tha Last Meal."
3,should have stayed in the dogghouse,"suge did it again he says look forward to some more snoop dogg stuff, no one puts out more songs noone wants to hear like suge knight the kick is snoop ca'nt do a damn thing about it. spend your money on doggystyle instead."
3,Not Bad But Not Great,"On this album I like the following tracks - Nuthin But A G Thang, Head Doctor, Gin And Juice, Eastside Party, Murder Was The Case Remix, Ain't No Fun (If The Homies Can't Have None), Midnight Love, Who Am I (What's My Name), Doggy Dogg World and Vapors. All the famous songs on this album I like and they are great but the previously unreleased songs other than Midnight Love and Eastside Party are totally wack! Well I think so, either they have too many guest appearances or they are weird remixs that are no way near as good as the original versions. Its better to get Dead Man Walkin for the unreleased songs because those songs are much better or Tha Dogg if you want a best of album."
1,Who gets the Money?,"Does everyone realize that Snoop gets no money for this album. When Snoop left Suge, Death Row kept the rights to all his songs. This is just a way for Death Row to suck the last bit of money it can off its classic acts before the label crashes. Although the material on this album is absolutly top notch, maybe even the best that rap has to offer, I could not let Suge suck anymore off Snoop."
2,just get doggystyle,"greatest hits my a**! half the songs on her are unreleased, and there crap (except for ""midnight love"". thats a good song). no wonder there unreleased! snoop dogg must have been to asamed to put them on an album.all the good songs on her are off of ""DOGGYSTYLE"", except for ""Nuttin but a G Thang"", which is from Dr. Dre's ""The Chronic"". If you want classic Snoop Dogg, get the Chronic (snoops on like, 6 songs!) and Doggystyle. there worth every penny!this is just a cheep attempt for Death Row to make money after Snoop Dogg left there lable. don't buy this album."
3,The Spirit of This Covenant,"Overall, this is a wonderful fiction told story of the plight of women in southern christian churches.The author is knowledgable and sympathetic.I recommend this reading to all the women interested in doing our Lord's calling to the ministry."
1,so so brake,"You get what you pay for. The handles that pull the brake apron up do not lock down. I guess it does in a pinch, but not built for accuracy."
5,Great Book,"This is an errie book. It sent chills down my spine when I read it. --If you are interested in seeing these places, I discovered that Alton has a special tour of the homes in Taylor's book. It is a neat town to visit."
4,Interesting book.,"I am from the Alton area and have lived there most of my life. I thought this book was very entertaining and accurate as I know the owner of one of the buildings mentioned. I think it was a great way to learn about the city, and had very good information."
3,Another mediocre compilation disc,"Yet another in the long list of tolerable compilations which have sprung up over the last couple of years. Note that if you already own a couple compilations of Neo-Swing tunes, you've probably already got most of what's on here. I didn't pay much attention, and thought that I was ordering the full Speak Easy Spies album. Instead I got a disk filled with the same Bill Elliot, Lee Press-On, Acme Swing Co., New Morty Show, etc. tunes that fill every other similar disk out there. And the same Speak Easy Spies song (""Speak Real Low"") that caused me to look for their full album in the first place.None of these songs are great (with the exception of the groovin' ""Speak Real Low"" & maybe ""Boozin' and a Cruzin'"" by Dem Brooklyn Bums), but none are really BAD either. A wishy-washy disc gets a wishy-washy review. :)"
2,BADLY OUTDATED!,"Originally written back in the 1960's, the defusing methods outlined in this book re no longer in use. This book was written during the ""hippie heydays"" and was all the bomb cops had back then. While this book is a good historical reference, a bomb investigator could well spend his $54.00 much more wisely. Not recommended."
5,This book is awsome,"ya know some people just like to blow up stuff.. their not gonna go and blow up people. i just get a kick out of watching something blow up because of something i did, like a toy soldier or something. not a school. most people who buy this book are like me, and are going to do something like what i just said for pure fun."
1,astonishing,i cannot believe this is even a book? this is appalling that someone could actually purchase a book like this....it is no wonder there is some much disaster in our world....this is the reason....i will not return to this site!
4,Good but..,"The quality of the book is excellent. I'm not sure what was the selection process, but in my opinion, the best and most popular images of the magnum photographers are not on this book. Never the less, this book presents an outstanding compilation of pictures full of strength and beauty, displaying the inhuman conditions of humanity from all the corners of the world."
5,Rational arguments against the global economy,"It's a shame a book like this is needed at all. We should have thought about this before we implemented our global economic system. Caught in an ever smaller web, countries are forced to compete for scarce resources, which are not the products of countries, but corporations. National sovereignties are destroyed. The environment is affected, since our economy judges our ""goods"" for value, rather than taking into account the environmental or emotional worth of something. Things become commodities and are prepackaged and sold back to us. For what? The question is something we should have asked before we allowed things to get this far."
3,Great season....BUT.....,"I enjoyed this season however I am a bit miffed that season 8 released by Amazon does NOT contain ""Previously On The Amazing Race"" recaps before each episode. Each episode begins with the opening credits and no recap is shown on any episode.While many of you may not care about this, we are not getting the full show as shown on TV.Had the season contained the recap of the previous episode, I would have rated this a 5-star.PS Season 9 also does not have the recap prior to each episode.Boo Amazon! I would have expected more."
4,Good,"Verbatim makes great DVDs so the quality of your burn is always solid. The lightscribe is ok. The contrast could be better, but I have the feeling that it is what it is. I don't know if other companies make a better quality lightscribe DVD. It's still better than hand-writing the lables, that's for sure."
4,Verbatim DVD+R 4.7GB LightScribe 30pk Spindle,"Have only used a couple of these disks, but so far expectations are being fulfilled."
4,Good Pick,"Excellent graphics and no complaints on my order, they also arrived early which is always great."
1,DVDs won't burn,"Just bought these Verbatim Lightscribe DVD's on sale (5-10-12)and haven't burnt a successful one yet...maybe that's why they were on sale?? ($14.99 for 30). Tried eight so far using different burners, different burning programs, speeds, format, cleaned burners, etc. - if it burns, it can't be read on any other reader. Been burning CD/DVD's for years with many different manufactures including Verbatim (and supposedly inferior products) and never had this many problems - must be a bad lot?? Also bought some Verbatim Lightscribe CD's on sale and haven't tried those, hopefully those will burn. Will update then."
2,Spotty at best,I have been using Verbatim Lightscribe disk for about a year with no problems at all. Unfortunatly that is not the case with this batch. Every disk fails when burning to them unless I burn at 4X speed or slower. When at 4X I only had about a 50% fail rate. I had purchased a total of 60 disk and had over 40 fail.
1,First 10 bad,I ordered these in October 2008 by mistake.I just tried to use them; the first 10 were defective. The drives burnt a second box of 30 without a problem.Steve
2,40% useful is not good enough to buy again,"I burn many dvd's of our church video's so I've tried several different brands and styles. I have bought these dvd's before and normally in a 30 pack I have 2 or 3 disk that won't burn. However, this last pack I bought - thus far only 2 out of 5 have worked. Sorry to say I guess I won't be buying any more of these from Amazon."
3,Try LabelFlash,If you ever use LabelFlash you will never use LightScribe again. LabelFlash is very professional looking and the printing really stands out. The down side is that you may have to buy a new computer with the LabelFlash burner.
5,It' fun to use!,"This product is excellent. In fact, I would burn the whole pack of these disks just for fun, that's how I love to do it! I just cannot stop! I made a DVD disk with photo slide-show for my parents as a present and created very cool label with 5 different pictures and text on it. My parents could not believe me, that I made it by myself.You can get a lot of ideas for label designs on the Internet or create your own style. The software is free for download and fun to use. The quality of the disks are also very good."
4,lightscribe disc,"copied ok but the lightscribe print was very light,could not really make the words out at all, so if you need a clear crisp image this will not due"
5,fun dvd+r pack,These disks are great! They work fine and are pretty colorful. I got them because of there color selection and that they are lightscribe discs. They work as expected and are fun colorful discs to have around. Now I can share some bowling videos with my friends on a colorful DVD. Shazam!
4,Verbtaim Spindle,"For my purpose, I wish they sell one color per 25 disc vs. 5 different colors in the spindle. Overall, I been using them for a while and they do exactly what they supposed to do."
5,Great product,"Not a single issue with these disks. They are amazing, I use them for my photography business and they add something to the finished product and boutique packaging that other photographers here haven't stumbled on yet. I feel as though this gives me a creative finger print, and I really enjoy it. No issues writing to the disks, data or lightscribe. Excellent product."
4,Fine Product,I have had no problems with Verbatim DVD's. They have always performed well and I've not had any duds that I have had to throw out.
2,didnt work in DVD player,"Isn't the purpose of burning DVD's is so that you can play them in a DVD player??? I tried the discs in several different players, even a blue ray player, and it didn't work in any of them. They worked on my computer just fine though. Also, I didn't think the images on the disc showed up very well. Overall I'm pretty disappointed."
5,Great product for a great deal.,"Bought the product and it shipped fast. Fits great, looks great and functions great. The product is a little fragile but can be done with care and patience. Also is the best price around. I am highly satisfied, but remember the words care and patience."
4,Leaves Me Tingling,"Sex is easy. Sex as art is a little harder. Art that evokes sexual energy is harder still. Berlin is the master of the art. I am aware of no other rock band that leaves the listener so sexually charged. 4Play proves that Terri Nunn and Berlin have not lost their edge. This is a good example of their work. The live performance of ""No More Words"" compares favorably with the studio version on LOVE LIFE. Still, if I had to choose only one Berlin album, it would be their seminal PLEASURE VICTIM."
2,what????,"after the masterpiece that was ""voyuer"", i am very dissapointed in this. i have loved every single album from berlin. what sets berlin apart from other bands is, of course, terri nunn and her gorgeous vocals. she is, hands down, the best female singer since debbie harry. all i can say is that berlin is a band that doesnt need to be covering any one else's songs. they create beautiful songs of their own. i just hope we dont have to wait years for a new studio album. they were on the right track with voyeuer, their last album. this collection of songs is mediocore at best. hearing them sung in concert at a berlin show is one thing,and quite enjoyable, but on record they do nothing for berlin. sorry guys."
2,Terri Nunn karaoke session?,"Alright, so Terri Nunn has picked out a band of pretty boys, but can they rock? Somewhat. It's not a terrible album. But it's not a particularly inspired covers album, either.The best track is probally The Dope Show. The grinding guitar/synth sound seems to be what the new band is moving toward. None of the covers deviate much from the original recordings. I expected a bit more from new versions of very well known songs. Well, a bit more than adding ""my a** getting bigger, my chest getting bigger"" to Big Time.There are two new songs thrown in. They aren't too bad. The first, Scream, sounds a bit like Concrete Blonde gone electronic. Gothic, slow and sexy. The second, Down and Dirty, has a bit more blips in it, more like early Depeche Mode.I hope that with this out of their system, the band puts out a dark, electronic album worthy of the brand name."
5,Tingley overshoe,Thanks for a great product. These overshoes stretch easily over my shoes and keep them dry. I work part-time at a golf course where I have to wash the carts when they come in. These overshoes slip on and off easily and keep my feet and shoes dry.
3,Men's Stretch Overshoes,"I made a mistake ordering these overshoes. I wear an extra-wide shoe and these are medium width. Consequently, I am unable to get them on. I thought the 2XL meant they were wide enough, but I miscalculated. They are long enough and I thought I could stretch them enough to get them on, but I couldn't.I will likely gift them to a family member rather than return them."
2,Tigley Overshoes,"The item is described as fitting a shoe size 9.5 - 11 U.S. Mens. However my foot is a size 9, and I tried to get this overshoe to stretch over my size 9 tennis shoe and it would not stretch far enough."
5,Just what I needed.,"I have to go to various homes for my work and I needed some overshoes to cover my walking shoes. (I don't wear dress shoes !) Most brands, like Totes, are designed for dress shoes and squeezed the heck out of my wide + comfortable walking shoes. These work great for my black walking shoes !"
4,It's a mirror,"I bough this to replace the one I ripped off my car backing into the garage one dark and rainy night. Was relatively simple to install, matches right up perfectly. Only bad thing I can say is that my old mirror was kind of glossy, smooth finish.... This one was 'exactly' the same finish, the finish was similar to the texture on the keys on my keyboard. Other than that no complaints here."
2,disappointed,"I went for the less expensive sharpening kit and got what I paid for. Within the first minute of sharpening the chain in the woods, the Oregon file bent where it enters the wooden handle. I was barely putting any pressure on it. I own numerous files for many different uses, and a file that sharpens a chain saw blade should not bend so easily. Period."
1,Mafia an Expose,Phew! Save your money. This thing is awful! I gave [..] for the whole set and I regret it! It is poorly done. Horrible audio. Not recommended!
3,Not bad,"Mafia: An Expose' is a good way to find out more about the Mafia, La Cosa Nostra & organized crime in general. (If this is the boxed set, and not just the Al Capone DVD.) For the people really interested in the History of the Mafia, this is a must! (I say again, as long as this is the boxed set of 5 DVD's.) Even my wife liked this set. Good history. If you don't like history or can't deal with films that are not big production, this is not for you."
1,Starts out okay...,...but then gets repetitive and boring. These DVDs feel as though they were made by amateurs. The commentary gets old quickly and there isn't much of anything new to be learnt. I never got to the end of the last DVD so I can't tell if it gets better as you near the end.
1,This set should sleep with the fishes...,"Brutal. And I thought Blair Witch Project was the ultimate in nauseum through poor production. There is some decent content in a few of these programs but the production and sound quality are so incredibly bad you'll grow disinterested quickly. During the piece on the Kennedy's involvement with the Mafia, they show the famous clip of the assassination and just as Kennedy is about to get shot, they block out his face (like they do on real life cop shows to protect the identity of the people involved) and insert a re-created scene and then back to more block out footage. Throw in the garbled Jimi Hendrixx music and it just doesn't get any worse. If your used to the slick production of A&E produced Mafia programs, you'll be extremely dissapointed. Don't waste your time. Throw in your worn copy of Goodfellas or the Godfather trilogy and enjoy!"
1,x-box stinks,i love this game for ps2 and when it comes out for gc but i mean cmon the controls stink. x box is the worst system eva. thats it.
4,We'll have to see,"First off, I have to say that NFL Blitz for the N64 was my 2nd fagvorite game for the system(next to Goldeneye) and was incredible fun, especially with two players. Back then, I never thought of what a football game should include, like the ability to have a dynasty, trade players, and create new players. It didn't matter that it didn't have any of those features because it was just so fun to play. On the other hand, I have only played the GBA version of Blitz 2002, ... I wouldn't preorder Blitz 2002 for any system until one version has come out for either of the three main consoles, then check the reviesws and see what they have to say."
3,2002 doesnt live up to its Legacy,"I am a die hard fan of the NFL Blitz series. Which is y i rushed out and bout NHL and NFL Blitz on their release dates. Agfter seeing the Hitz i feel like all Blitz fans got ripped off. In Hitz u had new team logos could create a player, create a team , new stadiums such as ""shark tank"" and the ""moon base"" that u could buy and a challenge mode to help improve certain skillz. NFL Blitz has none of that. That aint it tho. I cant even find a way to create a playbook anymore. I think Midway got so into Hitz they blew off NFL Blitz and tried to make the inauguaral NHL Hitz awesome and they did. I must say tho the coaching mode is interesting. Graphics r good. If u want a game with no rules get Hitz its a true show of Midways awesome legacy as a dominate game company. They reall ydisappointed me with NFL Blitz this year."
2,Needed shims,I bought this plate along with a Bench Dog cast iron router table wing. I had to shim the plate upwards to get it even with the table. That should not be necessary seeing how both are offered by the same company.
3,Who would buy this for a kid?,Unlike the McFarlane stuff this is an action figure meant to be played with.Raw design wise it works well. But I would never give a child anything dressed like she is to play with.Not to mention Spawn was more or less an adult comic book.
3,Entertaining play,"This play is quite entertaining, short,and written so that you really get to know the characters. The only surprise was the ending....very similar to one of the Shakespeare's."
1,WTH,"What is this? Rimbaud or Wilde? Amazon, you need to hire Kindle editors. Put some unemployed English majors to work. Disgraceful."
1,"the others in this series are quite good, THIS ONE ISN'T","1. The woman who sings the songs has a lovely voice, but poor enunciation for a beginner's ear (unlike the other ""teach me"" recordings).2. The are no translations for the vast majority of the materials, so be ready to spend a lot of time figuring it out yourself.3. When there are (supposedly) other children on the recording, the voices, including the male children's voices, are faked by the same woman (or maybe with the help of another woman). It's pretty cheesy.4. There is a LOT of talking without translation. The stories are nice, but unless your already proficient, skip it. As I said, there's no translation, you're on your own, and your children will be asking you ""where's the singing?"""
5,Truly captures a great prog rock band.,"Great videos! This band never got the fame they deserved. Both concerts in this video are outstanding. And the addition of Mel Collins in the second show is outstanding. If you are looking for the best footage capturing Andrew, Peter and the boys, you just found it."
5,What a wonderful album this is.,"I have felt this album wonderful. Title ""First Light"" is best! It was good to buy this. 1977's member is best. Andrew Latimer, Peter Bardens, Andy Ward, Richard Sinclair, Mel Collins. They have talent to handle various wind instruments. The bass guitar sound jumping up and down which Richard Sinclair plays is an impression."
5,Great cake topper,"I bought this set to put on top of my 13 year old's birthday cake! It'll make his day! Maybe I'll carve a hole into the cake and place the hatch opening on top of it! :) I'll have ""Make your own kind of music"" streaming nearby ....."
2,Bad Writing,"On a visit to NYC I ran across the author in Harlem selling his book. I decided to purchase it. Mr. Johnson has certainly put together a creative tale but his writing leaves MUCH to be desired. I'm having a difficult time getting through Part I because the writing style is just...awful! It's almost as if the author isn't using an editor; as if he's just writing, flipping the middle finger to a rewrite and just putting the book out there. There are so many gaps in the text; I found a few misspellings, etc, etc. Regardless of how good the book might be, I can't see beyond the bad writing and lack of editing. I'm going to TRY HARD to continue reading these two books simply because I paid for them. But Isadore Johnson really needs to consider investing in an editor for all upcoming book projects."
3,Sólo punto de partida,"Esta compilación puede considerarse como un punto de partida, pero no el mejor, ni el más representativo. Este disco está enfocado al mundo angloparlante, por lo que las canciones que contiene dan cuenta más de la música cubana que de las líricas de Silvio, las que la mayoría de las veces van acompañadas unicamente de guitarra acústicas y con ritmos sencillos.Sin embargo es una buena forma de acercar a quienes no hablan nuestro idioma al increíble universo musical de Rodríguez. Además la edición es muy buena, y contiene las letras en ambas lenguas y con una biografía del trovador."
1,"""Silvio Light""","I have to agree wholeheartedly with the review of this CD by Antonio Rioseco. This CD is for marketing Silvio to the gringo. It has the 'de rigueur' revolutionary songs like "" Cancion urgente para Nicaragua"" & ""Playa Giron"" but it is far from the essence of this singer/songwriter. I suggest exploring his triptychs (Triptico 1, 2, 3 and Silvio, Rodriguez and Dominguez). My favorites are the second ones in each series (Triptico 2 y Rodriguez) which include some of his best poems put to music. I love ""Llover sobre mojado"" & ""El tiempo esta a favor de los pequenos"" and Rodriguez's ""Casiopea"". So don't go for the Silvio Light go for something more filling."
2,Don't buy this one,"Cuban ""trova"" music has suffered a lot because of the compilations. They tend to reduce the music to ""hits"". And this compilation represents that manipulation (I dont care if it comes from Byrne or whatever) for Silvio Rodriguez music. If you want to really enjoy Rodriguez begin by his old albums (Al final de este viaje, Unicornio, Mujeres, etc). You can follow to the 80s big albums (especially ""Triptico""), and then probably you will like to try the 90s solo work (""Silvio"", ""Rodriguez"", ""Dominguez"") Trova is not about hits. Get the albums. Dont by this one, you will loose your money."
5,Great french songs from the sixties,"Desormais is an original great album from Aznavour,not a compilation,and you can hear the songs in the same order you did it in 1969!"
4,Bass,"Being a young musician, and not knowing very much about playing bass, this program was very usefull to me. I was pretty much looking for something that would allow me to plug my bass into my computer for recording purposes but I also learned a lot from the lessons. A great buy."
1,Yuk!,I would not recommend this CD. I found it to be really cheezy!I was expecting words by Eckhart (in his voice) The female voice emphasizes every word in a sickening new age tone. The music is electronic and irritating! To sum it up....yuk. I couldn't even get through it once.
1,very disappointing!,"I agree with another reviewer -- the high-strung ""music"" is very distracting and set my nerves on edge.(This was supposed to be relaxing?) I was expecting some soothing and ethereal music which would go with Tolle's affirmations. But in order to really hear the affirmations, one must turn the volume up so loud that the music hurts the ears. What a disappointment! Recommend you listen to excerpts before you buy. (I made the mistake of not doing this.)"
2,Music inappropriate,"The music for these wonderful affirmations is so loud and a fast beat it is difficult to even hear the speaker. A nice flute playing softly (or anything slow and soft) would have been much better. I played ""..The Thinker..."" one as a pre-meditation for my Yoga class and it was anything BUT pre-meditation. I might just make my own CD for private use ... same words, but nicer BACKGROUND music."
5,great cd,"What a great CD. I read ""The Power of Now"" and this CD really helps to keep the message of the book alive for me. Sometimes I just listen to the music and sometimes I ""tune in"" more to the words. Very cool idea."
1,miserable book,"This book is absolutely miserable. It is not even written for Wildfire 2.0. It was written for the older version of pro-engineer and some scam artist decided to keep the profit wagon rolling by selling it as a wildfire 2.0 book. If you buy the book when you use it you will find it is full of incorrect and incomplete instructions. They have added the update since I bought the book and maybe this has gone through the book and made the necessary changes, but if an ""update"" means they tacked some clarifying notes to the end of the book then the book is just as miserable as it was when I bought it. Don't get scammed stay away from this book."
2,Timing,"I needed the book as soon as possible, reason why I choose next day shipping, and amazon made a mistake and didn't send me the book, just some brochure. Good customer service, since they sended me the book, the next day. Even though a little bit too late."
5,Best pre-shave product you can get,"I've tried The Gentleman's Refinery pre-shave oil (TGR makes an outstanding but pricey shaving cream), but it pales in comparison to Truefitt & Hill's Ultimate Comfort pre-shave oil--- a great smelling product that really sets your beard up for a super shave. If you have sensitive skin, this will help eliminate nicks & razor burn and (because it smells and feels so great) you will actually look forward to/enjoy shaving in the morning- seriously!"
4,"Great product, but expensive","After getting back into wet shaving with a double edged razor, I find the total shaving experience has improved. Slowing down a little bit, enjoying the process of a luxurious lather produced from a fine shaving cream and badger brush - just creates a better start to the day. This product is not strictly necessary if you take the proper care in moisturizing your face prior to application of the lather. However, if in a rush, the shaving oil helps the prep process quite a bit. I recommend the product for this purpose, but it is expensive. Of course, it doesn't take much... a few drops is sufficient, so the small bottle will last quite a while."
1,"Expensive, ineffective","I purchased a pre shaving oil in the hopes that it would reduce minor nicks and cuts when used with the 'traditional' soap lather. I purchased this Truefitt and Hill shaving oil after having good experience with their shaving soap.In general, the oil was ineffective I didn't perceive any noticeable differences in my shave when using it. The oil smells okay - like cheap citrus. It's also very thin. I believe they did this on purpose so it does not clog up a razor blade. However, I think a more substantial cushion of oil would have provided a much more comfortable shave.For a more comfortable shave, I've had better results with Jack Black Beard Lube. It's an all-in-one shaving solution that slicks the face very well for a razor, but does not provide the luxurious lather of a traditional wet shave routine. If you don't want to give up the lather (as I do), you're better off skipping this oil and spending the extra money on good soap."
3,not quite as described,"ordered this after looking around. the colors seemed to be clear, blue and orange.i received a pink card with no case. sealed, new package, but no case. being a guy, had i known it would be pink, i would have ordered a different brand.i checked the local game stores, all had the same sku, all just in pink.be aware that you are likely to get pink with no case."
5,idea for previous reviewer,To more easily move your mixer buy a tempered glass tray at walmart. Put sliders underneath it. Put mixer on tray and it will easily move in and out from underneath your cabinets.
2,tough to clean,"I use this every day. I would give it a higher rating for its quality of motor, speed and mixability. But somehow a liquid shake blend got inbetween the base of the blender (the black part) and the glass and it is 100% impossible to clean. I cannot take it apart. It has grown gross and black and I am tempted to throw it away but then I wouldnt have a blender! argh. now it is out of stock.... hmnnn"
3,It's a blender that goes on a Mixer,"I have the DSM7 and it came with this blender for free. I have only used this blender a few times, mostly because it requires pulling the mixer out (from under the cabinet), taking off the plate, emptying the bowl, and then putting the blender on it. After you get all that stuff done it seems to be a decent blender. It has a nice glass jar, and all the power of the mixer powering it.The bottom line is that if I didn't get it free with my mixer I would have never bought it. It seems like a lot of money for what basically is just a glass blender jar, that you may never use because it is a hassle to do. Then again if you got this for a deal, and your mixer is an easily accessible place, it may work out for you. It didn't for me, so it lost a few stars."
2,"Disappointing ""remote""","We purchased this toy for our 3 year old son as a reward in potty training. He had worked toward it for weeks. He already has a large Rescue Hero collection, including the Aqua Command Center & airplane. We like all of these toys. The URV robot does not really do anything but walk a little bit, talk & activate the Voice Tech dolls, which it can also identify by name. The remote is attached by a short cord & barely works, and the robot is very clunky and unresponsive. We don't have the Powermax figures so I cannot comment on that feature. It also shuts down if not used for a relatively short time, and is then hard to restart. For fifty bucks, I would expect more! This toy does not deliver value. My son has had it for 3 weeks and already does not play with it. Save your money!"
3,Over priced but ok,"Bought this toy for my son - given by Santa. The first one had a problem with the winch hand. The claw would not stay in the arm. I was able to find a replacement with a claw that did stay in. However, the claw does not shoot out as it should. The string never releases so you really have to yank on it. On the other hand, the URV can drive over the carpet and does work pretty well. Recognizes the VT figures by name and besides the winch functions well....this thing should have a wireless remote. It is a bit of a shame that they are selling something that is crippled with a tethered remote. ...Would I get it again? No. My son has much more fun with the figures than with this thing."
1,Never Worked!,"We bought one of these for my son. Luckily, my husband decided to open the box and get it ready for Christmas morning. After several tries to get the remote activated, we could never get it to start. On Christmas Eve, we bought another one. It also did not work. My husband went to Toys R Us and took batteries and tried another. It also did not work. I read the reviews here mentioning the problems with operation, so we opted not to get another. Such a disappointment, since my son would have absolutely loved it. However, I am glad to have found out about its problems before my son saw it under the Christmas Tree."
1,Batteries are in. Nothing happens. One Depressed Child.,"This is the toy my grandson dreamed of - and received for Christmas. When we put the batteries in and turned it on - NOTHING HAPPENED. We verifed that the batteries (all five of them) were installed correctly and turned on the power switch again. Still no action from the robot.Is anyone else having this problem? Hopefully, when we replace the toy tomorrow - the new one will work and provide the enjoyment that was expected.Lesson learned - always test your toys before Christmas day!"
3,Average book,"I was hoping for a book with a little more detail. This book is very vague. I am not too sure who this book would help. It isnt detailed enough for a beginner, but it is probably too generic for someone who is advanced."
5,Strangely appealing album,"Jimi Hendrix / War Heroes: One of the early posthumous albums, this CD is strangely appealing and is so unique that it remains relevant in Hendrix history. However, it is NOT worth $70! You shouldn't have to pay more than $25 for this, at the most."
1,Amazon is shipping bootlegs....,"This product, sold by Amazon, is produced by MaxCat not Atlantic. It's a cdr and contains no bonus track nor album art nor booklet. Totally surprised that Amazom put this out there. Amazon should at least put the right info on the product page."
3,Shame on Amazon,"I too bought this CD directly from Amazon, thinking there is no way they would send me a bootleg, and sure enough, not the evocative cover, but some blue insert (no doubt from some copy machine) version with the words, and inside, yep a CD-ROM R.I have the album, I could play all of the songs by 13, so I thought it would be nice to revisit it on CD, and I thought there is no way they are going to send me some bootleg copy. I use Amazon a lot, and I value quality and integrity.So for Music content, I like it, not earth shattering, he was a good performer, and hey, you have to admit, nothing says sexy like Push Push, but Shame on Amazon. I could have gotten an Italian or Denmark version for like 3.99, or I could have copied my own version to CD. Knocknig down a star for Amazon's shotty handling and contribution to ripping off the Mann estate."
5,Great Slow Jazz,Have appreciated this album since it was released 'way back. He has a style that is unique and listenable.Give it a go!
2,"Great music, HORRIBLE CD. Poor quality, no liner","Music is absolutely great. But it sounds like a cheap copy. Music quality is horrible, even considering it was recorded in 1971. CD has no liner notes, no nothing, and the cover is just script that says Herbie Mann, Push Push. Not even the proper album cover (not that I really wanted to see it, but still). Wish there were a better way to get obscure music, this was a very diappointing experience through Amazon."
3,"When Push, Push comes to Shove","Following Herbie's ""Underground"" LP on Atlantic, Push, Push was highly anticipated. When it came out it was along the same lines as his last, and was neither a failure or a commercial success. After that in the late 60's/ 70's the feel for Jazz blues, feel off as well as his sales."
2,So So,"The late Herbie Mann was neither a great composer nor innovator in the field of jazz music. He was, however, a talented musician and in listening to this disc, you can gain an appreciation of his abilities--and weaknesses! Overall, this isn't a bad disc but the choice of material and lackluster arrangements make for a rather uninspired listening experience. If I could, I'd give this CD 2 1/2 stars.Here's my assessment of the tracks on this album:BEST: What's Going On, Man's Hope, and Never Can Say GoodbyeAVERAGE: If and Funky NassauWORST: Push Push, Spirit in the Dark, and What I'd Say"
2,not worth the money,Did not ever work right. Was hard to manage - couldn't use the handle really at all. I'm sure there are better options out there for the money.
2,Very poor product support,"We purchased this unit in March, 2003 (with a one year warranty). Suddenly, in December, it stopped working. Since, we have been back and forth to the Sanyo appointed service agent three times, spoke to Sanyo respresentatives on the phone numerous times, and the unit is still with the service shop. It does not seem that the problem is fixable! Sanyo's support has been quite bad. They have not returned phone calls as promised; have not follow-up even though they promised to; and the service shop seems to be clueless!Update: 3/04. Sanyo has since sent us a new unit."
1,Just broke today,It stopped working 6 months after the warranty ran out. According to Sanyo will cost more to fix than I paid. While it lasted it worked fine.
2,Stopped working after 1yr,The top half of the option panel stopped working after 1yr of very light use. 2 stars because it still looks nice as a large clock.
3,"Ok product, just fit in my kichen","Ok product, doens't give me too many supprise, too much noisy almost made to return it. However, it is just fit into my kichen and it is stainless steel, maybe I shouldn't expect more."
2,Flawed,"This story is a monumental one in its scope, and Ball did take a good crack at it. What annoys me is he seems to have dropped the ball in some areas, Hall's relationship with Dame Margaret Rutherford being one(mentioned, then largely ignored). The conclusions reached at the end are just flawed. Anyone who has ever tried to get a copy of their birth certificate knows you cannot obtain one in a state you were not born in. It seems like he started out with a lot of good intentions, but like some of Hall's writing, the story just fizzles and reaches ""a"" conclusion."
2,"Not the next ""Midnight in the Garden og Good and Evil""","Ah, the south, how we love our eccentrics! Dawn Langley Simmons wasbeyond eccentric. Way, way beyond. Reading Edward Ball's Peninsula of Lies kept me thoroughly confused, much like most of the people who knew Dawn while she was alive. Confused, perplexed and more than a bit frustrated. Sadly, Miss Dawn was not alive to aid the author, so he relies on friends, papers author is able to talk to the deceased husband, is the picture pulled into clear focus(sad it takes an interview with a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic to bring clarity to this mess). I put this book down with mixed feelings....exasperation for all the messes Dawn got herself in and sadness that she felt compelled to go to such lengths."
2,Blecch!,"A tired, repetitive & bitchy book about a fascinating subject. How unfortunate that this writer was the one to get to this story first."
2,Time not well spent,"The subject matter was interesting, but the story could have been told as a short story. It went on and on and on with way too much useless information. I could have done better things with my time."
3,Art of Noise CD,I gave this CD 3 stars because the song I wanted to hear was nice and long. Moments of love relaxex me before going to bed at night.
2,1994 is centuries ago in internet time.,"This book is too long and too old. It goes though tto much unnecessary math. It spends a lot of time on minor details, while avoiding some of the real issues - how to design a modern EDFA. Im mathematically inclined, so the math was not bad, but if you're pictorially inclined this is not the book for you."
1,not very useful,I had high hopes for this book and tried to work with it for a long while (especially given the high price). However it is much too difficult to understand and does not explain things clearly. It is very confusing to follow and it seems like the author's mind was jumping around a lot in many of the chapters.
1,good news / bad news,**good news** would be a useful up to date EDFA book **bad news** (especially for the serious EDFA designer and researcher) Emmanuel Desurvire is attempting to write it. Will some one else please write this book? The above book is two flawed to be twinned on library shelves.
4,Tintanabulous!,"This story is about one of the many Caesars that were on this earth. This story tells about how hard it is to rule the great country of Italy. How all kinds of people try to kill you. This story is an incredible story about how a young man that became Caesar of Italy and took over all of the land that was full of blood thirsty Gauls.Caesar is in his 40's in this epic and isn't harsh or cruel. He is kind to his people and still strong enough to govern Italy.This story is an amazing epic about how someone who took down the Gaul army. This book is a MUST READ for anyone who likes ancient Rome, and action! Personally I love this book and hope you do too!Chase Laine"
5,Great Study Guide!,"I had mixed expectations for this book based on the reviews I read here and other places about this book. I purchased this book and the Principles of Helicopter Flight book and used both to study. The practice test in this was a life saver! I scored a 143 out of a possible 176 on the AFAST and finished all sections of the test with time to spare. Do the practice test over and over and over and do it for time. I made flash cards for the complex movements section and that helped alot as well. Overall this was a great purchase and I would reccomend it to anyone taking the AFAST in the future.Do not use this as your only source of reference! Study on flight principles as well, because the questions are not straight out of the test. If you do not study, you will not even know what some of the questions are asking for!Highly Reccomend!! AAA+"
4,Used book to Pass Army Flight Test,"I was surprised that this book was ""on it"" when it came to the test questions that they ask you. I can't speak how well it is when it comes to the other branch tests, but it helped me prepare for the test giving me a passing score.One draw back of the book as far as helicopter knowledge it really fails to cover the basics for someone knowing nothing about helicopters. I suggest getting a book that explains the basics for beginners.Another thing to point out if you don't mind ebooks you can view this book for free on the army warrant officer website. The whole book is PDF format."
2,for AFOQT buy Barron's not ARCO,"I took the AFOQT in Feb 2008, if you only buy one study guide, by Barron's. The ARCO does not reflect the current 12 section test, Barron's does. Also Barron's gives you 2 practice exams, ARCO only one. The ARCO book is fine if you want another practice exam, but you need only work on the sections that are included in Barron's."
1,ASTB Section Review,"I purchased the Arco Military Flight Aptitude Tests text for the sole purpose of preparing for the ASTB. This book was less than helpful. The section devoted to the ASTB had test sections that did not exist on the actual test and was missing a section that did exist on the actual test. Some of the questions were similar, but overall the practice guide that Arco provides will not help very many people. I was not pleased with my purchase. It should be noted that my review only covers one section of the text purchased and in no way represents the entire book...however I will not purchase another Arco text for the rest of my life if I can avoid it."
2,Errors and Ambiguousity.,"I swear. There must be at least 10 visible errors on the AFOQT chapter itself. For example, there is typo on page 140 on problem number 13. Check for yourself...it's a definite typo. On page 210, problem number 7, there is a mistake...the right answer isn't even an option...Also, on the AFOQT section, the pictures of the planes on page 191 to 200 are very bad in which it's hard to tell if your looking at the bottom or the top of the plane. The other errors may be the ambiguousity of the questions presented. The book, on the brighter side, definitely covers what will be on the test...but don't rely too much on the answers it gives you."
3,Ripped Off!!!!,"The seller of this item is a liar and a thief, I have never in my life been so disappointed with amazon in my life. How can they allow people to list books for 3 times what they are worth. The back cover of this book clearly states $24.99 and I was charged $80+, since I couldn't find this book in most book stores I looked to amazon who I thought I could trust, I guess not. Well thanks amazon for allowing this business to go on. I will never purchase anything off your site again."
4,Its not going to teach you what you don't know,"Use this book for the test format. Do the practice tests in ""test"" conditions. Good luck."
2,Many errors,I purchased this book to help review for the Army AFAST test. The price was around $80 and that for a book in used but very good condition. I have no idea why the price was so high as on the back cover was printed a price of around $27. But $80 was the going rate everywhere I checked for used. New was much higher. So for that money you get a book that explains the test well but in the practice test section the answers given are incorrect 25% of the time. I found that to be unacceptable.
4,Great Help,"This book really helped, but I am sure the tens of reviews before mine already assured you of this fact."
2,Not sure what they fit,"This product was purchased to replace labels on an Olde Thompson spice rack I purchased but didn't match the ones in the rack I bought. Not sure why they wouldn't have either universal labels, or at least make ones for the rack I bought. I returned both items as I was less than satisfied."
1,doesn't fit spice bottles,Bought this to label top of spice bottles (olde Thompson) and they don't fit. I was ticked. Waste of money.
5,Love these!,"Had pretty much all I wanted and they include blanks. Very nice looking! Also very forgiving! If you put them on a little crooked, you get a few chances to get them right. The adhesive is strong once you get it right."
5,Worked well,"I decided to organize and alphabetize my spice drawer. These stickers worked perfectly. They did have a couple of duplicates (which I thought unnecessary) but since blanks were included, that sufficed for the spices I still needed. Since I use an array of spices in my kitchen, I didn't find any of the stickers included to go unused."
4,very good,the labels are ok they did not match as good as we thought they would but they still look ok and they stay on.
5,Excellent!,"This item was sold at a discount becuase it was new, but damaged. The damage was slight and the condition was excellent! The description of the item on the purchase page was right on, but the actual damage was significantly less than I anticipated. I am very happy with my purchase."
5,But you can't dance to it...,"If I had to describe amazon.com in two words, ""fabulous deals"" would do it; Joni Mitchell in two words requires hyphenated words count as one word, or I'll take my toys and go home! ""Dynamite-lyrics"" would be one word, and ""haunting-melodies"" the other! (Just don't ask me to rate her paintings -- to each of us his own.) It's grand to get this long-owned album in ""new and improved format,"" and especially with my vinyl in ""hating-it"" condition, just ""played to death."" ""Greatest hits"" on this album include ""Big Yellow Taxi"" and ""Woodstock."" (""Morning Morgantown,"" because I said so! Once you know it, just try to pry this melody out of your head, then you'll know why I do!)"
5,A CLASSIC,I bought this when I was in High School on vinyl. I ordered the CD just recently and really love it all over again. It has stood the test of time. Truly a classic ofrom my generation.
5,HIghly Recommended,I consider this to be Joni Michell's best work. Songs such as Willy and Blue Boy have a poignant melancholy that is unmatched. I enjoy the 'solo' work on her first three CDs the best of all her work. She is a wonderful song writer and intimate performer. And Ladies of the Canyon is my personal favorite.
3,Pure practice,"Competent enough to highlight several elements that would forever make her unique, this still reads like a luke-warm up to the quantum artistic shift that became the follow through."
5,A must hear,"After hearing this song on Democracy Now I was really intrigued so searched on You Tube for Rim Banna. Several songs from this cd are on so decided to buy the cd. A really beautiful work. Sarah is a real, soul wrenching, tear jerker. Especially when you see the video and understand that it's about a 16 month old girl shot by an Israeli sniper. It will definitly help you understand and feel what the Palestinian people are going through. I played it for my neighbor who is right wing, country music, truck driver and he was crying!!"
1,Dont bother!,"I thought this would work, but it destroyed my hard drive. Norton thought I had a virus on my hard drive, and my PC is 2 days old! I had to call hp, and order reformatting disks to get my pc back up and running. leave this one be, or you'll be sorry you used it."
2,SMALL,A lot smaller than I was expecting. Apparently I need to pay attention to detail. Something my Mother had tried to teach me for years. Sorry Mom!
5,A penetrating look at the knowledge-organization connection.,"Taking an organic systems view, the author explores how organizations acquire, manage, and transfer knowledge. Covers: the nature, role and order of knowledge; best practices; types of organizational structures that support knowledge sharing; technologies for knowledge building; developing knowledge strategies; and efforts to measure results. An very impressive gathering and integration of ideas about organization in the Knowledge Era. A first-rate book on a cutting-edge subject."
3,"Good, yes, it's good","The DeLonghi A930 hasn't got the depth, width, or strain to hole size ratio of the KitchenAid StrainMaster 2003, but it comes a very close second, and at this kind of price, you're not really going to know the difference. I strained pasta, I strained green beans, I strained broccoli, hell, I even strained my wrist pulling the damn thing out of the box, but it still gave me maximum performance time after time after time. If you want your veg straining, you don't need to look any further than this, unless of course, money's no object, in which case I'd go for the KitchenAid model. Mind you, at one cent off, you can't really say no to this bargain!"
3,Four Comedies...,"a worthwhile read for anyone. but look into it if your taking a college course on roman comedy especially though. it's not a quick read but a good one. the ""brothers Menaechmus"" stays the truest to roman comedy forn with the five staple characters all in there. not for those wiht short attention spans."
4,"Not the best, but an okay leisure read.","After reading this book, I felt like I just watched a mediocre action movie. The book is an easy and interesting read, but some disconnects and unnecessary sub-plots and characters. I didn't really understand why they were in there. I felt the author was in a rush to finish the book and didn't take the time to develop the main plot fully enough, and went on some unnecessary side plots. Anyway, the book is not the best and not the worse either. Just okay; get it from the library, don't purchase a copy. By the way, I also thought the book was incorrectly titled. I was expecting something different...an assassin doing assassin type work, not a ""CIA"" agent, doing CIA type work."
5,Simply Delightful,This is a book with such entertaining pictures. I peeked inside the book and what I read really was touching. I would buy this and read it to my child if I had one to read too. However this book would warm any child's heart.
5,Perfect for an Only Child,"This book is fantastic no matter what, but especially if you have an only child. It teaches a wonderful lesson about feeling good about being in the situation you are in. It is also a fun book to read...our son loves the different animals and their sounds and behaviors. We have read and re-read this one many, many times. We all love it!"
5,THE TIGHTEST GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I THINK THIS GAME IS THE COOLEST!!!! I ALREADY HAD TONY HAWK 2X,BUT I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD GAME. IT's THE BEST THPS OUT THERE>"
3,LOOKS GREAT! plays weak.,"Okay, so graphically this blows THPS2x out of the water. But you need more than that.The controls are so tight, and a little TOO realistic. Remember in 2x when you did your first 1080, and you got SO excited? That's how you feel the first time you land your 540s successfully, here.If you're used to 2x, you have to expect a WHOLE new game. If you missed 2x, then you'll blow away everyone who didn't."
5,THE BEST TONY HAWK GAME THERE EVER WILL BE!!!,"Tony Hawk 1 was a classic, I wish they would make it for Xbox....But Tony Hawk 3 is the best. I have played this game over and over and never get tired of it. You do everything on a skateboard on 3, unlike Underground which I dont care much for. The career levels are great with different scenery everytime. Over all this game is a must have for any gamer or skater...."
2,Should be Great,"After buying 2x this game should be awesome.Look at em' bust the moves.and then look at the park editor!But if you like games with more fun, maybe you'd like to take a look into EA's SSX Tricky,which i also have first hand expeirience with, and it's alot more fun then this silly little excuse for a game.That game should be Number #1!Tony Hawk focuses to much on realisticness. compare NHl Hitz 2002 to NHL 2002, NHL 2002 is more realistic but not as fun!"
3,The Copy Box,"I am a PS2 owner, but have one freind who has an XBox. I have Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3 for PS2, and I recently played it for XBOX. On PS2 it gets a deffinite five stars, and on XBOX a 3. Why? The game is alsmost the EXCACT same. XBOX gets a 2. Why? The games that come out are 98% of the time COPOUTS of PS2 games.Can Bill Gates and his billion dollar industry come up with some friggin originality? No body wants to play the same game after it came out 6 months ago on the PS2! You XBOX people are boring and unoriginal. Get a life and stop copying for God's sake, and the video game world's sake. P.S. There is one game franchise that happens to be the #1 game franchise you can never touch. Grand Theft Auto III, and other Grand Theft Auto games that come out (The next one comes out in October)"
2,Great Game/Lousy Controller,Feel sorry for anyone trying to pull off high scoring combos with the X-Box controller. Expect to throw your controller frequently.
5,Can this game get any better?,"This game is another great outing in the THPS series. I have no complaints about any of the levels and the interaction on this game is great, I realy liked the Suburbia and the Los Angeles, I won't say what I liked about these levels, since I don't want to spoil any of the surprises. I do have to agree that pulling combos is far easier with the playstation controller, the xbox is a great system but the controller needs to be reworked. I had problems using the controller on Dave Mirra 2 also. The angles on the controller are terrible, are you pushing up or down or diagonal??? Final note, I wouldn't trade my Xbox for anything currently out there."
4,Decent CD.,"I think the CD is worth a buy for others. The Swingtips sound the best to me on the CD. Blue Plate Special O.K. Kind of a wacky name for a swing compilation since very little of the music has to do with ""Ballroom"" dancing."
4,Short and Sweet,"Seelye's short work, travels through a considerable amount of major works and authors, including Poe, Stowe, Chopin, and George Washington Cable among others. He describes many of the antipathies with which these authors regard New England cicles of thought (including Poe's distaste for the Transcendentalism of Emerson and Thoreau), arguing a reactionary position for Southern authors. He concludes that Southern literature is not original but rather an extension of New England and other American literary models. The work is useful for quickly surveying some regional literature; however, invoking such literary milestones and treating them rather briefly, leaves a certain ""something"" wanting that a fuller arguement might provide."
5,The dogs are hilarious!,"My 16 month old son loves this video, and I don't mind watching it over and over with him. He giggles hysterically at the dogs wearing hats. It was recommended by someone and we're getting another copy as a gift for a two year old that watched it and kept asking to see the puppies again."
5,Entertaining and educational!,"Our 3 year-old son received this as a gift for his last birthday, and it has been a huge hit for the whole family. William Wegman's dogs have always had a special place in our hearts since we, too, have a weimaraner. It really is a riot to watch the dogs mixing soup while eating the ingredients right out of the pot. And I love how it also teaches ABC's without losing it's entertainment value! We highly recommend this video - it's a must-see for any age!"
2,"Didn't work, but company was great about their return policy.","I followed all instructions, but it was just like painting water onto the jewelry...didn't do anything to the metal. I do appreciate how great the company was about giving my money back."
1,Horrible Product,"This is not worth the money at all. This is the 2nd Carafe I have bought for this over priced coffee pot. Only to have it break again, after bearly banging it against the coffee machine. Buy a different brand!"
2,"Easily broken, and I'm not a spazz","I switched to a Krups after my third break on this carafe, just from putting it in the dishwasher. My Krups carafe has taken a few dings without a problem. I'm now done with Braun - for good - since the replacement is expensive and it's just a carafe, for pete's sake. Who is Pete, anyway?"
5,Highly Recommend,"This is another great Sesame Street video. Nice messaging, catchy songs and great match for our sports loving household. It was one of the earliest ways my now three year old son and my husband began bonding over sports."
3,Just ok.,I have purchased several Sesame Street videos over the past year. Our favorite is Bert and Erine Play on Word DVD because it is full of music skits and does not contain any scenes with people( my son prefers just watching the puppets). This video does not come close to be as entertaining. This video is still cute and my son will watch it but it does not capture his attention like the Play on Word DVD.
5,I Love Jay Hernandez!,"Crazy/Beautiful was the best movie that I have seen in a year! I love the blue tint that the movie had to it. Kirsten Dunst was so ragged in the movie, but so believable. Jay Hernandez played his character perfectly! The storyline was one that all teens can relate to. I just saw it last Friday and I definitley will go see it again. I will also have to buy it on VHS when it comes out!"
1,Worst movie to date!!!!,"I just love a good interracial movie. This movie played the race card, which any good IR movie will do... but the also played the Teens-gotta-have-sex-all-of-the-time card. It also played the Gotta-get-high-&-drunk and outcasts-are-the-coolest-people card. I would rather get one pap smear per hour for the rest of my life than watch this movie one more time!!! The only thing the main character did was act like a freaking baby and the male lead, to say he was so smart, was so stupid. He felt he had to clean up all of her messes and in effect almost screwed up his own future. Her father repeatedly tells him that she will (but he won't listen). I waited throughout this entire movie for it to get good..... and it did... in the last 10 seconds. Don't waste your time or money on this one, unless you just loved the movie When a Man loves a Woman (which I also hate)!"
2,"This movie could've been BEAUTIFUL, but it's just CRAZY!","""Thumbs Down!""What people seem to miss about this movie, is that the plot is so usual, 'Foreign man and American woman who fall in love but are the complete opposites and the public rejects their relationship', that you don't even need to watch the movie to know what happens. I've seen Save the Last Dance, which basically has the same plot. 'He's black, and she's white, they fall in love, and the public rejects their relationship.'..."
1,AWFUL!,This is by far the worst movie i have ever seen in my life. It is boring and stupid. I wish i could give it less than one star. Kirsten Dunst plays some so of crazy lady that is always getting in trouble and taking pictures. Nothing really big happens. I have never prayed harder for the credits in my life. DONT SEE THIS MOVIE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! Thanks for reading my non biased review of this film.
5,"Not crazy at all, but rather beautiful","I happened to know the director and while at his house, I had seen the ""dailies"" (which are the scenes that they have most recently edited), and I wasn't too sure about it. When I finally saw it put all together, it was great! There was only one scene I didn't like (Carlos' brother telling him that the weight of the world is on him). Also, could you see any other young actress playing Nicole, the messed-up over-privelaged druggie? Dunst's preformance was brilliant. The cinematography was beautiful. The story was smooth and completly relatable. What more could you ask for?"
3,make it a 3.5,"It's hard for me to rate this movie. For as slow as the movie was during it (I fell asleep two different times), towards the end-it ended quickly (IMO, not a good thing). With that being said and regardless of how slow the movie was, it gave a great messageSo-should one give it a 3 for the slowness and quick ending movie? Not to mention the story line itself wasn't anything we haven't seen before (just flip the roles). Or should I give it a 4 for the message?In the end, is this a run out and rent/buy movie? nah. And if you do, I suggest people to rent it first and than decide. I didn't mind spending the money to rent it, but I find it to slow to purchase it and/or watch it again."
2,Ok film but could have been better,"Crazy/Beautiful could have been a great film but director John Stockwell was forced to cut it to please those at Disney. The film originally called for nude scenes for the character of Nicole and a more explict sex scene between Nicole and Carlos. The film could have been a true to life about interacial dating, drug problems etc but it's too resolved in the end. The only things that saves this film are the performances of Jay Hernadez and Kristen Dunst and John Stockwell visual flair for L.A."
3,Classic,"Crazy/Beautiful is as good as: (I am not comparing, just rating quality here) American Beauty, Braveheart, Terminator 2, Men In Black, or The Matrix. That does not mean it is LIKE these movies or that it is a combination thereof, only that quality and satisfaction of experience is as good as those movies. It makes you WANT to see it again (especially if some stupid kids were chatting behind you and would NOT shut up)."
5,Crazy/Beautiful,It is pretty awesome and you were right.. It was shipp to my placelike in 3 days.!! cool!
5,For once a teen movie that means something,"Crazy/Beautiful is probably the best teen drama I have seen in a while.When I rented this I had expected another fluffy teen drama.Lets just say I was expecting another Here On Earth.But I rented it anyway because I am a huge Kirsten Dunst fan and I had heard only good things about this movie.When I sat down and watched it I was very surprised.The movie actually had real characters and not some characters thought up in ten minutes.The movies plot might no be a whole lot different from the plot of some of the other movies,but this one you can tell was thought in more than 15 minutes.Jay Hernandaz delivers an awesome breakthrough performance.I hope to see more of him in years to come.Kirsten Dunst hands in,probably,her best performance to date.Give this movie a try.Even if you don't like it,it's worth seeing the two actors do an amazing job"
2,typically unrealistic and predictable,"I walked out after 34 grueling minutes. Hmm, another movie with the white rich female and the romantic lower class hispanic male. Would someone please save ME??? My advice: save your pennies and wait for video release. Then when one of your friends rents it, go over and see it for free."
4,Close to reality,"I enjoyed the movie. I have met people like this. Kristen needs to take a shower in the movie though...a little too much bad language. Overall, teaches a lesson"
5,Great Soundtrack,"Well, not really. But Osker is on the soundtrack, and I hear they make an appearance in the movie, I haven't actually seen it myself."
4,Nice movie,"This is a pretty decent movie as far as this genre goes. It's a fairly typical poor kid falls in love with rich kid movie with the usual difficulties such a relationship would bring. It seems a bit stereotypical to have the rich kid be an unfocused wild child and the poor kid be a highly focused and driven person looking to move up in life, but that doesn't detract from the movie enough to ruin it. There are a few risque scenes and some suggestive language, but it's not too bad. The characters are fairly likable and the actors do a fairly decent job with them."
3,Refreshing and light hearted.,"I did not really know what to expect when I went to see it. But based on that, I did get my money's worth back. Just a light hearted romance (rich girl, poor boy) movie with a parellel story of the complexities and upbringing of the 2 characters from different economic backgrounds. But all in all, still a lay back, relax and watch kinda movie with some look into personal issues that young people deal with.Kirsten Dunst gets a big thumbs up!! Looking forward to some more good acting from her. Casting was done well. I liked the fact that the director decided not to have subtitles for lines spoken by the mexican-origin characters in the movie."
3,teen viewers will enjoy this movie more than adults,"Not a bad movie, not a great movie. It's hard to put an original face on the same old plot of star-crossed lovers. Still, the acting and direction on the film is very well done. Dunst is a convincing as a mixed up California Congressman's daughter. As I watched, I both emphasized with her character and hated her for bringing her love interest (the handsome Hernandez) to near destruction. I think teen viewers will enjoy this movie more than the older adult population. Nice moral behind the movie too."
3,More Beautiful than Crazy,"Let me just say that I cried through most of this movie. Mainly because I saw it right after I broke up with my bf who looks remarkably like Jay Hernandez. That aside, I really liked the movie. You want them to be happy with each other, you want Nicole to make ammends with her dad and step mom, and you want her to lay off the smack and comb her hair. But Carlos is the hottie with his eyes on the prize. He's got aspirations, and that's a great quality. Yes, it's very West Side Story/Save the last dance/Romeo&Juliet etc. But that theme's been hot for hundreds of years. It still works."
1,If you liked this tripe you must be DEAD,"This was the standard rerun plot of all teeny bopper movies. It was not original or imaginative. An Ms Dunst needs to wash her HAIR it was disgusting. Even after a shower it is greasy!Do not waste your money, I had to write this review to bring down the rating average, it is not a 4 star movie!"
2,I tried to like it...but,"There turned out to be very little of interest in this formula teen flick. It tries too hard to be a serious examination of the two leads' lives, but it doesn't dig deep enough. Kirsten Dunst saves it from a 1 star rating, because she is radiant and with performances like this one she'll go far. But don't pay money to see this."
2,Melo-Drama at Best,"It's hard to say just what went wrong with Crazy/Beautiful. Perhaps it's the static characters, the plot without any peaks or the simple fact that it's impossible to empathize with another rich, white girl. Personally, I expected more from Kirsten. Aside from the fact that she resembles a boy throughout the film, she lacks the personality needed to pull off a character with so many emotional problems. The plot was simple. Boy meets girl. Girl and boy have sex. Boy and girl face challenges. A monkey could have written better."
3,Not so good,"The film was about a wealthy but yet depressed teen, Nicole(Kirsten Dunst). She is neglected by her father and frowned upon by her step-mother. While serving her community service hours for driving drunk, she meets a not-so-wealthy but kind and smart teen, Carlos (Jay Hernandez). Carlos and Nicole spend a lot of time together and fall madly inlove. Nicole has never been happier, but soon things take a turn for the worse. Carlos is doing badly in school because he is distracted by Nicole, while Nicole is getting more depressed because her father won't let Carlos see her anymore. It takes a while for this movie to take off, but the acting is pretty good. I just didn't find this movie all that entertaining, but maybe someone who likes emotional teen movies will."
3,Not what expected,"I bought this DVD (big mistake) before I saw it. It was a good movie, but only the kind you can watch one time and then be done with. I am a fan of Kirsten Dunst and thought that since all her other movies were ones you could watch over and over, this one was no different. Her hair looked so greasy and cut as if it was ran over by a lawn mower. Maybe I can get a good price for it at our next yard sale."
2,An average teenage romp,"OKay, first off. I am a 16 year old girl who generally does not enjoy going to see films indented to entice the ""youth of America"", nevertheless, I went to see Crazy/Beautiful. I almost walked out within the first half hour. It was such an overgenerlzation of teenagers and basically told today's youth that sex is meaningless and doesn't need to be safe.On the postive side, the film did a great job of showing the different lifesytles of teenagers and how it can effect two people's feeling for one another and those around them. Kristen Dunst's acting was very, very good and she remains one of the very few younger actors that I can stand. She gained my respect when she was 11 for her role in Interview with the Vampire.Overall, this film is not overally special. It's not an epic. It's actually rather dull and overdone, but for the few moments were the film really shines, it's worth it to sit though the lesser scenes."
4,A Diamond in the Rough,"I caught this film the other day on Romance Classic's sneak preview on AMC. I don't ususally watch any of the Romance Classics, but being a Roger Moore fan, it grabbed my attention. I really enjoyed it. Great performances all around, and especially by Moore. I never thought that he was capable of such a subtle performance. A beautiful film just to look at the landscape. A great ""slow"" film. Obviously, you cannot buy it, but definitely rent it if you can. It's perfect for those rainy days when you just want to stay in."
4,Bed & Breakfast,This is a very entertaining film-with atalented cast at the top oftheir form. Recommended for those who want intelligent films.
5,The ultimate companion to Devil in the White City,"This book would be the ultimate companion to Erik Larson's Devil in the White City. Each page shows one large black and white photo from the Exposition with a one-paragraph description below.The ""World's Columbian Exposition"" of 1893 is also known as the ""Chicago World's Fair"" (there have been two - one in 1893, which is the subject of Larson's book, and one in 1933.)Some idea of the subjects covered can be understood from the title page: ""...COMPRISING ITS MARVELOUS ARCHITECTURAL, SCULPTURAL, ARTISTIC, MECHANICAL, AGRICULTURAL, INDUSTRIAL, ARCHAEOLOGICAL, ETHNOLOGICAL, HISTORICAL AND SCENIC ATTRACTIONS --- also presenting and describing The Magnificent Vistas, Water-Ways, Natural Scenery and Landscape Effects -- ALL CONVEYING AUTHENTIC REALISTIC IMPRESSIONS AS RECEIVED BY THE ACTUAL VISITOR"""
1,"Looks nice, probably leaks...Horrid Assembly!","1. This is a 2 to 3 person job.2. The directions and diagrams are poorly written and drawn3. Despite the floor being square and level (we checked multiple times) the predrilled holes don't all align.4. It took about 20 hours including building a wood floor of 2X4 and 3/4"" plywood.5. If you don't heed these reviews and do buy the shed DON'T BUY THE METAL FLOORING KIT! It is a useless add on.(Mine is sitting by the the side of the road waiting for the recyclers to pick it up)6. Buy 2 metal drill bits to make the inevitable add on holes that you will need to make7. Buy extra weather proofing tape and use caulk as you assemble8. In terms of helpers, choose either someone you hate and wish to torture, or someone who loves you and will forgive you for your moronic decision to start ""a little project.""9. Most important advice...DON'T BUY THIS SHED!"
1,Never Again,"After 3 afternoons, the shed is finally up. Directions are somewhat vague and the images in the directions leave something to be desired. In the end, its a decent shed, but I'll never buy another metal shed because of this one. I'm a pretty mechanically inclined person with lots of building experience. I thought it would take an afternoon...not 3. I could have built an entire wooden shed (and better built), complete with floor and stronger roof in half a day, all while keeping my sanity (and weekly schedule) in tact. For the mechanically inclined...go ahead and go for it if you're dead set on metal sheds. Average homeowners....I'd stay away from it."
2,Small!,"Clearly I should have read the description a bit more thoroughly; I was expecting a large zafu cushion only to find that this one is less than a forearm's length long. It seems good quality and sturdy, though definitely not worth the $25 for the product + shipping. I've learned my lesson."
3,I expected a different book.,"This is a great book!I expected to read about the water cycle -- clouds - precipitation - evaporation...This book explores a lot of information: the source of water on our planet (smashing planetoids and comets), how water becomes a gas (including things your child may personally observe about evaporation: coming out of the pool, puddles disappearing, breathing, sweating), how plants use water and produce water vapor, condensation, cloud formation, rain/snow/hail/freezing rain, several pages on why water should not be wasted, and concludes with this message: Be thankful for rain, don't grumble, because water is a gift from the sky.The illustrations are very well done. If you are a homeschooling parent, this could be useful in your curriculum -- I think the reading level would be good at 2nd or 3rd grade. There is a glossary page and a page of fun facts.I'm having trouble getting beyond the last line of the book: ""Rain is a gift from the sky."""
3,"Age of Nemesis: Psychogeist (2006) - 3,1 stars","Age of Nemesis hails from Hungary; not a country known to be a hotbed for progressive music.Musically, they play prog metal; with major inspirations from Dream Theaters early recordings, especially the guitar has a similar sound to the crunchier riffs found on DT's Awake album. In addition to that, several songs are spiced with elements that seem to originate from jazz and fusion.The musicianship is good, the individual members give each other space to contribute individually as well as being good at supporting each other.What I found wanting on this release were really good songs. Apart from the tracks ""Mommy's Crying"" and ""Abraxas"" most of the songs here just aren't very interesting.Competent prog metal well performed by good musicians."
2,Not Very Durable,"These brushes were a disappointment and are not very durable. The adhesive which holds the brush together came apart the first time we used them so the handle is not secure. The bristles are not very soft, and tend to fall out easily. If you are planning on using your brushes often, you may want to consider a different set."
3,Not what I expected,I was really looking forward to reading this book after I lost my only child. I have to say that I was a bit disappointed at the negativity portrayed in this book. I am trying to get to a point where I can live my life as a tribute to my son and this book didn't seem to help with that mission.
5,Best book on the subject that I've read,"Candid and compellingI am also a bereaved mother. These nine women have bared their most innermost feelings in this honest and powerful book. It is the best book I have read, (and reread), on this subject. I highly recommend it to not only to all bereaved parents, but family, friends and professionals who care enough to acquire some insight into what life is really like after losing a child. They have bravely shared their hearts and bared their souls in order to give others hope."
3,Guide for surviving the death of your child,"Surprisingly enough, this book didn't do it for me after I lost my second child. I DO recommend it for bereaved parents and professionals working with them, because it 's a very personal thing. I just got more from ones written first person by bereaved parents than I did from the ""case studies"" of a professional, however well-intentioned. Of the 16 parental grief books I read, I only kept six. The rest I donated to my Compassionate Friends chapter."
4,genuine and honest accounts from bereaved parents,"A very good friend lost her daughter and I was looking for a way to relate to her grief.I found this book, ""beyond tears:living after losing a child"", very informative and helpful in understanding what my friend is going through. The mothers and their families recount how they felt, acted and responded to their world after losing a child. It is very poignant,heart-felt and surprisingly honest. I would recommend this book to anyone who has lost a child or someone who wants to understand how a parent feels after such a loss."
4,Things your friends don't say,"Only a grieving parent can speak to another, after the loss of a child - for no one knows the depths to which one sinks - and this book does let you know that there are others out there and that you are not alone in feeling this will never end - and that it will always be with you, but you will be prepared for your despair....But wait at least a year before you read it..."
4,Not going crazy,"This book has been a tremendous affirmation of my sanity in grief when friends are expecting a grieving parent to ""get over it."" There is no ""getting over it.""It helps to know that my continued sadness in response to losing my daughter is not abnormal, but rather a natural grieving process. The reality is that grief is not a choice, that life will never be the same, that there will always be reminders of the life that could have been. The challenge for parents who have lost a child is to continue to live with tears that are never far from the surface."
5,Courage!,"Beyond Tears is extraordinarily moving--and sad. Well written, but a difficult read because the stories are so emotion-filled and the tragedy is overwhelming.Muster your courage and get this book, it is a work of pure commitment and passion. Love is on every page. Congratulations to the authors!"
2,A Bit Depressing,"I lost my 28 year old daughter in a car crash May 2005 and have read numerous books on grief since then. Among those I found most helpful were ""The Worst Loss"", ""A Grief Disguised"", ""When the Bough Breaks"", and ""Holding on to Hope"". Some of the moms who wrote this book were Christian, some were Jewish, but none seemed to hold to Biblical teachings during their time of loss. Psychics!? How does that square with the teachings of either religion? In some ways I found it difficult to identify with these authors. I did find some insights in some of their comments but overall cannot recommend this book"
3,the book on palo,"This book had a small number of inconsistencies. The description should have noted that the rituals, siglos, etc. pertained to the Kimbisa branch of Palo and did not include any information rgarding Bryumba Kongo or the other roads of Palo."
4,"Ok, slightly off","I bought this book without having read anything from the author before. I have to say that books on subjects like this are generally filled with a lot of misinformation. This book is a bit better than the rest. Baba Raul Carizares has presented a work filled with information about Palo Monte. He makes the distinction however that Palo Monte and Palo Mayombe are like light and dark. I had to disagree with that distinction, neither is light nor dark. All in all this is a pretty good work. I recocmend this one over the others on the subject."
2,interesting indeed,"This book is an interesting read - for anyone who is not initiated into Palo Mayombe or Quimbanda! It represents Raul Canizares' OWN INTERPRETATION of these traditions and represents Palo and Kimbanda - yet again - as being ""dark and mysterious""! To hyped-up for my taste! If you are interested in Palo, find a good Tata and study with him or stick with Lydia Cabrera's books. For anyone interested in the Brazilian Qimbanda/Kimbanda tradition, have a look at NA GIRA DO EXU by Mario dos Ventos"
5,krumkake iron,This product is easy to use and easy to clean The electric component makes it much easier to make a consistent cookie because of the even temperature. We would recomment this product to anyone who enjoys Krumkake.
3,Toujours Moi for Women review,This product was rather a disappointment. I will use it but the fragranceis heavier than I would have liked.
3,quick read regency,"Basically the storyline is that Daphne comes to town to visit her aunt, who has a scandalous past, and to pass the time they decide to write her memoirs. When the ton finds out, they begin paying old debts to the aunt to prevent any of their personal stories making it to press. The Duke St. Felix is determined to stop these women from leaking his family's scandals, but finds that he is mistaken in both Daphne and her aunt.I enjoyed reading this book, but I felt that the main romance storyline took a back seat to the secondary characters and anecdotes from the regency period of the time. It wasn't bad, I just wish that the interaction between the hero and heroine was developed a bit more. It felt to me that he just decides one day that he's in love with her without showing us really any reason why. But I think the portrayal of the regency time period is very accurate."
5,Superb introduction to the philosophy of mathematics!,"In this introductory level text Prof. Shapiro has presented a thorough introduction to the philosophy of mathematics. Not only does he discuss the three most fundamental positions in the field, but he also provides insight into more recent developments. I would highly suggest this work to anyone interested in having a solid understanding of this issues at stake in the philosophy of mathematics. Along with Paul Benacerraf and Hillary Putnam's book of philosophy of mathematics readings this is a must have!"
5,Excellent,An excellent book that I recommend to readers interested on mathematical philosophy who are not specialists. A nice difference with other books covering the topic is that no term is considered known so the reader does not have to be accompanied with a philosophy encyclopedia. Needless to say that concepts and ideas are clearly exposed. Congratulations to Prof. Shapiro.
1,Commandos 2: Men of Courage,"This has to be the worst game i have ever played. the graphics are not good at all. When first starting out, u cann't even see the player, plus its very difficult to move/learn the different cotrols for each different character. Do not buy this game, i garentee that it will be one of the worst games that u will ever play on the xbox, or any game system!"
1,cammandos stink,Absolutely impossible to play. This game is way too complicated. There must be a hundred combination of buttons to remember to get things done. Some men can only do certain things and have to remember who can carry a gernade and who can't. Who can set a trap and who can't. Then try to rember which combination of buttons to push to make the man plant the bomb. After twenty minutes of set up time the enemy attacks but it happens so fast you can't move any of your men around in response to the attack. If you lose even one of your men the games over. The game becomes very frustrating and becomes very boring very quickly. This game STINKSThe Keeper of the Sleeper
1,Unhappy Camper,Just got this game a day ago and am already looking to sell it. This is by far the most complicated game I have ever played due to the controls. The game does have a wonderful tutorial for learning the controls that from start to finish is only about an hour long. EIDOS should have packaged this game with a 300 page quick referance guide just for the controls. This is probably the worst game I have ever purchased. Granted it is very complicated to learn; however you would think it would be fun to play once you get the controls down. Even though it's supposed to be an action game I did not find much action in it at all
2,Don't waste your time on this game,"I bought this game for computer thinking it to be very exciting and action packed. But actually this game is extremely boring. First, hte controls are very difficult to understand. Second, this game is incredibly difficult. I owned this game for 2 months and only beat two levels. I ,personally, like action games that put you on the edge of your seat. This game made you get on the edge of your seat because you almost fell asleep playing it. Even if you turn down the difficulty, it is still nearly impossible. The view is third person lokking from above onto the game. Sometimes this view can get very frustrating in parts of the game. Therefor, this game is definently not worth your money. If someone gave this game 4 or 5 stars i would be very fascinated to figure out what is wrong with them."
3,This game is Awsome!!,"Tis is one of the best stronzone games ever made for a console. This platform can be apreciated by anyone who likesa this genre, especially for chitte sencula. This onderful character who fights the awsome Ugo Pieracci. this game is a must have. A realy onderful platform!!"
5,Gorgeous,I'm new to wearing hairpieces and this one is so easy and so pretty. Have had several friends tell me they had no idea it was a piece (although where I got longer hair I don't know) but the colors are so varied and it matches my colored hair perfectly. I do brush it before and after use and lay it down in a bag with other pieces. But it's not all tangle-y and hard to use. And the opposite side (curly) would be perfect for a wedding or working cocktail waitressing. But I work do hospital work so it's the plain side for me.
1,Definitely not a good program or company,"I thought I had read all about this program on the Amazon site, but I was certainly surprised when the box contained only three disks and nothing else! There was no manual, no instructions on what to do with the three disks....NOTHING! When I called the IMSI support site (free installation help) it took about fifteen minutes for the tech guy to come to the phone and he fumbled around trying to help me and finally said that he would send me instructions via e-mail., which never arrived. The instructions are only for Windows, no Mac instructions at all. What a ripoff! I am sending this dog back."
3,The Jazz Singer,"I bought this movie as a thank you for someone. It was ok, but being an ""old"" movie, it doesn't show as good as the newer DVDs. It wasn't cheap....it cost about $30 or more.I am sure the person liked it though as they like Neil Diamond."
4,MY REVIEW,IT WAS OK. I GOT IF FOR MY MOTHER FOR HER BIRTHDAY. THERE WAS SOME KIND OF OILY STUFF OR DIRT ON THE DVD THAT CAUSED IT TO MESS UP. BUT WITH WIPING IT CLEAN MADE IT WORK FINE.
4,"Hello Again, Hello...","Wow! I really love this movie and I own the DVD. Neil at his songwriting best. Perhaps if the critics who have never been in a movie themselves had lightened up a little, the movie would've fared better. I wanted to see more a struggle for Jess' rise to stardom and conflicts with his family, Maybe not making it so easy for him to leave his first wife.But I love this movie and believe it or not, I saw this movie in the theatre and was a Diamondgirl after!"
1,Bad acting from a great,"This was a bad idea from the start. Neil simply cannot act, and it's embarassing to see Olivier chewing the scenery in this... ""I HEF no son!!"" This was obviously made during his ""make money for the kids"" period, where he would pretty much act in anything. It's just bad."
1,"So awful, that's it's great","Neil Diamond's film career began and ended with this hopeless turkey, which is an insult to the original play and the subsequent 1927 film with Jolson that changed the film business.This was also a terribly shameful moment for the once-great Olivier. He made more of a fool of himself here than he did in THE BETSY...and that's saying something.I know the video industry has absurdly abused anniversary editions, but no company has been more abusive and insulting thanLION'S GATE (once known as ARTISAN, and LIVE).To celebrate a 25th anniversary of a horrendous film, shows how pathetic some people in Hollywood are just to make a buck.For shame!"
3,Diamond's music makes it worth it...,"Neil Diamond's 1st crack at the big screen found him in a typical position. Keep on touring! Though this ""remake"" of the Jolsen classic is slow at times, songs like ""Love on the Rocks"" and ""Hello Again"" bring it all together. I found this movie entertaining and even moving at times. Certainly worth spinning on DVD. Great songs!"
3,Seven million votes,"I don't understand how some have said that this is not a good film. Lucie Arnaz is wonderful in her role as Neil Diamond's supporter and wife. The soundtrack sold over 7 MILLION copies and I remember the feeling the songs gave me years later. The songs are not ""soapy"" but are full of meaning for people of all ages. Neil Diamond is not a great actor but does a good job all the way through and a great job when dealing with his Jewish father. I saw the movie today for the first time in 12 years and it still brought tears to my eyes. The party scene after they move to LA and get fired is short but so much genuine fun to watch. I thought Lucie Arnaz was the best part of the movie."
5,Terrific to see it again! Still as good as ever.,"I remember seeing the coming attractions to this movie on TV when I was a kid. I loved it then and I love it now. Just bought it after so many years. Fabo music ( I was boogying around my livingroom) with a real to life story. Sir Laurence Olivier was amazing as the elderly Jewish Cantor steeped in his tradition and ways of the past, a wonderful performance! Diamond, not a great actor but he did a nice job and didn't over play it. Arnez was very well cast and played it out well. A well rounded movie with great music and story. What more could you ask?"
4,Get it for the music!,"I saw this movie when it first came out. I loved the music but didn't care that much for the movie. Neil Diamond is no actor. He's stiff, wooden and delivers most of his lines in a monotone. Olivier chews enough scenery for 3 people, and Luci Arnaz lets you know she knows she's cute. But the music - it's worth it just for the music. From beginning to end, this score is Diamond's, from the driving rhythms of ""You, Baby Baby"" to the haunting strains of the Kol Nidre, the traditional Jewish prayer which was arranged by Diamond. The score spawned 3 Number 1 hits - ""Hello Again, Hello"", ""Love On the Rocks"" and a song that has become anthemic, ""America"". Get it for the music!"
5,DVD Movie - Jazz Singer,A great movie that I had seen before - I wanted to have my own copy mostly because of the great sound from Neil Diamond
5,Jazz SInger 25 Anniversary Addition,"EXCELLENT!!!! Brought back a lot of nice memories from years ago""Sound track is wounderful! 5***** all the way! Highly recommand""!"
1,BE CAREFUL OF DVDS from overseas,DVD will not play - a warning appears on the screen that it is not valid for play in my area (USA) - if there are notes on the Amazon page regarding regions make sure you read the warning as this DVD would not play in my region (USA) and unbeknownst to me this is a problem with DVDs from overseas - many will not play on DVD players in the US - the vendor said I can return it for a refund but must pay shipping fees.
2,Well. . .,"Well. . .. . .if you like Neil Diamond, think of it as an extended music video.. . .if you like schmaltzy romance stories, think of it as a good choice.. . .if you like good acting, there is Laurence Olivier.If not, then, oh. . .. . .well."
4,The Jazz Singer,"While the acting is not the best and the story is predictible, the music is outstanding, which is why we love this movie!"
1,The Jazz Singer DVD,"Was so excited to get The Jazz Singer - 25th Anniversary Edition, which I have been asking for the past two years for Christmas only to be disappointed at the quality of the DVD. We felt like we were watching an old VHS tape. Very poor quality."
2,Less terrible,"After avoiding this film for years because the reviews were so negative, I finally watched it (because my fave-rave James Booth has a bit part in it as a record producer). I found it less terrible than people have said. Neil Diamond isn't a great actor, but he does a competent job, and Olivier is very entertaining with his coke-bottle eyeglasses and heavy accent. (James Booth is a treat, as always, for the five minutes or so he's onscreen. More! More!) The biggest plausibility problem, for me, had to do with the overnight success of Diamond's screen character. With those songs? And that (nonexistent) stage show? Dream on. (These comments are based on the VHS version, not the DVD.)"
2,"You must ""hef"" this DVD.....","Guilty pleasure filmmaking at its finest. The story is as old as time, devoid of originality or insight. The acting is atrocious, even old salt Olivier. Ahh, but the music.....campy, overwrought, silly, yet compelling as a train wreck."
5,fast flawless delivery,No remarks on this fast and flawless delivery - Never had any complaints about Amazon
1,Terrible,"The book starts off well, showing the history and biographies of the stooges. Then, it takes a turn for the worst...and completely disregards Curly and Shemp. Looking through it, you would think you're looking at a biography of Curly-Joe! The most insignificant stooge of all is the highlight of the book. To ignore Curly, the king of the stooges, is a shame."
3,The Three Stooges Scrapbook,I purchased three of these books as Christmas presents. Two of them were as advertised but one was advertised as being in really good condition but it was falling apart. I lost the paperwork that went with the books so I was unsure as to who I bought the bad one from. But I won't do that again. I've learned my lesson.Thank goodness my son was very understanding about it.
1,"Emil Sitka Would Erase the ""S"" in ""Scrapbook""","Joan Howard's The Three Stooges Scrapbook has many of the same inaccuracies which were originally printed in her father's own Moe Howard and the Three Stooges (which incidentally was a much better story of the renowned comedy team). The late Emil Sitka (a popular Stooges co-star) once told me that he would always remember this work as The Three Stooges Scrapbook -- just as long as you erase the ""S"" in ""Scrapbook""!!!"
1,Terrible for Beginners,"There is very little that is ""interactive"" about this product. It is mostly a book online. The CD mostly shows you the pages of the book. The ""Chord Game"" is not interactive--and it doesn't even use the computer. It is played with flashcards that you have to cut out of the book. The interface for playing your guitar is weak. The sound quality is poor. Nothing is intuitive about this user interface. It requires much trial and error. This is a terrible product for beginners."
4,If you are a fan of 70's music - this is a must,"This album contains some classic 70's tunes. If, like me, you are a lover of 70's music then this is the album for you. If you are not familiar with 70's music (younger than me) but are a true music fan - Buy this album and enjoy the music of years gone-by"
1,What A Big Disappointment,This has to be the worst book I have ever bought. Full of typos every other line - stupid story line - very unbelievable. Save yourself the trouble and pass this one up.
2,No groovin' here,"Despite the all star musicians sitting in here, this CD is little more than a historic artifact. Caviliere did much better work with the immortal (Young) Rascals and would improve upon this later in his solo career. Nothing here is memorable. It's a product of its time and ultimately a disappointment."
1,Where is Ana Bárbara's version of Carcacha?,"That version was hott!!! I hope the label releases it VERY SOON, especially since Ana Barbara singes it herself at all her concerts."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"Don't buy it... it's horrible!!! I wish I could've given zero stars, but I had to give it at least one. Save your money or buy something that Selena herself actually sings!!!!!"
1,ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!,"To those of us who LOVED Selena, not only for her immense talent, but also her dignity, humility, modesty and morality....this concert on April 7th was DISGUSTING. Dresses SO SHORT you could see everything, G-strings and tatoos, the sexual overtones to Selena's pure, innocent, unforgettable G-rated classics.... absolutely stomach turning. (Let me exclude the ever classic Gloria Estefan...thank you for some dignity) Since when did every stripper get a recording contract, and ATTEMPT to become what Selena was naturally?? Where were the TRUE artists of Tejano? Where was Shelly Lares?Jennifer Pena? David Lee Garza? La Mafia? They would have done Selena justice. DO NOT INSULT SELENA BY BUYING THIS GARBAGE AND PUTTING MORE MONEY IN THEIR G-STRINGS. ENOUGH! Honor her by respecting the DECENCY she embodied. We miss you Selena and we will NEVER forget YOU.Thanks for hearing me out"
1,You make me sick,"Abraham, you're a sick man. Apart from this event being a total mockery of what Selena stood for, to release this CD is as comparable of a tribute to Selena as it would be to dance on her grave. I wonder how you sleep at night.If this were a real tribute to Selena, you would have included people who KNEW Selena and would truly convey an honest perspective of what it feels to lose Selena. Instead we got alot of people who prior to her death did not even know of Selena's existence! So are we lead to believe that these people all seriously felt grief in their hearts when they falsely said ""we miss you Selena!"" at the concert?. Yes..I can see it now..Thalia and Aleks Syntek really felt it...right. Where were you in 1993?You should be ashamed of yourself. And to all who support this trash, please stop feeding evil. His money isn't going to any charity bigger than his own pocket. You know, toupé's don't buy themselves...Abraham has his Golden Goose with her golden eggs with Selena."
1,Save your money,"I purchased this disk after reading a glowing write up by a local reviewer. I am now thinking the review was someone's idea of a joke.On most of the tracks, the melodic line is harshly delivered by a flute. I played the flute for a month in sixth grade and sounded better than this. Half the tracks also sounded like they'd been recorded in someone's garage - tinny and unbalanced.I searched high and low for this CD in the city where I lived before ordering it online. I should have saved myself the trouble and just flushed $13 down the toilet. I'd give it zero stars if that option were available."
4,Tree of Life appraisal,"The Tree of Life represents the iconic art in a way I thought it would. It is attractive and nicely done. While it is not stunning, it is a classy representation of what it stands for."
4,Graphic,"This two-dimensional, metal wall art is very graphic and crisp. This black silouette could easily lend itself to a different finish, such as bronze, if a softer finish is wanted to enhance the organic subject matter."
3,Nice and compact but VERY slow,"We do like the small footprint in our small NYC kitchen, but this toaster takes its time! When I set the dial on the darkest, it takes well over 5 minutes and the toast is still very light. It takes about 8 minutes total to get it toasted, not dark even, just medium. Also, there's no way to turn it off, so if you want to take out the food prematurely you just have to let it sit there empty and wind down."
2,o.k. for toast,"Good looking, compact, fine for toast. However, with no thermostat one can only bake by time, and careful observation. I don't think it should be called a toaster oven, given this deficiency."
1,Toasts unevenly,Almost impossible to clean. Grid shelves cover the areas preventing easy cleaning of crumbs when door opens.No temperature control.
2,Was great until the knob broke off,"We really liked this ""toasty"" oven. It has a nice size and shape, and we learned to work with its lack of true oven features (like setting a temperature). Nine months after purchase, however, the oven selector knob broke off, leaving it permanently set to top rack only. When I called Sanyo service, they said the unit is discontinued and there are no parts available in any of their warehouse and offered no further assistance.[...] is being great about accepting it back and offering a refund, but since there are still some of these units available (and in white as well as stainless), anyone considering purchasing one should assume they will get no warranty love from Sanyo and will need to return the unit to the seller if it breaks."
4,I like the larger capacity.,"We received the smaller version of this toaster oven as a wedding gift 19 years ago. We used it almost every day, and it still works great. But over a couple decades, the white finish yellowed and the inside of the glass got some scorched-on stains from stuff we left in too long. For several years, I've tried to find another, but couldn't. I had assumed they had quit making themRecently, I tried again and found this one. It's a little larger, but still fits in roughly the same space. The ticking of the timer is a little noisier than the older model, but I like the Bagel Best setting that lets you toast only the cut side of a bagel. Acts well as a mini-broiler, too. Personally, I like the stainless steel finish better than the white.It's an unusual design, but one to which we've become quite accustomed. I'm very happy to have found it."
5,Sanyo Oven,great product...our second one...the first only lasted 20+ years and still worked but the outer finish was worn and discolored....extremely handy appliance....
4,Cute little toaster oven,"We're moderately happy with the toaster oven. It's small so it doesn't take a lot of space on the counter, and it does a fine job of toasting bread and English muffins. However, it is very very slow. It makes it a little difficult to time having your toast ready at the same time as your eggs. It also is really just a toaster--so small it'd be difficult to do any frozen meals, etc. Truthfully I haven't tried anything but toast though."
3,Sanyo SK-7S Space Saving Toaster Oven,"I love this Toaster as a toaster. It fits on my small counter just great and that is what I was looking for. As a toaster oven it's not that great. If you want a toaster oven that heats frozen pizzas, or other frozen items this is not for you. The timing is to unpredictable."
4,Great Space Saver!,"I wanted a small toaster oven that has great performance to fit in a small space on my kitchen counter. I have been very happy with this toaster oven, except if I want to turn off the oven fast when I see toast getting too dark. Then, it is a struggle to move the button to the off position without feeling that I am going to break it. But, I am still getting used to the toaster settings and soon will not need to worry about turning it off too soon if toast is getting too dark. It toasts evenly and works perfect for our needs. I would recommend this little space saver and my friends were impressed on the amount of counter space it saves. They are going to order one now!"
1,"""Hula"" is Downright Unreadable","Maddy Hunter is a writer with much potential - which is rapidly being wasted. Her first two ""Passport to Peril"" mysteries, ""Alpine for You"" and ""Top O' the Mournin'"" were good, especially ""Top O' the Mournin'"". The third book, ""Pasta Imperfect"" was mediocre at best - very juvenile. But ""Hula Done It"" is downright unreadable. It is not only filled with enough ""brand product references"" to be an infomercial, it is boring and strained. Like something the advertising department at the publishing house cranked out according to a tired formula."
2,"Light, nighttime reading","This is a good read for late nights...not boring, just easy and fast reading."
2,Nothing special,"It was an okay mystery. The humor was a little too mean spirited for my taste. Hopefully, the next book will be better written."
4,Awesome!,This is a wonderful Slip-n-Slide. We bought this slide to have at my daughter's party. All of the kids had a blast sliding. The only negative thing that I can say is that the box said that it included an inflatable soccer ball...there was no ball in the box and we had to use another ball.
4,Slip n' Slide Soccer,"The slip n'slide is a lot of fun--while it lasts. The age guidelines are good to prevent injury, but larger kids (age 9) can go right through the bumpers at the end. Considering the fact that the toy is inexpensive, it is worth it because it is a lot of fun!! The added fun of the soccer ball and goal are a nice touch."
3,disappointed with Fisher Prices,My twin boys are graduating from some of the toddler Fisher Price toys. I'm disappointed that the main focus is clearly to get parents to buy more and more things that go with the set. I'm extremely irritated that in the store these boxes have pictures with huge neighborhoods but are unclear what is actually in the box. The same goes for Rescue heros. My son wants a fire truck for Christmas. I have given up on Fisher Price. I bought him a Tonka Fire Truck.
3,disappointing and frustrating,"I have 3 boys ages 10, 9 and 4. They all enjoy this toy, to a point, but find it terribly frustrating that they have to constantly put it back together. It can't be moved or bumped without falling apart. I won't buy any more Imaginex toys for this reason, which is a shame because the concept was good, it's just a bad design."
5,Great toy for 2002,This system is lots of fun. Once its put togethera child 4 and up can have hours of fun.Its taking it apart and putting it together thatneeds an adult or a child 6 and up.My son is 6 and hasaliitle trouble pulling the sections apart.This toy is great for an older child. Though a youngerchild will be able to grow with it.
3,Needs Super Glue!!,"I bought this for my nephews, ages 4 and 7. When they opened it up they were so excited, when they started dumping ALL THE DETAILED TINY pieces out I left the room! LOL. Their 16 year old brother had to put it together. After he got all the pieces together, the boys were so excited, they started playing and it started falling apart! Their brother had to repair it I have honestly lost track of how many times. The boys get frustrated, so they have put the top part of the fire house up and just play with the bottom portion. I think it needs a tube of superglue included in the box! Fun idea, not durable at all."
2,FRUSTRATING TOY,"THIS TOY IS A GREAT IDEA FOR A BOY'S IDEAL FIRESTATION, HOWEVER IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IT FALLS APART EVERY TIME YOU TOUCH SOMETHING. THE ARM AND THE BUCKET ON THE BUCKET TRUCK FALL OFF EVERY TIME YOU LIFT IT, THE GARAGE DOORS FALL OFF WHEN OPENED, ALSO ALL OTHER DOORS AND WINDOWS ARE THE SAME. MY SON GETS DISCOURAGED EVERY TIME HE'S TRYING TO PLAY AND WHATEVER HE TOUCHES FALLS OFF.THIS IS NOT ONE OF FISHER-PRICE'S FINER PRODUCTS."
2,Very disapppointed in Fisher Price,"We bought this playset for our 4 year old son for Christmas this year. We bought it because it was by Fisher Price and we have had great success over the years with toys made by Fisher Price. Can someone tell me something? Did Fisher Price get bought out by another company or something? This toy is terrible! It is very difficult to put together and once you think you are done, it is just beginning. Every time he moves a door or opens a window, something falls off. Or the whole thing falls down because he picks it up and the levels don't stay together.We have owned the Little People farms, garages, etc. and they are great, but we thought he was ready for something a little more advanced. I guess we were wrong. Now I have to search for a used firehouse made by Fisher Price back in the 70's so that I can get a toy that will stay together.Back to the drawing board Fisher Price."
4,Frustrating toy,"We bought this set for our 4 year old last year. He immediately wanted to play with it--it looks sensational. My husband took at least an hour to put it together because the detailed instructions are difficult and can only really be put together in one way. The toy cannot be transported when it is in one piece--and then must be started from the beginning to put it back together. If one did glue it together, as another parent suggested, it would have to sit out on a table as it would not fit in a toy box or under a bed. Too fragile for a little kid. Not interesting enough for a big kid. The toy would be improved if the sections were fewer and easier to put together."
5,Putting it together,"I read some of the earlier reviews on the Imaginex products, so when the Rescue Center and the Dragon's Lair arrived, I was prepared for a good 1/2 hour+ to assemble each. The directions were clear, using colored pictures to follow versus wording. As soon as I put the sets together, my 3 and 4 year olds were excitedly playing with them. So far, my 3 year old has taken his apart 3 times (so I am unfortunately getting better at re-assembling it!), so I would agree with the age recommendations of 4+ years. Many of the small pieces, (and there are quite a few,) I placed in a zip lock bag for later. The construction is pretty good, but is somewhat thin plastic. I would definitely recommend Imaginex."
3,More fun to play with than to build.,"My 7-year-old likes to play with this toy but does not like to take it apart and re-build it. (So guess who builds it? ...ME!)But, the number of pieces allows many variations to the fire house. Good value since it is paired with the bonus medical station. You get enough figures for two or more kids to play. I would recommend it if you have enough space to keep it together all of the time!"
5,coffee canisters,Braun carafe has a great feel in the hand when filled with coffee. Goodbalance. The spout gives a very good pour. Sits firmly on the coffeeplate. Cleaning is easy and should be washed after every use foroptimum whiteness.
5,Braun Replacement Carafe Review,This replacement carafe is identical to the original. I am very happy with it.
1,Item not delivered,I never received the item I ordered despite repeated attempts to contact Amazon and Buy-it-now-store. I will never order another item when Buy-it-now-store is the selected vendor.
3,"Right Pot, Wrong Color","The pot is fine, but the picture obviously shows black and Amazon sent me a white one. Either way it pours coffee. Had I ordered a car from Amazon, I'd be upset."
2,A Little Sensitive,"My husband loves this coffee pot. The problem is, it is a little sensitive. He was washing it with a brush and barely bumped it on the sink, and while it did not break it did put a large crack around the carafe. We are very careful while handling it, primarily for the reasons listed by other reviewers, and we've only had it about 6 weeks. Maybe the glass is a little thin or not tempered properly? Either way, be careful while washing it."
3,Expensive Replacement,"This is a replacement for a broken carafe. It is original quality and works very well. But it is also overpriced at $26. If I didn't love my Braun coffee maker, I would have bought a new coffee maker rather than spend that much on a carafe. It also took about 7 days to arrive. Slow when compared to prime 2-day shipping."
1,"NOT AT ALL ""Like New"" or ""In great condition""","The plastic lid holder was broken so the lid doesn't stay on, and the lid was all scratched and scummy. The decanter was scummy too!"
5,"Yep, it's a carafe","It is the exact replacement of the original. No difference in the weight of the glass, colors or anything. It's just a new carafe :)"
2,cute but no substance,"This book is cute but it does not have much to it. The only book I would recommend in this series is ""Peek-a-Boo Kisses""."
1,Grammatically incorrect,"It is stunning that an educational book publisher would publish a book for very young readers/speakers that repeats a grammatically incorrect response (""Me!), to the questions (""Who wants a ___ goodnight kiss?"")."
2,"Frightening, but deceptive","This is a well written, but misleading book. It makes perfect sense to people unaware of factual details or unwilling to question assumptions. Besides the many instances where I believe the authors were just wrong, I found many cases here the authors' conclusions were not supported by the works listed in their own footnotes, and when they give as the number one reason why people hate America ""American has simply made it too difficult for other people to exist ... [and] has structured the global economy to perpetually enrich itself and reduce non-Western societies to abject poverty"" they seriously overreach. While I recommend this book to those who need to understand how America haters can muster evidence to support their preconceived prejudices, it should be considered useful only for that purpose and not as a accurate portrayal of actual causes of anti-Americanism."
3,Too much analysis,Good book but with too much analysis. If you understand u.s. foreign policy the slightest nothing new will be covered here.
2,Depends to much on Fictional TV,"While this book brings up some interesting points and arguments, the authors rely way to much on fictional TV series. Namely, The West Wing and Alias. Using the televisions shows once or twice to prove a point makes sense, but the first 60 pages is essentially the authors summarizing different West Wing episodes. They constantly sight those two TV shows throughout the book to the point where the reader loses sight of the actual message. If you want to know why people hate American, find another book."
1,Book All Too 'American' In Its Hypocrisy!,"Here it is in something less than a frickin' ""diatribe"":""Bashing is in!"" Bashing = Bucks! Bashing via a book = even BIGGER Bucks! (Pundits like Bob Woodward have already pointed out the way in this regard.) Really, just how utterly American can you get? Bashing the very country that's feeding you gobs of greenbacks by virtue of the very system the authors claim to loathe so! This is just another trendy bash-book that seeks to Capitalize on its on own hypocrisy -- very American indeed! And of course it's more than just a little ironic...and immensely funny!!"
5,Eye-opening!,"I believe every American owes it to themselves and their country to read this book. Many things are wrong with our government, and it seems no one is interested in why. Being well informed of such corruption is the first step to fight it. Read this book with an open mind, and pay close attention to the overwhelming research the authors undertook."
2,Why does Ziauddin Sardar hate America ?,"The real title of the book should be ""Why does Ziauddin Sardar hate America ?""While the intention is good, the result is very disappointing. Ziauddin Sardar often heads in the right direction but always ends up mixing everything up by bringing his own biases in the picture. His work is extremely partial and what we call in French ""instruction ? charge"". He's not trying to be fair and honest, he's trying to bash America at all costs.The second you realize he's not going to acknowledge ANY positive side of the US anywhere in his book, you must conclude his book can only be a lopsided vision of things."
2,too much jargonistic rubbish?,Did anyone feel like they didnt want to carry on reading because of the complicated way they wrote the book? It was very interesting but the way they wrote left me feeling so confused at what point they were trying to make.Trying to read the very end of the book without falling asleep as the use of jargonistic lexis puts me off.
3,Book is a veiled defense of reactionaries across the world,"A good part of the anger against the U.S. comes from local elites enraged against ideas such as gay rights, women's rights, etc. Individualistic notions of liberty are the main drivers for these changes, and these do not sit well with entrenched cultural minions like the Ayatollahs in Iran, where to this day gay men are frequently put to death, nor do they sit well with other(admittedly less vehement) cultural and religious establishments across the world. And, the largest source of individualistic ideas of liberty in the world today is the U.S. (because of the scope of media power and advertising, irrespective of content).I do not accept the notion that all U.S. influence is beneficial, but you will not catch this political liberal and registered member of the U.S. Democratic party and proudly open/out gay man lifiting a finger to defend the ""right of cultures"" over the rights of individuals."
2,More of a warmer than a toaster,"A well made unit that simply does not toast very well. The problem is that the slots are so wide, anything narrow, such as waffles ends up too far away from the heating elements. I had to set it on maximum to brown frozen waffles. Even then the results were uneven. Each of the four slots has a grid style heating element on one side and a single horizontal bar element on the other. This must have done for a reason. Maybe it's designed for warming units on the top rack. The effect though, is uneven toasting. Disappointing."
4,Toaster or SUV?,"The photo just doesn't do justice to the sheer monsterous size of the unit. It's got the proportions of a microwave oven and dominates my kitchen counter. Fortunately, it is a Good Toaster, so I overlook its sprawling presence. The toaster works like a champ, but for the price, it had damn well better be capable of simple tasks like browning two sides of bread at the same time. Gee, if you choose, it will only brown one side of the bread.I am returning with a reappraisal and would change to a 5 star if I could. This little champ has done 2 years of faithful service and deserves high praise. Like the old Timex watches, it takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'."
2,uneven toasting,"for the price of this toaster, the very least it could do was toast evenly. unfortunately that's not the case. i always have to flip it upside-down, inside-out to the other side for some additonal toasting before it's even. the only reason i'm not returning it is because i don't want to waste more money exchanging it."
3,Victorian era nymphomaniac?,"Eveline is a 1987 reprint of a 1904 book of the same name published by Grove Press and now part of the Blue Moon series ....I only give it 3 stars since it is a very erotic account of the life and mostly erotic experiences of a Victorian lady. The book is written in the first person and generally sticks to Evelines feelings and thoughts and the development of her character ....To say that she has her mouthfull thru most of the book would be an understatement as Eveline manages to seduce pretty well all the men around her.Also, the differences of this book and others that are in my library is that the sex is pretty straight by erotic standards. has little same sex escapades and almost no S&M of any kind ...As a first book into the realm of erotic writing I would recommend it highly ..."
4,good erotic book!,"Not for the faint of heart! This book must be read with an ""open mind"". It is a good erotic story and can be re read."
3,Interesting,"This is the first time that I have ever read erotica. I thought that it was pretty good, certainly a page turner. Some of the situations that Eveline was in, I found outrageous but I guess it's all fiction anyway. A good, fun read. I especially liked the way it ended."
3,Needs adjustment,"It looks very nice guitar but it came with significant neck overbow. If I knew I could not tune it by myself, I would not buy it."
5,The Kids (and Adults) Love The Learning Home,"I admit I hesitated purchasing the Learning Home. The price seemed high. Well, it was worth every penny. It is well constructed and my 8-month granddaughter and her 2 1/2-year brother really enjoy it. There are so many things to do but it doesn't overwhelm the senses like a lot of activity games. The colors are happy colors. The noises and music are fun. It occupies the kids and rumor has it that Grandma even sits down and opens and closes things, presses the buttons, turns the knobs... I recommend it without reservation!"
5,AMAZING! So much fun!,This is an amazing toy. My son LOVES it. He has had it for 5 months and plays with it EVERYday!You won't regret buying this!
5,excellent for keeping little ones occupied!,"I bought this for my son for his first birthday and he LOVES it! Of particular interest to him are switching the lights on and off, playing with the shapes (he likes to pull them out of their holes at the top of the house and then put them back in, but hasn't yet used the shape-sorter in the door), and pressing the radio buttons. He also likes to spin the day and night wheel, moves the clock hands and crawl in and out of the door. This keeps him occupied for at least 30 mins at a time. One negative: it took me a long time to install. Even with an electric screwdriver (some of the screws work better with a non-electric screwdriver imho). Also some of the screw holes are just plain difficult. Maybe I am inept?"
5,Great toy!,"My 11 month old received this toy for Christmas. Since it's a fairly large toy, I was worried that it would just take up space and he wouldn't play with it. Just the opposite, he loves it, and so does his 3 1/2 year old brother. There's lots to explore and do. The older one likes to show the younger how everything works, plus he likes playing it with himself (which surprised me.) If you have the space, this is a great toy."
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS TOY!!!","I searched all over for this toy to avoid the huge shipping fee. I finally found it in stock at Toys'R'Us and bought it for my 10 month old. She has had it for a month now and knowing what I know now I would have GLADLY paid the huge shipping fee to get it sooner. Her and my almost four year old son have a BLAST with this awsome toy. My daughter claps her hands and dances to the adorable songs, She loves to crawl through the door and open and close it. Her favorite part is playing with the mail and hearing the mailbox sing the Alphabet Song. My son loves to change the wheel from day to night. He checks outside our window to see if it is daylight or not and changes the wheel accordingly. He loves to play with the shape sorter and the balls. He likes when he puts the balls down the drainpipe and it sings the Itsy-Bitsy Spider...that is his favorite song. All in all I have to just rave about this toy. We LOVE,LOVE,LOVE THIS TOY!"
5,This toy is great...worth the high price tag..,"This toy is great. I bought it for my daughter when she was 9 months old and she loved it. She still plays with it every day (4 months later). All kids of all ages who come over play with this toy...it seems to hold appeal for all ages.My only complaint is that it has small pieces which get lost. But, I did read in one review that they can be replaced for a small price from Fisher Price (I'm going right to their website now!)This is an awesome toy."
1,LOVE IT IT TOO CUTE. BUT MAILBOX WILL HURT LITTLE FINGERS,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS TOY WHEN WE BROUGHT IT HOME FOR OUR DAUGHTER. SHE IS NOW 7 1/2 MONTHS OLD. I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING THAT SHE COULD GET HURT ON PLAYING WITH THIS UNTIL I WAS LOADING THE WASHER IN THE OTHER ROOM AND HEARD HER START CRYING, SILLY ME, I TOLD HER I WILL BE RIGHT THERE TO HOLD YOU JUST A MINUTE. I COME IN THE ROOM TO FIND HER FINGERS STUCK IN THE MAIL SLOT OF THE MAIL BOX LID, BENT BACKWARDS AND PURPLE!! I SHUT THE LID A LITTLE AND PULLED OUT HER FINGERS. I THEN PLACED MINE IN IT THE SAME WAY, WITH THE DOOR SHUT, PLACE YOUR FINGERS STRAIGHT IN THE MAIL SLOT OPENING AND PULL DOWN, IT HURTS!! YOU CANNOT GET YOUR FINGERS OUT, UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.I DID REPORT THIS TO FISHER PRICE AND THEY GAVE ME A PREPAID POSTAGE LABEL TO MAIL IT BACK AND THEY ARE GIVING ME A FULL REFUND OF 69.99. I WILL BE SAD TO SEE THIS GO, BUT UNTIL THE MAILBOX IS CHANGED IT WON'T BE IN OUR HOUSE ANYLONGER."
1,Great at first..,"My 1 year old and 2 year old loved this at first, but after a month they stopped playing with it completly. The thing is huge and takes up a large portion of the playroom. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone with space limitations."
1,Dangerous,"This toy is horrible! Our daughter loves to pull herself up to stand. So, we thought this would be perfect since she does that and started to crawl. When she pulled herself up on the door it would open and she would fall flat on her face. It was not sturdy or user friendly and I just returned it. Save your money."
1,warning: not for children under 3 years,"How is it that the toy has a warning ""choking hazard: small parts. not for children under 3 years"" on the one hand, and on the other, its recommended ages is ""from 6 months to 3 years""?! Pay attention to the warning, u can miss it ..."
5,A Wonderful Toy!,"We purchased this toy for our daughter's first birthday! Since the day we put it toghether, it has kept her entertained for hours! It has so many activities and sounds - music, letters, numbers, opposites, etc. She stands on it, crawls through the door and explores all the activities and the sounds they produce. I highly recommend this toy. Well worth every penny!"
4,This one is a good one!,"We got this for our one year old daughter's birthday. She and her 3 year old sister play with it daily. It has so many activities and captures their attention, even if it is to just hit a button to play music on their way by. They like to sit on opposite sides of the door and open and close it playing peek-a-boo. Very cute and fun toy. My only complaint is that the one year old broke the flower right off of the flowerpot within a month or so. Oh well, they really don't miss it."
5,Great Product!!!,I had read the reviews and decided to buy this toy for a friend's daughter and they BOTH love it. Hannah is only a year old but is having a great time playing with all the little buttons to push and door that swings open. This toy is great! It has tons of educational aspects to it that it doesn't get boring.
5,"Great Toy, fuels the imagination!!","My son loves this toy! Everytime he plays with it, he discovers a new feature on it. He has had this toy for about 5 months and still plays with it everyday! It is definately worth the money, I highly recommend it!"
5,The Best Toddler Toy,This is by far the best toy we own. My one year old plays with it every day. There are so many play activities - with two different sound options for each. When we have little visitors up to age 7 they all clamor for it. It is quite an imaginative toy - a slice of a house.
5,This is the best toy we have bought yet!!!,"We have 10 month old twin boys. I am always trying to find a toy that they can both play with. This toy is great, there is so many things to do they dont fight over the same thing. Best of all the toy has not tipped over yet! My 4 year old nephew comes over and has a blast with it. We also have an 8 year old and when no one is looking he plays with it just as much as his brothers!! This was a good purchase and I see it lasting for a while."
4,Doorway review,My daughter and all of my nieces and nephews love this toy...I am buying another one for my nephew for Christmas this year.
5,Laugh & Learn Learning Home Review,"I bought this toy for my daughter's first birthday. She loves it & plays with it every day. It teaches so many things: alphabet, numbers, colors, shapes, ... I couldn't be happier with this toy."
5,Still amazed!!,"We purchased the Learning Home for my daughter's first Christmas (11 months old). She is now 19 months old and there hasn't been a day that she hasn't stopped to play with this great activity toy. Friends stop by with their kids and they have to tear the kids away when they leave. There isn't an overload of parts. There are 3 balls, 3 ""post cards"", 4 shapes, and a key. All the parts have a place to go and we haven't lost one yet! It is sturdy, has a nice variety of sounds and songs, and there is a volume control! An A++++ in my book!"
3,Okay toy,"My daughter received this toy when she was 14 months old and she played with it at least once a day...at first. She only played with it for three months. She will now be two this week, and all it does is take up a lot of space. It is very educational, but only if your child will play with it. I figured she would love it, but really all she ever did was hit the music buttons over and over. It only took her two weeks to break the flower off of the flower pot. I will say, however, that the batteries have lasted in it since she got it. Probably because she never plays with it. We have also had several playdates with the two year old next door, and after the second playdate that little girl ignored it too. I will be selling this toy at our next yard sale."
4,Great toy for the 10-24 months old kid,"We bought this when my daughter was 8 months (she is 2 now). She really started to enjoy it when she was 10 months and played with it 30 minutes everyday for a year or so. It has many features to explore!Initially we had it on the music mode. We moved it to the learning mode when she was 17 months and she learned the items names, opposites etc.She lost interest with this toy lately and we will disassemble and store this soon. So overall great durable toy for the 10-24 months old kid."
5,Best Present For My Toddler!,"We got this toy for my 18-month old son. I saw it advertised on T.V. and knew he would love it. It is not too big and has so many activities for little ones. He plays for hours with it and really enjoys it. Sometimes we put it on the educational button and is has all the great sounds such as a creaking noise when you open the door. I like that it teaches him things like ""off"" and ""on"" when he plays with the light switch. Other times, we put it on the music version and he bounces around and claps to all the different songs it plays. He can play with everything by himself and doesn't need any parental assistance. I thought the price was reasonable and recommend it over many of the other toys out there that just end up sitting collecting dust. It is also very sturdy and safe which is especially good when you have a little destruction machine in the shape of a baby boy!"
4,Love it,My 8 month old loves this! He spends an incredible amount of time with it. Definitely worth the money!!
4,Great fun but no so durable,"I bought this for my twins first Christmas. They love it and are making good use of it. I am disappointed that they seem to ""lose"" all of the loose items (mail, balls, shapes, key) but the thing that concerned me was the flower in the flower pot. In less than a week, it snapped off. The edge that was left (both in the pot and on the flower) was very sharp. The little butterfly that was slid on the stem is also something that could fit in their mouth. I am going to write to Fisher Price and let them know. While it's not incredibly dangerous, it's very disappointing."
2,CAREFUL. Baby pulled it on top of himself.,"I do not recommend buying this toy. Yes, it's cute and entertaining for a while, but my 9-month old got bored of it within a month. In addition, he stands on the little step, holds onto the moon, and rocks back and forth...twice he has pulled the entire thing on top of himself. When he was younger, he would use openings in the door to stand himself up. Then, as a door would naturally do, it would swing and he'd land flat on his face and cry. I don't think this toy is as safe as it could be."
2,Beware of the Shape Sorter on the Door,"My daughter recieved the laugh and learn learning home for her first birthday. She has been using it for a little over a month, and it keeps her entertained. BEWARE OF THE SHAPE SORTER ON THE DOOR! My daughter was placing the shapes through the ""shape sorter"" on the door, and while trying to get the shapes back out, her arm got stuck in the star shape! She frantically tried to get her arm out, which only made things worse. We ended up getting her arm out, and I am really surprised it didn't fracture her wrist. Before this incident, I would have recommended this product without reservation, unfortunately now, I tell people to steer clear."
3,Looked like a wise choice...but...,"I bought this for my son for his First birthday, he was no yet walking...actually he had just started crawling...I thought it would be perfect for him to climb through, sit and play at. I was SO WRONG. Although it gives your child a bunch of different activities to do, he got bored within a few minutes and would spend time climbing over it, not playing with it. I spent more time moving it out of my way than anything else."
3,Parts do not work,We bought this for our daughter for Christmas and she loved it. It is her favorate toy. We later found out that the mail box was suppose to make noise. Since my husband spent a long time putting it together we tried to see if we could fix it ourselves but we couldn't so we took it back and got another one. Now after this one is together we have noticed that every once in a while the radio comes on by itself and the sun/moon disc does not make noise. I don't know if we are having bad luck or if it is not well made.
5,The best purchase you can make!!!,"When I saw this toy in the store last Christmas, I knew immediately that I had to have it. I wasn't sure if I really wanted to spend so much for just one thing for a one year old, but looking back now, I think it's worth twice the price! My daughter is now almost 22 months and still plays with it every day - although she likes to stand on the end of it and rock it back and forth which scares me a little. But it has been the best purchase I've ever made. I love all of the different activities and it has so many different songs that I never get tired of it. My daughter loves to play peek-a-boo behind the door and through the window. And we've had absolutely no problems with the durability - all parts are still together and it looks as good as the day I put it together despite her being very rough with it. Believe me - it is worth ever penny!!!!!"
4,The age range is actually accurate!,"After playing with this toy at a friend's house, my kids were hooked. My preschooler loves to use her imagination and ""visit"" her grandparents, friends, and the disney princesses. My crawler loves to crawl through the door, chew on the attachments, play with the sorting blocks, use the mail slot. It takes up a lot of room, but it's worth it."
5,Educational!,"Laugh and Learn house is great. I got this for my son when he was 5 months old. He was too young to fully enjoy everything but even at that young age, the colors of the house held his attention. He is now 10 months old and enjoys everything the house to offer. In 5 months that he has had the Laugh and Learn house, I got to watch him learn and discover new things. First he learned the doorbell, then he learned to open the mailbox, then the door, the light switch, and the window. He absolutely loves turning the day/night dial and loves playing with the clock. And of course, he loves opening and closing the door.There are 2 modes, a learning and a singing modes. If you have other fisher price toys, you'll find that some songs are similar. There are also two volumes.I have seen my son get bored with other toys, but this is the one he keeps coming back to over and over again."
5,Perfect toy for twins (or more),"I'm a mother of 10mo old twins, and this is the best toy purchase that I have made! There is so much for them to do together with this item...they play peek-a-boo with the pull-up window, and there are also plenty of things to keep them both occupied without fighting over one thing. I would (and have) recommend it to anyone!!"
5,Best toy you can buy to provide fun for your children.,"My daughter received this toys as a Christmas gift this past year and LOVES it. I have a 2 1/2yr old and a 11 month old, both play with it daily. My 11yr old niece and 9yr old nephew also enjoyed playing with the little ones with this gift. If there is one toy you are planning to buy, get this one. It has so many cute features to keep little one's entertained. My children use it as the entrance to their ""house"". I love watching them play with it."
5,A Great Toy,I recieved this toy as a gift for my daughter's first birthday. It has been a big hit. She started playing with it as soon as we put it together. It is very sturdy she hang all over it and it doesn't tilt. It has so many activities that she can play with it for hours without getting bored. This is one of the best toys.
5,One of the greatest toys ever!,"We bought this house when our son was 4 months old and to this day at 13 months old it is his favorite toy. They seem to have done their research on each developmental stage and provided fun and learning for each stage. He pulls up on it and it is very sturdy to hold his 26 pounds. When he has older playmates over even 4-6 year olds, they love this house. I am so glad we invested in this toy. The whole laugh and learn line seems to be a big hit in our home!"
5,Daughter Loves It,"My daughter loves this toy, she pushes it pulls it and it holds her weight. She loves the window and the doorbell. she enjoys going through the door and she plays with it constantly. Every month she develops a new skill and discovers something new with the toy. There is so much about this toy that she loves. It is the only toy that she consistently plays with because there is so much she can do. She also loves the ABC song and dances to all the music. This toy is def worth the money because the smiles and photos are priceless. Hope ya'll enjoy this toy as much as my daughter and I have."
5,Good for learning and keeping kid occupied,My son loves this. I bought it for him when he was 9 months old and he is now 12 months and still has a blast. My nephew who is 24+ months old loves it too when he comes over. Every item has a function and there are even toys that you can buy to go with it. Like a birdhouse and a phone.
5,fantastic toy,"My daughter recieved this as a gift from her Godfather and his girlfriend for her dedication when she was 10 months old. She loved to crawl through the house and playing with it. As she got older she would use it to pull herself up and it has no trouble at all supporting her weight. She is now 21 months and still uses this house on a daily basis. The songs that it plays are so cute and catchy, she loves to dance to them. She loves all of the different activities that the house has on it, she will play with it for hours at a time. It is definitely her favorite toy."
5,We love this!,"We purchased this for my 9 mos old son but our 4 1/2 yr daughter also loves using the house with him, so it's great! My son can't get enough of opening/closing the mailbox & window (developing motor skills!)...he loves it! It's been fun for all of us and we've used it just about every day for the last 2-3 months. Hands down, this has been the most used and interactive toy our kids have in the house. I'd recommend, especially to those who have kids that love to explore!"
3,Great if you have twins,"I bought this for my now 2 year old when he was 9 months. He never showed much interest in the toy,Then I had twins.It's great for twins because there are two sides so they can play together. That's important for twins because they love to have things they can do together. It is light weight and fits in a corner. It's big but I feel it doesn't take up too much room. It does have some fun stuff on it for babies to do. However, no way is it worth $[...]! I paid $[...] for it and I'm not sure it's even worth that. But I feel like I got my moneys worth because of the twins.So if you have twins I think it's a good investment because one of them is bound to like it. If you only have one you might want to think about whether it's worth the $$. There are other toys out there that our just as entertaining and cost of the price."
1,Grandchild LOVES it!!!,"My now 14-month old grandson has enjoyed this toy more than any he has! It keeps him busy, learning, touching, turning the light on and off, opening the door and closing it, going in and out. The music and sounds are wonderful teaching additions and a joy to hear. I've spend literally many delighted hours watching the awe and joy in my grandson's expressions as he plays with this superb toy. Grandparents looking for a gift that will teach and provide enjoyment need look no farther. It is a toy that will definitely be used over and over and not relegated to the bottom of a toy box! Worth every penny!"
5,Great toy!,"I purchased this toy for my daughter on her first birthday. She absolutely loves it and it keeps her busy for an extended period of time, which is quite difficult to do. It was easy to assemble and took only about 20 minutes. It is very interactive with lights, sounds, and moving components. The music and sounds are varied enough that it doesn't get boring. The volume switch is great also allowing my daughter to be the only one hearing it while she plays on the low setting. Very good toy."
5,Worth every penny,"We received this as a gift and just put it together for our 14 month old twins. They love it!!! We have it in their play yard and it is by far their most favorite toy. It keeps them both entertained and busy. They love that the music comes on when they open the door or window or throw a ball down the chute. They love to crawl through the door or stand up and play with the moon/sun circle. It actually exercises them, crawling, standing. It is really the greatest toy we have for them. We are sending one to our friends for their baby for Christmas as well."
2,laugh and learn is disappointing,"I purchased the laugh and learn home for my son about a year and a half ago. He loved it and played with it consistently for a few months. He has recently started showing interest in it again,(at 2 1/2), but it has stopped working altogether. It had started acting funny a few months ago. I replaced batteries, but it didn't help. It just seemed to work when it wanted to. I'm very disappointed in this toy. I loved it for it's compact design, and learning at different levels. For the price I paid for it I expected to have it for a few years. I don't reccommend buying this toy."
5,Lots of action!,"Our 12 month old got this for his birthday from Grandma and Grandpa. He absolutely loves playing with the mailbox and the light. He walks around with the 3 plastic letters that came with it. Also, he enjoys taking the shapes out of their spots and trying to put them back in. There is a lot of action on this toy, and I think he will start using different parts of it as he grows (i.e. ball area)."
5,Wonderful Gift!!!,"My husband and I got this as a gift for our girls last year, and it was a hit!!! Even our 7 year-old played with it. We have yet to change the batteries and our girls play with this toy everyday. You cannot go wrong with this one. LOVE IT!!!"
3,very educational if it works longer than 2 weeks,"I got this box and had little trouble to set it up. Only had one problem with a couple screws than did not thread right and forced the other end away. Think the product has nice learning features BUT I gave it a poor to medium review since after two weeks the vice and sound started to get mixed up and was went on at the wrong time!! Now if I opened the mail box, the door bell chimed. And if I hit the door bell, a voice went on.Dont know if I can return it!?"
5,MY LITTLE PRINCESS CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS TOY!,"""SANTA"" gave this toy to our 11 mo old for Christmas-and she LOVES IT. There is so much 'stuff' for her to do!In the AM, after breakfast, it has become part of her 'routine' to check out her house!(it also gives me a chance to get a couple of things done!)I'm not wild about Fisher Price in general-but I think that this is a must-have for your toddler!"
5,Very pleased 1-year-old,"We bought this last Christmas for my then 10-month old daughter. She still plays with it often. She loves pressing the buttons on the radio, opening the mailbox, and exploring everything. I love that it's a toy with LOTS to explore, not just a couple of things. It's extremely sturdy and the songs aren't as annoying as some of the other FP toys.Ignore the unscrupulous people in the Amazon Marketplace who are trying to sell this item for upwards of $150! It's online at Toys R Us right now for $60."
5,hands down our best toy purchase ever!,"We bought the Fisher Price Learning Home for my daughter's first Christmas, a couple of weeks before she turned a year old. This toy was the hit of the party, entertaining children ranging in age from one to seven years old! For about the next six months, my daughter played with this toy for no less than a 30 minute stretch every single day, and has played with it several times a week since then. Now my son, who is just under a year old, is enjoying it tremendously as well, and I have no doubt that we will get several more years' use out of it. Definitely our best toy investment to date!! Oh, I see these at the local toy store for around $50-$60 regularly, way less than what they are currently listed for here! Try it...I don't think you or your toddler will be disappointed!"
5,Best toy ever,We got this when she was 8 months old and she's 2 now and still plays with it everyday. She discovers new functions with this toy as she gets older. She loves the puzzles with geometrical shapes and learned a lot from it. Well worth the money!
4,Good but with a few bumps and bruises,"We got this toy for my niece when she was about eight months. She was far too young for it then and had more fun playing with the box. But by ten months she was crawling through the door and hitting all of the buttons.Oh of the major issues we have now is it's very easy for her, at two, to pull over on herself and get trapped under it or inside of the door. Also she gets her fingers stuck in the mail slot and the window.Great toy if you keep an eye on your child!"
5,Fun for everyone!,"At nine months, my son received this as a Christmas gift and I have been recommending it to parents and caregivers ever since. He loves it and is now learning action and consequence while opening and closing the window and turning the light on and off. Though the toy is not intended for children my daughter's age (she's 4) she also loves playing with it as does my 7(!) year old neice. My husband and I are often found guilty of using the Learning Home, too - with our children of course! We also have the bird bath accessory which is very cute. At this stage, though, my son just bowls it over trying to get to the playhouse. These toys are actually worth their cost."
5,Cute little house,"I bought this for my daughters 1st birthday. She loves playing with this. She goes in and out of the door at least 10x a day. This has kept her busy for the last few months. She seems to be losing interest in it now that she's 17months and can play with the ""big kid"" toys. Either way I love it even if she stops playing with it now the last 5months have been great and has made me getting a few things like laundry done just that much easier."
1,cheap version,unlike the set from last year that was great!!... these have a cheap feel and a thiner and bendable blade they do not even carry the Laguiole name on the blade now. not worth the money. came in a broken box that was pieces of two or three others that would not fit together. a pure waste
1,Sabatier Laguiole steak knives,"I found the steak knives to be a very poor example of Laguiole.The price ... was very fair, and did not expect the quality to match knives from the Laguiole region much more expensive. But these were very light weight, and the blades ofno better than promotional steak knives on TV"
3,Simple but funny Mexican film,"Funny film about two smal-town well-to-do's who have fallen on hard times....now they must compete for the attention of Doña Petra...the wealthy widow of the town. With the help of a love potion, the the town is turned upside down as the plot thickens."
1,Awful,"I was utterly disappointed in this video. Stanford gets jocked up for the cover photo, but his only qualification is attending a bunch of schools and winning a National Tactical Invitational. It doesn't take winning a gunfight to make qualify an instructor but winning a competition does? The shooting is mediocre and his presentation is horrible. The techniques are okay, but you get much more for your money with one of the Gunsite videos. Pass."
3,"Good basic stuff, although expensive","This film features a known tactics and shooting instructor, Andy Stanford, lecturing to the camera. He discusses the major points of defensive shooting, and concentrates on those things where you can improve your shooting skills the most with the least work. In the film it is assumed that the viewer knows the basic stuff as they are not taugth here, only analyzed. The film covers handguns, shotguns and rifles, with the emphasis being on handguns.The main problem with this film is that the contents are not very visual, as the film is comprised mainly of Stanford speaking to the camera. There are some short action secuences as well, but over 80% of the length of the film comprises of this lecture. The things Stanford addresses are good, and I have nothing against that. The main gripe is that this film could have been published as a book, with a fraction of the price.Run time: 1:34"
2,Not Bola's Best,"i bought this CD based on the other reviews on Amazon & was very disappointed when i finally got it... i own 4 other Bola Sete CDs & this is easily my least favorite & will soon be for sale... i LOVE Bolas' music & guitar playing [see some of my other reviews] BUT this CD is not that music... much more ""new age"" sounding & dissonant than his other recordings... unless you're a collector of all of Bolas' recordings- i'd spend my money on his other recordings like ""Ocean Memories"" or ""Tour de Force""."
2,Warning! Not real Laguiloe that you know and love!,"I knew better than to order a set at this price, but hey... you never know. Now I do. I thought perhaps the first price was reflective of the sets quality--boy was I wrong. This set would never sell for 60 some dollars. Although the knives are useable (hence the 2 stars) they are NOT of good quality. The box is very flimsy and I wouldn't give this as a gift. If you want a knock-off go to TJMaxx or someplace and see these kind of knives for yourself before you buy. I'm going to save for some real Laguiole knives!"
4,Decent set for the right price.,"This set of knives is beautifull. They are sturdy and very well made. The price is well worth the product and I think it's a great value for the money. Let's face it most of the time you get what you pay for, These on the other hand defy that logic not by alot but defy it none the less. I would encourage anyone looking for a decent set of steak knives and arent willing to pay the big $$$, to pick these up. You won't be dissappointed."
2,Sucked into a sale,"I purchased these knives because they were on sale and we needed steak knives. Thank God they only cost me $. When I purchased them, I didn't care who made them; they looked nice in the picture & they were $! Well, honestly, they do look and feel VERY cheap know that I see and hold the real thing. Totally not worth $!!! The wood is not velvet smooth as I expected and even some of the nails (or whatever you call them) that secure the wood to the metal part of the handle stick out a bit. I've yet to see how they cut, but I can totally understand why those who paid $7are disappointed in the manufacture of these knives. If you sqint, they look very nice. Now I know why Amazon.com had them on sale."
1,Unfortunately Not the Real Deal,"I was really disappointed when I received these steak knives. I've used and purchased Laguiole knives in France, and unfortunately, these are nothing like the ones there. The ""wood"" looks incredibly fake. Either these are a cheap knock-off, or Sabatier has decided to make a cheap imitation of their own product in order to generate large volume sales. Really disappointing....."
2,6 for ...,"these knives are meant ot capitalize on the languiole name, a famous design of knife with pistol grips and a fold-in blade. .... the knives are ...imitations of the original thing. The blades are stamped stainless steel, and feature a serrated edge--heresy to a steak lover who cut meat, not tear it. the handles are small, and lightweight, there is almost no heft to it, and it feels like you are holding a ... plastic knife in your hands. it comes with a ... wooden tray."
2,Switchblade Steak Knives?????,Never would have bought them if I'd realized they looked like switchblade knives. Poor choice on my part....
1,"So bad, I had to write another review","Some how my previous review text got a little glitched up. But suffice it to say the only thing going for these knives is that the probably cut. The manufacture of these knives is well below the quality I expected .... It's the first time I;ve been TOTALLY disappointed .... We're returning the knives because they are not worth the money. Really, they look great in the picutre, but they are very poor quality. Why else would a four hundred dollar set be selling for twentysix dollars?"
3,Usable..........,A cheap imitation of the originals from France but they are useful. The wood handle and the shape is good looking. The originals are three times the price of these. I would buy another set or different types in this line because if you loose or brake one it is no big deal.........
2,already dead,"Ours is already dead. We bought per Cook's Illustrated recommendation. It started smoking after less than one year's use, and it is defunct. It was good while it lasted..."
5,Pretty Basic but does its job well,"This is a very simple product but what it does it does well. I like the ""pulse mode"" and the serrated blades to a better job of getting to the food than the previous blenders I have owned."
3,"Not great, not terrible","I don't understand why Cooks Illustrated recommended this blender so highly. I think it is average. It blends my banana smoothie drinks ok but I occasionally get a chunk or two. How hard is it to pulverize banana? It's incredibly loud. The blade assembly locked up after less than a year. I see others have mentioned this problem also, and a replacement is $17.50 from their website. If you don't notice that the blade has seized up, you will destroy the motor and have to buy a new blender altogether, which I think has happened to people based on their online reviews. Overall, I was expecting a nice blender because of the Cooks illustrated recommendation and received a very typical cheap blender."
2,"good blender, but cheap blade assemblies require frequent replacement","I've owned my Kalorik blender for a year and five months. It does a decent job blending. It handles ice and liquids better than smoothies. However, there is a serious issue is with the durability of the blade assembly. I've already gone through two assemblies -- they rust very easily, even though I don't leave them soaking, and I don't ever put them in the dishwasher. The blender also runs very loudly compared to other models I've had in the past.The only way to purchase replacement blade assemblies is through the manufacturer's web site, and you can expect to shell out about $17.50 including shipping for a replacement. That's a lot compared to the cost of the entire blender itself."
5,Blending in,"Not only is this product attractive, but it is efficient and easy to operate. It was also shipped and packed very carefully."
1,Terrible Blender and Customer Service,"We've been using our blender for a little over a year for smoothies, primarily. About 2 months ago the welding on the blades came undone and then this week it started spewing ball bearings and metal shavings. Plus it is obnoxiously loud. We tried to get a replacement product, given the fact that it could have actually damaged one of us with the metal shards and since it was only a year or year and half old, but the company said they would only fix it if we sent it in and, even then, we would have to pay for it to be repaired!! This was likely to cost more than a new product. I will never buy a Kalorik again. Jerks."
3,Entertaining!,"As other reviewers have noted, this is a great book. The writing is clear and vivid. Brings you into the PR environment and mentality. I gave it a lower rating because I found myself getting confused about which character was which, and had to go back and look up who was who more than once. It could be that the names were a bit too foreign and similar -- I've had that problem before, especially when reading Japanese and Indian mysteries, so I could just be me.I'm definitely going to buy more of the series, though. I hope he keeps writing."
5,Pewter Celtic Wall Cross,"Cross was even more beautiful than I expected, and was shipped promptly. Would definitely order from this vendor again."
2,Not worth $5.95,Babesiosis coinfection can exacerbate the symptoms of Lyme disease. It is important to diagnose babesiosis because treatments for the two infections are completely different. That's about all I got out of the article. I give it to you for free.
2,Flimsy clips,"I gave these two stars because they all snapped on our easel.. We don't technically have an Alex easel, my daughter's easel is the Ikea version (still a smaller easel, not as thick as Melissa and Doug), which is why I gave these two instead of one star. Definitely don't buy these thinking they will work for anything else."
2,PLASTIC! Not what I wanted,"I was expecting good old fashioned easel clips but in fun colors! I got cheap plastic clips. Not at all what I wanted. Alex brand used to be quality. I haven't used them yet so I can't honestly vouch for their durability, but they are plastic and do not look well made no matter what you want to use them for. I wish I had looked around in a local art supply instead. Now I will have to do that anyway. Should have realized it was too good to be true."
5,Very nice gun !!!,"You can not beat this new generation Milwaukee caulking gun for smoothness, power, long battery life, and designed -- it begs to be used ! I manage a Autoglass shop and my guys pump high viscosity urethane all day, any other gun would be punished to the max, not this one! I have used the older 2.4 volt Milwaukee guns for years and was happy, the 12 volt is 100 times better yet!"
5,no more sore hands,"I have a boat restoration business and do alot of caulking with very thick materials. For years I have used an air driven gun but no more. This far exceeds my expectations. ONly down side is heavier than an air gun, but no hose to worry about dragging in wet caulk on teak decks, battery holds a good charge and comes with a universal (milwaukee) charger. You can also buy a 14 volt battery for a 2nd one at Home Depot, and works with gun and charger."
3,Not a homeowner tool,"The three stars is just a warning, not a critique of the tool itself.This might be the right tool if you use a caulk gun for a living, but it's inappropriate if you just want to caulk the trim in your house.I've used caulk guns for 35 years and now have elbow tendonitis that makes it painful for me to grip and squeeze. After installing about a mile of crown moulding in my old house (using a Paslode finish nailer, before the tendonitis - now THERE'S a useful tool!), I wanted to caulk the gaps at the ceiling. This tool is heavy and a bit fussy for detail work when you're up on a ladder. Much better to let the elbow heal, wrap your forearm with the proper bandage and use a manual caulk gun. Or if it's a big honeydo job that can't wait, pay someone else to do it."
1,Just a way to try and sell their imaging products,"The book was terrible, it didn't really provide sample code that could be used for study or clean examples. Also it kept making a reference to products that needed to be licensed. There are much better books than this one, it was more like a product manual for their libraries and a complete waste at 50.00."
2,Expected more...,1. Pretty basic material.2. Too much code in place of text.3. Too much about Eikona3D.4. OK for beginners.
5,Perfect!,This sunshade fits my M45 perfectly! There is really no need to lower the sun visors to hold it in place like most generic shades. The temp drop versus other shades I have used in the past was noticebly cooler!
4,Just as described...,"The sunshade blocks all areas of the windshield just as described. The only flaw that I see is that it does not fold like many other sunshades. This shade rolls up from one side to the other. This can prove to be kind of a pain when taking the sunshade down, especially is you have a passenger in the car as it takes the entire width of the car to begin to roll it up. Overall though, it does what it says very well."
5,A masterful interpretation,"Eisenstadt's edition, comprising some of Weber's most famous essays on charisma and routinization and a stellar introduction, is one of the best points of entry into Weber's work out there. Along with Bendix, Shils, Schluchter, and Parsons (to a lesser degree), Eisenstadt is one of the most learned and systematic interpreters of Weber and an insightful sociologist in his own right. His introduction, which takes up a sizeable portion of the book, synthesizes and makes explicit some of the many possible connections available in the text, and is an excellent resource in and of itself."
2,Fun toy if you can keep it together,"My twin 4 yr old boys received this 3 days ago. It has spent more time apart than together, and they can not get the toy back together by themselves. We have Thomas and Geo sets with they take apart and put together 100 times a day, but not these. I thought these would be as durable as the Rescue Hero toys, but I was sadely mistaken. Oh well live and learn I guess."
3,Don't Buy It,"We received this as a gift and based on the positive reviews, we opened it up and put it together. My 4 year old son liked it for the first few days. It comes apart very easily and is frustrating for an adult to put it together the right way. The accessory pieces are very small and I feel are dangerous. I considered taking it back but the pieces were in seperate bags and there were too many to just stick in a box. My son does use some of the pieces to make tunnels that he uses for his Thomas trains, but other than that it is a waste. I never wrote review before but this was such a disappointment and waste, I felt compelled to let others know."
2,COMES APART EASILY!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"Comes apart too easily for a 3 1/2 year old. Constantly needs adult help to snap together. What a disappointment. It is ""going to the farm"" very soon! :("
4,Mom of 4 Yr Boy,My son loves this toy. He has had it for 6 months now and plays with it all the time. He loves to role play as the construction workers. I do agree that there are a lot of small pieces so I would not recommend it for a child under 3 (Neither does the manufacturer). We have not had problems with the pieces staying together as long as we play with it on a hard surface. It did not work very well on carpet.
2,Frustrating,"It won't stay together. You build a wall and start on the next wall and the first one falls apart. It's a great concept, it looks like it will be fun, IF we can ever get it to stay together long enough to play with it."
2,dissapointed,"We have had our coffee maker for a month and it has overflowed three times. We have had Braun Coffee Makers in the past and have not had this problem...ever. This one looks good, but can be a problem."
5,A great no frills coffeemaker,"If you are shopping for a no frills coffeemaker that brews good coffee, this Braun Coffeemaker is for you. We have owned it for almost three months and have had no problems whatsoever!I use the water filter and did a two-month filter change and flushing with vinegar because we have hard water which does tend to mess up the coffeemakers if you don't perform a periodic flushing to get rid of the sediments/calcifications."
3,Frustrating,"This coffee maker makes a good pot of coffee if you can catch it in the pot and it doesn't overflow all over the counter top. I've had this coffeemaker about 2 years now and it started out great, a good basic model. Then after about a year I began to have problems.The drain hole often refuses to open and coffee will then spill over into the top drain holes which allows the grounds and coffee to spill out all over the counter and some in the pot. I have replaced parts, but continue to have the problem.It is also impossible to get a cup of coffee during the brew cycle. The coffee just continues to drain all over the heating element.I like that it has a water filter and it is fairly easy to clean, but I am tired of having to watch it brew the coffee to prevent a major mess.I'm looking for a new coffee maker!"
1,Very Disappointing,"I purchased this model to replace an 8 year old version that finally died. The new model is cheaply built and the coffee is just passable. The plastic is thin and the basket closure does not seal tightly as with the older models. In order to get a decent cup of coffee, you need to use the gold filter basket AND put a paper filter into the machine. This is due to the water (which only comes out of one opening over the grounds) being pumped out too quickly. I do like a fast cup of coffee, but I've gone back to boiling water and pouring it over grounds in a strainer to get the flavor and body that I'm used to.Save your money and go with another brand."
3,It Drips......,"I bought this coffemaker to replace the Braun that I currently use. I wanted a Black coffemaker and I was happy with the Braun brand. I do not like how the carafe pours, seems it always spills. I also have to get used to the way the water tower opens, it's backwards in comparison to the one I already owned. Over all, I prefer the older Flavor Select. But this one looks FABULOUS on my counter."
2,Dissapointing Braun Performance,"Compared to a previous Braun Coffeemaker that we replaced the performance is poor. Thought they listed for the same price ($50), the former model had many features, which we did not use, except one. We had the ability to determine the automatic shutoff time, which is important to us. The new model has only a two hour shutoff. However, after a few weeks, the shutoff failed. The only reason that we replaced the old machine is that the Carafe broke and would have cost over $20 to replace it, so we opted for a new one. Bad choice."
3,Braun Coffee maker,"Fully satisfied with the function of theproduct except: The packing list called for a perm filter - no such thing was in the package. We understood this was original manufactured product, not a reconditioned one (misleading advertisement!)"
5,Great coffee maker!,Braun makes the BEST coffee makers. Twice as fast as a Mr Coffee and uses the much more desireable Melitta cone filters. You can purchase the pricey internal water filters but we just use pre-filtered water instead.
4,Makes Great Coffee.,"I bought this Braun coffeemaker recently because my husband was convinced that a cone shaped filter makes better coffee than the cupcake shaped filter. We already had a Mr Coffee coffeemaker that I was perfectly happy with. The Braun uses a cone shaped filter, while the Mr Coffee uses the cupcake shaped one. I tried coffee made with both coffeemakers and to my surprise, I could tell a difference. The Braun does make better, more flavorful coffee. The only thing that I don't like is that it only makes 10 cups of coffee while the Mr Coffee makes 12 cups. I couldn't find a 12 cup coffeemaker that uses cone shaped filters. Anyway, I am very happy with this Braun model."
1,Braun KF510-BK,"I'm disappointed in this coffee maker. Either the water passes thru the coffee too quickly giving a weakened taste (shouldn't happen w/ a milita filter system) or, worse yet, the carafe doesn't activate the 'trip' device and ""no"" water comes thruunless you stand there and monitor the flow. We've had a number of coffee floods. We love the styling, the grip and the ease of reading the water level...we just don't trust the system...wehave had Braun's in the past but this one's the pits!"
4,Braun Coffee Maker,"I wanted a coffee maker which was simple - no bells and whistles, except for the pause and serve feature (a real plus). I only gave the coffee maker four stars, since I do not have any experience with fancy coffee makers. Those may (or may not) brew a better cup of coffee, but I am more than satisfied with my recent purchase. Space was a big factor in my small kitchen, so I did not want a large coffee maker or one where the entire top covered the filter compartment and the water reservoir. The Braun's swing out filter compartment solved that problem. I really had to search for a coffee maker which met my needs. The Braun is perfect!!"
3,A few drawbacks,"I think I wish I had spent a little more money on a new coffee pot; didn't pay enough attention to features. This pot does not turn off automatically; the light stays red, does not turn green as others do after brewing. And as you're filling reservoir, the water drips quite a bit unless you hold the pot just so.Coffee itself is very good."
3,"Ok, but nothing special","I just bought this coffee maker--for even more than they're selling it on Amazon for!--and it's not horrible, but probably not worth the money. Every cup of coffee I've had so far has had grounds on the bottom of it. The taste is so-so, although it may be the coffee I'm using."
1,Functional,"This appliance is very easy to clean. I especially like the filter, no stains. Coffee is done in a jif. Sleek lines and convenient swing out basket for easy removal."
2,disappointed,"problem with overflow, handle is nice but very irratating to start the coffee and hear sizzling sounds coming from the caraff. Would not purchase this maker again and would highly recommend looking around at a higher grade of maker."
4,Just what I needed,"I wanted a coffeemaker with an on/off switch, that used cone filters and didn't cost over $50. This is just about the only one available and it's fine. The carafe doesn't pour well; coffee always escapes the spout when you pour a cup of coffee. That happened on our old Braun, so we were used to it."
3,not bad but could be better,I like the coffee but sometimes the pot leaks when you pour. I'm tired of wiping up either water or coffee from my counter top
3,CUTE :),I got this panda bear for my little nephew who was about 5months. He loves it! It's pretty small but very soft. I do wish it was a bit bigger though.
2,This might not be the phone you want.,"I bought this phone because it was cheap and because it got good customer reviews. I should not have put so much faith in the reviews. This phone has a shorter range than the 900mhz phone it was purchased to replace. The telezapper doesn't seem to do anything but make the phone beep when you answer a call. And, last but not least, the battery life on this phone is only about 15 minutes of talking on a fully charged battery. I am going to buy a new battery to see if that will fix that problem, but even if it does, I wish I would have followed the ""you get what you pay for"" saying."
2,Mediocre at best,"This product fails in its basic functions: sound quality is very poor, and battery life is low. However, the Telezapper does work.So, if you want a Telezapper-phone that can't be used as a phone because of poor performance, this is the item for you."
1,Bad Battery; Terrible Telephone,"I bought this phone from Amazon a few months ago. I had to turn off the Telezapper feature within a couple of weeks because it was so annoying and distracting to personal callers. The phone constantly picks up interference, I personally don't care for any of the ring options, and the battery just plain sucks. At a couple months old, a full night of charging is good for about 20 minutes of use before the thing starts beeping at me and cutting out parts of my conversation.Skip this piece of junk and sign up for your state's no-call list instead."
2,zaps telemarketers & messages,"I was very hopefull with this product purchase a week ago. I read the manual thoroughly, as most electronics require. I like the feature of ""zapping"" predictive dialers, but the fact is, when the tone comes across the phone line, my digital answering machine thinks someone is picking up the line and shuts off. That means, if someone were to call, it would ring 4 times and ""zap"", then cut off. How effective is this really?"
3,"Good phone, very poor battery life","I have the same problem as the other reviewers with a very poor battery life. After hours of recharging, it allows approx 20 minutes of use. Searching for a new new battery and will see how it goes..."
1,Stay away from this phone,"Poor battery life, poor reception, and it broke after 8 months of regular home use. Go Uniden instead..."
2,"crappy battery, otherwise ok",like some of the other reviewers i have had a real problem with this battery. it literally lasts 20 minutes after a full 24 hours charging. i havent yet tried replacing the battery but i've only had the thing for 6 months so far and already it's dying? anyway i would recommend NOT buying this one.
5,"Goodbye Telemarketers, Hello peace and quiet!","It really works! As a homeowner with a two month old, we'd finally had enough of those irritating ""unknown"" callers. Everyone was selling everything! The Telezapper stopped the phone calls with ""no one on the line"", the hang ups, and the solictations (let the answering machine pick up & they get ZAPPED!). We saw a difference within a few days and were so pleased! It is reducing those computer dialed calls every day! This is a winner in our home and we've purchased them for Christmas gifts!!! BYE BYE SOLICITORS! More time for baby and peace & quiet!"
2,Too much static,"Tried two different one. Took the first one back because of poor reception. Got another, same problem. Walked 25 feet away from the base, and arond a corner and got nothing but static. Tried it in different phone jacks and got the same results.Going back to the drawing board."
1,The May Fly Phone,"This phone has a vampiric quality of sucking the life force out of me, on top of from the power grid, and using it for a standout fifteen minute lifespan. It is the May fly of battery life, beautiful in its impermanance but useless as a telecommunications tool. Maybe it could be used as bait for an elusive trout."
3,It's Not THAT Bad!,"Yes, the bags are small. They aren't difficult to find at least in my area. The suction is great as I use the crevice tool to pick up golden retriever fur along the baseboards. It also effectively takes cat hair off of my living room furniture. I wish the hose were longer. If you like gadgets and light weight portablity it's fine."
2,Think first before you buy this one.,"I've used all kinds of vacuums for decades so I know a bit about them. This one is high maintenance - you have to get bags and filters, frequently. Availability of accessories is limited to Internet and authorized dealers. Works fine on bare floors but doesn't do much for deeper pile carpet. Plus side - light weight and compact design. Very good for bare floors and thin carpet but not for anything else. Useful for light clean up."
4,Convenient,Convenneint to carry around in my wallet. Know i will use these repeatedly so bought many of them. WOuld buy again.
2,I bought an upscale product?,"Within 2 weeks, the pause & brew didn't exist. The coffee poured all over when I tried to pull the carafe for a cup. My attempts at fixing it were for naught. What a waste of money! I'm not one who returns items. I just won't buy Braun again!."
5,Great Hot Coffee!,"A great combination of premium and budget coffee makers. It brews great coffee b/c it brews hot, and it is super simple to operate. The carafe works well, though if you poor too much at one time, it will spill a bit. But this is generally not a problem. Also, directions for clock/automatic settings is printed conveniently on the inside of water reservoir lid."
4,"Easy, Stylish, and makes great coffee!","After seeing all the great reviews about this maker I decided to check it out and buy one. My last maker was a Krups and though it did last for several years it just went hay wire on me one day.Well, I love the quality of this machine and the only small complaint is that I think the coffee could be made a little more HOT! If you like lots of cream in your coffee like I do you may be a little disappointed with what results in your morning Cup O'Joe. Guess you could always take that extra step and nuke it. Otherwise this is a great product!"
2,Just Stopped Working & Not Even 1 Year Old!!!!,"I loved this coffeemaker, until it just suddenly stopped working and it isn't even 1 year old!! Previous coffeemakers I owned have lasted years and years. I expect more from a coffeemaker that cost over $[...]+. Now I have to find the warranty card and go through all that hassle. I am NOT a happy customer."
3,Not for the 1 and 2 cup crowd,"I purchased this unit after reading another review saying it won some award for best tasting coffee. I thought that I would like that the coffee is hotter than my old Black & Decker unit, except it is so hot the coffee tastes scalded to me. Also, using the same Star Bucks coffee as in my previous unit, the coffee produced comes out quit silty. I only make 2 cups at a time and think it may produce a better cup if one were making a 6,8 or 10 cups. The only postive I can think of is it is aesthetically pleasing."
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Braun","This was purchased as a replacement for my 16-year old Braun. I LOVE the new style and it brews as well. It's a bit more compact than my older model, and brews fabulous coffee. I would buy it again and again. But I don't expect to have to buy another one for a long time since this appliance line has longevity! It does come with a Brita filter which I don't use - we have fabulous water in this area - but it's a nice option if you need to use filtered water."
2,Not worth the money,"I have owned this coffee maker for about a month. It is just a coffee maker, and no more. The coffee is not hot enough for my tastes, and there are virtually no features worth discussing except that it has the swing away basket which makes it easy to fill with coffee. I am truly disappointed in this product."
3,Not the Best,"This coffee maker leaves a lot to be desired. The coffee is not as hot as I would like it to be. The old Braun coffee makers were far superior to this one. It does not have the functions of the old ones, where you could set the strength. It also does not have an alert to tell you coffee is finished or that the pot is shutting off. I am somewhat disappointed in this coffee maker."
3,"Good, but not as good as previous models","This is a competent coffee maker, but not as good as the previous generation of Brauns. The pot is smaller - 10 cups vs. 12 - and construction is not as robust as the previous model. That said, it makes very good coffee. It's reliable, consistent, and a good buy."
3,It's ok but not great.,"I bought this coffee machine to replace my old Braun 10 cup machine.Good things: I wanted to get the programmable timer, which is nice. The machine brews coffee very quickly and it is nice and hot, hotter than my old machine. The button which makes the filter basket swing out is fun to use and the carafe has a nice feel to it. It's also relatively easy to get the carafe in and out without the filter basket getting caught on it, which I notice is a problem with a lot of coffee makers that have a pause-and-serve feature.Bad things: The coffee it brews is weaker than I expect and I have to add more grounds than I did with my old machine. Also, it's kind of expensive for being imperfect and for the price of the carafe alone you can buy a whole new coffee machine."
2,Not what I expected from Braun,"This coffeemaker is a huge disappointment! The stop when you remove the coffee pot rarely works, when pouring coffee the lid is not well made so coffee spills everywhere, and if you do not use additional paper filters, you get coffee grains. In summary, a huge mess everytime you make a pot of coffee. The plus? the water filter, but that is it!"
1,Make sure u have....,"Before you purchase the saw, make sure you investigate the cost of the batteries and where they can be purchased. I'm Having a time trying to find the correct ones to fit. All Milwaukee batteries do not interchange with each other. The best reason to purchse is to repalce the saw."
1,Very uneven toaster,"Based on the previous reviews we purchased this toaster, primarily because the slots accommodate bagels. It looks OK and reasonably well made, though the gray components are a rather flimsy plastic. But what a disappointment! This is the most uneven toaster we have ever experienced. The problem seems to be the outer heating elements. The inner elements (in the center between the two slots) are the typical flat metal filaments. However the outer element (on the outboard side of each slot) is a single ceramic rod about a 1/2"" in diameter, which is positioned horizontally in the lower third of the slot. So, if you toast something long enough to give it some color you will find the lower half is dark while the upper half is virtually untouched. We sent it back."
1,HIGH PRICE+HIGH EXPECATIONS =BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I bought this because of using a Rowenta iron for a few years and knowing that the extra $ for it was well spent. Also, after reading reviews from this site and reading its high ratings from other people who had purchased it. If we don't have a defective one then everybody who gave a 4 or 5 rating is insane!! I bought the new one because my girlfriend was tired of the one I owned for 10 years and I thought Rownta would make a bombproof unit like their irons. It is the most uneven toaster I have ever used. I could care less if we paid $15-20 that would be expected but considering their price no way. I'm in the process of returning, I'm going to try to get another one and see if it was faulty but I'm not holding my breath. They need to stick to irons, diversifing is diworsifing."
4,Nuting But De Stone,"It is very original. He is an uprising talent that will go places. The music keeps to his roots yet explores, the new hip hop Ragga style."
2,Camco Grill returned 2nd time,Received second grill and this one had the same missing parts. NO HANDLES. Don't think they can send me a COMPLETE PACKAGE WITH ALL THE PARTS. Will return this 2nd shippment. Also you are not showing receiving my first grill as be returned.
1,Hole in the Unit!,When I recieved this product in the mail (FedX) the box looked okay. There were no inducations that there was damage. When I opened the box and started to put the unit together I noticed a hole in the lower front! Now the grill will not heat to max as there is too much air flow! Too bad I had one of these grills before and it lasted for 9+ years.
1,Worst Portable grill,"Very slow to heat but after three years totally unfit for use. Difficult to light. Once lite it often blows out. Legs are awkward to put away, They flop down while trying to put away in the vinyl bag as there is no retainer to keep them in the stored position. This one is ready for the trash and I am ready to upgrade to the Made in USA Weber Q series"
3,Camco 57301 Olympian RV 4100 tabletop grill,"Identical grill to the one we had for 10 years or so, however--this one does NOT heat near as well as the old one. It takes much longer to cook. What are we doing wrong? We are hooked to a small propane canister (that we used with the old one), but it doesn't have any real ""heat."" Do we need to use a larger canister or--??It is also hard to light."
2,Not the Best,"This camera is not so great. I received it as a present some years ago, so I can't really complain all that much. It's getting rather old anyhow, as far as cameras go that is.Positives:--It takes pictures.Negatives:--The camera itself is fairly bulky.--The photos generally turn out pretty bad. Many of them have large lines running through them.--It takes the camera quite a long time to turn on and then it beeps for a while.--Batteries get the life sucked out of them. The batteries it came with couldn't even keep the camera on long enough for it to stop beeping and let me take a picture.--The date and time is printed on every picture in large, orange font and it resets itself every time the batteries are taken out. I have so many pictures with the year 2055 printed on them and can't figure out how to remove the date.Overall I would recommend you not to buy this camera, but that's up to the buyer."
4,Good Stuff.,"Magnus is off on another adventure, this time via Norse Mythology. On the way, he picks up another companion, Alea (to replace Dirk). Much romantic potential there, and it's about time! Stasheff has been hinting about it for several books now. The world he has created is quite interesting, though the plot is similiar to the rest of the series. But then who really cares, since it's all great fun anyway!"
1,just a guy,"Christopher Stasheef is an excellent writer and has taught me alot. However this book demonstrates that even the best have an off day. The Wizard undertakes to reform a slave society, A laudable idea. What really happens is that the author pulls from his hat a solution that doesn't quite fit. It resembles a mystery where the sluth withholds evidense from the reader and suddenly the suspect is revealed. I won't ruin this book for you, but it is far from this great mans best effort."
1,blech.,"I didn't like it because I don't like the idea of Magnus getting a girlfriend. After all, the idea of him wanting one in the first place is preposterous, since he's been totally warped by bad past experiences. I rather liked that there was a male character out there who didn't chase after women, and seemed to be terminally single. Romance ruins the story."
4,"Nice work overall, just one thing...","I have had my Xbox less than a week, and I must tell you, I am impressed...I love sport and wrestling games, and have owned NBA Live since the Sega Genesis days, and was looking forward to the gameplay, being a PS one owner...I got everything I was looking for...graphics, gameplay, etc...except for the ONE thing that haunts EVERY NBA LIVE addition, whether Sega Genesis, Playstation, or even XBOX...WHY WON'T THE USER TEAM REBOUND!!! It is ridiculous to find that no matter how or who I box out, shooting guards are rebounding over Mutumbo and O'Neil...????? If this one oversight could be CORRECTED, I would have a complete gaming experience..."
4,Good Game...Few Problems,"NBA Live 2002 is a pretty good game for XBOX. The graphics are great, the Alley-oop button is cool and gameplay is simple once you get used to it.There are a few problems though:1. It is difficult to save and load files.2. Trading and creating players is hard.3. Shooting a mid-range shot is impossible. The entire point of this game is dunking. Every once and a while you will hit a shot or a 3, but not very often.4. The computer is not good enough. In most games, the computer is too hard, but in this one it's too easy. I have won every game that I played even on the All Pro level.This is a good game."
3,"Electrifying dunks, but lacks realism","Graphics are unmatched, but this game lacks a real NBA flavor. Sure Vince Carter is a great athlete, but does he really put the ball through his legs when he is in mid-flight of a dunk...in traffic? I like the detail EA Sports has taken with the signature shoes, and the tatoos, but that is where the realism stops. If you like Arcade style of play, this game is for you. You will enjoy the numerous animations of dunks and reverse layins. If you like a real simulation, you might be disappointed. The defense is week and I find myself scoring over 130 points a game, even at the ""super-star"" level. I'm hoping for a basketball game to really step out. Maybe it will be NBA2K2?"
5,This game is awsome!!,"This game should be the best basketball game to date! EA Sports is rebuilding their engine and they have been working over a year in this game. If you're a sports fan, then this is a MUST have in your collection."
4,Its ok,The game has great graphics and all but the truth is that NBA 2k2 is the best basketball game to date. Also NBA Live games have been known for a delay when you press the button. If your a real basketball fan get NBA 2k2 for xbox when it comes out. NBA live is the second best.
2,BOREING!!!! Id rather be in class,"Maybe I expected to much because i brought fever, halo, and gotham first. Compared to those games this game bites its slow boreing and dull. Somebody please tell me how anthony peeler can stop T-mac on fast break. HMMM. give me a break EA I want my money back. I hope inside drive is better because it cant e any worse.If you have this game sell it and buy 2k2.EA [is bad] on xbox I hated madden and i hated live but XBOX still rules.Dont waste your [$] on this one if you just have to buy it buy it used and then sell it back again."
2,What Is the Stiffness Factor Run all of the EA Sports Games,I have this game and its players are stiff just like Madden 2002 i guess it runs in the family the graphics surpass the PS2 version and the Instant Replays are excellent but those are the only thing good about this game if I could I would it 2.5 Stars.
2,Wait for Sega NBA2k2,"This game look Great and that's were the fun stops. I was hoping for faster game play and was totally unhappy.It's just to slow even on fast brakes. I like the feature where player get tired and you can't just sprint up and down the court forever, but it's seems to me the speed of the NBA is not felt.I need the game to be quicker to make it more competive. I hope this is not the way the system is set to access the net. If so it's not worth it. Bring back the speed!!!Don't know what I'm talking about. Play Sega's NBA 2k1 and watch how you loose youself."
1,how do you compare to inside drive,the game was so slow poorly graphics bad game play. inside drive is the only game i know you actually can shoot the ball and make in the basket. others all you can do is dunk. you cant even rebound the ball.
2,Wait for NBA Inside Drive 2002,"I was greatly dissappointed when I popped this game into my Xbox. The play was choppy, not smooth at all and far too slow. At times, the players looked cartoon-like. If I were you I would wait for NBA Inside Drive 2002, which comes out on January 22nd. This looks like a much better game and should prove to be so. People are saying that NBA Live 2002 is better than 2001. Its true, but not by much, plus, 2001 really really stunk! Wait for Inside Drive 2002!"
3,What were they thinking?,"I just bought x-box a few weeks ago and have only payed 2 games. ""Max Payne"" (which is exellent) and NBA Live2002. NBaLive is very dissapointing. The Play is slow. It's next to impossible to get a rebound on the defensive end. I've had the other team get 10-11 rebounds in a row many times and this is with 3 or 4 of my guys under the basket and only one of the other teams players. Not to mention smaller players out rebounding Bigger players. This game is where the Complaints about the x-box controls come in. The buttons are 2 close. When i want to jump i end up pushing someone. when i want to make a steal i end up jumping. Did i mention play was slow? When you do make a quick move to the basket don't expect to dunk or shoot right away. I always have to push the shoot button 3 or 4 times.It's an Ok game to play if you're bored but IMO save your money and Buy something like ""Max Payne"""
3,Mediocre compared to other NBA games on XBOX,"EA's NBA Live 2002 is mediocre at best when compared to other NBA offerings on the XBOX, such as Microsoft's NBA Inside Drive 2002, or SEGA's fantastic NBA 2K2. EA needs to do some serious work on their basketball game if they want to compete with the new pros! Not recommended - Go for SEGA's NBA 2K2 instead."
2,yawn...,"Im VERY glad I rented this game before I bought it. Im really dissappointed in EA. Madden 2002, NHL 2002, and F1 2001 are all very good games. I was hoping for the same in their NBA game. After playing a season of NBA 2K1 on my rommate's Dreamcast last year, I was expecting to have my jaw dropped by this game. The camera angles were poor at best. The controls weren't all that. The only thing that saved this game at all was the 1 on 1 play. But the terrible music that was playing there ruined that, too! After renting this game, I will be renting ALL games before I buy them. It just goes to show that even the great EA can come out with a dud. I returned the game after the first night and got NHL 2002 again. THATS a fun game. THIS is not."
1,Worst basketball game I have ever played!!,"First I want to say that I love my XBOX. But I wasted my money on this basketball game. It was terrible, there were 3 things that I hate about the game, I don't like the controls of the game, the game is hard to use. when your playing the guys don't rebound, and the other one is the guys look to much like cartoons. I don't even play the game. I am going to wait for NBA inside drive, it looks allot better, I recommend everyone wait for that."
1,ARE THESE PEOPLE STUPID?,"you have got to be kidding me, how can this game be getting all these great reviews. this is quite possibly the worst b-ball game i have ever played (next to espn nba tonite). Nba live 98 is seriously better than this. this cant compare to nba 2k2 on any level. the gameplay is horendous. the graphics are horendous. the concepts are horendous. Please buy nba 2k2 instead of this. the people giving this a good rating must have been hired by EA sports or something. Trust me, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
2,Dont waste your money,To all fans of Basketball games on Consoles.....Do not buy...i repeat....do not buy this game.....wait for NBA 2k2 from SEGA.I got this game as a gift for christmas. I played the game one time and i honestly thought it was a joke. The game play is slow as can be and i personally thought it was difficult to control the players. I had the dreamcast and loved their NBA series. IF the xbox is so much stronger than the sega then why is NBA 2k1 for sega a 10 times better game. If i were a basketball gaming fan i would rent the game before i buy it. All i can say is buyer beware and i told you so. Just wait on NBAK2k2
2,A unrefined game.,"The problem about this game is that there is no defense, which means that the only thing that you can do is drive in with the turbo button, then dunk. *sucks.* YOu can roast the AI doing this. Bleg."
2,wheres the Defense,"well i've been probably one of the biggest NBA live fans from NBA Live 95 on SNES to current....but wow, this was not very goodgraphics and stuff are whatever, they dont really matter ALL that much in a basketball gamecrossover and 'stutter step', theres no stutter...umm, and the worst thing about the game, there's no defensei was playing it at a friends place and even a person who's never played a basketball game could possibly score on every posession...theres no DEFENSE played by the computer and it is very hard to play defense as a userholla"
4,A little more to it,"This game is so far really good. But the thing about this is that, like most people say, is the defense. It is pretty bad. but if you want a basketball game that is good, get this."
4,"Great game, but not much change from past versions.",The only thing different from past version is this game is more high flying jam it in you face dunks. Great graphics and fun to play. It is very hard to shoot the 3 in the more difficult levels and the game has not adopted the new rules in the NBA. If your a first timer to the NBA live series you will love this game. If you have own previous versions you will not be impressed because most of the game features and play are the same. One thing I do love about this game is you can make lesser players better by editting thier stats. I love this because I can use the guys I like and still have a good team in a season.
3,It's a very slow pace game,"Even with the turbo boost on, the players seem to move very slow. If playing against the computer it is nearly impossible to beat it, even by playing in the easy setting."
5,An excellent album,"I almost didn't buy this album after read some of the negative reviews here on Amazon. I assumed that ""Estrella de mar"" was their one good album. I can truly say that this is one of the few bands that does not have a bad song on any album. This album is excellent, despite what you read in other reviews. If you don't own ""Estrella de mar"", buy that first. But make this the second Amaral album in your collection. A great album!Casi no me compré este álbum después de leer algunas de las reseñas negativas aquí en Amazon. Asumía que ""Estrella de mar"" era su único álbum bueno. De verdad digo que éste es uno de los pocos grupos que no produce ni una sola mala canción en ningún álbum. Este disco es excelente, a pesar de lo que lees en otras reseñas. Si no tienes ""Estrella de mar"", cómpratelo primero. Pero este disco debería de ser el segundo álbum de Amaral en tu colección. ¡Un álbum genial!"
3,"Not bad, but they can do much better than this","OK I guess for those who like plain pop based on rock instrumentation (guitar, bass, drums). There are a few good hooks here and there but a major problem with this release is that the sound is generally flat and most of the songs sound pretty much the same. Thus the general replay value of the disc is low. Hopefully in the next album, Aguirre will show us how much in love he is with senorita rock'n'roll and hardens substantially the sound of the band. These guys have the chops to give much more than this."
3,She still sings fantastic!,"I love her voice, but I definitly miss her singing with the ""La Oreja De Van Gogh"" I tend to find that almost every song she mention how much she is missing someone, so I do not see much variety in her music, is kind of always the same thing to me. I hope she brings something new."
1,What a Disappointment !,"The legendary Laguiole name drew me to this product. I collect pocket knives and corkscrews and know fine workmanship so I could not believe my luck when I saw this product offered at a bargain basement price. Well, once again, price reflects the quality. The ""worm"" feels flimsy and doesn't seem like it's going to last. The first time I opened a bottle, it was difficult to get the screw started. Also, the lever is too wide to easily attach to the lip of a wine bottle - a very strange design indeed. I have a 30 year old ""lever"" or waiter corkscrew I bought at the old Hoffritz for Cutlery in the Port of Authority terminal in NYC. It has opened a heck of a lot of bottles and its design is light years ahead of this one. I also have a $5.00 cork screw I just bought at a Winery in Tuscany and it blows the doors off this baby. Maybe you should go to a store and check the design out before buying. You will probably make a different purchase. It came in a pretty box, though!"
1,Save your money,"I purchased this as a gift for a friend at Xmas. For the money I paid, I wasn't expecting fireworks. However, I WAS expecting the thing not to BREAK APART the first time it was ever used. I really am not concerned with the Laguiole name; the thing costs under $30 after all. I just wanted a decent corkscrew to give as a gift. Embarrassing."
1,Dumbfounded,This was an item that I thought would be a great to have on the restaurant floor but I was wrong. The first time I tried to cut the foil on a bottle of wine it would not cut. I was dumbfounded. When I tried to open a bottle of San Pelligrino I broke off the top portion of the bottle because the bottle opener would not properly fit on there. It launched half way across the room. This corkscrew was not useful at all. I would buy a real Laguiole not a imitator such as this.
3,What a let down,"3 stars instead of 2 because the graphics are unlike anything I have seen before, and I believe may lead to other games in that style, which will be a good thing. Cell Damage is just way too monotous for me, and I have play some ""sameold same old level after level"" games before. This is not quite even up to those. The weapons are rediculous, to the point where you don't battle, you tap and kill. I like battles, and this didn't have it. I thought this would be more like Interstate 76 or Interstate 82 on PC, and was let down so badly. I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Rent it or find a playable demo disc, sure, but don't spend [amt] on this."
3,ok game but not too impressed,"Eh, where to begin with this one... mostly I don't like it because of it being related like a twisted metal game, which I hate those kinda games. The controls are ackward and just sometimes out of the way, the schme is basicly destory everything... wow. For you diehard Twisted Metal fans this is your game, if not, rent before purchase."
3,"Graphics are okay, but the gameplay is horrible.","After about a half hour into the game, i realized that I kept dying too easily. There are no defensive weapons at all, so it's just a game of ""kill as much as you can before you die"" The gameplay is horrible, and the characters have no personality."
5,GREAT GIFT,"THIS IS THE TIWSTED MEATLE FOR XBOX .THE CHARTERS ARE REAL COOL LIKE SINDER,AND VOILET.THE GAMEPLAY IS COOL WITH LEVELS THAT LOOK LIKE THEY CAME RIGHT OUT OF A CARTOON. BUT ONE THING I WILL COMPLAIN ABOUT IS HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE U TO BEAT IT. FOR ONE THERE IS A LEVEL WERE YOU HAVE TO GET 500 SMACKS BEFORE ANYONE TO WIN. BUT OVERALL THI IS A MUST FOR XBOX"
2,Not Backwards Compatible,I bought the game and recieved it in a timely manner.It came with the origaonal case and was in good shape. Unfortonately it is not backwards compatible with the xbox360. Since i don't have the origonal xbox anymore i can't play the game. It was a big dissapointment.
3,The Fun Is a Five...The Game Is A Three,Cel Damage is one of the funnest games to grace XBOX. The steup is fun and the characters are unique.But the game itself isn't one I'd play too long. I'm not a fan of this game that much.Recommended if you have a group of friends and need light hearted fun.
5,a real good game!!!!,This is a great game in my opinion. The graphics are great and the weapons are awesome. If your looking for a game that never gets old get this one. I have tons of games including halo and this is my favorite. This game doesn't get old like those other ones. This game is perfect for kids to adults. This is the only game i play hardly because i got bored of all the rest. So buy this game i definately recommend it.
2,Yawn.,"I really did NOT like this game. The vehicles were very hard to control and I would frequently get beeyotch-slapped from out of nowhere. The graphics are cool, but this game got old - FAST. Already sold my copy."
4,Great but not the best,"This game is very fun with great graphics and sound. However, it's very difficult and can get you frustrated."
2,Not Twisted Metal,"The graphics are great but the gameplay is terrible. Its just not fun. Unlocking different levels is mildly amusing, but once you are done with that there is little else. The multiplayer is much the same. If you want great multiplayer get halo."
4,Not perfect - but close,"I love this tool. It stores in places where my 12"" speed square can't fit.I agree with other reviews. there is a likelihood that it will lose it's perfect square. That is always true with any tool that pivots. But I find correction is simple and I only worry about it when the measurement is critical.What I like best is the little rim that rides the board. A regular square doesn't have that and you have to align the top edge with the top of the board. By the time you draw your square line, it has shifted and you start all over.This tool hasn't completely replaced my speed square, but I haven't used my framing square since I bought this."
4,"Well written, entertaining novel","Exciting and well written. The main characters are likable and believable. Those with a medical background will be distracted by some annoying glitches that could have been ironed out if any physician had read the book prior to publication. (Medical students are paid and get to pick their classes, for example.)"
5,The Beachcomber's Handbook of Seafood Cookery,"An unusual approach to a cookbook. Tells you how to catch it or buy it, clean it and cook it with humorous stories to bring it alive (the book not the seafood!) The book is delightfully illustrated by renowned artist Claude Howell giving this cookbook a different look. This cookbook is a must for your kitchen whether you are the cook or not. It is such a shame that it is no longer in print. It was my favorite gift for every newlywed couple I knew."
5,A Classic Movie,"A classic movie that should never be lost in the shuffle of time. Okay, this is a really stupid, silly movie but it's a great stupid movie. If you don't find this movie funny at least a little bit you must be dead."
3,cute,This is just a cute movie - good for the family and not bad on acting and effects. One of the better B movies full of fun.
4,A classic Monday-night movie!!,"This movie doesn't intend to save the world, it just wants to tell a fairy story about how an ordinary mom and dad did. This movie is best on a Monday night when the trip back to work has depleted your brain cells. Just sit back and prepare to laugh. PS - the scene with the light grenade is a scream!"
3,Comic book comes to life,While Teri Garr is worth watching for any reason she shines in this video because you can tell she and her fellow actors didn't take the plot serious and therefore had fun. This is a perfect movie to watch when you want to be entertained and not preached to.
3,A Creative Comedy Film,"I enjoy this far-fetched science-fiction film. This film looks like it had made last minute and the writer is obviously very creative in the last minute. But the story has the love, war and win-win at the end. The car flying in to the space is very unique with a smallest planet out of our solar system where is other aliens living. It's fun to watch and kill time when you travel."
3,LIKE A LIVE ACTION CARTOON,"MOM AND DAD SAVE THE WORLD is really something like a live action Saturday morning cartoon. It's hopelessly silly but admittedly fun at times. Jeffrey Jones and Teri Garr star as Dick and Marge Wilson, who are whisked away to the planet of Spingo by its narcissistic king played with unabashed ham by Jon Lovitz. The planet is ""a planet full of idiots"" and all its inhabitants live up to it. Seems Lovitz wants Garr for his Queen and then plans on destroying Earth so his planet can be the greatest in the universe. Eric Idle has fun playing the vanquished king before Lovitz, and Wallace Shawn steals his brief scenes. It's pretty childish fun, but some of the creatures are cute and if you just want silly entertainment, this fits the bill."
1,I would give it a negative if I could,"This was by far one of the WORST movies I have ever seen! The plot was nonexistant, the dialogue was unbelievably childish, and the whole purpose was unknown, like hello? was there a purpose? This movie was horrible, I want the scriptwriter and producer tortured untli they can write their way out of a paper bag. Who gave the go ahead on this monstrosity?"
1,"The more I read this book, the more I disliked it","I have become addicted to self-help books, but I really didn't like this book. I read the book half way and then stopped. I really wanted to see what I could get from the book, but the more I read it the more I hated it. It is a bunch of individual stories and is promoting psychics' business. It emphasizes on reincarnation. I don't think all religions believe in that philosophy. It went against everything I believe in. If anyone wants it for free, I can mail it."
3,"the coffee is fine, but it's the water filters","I cannot find replacement Brita replacement filters, so it's very disappointing I will have to go back to using vinegar again. In fact, Brita says they never manufactured them! Go figure."
1,Bad Coffee!!,"The cool thing about this machine is that it brews coffee real fast. The problem is that it makes horrible coffee, especially if you only want to make a few cups."
2,Great looks . . . poor coffee,"I purchased this model to replace a five-year-old basic Krups machine that stopped working. This coffeemaker is beautifully designed and has an ideal combination of features, but the coffee it makes doesn't have the deep, rich flavor I had experienced with the old Krups. The water flows through quickly in a continuous stream and isn't in contact with the grounds very long. After two weeks of adjusting the amount of coffee, I gave up and purchased a Krups Procafe II."
1,weak coffee; brews too fast,"I agree that this coffee maker brews coffee too fast. For 6 cups of coffee I need to use 6 heaping tbsp of coffee, where in my previous coffee maker I could get by with 3 or so. My wife also noticed that the coffee was very weak the first time she used this coffee maker. So maybe we'll use it just when we have company, but for now I guess I'll keep using the free 4-cupper that I got with Gevalia coffee several yrs ago."
2,"Pay a little, get a little.","The first time I used it the on-button would not stay on. Easily resolved, just returned it for a new machine. After 3 months the heat plate is chipping. Heat plate is painted black and a great deal of the silver metal is now showing through which I feel is poor quality.What can I say. It's only $50 and it brews a very hot but average tasting cup of coffee."
1,This coffee turns off after 15 minutes!!!!!!!,"Maybe I have a default, but after the coffee is made, it starts ticking after just 15 minutes then shuts off. I thought maybe that was the way it shuts off and kept warm. It doesn't. Unfortunately I threw the box away. Never again..."
2,Not up to Braun's Traditional Standards,"We have used Braun's better model (was called the FlavoSelect) for many years. We chose this model because we make coffee only once a day now, and usually no more than 6 cups.In every way, this new model does not look, feel, or perform up to Braun's traditionally very high standard. I certainly would not trade it for Mr. Coffee or anything else I've seen on the retail shelves. But it is just less than we expected from Braun."
2,Too hot: wrecks beans,"If you're a serious coffee drinker and can get top quality beans (like Peet's) stay away from this machine. It has the worst possible fault in a coffee-maker: the water is too hot. It's not very much too hot, but the oils in coffee are so volatile than being over maybe two degrees can wreck a good cup. I've encountered this problem before: I think Americans still think coffee should be ""hot"" like in the percolator days. It shouldn't be. Anyway this one went back right away (always a plus with Amazon) and I'll keep my old, stained Braun in action until I find a better replacement. (If you're not particular I suppose it does everything else fine and it is pretty.)"
2,Horribly weak coffee,"We were very happy with our previous Braun coffee maker, so when it finally died on us after years of faithful service, we naturally bought this updated model. Unfortunately, the new system now pumps water through the grounds so fast that the coffee comes out extremely weak (if you can see through your coffee, it's too weak). The only solution we've found so far is to grind the coffee really fine, but that makes for muddy coffee. We're fed up and going to get a new one - not a Braun this time! Don't buy this coffee maker if you appreciate good, strong coffee."
1,Don't buy it - filters cost more than the coffee maker!,"This is my third Braun coffee maker in 20 years, which demonstrates Braun's reliability and my loyalty. HOWEVER learn from my mistake - when I purchased this unit two years ago, the filters were inexpensive. Now they are very hard to find and third party sellers are price gouging. Read the reviews on the filters and run screaming - use your own filtered water and avoid this model.Braun + Brita = price gouging - SHAME on you both."
5,Tastes great!,"After having tried a number of different coffeemakers this one is really good, no unnececessary bells and whistles and yes, the coffee does taste better with the water filter. At this price it's a really good deal."
2,What happened to Braun?,"The coffeemaker worked fine for 1 year and 4 months and then the 2-hour shut-off feature commenced to turning off mid-perk. It could be restarted, but stopped the machine again and again. This coffeemaker should have lasted a very long time, and I am disappointed. I've had Brauns that lasted until I had beaten them into ugliness, but they never stopped working."
3,Weak coffee makes this a big disappointment,"I was excited when I opened the box and saw this really neat design - the coffeemaker looks great. But when I eagerly prepared a pot of coffee this morning, the results were completely disappointing. Coffee was weak and pale in color, not at all what I would expect from a Braun product. I will be returning this for a refund and will look for a coffeemaker (at this price, or less!) that will give me dependably strong coffee right from the start."
3,Braun coffeemaker,I am not pleased with this product due to its inability to cut off automatically. Within 4 months after purchase it stopped working properly and repeatedly clicks until I cut it off manually. Very aggrivating!
2,weak coffee,"While the overall design of the maker is great -- the carafe pours without dripping, parts remove and fit well, and it looks great -- the new ""fast brew"" system pushes the water through much too quickly, resulting in a very weak cup of coffee. Even putting in more beans than usual did not help improve the coffee to our liking. If you like your coffee strong, as I do, I would highly recommend against any of the AromaDeluxe models. We were very disappointed with the quality of the coffee it made."
3,Seems excellent... but cheaply made.,"I bought this coffee maker for my dad for Christmas. It made excellent tasting coffee, and was very easy and simple to use - especially for someone who has a hard time figuring out new gadgets & electronics.Unfortunately, after only 5 months, the automatic shut-off broke. And that was the reason I bought it for my dad in the first place... because he always forgets to turn the coffee maker off."
4,Good coffee maker,"This is a good little coffee maker. I stress the word ""little"" because while it is a ""10 cup"" coffee maker, it's those infamous 4oz cups that manufacturers seem to think people use. Which means that it actually brews about 4 decent sized mugs.We've gone through our share of coffee makers, and my maxim has become ""the cheaper the better"". It doesn't take too many $100 coffee makers in the trash to make you rethink your purchasing, and this little guy is actually high-end for us.It's simple to use - there's only one button on it, and it makes a great cup of coffee. No drips from the spout, either.There's been a trend lately for manufacturers to include elaborate water filters, but I think this is a scam to force people to keep buying them. This unit also has an inline filter and a little dial to remind me to buy a new one each month, but guess what? I took the filter out, and the coffee still tastes fine."
4,Great Coffee Maker,"This is the second Braun coffee maker we have owned and wouldn't think of owning any other. This model is the successor to our previous model which lasted about 7 years or so. It makes great tasting coffee quickly. It uses the cone shaped #4 filter, and uses a water filter which lasts about 2 months, which in my opinion is not really needed. It doesn't leak when you remove the canister to pour coffee."
1,QC getting worse at Braun,"My last one (same model) was good. This one, the auto shut-off just buzzes and doesn't shut off."
3,Not a Vacuum,"This product is a small, lightweight, moterized broom. As far as I can tell, there is no suction at all. Everything must be pushed into the very small receptacle by the rotating brush.Therefore, it does very poorly with anything that is not dust. I tried to pick up popcorn, and it had trouble with it.The main value is the light weight and convenience of cordless. I can imagine a much superior product, however.Two of my stars go to this convenience...it does pick up the bulk of dust-like material for a minor spill with minimal hassle since it is cordless. The base station is well designed for charging.However, almost any hand-held real vacuum has real suction that far exceeds the relatively feeble pick up of this small unit. It is only good for marginal pickup until you have time to get the real vacuum out."
1,Better getting a broom.,"I was very disappointed with this product. Sanyo Dirt Hunter had so much problem picking up small, light pieces of paper off a hard wooden floor. Do not expect to get much cleaning out of this vacuum. You'll be much better off getting a mop."
1,Flimsy plastic,Ordered the drill guide and before it got here I stopped at Sears and checkedx out there guide. Went ahead and bought it for less then the H3487. Good thing because when the H3487 arrived it was no where near the tool as the Sears one. Its plastic with flimsy parts and no springs on the rods very disappointed with it. Buy the Sears for less and get more.
2,General Tool H3487 Precision Drill Guide,I have used one of these precision drill guides two times to drill holes to put lock sets into doors. The cross slide that contains the drill chuck and shaft cracked through the chuck stop hole on the one side. The cross slide is too weak to even support the lightest duty service. The cross slide needs to be redesigned with flanges and beads at a minimum in order to handle normal loads encountered during use. Material changes to the cross slide my be needed. The design of the cross slide is a total failed effort.
5,a MUST HAVE in your spice cabinet!,"guacamole, empanada dough, meat rubs or sauces! a little goes a long way and adds a beautiful aroma and kick to your food."
1,Don't bother,"The Sharkport won't work with any PS2 models made after March 2003; the last model # it will work with is 390001 or something like that.To top it off, InterAct, the company that originally made it, went out of business and MadCatz took over but apparently don't support it. You can't find anything for it on their website.Get an AR Max instead."
3,Sharkport for PS2,"Works great now, but had a tough time getting to run on my PC. The software CD that comes with Sharkport2 is obsolete, so you have to download a 5 MB file from Interact. (Don't try that on a 28.8 modem)! After installing that file, Sharkport STILL wouldn't load. Two calls into customer support - still nothing. After researching their website myself, I found the missing file (.dll), downloaded it into my System folder, and viola! Sharkport booted, working well. You can then download saved games with trillions of dollars, unlocked vehicles, team rosters, etc. Overall, a 3 out of 5."
1,"Major problems already, and I haven't even gotten it to work","First of all, the included PC software CD doesn't work for Windows XP, so you must download an update from their website. Second, the PS2 software CD doesn't work for newer model PS2's (I have 3001 R and it won't even load up). You have to contact them to order an update. So out of the box, all of the software is worthless.Apparently, you can only have one save database, it must be named PCDatabase.spc, and must be located in the program folder. Additional saves must be in separate files. Interact acknowledges that the Sharkport does not work for all games, such as GTA3.I bet I'd have more problems to tell about if I actually got this damn thing to work."
1,No longer supported,"I bought this Item,and you can no longer get support for it. MadCatz bought out interact and no longer supports any of the interact products. So therefore now I have a sharkport that is totally useless to me."
4,YOU NEED A PS2 MEM CARD TO USE!!!!!!,I really like the shark port. really great and all except that i thought u wouldnt need a memory card! i went all the way to the nearest game store in the rain and bought it. on the box it says ::use yer comp as a massive memory card:: so i bought it.so i go home and play a long game of GTA3 and try to save. and then i read the manual inside and then it says u need a mem card. Damn marketing tricks....
2,A Head's Up For Users,"<rant>I can't review this item fairly because I have yet to make it work.It seems that Sony released a different ""version"" of the PS2 in recent months, and while I was aware of that, it never occurred to me that Interact wouldn't ship both versions of their PS2 CD in the box. Unfortunately, they don't. You get one CD, and it's anyone's guess whether or not it will work. If the Sharkport PS2 CD you get loads right out of the box for you, consider yourself lucky. Otherwise, you'll wait for up to 2 weeks to get the compatible one from Interact.They _could_ ship both versions in the initial package, but they don't. They _could_ allow you to order the other version online, but they don't.Like I said... this could be a fine product. It might work like a dream. Just don't count on being able to use it as soon as you get it. Otherwise, you'll wind up bitter and depressed... like me.</rant>"
4,SIRIUS is a better value,"SIRIUS is the other satellite radio offering, which is...more ...per month. Why did I chose SIRIUS? It has much more commerical free programming and they also have an exclusive with National Public Radio - XM cannot offer NPR. If I have to pay for radio, then I want less commericials. This technology is outstanding but there are two choices - I prefer SIRIUS."
2,crazy indeed,"join a scary looking red-eyed beaver on his journeys across the great white north. although the rhymes are forced, and the plasticine illustrations are rather bland, this is an easy read for young readers who are interested in the geography of canada. the highlights of this book are the charming national facts in the corner of each page."
4,Terrific Exercise Video,I grew up as a youngster exercising and dancing to this video. It is not hard to follow as you have low to high impact available. It also has some cool dance moves which are just great for older people who may wanna exercise and dance at the same time. You can learn some of the hip dance moves here. Jane does a good job at 52 years old at looking nice and dancing. I commend her for that. Buy this tape as well if you're into hip-hop dancing and/or choreography!!
5,Really great!,"I have been using this tape since 1992, and I have found it to be very effective. I have used several other exercise videos during this period, and this is the only one that has kept my interest, and really kept me fit over all these years. You really break a sweat. At the end of the class you feel like going on some more! I recommend it to persons at all fitness levels. I like the fact that you can do a 20, 40 or 60 min class. I give it two thumbs up!"
5,A fun workout video which is good for anyone at all levels.,The Lean Routine is a super workout video. I especially like the way it can be adapted to all levels of fitness--or unfitness! The nutritional advice at the end is helpful as well. I'm sorry it's out of print; I just hope my copy won't wear out as I use it several times a week!
4,Where's the DVD ????,"I love the Jane Fonda workouts. She really knows how to motivate you. Yes, it takes a bit to learn the moves, but trust me you will really enjoy it.The problem is that I no longer have a VHS player. My old one started eating tapes and I never replaced it because DVD's are so much more popular now. I would love to have this workout on DVD. I know they could sell tons of them.The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is not available in a DVD format."
5,overall workout,"i have been doing this tape since 1990, i know it by heart. i look forward to working out to this tape. i do it 5 days a week. it definitely keeps my weight down, and has hepled my lose weight in the past, with sensible eating."
5,Great,"This is one of my favorite workout videos and I have been using it for years. I just wish they would put it on DVD with chapters so that I could move to the cool down and stretch after 20 minutes or 30 minutes or whenever I want.If you do not like dance, this is not the workout for you. I love to dance and have no problems following the steps. I do the 20 minutes when I do not have very much time, or continue on for another 20 minutes when I have time, then fast forward to cool down. The whole 60 minutes is very challenging for me and I have to work my way up to it, slowly.Jane's cueing is superb and she and her staff know how to make the workout fun. She also devotes a lot of time to the cool down and stretch which many fitness experts shortchange.I actually get a kick out of the old 1980's look. The look is so ridiculous and funny, but then, so is any old fashion trend. Remember bell bottoms and nehru jackets :)))"
4,"Great, easy workout",Can anyone tell me how to find Jane Fonda's Beginners Workout from the 80's? If so please e-mail me at Educ8tr1@aol.com
3,Not for beginners...,"This is a fun workout, but not for beginners! The moves are fast and tricky, and not always intuitive. This is a really fun dance tape, edgy, creative. But not easy for those of us whose coordination is somewhat ""challenged""... ! The low-impact version of the routines is also not very visible. This would be a great tape for intermediate or advanced aerobicizers who are looking for a fun dance workout."
2,not a workout!!!,"I didnt have high expextations when I ordered this tape - I know from ecperience that 20-40-60 minute classes on the same tape might mean you have to run the tape in the middle of the exsersize or too match cool down/worm up or not enough. But having many of Janes workouts that work for me so well I desided to go for it, because I need more tapes for the time I am in harry fro work and I only have 20 or 40 minutes.I was so dissappointed! this is not a workout at all - just a seies of dances (very good I admit and fun to do) - no worm up, no cool down, there is a note of the 20 minutes end but no streches or anything, there is no note that 40 minutes ended - finally after 47 minutes I had to go so I did my own quick cool down and stopped the tape ..Buy this tape ony if you need aerobic part for another workout and you dont mind switching the tapes all the time."
2,Not brilliant!,"I wasn't impressed with this one! I found it to be somewhat cheesy and dated! Jane Fonda is wearing an awful bodice which looks quite uncomfortable. This video includes a warm up, aerobics, and a cool down. The problem with this video is the choreography is complicated to follow. Not one of the best Jane Fonda videos, I wouldn't recommend it!"
4,Value For Money,"Feel nice in the hand and pretty sturdy, not the best I have ever used so I am giving them a 4. Would I purchase these again for the price that they are Yes."
5,Braun KF580,"This was a gift for my mother for Christmas, and she loves it alot, it saves alot of space which is great for her. And so easy to use, she loves it! She was not expecting me to get her a Braun, but she really does think alot of it!"
4,coffemaker,Excellent product. Had one before. I paid way too much for it. My fault. I didn't check other coffemakers listed from same manufacturer.
2,Braun,"I had a Braun coffee maker before. It was one of the best coffee makers I ever had.There are draw backs to this coffee maker:1. It is Highly over priced.2. They don't make a twelve cup coffee maker.3. This one seems flimsy,not as durable as my old one.4. It doesn't seem to brew very hot.5. You can't see the water level on the side very well.6. Couldn't find it in black. Coffee stains the white after awhile."
2,"Lousy, inconsistent coffee","We've been using Brauns for years -- they make a decent cup of coffee even if I can never seem to pour from the carafe without spilling. But this most recent one...bad, bad, bad. Some key flaws:1. On our previous machine, we used 5-6 coffee scoops to make a strong 8 cup pot. This one requires at least 8. That's 33% more coffee.2. Even with the additional coffee, the taste is inconsistent. One day it is strong enough...the next day it tastes like a brown crayon dipped in warm water.3. The coffee never seems to get hot enough. We don't even keep the carafe on the burner, preferring to pour it right into a thermos.4. A good 20% of the time, something weird happens -- the water may spray out of the grounds; the water may start to leak; etc. etc.The unit is now on its way to trash-heap retirement. And I can say that its replacement will not be a Braun. Too bad."
1,Braun coffeemaker experience,"I bought the Braun 10 cup white coffeemaker about one year ago. My coffeepot appears to have the same features as this one except for the TimeControl. I can not find out if my model is still available. Initially I read positive reviews and was quite pleased with it. I had owned a Braun coffee pot previously for 18 years with no problems until the heating element went out. This new coffeemaker, however, has developed a series of problems so severe that I am going to throw it out. Initially the coffee started tasting bitter, especially if not poured as soon as it was made. Then the ""pause and pour"" feature quit, and I noticed the coffeepot started dripping whenever I poured from it. The most recent change is that the filter basket swings out while the coffee is brewing, every time!! I won't buy Braun again."
4,Braun KF580,Purchased the Braun KF580 coffee maker and I am thoroughly please with it. I especially like the shut off timer.
4,Braun KF580,"The machine is a good looking design and has all the functions for normal use conveniently. Though I prefer my coffee very hot, the KF580 does not make coffee hot enough for me."
5,My favorite one so far,"I've tried and returned a bunch of coffee makers over the years. I love this machine. Our old basic Braun met its demise after several years of faithful service. My wife found this on sale. I wasn't thrilled with the idea of white. I've had other white coffee makers before, and the carafe lid stains within days. Not so with this one. It still looks great after a few months. It makes very good coffee. The brew time is much faster than the Mr. Coffee we tried for one day. The coffee comes out hotter than the previous machine. Auto timer is nice. Easy to fill tank. Number of cups marks on the side match the pot perfectly. The mesh filter basket works well. Sometimes it drips just a bit when I first remove the carafe after brewing. This apparently upsets me far less than some other reviewers. I'd buy another one in a minute."
2,disappointed with Braun....,"I had purchase a lot of Braun small appliances but this would be the first time it failed me. Month after the warranty expired, it died on me. Have the cheaper braun and it's till brewing after 5 years. I guess I'll try another brand...Shame on your Braun!"
3,Sleek Design with Poor Filter,"I had this coffee machine for a week now. I bought it on impulse during a clearance sales. The price was dirt cheap that I can;t resist it. But than I found out why it was in clearance sales. First the goods - the coffee maker had a very sleek modern design. It looked pretty on the kitchen counter. It had programmable timer, which you can wake up to a fresh pot of coffee every morning. Now the bad...the gold coffee filter didn't seem to work very well. There were tremendous amount of grind coffee powder deposited in the botton of the pot. The filter didn't ""filter"" at all. It just let the coffee pass through. Yuck. Maybe I should try paper filer."
1,Good Coffee Bad Carafe,"If your the type of person that does not mind pouring your coffee all over your counter when the carafe is full,this is the coffee maker for you. When the pot is half full or half empty (depending how you look at things)you have half a chance of geting all the coffee in the cup.It's not that Braum does not know how to design a carafe that can get the coffee in the cup they have done an excellant job with the K F 187 which we had for several years.I have just ordered the KF 800 which uses the same style carafe as the old KF 187 which made a great cup of coffee and got the coffee into the cup with no problem."
2,when unplugged it does not come back on,"I had this machine for about 3 weeks. A week ago I unplugged it to move it and when I plugged it back in it would not come on. Finally the next day I plugged it in again and it came on. This has happened two more times since. I called customer service, expecting them to ship me a new one, but they wanted me to take it to an authorized dealer to verifiy the issue. The machine works great when it is working. The coffee is hot!."
1,There's a reason why the warranty is limited to 1 year,"I'm writing this review because I came to the Amazon site to check on the replacement cost of this coffee maker. After 1.5 years of daily use, it seems to have died (no power - the screen is blank). Because I invested in a 3 pack of Brita filters (they are expensive!) I thought that I might go ahead and just replace this coffee maker. After all, it's a fairly low-priced option for what you get: the coffee does taste good and the programming feature is handy. However, as others have mentioned, it tends to drip behind the carafe, which can be messy. The mid-brew pour never worked on mine. Though I have the now useless Brita filters, I will most likely try a different brand and model because I'm not interested in annually replacing my coffee maker."
2,"Looks cool, bad coffee","Life is just too short to get frustrated by bad coffee every morning. A decent cup (or three) of *strong* coffee is all I require - is this too much to ask? Apparently so for this machine. It looks cool and the carafe feels heavy and high quality, but the coffee is really weak and awful. I have been putting in 2-3 extra scoops of grounds and I still don't like the coffee. Now, I feel like I'm just throwing good money after bad by wasting all that extra coffee grounds. Plus, the warming plate keeps the coffee way too hot and it tastes burned within 15 minutes or so. I figured out why the coffee is so weak - the hot water only sprays out of one little hole onto the grounds - my previous Krups had about 6 little holes to ""shower"" the coffee grounds. I wish I could return this Braun - I will give it away and buy either another Krups or a Cuisinart."
5,The Long Ships,"Great book. Historically accurate, funny and adventurous. I read it the first time at least 20 years ago"
4,excellent,"This book was recommended to me in a book store while visiting London. Although the cover gets 2 stars in the paperback english version, the contents, story, and history was excellent. It gives great accounts as to the culture of the times!!I would love any recommendations for something similiar"
5,"Long Ships: A ""Must Read"" for armchair adventure seekers","A fascinating book, it drags a little towards the end but it's well worth the time and money. The author's dry wit is evident throughout and his characters sprang to life in my imagination. The translator did a superb job. If you like reading about ""Vikings"" and want an adventure filled book then buy this one!"
5,Stunning,"One of the most exciting surprises I have run across in a long time. Bengtsson has managed to take the literary style and tone of the great sagas, and modernize it without losing any of the original, laconic humor. A very happy surprise and at the same time, some dismay that this book is not better recognized for the adventurous gem it is."
5,An absolute delight of a historical adventure novel.,"A well written, thoroughly engrossing historical adventure novel (actually, two novels when originally published in the author's native language). I have read this book many times and would like to do it again. My paperback copy is in tatters. I did see a paperback copies, in English, at the Viking Museum in Oslo three years ago, but, like an idiot, I didn't buy it, thinking I could get a hard bound copy."
5,Red Orm Lives!,"I first read this book many years ago. It was good then, it's still good. Timeless. Viking Age fiction is a favorite of mine, and this is one of the best I've read. The movie that was made from it starred Richard Widmark, Russ Tamblyn, and Sidney Poitier, if memory serves, and I think it does, although the spelling of some of those actors' names might be slightly off. The movie was entertaining, but as is so often true of movies made from sprawling novels like THE LONG SHIPS, the book is better!"
5,Interesting historical story,This book is a story of stories. By that I mean different individual's stories are told as the book progresses through the main characters. I found the book very interesting.
5,Wish There Were More Books Like This,"I read this book last summer and have yet to find an historical novel which can measure up to it. It truly has universal appeal; there is something for everybody in the novel. There are many instances where the reader will laugh out loud, and there are also scenes which will cause the reader to cry. As long as you like good writing (and translating, by the way) and good plotting, you will like this book. It's easy to see why this book has been translated into several langauges and gone through numerous reprints. I only wish there were more books like this around."
5,Awesome! A classic of viking literature!!!!!,This is a great book. I reccomend that you read it if you have any interest in vikings. Orm and Toste are unforgetable characters.
5,something I didn't expect,"This book is written like a Norse legend told. Sure the main characters are he men (and ladies) who are larger than life, that is the fun. On a more serious note, it does provide some insight into where and how these Norse men went ""a viking""."
3,Learned a lot of history!,"Loved the characters, and learning more about a time in history I had heard about but knew little of. A good book!"
5,One of my all-time favorites. Why can't they republish?,"As with several other of the reviewers, I first read this book long ago, and probably five times since. It is not only the adventure, the scholarship and the huge geographic extent, but above all the dry humour which appears on every page and has me chuckling although I practically know it by heart.And they say the Swedes have no sense of humour. Maybe Bengtsson was from Skania and therefore really a Dane, like his creation. The translation is a work of almost equal genius; the English reader thinks he is reading an original stylist, not a translation. But alas, I couldn't steal my father's copy, and have lost two of my own (well, something happened to them). WHEN WILL SOMEONE REPUBLISH? It has a guaranteed sale . . . ."
3,"Good first half, then bogged down","The first half of the moving moved along smartly, but then the story bogged down and after slogging slowly through about 30-50 more pages I threw in the towel."
2,"Awkward prose, flat story, poor translation","Although the story started and finished brightly it was a laborious read. I'm a big fan of historical fiction and this appeared promising. However, about a third of the way into the book I found the plot grew cold, the characters grew flat, and my overall enjoyment plummeted.The writing style was awkward and clumsy; I trust the story reads better in its native language than English. This story is intended to be a fun read but it needs a lot of editing and refactoring.If the middle 50% could be edited out of this book, I could, despite the translation, give this a 3 stars. As it is, I find the two stars overly generous."
2,Interesting but eventually tedious,"Has fun aspects, with believable historic detail. However, the endless 'blood & swash' (to pull a quote from an old favorite move, ""The Ghost & Mrs. Muir"") gets a little tedious."
5,great value,"i have two other batteries and they all drain in not more than a day, this one goes on for 2 or more depending on usage"
4,a much needed companion to the maturin/aubrey books,"anyone reading the maturin/aubrey books knows, damn that's a different language altogether! there are a lot of words and phrases that are simply no longer in our vocabulary, not even counting the esoteric naval jargon.i love the style of the books, like diving into another world altogether. but i understand maybe 2/3s of it. no matter, even so, i'm hooked. however, it is great to find that many companion books exist. the lexicon is one of the best ones, especially for those who love language. it's easy to read, insightful and practical."
