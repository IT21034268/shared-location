1,Died with HO2 errors after 5 months of infrequent use,"While I enjoyed decent picture quality and sound with this DVD player, it suddenly decided to die after 5 months. I already had had bad luck with it making lots of weird disturbing whirring sounds when playing certain DVDs (all bought from good retailers) and sometimes malfunctioning, pixelating with lots of artifacts. It would sometimes stall and I would have to reset the player by turning it off and unplugging it. Finally, after 5 months of infrequent use and perfect care, it refused to play any sort of disc whatsoever and gave me HO2 errors. It would also turn off by itself.Suffice it to say that I am **very unhappy** with this unit and won't be buying another Panasonic DVD Player again."
4,New Buyer - Review & Query,"I just bought this machine and so far have been very happy with its performance. The many features makes it a great buy for the price. My one complaint is regarding the size of the wording and display when using the features. I understand the desire for not having these feature displays block the movie you're viewing, but the print is so bloody small!! Is it just me? Ok, I admit I maybe aging and maybe my vision isn't what it once was, but I found it kindof annoying. Other than that, I am very happy with this purchase. The picture clarity is great and the machine is wonderfully quiet. I definitely feel like I got a good bang for the bucks."
2,H02 Error,"Do not buy a Panasonic DVD Player. Lasted 14 months, and then I got the dreaded H02 error."
1,Do never buy panasonic DVD player.,"Like most other people, my panasonic DVD player died on HO2 error too. I have used it only two years and I could never expect such short life span. After I searched about HO2 error on the google, I found that it is the most common error occuring in panasonic dvd players within two years. Further more, fixing cost is more than new one.($89.99 for labor cost + shiping and handling) When you buy DVD players, do never buy DVD players with Panasonic logo."
1,Poor Picture nice features,"I have a 32"" letterbox Toshiba TV (NOT high definition). I put in a DVD and then used the zoom to fill the tv screen. The picture quality degraded very badly. Be clear, it was not a minor amount. The faces became blurred and the colors turned to mush. I tried everything in the manual to correct the problem. I tried the same test on my old Philips DVD player and the picture only degraded a minor amount. I am not recommending Philips because it has a hard time with episode DVD's, remote is bad news, and loading is forever.I am not a picky detailed person. If something works okay that is good enough. I do not expect perfection.The remote on the Panasonic was okay and the DVD tray opened quickly. See, I found something good to say about the Panasonic."
1,Pnasonic DVD prone to HO2 failure,"Got it less than a year back.Did not use much, but it failed while watching amovie.The error was HO2.Do not buy this model."
1,Ditto after 8 months of heavy use (H02 error),Thanks for all of the reviews on this discontinued product. It made giving up on trying to figure out the problem go much faster. We've had ours since July and watch 5 movies a week. Now I realize that some of the problems we've had with DVDs over the last few months were the player - not the DVDs.
1,Ran well for 5 Months --- DOA ( H02 error ),This unit ran well from Oct 2003 - April 2004 Died during Dora the Explorer... Unhappy little boy...Bought a Toshiba ... Is this typical of Panasonic Electronics ? Heck the batteries in the remote lasted longer than the player.
3,Bad sound quality,I bought this DVD player based on the reviews I saw in amazon.com. This what I have found - The picture quality seems to be good (in HDTV) but I was really disappointed with the sound quality. It produces very noisy sound quality and it was not at all crystal clear. I was hearing some additional disturbing sound which I never even heard in that movie. When I played the same DVD with the other DVD player (different Panasonic model) it was so good. So I returned and looking for a good one with the Progressive scan technology.
4,little one with lot,This is a very good DVD player with all features for low budget guys... you can buy this DVD without giving second thought. it's progressive scan feature is handy. The Technical features are very good.
3,Died last night after 15 months,"Had this DVD player for about 15 months. Last night, I put in a DVD, and the menu came up for the movie. All of a sudden the machine shut off on it's own. I turned it back on, and as it tried to read the DVD, it shut off again. I did this several times, and even switched DVD movies. Every time, the machine shut itself off. When I took the DVD out of the tray, and left it empty, the machine would stay on and say ""nodisc"" of course. Put in another movie, off it went. I've trieed to unplug it for 30 minutes, blew in it, tried a cleaner disc...NOTHING.Panasonic tells me I have to turn it in to an authorized dealer, but I told them forget it. I've already checked and it will cost more than a new one.I was wondering if anyone ran into this problem?[...]. Thanks.As for Panasonic, I think I'll buy a Sony tomorrow."
1,I too agree!!!!,"This worked great for one year!. Now it shows ""no Disc"" orH02(what is that mean?!!). I have to double think beforebuying a panasonic again."
1,It died on me in less than a year,"I bought the DVD player in late September last year. I watch about 2 to 3 DVDs per week and had no problems with the player until last night when it suddenly wouldn't play any DVDs. I put in several and everytime I did it would just shut off. It would stay on as long as I didn't place a DVD in it. I called Panasonic and from the tone of customer service rep I could tell she had received similar complaints. She also told me that she had also received complaints in which consumers received an error message similar to the one described by previous reviewers. She said it sounded like something had shorted out and recommended a repair service. Frankly, I'm not surprised that this product has been discontinued."
1,Worked for a while,Small comfort that I'm not the only one having trouble with this player. It has been steadily degrading since six months after I bought it to the point where I no longer can play DVDs without the player ruining the experience. Called Panasonic and got no help except being offered to buy a refurbished replacement for $90 + shipping. No thanks! I will never buy a Panasonic DVD player again.Stay away!
3,One Aggravating Problem!,"Overall, this is a good unit, but if you're a movie snob like me, you may be annoyed by the brief pause that will happen during a layer change on any dual layer DVD (and almost ALL DVDs are dual layer these days). I find the pause distracting - I thought the whole point of DVD was to see a ""perfect"" version of a movie. Most other players do not have this problem, but a customer service rep at Panasonic told me that ALL Panasonic DVD players have this pause during layer changes. My 5 year old RCA player didn't even have this problem, and most DVD tech sites will tell you that any decent player shouldn't have this problem either.I'll still give it three stars because it's a GREAT Mp3/WMA player and it does a good job with VCDs, SVCDS, and DVDRs. Ironically, the only place that this DVD player fails is in playing DVDs!"
1,Fine for a while....then HO2 error...,Just like the other reviews you are reading. Works great for a about 6-8 months then any dvd you put in...DEAD.
3,Plays VCD's for a while then freezes and locks up,"I love Panasonic products and bought this S35S DVD Player because I needed a player to play ALL formats including VCD, WMA, MP3, CD-R, etc. Unfortunately, when playing one of my commercially produced VCD's it would play for awhile, and then lock and freeze the screen forever, until I turned off the power. And it kept on doing it, repeatedly. Sadly I returned the Panasonic for a full refund. (The VCD was not defective, because it plays fine on my older JVC player, and on my computer.)I then purchased the JVC XV-N50BK DVD Player which plays all formats, including my above mentioned VCD, without any problems. I am very happy with the JVC XV-N50BK, and this is the best in the market. Incidently all my other AV components and TV are JVC, and which can all be linked and interconnected with the JVC Compu-Link control system."
3,JPEG did not work on this unit,"After reading the reviews, I had expectations that there would be problems with this unit. It seems to be constructed well. It played all of my DVD's without a problem. However, it had difficulty reading my jpg disks. Some would scan while others would abort halfway through the picture. I wondered if something was wrong with my disk. I had received one of the very cheap Norcent players as a present. I popped the same disk in it and it played with no problem at all. As far as I could tell, the Norcent player is more cheaply made, but it plays everything I throw at it. Not the same with this player. Maybe my unit was defective. I sent it back and asked for my money back. One more thing. The unit is quite wide as well."
2,nice player let down by build quality and poor support,"i bought this unit in april and have really enjoyed it...until now. here it is, only august and already it is broken. it now emits a loud growling sound during the menu and first five minutes of every dvd. obviously it is having some difficulty spinning at that speed. the warranty for parts is one year, but after 90 days, the warranty for labor is already up. i had my previous player, a pioneer for 4 years with no problems. you get what you pay for i guess."
1,Died after 9 months,"It was a great dvd player at a great price . . . while it lasted.After 9 months it stopped accepting all of my dvd's (store bought movies and burned dvd-r's): I put one in, it tries to read it, and then it just shuts down.A lot of people all over the Internet are reporting problems with this model, as well as other Panasonic models. Would I buy another Panasonic? No way.If you still think you want a Panasonic, do a lot of research before spending your money. Don't get caught with a seriously flawed player and a crappy warranty (1 yr. parts, 90 days labor--and the labor costs about the price of the machine)."
1,Beware Short Lifespan,"I unfortunately have to concur with the previous Panasonic S35 DVD owner. After about a year of moderate use, tonight it just stopped playing DVDs, and would shut off everytime I tried to load a DVD in it. The player had some great features, but apparently Panasonic uses inferior parts in its home electronics. I've read similar reports regarding other Panasonic DVD player models."
1,Panasonic POS,I purchased it back in Oct 2003 with minimal usage. I unplugged the unit today and went to plug it back in and it will not turn on. Based on other reviews I am not the only person to have this problem. This DVD player is a true POS. They gave me the option to get it repaired since it is beyond 90 days.This is not worth a repair....Save your money... Panasonic sucks.... They charge a $90 flat fee but they cover the parts... Why would anyone pay $90 to repair a $90 DVD player... Throw it in the garbage and cut your losses. Their customer support is useless also
3,Not for big screen TV,"You can read all the glowing reviews on what is good about this DVD player. It is in fact a fine, inexpensive DVD player with lots of features.But it was inadequate for my new 51"" wide-screen HDTV monitor. Noticed the problem with the Road to Perdition DVD, and then also on Pulp Fiction. As if the DVD player did not have enough color depth (like a computer running on 16-bit color instead of 32-bit).Did some research, found the ""DVD Shootouts"" on the Web and figured I needed the Panasonic XP-30. Very-very difficult to find as it is discontinued, but it was worth the effort. It is just a little better than the S35, but that little bit is a MUST for a serious TV.In short, the S35 is fine for a non-HDTV or smaller TV-set, but not good enough for serious movie watching."
5,PICTURE BLOWS ME AWAY,"Have only had it a week, but have used it on DVD movies. CD's CD/R. Amazes how good the quaility of sound it reproduces playing MP3's. Picture quality is excellent. Much better than the VCR. Hook-up was easy. I do play it through a Sony reciever for the sound and into a Sanyo TV using the monitor out at the reciever, and video in at TV. Haven't tried the S-video hook up yet but will when I pick up cable. The manual could be easier to read. But you figure it out with just a little use. Reviews for this player at other video tech sites was excellent. They didn't lie."
4,"Great, thin, inexpensive","I really like this DVD player. It's thin enough to fit nearly anywhere (which is a good thing, given the way empty space is at a premium in some people's homes), but feature-packed. But the most beautiful thing about it is it cost me less than a bill. In today's financial climate, quality and value are important.I haven't come across any bugs yet; every DVD has played crisply. One feature I like, but didn't think I would, is the zoom, which increases the size of the picture without a loss of clarity, which is a boon on a tiny set. Yes, you lose a little of the peripheral picture, but, for the most part, it's not enough to damage the viewing experience.I like it."
1,What are people talking about? This copy SUCKS.,"Okay, so I got this based on a lot of positive reviews for a DIFFERENT VERSION. this one is ""edited"" and has so many mistakes it's not even funny. example: ""A17ILD nights! Wild nights!""The ""table of contents"" is a list ""section 1, section 2"" and so on. how is this supposed to help me? Try including the first line or at least the number of the poem. THIS IS A FAIL like i have never seen in the publishing world before. a child could bind a better book."
1,Buy another version!,"So, I think I'm turning into a chick. I got on an email list of Great Poems. Saw a few by Ms. Emily and figured, ""Wow... great stuff! I'll go to Amazon and get a book of her poetry."" It's cool, guys can do it online so no one knows you're reading chick lit, and might be turning into a chick.When I got this in it says up front in the copyright stuff ""Yeah, we just OCRd some book off a shelf someplace, didn't take any time to fix the typos. Sorry for your luck"" Well maybe not those exact words, but that's what they meant. They weren't lying. It's crap, filled with typos, and no clear differentiation between one poem and the next. You're better off to read them online or something. Now I just have to throw it away. It's not worth the $6 to take it to the post office!"
1,DON'T BUY THE KINDLE VERSION: DIFFERENT BOOK!,"Amazon is doing a bait-and-switch on the Kindle edition of this. You don't get the Franklin Reading Edition--instead you get a cheaply made version of a 1955 Edition of Dickinson. DON'T BUY THIS! If you do, demand your money back and demand that Amazon remove this link. It's shoddy practice and should be criminal, if it isn't."
1,misrepresented,"In this edition of Dickinson poems the typing is automated. They used Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software to scan the original book. This means there are typos everywhere along with random words or characters that do not belong in the poem. This edition is not good for close reading and analysis. I did not know this until after I bought it. When I looked through the pages online they were fine. Nowhere was the OCR mentioned. I found a short explantion on the publishers page once it arrived. Since I am a teacher, I obviously cannot use this book with my students. I will have to find another edition I guess. Beware."
3,One BIG Problem,"Sound, graphics, and animation are perfect. The bonus screens are great on the nickel slots. Problem: the machines are too loose!!! Like another reviewer said, the game is way too easy and that makes playing somewhat dull. A Vegas Casino would go broke in about a week with payoffs like this. Still, worth playing with a morning cup of coffee or when you need to take a 10 minute break from something else during the day."
2,bottom of barrell,I have three of the Phantom slot games..I was very dissapointed in the Reel Deal 2nd Vol. Love Reel Deal Nickels & More and Nickel Alley. They are great games...Lots of fun the Reel Deal 2nd Vol did not have graphics and not nearly as many good bonus games... I buy all the new slot game as they come out..Masque also has some really fun slot game...
1,Do not Purchase,Ordered 2 from this manufacturer - both had defective CD's - my computer is under complete warranty so even had Dell Tech try to install them. Had to return both games. Called manufacturer for tech. support - right - he told me it had a bad computer. So much for that - will certainly never purchase again.
2,hagar101,"This game is too easy. you always win. for some reason it also resets my screen to 800x600. I've got XP home, maybe it's different for other systems. I regret spending the money for this. If you buy it I hope you have better luck! hagar101"
2,Diffulties in loading,This is NOT the seller's fault. No false promises were made. But I had difficulty loading this onto my computer....both computers....at home. Eventually I could play a game but it was hard to find instructions as to how to get to other games. I wouldn't have bought this if I knew it was going to be so difficult to use.
3,Reel Deal Slots 2,I bought this for my 68 year old mother who likes to play slots.She's not very computer savey but was able to navigate around this game and we both thought it was fun.
2,outdated,"will not load on my windows vista, after reading label it says supports up to windows xp, should have stated on web site, but probably why it cost so little."
4,Reel Deal Slots Vol. 2,Lots of fun. Hours of great slot entertainment. Delivery through Amazon.com was fast and easy to order. I will be ordering more fun slot games from Phantom EFX through Amazon. Enjoy the game it's SLOTS OF FUN.
3,Not as good as I expected...,"I bought this album having already bought ""Grind Bastard"" and ""Transcend the Rubicon"". I really haven't listened to this album all that much since I got it about 4 months ago. It just doesn't do too much for me. I already knew the song ""Senile Dementia,"" which is a great tune. It's fast and pretty catchy. The rest of this album is a bit slower and doesn't hold my interest. To be fair, it might still grow on me after repeated listens. I just wanted to write this review for people who may be new to Benediction: start with ""Transcend the Rubicon,"" a great death metal release. If you like that check out ""Grind Bastard,"" it's more straightforward death/thrash with catchy songwriting and great drumming. If you love Benediction then check this out but I would get the other two first."
1,Disappointing,"I found the book unconvincing. The ""case studies"" - if that is what they were - were mushy and read like an ego trip for the author. She seemed really please at how ""advanced"" the communicators thought she was and the hierarchies of entities - low entities and higher entities etc sound like the usual New Age tripe that fills similar books across the internet. For anyone worried that they may be overshadowed by a spirit, or worse, this book is less then useless in my opinion. I regret buying it. If you are simply interested in this field - find a copy of Carl Wicklands ""30 Years Among the Dead"" - it's a lot more convincing. If you think you need treatment for obssession I'd steer away from this book and consult a psychiatrist or a reputable medium (if you can find one)."
1,Freeing the Readers,"I awaited my order of ""Freeing the Captives"" by Dr. Ireland-Frey with great interest. It seemed to address a specific problem I was researching from a novel point of view. However, my dissapointment upon obtaining it and reading it was extreme. Even after redefining possession in this rather politically correct view of 'spirit attachment', the author fails to offer more than bone or two toward the how's and why's. Fully 85 percent of the book are recountings of seemingly effortless 'healings'. Dr. Ireland-Frey lays the probable cause of everything from mood swings to cancer to Multiple Personality Disorder to some level of 'spirit obsession'. If you are looking for a book to aid you in seeking to understand why certain things might occur, this is not your book. If, however, you want a book full of happy endings, and not a hair mussed in achieving them, indeed ""Freeing the Captives"" might be exactly what you are looking for."
1,Main Aur Mrs Khanna,"Another flop from Sohail Khan's production. Story is rather pointless and I can't quite understand Salman's character having to leave the wife behind in Australia without any proper visas( silly),yet she's not allowed to follow him to Singapore either for some unknown reason other than being an inconvenience and what followed next was rather hazy as by then I've totally switched off! Salman seemed disinterested and detached from the role of a blow-hot/blow-cold husband to Karina Kapoors' vapid acting as an abandoned wife. Sohail was irritating and his acting was wetter than Jacques Cousteau's wetsuit in a poor attempt to inject some inane comedy into the movie. Songs weren't too bad with 2 rather good ones and the only reprieve from total boredom of this story was an item number, courtesy of Priety Zinta. Give this one a wide berth unless you intent to go comatose halfway through the movie!"
2,My Review,This movie was an ok movie to watch but I think this movie could be alot more better made. But I like Jackie chan's movie so i'm not going to complain that much about this movie.
1,"when you go to hell, Satan will make you watch this movie!",ok in the beginning it was funny. even though the voice acting is crappy and animated. the movie had potential (comedy that it )and everything else went straight to hell.the street fighter part killed me. Oh God why? why!!
1,"Quite possibly, the worst Jackie Chan Film of all time.","This is quite possibly the worst Jackie Chan Film of all time. You will only find this film funny for about five minutes. After that, you will be wondering what dolt thought that this would make a good movie. It is only about 90 minutes, but it is so bad that it seems like days when the movie is finally over. I remember reading an interview with Jackie Chan where he commented that this was the worst film that he had ever made, and if you make the mistake of watching it I think you will agree. It is based off of an anime series by the same title. The anime is better, and would rate about 2 1/2 stars. The film fails to capture even the average quilty of the anime. If you enjoy watching bad movies for laughs, I would strongly recommend that you avoid this one. It is such a bad movie that not even a diehard Jackie Chan fan like myself can find any enjoyment in this awful movie."
1,Awful,"Don't believe any positive reviews of this movie. It is terrible. There is one good stunt, but nothing else worth seeing. For collectors only. That pretty much covers it."
1,"STICK WITH HK IMPORTS ""ALWAYS""","Why American production make HK movies look so cheap? First of all, they cut off so much scene, second of all ruin it by making look act so dumb by English Dubb. ALWAYS stick with ORIGINAL LICENSED HK RELEASE. Be careful with cheap imports, boots, and bulls though."
2,Not a great Jackie Chan Movie,"This movie was very disappointing. Many parts were quite funny, especially the Street Fighter scene. But the action was a bit to weak me. Too many shenanigans and dumb jokes. The supporting characters were very annoying too."
2,2 1/2 For Jackie Fans who want sumthin a bit different.,"My reason for this rating is because a casual moviegoer would not enjoy this film. Nor would any Kung Fu movie fans. There are a few scenes which are very memorable, ie- Bruce Lee Move theatre, Streetfighter, and a pretty cool end fight scene. This is one silly film, maybe even a bit stupid and weird at times. My two friends hated this movie alot, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. Jackie Chan has done better, no doubt, and this is not for first timers. Its an attempt at creating the world of Anime in a non-animation setting. I appreciate what its trying to do, and it had alot of funny gags that you would find normally in an anime. (FOr example guy characters always are hungry and girl chasing)The fight scenes are goofy, but as always jackie makes them interesting, especially the end fight. This is not for everyone, but its cool to see an Anime come to life like this.HardCore Jackie Chan fans need only apply."
1,A very disappointed Jackie Chan fan.,"This may have been one of those movies Jackie did as a favor to a friend. If so, it must have been a REALLY good friend. This has to be by far the worst Jackie Chan movie since the 1970's. It is silly, sophomoric, and moronic. Jackie does almost none of the of the great stunt work he is famous for. Instead, he just clowns around mugging for the camera like it's some sort of home movie for his friends. And it is not even his voice in the soundtrack.As a matter of fact, the only laughs I had during this movie were the poorly done English subtitles: ""Out of bullets! What a miser!""I was expecting something really good after reading these other reviews. To each his own, I suppose. My first Jackie Chan movies were the Police Story series. If you are looking for another one of those, this is not it!This movie makes me wonder why great films like ""Police Story"" are not out on DVD and most of Jackies worst films are. Save your money and avoid this one."
3,Live Action Japanimation on a sugar high:),"Ever watch a really kinetic Japanese animation? Keep that inmind while watching this movie. All the unique camera angle andjumbled array of characters make this a very enjoyable film. Taken straight from the Japanese cartoon, this film translates well as a entertaining watch."
4,Really quite good,"This movie is very weird, but nevertheless very enjoyable. There are a couple of great fights (especially the street fighter fight , the Bruce Lee one and the end fight wich is purely fantastic) and some good stunts (watch for when Jackie sumersaults of a platform about 15ft high to avoid an explosion and lands on his feet!) This may not appeal to some people but I thought this film was incredably enjoyoble."
3,"Not his best, but very enjoyable","I am no great Jackie Chan fan, but I have seen this movie several times. It is very much a live action comic book, and if you're a fan of live comic book action (like the Batman TV series, for example), then you should enjoy this movie. There is the trademark Chan slapstick and stunts, but if for nothing else, you have to see the live-action Streetfighter 2 sequence where Jackie turns into various video game characters while fighting the nefarious ""Ken""."
2,City Hunter,"This is one of Jackie Chan's worst movies.I know he was trying something different with this movie but it just didn't work.It was way over the top and it really wasn't that funny.I really didn't care for much of the characters.It had some weird scenes in it also.I guess making the comic into a movie didn't translate to well.It's still a worth a watch though for the stunts and for the die hard Jackie fans but I would just rent,not buy."
2,Too absurd even by the Chan standard,"Even a bad Jackie Chan movie turns out to be better than most of the action/comedies available, but City Hunter is an exception.The action is hard to follow, and the humor too childish. By example, while fighting at the game room, he turns into characthers of the ""Street fighter"" video game, turning even into Chun Li (with make up, dress and everything) and making some of the moves as in the videogame.It is uncomfortable to enjoy the movie when it turns so stupid. There is a good scene in which Chan, fighting inside a movie theatre, imitates the movements of Bruce Lee on the screen. But thhat scene alone is not worth the experience of ""City Hunter"""
4,Not your typical Jackie Chan movie,"First off if your expecting a typical Jackie chan movie like Rush Hour then your in for a big surprize. It's a great movie but you have to understand a few things before watching it. One thing is that this movie is a live action film based on an anime. Second you have to understand traditional anime, I don't mean like cowboy bebop or sailor moon. I mean the kind that we can only get with english subtitles. If you like cute anime then you'll like this movie. My favorite part it when jackie gets thrown into a video game machine an becomes street fighter characters. It has alot of action and the female cast gets beat up alot, but they try hard. I enjoyed it because I'm a kid at heart. I hope you enjoy it too."
3,nice kit,"This is one of AMT's older kits with very little detailin the chassis or motor, still is is a fun kit for beginners. You could buy the AMT Yankee Challenge anduse parts from it to build a super Cuda which is what Idid and the model looks awesome, either way it is a nicekit and worth the money, I would highly recommend it."
4,"Percussive, funny and fast","I enjoyed this recording many times when I was a lot younger. I never saw the show, but I admired the album very much. I've seen and heard lots of shows since this one briefly appeared on Broadway, and I agree that it is a whole lot more listenable than most of the recent Broadway musicals, failure or success. I'm not sure I would have enjoyed seeing the show, but it makes for highly entertaining listening. And no, it is not Sondheim or Lloyd Webber, but that's maybe a good thing."
2,"I used to hate it, but...","Yes, a B (or even C) show. And yet -- the lyrics are lyrics for an A show, hip, literate, funny. Not on the level of the Leigh/Coleman ""Little Me"" (an A show for sure), but how can you not love a beautiful opener like ""May I present/To this old town/A Lochinvar/With his lances down""? Brilliant. It's a very, very cynical show (and if you're looking for a satiric explanation of the mess we're in today, the book of this show is not a bad place to look). Bernstein's music has its moments -- ""Walk Away,"" is always mentioned as the show's best ballad, and it is quite haunting, but on the whole it sounds like music orchestrated for 100 kazoos, and that deserved such orchestration. Worst of all are the performances: all three leads sing very crassly, Marlyn Mason particularly limning what appears to be an extremely unpleasant character. On the whole, it's a pretty annoying listening experience -- but, oh, those lyrics! Where is Carolyn Leigh when we need her?"
3,NOT A MASTERPIECE BUT NICE TO LISTEN,"Mixed reviews for this old musical comedy that, in my opinion, is neither great nor awful as some reviewers assert. Some songs are very funny and the music - in most cases - is charming. It's not Kurt Weill or Andrew Lloyd Webber, but it has some really catchy moments and you listen to it pleasantly. I'm glad I got it."
2,NOT as pictured,"I ordered this book to add to my set of red/white Zane Grey books. It was not at all as pictured, though it was a first edition. I was disappointed that the item was not as I expected it to be."
5,NIV Prophecy Marked Reference Study Bible - Hardcover,Book was listed in good condition and when I received it was not disappointed. Received the book before the promise date. Very happy with purchase.
1,A fake bible,"I saw this heretic on God TV with those two bird-brains Wendy and Rory and this idiot claimed Solomon had a CHILD with the Queen of Sheba (this he claimed, was what the scriptures meant, when it is written: ""1 Kings 10:13: And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty."" ).As for the NIV - it a fake/false perverted textJUST ONE OF A NUMBER OF MISSING VERSES IN MAIN TEXT: Mathew 17:21 Howbeit, this kind goeth not out, but by prayer and fasting.

2,Slow + No answers to exercises,"This book is quite easy to read for a beginner. However, for a true beginner who needs to check answers to the exercises provided in the book...well, that's another story. The authors forgot who their audience is and just like that they decided not to provide answers to the exercises given at the end of the chapters. This made the book quite a bit challenging for me, and the so called ""P2P"" forums in the publisher's website are many times not useful at all. Before buying this book, browse through all of the complaints posted in these ""P2P"" forums and you'll know what I'm talking about.Otherwise, the book is presented in a fairly comprehensive way for a beginner to understand."
2,Not That Great,"I don't understand why the other reviewers are so positive about this book. It's drier than crackers in the Sahara and it spends way too much time on Windows Forms. It also assumes you're very familiar with VS.NET. A ""Beginning"" book should do a lot more hand-holding than this book does. In summary, I hated it."
3,No cd or downloadable code for exercises,"Let me quote the Wrox website: ""The exercise answers to this and several other books are not amongst the files we've been able to recover from the old Wrox servers, yet. We're still trying to find them, or to recover them from some other source so we can repost them.""It is two months later and there is still no code for the exercises at the end of the chapters. The sample code is still available, however."
5,WERQ IT WERQ IT,Very few compliation CD's make me listen all the way through. Let alone a 2 CD set. But ABLE werqs it out. The Alegria Parties are the best and somthing I miss from NYC. Keep it real and keep it coming.
1,VERY Disappointed...,"I was expecting some good tribal house music - similar to Tony Moran's Tour De Beats or like Peter Rauhofer's Liva @ Roxy 4... bought it recently coz i couldn't decide if the cd's are worth it... Well now i know they aren't! Almost no vocals in most of the tracks, tracks are so repetetive and boring... how can i say it... out of words really, u wont find any good anthems on this cd's (buy Tony Moran's Tour De Beats instead - great mixes of deborah cox and deborah cooper). I tried to find sth good on those 2 cd's - i found only 2 tracks worth listening: Nightcrawlers - Push The Feeling On (Rosabel Club Anthem) on CD1 and Origene - Sanctuary (Moran/Rigg Remix) on CD2. Rest sounds lets say not special. I really wanted to have Ofra Haza - Love Song (DJ Paulo's Mix) on WAV format but this track from the CD sounds worse then the full mix on MP3 i got... [Listened to the cd's only once - not going to waste any more time] [Tested on Creative Gigaworks S750]"
4,Pungent Stench's Dirty Rhymes,"Think punk meets an early 90s hair band and has an affair with Industrial...this band really does not have to prove themselves to make a point. The beats are poignant and direct, the guitar is melodic and driving, the samples well-placed and distinct. The vocals are VERY strong making this cd a MUST-HAVE for everyone wanting to get out of the normal run-of-the-mill and live on the edge...it's definately worth looking into!"
5,Pretty good,i'll make this short.. Sister machine gun attempts to recreate that 90's industrial feel and for the most part they succeed. although there is a couple tracks that bore me.. for the most part this is as good as it gets aside from those original songs back in the day. highly reccomended if you're an industrial fan.
3,great band-great song selection-terrible sound,"I'll make this short since I will probably get ripped on for stating this amongst a pro-crue audience but ... while I would consider myself a fan of Motley Crue I would not say I am a ""die-hard"" fan of the band, therefore I think I can offer a somewhat objective review of this set, gulp!...This is a great package with the exception of the incredibly muddy sound (way to heavy bass) and Vince Neil's labored vocals...especially on the early stuff (disc 1)... the sound cleans up a bit on disk 2 but even it is not perfect. I realize this is a live album and there are going to be flaws but those flaws should be limited to performance and not to the sound. Of course buy this set if you are a die-hard (you probably already have it) but if you are looking for a good starter disk this is not it. Try a greatest hits or their first disk."
1,Entertainment of Death? I'll Take Death,"Death surely couldn't be any worse than this album. There's a reason this two CD set is so cheap. The songs are poor, the drumming is weak (why is Tommy Lee considered such a great drummer?) and Vince Neil's vocals are just horrible. Neil definitely has one of the weakest ""heavy metal"" voices I've ever heard. Don't think I'm completely down on Crue though; I've got their ""Greatest Hits"" CD, and there's some good songs on there. But this album just doesn't cut it. Buy at your own risk."
1,Que porquería !,"Estoy cansado de los discos en vivo del tipo: Griten ! Estamos grabando ! Los típicos discos pregunta y respuesta al público. Encima parece que se hubieran olvidado los temas, se equivocan en la mayoría. No lo compren. Si les gusta Mötley compren Greatest Hits."
5,"Raw, unpolished , roaring electric guitars etc...","Raw, unpolished , roaring electric guitars etc... this album is like being at a concert! this album is like a breath of fresh air. Too many albums of all music genre's are extremely polished and manufactured. If u like thundering heavy metal and are tired of plastic in the music industry, then this very raw, roaring album is for you. This album is like finding a large diamond in the ruff. Motley also has some mp3's at there website (album section and u need an mp3 plugin ) so check it out!"
2,The best that they can do?,"Oh, how disappointing. If this is the best the Crue can do, it's little wonder they left a live album until now. The production on this is woeful. Granted some of the stuff was recorded in the early 80s when they were first starting out, but one would expect that the material recorded later would be of better quality. Vince just can't cut it live. He can't keep up with the pace of the songs and ends up just making noises that follow the tunes. The guitar is up and down and the bass is almost non-existant. This had the potential to be huge. They have had a long career and an enormous back catalogue to choose from, as evidenced by the track selection, but poor quality has let it down. There are better Hard Rock live albums out there. Only for the die hard Crue fan. One star for a live album, finally. And one for the Track listing."
4,Very enjoyable; Goes beyond the film,"For those of you who've seen the film, this story is told in the first person by Jimmy Steinway (MacKenzie Astin's character in the movie), as his character is hired by Castle Rock to tell the story of the events told in the movie. It goes beyond the film somewhat and takes us up to the characters lives today. Typical Stillman. If you like Whit Stillman's films, this book is one you can carry with you at all times. Some of the scenes from the Club don't translate very well to the book, but that's actually a plus, because the film is NOT about disco or the club per se. (Hence the bad reviews from people who mistakenly thought just because the film took place at a club, that it was a ripoff of ""54"".) Those themes are methaphorical and the book helps bring everything into perspective. I probably wouldn't want to read the book without seeing the film first. And if you see the film, you also need to see ""Metropolitan"" and ""Barcelona,"" for it to all make sense."
5,Lady P on Eddie,"A heartfelt, soulful song, hard to find. As rare a gem as Donnie Albert's music. Recommend purchasing the ""I love you"" CD/Eddie Holman."
3,"Eddie Holman - ""This Can't Be True""","This CD was released in November 2006. The release date was confirmed by his son, Eddie III, but I don't see a way to add the release date here. Also, it is not an import. The disc was manufactured in Glenside, PA."
1,Keep Away!,"For the cost, an extremely flimsy proposition. I have worn three of these panty hoses and each has unfailingly developed a run on the first day of wear."
4,"Looks natural, but snags","I love these because they are so sheer that it looks as if you are not wearing anything at all. However, they tear very easily so you have to be careful. It is likely that you may wear them 3 or 4 times if you are super careful, otherwise you may only get 1-2 uses out of them before you have an accident and they tear. They are also non-irritating to the skin and feel very comfortable."
1,Stocking Ran Immediately,These stockings ran almost immediately upon putting on. I pull then up and they fit well. I took a few steps and felt the run. It was really disappointing since I live overseas and getting the right color is difficult. I think they may have been dry rot.
1,BOOOOOOO,Only ordered it so my daughter could learn a little more realistic history on Makaoto for a school project...It sux
3,Enjoyable but riddled with flaws...,"This movie brings me back, I watched it alot as a kid and I still love the movie but there are some flaws that I notice now that when I was little I failed to notice. There are alot of historical flaws (no fort looks like it was built with boards from a Home Depot) and the main villain suffers from a bad costume wig. It does look cheap at some parts but still, the acting is very good and Sandrine Holt makes a beautiful Pocahontas. This is a fantastic movie for families but if you want a deeper movie about Pocahontas I'd suggest getting A New World instead."
2,interprative filmaking,"I have attended many shows at the Mass college of art film devision and I have to say this reminds me of a student film project, just by the way its all put together,lighting effects,sound and acting, its all kind of interperative. I am a die hard gorehound and after reading many online reviews I thought I was gonna be in gore heaven (or hell,giving what this film deals with), but alas it just didn't deliver enough for me, the make up effects were good not great, there was some attention to detail missing and there were really only two gory scenes in the film, they kept going back repeatedly to show the same scene over and over, I would have liked to have seen more different scenes of bloody violence...all in all at the end I just sat for minute and thought ""that's it"", I don't see what all the hoopla is about this film. In my opinion, if you want alot of gore like me check out the older films of Olaf Ettinbach, he delivers plenty of the gory goods on a low budget."
1,now i now why cops stop me for no reason...,"it's because of books like this. randall robinson and david duke are on opposite poles of the same page. stop hatin', and start lovin'!!!! god is the way."
1,A disgrace,Max Robinson was a joke as a newscaster and a disgrace as a person. His brother has kept his legacy intact.
3,Good overview of American foreign policy,"This book is not so significant for its detailing of racism in America, which both white and black surely know of. Rather, it is a lovely view at how American foreign policy holds Africa and the Carribean to be simple pawns in their games, not caring for the countries involved nor their residents. Mr. Robinson, founder of TransAfrica, does a fine job criticizing policy to Rhodesia, Haiti, Rwanda, Zaire (now the Congo once more), Jamaica, Nigeria and more. Angry at times, but often rightfully so. Robinson does a fine job using personal experiences to highlight his message. Worth reading for Americans of all skin colors and backgrounds."
3,"EXCELLENT EXCEPT FOR HANDLE ""CONNECTION""","The set arrived with one fork's handle off. As other reviews said,that connection is faulty. However the weight, design, etc is very nice and well made."
5,Yummmy,"Wow, the folks at NotLame Records have done it again. This label is home to some great power pop bands and churns out some great compilations! I love collections like this, because they're all about the hit. Granted there are some definite rarities here, but these songs were from the time when you cranked out a ""hit"" and then if it did well, you released an album. Anyway, this is a great collection of bands having a lot of fun with some classic bubblegum. There's not a dud in the bunch and these will definitely lift your spirits-- if you've been listening to too much Joy Division and you're thinking about killing yourself, then you better buy this disc fast.BONUS: Got young kids? KIDZBOP make you want to cross the center line while driving? Buy this disc. It gets three thumbs up from the backseat."
4,Communications Systems and Networks,A wonderful and essential book for all telecom engineers. It is a great work that should have scored my 5 but for the paper quality.
4,A good book,"This is a good book, I also found Broadband Networking, ISBN 007219510X, to be very good and more current."
2,Hard to follow,"Although this book has a ton of great information, personally, I found it hard to follow. It was confusing and the length of the chapters were a little overwhelming. I had this book for a class and ended up using the internet rather than the book to do my work. I have taken a very basic networking class in the past and the book was laid out MUCH better and was much easier to understand. I wouldn't suggest this to someone who knows little to nothing about networking unless they want to invest a lot of time reading and re-reading to fully understand."
3,Advanced for beginners,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a network/telephony person. I have no background in it and I have very little work experience in that arena. Thus, I was looking for a book that would teach me the fundamentals of how telecom networks are structured in a clear and simple manner, but also deal with advanced topics. I was disappointed in this book because the author assumed a great deal of prior knowledge. The text was littered with acronyms and terminology from the very beginning, making it hard to follow. Also, the progression of the chapters did not make much sense to me. A person with a baseline familiarity of telecoms may have an easier time with the text. Also, I found the writing style difficult to follow. The text was very dry and the paragraphs seemed to jump around a lot; there was not a clear flow of ideas. If you're a total beginner, I wouldn't recommend this book. If you're familiar with telephony and want a deeper understanding, this might be a good choice."
5,Communications Systems and Networks,"Horak does it again, a Three-Pete, (with your permission MJ). Once again Horak makes a very complex subject so easy to understand and assimilate. As the CEO of an international Internet security consulting firm, I highly recommend this book as an additional to you reference library. Whether you provide complex solutions to Global 2000 companies, or you are just beginning to understand the transport medium that has driven a whole new economy, Buy It. It's worth its weight in Gold, and then some."
2,An Awful Introduction,"I'm an electrical engineer and in the Telecomm buisness. I've read a lot of books on communications and this has to be one of the worst, luckily I didn't pay for it. The writing is poor and it doesn't commuicate ideas clearly. There is better books out there on the exact same subject."
2,Difficult Read,"Barely got through the first chapter. If you enjoy languid, descriptive writing then this book is perfect for you. Do not read if you have a ""wandering"" mind."
1,Great story--Archaic translation,"This translation is not new; it's a copy of an early 20th century translation that is archaic and not a translation at all so much as a transliteration. Just ""Look Inside"" at the first page of text: the awkward syntax and poor grammar that only a crude translation could render. Zola was the ultimate stylist and if you think this poor version is what he intended, you don't know French lit very well. This publisher is not what it purports to be."
5,this si an excelent cd,I really enjoyed this cd.The singer is very versitile and his arrangements superb.I think any one would enjoy this as it would appeal to all ages.Looking forward to his next project.
4,Subtle tones for a rainy afternoon,"Ive found the lyrics settling & peaceful, in a day & age of harsh ,abrassive music. The band is tight ,& musically compitent.. both the Artist & the musicians show diversity & talent in this eclectic but romantic display of un-plugged vocals soothing acoustic & well balanced production. Grab a Blanket , the cat ,A warm cup of tea... sit out on the porch as a sunday afternoon rainstorm washes over the awning...& enjoy Random White Boy!"
4,A pleasant diversion in an increasingly abrassive medium,"i listen to music from Andrea Bocelli....to Ziggy Marley,.......from acid rock to zamfir's pipes.. I find Random White Boy provides a smooth , comforting array of soft vocals & slick production.This album is musically tight & thoughtfully delivered........place a remote speaker on the porch.....find a comfortable chair,warm blanket....your favorite Cat,a cup of Herbal Tea...& feel your stress level drop 4 nothches. Well done Kirk!"
4,Captures the imagination,The story took me back to my own childhood. Kim has a way of using few words so well that the story pours out before you. She is a great new talent in writing.I loved the shift from first to third person that gave the many complex views of a complex yet touching tale.It is a must read.
1,Hope this helps,but it probably won't help. I got bored half-way through this book and wanted to throw it in the trash can. She failed to keep my interest for some reason and I couldn't tell you what it was except that there was too much emotion and feeling to keep track of. This is why Kim succeeds at being a woman and does not succeed as a man - too much emotion and feeling which does not for me make a good story.
2,There's just something about it...,"Let me first say that I have not heard the entire CD. I've only heard one or two songs that are played on my Satellite Radio.The song that gets the most play is ""Common Spirit"" and I'm sad to say that this is one of those rare songs (like Lila Floods: The Ocean Refuses No River) that when it comes on, I cringe and scramble to turn the channel.I don't know what it is, but the hokey introduction to ""Common Spirit"" scratches a nerve in me and makes it seems like I'm shopping in a badly lit grocery store rather than grooving to some mellow music.Sorry Faruk, not your best work."
3,excellent and enjoyable way to learn about the buddha,"beautiful poetry. a long poem that you will not be able to put down until it is finished. many passages are so beautiful you will pick this book up after you have finished and reread you favorite parts. also, very educational. i recommend this for anyone who would like to learn about buddhism and wants to do it in a VERY entertaining way."
5,Such books make life worth living. A master piece.,It is a narration of the Life and Teachings of Buddha written by divine inspiration by Edwin Arnold. Rev Angarica the founder of Mahabodhi Society was deeply inspired by this book whereafter he took the Buddhist Robes. I have read the book several times and propose to read it many more times. Each reading elevates you some what. Any one who wants the book for free may contact me atnavinkumar@hotmail.com.
3,Brief excerpt from text,"WHO THWARTS IT LOSES, AND WHO SERVES IT GAINS.THE HIDDEN GOOD IT PAYS WITH BLISS,THE HIDDEN ILL WITH PAINS.SIR EDWIN ARNOLD, ""LIGHT OF ASIA"""
2,Fair printed Version,It was a fair printing of this book but the free version on the internet was much easier to read and comprehend at UrbanDharma.org.
4,Merman in The Raw,"This is the beginning of what I hope will be a series of CDs that will bring Merman fans her rarest and best recordings. Although it might have been helpful to tell listeners that the medley tracks were made by Ethel for her then-fiance Ernest Borgnine (and recorded with Goldie Hawkins at the piano), these rare glimpses of Merman singing pop love songs is priceless. Likewise the songs from ""Happy Hunting."" Although the ""Gypsy"" demos have already been released, the ""Hello Dolly"" cuts are something I never thought I'd hear on CD. It is too bad Merman's live versions (recordings are available) of these songs weren't included, but perhaps they are forthcoming. Note to the producers: how about Ethel's work on Verve, and the full version of her live album? Ethel fans are going to love this one!"
3,Better to just buy Pandora,"Love Anne Rice and was eager for both stories. Loved Pandora and would give that one 5 stars. Still pushing through Vittorio because I paid for it, but it's moving sooooo slow and the characters are not that engaging for me."
2,it makes the camera looks different,"the .5x Wide Angle and the 2x Telephoto HD2 Lens, only makes the camera look different. the lens packaging shows there will be a noticeable difference with the recorded videos. nothing changed just the depth of field for a close up shot shows the edge of the lens. i did several test shots with and without the lens and the recorded videos are the same."
1,You can have the wide angle adapter if vignette doesn't bother you.,"I bought the Opteka 0.5X wide angle adapter for my Panasonic SDC-SD5 HD Camcorder last year but never used. Reason: Terrible vignette when the camera lens is set at its widest angle. This 0.5X wide angle adapter is simply for those who are not bothered by the four super dark corners in the widest wide-angle shots. When the adapter was designed, Opteka had chosen the lightness over avoiding vignette. What a shame!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!,"I eagerly anticipated this DVD. It would have been great to see the Kinks in performance. So as soon as I got it I put it on and selected ""Waterloo Sunset"" to watch. What a load of you-know-what. First, it's not the Kinks. It's Ray. Which might be fine, but is not what is advertised. Second, and more importantly, you see/hear very little of the actual performance as some bimbo host is talking over it constantly and the performance cuts away to her. And I don't think the whole song plays either, even in the background. The same is true for ""Lola,"" which cuts away to other people and is also not the Kinks.To be honest, I didn't watch the rest of the DVD and don't know that I will because what I did see made me so crazy. So my advice is STAY AWAY!!! And if I could give it minus stars/less than one star I would."
1,Dead time stories,This movie was very disappointing.First of all I bought it brand new from Amazon.comand it was only a dvd-r disc(cheaper form of DVD).Secondly the print quality was very bad.I got strange new world(1987 VHS)from Amazon.co.uk and the print quality of that was better than dead time stories.In the end I couldn't watch it and had to throw away the disc.I have bought 150 aprox movies from Amazon.com and am very satisfiedhowver Dead time stories is not one of them.
3,good add on,this was a good add on to my hypoid but it doesn't come with the screw to hold it in place. nothing a trip to the hardware store couldn't fix but while i was their they had the rule instock and with a screw... slightly a pain.
4,Guilty Pleasures Galore,"""Vampires of Sorority Row"" (Bovine Productions, 1999) is another entry in the deathless vampire genre, this time with pretty girls chasing each other, spanking each other, biting each other. It's the sort of movie that would make a straight-laced critic retch. But for those who like sexy, post-pubescent hijinks laced with suspense and a little satire, it's a pleasant enough way to spend an hour and a half.The plot? There isn't any. Not much, anyway. Three pretty girls pledge a sorority, only to discover that the initiation process requires humiliation and pain. To make matters worse for the pledges, some of the sorority sisters are vampires who do their best to bite them on the neck. Some succeed, some don't. And that's about it for story line.But the girls are gorgeous, the visuals are first-rate, and that's enough to make ""Vampires of Sorority Row"" one of the brightest of guilty pleasures. Recommended for men (and some women) with a sense of humor and 90 minutes to kill."
4,Maybe the most LOUD recording in HUMAN history!!,THIS IS SO LOUD!!!!!!!!!! LOUD!!!!!!!!!!This was a quick little MURDER from my brother's in DISMEMBER..the king's of DEATH FUKKING METAL!!!JUST BE PREPARED TO HAVE YER FACE REMOVED!!!!!!!!MANDATORY..from back when NUCLEAR BLAST(the label) RULED!!! they now SUCK the big one!!!
5,Refreshingly different,"Really enjoyed this one. The host offers a different perspective than what you would normally expect out of a travel video, so keep this in mind."
2,With plenty of cheese,"This DVD is worth, maybe, 99 cents. Cheap production, half as long as it should be. Buy a good travel book and leave this DVD for the scrap heap.I wish I had saved my money."
5,Superb,"I've been a fan of McGhee's soulful writing since I picked up her book Shadow Baby from my local library. In that book, I fell in love with Clara winter, and now I've fallen in love with William T. Jones. McGhee creates a world that my mind never leaves upon finishing her books. It stays with me--a feeling, an image, sometimes a sadness. This is a worth follow-up to Shadow Baby, and I will eagerly await another book from this very talented writer."
2,Terribly disappointed...,"I desperately wanted to enjoy this book. I had loved ""Rainlight"", and enjoyed seeing a few of the characters from the author's previous novel come alive again, later on in their own stories.However, both the protagonist and prose were very difficult to ""read"" (metaphorically and literally), and left me just hoping the novel would progress. It simply didn't. This was a confusing and disappointed book, told by an author I truly admire."
1,Watch out--full of mistakes,"In the section of this book mentioning the English mystic Anna Kingsford (1846-1888), many mistakes are made.The author says Anna's father was of French descent: no, it was Italian descent.Anna's father died in 1865, not 1867, and she died in 1888 not 1885 as stated.Her collaborator, Edward Maitland did not call her a ""blonde goddess"", he said she had flowing golden hair, the envy of a goddess.Anna did not dominate or boss Edward Maitland, as stated by the author, who also gets page references wrong.My information comes from""The Life of Anna Kingsford"" by Maitland, a source misquoted by Washington.I havn't the inclination to investigate further errors in this book, which must be many judging from the eight pages I investigated.The author sensationalizes much of his subject matter, to the detriment of objectivity.If you read this book, take care."
1,I thought scholarship meant impartiality?,Any attempt to write a book looking at history in a different way is good. I wish he had spent more time trying to present facts instead of injecting his own opinion. In the end he just sounded fanatical. (shrug) I guess we all have to make a living somehow.
2,"sorry, your anti New Age bias is showing...","its the age of pathography, or the tearing apart biographical writing that uses pretentitious deep scholarship and wild pamphleteering exquisitely sewn together. Its funny however that most of the attacks are against the New Age movements. What about the Christian fundamentalists? Are they less ridiculous or dangerous? Why bother about the largely forgotten Blavatsky when the real taking over of America is being brewed by bible belt looneys? A book like this looks like a real diversion tactic..."
3,"Uneven, mildly engaging and informative","This book begins well but begins to lose steam midway through and never recovers. Over half the book concerns people other than HPB (Krishnamurti, Besant, etc), and the earlier parts of the book that do focus on her are not all that extensive."
2,Too Biased!,"This book is about political infighting between early members of the Theosophical Society, its offshoots and similar groups. It bearly discusses the philosophies these various people espoused. I am neither a theosophist nor an anti-theosophist, but had heard of the people discussed in the book and was interested in learning more. I didn't learn what I wanted to know, though: What were these people's philosophies? How did they develop their teachings and how did one system compare to another? I guess Mr. Washington would perhaps call his book an expose. But I don't understand why an author who seems to sneer at these theories would even want to write a book tearing down other people's beliefs and religions. What happened to live and let live?"
1,contemptuous,"I'm no follower of the people this book is about, but I wouldn't have picked it up unless I thought I'd get some reasonable objective information from it. Washington has the most contemptuous tone imaginable, often labeling the subjects of his books as pederasts and such. Makes me wonder what his real reason was for writing the book; I didn't get through very much of it."
1,Factually inaccurate,"The author presumes to understand the workings and life of Blavatsky in a way that hundreds, if not thousands of others don't. It has been mentioned in other reviews the book has factual inaccuracies. I need only give one. The author records Madames death in 1909. This is also the case during a televised interview with the author. This is inaccurate. Madame Blavatsky died May,8 1891. She was cremated at Woking Crematiorium, Surrey, England. Anyone with an internet connection is able to verify this for him or herself. If this one fact alone is inaccurate, what of the rest of the text?"
4,Not great after a year,"I first reviewed this product and said it was great. Overall it has been a fine unit, but it seems to everheat once in a while during a long DVD session. From time to time the movie will freeze up, and then jump forward or backward, very annoying. Considering how inexpensive the unit is for VCR and DVD, it was still an OK value, but the overheating seems to be a fatal flaw."
2,Impossible remote,"I have a degree in Computer Science from U.C. Berkeley, so I'm not usually intimidated by technology. But this remote is just impossible. Lots of tiny, identical buttons with microscopic labels. You can only use the remote using reading glasses in a strong light. Many of the controls are non-intuitive even when you find the right buttons. The manual is strikingly unhelpful; one of the worst I've seen.I actually bought a universal remote but this deck wouldn't respond to it at all.(Rant: user interface design is a well-understood discipline, so why is it that user interfaces seem to be getting worse rather than better?) Anyway, I returned it and got a JVC XVC33U, which is much easier to use and has a vastly better manual."
2,DEFECTIVE LASER,"THIS UNIT WORKED GREAT FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR, THEN THE DVD LASER JUST WENT. THE THING PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE 50 HRS OF PLAY TIME ON IT AND HAS BEEN WELL TAKEN CARE OF. PANASONIC BASICALLY SAYS ""TOUGH S..."", THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED. THIS IS B.S. AS THE UNIT IS ONLY A LITTLE OVER A YEAR OLD. I WILL NEVER BY ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM PANASONIC. I NOW HAVE A $170.00 PEICE OF JUNK."
2,DVD Player does not work,I bought this DVD combo because wanted to have 1 device that will play my old VHS tapes and didn't wanted a new device just for DVD's.It turn out that I might need to buy separate devices since this is my second combo unit (different brand) and in both cases the DVD player was faulty.Had to give them 2 stars since the VHS player does work.Great unit if you can get the DVD player to work.
3,Still looking...,"I bought this unit at Best Buy two years ago after lightning destroyed my old VHS player. On sale, $129. It still works as advertised. A few quirks I always forget: Many of the on-screen menu options show up only on the composite video output, so you HDTV component video users can't set the clock without running more wires. Seems like it doesn't play a lot of formats, I often get the old ""can't play this disc, please insert another disc"". So if Aunt Martha sends you her home movies on DVD+R, you will need another player besides this one. I plan on replacing this combo unit with a more versatile one next year. But, hey, it still works!"
2,Played OK until it broke,"This was an OK model until the VCR part stopped working a little after a year. I made the mistake of taking it to a Panasonic authorized repair shop where they charged me almost as much as I paid in the first place to fix it. It also took them about 2 months to fix. The sad thing is that within 6 months later it had the same problem.Since all of the combo players available anymore appear to be pieces of crap made over in Asia I bought a Sony from a retailer that offers an extended warrantee. I figure the extra cost is less then the cost of a repair or a new one, and I will be very surprised if it still works in three years."
3,Space Saver but I Miss my Sony,"I bought this unit to save space by combining my vcr and dvd. Plus I wanted to get progressive scan. This unit works very well. The progressive scan output is awesome. But the menu displays are juvenile and the remote is confusing. Overall the unit works great and does what I need it to do, but I miss my 2 separate Sony pieces."
1,Terrible!,"I had the first one for about 2 weeks and the VHS part broke. I received a replacement and the same thing happened. In about 2 weeks the VHS part broke again with the same problem. The tape doesn't go in all the way and it eats the tape. I called Panasonic regarding fixing it. They were terrible. I closest repair center was over an hour away and if I were to ship it, I would have to pay for shipping both ways. They were not apologetic about it either. It should not break in 2 weeks! Nonetheless 2 of them!"
3,WHY CANT I COPY A DVD TO VHS!!!!????,"I just bought this unit. It seems to DO everthing--it will play (SOME )jpeg dvds, some WINDOWS media that I could only play previously on my computer. The VHS remote has tracking ON the remote--ALL GOOD features. WARNING: WHY CANT I DUB from DVD to VHS directly???? The UNIT says AUTOIMATICALLY ""WARNING CANNOT COPY from DVD TO VHS COPYRIGHT"" and you are STUCK. you cant make a VHS copy from a DVD. NOW--BEFORE you all scream ""you used a COPYWRITTEN DVD..NO I DID NOT!! I usded an UNCOPYWRITTEN DVD and tried to make a VHS copy, and the machine AUTOMATICALLY EWONT ALLOW IT!!!"" does anyone know what ican do to correct this problem without having to DUB to ANOTHER off line VHS unit? thanks--please reply off line if possible as well. JEWELBLUES@aol.com Otherwise--i can srtill get a REFUND on the item. I cannot comment o nthe rest of the unit. I just think this AUTOMATIC BLOCK is SO STUPID ESPECIALLY when you try to COPY a NON COPYWRITTEN DVD to VHS!!!"
5,"Nick Carter Album ""Now or Never""","That album rock. If you think is your Backstreet Boy tip of music....Your not even close to it. It's take you in you're wild memories when you listen to "" My Confession"", "" I Stand for you"" and ""Help Me"" in those teenage years. If you like Lenny Kravitz, Bon Jovi and Bryan Adams you will love this album just like those BSB fans like myself or Nick fans too.For those Nick Carter fans or those crazy lover of him just like me as an example...The DVD part is worth it. Trust me on that. It's better spend a couple of dollar more to not regret at all much later. You got the same songs on the album but plus a DVD of 35 minutes of him.And it will be a good Christmas gift."
5,Best CD of All Time,"One word to describe Nick's CD, ""Now Or Never""... WOW! This is one of those cds that you leave in your cd player on repeat for months at a time. It's also a great cd for rolling down your windows in your car and turning it up loud to sing along. The songs will make you want to cry... then suddenly get up and start dancing around the room. ""I Got You"" is one of the best songs, because it is a ballad, and at the same time it's upbeat. ""Blow Your Mind"" is another one of my favorites... it almost has a Bon Jovi feel to it. If you haven't bought this cd yet... BUY IT NOW!"
5,Hearing the Millenium Singer,"I am one of the hugest fans of Nick Carter and BACKSTREET BOYS. I would really recommend this cd for it's many songs relates to every day life. It teaches you how a guy might feel or a girl might feel and yet at the same time, helps your problems be resolved by a single song or even a tweleve track cd. Please, hear me out when I say, by buying Nick Carter's ""Now Or Never"",it can make your life easier and it is not just one song but a lot of which you may not hear again. GO NICK CARTER AND BACKSTREET BOYS FANS AROUND THE WORLD. HELP NICK WITH HIS DEBUT ALBJUM. SHOW HIM HOW MUCH WE LOVE AND APPRECIATE HIM. THANKS."
5,Now or Never is absolutely a NOW,"The New debut solo album from Nick Carter titled 'Now Or Never'Is an incredible Cd everyone must buy,each song is a new and different sounding melody. Nick's talent shines through in every word he soulfuly sings, his rang of vocals are above outstanding.This album is a must have, its an album any gerneration can listen to and enjoy together. After listening to this amazing Cd, you will be sure to have a smile upon your face."
5,Nick Carter's Now or Never Soars,"Nick Carter steps out of the band and into the spotlight as a solo artist with his debut album ""Now or Never."" Nick displays great talent on this album and demonstrates his individuality as an artist. This album has it all, from rocking tunes to ballads, with the fun tune ""Is It Saturday Yet?"" thrown in for good measure. Nick proves himself the be a force to be reckoned with on this album. His smooth voice makes the album pleasing to the ear. I'm sure this album is the first of many to come."
5,Excellent,"I thought this was an example of an excellent talent at work. I thought that he did a great job in jumping from pop to rock and back. I definately think he did a great job on this cd. I loved the song ""My Confession"" and the up beat sound of ""Blow Your Mind"" I also enjoyed the ballads ""Heart Without a Home(I'll Be Yours)"" and ""Who Needs The World"""
5,GO GET THIS CD!!,"This Cd was in one word... AMAZING! I would suggest anyone who hasn't already boughten it, to go get it!! You will love every song on it! Nick has really out done him self this time, and if you read his Thank yous.. he dedicated the CD to the rest of the backstreet boys.. its so awesome! Go get it!!"
5,"Nick Carter, Artist of the ""Millennium""","Nick's album, ""Now or Never"", is the dream longtime fans have been waiting for!! This rock-influenced album, jam-packed with vocals that rival Bon Jovi's and amazing guitar riffs, is essentially Nick in his element. From his debut single, ""Help Me"", to the heartfelt ballad ""Heart Without a Home"", Nick proves his vocals can handle more than just pop. While showing that his rock influence fits seamlessly into the music, Nick's voice exudes emotion unseen in most musicians his age.Nick also dispels the belief that he's not just a singer; in fact, he co-wrote five tracks on the album. His collaborations with other musicians and writers show the range of his skills as a songwriter and the growth of his emerging talent and style...."
5,Success,"To tell the truth, I didn't expect Nick to be that good without other Backstreet boys but really he showed that he has his own style and sense of music. Most of all I liked the style of music, it's something really new and fresh.Good job, Nick!!"
5,Buy this!!!!!,"This debut solo album is great. All the songs are catchy and there are several stand out classics that you will love like, I Got You, Confession, Help Me, Do I Have to Cry for You. I swear, if he re released Girls In The U.S.A. today, it could be a summertime hit. Just buy this, don't even think about, especially at this current price...its a steal deal and I would pay three times as much for it. I Love Nick Carter! KTBSPA!!! By the way, if you have not already...Buy Nicks latest solo album, I'm taking Off. It is incredible."
4,MMMMM...NICK CARTER,"Nick Carter is a very talented young man, he has great taste in music and he can be his own man even without the backstreet boys. His new cd ""Now or Never"" could be a little better, but is great for a guy who has just gone solo. His song ""Help Me"" melts my heart he sings so great in that song. He is a great singer and probably will continue to go further into his singing career."
3,Backstreet Boy Break Out,"Nick Carter trys hopfully to break out of his long time shell of boy band hood but unfortunatly hes not accompleshing it too well. His cd Now or Never is good but not the best and with his group of the past not surfacing for the last 2 years, hes fallin behind. Nick's new ""rock"" is still leaving us with mixed feelings. Are you grown up yet or just pretending, Nick? All in all if you were a fan you'll buy it to show support cuz every backstreet fan wants to have them beat out Nsync even if they have to start one band member at a time. If not, after you hear it 2 times you'll throw it out your car window and ask yourself ""What in the world just happend?"""
5,Absolutly GREAT,"I love this album. I'e loved the backstreet boys so I thought I'd like this one too. I'm in love with this cd the minute I heard it. I couldn't stop listening to it. My favorite song on the album is ""Miss America"" it brings out his voice that he couldn't use before he went solo."
5,BLOW YOUR MIND,"Nick Carter's ""Now or Never"" will absolutely blow you away! The vocals are amazing and the beats are jumping! I expected this album to be great anyway, but even I am amazed. Nick delivers tracks like ""Do I Have to Cry for You"" and ""Heart Without a Home"" with such intensity and passion you can feel the emotion. The catchy tunes of songs like ""Help Me"" and ""I Just Want to Take You Home"" will stay in your head for hours after the cd stops. And I don't know about you...but ""I'll Stand For You"" just makes me want to get in the car and drive. So many critics were certain the breaking away from the Backstreet Boys for this album would lead to disaster, but Nick has really pulled off a masterpiece with ""Now or Never"". Don't miss out...buy your's today!"
5,Now or Never? Definately now,"This CD is awesome, the tracks are varying and different. They show a little bit of all the sides of Nick. ""Now or Never"" has soft ballads, up beat rock songs and everything in between. The song ""Help Me"" is merely a sneak peak into the world of Nick. The album has so many more great songs than just his first, including his next single ""Do I Have To Cry For You"" which gives the world their first taste of Nick's writing capabilities."
5,"The not new, but improved NICK CARTER","Like everybody else I've been waiting for this album for ages. Now the time has come!! So the question now is, DO I LIKE IT???Well that's a big YES! I love it. Nick has made this album typically him. He's put his ideas, his music, and his lyrics, with the help of some very distingished people, into a package that shouts SUCCESS!!!!All in all it's a divers selection of songs that show what kind of person Nick Carter is. At this moment he's not part of a group, he can personally select all songs for his album. Like my title said this is not a new NC, but a different and personal NC. Good job and keep it up Nick!! For this album you'll get my 5 stars and I believe that a lot of people will agree with me."
5,Now Or Never Is AMAZING,"If you haven't purchased Nick Carter's new CD what are you waiting for?!....let me just say that this album is awesome, it has alot of rock influences on it....the ballads are breathtaking, I can honestly say the songs made me cry....the fast songs are upbeat and dancy....Nick is just off the chain....I can't get enough of this CD, ever since I bought it I have been listening to it over and over....One of my favorite songs is ""I Got You""....he's just amazing and he sounds wonderful, go out and buy the CD, I give it 2 thumbs up and 10 stars!"
1,Conspiracy!,"I think Nick's people must have paid all these reviewers to rave about his album; I've never before seen an album that performed so poorly on the charts have not only so many reviews (almost 1,000!) but so many positive reviews - only 7 (including this one) out of almost 1000 reviews gave this disc 1 star! I've only heard one song from this disc (Help Me) and his voice is vastly underdeveloped and raspy, so that leads me to the conclusion that these rave reviews are all bogus; there probably aren't even 1,000 people who own this album! If you're going to purchase this album, first find an actual veritable source (if there actually is one) who can confirm whether or not that would be a wise decision - don't take these Amazon reviews to heart!"
5,Highly Underrated,"This album is sooo amazing that I still listen to it years later! It's such a shame that there was so much hype with Justin Timberlake that Nick's album didn't sell that well. If people really knew how much better this album is compared to anything Justin has done, Nick would be the the limelight more often."
5,Nicks better than ever !!,I am sitting here with Nick Carters new CD Now or Never...just hit stores today !It is a great solo effort on behalf of Backstreet boys youngest member 22 year old Nick Carter.I think a lot of critics think Nick wont make it on his own but let me tell you I have news for them.I really love the Song Heart without a home ( Ill be yours )Its a great Rock ballad a little like a Bon Jovi love song. I think Nick has a great future a head of him in the Rock and Roll field.Great job Nick......I am off to listen to the rest of my new favorite CD Now or Never
5,NOW OR NEVER RULEZZZZZZZZ,"this CD is number one, no one better. The CD shows you into the soul of nick carter. The music is upbeat with its love songs. Love songs that are full of the universal feelings of love and confusion. THIS CD ROCKS SO YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!..."
5,not the Baby Backstreet anymore...,"Nick Carter's new cd ""Now or Never"" has got to be one of the best CD's I've bought in a long time. It has a very diverse range of songs, such as a more rock tone, to a slower tone, and even a little mix of the 70's type beat. It's very un-bsb like, which is good. It's letting Nick do his thing, which is very awesome. Even people who dislike the boy band theme will enjoy some part of this song. Its a very grown up- yet fun album. IT's not a typical pop cd. I think that even if i wasn't a fan, or if I hadn't known anything about Nick (ya know, living under a rock...) and I had gotten this cd, I'd be very stunned that THIS guy IS in a BOY BAND. I'm loving this cd 100% and I'd reccommend it to anyone who likes anytype of pop or poppy rock."
5,IT WAS AMAZING!,"The songs are totally him and they express what he really feels. You can tell because he wrote some of the songs himself. When you hear him sing, it's like he's right there and reaching out to you. I can relate to a lot of the songs because I am a teenager and I feel that way sometimes. The songs rock, he has an amazing voice and the album was just sooooooooooooo good!"
5,Nick's Gonna leave ya speechless!!,"Nick did it again, his PHENOMENAL voice and writing talents make up the masterpiece that is ""Now Or Never""! Weither you want to hear a sweet ballad coming straight from the heart like ""Who Needs The World, or a song to get ya up and dancing like ""Girls In The Usa"" you'll surely be pleased either way!! Only Nick's INCREDIBLE voice could pull something this GREAT off, and believe me, he definitley pulled it off!!! It's easy to compare simillar styles of music together but no one can compare with Nick, as you hear every track on the album, not only will you hear his incredible voice, you'll also hear a lot of heart and passion as he sings every word to every song, something most entertainers lack! This man was born to do this, and trust me he's the BEST at it!"
5,Nick Carter's Now Or Never Rocks!,"This CD is awesome. The first reason being that Nick did an awesome job co-writting half the songs on it. There are songs on here that appeal to every kind of music listener. With songs like ""I Stand For You"" and ""Blow Your Mind"" for the rockers. And songs like ""Do I Have to Cry For You"" and ""Who Needs The World"" that appeal to the backstreet boys fans. All in all this CD has great lyrical content and awesome music you can rock out to while you driving or whatever."
5,Nick Carter,"Nick, you totally did your thing and did a fantastic job!!I can listen to your CD over and over again and love it more each and every time. It's fun and uplifting. I hear some Bon Jovi and Bryan Adams in there, but ""it's all you"" and that's what makes it great. I'm definitely ""FEELIN"" the Miss America song. I'd love to be the woman you're singing that to in the up and coming video for Miss America. Great job!!!!!!"
5,Best I've Ever Heard!,"""Now or Never"" is an amazing cd and I'm really proud of Nick. This solo project of his really allowed everyone to see what a talented musician he is. I think Amazon.com's comparison between Nick and Justin was right on when they stated that Nick's cd was a true solo cd because it's all Nick and not Nick and other artists. He's got his awsome raspy voice and you can hear how much he's matured since the Black and Blue cd. His sound is so different than that of the pop sound and I recommend this cd to any one who likes rock music! It is awsome!"
5,Wow!,"I didn't really what to expect with Nick coming out with a solo album. I mean so many other ppl are comin' out w/ solo albums so he got quite a bit of competition to get thru but when I heard it, I was like WHOA! Every song sounds different.. it's not the same as some artists might have. There are diff. beats and different styles all meshed into one and it just works. and thankfully, u're not hit by all the cheesy love lyrics... they are more about life and havin' fun if anything. Get this CD, it's a catchy one."
5,YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS ALBUM!,"omg this album is the BEST ever...seriously, I love EVERY single song on it...I'm sure you'll love it too. go buy it!!"
5,Amazing Solo Cd from Nick,"Now Or Never by Nick Carter is a great cd!! The songs are all very catchy and after you hear them once, it's hard to get them out of your head. Nick has always had an amazing voice, and it really shines through in songs like ""Do I Have To Cry for You"" and ""Heart Without A Home"". The cd has a mix of ballads and happy party songs, and all of the songs are all well written. As always, Nick makes each song his own and puts his all into them. A few of the songs were even written by Nick himself, which makes them even more personal. This is the best cd I've heard in a while and you would not be wasting your money by buying it."
4,Now or Never,"Nick Carter. When i think of Nick Carter i think of how far he has come and how he has made his dream come true. Hearing him sing in his new album Now or Never, i can hear how much passion he's putting towards his songs. This CD is nothing like Backstreet Boys like everyone suspects it to be. In the ballads you can hear just a little bit of the Backstreet Boy in him coming out, but mostly rock. His CD rocks! Buy it! You'll love it!"
5,Amazing,Nick's new album is so good. The songs are so sincere and seem like they have a lot of meaning to them. You can tell a lot of work was put into the album and the outcome was great. I'm really excited about his next solo projects because I think they are going to improve.
5,Nick Carter is God,"If you already havent heard the new Nick Carter cd.....u better do so!!From rockish attitude style songs to slow ballads, this cd has been worth the wait! Nick did an awesome job with the new solo cd! Once you listen to it, all you wanna do is listen to it over and over again! Its awesome!! Make sure to get ur copy of Now or Never today!! while they last!**LU**"
3,"Not amazing, but not horrible","I have never really listened to Nick Carter's music and I did't really know who he was until I heard he was with one of the Hilton sisters.I sampled some of his music, and while it isn't the best I've ever heard,it isn't the worst. His voice is ok, I give it 3.5 stars out of 5.Some of the songs are catchy as well."
1,Nick Carter Now or NEVER,I gave this record a chance but I am sorry this is just awful music. If i wanted to listen to a mix of Hanson and the Spice Girls I could just go through my old trash and pop it in! I used to be a fan until i heard this record. What a disappointment!
5,Amazing CD,"Nick Carter's first solo CD is amazing, I love all the songs specially Do I have to cry for you, Help me, Heart without a Home and Who needs the work. The sound of the album is great, is more rock that he usually do with BSB. Nick sings so amazing and so sweet in the balads, he did a very very very good job with his first solo album ."
5,Nick's Now Or Ever Solo Debue,"...I ...have not been able to stop listening to it since. The vocals are extreamly well done and the beats are amazing. ...Also people who were not really into the whole BACKSTREET vibe need this album too because it is very different from the pop vocal harmonies, it is much more rockish. Awesome for driving in the car, I gave this CD ***** because it rocks, literally."
1,wow,"I cant believe how many boy band artist there were, now that I look at it. This solo debut by Nick Carter was just as bad as Justin Timberlake's debut. Normally I give every album a fair chance but this was just horrible, I couldnt finish the CD, that a first for me, since even the bad CD's I finish. There is nothing redemable about this album, and showed on the charts when it debuted at 17 and quickly fell, at least Justin Timberlake debuted at one and has sold 4 million copies so far. Skip this, if you want to listen to teen type music, go to Justin Timberlake or Christina Aguilera."
5,I'm loving Now Or Never!,"I knew ""Now Or Never"" was gonna be huge when I first heard ""Help Me"" on the radio. But nothing can compare to the feeling of hearing all 12 songs for the first time on that little compact disc, the tracks on this album is like nothing I've heard before! His amazing vocals and raw emotion makes Now Or Never at the top of my list. I'd definitely reccomend it to everyone!"
5,A Hot New Album,"This hot new cd from Nick Carter is sure to ""Blow your mind."" I listen to it all the time. It has such a tight edgy sound that anyone is sure to like. It ventures away from the typical Backstreet Boys sound but that's why I like it. I like all the different stlyes of music he has to offer as well, proving that he is capable of singing almost anything. So guys ""Help Me"" and Nick out by checking out his hot new cd. It's ""Now or Never."""
5,personal,"now or never is the brand new album of nick carteras nick is part of a group, the album is very rich of influences and what he learnt from it and togetherthe album has really good writers like Carter, the Matrix, Mark Taylor, Steve Mac, Max Martin and Rami and producers like Martin and Matthew Gerrard and all of them worked out quite well together but what makes you pay attention is the songs sound very personalthey remember you some point of your lifethe songs are happy as pop is, free as rock isthe pop thing makes you happythe rock thing makes you freethe album is all about whatever you wanteach song is better than otherthe album is 'growing up' as you listen to it and getting great and greatin a simple way: good songsgood musicgood albumenjoyable musicit sounds very personal to meit will be to yougo to listen"
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!,"Anyone who enjoys good music will just love Nick Carter's solo album. I just received my copy and was surprised to hear great rock music. All the BSB fans will just love it. Nick has always had a great voice but to hear it alone, was mind-boggling. I encourage everyone to buy this cd and listen to the music, super words and melodies! Max Martin and the rest of Nick's group outdid themselves with this album. I plan on buying more for gifts for my friends. What a great CD!!"
5,Wonderful,Nick has definetly outdone himself with his new solo album! I love the pop/rock songs and the slow songs that comprise this ecstatic album. The guitar is essential on this CD and his voice is edgy with an attitude.
1,Rock It's Not,"Another boy-band member who thinks that just because he's the ""cute one"" he should release his own solo album.Nick Carter goes on and on that his music is different than the Backstreet Boys music and I will have to agree, because at least the Backstreet Boys music was good and I was able to listen to it. This is not rock music and if anyone try's to say it is they're wrong.Once again it proves that just because you write a song doesn't mean you are a good song writer. Nick's lyrics sound like they belong on his even less talented brother Aaron Carter's CD.If you want to witness Nick Carter's true talent buy a BSB CD and hear how good his voice can sound when it's in harmony with his band mates. When he was a BSB his voice had true passion and now it's just trying to be something it's not."
1,Wow... We have a LONG way to go as a society with good music.,"As of today, the average customer rating is 5/5 stars.Boy, those teenyboppers don't know when to accept the BSB and it's members as dead yet, do they?"
1,...,"it's SAD that people are buying this album and actually think it's rock. THIS IS NOT ROCK PEOPLE. IT'S PURE GARBAGE and not the good garbage like the band. No, this is horrible. A waste of time, space and money. Do not buy this worthless crap, buy Pearl Jam or Guns N Roses instead, then you'll know what real ROCK music is. God this is horrible."
1,"Yes, Nick Carter, your career is gone and no one likes you","Jesus Christ, people! Nick Carter? To listen to a song called ""Girls in the USA"" (sung by a 25 year old) is so, so, SO stupid. Buy Justified instead...at least Justin Timberlake acts his age! Nick Carter just sells out to the prepubescent girls, just like his little brother. They both disgust me. You have to have absolutely zero brain cells to listen to this CD---I was hoping America would be a little smarter than this. Obviously, we aren't."
5,"Nick Delivers With ""Now Or Never""","Nick definitely delivers with his first solo album. In ""Now Or Never"" Nick shows off his vocal talents in a wide assortment of musical genres. From the pop sound of ""Help Me"" to the rock sound of ""Girls In The USA"" to the sultry sound of ""Do I Have To Cry For You."" I would have to say that my favourite song on this album is ""Who Nees The World"" because all it is Nick and an accoustic guitar and you can really hear and feel Nick's passion for his music. I would definitely recommend this album and if you are a true Nick Carter fan this is one you don't want to miss out on. The bonus limited edition dvd is also a great plus. One of the things conatained on the dvd is the full length video ""Help Me."" What else does the dvd contain? Well, you will just have to find out for yourself when you get ""Now Or Never"" by Nick Carter. I will tell you that if you love Nick, you will definitely love the bonus limited edition dvd!!!!"
5,Nick Carter's Now or Never,"Nicks solo album is awesome. He wrote a lot of his songs about his life, which I think is good because many people can realte to what he is going through. His music fills my soul and renews it. When I listen to his cd I think about my life and how happy I am:) I am especially happy about life in general and I am happy that I got this cd. Because I can relate to it."
5,Something for Everyone,"While leaning much more towards the rock end of the scale musically, Now or Never takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions. From the fast-paced ,guitar -driven sounds of ""Help Me"" and ""I Stand for You"" to the erotic, blues sounds of ""Miss America"". If your looking for ""Backstreet's Back"" you won't find it here. However, keeping with classic Nick style you will find amazing ballads that will make you wonder why he wasn't a solo artist from the start. Co-writing half of the album's twelve tracks including the incedibly moving ""Do I Have to Cry for You"" Nick Carter proves he's a talent to be taken seriously in the world of music."
5,My confession,I think this is one of his best songs ever I LOVE IT ! I have been a loyal fan for the past 6 years And Im totally hooked on Nick I even have two of his Tattoos on me to prove my dedication.
5,cool cd,"I finally got a copy of the album a year after nick had released it and i still love it till this day 12/01/06 still love all the tracks my fave songs are my confession, do i have to cry for you, i got you, scandolis and heart with out a home, i cannot believe westlife covered that song by nick as well i think it is just a great album for any backstreet boys or nick carter fans."
5,"Nick Carter's ""Now or Never""","I must say that Nick Carter's solo debut, ""Now or Never,"" is one of the best albums I have ever bought. ""Is It Saturday Yet?"" and ""Blow Your Mind"" are fun, rock-y songs to put anyone in a good mood, while ""Heart Without a Home (I'll Be Yours)"" shows Nick has not strayed too far from the sound of BSB, at least in his lighter songs. Other songs like ""I Got You"" and ""Who Needs the World"" speak straight to my heart, and it's nice to know all of these were recorded because Nick believes in what he's singing. There is something for everyone on this album, whether you like rock, pop, or a little bit of country, you are sure to find it here!"
5,Brilliant,"OK - I'm not too good with words - but this album proves that Nick Carter is. There is not one song I dislike. Having loved Help Me when it came out, I was wondering if the album would be as good, it is. He has obviously worked really hard on this and I think his work has paid off. The sound is different to BSB, Nick almost sounding like Bryan Adams. Even with the slightly slower songs having a rock edge to them. Well - thats my opinion, for what its worth. Even if you are not a Backstreet fan - this is well worth listening to - so go and buy it today!!"
5,Nick Carter's solo album ranks high,Nick has truly outdone himself with this incredible new album. The songs that are on it describe him and all that he has been through. The album is something that he has wanted to do for awhile and he is finally able to give his all to his fans. This album is so good that it gave me the chills when I listened to it. Nick sang the songs with so much passion that I actually could feel the emotion of the songs inside me. Not every album is good enough to do that.
4,"Nick Carter is great ""Alone""",This album is great for a first solo venture. Nick has a very strong voice and it shows on the Now or Never CD. This is just the beginning of many more solo songs by Nick Carter. This album is hot.
5,Nick Carter's SPECTACULAR Cd!!!!,"Upon buying this album I knew it was going to be great. The songs on the album have a rock feel and it's absolutely great! On his solo debut album, he has definently shown the world he is an amazing person. This album is so great, if you haven't bought it you should go...right now!"
5,Just As Good As It Could Be!!!!,"I love the cd! At first I thought that the cd wouldn't be really good, even though I'm a huge fan, because he wasn't with BSB anymore. But I bought it anyway and I fell madly in love with it. I don't think that the cd could've gone any better. I give the cd 5 stars because it was not only so good, but it also a pain in the but to find! I would like to say that I am very proud of Nick and that I always knew he could do it!"
5,Nick Carter Proves himself with NOW or NEVER,"Now or Never, by Nick Carter proves he isn't just good as a Backstreet Boy, but is good on his own. This cd has a few pop-ish songs, but the rest stray from the whole ""pop"" image we have of him. This album is a must for any music lover, whether or not you are a Backstreet Boys fan."
5,now or never,"the album is definitely different than what Carter did with the Backstreet Boys. It is edgier, more rock influenced and more from the heart. It blends rock, pop, ballads and some hip hop all into one and is unsurprisingly excellent. Carter manages to go from throaty ballads to upbeat numbers within seconds and is truly remarkable. I recommend this album to everyone, young and old"
2,Just for fans,"it is not really good...But there are one great song: ""miss America"". You have listen to it"
3,Nick Not Backstreet....,"I'm a fan of Nick and I've bought all of The Backstreet Boys albums and singles. I have to be honest here, and say I was rather disappointed with this solo effort by my fave backstreet member. The style he is singing on this solo offering, is quite different to his vocals on the group's records.I just feel this album rather lacks the melody of the boys' pop hits and for me anyway, is rather an acquired taste."
5,What an amazing surprise,"I didn't expect too much from Nick Carter's album but I was so wrong! Most of the songs are really great and very catching.Hopefully, Nick Carter will improve as a solo artist because I'm sure he's got even way more in store.If he'll ever get back with the Backstreet Boys, I just hope that the other BSB guys will give him a chance to deliver and to publish Nick's ""style.""Now Or Never is the best album from any of those ""guys"" that I listened to within weeks.Way to go, Nick Carter!"
1,Wanna be Def Leppard???,Girls In The USA = Pour Some Sugar on Me. Home you asked Leppard for permission. What a complete rip. Go away Backdoor Girls...
5,Must Get CD for any BSB Fan,"Nick Carter's first ever solo album is a huge success. It's songs are expertly written by Nick himself and a team of others. If You are a Backstreet Boys fan I would recomend you go straight out and pick up this Cd as soon as possible. You have your choice of the limited edition or just the normal cd. Either of them are geat. Enjoy such songs as Do I Have To Cry For You, Girls of The USA, and many others. Nick Carter is back big time in this new album. IF you enjoy Rock or Pop music I would say you need to get this album."
5,The Backstreet Baby Is All Grown Up,"Even had I doubted Nick's abilities for a second, I would never have admitted it...because I would have been proven wrong. This kid has some talent...but I'm sure that's no news to all of you. One would listen to this CD expecting to find sugary sweet pop ballads and meaningless lyrics (much like some...*ahem* other groups containing five guys and a recently solo singer who shall remain nameless) but it's not the case with ""Now Or Never"". Nick co-wrote most of the songs on the album, showing not only his creative side, but his depth as well. Not often does a CD come along which is delightful to the ears and intriguing to the mind. Add to this Nick's natural-born gift, and you've got one hell of an equation. The passion in Nick's voice is both striking and genuine. Anyone who passes this one up is insane."
5,Awesome CD,When I first bought Nick Carter's CD I was actually kind of skeptical on how good it actually was going to be but then I started to listen to it and every song got better. It started out amazing and ended up glorious. I so would tell everyone to go out and get this album it is so awesome!
5,Now or Never....Do Yourself A Favor And Buy It.....NOW!,"I picked up Nick's album yesterday, Tuesday, October 29,2002. After buying it I popped it into my car CD player...and couldn't turn it off! This CD is filled with something for everyone's tastes, upbeat songs to get your head boppin as well as a few beautiful ballads. I have to admit that while in my car I must've been bopping my head the whole time because I was getting highly unusual stares from the drivers next to me! I think that everyone can enjoy this album, old, young, pop, or rack fan. It has something for everyone! To put it simply, on a scale of 1-10.....it's definitely an 11! Go get it!"
4,Worth the Price,"Nick has really come forward with some major vocal talent and an awesome attitude! There is some of everything on this album...Nick raps, he rocks, he sings some ballads, he is a pop star, etc. You can really tell he's put his heart into this work. He sounds very Bryan Adams, and I think that was some of his goal. Despite the cheesy reputation he might have, this boy deserves alot of credit for his vocal achievements. Fun to listen to!"
4,Nick's rock ROCKS !!!,"I bought Nick Carter's cd Now Or Never the day it came out. It's not only because I'm a huge fanatic but because I knew it was going to rule. The lyrics to the songs will connect with any young adult or teenager. His harmonies are on perfect key with the beat of the song... if you like songs about love, heart break, fun and the feelings of a young adult's life then be sure to check out the #cd of the year NICK CARTER-NOW OR NEVER!!!"
5,Nick Carter Rocks the World,"Music lovers, do yourself a favor and buy the new CD from Nick Carter entitled ""Now or Never"" - you will thank me! Nick shows both BSB fans and new admirers just how large a range he has on his debut solo effort. 'Help Me' is a wonderful pop-rock song, with a lot of great guitar music and an awesome hook on the chorus. My other favorite songs on this CD include 'My Confession', 'Do I Have to Cry For You' (sweet ballad of longing for true love), 'Girls in the USA' (this song is reminiscent of Bon Jovi and Def Leppard - an awesome rock song), 'I Just Want to Take You Home' (trust me girls, you'd love to have Nick sing this to you), and 'Heart Without a Home'. This CD should mark the start of a very successful solo career for Mr. Carter."
3,I give him 3 stars for effort.....,"Alright this isn't the worse album in the world. But it aint the best i know alot of backstreet fans are going to hate me for saying this but i just thought it was good.This album had so much hype around it...people saying that it was a new sound for nick carter. that he holds his own on his own, that he was going to be a huge solo star, he was experimenting with a rock sound....NO HE WASN'Tthe album is just a bunch of pop songs with a electric guitar added in for that new sound.even thou i didn't think it was great didn't mean there wasn't a few songs that was good.The problem ,one backstreet boy is not as good as 5 backstreet boys. His voice is good but without the boys to back him up he sounds like a teenage girl going through puberty.I hoped for a great album but all i got was a good album. But i give 3 stars for effort."
5,This is a great album!,"i think that nick did a great job with NON, it's totatly a solo album (not like justin's), with great songs and great lyrics, the balads are very beutiful like ""Do i have to cry for you"" and ""Heart without a soul"", u should buy it if u like good music..."
5,Nick Carter you rock my world!!!!,"It's an amazing album!The album blows my mind!!!There are a couple beautiful songs like :Do I have to cry for you,Heart whitout a home and Who needs the world.And off course the rocksongs like:I stand for you,girls in the U.S.A and blow your mind.The best album ever!ithink everybody has to buy the album Now or never!Nick you did your best and it went great!Whit love Karlien Ritterp.s:I am listening too the album right now,becouse it'sNow or Never!!!"
5,The Talented Nick Carter,"I think this album really shows just how talented Nick really is. All BSB fans already knew he was extremely talendted. This album has ballads accentuated by Nick's sexy voice, and also has song really good up tempo rock songs. This CD is a permanent fixture in my CD player. I hope if your were considering buying this CD you do. If you at least give it a listen you will have to buy it."
5,Nicks Sound Rocks!,"Nick's Solo debut cd is off the hook! The cd has everything for everyone. Some pop, some rock, some hip hop. It has songs for every mood! I think he did a wonderful job on his first solo cd and I can't wait to see him perform and hopefully another album. I give it 5 Stars!"
4,Great solo debut!,"I was impressed by Nick's solo debut. It is well written, well produced and the he is most definitly moving towards a different sound. Nick Carter's vocals on the CD are amazing, however, at times, his voice does not seem to be a fit for the rock-driven songs. Overall, the CD is most definitly a successful debut."
5,"See beyond the pop image, this is history in the making","As an adult I've come to appreciate all genres of music and realize what GOOD music truly is. When I opened up this album this afternoon, I wasn't sure what to expect. But as I started listening to the tracks, I couldn't help but think about the person behind the songs. This is an impressive compilation of songs. It ranges from the essential 80's punk rock sound to the more familiar pop ballads and ditties. I think many an avid music fan will appreciate this album on many levels. 5 stars, this album is incredible. Definitely worth your time and money!"
5,AMAZING !,"now that I got that amazing CD let me tell what I think about it.I think it's a really fantastic album. His voice has grown up. And if you read the lyrics you really know what he's feeling.There's so much power in the up-tempo songs in his voice. And a lot of feeling in the ballads. And I guess the song "" help me "" shows what's going on with young men.....So all of this I really love that album and the limited edition is fantastic. I'm very happy to got one.I hope we will get another solo album of Nick Carter. So go on...."
2,Disappointing Album,"I was incredibly disappointed with Nick Carter's Now or Never. After hearing ""Help Me"", I was sure the whole thing would be brilliant. Especially with Max Martin being in on some of the music. But nope. I bought the album without previewing and it [is bad]. Justin Timberlake had praised Nick saying, ""The world needs another Bryan Adams."" Okay, this is nothing like Bryan Adams. I was expecting heart felt, rock driven love ballads. There is only one like that: Do I Have to Cry for You. The rest is all loud guitar, voice shouting garbage. Nick, please have your head examined before you record anything else. Or go back to the Backstreet Boys. Ya know, stick to what you're good at."
5,Nick's Album is a Success,"In Nick Carter's album, Now or Never, a range of emothions are shown, from lust to freedom to pure love. In each song Nick puts so much emotion and soul into it. The beats are catchy and the ballads will tear at your heart. Good going Nick. This album is for anyone who appreciates heartfelt music."
5,Just Nick Carter? - Just Fantastic!!!,"Forget Backstreet boys, forget Aaron Carter's brother - this is neither of these. It's just Nick Carter and it's brilliant! Now or Never is a fabulous showcase of Nick's wonderful talents. It's not Backstreet Boys - with this album Nick has shown that he can sing something other than full blown pop songs and has revealed a gorgeous guitar rock style that fits his voice perfectly. Who knows if Nick is going to record with the Backstreet Boys ever again but if there is more like this on the way from his solo exploits then frankly I don't care!!"
5,This album is awesome!,"This album is simply amazing! Nick Carter at his best. I think that the best song on the album is ""Blow Your Mind"", it sounds soo awesome!"
5,Different and Refreshing,"This is a side of Nick Carter, formally of the Backstreet Boys, that changes what I first thought of him. The album is total 180 from his original pop status. And now he wants to be a ROCK star. He does have the voice for it. Even though he still has the soft ballads like ""Do I Have to Cry For You"" and a up-beat tune ""Help Me"", no one can blame him. Songs like that helped launch his singing career. The album really does make you think of him as an adult. If Nick Carter keeps this up, he just might get a new following. I say this album is a A minus."
5,Real Singer,I think all Justin Timberlake fans must listen this album.. so maybe they can learn what a REAL SINGER means
5,DOYLE RULES!,"Arthur Conan Doyle is my favorite author and the 4 Star Trek series are my favorite television shows, so you can imagine my excitement when they combined the two in the Alien Voices version of The Lost World. I have seen several movies of the Lost World, but none were as interestingly dramatized as the Alien Voices one. Although it is a fine triumph, I highly reccomend the book which is awesome! Also I highly recommend other Doyle sci-fi classics like ""The Posion Belt"", ""Maracot Deep"" and ""Tales of Terror and Mystery."" Who knows, maybe Doyle will reach the fame that Jane Austen recently acquired. He sure deserves it!!!"
5,Sweet Jesus.,"This album gives life meaning. After really getting to take in the full effect of this music, I don't have a doubt in my mind that Streetlight Manifesto is solely responsible for the creation of mankind and the universe as a whole."
2,i like the part that goes na naa na naa,this album is the same song over and over . the first couple times i liked it then the bottom fell out.what a lousy singer who probly thinks he is so prolific or profound please.its sounds like a local ska band from the 90s.nothing new for a ska band entering a new millenium. the only good song is a moment of violence . heres to life is a good attempt at a song but turns sour .the band didn t have the chops to play a song orginized like that.the saddest song is the gayest song and any band who use excessive amounts na na na 's in a song you just know the band is cheap talentless tacky and poppy
4,Great Camera,"I hope to write more later. I just recently purchased this camera after researching for several months. We were on a tight budget, so cost was important. I absolutely love the camera -- other reviewers downgraded due to noise levels at higher ISO settings. I rarely use those settings anyway. However, I was a medical photographer for a number of years, also a newspaper photographer and worked in hospital public relations. Have taken thousands of photos of all different kinds. The camera takes some time to get to know, but like any tool, once you know how to work your system, you can get amazing results. In other words, if you know what you are doing, you can get this camera to do just about anything with remarkable results. I would highly recommend it for the money."
4,Not a bad effort.,"I never saw the show, but this CD is basically cover versions of old songs. I found it lacking emotionally, however, especially on the song ""Eye on the Sparrow"". I have only ever heard that song one other time on the movie soundtrack for Sister Act 2 and to be frank it is impossible to compare the two. The Sister Act 2 version (featuring Lauryn Hill and someone else I forget their name) was extremely emotional and very effective and I loved it. This version tho sounds much more like some cheesey cover a pop group such as S Club 7 might do (no offence to S Club 7 fans). It really is awful and I felt really dissapointed in that respect.However there are some very good tracks on the album most notably ""Promise of the Future"" is a really nice ballad and ""Lead Us On"" will get you bopping along to your stereo. There are only about 3 songs on this CD that I found dissapointing. I recommend this CD because there are some gems in the line-up even if a couple do get your goat!"
4,Taking responsibility,"The more we read of Osho's thoughts, hopefully, the more we are able to take on board what he is trying to tell us. As he says, it all comes down to self-knowledge. The more we understand ourselves and therefore let go of our baggage the more joy we find in our lives and the more we are able to realize that responsibility is the act of self-realization. Sounds so easy! It is, except our egos get in the way and fear takes hold. But the more we grow in consciousness the easier it is to let go of what has held us back. Worth pursuing!Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
3,Another good one by Osho,"You have to have a certain mindset to be able to read a book by Osho, but if you do this book won't disappoint you at all. I own a lot of Osho's works and this one is on par with several of his others. Definitely not a book that a ""first time reader"" of Osho should pick up, but indeed a nice addition to an existing collection."
4,2 for the price of one,These are both pretty good movies with a slight connection of having Tommy Lee Jones and his US Marshal crew being the hunters. The plots are well done with just enough twists to keep your interest. The acting is solid in both but I actually liked Wesley Snipes better than Harrison Fords version. Robert Downey is solid in US Marshals and makes it better because of his acting. Tommy Lee is his usual scene chewing character but always fun to watch. As a 2 film set this is a real bargain.
5,Awesome Movie,If you love action movie's then these 2 movies are great to watch has a family. I would recommend to anybody
4,"""Good Action Thrillers!""",Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones star in the 1993 filmbased on the tv series. A doctor is on the run after he'sfalsely accused of murdering his wife. Wesley Snipes starswith Tommy Lee Jones in the 1998 sequel. A U.S. Marshalhunts another man falsely accused of murder. These aregood films and it's great to have them together. Theyboth have good picture and sound plus a couple neatextras. I recommend this double feature set.
5,good book for toddlers,"My 18 month old daughter loves this book. I think she is attracted to the bold illustrations and she's very interested in trucks. It has a short sentence on each page. (""Here come the trucks"" ""They go over the bridge"" ""Here is a truck working all night long"") She reads it several times a day and asks me to read it to her sometimes as well."
3,Primal Instinct,The book was intersting but the female doctor ( FBI M.E.)was not believable when both of the FBI agents were confronting the chief. Trying to pull her gun and talking like she did to the chief did not strike me as being inteligent or productive.
4,Good read.,"I see that other people are giving this book a bad review because of Hawaiian history, etc. None of that bothered me and I am sure it is because I really don't know much about Hawaii's history.My only complaint about this book (as with the others in the series) is that Jessica always compares the lead investigator with her first lover (I swear in almost every book). I know that this shouldn't bother me but I just don't care. I also just am not that crazy about her as a person. I guess I am just tired of hearing that she is the most gorgeous & smartest person alive. I also get tired of hearing references to her past cases.Barring the things I don't like about her the stories themselves are really good. I almost wish this wasn't a series though because of what I mentioned above. I LOVE series books but when you just don't care for the main character I just can't give it a 5 star rating.At any rate, if you don't read these all at one time the books themselves are good."
5,"Yes, FIVE stars and then some.",I read WINTER WHEAT probably a dozen years ago and have dipped into a couple times since. It's one of those habit-forming kinda books that you want to tell everyone about. Ellen Borden is a character you'll admire and remember. Think Willa Cather in Montana and you'll be close to what kind of a writer Mildred Walker is. Highly recommended.
2,Montana flat and wide,"Mildred Walker lived in Great Falls Montana from 1933-1955, I lived there 1960-1965. She describes the flat, haunting, lonely,isolation you feel there even a decade later the wheat fields as it existed then and probably does today. The colors that vary in the landscape that changes from season to season and even time of day she does not capture as fully as my family and I did, but then one of my daughters is a painter and sees things like an artiest that see then gets you to see. There is repetition which some may not like but this is needed to grasp way life is lived on the high plains of Montana. The land of "" Big Sky where there is no door"""
4,Decent Read,"I enjoyed the persistant pace of the writing, though this isn't a page turner/stay up all night type book.The main character seems so innocent and sheltered at first, but grows her emotions as the story proceeds. Winter Wheat was written in 1944 and is set in about 1941, I think. It's enjoyable to see how a 1940's author writes on ageless human topics tactfully and compare how a similar topic would be presented today.On another note, being involved in wheat production on the high plains, it was touching to see how some things stay the same (weather & chaff in my sandwich) and how farming differs today.The ending didn't jazz me up much, but then this is a literary novel I suppose and quite short on vampires, zombies & princesses. But it's worth a read on a below zero night. Or while waiting at the elevator in the heat swatting flies."
4,lyric translation sucks,"I haven't purchased this particular ethiopiques, but i do own the 16th, and 7th (Asnaqach and Mahmood). The collections of songs are great. However, the lyric translations in English are very inaccurate. It has the artist intro and lyrics in English and French. The translations in English are very short also, they only cover the first 1/3 of the song, which doesn't make any sense b/c if you are going to offer the lyrics, then translate them all the way through and precisely. If you don't know Amharic, and you are eager to know what the singers are singing about, do not refer to CD's coverlet book."
4,"Overall, A Good Book","I thought that overall this was a good book. It covered many different areas of programming under Linux, which was great. Covering HTML, Perl, CGI, BASH, GTK+, TK, TCL, etc...My only complaint (hence the 1 star deduction) is the fact that if you *really* want to get into some of these topics (ie. GTK+), you would have to buy another book dedicated just to that. Sometimes I thought the explainations were not as thourough as I would have liked...but, overall a good book for people learning to program many different languages under Linux."
3,"Very useful book, marred by some incompleteness","The book is very good. It has a lot of useful information on the LINUX programming environment.The discussion of make though is oriented towards UNIX generic make, not GNU make. GNU make has more powerful rules that the book does not discuss.In general, given the choice, the book concentrates on common subsets that will be valid on all UNIXen and with most UNIX tools rather than the specifics of LINUX.On the other hand this is a great book which fills a keenly needed niche."
4,Great book compared to similiar books on the subject,"This is a big book that covers a lot of topics relating to Linux. If you're looking for a introductory book or a somewhat intermediate book that will help you get a jump on Linux programming then this is probably the best one released for this operating system so far. Although you'll find many typos and misaligned text in this book, as well as some dated code and libraries, it still does provide a lot of useful examples into how Linux programs are written and created. Most of the things covered in this book are done rather quickly so it is not a complete reference manual at all and it doesn't aim to be. It is more or less just a large book on many key Linux subjects and you will not be wasting your time picking up a copy of this book. Hopefully we'll see more books like this one released for this operating system."
3,Not for beginners...,"Hi, I bought this book because my unix programming class requires it. Everyone I know told me it's an awesome book to buy so I bought it. I suppose it's a good book like everyone said except you have to watch out if you are below intermediate level programmer. It's a good reference book to programmers who are intermediate to expert but definitely not for beginning C programmers. Every thing is short to the point and the book will not pamper you through. If you think you have good knowledge, go for it!"
4,An excellent starting point,"This is a good book for those that want to get down to programming in Linux. Its a good choice for the sysadmin that wants to learn shell scripting, perl, and some C."
5,Truly a must have .....,"This Wrox book truly rocks! A proper introduction to Linux,Unix, *ix, etc... The concepts presented by the authors are clear and directly relative to anyone pursuing mastery of a ""Unix-style"" computing environment. For me this book provided a bridge between mearly tinkering with Linux and actually understanding some core concepts in the Linux/Unix underbelly. Highly recommend!"
3,UNIX and not Linux,"Overall, this book is okay for beginners. I have a problem with the section that covers processes/threads. Their discussion talks about UNIX details and not Linux details and completely skims over the Linux threading model. The cover of the book say ""Linux"" not UNIX guys."
2,Not worth it,"As a true beginner, I had a lot of trouble understanding the concepts in the book. It did not give nearly as many examples as were necessary nor was the presentation beginner friendly. I wouldn't recommend this book... unfortunately, I don't know of a good alternative."
2,IM having a MS flashback....,As simple as I can put it this book reminds me of something that would have MS slapped across the front... iow If you have a couple of years to sift through a book and find the valuable information then this book is for you.... I wont totally put down this book after all it helps keep my door open....
3,good book - could be great,"This book will bring you up to speed on the Linux API. My only complaint is that it skims the surfaces. Take out the sections on Tcl, HTML, Perl, and CGI; they are so basic that they are useless anyway, and they don't fit in here. ""Beginning Linux Programming"" has the potential be the master of all of the Linux books if they would cut out these non-Linux topics and replace them with more Linux information.For example, I loved the compiler section but it stopped short on shared libraries to save room for Perl and CGI later in the book. If the authors are listening: the cover of the book says Linux programming, not web programming.As for the presentation of the book: Great examples, great explainations, and very clear."
4,Enough to get you going,"This book was excellent for its intentions. It provided the basic information needed to get up and programming quickly, without all the unnecessary details. It gives you enough information to get the job done without having to wade through all the fluff."
2,not a good linux book,"This is a book talks many things, but do not let you have a whole picture or what is the uniques of Linux."
2,Disappointing second album,"I'd like to second some of the other reviewers' reviews of this album. It really lacks the energy and the coherence of the previous album. The tracks in general are a little slower. The production quality is overall about the same, but it is just not as ""listenable"" as Believe was. The exception I find on the album is the ""Club Mix"" of ""Turn It Around.""But if we think about that for a second, aren't we talking about ""club music"" here afterall? Are we under any pretenses that this is elevator or lobby music? I should think not. What we expect from this band, and from a second album is an equal or better effort at club music. House-ish, trance-ish, and anthemic. It's just missing on Turn it Around.I wholeheartedly recommend Believe, but I'd steer clear of this one unless you find it used."
3,I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED,"First of all, yes this album is not all great. Second yes, the album does not even give you information or the lyrics of the song, and third VANESSA is LEAVING 4 strings! yup you read right, this is very sad and I think that once Vanessa leaves, the 4 strings will be gone for good. TO bad though because they were doing good!"
3,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Wow, I don't know what to begin with,i'll just put it this way, this would have been a better album that the first one if lead singer Vanessa Van Hermert was doing the whole voucals on this album, it's almost as if she dosen't excist in this album, and i have no idea who is that other female doing voucals and it's not really the same without Vanessa, it's like Iron Maiden without Bruce Dickinson although 2 diffrent types of music, and as far as i know that this band will be having a new singer and once this take place it won't be the same 4 strings i once liked due to the amazing voice of this young lady, music is excellent but you can scence that something is missing , i hope these guys realize it, this lovely sound if Vanessa is the key."
2,I want to like this album...,"I quite liked 4 Strings first album, and had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver much for me. If I had to put my finger on it, I'd say the band was trying too hard this time to play it safe. A couple of the tracks drift well into pop, and very soft pop at that. Two of the tracks start brilliantly, only to lumber along with minimal development, or worse, be destroyed by lyrics (""when dolphins cry""? yikes...). I think this album will likely produce several terrific singles (""Turn It Around"" is the album's high point), but otherwise, it's a pass for me..."
2,Sophmore slump,"4 String's first album ""Believe"" has many great moments - well worth the purchase. I have to agree with the other 2 reviews though that this album is rather disappointing. To point out a few worthwhile listens here: ""Until You Love Me"" recalls the great feel of ""Believe"", and the single ""Turn it Around"" is good as well. ""Free"" is also not bad... You can find ""Turn it Around"" on collections by Ultra, so I'd recommend buying those before you purchase this album."
3,4strings on the go ..wow !!,Well this realease was a disappointment to me and 4 strings fans all around the Globe.the cd starts with some very similiar melodies from the previous album and there was no new melodies from the singer.It was too sound focused that the singer's voice wasnt appreciated at all .If you campare this with ian van dahl's lost and found you would agree with me that ian van dahl's edition was defintely a better choice compared to this edition .It was a disappontment to me and hop 4 strings works hard to bounce back ..!
2,"Vanessa is rarely to be found, save your money.....","Vanessa is not found often in this album.The album has a few good select tracks such as the lead singles ""Turn It Around"" & ""Back To Basics."" Other great songs are ""Free"" featuring Sphere, ""All Around The World"", ""Until You Love Me"" and ""Living A Lie."" Other than those songs, the rest are cheesy dance tracks that sound as if they were written, arranged and put together in 10 minutes. I was also displeased with the lack of Vanessa's vocals which shine from beginning to end on their debut ""Believe"", so where is she now?the vocalists on this album excluding Vanessa are off key and flat at times. They hardly are worth the listen and just sound like back up singers, or really bad demo singers.I say unless you're a diehard fan and must absolutely have this, just save your money."
4,Excellent.,"Dorianne Laux, Smoke (BOA Editions, 2000)My last encounter with Dorianne Laux was almost twenty years ago, in an anthology called Three West Coast Women (Five Fingers Press, 1987). I picked it up in college, and decided after reading it that I wanted to check out more work by Dorianne Laux. Why it took me close to two decades I've no idea, but I finally have.Smoke is a very, very good book. Laux is one of those poets who uses understatement, and uses it well, preferring to let the poem do the talking:""When I arrive at the tollgate I have to makemyself stop thinking as I dig in my pocketsfor the last of my coins, turn to the attendant,indifferent in his blue smock, his white haircurling like smoke around his weathered neck,and say, Thank you, like an idiot, and driveinto the blinding midday light.""(--""Abschied Symphony"")This is definitely one to check out. ****"
5,Elegance,"These choice of songs features Diana Ross' divesity as a singer. It takes us from the 60's to the 90's as her style changes; a little bit of pop, rock, R&B; even easy listening. Diana Ross is still definately the Boss."
2,"Where is: The Boss, Missing You, It's My Turn?","Ultimate? Not at all. EMI should sack its compiler and let the fans decide what should be on a Diana Ross compilation. Valuable space is wasted on this disc because of the daft decision to put Supreme songs, and a number of fillers that I have never heard. Where is the beautiful ""Missing You"" from 1984, or ""The Boss"" from 1979? And of course ""It's my Turn"" and the very obvious ommission of ""I'm Coming Out"". OK, I am on a roll now ... where is ""Last Time I Saw Him"" or ""The Wiz"" or the UK and Aussie No. 1 ""My Old Piano"" (from 1980)?I can assure you, even Ms Ross wouldn't be happy with this pitiful effort. After seeing her in concert in Sydney in 1991, I realised how fantastic her treasure trove of songs is. And yes, all the ones I mentioned above were part of her concert ... but not part of this joke of a CD."
3,Casual Fans Only,"Although there is plenty of negative reviews about this album, I'll explain why this album was made. This album is intended ONLY for CASUAL fans of Diana Ross who only wants just one CD. There is no way to satisfy everyone with just one CD just like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones,....Thus, it is NOT for the Diana Ross fan since you would already have these songs. As far as why certain songs are here and others are missing is a mystery. It's best to either get her box set (which may STILL not satisfy the fan) or get other hit collections."
4,One Woman: The Global Smash except in the States,"In 1993-94, Diana's compilation, ""One Woman"" topped the charts across Europe, even becoming her best selling albumin the U.K. certified 4xs platinum plus, and across the continent, in Pan Asian countries, Australia and South America. But in typical Motown quandary fashion, they chose not to release this abridged version of her near Gold box set, ""Forever, Diana"". (To their credit, the boxset did particularly well in the states. But at a near $60 retail, the single disc compilation was designed for the mass consumer). Motown didn't quite get this until late 1993-94. Even choosing not to name it ""One Woman"" as in other territories, it still sold over 250k-300k in spite of itself.A broad retrospective of her entire career, ""One Woman"" remains the definitive snapshot of a glorious career up to its 30th Anniversary."
3,A Good CD,"There are several good songs on here, but some that are downright irritating, especially ""Upside-Down"". But, it's still pretty good."
5,Great alternative to going to a class,"I purchased this to have a full 90 minute yoga session on days when I can't make it to the studio. I was hesitant to try an audio CD instead of a video, but the booklet really does help to ""see"" what the poses should look like. Also, the instruction is clear enough where I didn't have to refer to the booklet for each pose.My only disappointment with the CD is that it's broken up into 2 CDs. The first time I used it, I was annoyed I had to get off the mat to change the CD, but now I get around it by loading it as a playlist on my ipod and using speakers.I'm happy with the product."
5,Aerobed Classic,I recently purchased this item to take with me to a relative's house for a weekend visit. The weekend was filled with lots of hard work and when I laid down on the Aerobed it was extremely comfortable. I love the one touch feature which allows you to fill more air in the mattress making it more firm to sleep on. The pump is attached so you don't have to put it back on to adjust the firmness. Great item. Comes with convenient carrying bag. I would definitely purchase another inflatable mattress from Aerobed if I needed one.
3,Not quite what I wanted; good for stated purposes.,"This isn't at all what I was looking for in a phonology textbook. It's perfect for non-linguistics majors who need to have a basic background in phonology. A warning to linguistics buffs wanting to buy this book: it doesn't touch the more fascinating parts of phonology(the introduction even states that it will not even touch things like Grimm's Law), and no connections to other linguistic fields. I wish that the description had stated that it was designed for non-linguistics majors, because that's obviously where this book is aimed. I really wish I had bought a different textbook."
2,Isn't as advertised,"First of all, there is a lot of dead silence on this CD. At least two tracks go to silence right in the middle of the song.Second, the bass isn't that fat. The sound cuts you hear above are the best parts of the songs. The songs quickly degrade into what can only be described of as noise. This isn't good techno. A few songs seem to copy Enigma, only very badly.I wish I could get my money back. This CD is basically junk."
1,Don't trust everything you read.,"This music has a depth of ""darkness"" that compares well with the movies Star Wars and The Matrix.Also, two of the other reviews I read here are the same (copied and pasted) as the text of a junk promotional email that I got from the band's promoters recommending the album."
2,Nothing Spectacular,"I bought this CD without knowing how it sounded cause I love techno and assumed this ""Dark Techno"" will be different. I was sadly mistaken. From now on I will preview cd's before buying them. Well now I cant cause they took out Napster. The guy who said that this album sounds like Enigma and Deep Forest is mostly correct. Except that Enigma and Deep Forest sound better cause they have more concentrated beats. The 1st two tracks sound like something from the game ""Wipeout"". After that it just get's repetitive and boring. Also, in one of later tracks there is a long silence in the middle of the song. The Cd wasnt even manufactured correctly. My advice, steer clear of this one."
1,So bad it's good - a B-movie album!,"Involution is ridiculously bad. Written by two Spanish-speaking dudes who definitely didn't get any help on the grammar side of things, and anyone who buys this at a brick-and-mortar store has no excuse for not knowing what they're getting into. A quote from the back cover: ""One day you realize that god and devil are the same soul playing our lives..."" Not ""the devil"", not ""Devil""... just ""devil"". Exactly.The music is just as hilarious as the lyrics, second only to the photography and artwork as the funniest aspect of the album. The main composer puts himself in poses that harken back to Thriller-era Michael Jackson, and the other dude is in every case shown only in low-resolution shots, placed in random places for no reason I can fathom.I would suggest downloading it, but I can't for the life of me think of who would support such a torrent. Buy it and brighten your day by comparison... most of us do things more musical than this whilst on the toilet!"
3,Probably worth the price...,"A couple of good songs and a couple of lousy songs. I think the promoters sent emails out to lots of mailing lists, but I listened to it objectively, and they might have something worth promoting. This won't be the band's last cd and it won't be their best cd, but I'll listen to it from time to time. It reminds me of Tangerine Dream in some places. I wish the songs had been longer and the they could do without the ear-piercing screech in track 3."
4,"You'll LOVE IT, or you can hate it !!","about MUSIC:strong haunting beats and a deeply felt message about the universal spirit beyond religions,but about LYRICS... if you are planning become a NUN or a PRIEST, DO NOT BUY IT !Good stuff."
5,There's nothing dark enough like the DARK PROJECT,"A great CD to hear very loud, this is a real cracker. From the addictive sounds of Music:Response and the pumping rhythm of the ""Sphere of Yearning"" song to the malevolent beat of ""Dark Atmosphere"" I think this ""Involution"" album is first class.Like I told u before, there is nothing dark enough like the DARK PROJECT !Awsome Lyrics"
5,Real new stuff people !,"Real new stuff people !check out the debut album INVOLUTION guys !They have created this new music style called DARK TECHNO !Dark Project assemble haunting beats, electronic washes of texture sound, and otherwordly vocals to convey the angst, emotion, and a deeply felt message about the universal spirit beyond divisions and religions.Step inside the Dark Project, feel the groove, find your soul ...This is real new stuff !Bye from UK !"
2,Bad,I didn't like these movies at all.The special effects are bad.Will give it 2 stars because off Greg Evigan.He is the highlite off these movies even though he wasn't in them as much as I hoped.
1,Breaks easily and very expensive,"I have 2 Braun shavers, in both the foil broke very quickly.When I saw the price of the replacement foil I decided to buy a new shaver. I found a Philips/Norelco for $30.If you need a new foil, do yourself a favor and look for a new shaver of a different brand. Rotary blades seem to be more durable than vibrating ones."
4,Why are you reading a review of a replacement blade???,Silly to read this. It makes your shaver good as new. You either like it or you dont.
4,What a great blend!,The cd's claboration of artists is fantastic! Our favorite is the Shawn Jones Band. We will be looking forward to another release from this artist! This cd opened us up to hear a wonderful new voice. Shawn Jones were waiting for more!
1,COMPLETE waste of money,"I can't remember the last time I've seen such unbelievabley amateurish dancing... oh wait - last student halfa I had the misfortune to attend. I'll grant you the scholarship behind the video is good, but franky I was stunned by the lack of talent displayed. I've seen Artemis in person - she's a wonderful, vibrant, talented dancer... but not in this video. And she was the best of the dancers. The other dancers were not very inspiring. I saw very little life in their dancing or their facial expressions. Their dances may have been historically and technically accurate, but they lacked the spark and vibrancy that I expect to see in a Middle Eastern Dancer. Frankly, I've seen better drum solos performed by advanced students. Save your money... skip this video. I gave it one star because of the scholarship - it had NOTHING to do with the dancing."
2,"Dry lists of configurations settings, a lot of errors.","I bought this book based on the great reviews here at Amazon. I don't have a clue why reviewers here thought it was so good. I should have known better and bought the O'Reilly book to start.Most of the text consists of dry run throughs of various configuration settings - much of which probably came right from the online Apache manual. There were many errors. And, contrary to reviewers who claimed the author was open for questions, when I sent email asking about possible errata, the email was returned with an invalid address. The author's web site is also gone.I also was unhappy that there was next to nothing about Java servlets and Apache.The O'Reilly book got so-so reviews, but I can't imagine how it can be worse than this one."
2,Not good; assumes too much,This book jumps around from trying to teach novice stuff to assuming the reader is about as tech saavy as the author. He might be tech saavy but he is not a good teacher. I am still trying to find a good Apache guide. Maybe best to just bug my friends.
3,Neither a rant nor a rave...,"This title surpasses the O'Reilly offering, that's for sure. But then again that doesn't really say much. This book is fairly decent, but needs more polish before it's worth the raves expressed in other reviews. I find myself hitting apache.org a lot"
2,Very mixed,"Some good, some bad. Unfortunatly the mod_perl section (the main reason I bought the book) is one of the weakest. On the other hand the explaination of security and SSL is one of the better ones I have read. The book is neither a good referance book, nor a good ""reader"". The cover proudly claims to cover Windows - which would have raised a red flag had I seen it before purchase - but the book only devotes 12 pages to it. The Macintosh version is not mentioned at all."
4,Excellent Fischer Novel,"I won't synopsize, as you can find that anywhere. Tibor has written three excellent novels: Under The Frog, The Thought Gang, and The Collector Colletor. Even if you have been disappointed by his other works, do not write him off until you have tried one or more of these three. I recommend them in that order. All bitterly funny, all astonishingly original, all deeply memorable, all vastly superior to his more recent efforts."
3,"It's Only Rock & Roll, But I Like It","This book is funny and smart. As others have noted, it isn't War & Peace, or Ulysses, either. More like a very adult, edgy comic book. However, this male-written female perspective on males and other females really rings true (or else the women I work with and to whom I am often invisible have been putting me on all these years). This turned out to be the most fascinating aspect of the book, and I think it is no small achievement."
2,"A good start, but slow finish","This romance started out with an intersting story, setting and heroine. Somehow it fizzled out in the end with a little too much moralizing. It was fairly sensous, but it just could not hold my attention through the end."
5,Drop everything and read this,"A super book. I had no idea how I was going to learn to love this hero, but Dylan Kennedy won my heart and soul 4ever! Kathleen wanted to be Cinderella, but he taught her to be herself! The love scenes in the fancy railroad car were the Best! The big scam they pulled had me on the edge of my seat. The last scene of the book had me laughing through my tears. This is Romance at it's very best. Reminds me of all that is good and bright about people."
3,The mistress by Susan wiggs,The mistress was an enjoyable and easy reading book..I would recommend it to my Friends. I will read moreOf her books.
4,The sweetest ending........,"I thought this book was average at best until the last three chapters. I love a sweet and satisfying ending, and this one has that, and more!The Hostage and now The Mistress read more like fiction than romance novels, but there is just enough romance to keep me, an avid romance fan, interested.The books take place during the Great Chicago fire of 1871, and I have enjoyed reading about this time in our nation's history through these characters eyes.Katherine was the best part of this book. Not entirely good, she ""faked"" her position in the beginning of the book, but certainly not all bad. She seemed real to me. Wanting more, as we all do, but in the end realizing that what she most wanted, Dylan, had nothing to so with money.Dylan was also likable because he had survived so much. I understood his con ways because of his need to survive. His reformation was the best part of this book.Overall, the ending provided me all I need to recommend this book wholeheartedly!"
5,Susan Wiggs at her very best,"With a backdrop of the Great Chicago Fire, THE MISTRESS features a counterfeit heiress who marries a fraudulent bachelor under false pretenses.Kathleen O'Leary (yes from *that* O'Leary family) has always wanted to be rich -- so under a veil of deception she attends a society function and meets the wealthy man of her dreams who isn't all he pretends to be.Dylan Kennedy is a grifter. Down on his luck, he figures what better way to attain great wealth than to marry an heiress? The lovely Kathleen seems the perfect candidate.Susan Wiggs has written another winner of a story. I can't wait to read the third in this series, Lucy's story, THE FIREBRAND."
4,For BBR Records - read this!,"Dear BBR,I am loving your re-release of The Pointer Sisters' ""So Excited!"" album. If you are considering reissuing Diana Ross' RCA catalogue, here are my suggestions as bonus tracks on a ""Ross"" edition.1. Pieces Of Ice - 7""2. Pieces of Ice - 12""3. Up Front - US 12""4. Up Front - UK 12"" remix5. Up Front - UK 7"" remix6. Sleep With Me Tonight - if this actually exists! Same song cut by Neil Diamond in '82 and by Patti LaBelle in '86"
5,One of the best,"Prior to buying this CD as an effort to complete my Diana Ross collection, I only knew three things about this album; that it had flopped, that it was terrible, that it was forgotten. Well, never believe all the bad hype. I love it. There is hardly a bad track on here. The tunes are all great and upbeat and I don't know why it is so underrated."
3,Good album,"""Ross"" is a pretty good album. Love the cover photo as well. Even though the lyrics don't make sense, I love the 80's synth-pop song Pieces of Ice - I don't know why it didn't chart better since it had the sound that was popular at the time and a erie but fun video to go with it. Up Front is also a great rock song that should have charted better (maybe if they had done a video it would have gotten more attention). Love Will Make It Right is a breezy song that you want to listen to in the spring or summer and will definitely put you in a carefree, good mood."
5,I LOVE THIS PRODUCT,I AM A FAN OF DIANA ROSS AND MY WISH I BEING FORFILLED BY AMAZON I LOST MY COLLECTION IN A FIRE AND THEY ARE HELPING MENOT ONLY TO REPLACE WHAT LOST BUT TO GET ME UP TO DATE ON WHAT DIDN'T HAVE BE FORE I LOVE THEM FOR THAT GREAT WORK.

5,A Serious Book for Serious Athletes-No Kidding,"This is the first book a serious athlete should read on endurance and multisport training. It provides a great foundation for everything you will need to know to develop your own effective training program. The writing team of Sleamaker and Browning work well together. Sleamaker gives you the theory and the facts, and Browning puts them into practice."
3,Works well but not for shaving,"This is advertised for shaving, but my husband says it doesn't do the job as well has shaving cream. We were looking for the after shave (apparently no longer available). My husband uses this as a face wash after he shaves which works similar to an aftershave."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"We received the lotion, and the pump didn't work so we had to purchase another bottle with a pump. My boyfriend said that he didn't really notice a difference in his skin until he mixed the lotion with some shaving soap and incorporated that mixture into his daily shaving regimen; which is what he was already doing with Vaseline intensive care lotion. It really wasn't worth the money for him."
4,Gift,Bought this for a Christmas gift for my nephew and he says he likes it. So I take that it is a good product
1,Ineffective and smelly,"I tried the Jason shaving lotion because I've been looking for an effective, hypoallergenic shaving lotion that doesn't squirt out of an aerosol can. This product smells strongly of chamomile and an incense-like smell. That may be okay for a hand soap, but I don't want that smell on my face. Most shaving creams and even natural hand soaps lubricate better than this product. The lotion doesn't rinse off as easily as most shaving creams or liquid soaps. Almost any hand soap or leave-in hair-and-skin conditioner (such asPaul Mitchell Tea Tree Hair and Body Moisturizer 10.14 Oz) would be a better alternative."
2,Thought this was the after shave!,"My husband LOVES the after shave, not this shaving lotion. I made the mistake of ordering three bottles. My husband gave it a try but did not like it."
1,this is not a book,That's all that needs to be acknowledged this is not a book it is a pamphlet and should be described as one!! Its not a paper back it is literally a pamphlet. Very disappointing. Good info in it but very disappointing....
1,Seriously?,This product was literally a 5 x 6 22 page paper pamphlet. $3.25 for the product. $3.99 for shipping. Can you say total rip off? I can't even believe that someone would have the nerve to do this. OUTRAGEOUS!Detachment: The Art of Letting go While Living with an AlcoholicDetachment: The Art of Letting Go While Living With an Alcoholic
1,Terrible Reprint,"All of the ""books"" sold by this publisher are reprints--which would not be a problem, but for the fact that there are random spacing and spelling errors, the font is miniscule--and that they may (as the pub says) also be missing some text. For the cost, this is unacceptable."
2,Could be a lot better,"It's depressing that these scrapers have gained a near-monopoly in retail stores. Most have small manufacturing defects--little chips or protrusions on the edge--which make it impossible to remove all of the ice or frost in one pass. Although the design has the potential to conform the scraping edge to curved glass, the plastic is too stiff for that to happen effectively.I've had much better luck with brass-blade scrapers. These will not scratch most windshields (though I've experienced significant scratching in cheaply-made windshields)."
3,"not bad, not great","I recently moved from California to Baltimore. I don't have a lot of experience in cold weather, but it didn't take long to know that this is an absolutely necessary tool in these parts. I purchased the Hopkins 16721 Bear Claw 10 inch ice scraper and I've had the chance to use it a few times now. I now know that there are some downfalls to this particular item. First, the handle is too short. I have a truck and it's difficult for me to reach all across the windshield. Next, the ice creeps up the handle and gets on my gloves or hands - so if you're looking at a 10 min. job, good luck... Your hands will freeze. I recommend a longer handle, particularly if you cannot comfortably reach to all parts of your vehicle using it. For small jobs, however, this is a nice tool to have. Perhaps the most effective preparation would be to have two of these - one with a short handle and one with the long handle for times when the snow and ice are thick. Good luck :-)"
3,"Seems like a solid product, but not worth the new price","I ordered 2 of these for the upcoming winter season. My plan was to order 2, determine the quality, then order 3 more if worth the money. For what I paid for the original 2 ($3.78), I felt the price was reasonable. So I went to order 3 more a week later and found that the price had increased to $4.95 each. Since I don't believe these are worth the 30% price increase, I didn't order the other 3. I will get a similar item locally and expect to pay $2.50-$3.99."
2,knock off book,"This book is basically a knock off of Buck Branaman's work. I don't know either trainers, but if you want to work with your horse in a more holistic way, i would go right to tbe source. Buck Branaman."
5,Nice book,"I met him when he was looking lonely (except for the family) at a big-city bookstore signing when the book came out. While I love horses, at the time I hadn't a snowball's chance in hell of ever getting one again. But I bought the book.And I learned about animals that think they are prey--like horses. And to a lesser extent ones that don't. Don't know that he mentions it, but the classic here is a Jack Russell terrier. And how you get to treat them differently. (Oh, that's why the horse I had when I was a teenager.....)And then there's the funny story of the guy who figured he'd gotten his money's worth out of the (probably expensive) workshop when he came home afterwards to find the skunk in his garage. Even though skunks are not prey animals, he was able to move it out of the garage by using Powell's methods."
3,"Good, but way too wordy","Sam Powell has good insights and theories in training horses. However, he repeats things over and over, and wastes way too many words. I almost felt like he was throwing words in there so he could actually create a book instead of an article."
4,Captivating -- I couldn't put it down.,"As an avid student of Asian history and culture, I've read many accounts of the Japanese occupation of Korea. This is the best so far.As I have lived in Korea for 10+ years, I have Korean friends in the same age group as the author, Richard Kim. From the first-hand accounts I have heard from my friends, I believe Lost Names accurately describes conditions for the common Korean citizen during the Occupation period.Through the entire book, I believed I was reading the author's autobiography. I didn't realize that was not the case until I read the Author's Note on the last page. I kept wondering why, since these were his memoirs, the author didn't write in the past tense.For me personally, the book would have been easier to read if it had been written in the past tense. In any case, I highly recommend this book for those who love to learn about the tragic history of the beautiful Land of the Morning Calm."
5,Great Shopping,This item is EXACTLY what I was expecting. The shipping was fast and the entire experience was hassle free! Thanks.
4,Insightful and uplifting,"While reading this book I got the impression that it was a memoir. It is actally not so please be aware of this when reading. Considering that it is fiction the author was surprisingly ""tame"" in telling the story. I was expecting another depressing memoir of a family destroyed by the Japanese occupation. In Kim's book, however, the family's suffering is more subtle and their eventual triump refreshing. It's nice to not read a book where everyone and their mothers die a painful death. This book gave a lot of insight into the lives of Koreans during the occupation. It was also nice to know that not all of the imperial Japanese soldiers were as gruesome as they were in the Rape of Nanjing."
3,Nonfiction bogged down by fiction,"The ""scenes from a Korean boyhood"" in this book, which are evidently based on actual events, are very compelling and convey powerfully what life was like under the Japanese occupation of Korea. So that's the reason to read this book. Unfortunately, these scenes are set in a kind of fiction jello that connects one episode with another by means of impressionistic accounts of the Korean landscape and so on. This sort of writing is much less successful, and you'll find your eyes sliding past some of it. Kim is not as skillful at blending fiction and nonfiction as, say, Dave Eggers, and one wishes the author had related more about the father, who had been imprisoned by the Japanese, or the grandparents, or even the village, which was located in what is now North Korea. However, that would be a different book. Lost Names is not difficult reading and is certainly a good place to begin learning about what Koreans endured during World War II."
3,A nice story though hard to get into,"The story was simple and it was an easy and somewhat captivating read. Though I felt the author could have been a little more emotional, I liked the novel and am glad to have read it. I feel the characters were a little under-developed and the story line jumped around many of times, leaving out things I thought would have increased the connection between reader and character."
1,Not Applicable -- Non Sequitor,"Did I just enter the Twilight Zone? Both previous comments do not match the mp3 download. Has Amazon crossed its links? The item in question is a mp3 download of Beethoven's 3rd and 8th Symphonies performed by the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen conducted by Paavo Jarvi. There are some excellent comments for the CD version of this release in the CD section of Amazon. Read them. Both Bohm and Vansa are excellent conductors, but they don't belong here.I tried to leave the ratings blank indicating neutrality on the release itself, but Amazon won't allow that. So the single star is for the comments, not the performance. (Amazon if you're monitoring this, you should delete all three comments -- including this one -- and link customers to the CD version of this recording.)"
2,another blunder,The author's second book is similar to a travel guides descriptions of far away exotic locales and adventures with the fatal flaw being the author has never been on a greyhound bus past the city limits of his hometown. Writing about police exploits or martial arts persona possessive of physical courage and masculine virtues requires more than being in the vicinity or familiarity with a dictionary and a typewriter. The lady protests too much methinks. A weak book. Don't recommend it.
5,Four years and still going strong!,This is a Professional Grade Machine. I purchased four; one for each member of my family. We have used these machines after every workout 3 times a week for 4 years. The machines have been flawless. The Variable Speed Machine has more power than the Single Speed and is worth the extra expense.
4,Great Massager,"The first thing you think about when you take the Jeanie Rub out of the box is how well constructed it is. It feels like its made of high quality parts, not cheap plastic like most other massagers.The Jeanie Rub performs remarkably well, placing it on a troubled area for a few minutes is all it takes. My only complaint about it is how large the surface area of the massager is. Because of this, you can't really pin point a specific area of the body. You can adjust the intensity as a workaround, but its really not ideal. Overall, very happy with the purchase."
5,Very strong,"The best machine for an excellent massage, really does what the producer says, I enjoy it every time."
5,MASSAGER AMAZING!,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY MASSAGER! WORKS GREAT FOR TIRED FEET, ACHING BACK, SORE HIP, ETC. VERY RELAXING. THIS IS THE SECOND ONE I'VE OWNED. (EX GOT THE 1ST ONE)"
4,A great B sci fi flick,"A few folks here are being overly hard on this movie. I find it to be a wonderful B sci fi flick. Don't worry about the original book, enjoy this movie for what it is, good acting, good plot, nice sets, overall a very strong B flick that I really hope makes it to DVD soon."
5,An extensive package....great mastering of classic Coasters!,"Just got this in and haven't stopped playing it....Its cool because they give you all The Robins' sides first like Smoky Joe's Cafe, and then the next 4 hours are devoted to The Coasters hits like Charley Brown and Searchin.....beware of the bogus bootlegs, this is the real deal from Rhino Handmade. Great packaging and great liner notes and photos.."
3,"It was really short, more appropriate for an anthology,","Considering it was large type and just a little over an hour's read, it wasn't too bad. But let's face it, you can only pack so much action and character development into a story that's only 102 actual pages long. Personally, I was disappointed."
4,the is a very Goooooood Cd and is worth buying,"well all i have to say is that this Cd is really worth buying , not one song on Here soundes poor and as you know it is very very hard to find Cd's that have nothing but good songs on it,but there is only one thing wrong with this CD some songs on it are too short and i get mad because of that some , but it is only like two or three on there like that , the reason i get mad is because i'm a Music person and as soon as i start to get into the songs that are short (Click) they are over, so i just loop the songs lol, but if i could i would get this Cd all over again becasue it is that good"
4,Original but for teenagers,"Sci-Fi, drama, monsters, a strong leading female character, what's not to like?The animation was tight, just not adult enough for me.PROsnew charactersnew worldsmoralssurvivalpositiveCONshypocritical religious leader, so what's new? LOLcattle mindsetThe message this anime sent was to question your leaders, & to not be afraid to set out on your own.You might just save your race.PS It reminded me of a pre-Avatar."
3,Too long...Story line gets lost.,"There were sections that just took too much time and didn't move the story along at a good pace. This could have been edited better.I really liked lots of it...but, was bored by certain parts."
4,The Australian box artwork looks better,The artwork on the front of the dvd case looks too kiddyish. I almost pasted up the opportunity to watch the movie.You should check out auction web sites that have this dvd with its original box artwork. Many foreign countries have the original art on the case which looks a lot better than the American version.The movie itself is very interesting. It's a must have for people who like to read fantasy magazines.
5,Hypnotic and exciting!,"Wal-Mart must have made a mistake on street date because I bought this on August 25th, oh well. I'm a big fan of CGI animation and this one delivers. I mean the textures of some of the characters are unreal it's like you can reach out and feel them. A very cool story and the voice talent was quite good. The only problem I found was some of the animation has slowdown almost like when playing a video game and there is too much going on on the screen. I highly reccomend it if you are a Sci-fi fan who likes animation."
1,Don't buy the Kinde verson,The kindle version of this book is essentially unreadable. A lot of essential formatting is lost; good luck finding Euclid's words among the clutter. Amazon needs to get a better algorithm for converting mathematically-oriented text. The current algorithm is at a 1992 typesetting standard.
1,Kindle version is crap,"Before you decide to waste $.99 on the Kindle version, open up the free sample to see the garbage you're about to get. As for the real book itself, get a paperback or hardcover because it's fascinating, easy and fun to read.It's pretty dumb that they tack on these comments to every version of this book because I'd give it 5 stars for the real thing."
1,Putrid Euclid,"Don't bother downloading this book. Whether read on my PC or on my wife's I-Pad, the text is illegible and the figures distorted. Too bad, since the Heath edition is classic."
1,Unreadable formatting nightmare,"Unreadable. Characters are missing, line formatting is terrible. Not worth the $1, I would have rather bought a candy bar for my money. Don't waste the dollar!"
1,For the kindle,If correct punctuation and Alphebetical congruency are your thing; as well as proper format...such as spacing and paragraphs.....do not buy this book; correction needed for this digital addition.
4,I found this book an inspiration and true-to-life.,"If you are a ""Little House on the Prairie"" fan, this book, based on a true story, is for you. The story follows a Native American woman's life as she survives tragedy and ultimately triumphs. I'm not usually much of a reader, (in fact this was an assignment) but I just couldn't put it down! The author did an excellent job capturing the reality of the Native American way, and depicting the main character's struggle with TB; the isolation, loss of friends and her own illness. This book really makes you appreciate your health and everything you have."
1,BellSouth Caller ID,"So far, after two days of receiving it, it is junk! The display is terrible. It doesn't register any calls...."
3,Hard to read,It works as advertised but the numbers are very difficult to read because they are very narrow and very tall.
4,Good but could be better.,This called ID is large which is good but the numbers are compact making them a little difficult to read.
4,Excellent book about expat life in Asia,"""A MUST READ"" for any guy that has explored the nightlifeof Bangkok. All of C.G. Moore's books about expats living in Asia are entertaining, but this book that centers around the ""HQ"" (old Thermae Coffee Shot) is one of my favorites. In fact, I purchased one of the limited edition copies that he sells on his website. As an old timer to Asia I find his books like Lay's potato chips......you can't have just one."
5,The best book I've ever read,"Before having read this book I never knew what literature can achieve. This marvellous piece of art is a superb combination of - a world class thriller with very affectionate drawings of its characters; - an unmatched illustration of ""the other Bangkok"", presenting a facette of the real face of this amazing city and its nightlife - formerly invisible to all visitors of the realm, who walk on tourist's paths. - and a goldmine filled with pictures which enable us ""falangs"" to understand key elements of the Asian culture.This epos obviously was written with full dedication and unlimited passion, and it revives a four-dimensional picture of one of the most amazing cities of the world. Whoever reads this book with an open heart will most probably fall in love irreversably with ""the land of smiles"" and its myths. Don't miss it."
5,Ex-pat in Thailand's Review,"I'd been in Thailand for a few years when I read Chris Moore's tragic noveland I and almost every fellow ex-pat loved this and most of his books , it wasa way for newbies to understand life on the Pong ,especially the beautiful smiles of the ladies!"
2,not defoe,"This book reads as though it was written by or for Captain Avery himself. It reads like a PR job. It has none of the style or character of Defoe. Some will find it fun but it is no good for a Defoe book.Ironically the excellent American Defoe scholar John Robert Moore attributed the book A General History of the Pyrates to Defoe, but later scholars dismissed this on the grounds that its style did not resemble that of the King of Pirates! The style of A General History of the Pyrates (Volume One at least) seems definitely Defoe's and that is the book to recommend to Defoe fans."
3,Gets you through the game but not perfect,This strategy does help you a lot but it leaves out a lot like battling the side quest monsters (the WEAPONS). You could really use help on these guys!
2,BAD(somewhat),"This strategy guide is very bad for a professional edition. I have found better guides free on the internet. The maps are very nice, but throughout the strategy guide, i found MANY mistakes. i would think that Brady Games would show EVERYTHING in their guide, but they left out a lot. example, there is a hidden 2nd ribbon in the glacial peaks, and master tonberries can be morphed into ribbons. the bestiary is definitely no help at all. but the maps and pictures from the guide are as good as they can get. Info about the monsters is a bit confusing to read too. I would recommend you buying this guide only if you want a minimal amount of info and if your planning to go onto the internet guides to get info for the harder stuff. .............."
4,Not a bad little strategy guide,"I bought this strategy guide when I had about 60 hours put into the game so it wasn't a whole lot of help. It is very valuable when it comes to finding a certain materia, or locating a limit break for a certain character. It also helps with the safe combination in the old mansion, and if I would've got it sooner I would have been able to save the big blue materia from the rocket. As far as tips, like where to go if you want to build up materia it doesn't tell you jack squat. In summary, if you don't feel like printing out a novel on-line, buy the guide, if I had the choice to buy it again or not I would have, only I would of done it sooner."
2,too much time to ship it out,what happen to my product it is taking too muchtime to be ship it I pay the same day and I still waiting for my product to be ship
3,still did not get the balance owed to me from the mispriced book.,was listed as one price and when i got the product it was cheeper. okay but my checking account was not reimbursed the 15.00 difference.
1,rediculusly stupid long ship time,"who ever put this add on the site dosnt under stand next day delivery. when you pay an extra 30 bucks for next day delivery you should get it the next day or the following one after... i ordered this item on the 19th of this month, it is now the 22nd of this month and it says on the ship info that this item will not ship till the 8th of march.... do not buy from this seller unless u contact him and he says it is going out right then and there."
2,IT GAVE AWAY THE WHOLE STORY!!!,Verses' Unofficial strategy is alot better!!(hint hint)It tells you way more info. And it DOESN'T GIVE AWAY THE STORY!!!
4,Depends on what you want.,"Great overall book, but a little stingy on details for the side quests, plus a little false information. For a rookie, this is a great step-by-step guide, but a bad investment for veternans. If you want things like Limit Breaks and gold chocobos, find a web site."
4,Lack of clarity and unhelpful info,"This book was a bit of a challenge. There are some times when it helps and a lot more when it doesn't. I would like to know when the Limits increase, how to learn more Enemy Skills, and about Chocobo breeding. This book doesn't cover these things. It gives you a walkthrough, the plot and some battle tips, but not much else that you can use. (As soon as I figure out how to change the stars, I'm putting it down to a 2-star rating.)"
3,Decent Guide,"The guide has a very good step by step layout to the game. ITs greatest flaw is that it tells the story, I spent many frustrated minutes looking for information and also finding out what happens in the storyline before I saw it. Also the boss strategies are very vague, they dont give a deffinate method to defeat them the yjsut give you an idea on how to beat them."
3,whats with the 1/35 soldiers ?,"I found the book pretty helpfull for the most part.but it doesnt give you all the info you need.like those 1/35 soldiers.I was alwase only able to get 7 of them but no more than that.my friends all tell me that if you get them all you get another character to replace the space that is open from after Aries dies.I wish I could find out , and I will continue looking on the internet for the 1/35 soldiers."
5,Worth every cent,"It cant be any better than this, it has all the info you could ever need. The best strategy for any final fantasy, except for maybe the final fantasy X strategy guide."
3,this one is in my keepers!!!,I collect stratagie guides for every game possible and even games i dont have. my only dissapointment was the guide for raising a good chocobo. I highly recommend this one for anyone that needs help!
3,typical guide,"decent enough, but only get if you suck and want to spoil this wonderful game for yourself (or, like me, buy it after you beat the game a few times and want to reveal any secrets you might've missed before)"
3,Fair.,"This book was super cool but it's certainly not perfect. Its display is rather plain and boring compared to other guides and the materia, armor, etc. was hard to read. Also, the enemy skills were all the way at the back where you couldn't see them. Worst of all, it gave away the BEST PART of it all ... the PLOT!!!!! I recommend the Versus if you looking for the complete package... good strategy though."
5,"An excellent guide, very few, if any, faults.","Tha guide was great! I especially liked the secrets portion of the book. They covered everything from the Chocobos to Materia Locations. The only bad part, if you can even call it bad, was that it didn't give a recomended level for the current and up-coming missions. This also left me guessing whenever I encountered a boss. But overall the guide was great."
3,THIS BOOK DOES NOT HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION,"After finishing the game, I bought the book so I could go back and do some things that I may have missed. I found, however, that the strategy guide is severely lacking in a lot of the game's secrets, one being the character Zack. This is the most important thing that is not covered. It sounds like a rumor, but it's not. There is a way to ""heal"" Zack (the man in the pipe) but the strategy guide makes absolutely not mention of it. It tells you that you can't do anything with the 1/35 soldiers and the Murasame Blade but you can. I think this is really fishy. Maybe squaresoft is hiding something. Hmmm. Let me know."
3,this is an okay guide,"this guide had great maps but it was lacking in some areas...it would tell you to do this and that but when you go to the back of the book and read the side area section you find out you missed a very important item and that you can't go back and get it...the beastery was incomplete, it would tell you that you could not manipulate, morph or steal from something when you could... the guide did not even mention that every monster in the crashed gelinka could be morphed into a source of some kind... the accessory and materia lists where incomplete too they would tell you one place where the materia or item was located and make you think you missed it when you can get it some other way that it does not tell you. the only reason I gave it 3 stars was because of the maps and that the walk through can get you can get you through the game with the bare essetials..."
1,Atrocity. No other word will suffice.,"I bought this guide back when the game was new, so there may have been revisions since then. However, the guide currently decaying in a box in my basement deserves its fate and then some. Filled with inaccuracies, anyone who accomplishes anything using this guide must have some sort of guardian angel, either that or they're an idiot savant. With such strong feelings, I'm afraid I only remember a few specific examples: the entire bestiary seemed to have been formed by hitting the keyboard until they met their quota, and yet it remains incomplete; monsters with the wrong pictures, or no picture at all; misnamed materia listed with a multitude of inaccurate information. There are many more things that are wrong with this guide, but just writing about this thing is making me mad, so I think I'll stop."
1,the worst guide book i ever bought,"i own several guidebooks, most of them being FF guidebooks. This one is by far the worst i ever bought. the text is full of typos and grammar errors and much of the information is confusing because it is inaccurate. I had already beat FF7 several times and then i bought this guide to see if it would tell me anything more. Nope! It sucks. I tried to beat it following the guide and i was actually confused! And i'd already beat the game! That says something awful. The only thing that was even useful were the maps and the bestiary. I definitely would not reccommend spending money on this item."
5,"great product, reliable shipping",This product helps a lot to ensure that you can get everything possible out of your game.
4,Room for improvement,"I've played this game many times. The guide has always been just that, a guide. There are several misspellings, diagrams can become unclear and confusing, and there are many items that should be included that are not. It's been helpful in allowing me to fully complete the game. I would recommend it to anyone needed a helping hand."
3,Nice But...,"Overall the guide has everything an new or even partially expirenced player will need to get through the game. The boss guides are excellent and the basic walkthrough gets you where you need to go, and explains of Materias Uses, so whats wrong with it?Vets, after paying attention to the gameplay and the guide will realize some things wrong with it quite quickly. for example, the guide explains how youll encounter Master Tonberries with 8,000 hp, when they have 44,444. The book has no infomation on Movers (Red Balls) which are a useful gil collecters (30.000 each) + ap gainers. They can be found where the Magic Pots are. It dosent even have a ""enemie skill"" list. It also explains nothing about morphing master tonnberries (ribbon) Unknowns (sources) Cactuars (Tetra Elemental)As you see the guide has many flaws, but is still a nice explanation of getting through the game, i honestly dont recommand it if you've past this great title before thoughLaterz"
4,Final Fantasy Review,"Well simply put, this strategy guide is just that, a guide. sometimes like others have said, it is grammatically incorrect, but we are all humans. for the most part, the guide offers coherent instructions and suggestions on everything in the game. the walkthrough is comprehensive and i have played this game more times than any one person can count, and the only item beside me when i played each time was the guide. most of the time, i didnt really need it after playing so many times, but even i would forget some things. this strategy guide is a must have for anyone who is struggling or justs wants a helping hand. if you are a smart gammer, this is the item you want."
4,"It's Good, with some problems","This book does tell you almost everything in the game. The bad about this is that it givesaway the storyline. It is missing a few weapons and some other things, but you can do fine without them. It has a very compleate section on the monsters, and another good section on the materea. It is good allaround, but its major drawback is that it gives away the story (which I said earlier)."
3,Not the best FF7 book out there,"This is a decent guide to Final Fantasy 7, but it misses quite a lot. In a game as big as FF7, there is a lot to potentially miss. This book also spoils a lot of the game with the pictures. If you want a book that doesn't spoil the game, and picks up a lot of what this one missed, hunt down the guide from Versus Books. That guide has things like the enemy skills, which are barely mentioned in the 'official' book."
2,Not a bad guide except....,"This FF7 strategy guide is good, but there is one HUGE problem with it. IT SPOILS THE GAME FOR YOU!! It shows in detail one of the best parts in the game(the end of disc 1), along with more minor parts of the storyline. which I really hate to see happen because FF7 is such a great gameeee with a incredible story line. It will help you play the game, but I highly recommend not buying this guide"
1,From MASTER to all of you,"DONT BUY THIS ONE. If you read this guide the game will become boring. Every game become boring if you hav his strategy guide. The main idea from this game is to kill Sephirot by yourself, but if you have the guide the game will become so easy that you will finish it in only 40 hours(usual hours of game play 70-199 hours). If you like your money dont buy this book. Take my advice: USE THAT MONEY IN OTHER THINGS LIKE GOING TO THE CINEMA. THIS BOOK SUCKS"
2,Did not like it,"The game was decidly one of the easist FF series games with not much too cover, therefore the strategy guide went over the few quasi-challenging parts of the game. Thumbs down,"
1,THIS BOOK CAN MESS UP YOUR FFVII EXPERIENCE BADLY,"BE WARNED! This Guidebook contains a MONUMENTAL amount of errors. Do not expect to obtain all of the goodies in the game using this book. This book is merely a recitation of the sequence of events in the game. I do not recommend this book unless all you care about is beating the game. This book WILL NOT, I repeat, WILL NOT help you get the games coolest items like the Sneak Attack Materia, Sprint Shoes, Superball, Flayer, and MANY others that the author so conveniently omited. Nearly every other item in this book is mispelled, incorrectly described, or completely erroneous. The only positive thing about the book are the maps, however the items are not all properly labeled for easy reference. I would only use this guidebook for maps, use gamefaqs.com for ALL other information. Since the maps are the ONLY good thing about this guide I give it a 1star/ 5."
1,No Good At ALL,"This is one of the worst game guides I have read in my life...and I've read a few. I got it back in '97 when the game first came out and spoiled everything (even THE big event at the end of the first disc). I later got the guide from Versus Books and it blew this pathetic book out of the water. It spoiled nothing and had twice the amount of useful secrets (including materia combos). Don't waste your time (and money) with this joke. Thankfully, BRADYGames realized its idiocy, fixed it, and got it right for FFVIII's guide (which basically aped FFVII's Versus Books' guide's style). Then they ruined it again with that awful, useless FFIX guide. I guess money grubbers never learn. And guys, you're supposed to be reviewing the GUIDE, not the game..."
3,Indulge and Be Wary,"The BradyGAMES Official FF7 Guide can help you out in a tight spot, with its detailed area maps and instructions. It offers coverage on the game's secrets, sidequests, skills, gameplay, and spells.However, the guide is hampered by several key flaws, including misinformation(Final Attack materia through chocobo races?) grammar errors(Ranch summon materia?) and major plot spoilers (You know who does you know what to you know who at the end of Disc 1?). Read the guide if you're lost, but PLEASE don't turn to pages 124-125 until you pass Disc 1 (MAJOR PLOT SPOILER).Good luck with your reading!"
2,cannot compare with other strategy guides,"I've gone through each FF game with the companion strategy guide. This one is by far the worst strategy guide. Simply too many errors, too many mislabeling of entrance/exit and items in each area, missing labels, wrong information, etc. Language is also at times unclear, as if the author was only writing with Middle school level English. It is adequate to help you get through the game easily, but not worth the price. You might as well look for the online FAQ."
2,Slight deviation from description provided,"The description said I was to receive the Playstation version of the strategy guide. I received the PC version instead. While the versions may be identical or only vary slightly (i am still unsure), the description should have stated that it was the PC version. The transaction otherwise went very smoothly and I would transact with this sellet again."
4,Final Fantasy 7 Guide for Playstation,A lovely book for FF7 fans. Each step in the story is explained and sidequests explored. Methods for gaining each character are included in both the main walkthrough and sidequest section for easy use.
3,This Book Must Have Been Put Together In 10 Or 15 Minutes!!!,"This book was all messed up.Monster stats all wrong,items in wrong places.I found Items that weren't even in the book like the Behemoth Horn for Red XIII,It's on the steps in the Shinra building after the sister ray is installed.I've also got accessories that are not even mentioned in the book!Only other thing I really noticed was the listings of monster stats they were really messed up...I give it 3 stars cause it's the best mapping I've seen in a long time,every dungeon was mapped in the book just as on the game..."
4,This is a good book for second time players,"This is a good book with lot's of details especially important for beginners. Of course, I recommend not using a guide the first time around so as not to kill the experience. It is great for those who are going back for the fist time to get everything they missed. However, once past this stage, this book becomes useless as players start to commit to memory all of the information. Although it is still great for a reference guide to items, materia, and enemies. Also, this book doesn't contain all of the knitty-gritty secret stuff, but only things like Hidden Items. It says nothing about the Hidden Duel to get Final Attack or anything like that. Good Book..Good Buy"
3,"Nice production values, bad organization","While the writing is good and the production values utterly lavish, the maps are a disaster -- labelled with letters and numbers that don't often correspond with the legend, when there is a legend at all. More typical is the beastiary in the back: every monster has a pretty picture, but it's almost impossible to understand the icons used to show the enemies' attacks and what they're vulnerable to. Not the most practical guide, but a nice souvenir nonetheless."
4,Great hand book,"This book was ok, It left you needing a little more info in some spots, but overall realy helps you to fully enjoy and explore the game. If you have the game, get this book."
2,One messed up book,This book doesn't give you the total info like a strategy guide should. It has millions of errors and some things aren't true like the fact that a cactuar can be morphed into a tetra elemental and a tonberry can be morphed into a ribbon. All in all you shouldn't waste your money on this you shhould buy a better one or print one off the internet.
2,Incomplete & Inaccurate.,"I would recommend this book for someone who needs help with the ""basics"" of beating this game. For those of you who want to go back & Max Out your game with every spell, weapon, Materia, & secret, leave this on the shelf. I would have liked more detailed description & added effects of weapons & magic, Chocobo breeding,BUILDING UP LIMIT BREAKS! which this doesn't even mention. Morphing enemies & learning enemy skills, which it also doesn't mention. OK, but not great, or even good."
1,The only good thing about this guide is it's cover!,"To sum it all up this guide stinks. You can only put this book to use if you are a first time player. It gives you a few pointers but that's it. Like me, a true gamer, I want the good stuff. Where to find the secrets, a place for reference when I get lost, or an extra boost to beat a boss. This guide lacks all of this. My advise, go for the Brady Guides. They will supply you with secrets that you can actually use. On a final note, THIS GUIDE STINKS, PERIOD!!!"
4,best purchase,"This sunshade is amazing, it really does keep your car cooler. We live in New Mexico and have had 100+ temperatures here and it is great! Only complaint is that it is an awkward shape so hard to fold up and get out of the way."
4,Soundtrack to my summer in the UK,"This CD is truely a soundtrack to my summer in the UK. Nearly all the songs on the CD are regularly heard at clubs. The CD is unique. At times it is typically British with pop tunes from S Club 7. The best part of the CD is how it has included Garage and R&B music. My favorite track off the CD is ""Do you really like it?"", the song the converted me into a Garage fan."
1,Wrong color,"The ball was yellow not green like the package says, My grandon was really disapointed.They need to say the item isnt isnt as package says."
2,"This ball is YELLOW, not green.","The ball is easy to inflate and make ready. It is usable, but If you think you are going to get a GREEN hulk ball like pictured. You probably won't get that. The description says ""Color & design of ball may be different from pictured"" so, I feel fortunate it at least had the hulk on it. :)"
2,Too drying,This product left dry patches on my face. I have very oily skin so this was surprising. I gave my face a break and then tried again with half a pea size amount and received the same results. I am using this product on areas of my body which it doesn't seem to bother. For me this product did not work well and I would not repurchase.
2,Upcoming New Vegan Formulation,"I tried this product and loved it...then I read the reviews and was very disappointed to learn that there is equine (horse) oil in it, even though it is listed last in the ingredients, so it's a small quantity. I don't think I can put it on my face again, though.The good news is that I contacted Essential Formulas, and they said they are making an additional formulation (vegan) for distribution in the United States that will contain shea nut butter instead of the horse emollient. They are hoping that this new product will be available in June 2011."
1,dead horse in a bottle,"First, I love Dr. Ohhira's probiotics and have taken them for years. I expect more from this company that to use horse fat in a product. This is disgusting and unethical. It also makes me reconsider taking the probiotic from this company.I will not support a company that exploits horses. How pathetic that it is being touted as "" not tested on animals"" when animals are in the product. Shame on Essential Formulas!!"
5,5 STARS AIN'T ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Back in 1981, when djs played ""Your Love"", It would be impossible to find a space on the dance floor. The album was played every night time & time again for over a year if my memory hasn't fail me. Lime's debut is a classic example of Canadian disco at it's very best. All tracks on this album stands the test of time. They still sound great after almost a quarter of a century. I am listerning to it as I worte this. To me, ""Your Love"" is and always will be my #1 Disco Hit of all time."
5,Lime is Great,"As far as I am concerned, ""Your Love"" is the first song that got me hooked on the group. Their sound is exceptionally easy to listen to."
1,This CD does not contain the same tracks as the original.,"Buyer beware!!! Though titled ""Spicks and Specks"", this CD does not contain the same play list as the original ""Spicks and Specks"" album released in 1966 (rereleased in 1968 under the title ""Rare, Precious, and Beautiful""). It contains only 5 of the 12 songs on the original. The 20 songs it contains are excellent early-year Bee Gees songs to be sure, so if that's what you want this will meet your needs. But if you're looking for a CD version of the original album, this CD is misleadingly titled."
3,A few assembly problems,"It arrived great. Good packaging. it arrived as 2 boxes, the cart, and the top.After unpacking, it took me about 2 hours to assemble. All-in-all, it goes together like any other u-assemble furniture.However, the two side panel alignment dowels were misaligned by just enough that they wouldn't go together without some modifications. they were off by about 1/16"". Just enough to be a problem.One of the the back panel inserts was a little too tall. I had to trim about 1/16"" off it. Not sure if that was because of the dowel misalignment or not. Considering the panels were in the back, and problem dowel was in the front I don't see how.Maybe only 1 in 100 will have the same problem, so be warned.In the end, it's a nice looking cart and seems sturdy and will suit my need."
3,"TEST TUBE BABIES - Amazing Living, today!","Cheapo laughs hit up ""Test Tube Babies"" as a couple who are tired of some ""loose living"" decide that having children will fix the problem (sounds like growing up in my home town of Oshawa!). The doctor finds out he's sterile (maybe he's wearing speedos) so then the dozey lady finds out about the miracle of artificial incemination!The other short on this DVD is fun, but it's funny that it's so low budget that they even throw in the out of focus footage, complete with looped sound.TEST TUBE BABIES is a little soft tranfer wise, but it's still a fun deal at this price."
2,Not helpful for Nurse Practitioners,"This was a required book for graduate school for my Pediatric Nurse Practitioner Program. In my opinion, there are many more valuable pediatric Growth and Development books available (check Mandleco's book). I do not like the narrative approach of this book; it is vague."
2,Not the Seller's Fault,"This Taylor-Made support bar is sold by everyone in the marine busienss so I'm not bashing the reseller. The problem is, the plastic end pieces are susceptible to attack by UV light from the sun and they always end up deteriorating and ultimately falling apart within a couple of years. I've replaced at least 5 of them on my boat over the past 20 years. This is a design flaw and Taylor-Made ought to be ashamed. Somebody needs to make an all-aluminum or stainless version. I'd pay extra!"
5,Daniel Barenboim/Staatskapelle Berlin: Beethoven - Piano Concertos 1-5,"In PCM stereo, the orchestra sounds close and dry, rather like the Cleveland Orchestra in the classic Leon Fleisher audio-only set. Everything, including the piano, sounds much richer in the DTS surround version. The aspect ratio is 16:9, and the visual component offers great clarity and depth of color, even in shots where the color is limited mainly to that of the string instruments and music stands. I can't say that the utilitarian hall is much to look at in the background, except when the shadows along the walls begin to lengthen; the cycle was shot over the course of three days, around sunset each day, and you can see the natural light change over the course of each concerto. That's an unexpected extra in an attractive release."
5,Amazing Beethoven,"If I have criticism it has to be that the cameras don't do enough panning of the orchestra. They seem to be fixed on spots. Otherwise, it is amazing sound and crystal clear video. This is how I enjoy classical music and look forward to more on Blue ray."
5,"exceptional cd, I use it alot for relaxation during massage","Very much worth the money. I love this artist work, would recommend anything by him."
3,exactly what he needed.............,Inexpensive solution to a son's constant hockey bumps and brusies. Work well for the few dollars it costs. And it gets me out of massaging and stops him from overloading on ibuprofen
4,A Wonderful Gift,"I bought this item for my brother for Christmas. He is a contractor and not as young as he used to be and was complaining of body aches, sometimes severe. He told me it works good and he is happy to have it to help relieve his aches and pains. I would recommend this item to others."
3,Homedics,"The motors are not as strong as they used to be.I have arthritis, I use it everyday.I buy one every year."
2,wont help you if your back really hurts.,It feels decent just for the sake of the light vibrations but if you have tight muscles that honestly do need a massage this is not going to do anything for you. its just not strong enough being its just basicly a long pad with so so vibrations. the heat may help you go to sleep better maybe.
3,Warning! Not a true biography....,"Less than 50 pages are dedicated to Mckinley's childhood, schooling, Civil War days, and his rise in Ohio from a struggling attorney to a Congressman then state gov. The remaining 550 pages deal with the detailed issues of his presidency and some portions (such as several long chapters about Cuba & the Philippines) do not even mention him. Fortunately, his presidency with the various wars, his wife's condition, thru his assination makes this detailed account worthwhile. However, if you are like me & find the struggles of the person before the presidency (especially those with war experience) interesting, you will be somewhat dissappointed in the lack of info. here."
2,No thanks,"Silk is usually absolutely delicious. But it contains cane juice --- which translates to sugar. Besides for which, the plain flavor doesn't taste nearly as good as the others. Between the unrefined, organic, naturally milled, all that good stuff SUGAR and the not great taste, my take on this kind of Silk is especially ""Thanks, but no thanks."""
5,Great CD,"This is an awesome CD. If you know nothing about 311 and you just want to check them out, I recommend buying this greatest hits album. It's one of the best CD's I've bought."
3,It Pains me to give 311 3 Stars,"In my opinion, 311 is the most underrated group of this generation. All of their songs are wonderful, and anyone would be well served to pick up this cd.That being said, it disapoints me that there are no tracks from their first two albums, which, in many hardcore 311 fans, are the 2 best. To someone who's just getting into 311 I highly recommend this cd. It is a wonderful mix of what they sound like today. However, if you're looking to watch their sound evolve over the course of their career (which should be the point of best of's), then you'll be best off contacting me and I'll give you a list of tracks to burn."
5,great cd,just about every song is great and it has to since they have had a long career........the main good ones are from 1-10 and lovesong is a great song....ull enjoy the new songs aswell....a great buy
5,311 fan,"This Cd is very good, i recommend this CD to hard core 311 fans, and fans that just started listening to 311...all the songs are very amazing songs from a very amazing band..Rock On 311!!!"
3,these songs sound familiar...=P,"i was upset that such good songs like the ones that are on music and grassroots arent on here becasue they very well are their greatest hits BUT hey..the more underground they are the better, think about that!"
5,A nice collection of hits.....,"This disc is great for the person just discovering 311! All of the good hits are here....TRANSISTOR...DOWN...BEAUTIFUL DISASTER....and others. However, if you are a hardcore fan of 311 (like myself), you will still want to listen to the individual albums because their best songs were not released as singles. I am glad, though, that they did include the remake of the Cure's LOVE SONG on this CD as I just didn't have the heart to buy the 50 FIRST DATES soundtrack just for that song. And...what a nice remake they did at that! Way to go, guys! Like I said, it's a nice retrospective, but stick to the individual albums for optimum listening pleasure!"
4,Pretty good collection,"I've been a 311 fan since Music came out in the early 90's, seen them in concert a few times. All in al this is a pretty good collection of 311's work. Some good singles, a couple of heavy songs from thier early stuff, and a good collection from thier latter albums. If you are looking for a collection with a particular feel you might want to single out one of thier albums. However, if you're looking for a hits collection with a broad range of 311's music style over the years look no further. Good stuff!"
4,311 for dummies,"This is mostly an excellent gift to buy for somebody. This gives them at least a couple of reasons to introduce them to each of their cd's, so that they can join the 311 unity, mother_________!Basically, I own 311's 7 of 311 albums, and I wouldn't, buy this for myself. But if I wanted to get someone else into them, I would buy this. That's basically the only valid use for it, if you are already into them, don't buy this for yourself.If you don't have the three other songs, you can get those on iTunes. Don't buy this yourself, just great to give somebody a taste of what other 311 albums are like. Just remember to let Transistor grow on them. Make more people 311 fans by giving them as gifts. IF you are somebody who wants to get into them yourself, start with 311.7.0/10"
1,Why?,I've been an off and on 311 fan since Grassroots and I just found out they released a Greatest Hits CD. Wow. They must be desperate for cash. I'm trying to understand why bands release their so-called greatest hits when they're still active. It's a similar move we saw from the Red Hot Chili Peppers not too long ago - grab a dozen of your most popular songs and attach a single (to attract those of us who already own every one of their albums) and call it a greatest hits album. There are so many great 311 hits left off this album. They failed to include anything prior to their self-titled break-through to mainstream album. How can you leave off tracks from Grassroots and Music? I have to force myself to believe this is the record label trying to squeeze cash from the ill-advised consumer. I will never buy this album.
1,I'd give it ZERO stars if I could...,"Lord, this band sucks so bad! They make me cringe so hard when I hear them. A bunch of stupid white boys who think they're black/and or Jamaican. I hate when white boys talk with a Jamaican accent, how ridic is that?? And when they try to rap I wanna jump outta window. Anyways, 311 is, was, and always will be a terrible band; a band that has never quite ""gotten it"". They are absolutely NOT ""one of the greatest alternative bands ever"". Please! That lofty position is reserved for bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, etc. *NOT* 311. If you have to be stoned to think they're great, then they suck. Get over it."
4,"Enjoyable, if of course you like 311 like I do!","311 are one of my favorite bands, but their funky rock approaches was hit and miss over the years. Still, this greatest hits CD is about as good as it can be. Considering that 1993-2003 was a window of time in which the rock, pop, rap and metal music market went through a lot of changes, 311 still tried to stick to a formula that worked.Their music was energetic and often had a party antics type theme to it. From the songs ""Down"" ""All mixed up"" ""Transistor"" and ""Love Song"", this album is truly a collective song list that features their strongest efforts. I loved the lesser-known music they had over the years that the MTV generation may have missed, but this one is great because you get all the hits and then some. I always liked this band because they were not depressing or hateful in their songs, they made fun music!!"
4,Should have been called the Singles,"The reason this should be the singles collection is because it features all of the bands singles and only leaves a few out (Prisoner, Large In The Margin, and 8:16 A.M. are the only ones I can think of, but I'm sure there are not many if not any more). The fact is that many of these songs were not even hits (Eg; I'll be here a while, beyond the grey sky, and a few other), they were singles, but did not get a lot of media play.I would suggest getting all of their albums as oppose to buying this one. This album doesnt do the band justice as whether to judge if you like them or not. I would suggest getting this album and playing it when you have parties, that way youre sublime-jocking stoner buddies will think youre the man, and youll get poonany from [...]."
3,"good compilation, but ur missing out on alot more","this is a good compilation by 311. every song is good. no filler. this is perfect for the casual listener. but if u want to really get into 311 and really discover their music and talent, i recommend getting each of their albums separatly. remember that these are only singles, not their best songs (although these songs are good anyway). 311 is a great band, they put out alot of good music, but getting this album and judging them on that isn't fair to the band or you. like i said, this is a good casual album. not the best stuff from these guys, but good in its own right."
3,I didn't realize how many good songs they did,"their was a fair amount of filler, but 5 or so really good songs."
4,311's good choice of hits from 93-03,I think that this is a good album for them.. I think that they are a wonderful band and I have not listened to them very long. My Friend turned me on to them and I thank him for that. This includes lots of their best songs but it doesn't include all of them... I can't wait to hear what they think of next!
3,"Good, but....","311 were in their prime in the mid to late 90's and there are a few too many songs on here since then with much better songs like Gap, Misdirected Hostility and Random left off. I am also not a fan of putting new songs on a Greatest Hits package. Even if the new songs turn out to be great, and they usually are far from it, how are we or the record company to know this when they are new? Remove the 2 new songs, add Gap and Random and the CD would have been all the better for it. Too bad but it is still a good primer for new listeners."
5,The Best,This is a beast!!It is heavy enuff to smash thru the ice...Get this one..It is the best out there for the price!!!
2,Waste of Money,"I found this book to be primarily an exercise in self-delusion that was also disrespectful to the late John Lennon. Lennon, we are told, was also Robert Browning as well as Mozart in previous lives which certainly seems like a bit of overkill fame-wise. The dialogue is terribly corny, and the constructed experiences seem to often come out the author's children's book imagination. I believe there is a difference between a genuine psychic channeling experience and just taking a funny, mental trip. I couldn't possibly reccomend it, and honestly felt the purchase was a waste of money."
1,John didn't believe in god...................,"You missed it. John did not even believe in god but knew that we are all wonderful without any kind of religious experience. Listen to IMAGINE, then rethink your book."
2,Imagine. . .that this is a non-fiction book,"Linda Keen provides the reader with a very imaginative view of the afterlife and reincarnation in this colorful story. The first couple of chapters are believable, however, when we learn that John Lennon was Mozart and Robert Browning. . .it becomes less believable. Towards the end of the book, the ""journey"" seems more like a really good acid trip than an actual psychic encounter."
3,Jury is Still Out,"I won't dispute the other reviewers' comments about this bracelet being attractive. It is very nice looking. The one thing I was shocked about was how light this is. At first I thought this was rose colored plastic. Granted, it is stamped 14k and ITALY and everything is soldered, but the weight seriously made me question. They must be rolling these sheets out paper thin in order to make the links. So if you're looking for a bracelet with some weight, best keep looking."
3,Yet Another Fad Diet,"The author's story is certainly compelling. In my mind it just goes to show how adaptable the human body is. The food plan succeeds, in my humble opinion, because the author is eating at the extremes. The high protein diet would typically cause severe ketosis. This is counteracted by the highly alkalizing vegetable drink, There is virtually no fiber to speak of which will eventually lead to colon problems I'm sure. The gastrointestinal tract REQUIRES fiber to keep things moving along; it needs the fiber so there is enough bulk moving through the system to push things along. A high protein and vegetable juice diet provides almost no fiber. This can't be good long term.Some of the recipes are interesting and even tasty. It was a fun read though the diet appears flawed. For some recipes and an eating approach that is both tasty and healthy try Nourishing Traditions by Sally Fallon."
2,"Some of It You've Heard, But It's the Stuff You Haven't That Will Make You Gag","I am on the fence about much of the ""eating raw"" craze. While I don't think anyone can disagree that high-heat cooking can be problematic, I don't necessarily believe that all-raw is an effective cure-all either. While I find the premise suspect, I found one element of the book downright disgusting - the author details a story of a woman whose health was restored from eating poop. Yes, you read that correctly - poop - as in feces. That made me close the book for good thinking that this is reading for white folks with dreadlocks who wear patchouli oil and think they smell good."
4,Teaching Your Children About God,"I really enjoyed this book. David J. Wolpe is a wonderful Author. The first book I ever read of his was "" In Speech and In Silence: The Jewish Quest for God"" , it was a little difficult, because of the vocab,but it taught me a lot in my search of understanding faith in God from the Jewish point of view. ""Teaching Your Children About God"" is another masterpiece. This tells you in detail,from using the first angle of a childs imagination to teach them about the Lord, To common aspects of God we should teach our children such as Gods Love and Justice and Prayer.It also touches on the hard things in life such as death. Read this book even if you don't have kids it will give you a step by step approach to life and faith in God from aspects the we as adults every now and than need to revisit."
3,St. Joseph medal,"The medallion is ok, not great. I am afraid the chain will tarnish on my son's neck. Not really worth the $19.95."
1,"Enamel comes off after a few uses, poor quality for a finish","Tried it again, because it is such a fun color. Finish has a few bubbles in it. Hope it lasts. Oct 2011It appears perfect for washing those small amounts of fruits and veggies. However, after a few uses the enamel starts to chip off. Does not matter if you hand wash it or rinse with warm water....I have had two, babied them and they both chipped within a month or two. Buy something else, inferior finish."
5,WoW!,Brazilian legend from forty years ago still rollicks through one complex riff after another without seeming to take a breath.
3,"""Not Bad Comedy!""","John Ritter and Vincent Gardenia star in this 1989 comedy.A writer tries getting a handle on his life and reconnectingwith his ex-wife. This isn't bad and John was great in it asusual. This dvd has decent picture and sound, but only thetrailer. I recommend this."
5,John Ritter kills it!,"I'm sad that this movie was always marketed as ""the comedy that glows"", a reference from one of it's more ""slapsticky"" scenes involving glow in the dark condoms, and not given the credit it deserves, like the Oscar Noms ""As Good as it Gets"" got. Skin Deep in my opinion, though 80's dated looks wise, is still a far superior drama/comedy.John Ritter should have been nominated for this performance, PERIOD.Ritter's more serious scenes are up there with the best actors of our time, and the comedy, especially the physical comedy (leaving electro-therapy scene, OMG, I have to rewind it several times because I can't see the scene all the way through from laughing so hard) is evidence that Buster Keaton & Chaplin have passed the torch to our dear beloved clown John Ritter. And come on, this is directed by Blake Edwards, an icon."
5,Fantastic .........and ........Funny,"First I want to say that I was never a fan of Threes Company. I never watched the show, oh maybe once or twice to see what the hoopla was all about back then. Then I saw this movie and I felt that John Ritter was one of the funniest men alive. I thought the movie worked from the beginning to the end with his character being the greatest drunk since ARTHUR.It is sad that we have lost Mr. Ritter but I hope many more people will enjoy this movie."
2,For Diana only...,"A mediocre, unfunny and old-fashionned moovie. The only reason why I give it 2 stars are the scenes featuring DIANA BARTON. She totally lights up the film with her unique and sensual ways. Diana is without a doubt one of the most beautiful actress in the world. Watch ""Skin Deep"" for her!"
2,"Well, Raye Hollitt is beautiful","This movie has been wildly overpraised here, in my opinion. What can't be overpraised is the physique of Raye Hollitt, who has a short, memorable scene as a female bodybuilder who gives John Ritter's character more than he bargained for. Her muscular body is breathtakingly beautiful, providing for one of the sexiest scenes in recent movie history. The rest of the movie I could do without. Merely OK."
4,Skin Deep,"Great old movie from my past. Language is a little harsh for some people, but very entertaining anyway. Will make you laugh. Not a movie for the kids."
4,skin deep review,"Firstly, I don't and never did like John Ritter. But for some reason, he was funny as hell in this movie. This is an excellent and entertaining adult comedy to see with your spouse and/or loved one. There are scenes in this movie (which I have watched dozens of times) where I crack up just knowing about what is to happen...I'm thinking of one now when he wraps himself up in toilet paper while completely drunk ""cause I was cold"""
3,Good enough,"This movie had some funny scenes. If you are into FBB's, you'll love the scene with Lonnie (Raye Hollit) roughly 25 minutes into the movie, where she flexes her muscluar body, then takes Zack (John Ritter) to bed. ..."
4,Only two word.FUNNY!HILLARIOUS!,"The first time that I have seen this movie was two years ago.It was so funny that my mouth was very tired after seeing this flick.It'll be worth seeing it.They say that A movie called 'Analyze ****' was a real funny movie.Hey do you think that was a real funny movie?I don't think so.It wasn't worth being no.1 on the box office.There's a saying 'You can find a 24k gold ring even in a trash can' Yes you can.Skin deep isn't that much a famous movie.(But there was an excutive producer called Joe Roth!!)But it's a real super funny movie.Not even this movie,but there's a numbers of real good entertaining movies like this one.So....see it!"
3,Tv movie was dumb hope it is diffrent on video,"I have scene the tv version and I laughed a little but when I heard some of the reviews by these funny people on here it seemed hillarious. So today I am supposed to buy a copy. I am only 14 but my mom saw 10 when she was little so she knows that I can control myself just the way that she did. Her mother said when they saw 10, ""Is this too much for you honey."" So tonight i will repost a better review. But til then this is the tv version rating ***out of *****"
1,Dragged in several places....,"Fell asleep while watching this movie, twice! It started out well enough, but then kept getting bogged down with all the scenes where he just talks to the bartender or to the shrink.Never would have rented it except to see Robert Dowdell (VTTBOTS) in a bit part...."
1,Please Don't Say You Like This Movie,"This is the definitive one-star movie. Major studio, proven director, interesting idea. Completely awful. I felt bored, used, and soiled watching this horrible film. See all Blake Edwards' films before this one. In fact, just watch ""The Party"" and ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and leave it at that. Life is too short."
4,From What I Remember,"I remember growing up with the pictures of glow in the dark condoms and body building seductresses floating around in my head from the time I was 14-19 y/o. This movie is Hilarious and (to me)tends to make more sense to aging delinquents who sort have been in those situations. What also stuck with me was how empty this character's life seemed to be even after all the sex and games (which, is every boy's definition of heaven). There's this one song in the movie that I've been trying to get my hands on for over 20 some odd years titled (I think) ""Falling Out of Love."" If anyone has any info on how I can finally put this search to rest it will be much appreciated. Good movie.. and, aquired taste."
4,Slap Your Leg Funny Movie!,"John Ritter is in great physical comedy form for this movie. I laugh so loud every time I watch the ""condom scene"" or ""bodybuilder in bed scene."" Plus, it's got a great music score highlighted by a terrific, haunting ballad, ""Falling Out Of Love."" This is a great addition to any movie library"
5,Singing Machine STVG-535,This machine was a hit at Christmas for our 10 year old grandson and his 6 and 7 year old sisters. It was fun having an oldfashion sing along!
1,Piece of Junk,I cannot believe they actually sell this thing. Quality is incredibly low and we got an error message half way through most songs that required us to reboot it constantly. Shipped it back today. Lame Christmas present.
5,Such a fast read...,"This book covers Charles Bukowski from his earliest memories at the age of two, up until he is twenty years old. Every part of this book is entertaining, from his classroom antics and lineup of outcast friends, even down to his frequent beating at the hand of his father - which he get so used to, that they didn't even affect him after a while. What a miserable first twenty years he went through. Just when he starts to hit his stride, he comes down with what a doctor decribes as the 'worst case' of acne vulgaris he had ever seen. He didn't catch too many breaks in life - seemily not until the times he experienced in his novel ""Women"", another great book. I'm reading HoR again and I just finished it a few weeks ago."
3,Worth reading for Bukowski fans.,This book is about Hanks early years and his miserable upbringing.This brings a new light to Hank but you find out he is even more unlikeable in his youth.
2,Ham on Rye,"Not what I expected. I read the whole book, but I didn't like it, it was not my style of reading. I would not recommend it."
5,The psychology and sociology of Charles Bukowski.,The best sociological and psychological account of growing up in Hollywood fiction has ever produced. Charles Bukowski at his best.Ham On Rye by Charle Bukowski ISBN: 0876855583
5,A silly dennis the menace sex driven drinking adventure*#!%!,"It was probably one of the first books that made me laugh out loud in a long time. i was sitting in the lancaster library and people were looking at me, wondering what the hell i was reading. it reminded me of me and the way i saw the world when i was a kid. i guess it still looks the same. the world that is........ i could read it again and again. sometimes i try to find some of the places he talks about. it's a must read boooooookkkk!!!!!!"
3,Little sympathy for the Devil,"I found this to be a well written book. There was certainly a lot of character development, and the environment was constructed nicely. However, I kept waiting for some sort of redeeming qualities of the main character, Henry. He seems to be pretty unforgivable. I will say that I had the same feelings about Catcher in the Rye, and people really enjoy that book. I would suggest this book to those that enjoy the Nihilistic style, but I would not go back and read it again."
5,Wonderful Book,"This is the first Bukowski novel I have read and it is incredible. It gives an insight as to what his childhood might have been like. He describes it through the life of Henri Chanaski. One can't help but to sympathize with the main character. This book is wonderful and although I am not a very skilled reader, I found it very easy to read. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down."
3,A classic,"Bukowski writes with a grittiness I love. His stories are always very interesting but, like many of his stories lack any real closure."
3,Spotty misfits of the world unite,"Bukowski is the writer that pimpley-faced middle-class boys turn to when they want to feel a bit bad, a bit tough. He isn't a very good writer but he is the dirty old alcoholic uncle you (perhaps) wished you had when you were younger. 'Ham on Rye' is certainly not literature but it might amuse you, particularly if you happen to fall into the 13-18 year old category or enjoy Benny Hill. Bukowski is unable to articulate a single genuine emotion without resorting to obscenity. I gave it three stars as it is the funniest door prop I own."
3,Unnecessary,"I have to say I was a bit disappointed with Bukowski's autobiography. It lacked the humor and immediacy of his other writings. Not sure why he felt the need to lay out his life in such explicit terms, especially since his books generally tend to be autobiographical. He is at his best in books like Post Office, which have a James Thurber quality, albeit a bit raunchier in his take on life. Still, it is his poetry and short stories that stand out. Bukowski had a way of capturing those odd moments like no one else, even when delving into the seemier aspects of his life. But that ability was sorely lacking in this book."
1,Not a Fan,"I love reading autobiographical type books.............I have seen review after review giving this book 5 stars and statements about how absolutely great this book is. Maybe I just didn't get it but this was one of the most boring books I have ever attempted to read (I stopped reading about half way through the book). I don't get all the hoopla around this book. I was not impressed at all..........If it weren't for the profanity I would have thought this book was written for elementary school students. I'm sorry to all of the fans, but this was AWFUL."
5,This is the finest novel by one of America's great writers,"Ham on Rye is the finest novel by one of America's greatest writers. It is hillarious, sad, devastating and right on the money about growing up an outsider. This is a must read for anyone interested in 20th century American literature."
4,Dirt-filth-horror-salvation,"Yeah, I probably understood the idea of the ""noble drunk"" before I read this. I may have even been one; in a manner of speaking. I was definitely drunk. Buckowski likes to read and drink and tell what's on his mind. These qualities make him a clear-cut role model for the aspiring drunken hipster, as he sets a template for behavior that is amoral, yet ethical. He doesn't stand for phony-baloney golden rulism, just honesty and willfullness. In a way, he can be read as a sort of Buddhist in the way he recognizes his own id as well as the ids of others. This book is simply one of the best chapters in what is really one gigantic work that spanned his lifetime."
5,The place to start with Buk.,"Bukowski's novels (at least the ones I've read) all put together seem to be one long autobiography. Although this one was written later, it is the begining of the story, his childhood. Therefore I would recommend Ham on Rye as the perfect book to start with. Factotum picks up where Ham on Rye leaves off. Which follows into Post office and then Women. By reading them in this order you can follow Henry Chinaski (the main character) from childhood to old age. I am a big fan of Bukowski's novels although I have nothing in common with Henry Chinaski I completely understand his world-view. He reminds us that no one goes further than those who start at the botttom."
5,"Blunt, brutal and entertaining.","If you know nothing about Bukowski this is a good place to start. You'll have a MUCH clearer picture long before you finish. This book is somewhat biographical though it claims to be fiction. With Bukowski anything is plausible and if it didn't happen to him as told in the book it probably could have. Sometimes I think he's a genius and other times he seems to me as just a drunk misogynist with some writing skills. You decide.If you do enjoy this you might consider renting ""Barfly."" This movie, starring Mickey Rourke, came out around 1987. Rourke seems to have captured the essence of Bukowski on film."
3,An enjoyable account of a crude childhood,"A feel-good novel this is not.""Ham on Rye,"" this reader's first encounter with the author, was a relatively quick read about a rather painful childhood of Harry Chinaski, a German-American kid with an anti-conformist bent so pronounced that Holden Caulfield would tell him to cheer up.Chinaski is miserable in life - with his family, his school, and his economic standing. To cope, he turns to schoolyard violence and terrible habits, giving the reader a front seat into the world of a guy who makes nothing but bad decisions but keeps living in spite of himself.For those interested in modern literature, this book is a great example of dark anti-heroism."
2,Good to the halfway mark,"The first half of this movie is well-done: good acting, good direction, surprising dialogue and surprising changes of fortune. The movie fell apart for me midway through when two of the main characters get into an argument following an unconsummated adult encounter in a hotel room. Their argument is bitter, nearly endless, and makes you dislike the more spiteful of the two characters intensely.The first half of the movie balances entertainment and realism well. The second half of the movie loses the balance and is a chore to watch, primarily as one of the main characters, a college instructor, becomes whining, depressive, and intolerable."
2,But there's one saving grace!,"I'll level with you...this is a lame movie with mediocre acting & totally uninteresting characters. It starts out strong & shows some promise but, just give it another 10 minutes....your thumb will find the eject button. HOWEVER, there is one saving grace....her name is Lacey Chabert! Trust me, guys (and girls who like other girls), you should really rent this flick just to see the delicious Lacey in rare form! This adorable morsel (who was age 23 at the time of filming in 2005), absolutely has one of THE Best figures I've ever seen!! Unfortunately, we don't get to see all of her (which is seriously weak for an unrated film!) but, our girl does juuuust fine. Skip to chapters 9 & 10, and see if you agree. ;)"
3,Not Bad,The movie wasnt bad but could have been better. If you like indi-films then you will really enjoy this flic.
3,Lacey Chabert,Lacey Chabert was the only reason this movie was purchased. That one scene wasn't the only good thing about this movie.
4,Something different - like Pulp Fiction was .......... You decide?,"You can see Andrzej Sekula's presence. I enjoyed the familar faces in this somewhat twisted film. Is it worth watching? Yes, I enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to more movies from these folks. Someday I would like to meet Meatloaf."
3,Get the original 13 Track ending The Christmas Blues,"I would not have minded if the added material without taking some away. Sadly that's not what happened. What many reviewers call for I have in my hand. The 1989 CD from Capitol ""CDP 7 93115 2"" with a UPC of ""0 7777-93115-2 1"" is the original 13 songs ending in The Christmas Blues. The 1989 CD included all material printed in the USA.1. A Winter Romance2. Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!3. Things We Did Last Summer, The4. I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm5. June in January6. Canadian Sunset7. Winter Wonderland8. Out in the Cold Again9. Baby, It's Cold Outside10. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer11. White Christmas12. It Won't Cool Off13. The Christmas BluesThe CD I list is six out of five stars."
5,A Winter Romance indeed!,"A Winter RomanceThis is a classic 1959 album by Dean Martin with 4 bonus tracks. Not quite a Christmas album, but a very good winter album. A great cd to drink maple whisky too."
3,Winter Romance Import Style,"This is an import entitled ""Winter Romance"". However, it is not the original configuration of the release by Dean in 1959 bearing the same title. It does include all the original songs from the 1959 release and for you collectors out there, it is not the original ""ski chalet"" album cover either. This import includes additional songs that were not included on the original album such as the hit ""On An Evening in Roma"". as well as ""How Do You Speak to an Angel"" and ""Solitaire"" amongst others. But it is the inclusion of these songs that seem to diminish the original concept of this ""seasonal"" recording. These songs just don't seem to mesh with the songs from the original ""Winter Romance"" recording, thereby detracting from the continuity of the original album. It is for this reason the mediocre rating. However, the original ""Winter Romance"" recording in its orignal format is a five star recording and worth searching out."
5,Great Holiday LP from Dean Martin,"This great album from Dean Martin is more than just a holiday classic. It's a wintertime standard, with him in top Rat Pack-type form, referring to Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer as ""Rudy"". Highly recommended."
2,"Nice footage, poor PC compatibility & service","I received this camcorder as a gift, and although the footage I've shot has been good quality, I cannot download it on to my PC. I have a brand new PC and it appears the driver that came with the camcorder is not compatible with XP Media Center. I've attempted to contact Samsung to confirm these allegations but they will not return my calls or emails. So I've got hours of raw Mini DV footage that I can't edit on my computer. What's the point??? Needless to say, I'll be buying a new Mini DV camcorder soon, and it will not be Samsung. So far Panasonic has my vote."
4,Hydrofarm BUAB48 48-Inch AgroBrite Fluorescent Grow Light Bulb,"I bought these for an indoor garden. I had the fixture. They provide more than adequate light for most kinds of plants. We brought in many of our flowering garden plants, including our climbers, and a small rose bush. The light is suspended above the lattice about 5 ft over the garden and seems to be sufficent to keep most plants green and growing."
3,Not what I thought they were,"I bought these anticipating to have a nice blueish/reddish glow to them. They do not, I'm just started a indoor garden for some vegetables and medicinal plants. I just got them installed today and not sure how they will perform as of yet. I do gotta say they don't blink and are solid lamps that give off like a off-white glow to them. I installed them in a shop style hood that I took from my garage. In the next few weeks or months I'll continue this review to let ya know how my plants are responding to the light.Update-These lamps produce less heat then regular flourescent lights."
1,"Not delivered, No response, No refund","I found out about this company on TV and thought it was a cool gag gift for a bachelor party. But after placing my order well in advance, I received absolutely no response from the company. After repeated emails and calls over the course of several WEEKS, I finally asked for a refund. When I finally got a response, the person agreed but never followed through with the refund.I'm sure they get it right once in a while. But they could not have gotten it more wrong with my order. There are many other mullet wig vendors out there. I'd rather work with someone that valued my business."
4,"Easy to clean, looks great","Bought this as a second cover, but we like it better than what the highchair came with! Wipes clean easily. Fits great on our Eddie Bauer chair. Easy to put on / take off. And it looks cute :)"
3,Simplistic Style.,"The writer of this book, uses a very basic and simple writing style which makes it easy to read, but leaves a lot to be desired.The fight between the two powerful witches (good and bad) should have been detailed and become a key point in the book. The author cuts us short and just tells us who won.When he wants to be frightening, he isn't. Instead of writing really scary material, he goes for the gross out. But since the gross out is so gross, he should at least get 3 stars or be committed."
3,Disappointing for a 2nd Edition,The book is a reasonable resource.I was disapointed in the number of typos and errors in the code in the book. I was more disappointed in the lack of mention of these errors in the errata section of the web-site.Unfortunately this has been my experience with the last few books I purchased so perhaps that's just what to expect.The text is clear and easy to understand. It covers the basics of creating a report and covers most of the features in at least a cursory way and others in depth.Even though disappointed I think the book is a useful resource.
3,Is this a really profesional?,"I am developing VB.NET application and this applications needs to print out several reports and I have found out that one of the reports is very complex. I have heard of how ""ease-of-use"" is Crystal Report, and I buy this book and try to find out if this book can offer me solutions to build the type of report I want. To my disappointment, it cannot produce the report.The complex report is like this: I have 3 tables. One is header and the other two are details tables.The header and the details are linked by a primary and foreign key. Whatever matched in the header primary key, the detail records must be shown. (Left outer join I will say). One of the detail tables must display the record in horizontally and the other detail table must display the record vertically. I know this can be achieve if I use programming to program it, but it time consuming and more effort have to be consumed."
1,I could learn more by banging on my head with a shoe,"It isn't bad enough that neither Microsoft nor Crystal have a practical approach to help people utilize these two technologies effectively, there are actually people writing books that provide the same disservice to those of us developers that just want task specific answers. The last thing that this book does is demonstrate how to integrate Crystal Reports and .NET for any real world useage. After reading this book I don't know how to display and manipulate reports over the web by utilizing user interactivity through parameters passing, but I can make the background a pretty blue color!"
2,Leaves a lot to be desired,"The book appears to have been rushed to the publisher. It spends a page and a half on a simple procedure and a quarter page on something very complicated. It goes through ""getting started"" well but lacks the necessary information to carry the ""Professional"" title."
2,This book is not good,Actually I purchased this book few months back. Today my opinion is this book is not upto the mark. It is only blah blah blah. No topic is covered in detail. I needed to search web for many things after reading this book. He is nowhere discussing crystal reports SDKs in detail. We wont get any overview of crystal reports SDKs provided with visual studio.
2,Should have included more detail in the web forms chapter,"I bought the book for the web forms chapter and I found it to be too brief. There is no information about dynamic select statements or parameters as the data source for the reports, only static data sources. The author uses windows forms when he covers these topics.I am still searching for a good crystal reports.net reference.MCSD, MCDBA"
4,I CANT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN,"""Mind Siege"" After reading this book I think ""How could it get a bad rating""? Depends on your views in life and about yourself. Personally I find the book to be enlightning. Although I don't agree with everything in the book.If you like Non-fiction and enjoy reading a book that could cause you to question yourself, and/or even improve yourself as a person this is a great book !"
5,"Straight From Capitol Hill-- Washington, D.C.","If you want to know what has distorted our culture and infected our Federal Government-- read this book. As a staff member for a Congressman, I see these forces working in unseen ways that the average Christian does not get the opportunity to see or flatly ignores. This book illustrates why politics is an EXCELLENT, though trying, profession for Christians and why Christians have a civic duty to be involved.Some write in saying this book is hogwash. If you are a believer and believe in absolute truth, you will read and learn. No doubt about it. You will learn why you must pray for elected officials who share your viewpoints. They are the ones who stand between you and Humanist tyranny."
1,The religious right's Mein Kamph,"In this book Tim LaHaye and his associate, David Noebel, have produced the religious right's American Mein Kampf. If one would substitute the word ""Jew"" in this book for the the word ""humanist"" it would be identical to Hitler's vicious hatred of the of the Jews as written in Mein Kampf. The authors tell the world that every evil known to man in America is caused by these horrible humanists. No exception. Bring on the gas chambers!"
1,What founding fathers are you referring to?,"The colonists? Or the non-christian Native Americans whose lands were stolen by Jesus worshippers who then founded this ""great"" nation?"
5,All honesty and wit...,"A great CD from a songwriter who, in the tradition of Joe Henry, has his tongue nearly always in cheek. Each song is unique, decorated with sweet female backup vocals, singing cello, a muscular rhythm section, or, as on the superb ""Open Window"" (also available on Paint Chip Records' ""Sink Into Solo"" at PaintChipR@aol.com), a spare drum program and tremelo guitar. A must-have for anyway who enjoys SMART songwriting."
3,Hot Sex w/annoying female lead,"I enjoyed the world Marilyn Lee has created of hot lusty vampires. Serge Dumount is head over heels in love w/ Derri Morgan, whom happens to be such a pain in the ass.I really hated the way she would berate Serge as I was reading this. I think Marilyn Lee wanted conflict between the two-the classic story of one falling for the other while the other falls in love....eventually. I think you could have conflict and tension w/o the heroine being so annoying.I enjoyed her previous book, The Talisman, very much. Derri's friend Cassy is a very likeable character, who wasn't wimpy, but didn't have to be nasty in order to be strong and determined.I still enjoyed this book, I would love to see her do a story on the sexy bi-racial vampire, Alex. It would be wonderful to read about him in bloodlust!"
3,If you like Omega-Males then....,"If you like Omega-Males then this is the book for you. The hero (Serge)is a wimp and the heroine (Derri) doesn't have to try hard to wrap him around her finger. By the end of the story Derri has got Serge so under her thumb that she's choosing his underwear!As for the ""steamy"" love scenes don't hold your breath for maraton sessions. Serge is quick off the mark, not once but TWICE. I give this story 3 stars because it's very funny and well written. But if you like Alpha-Males then opt for Jaid Black, Susan Johnson, Christine Feehan, Dara Joy. It's a shame because Marilyn Lee can write, but this guy just didn't do it for me. A strong woman like Derri needed an equally strong man."
1,CO2 Firepower Raider,"Well I just got this gun a hour ago along with my brother in law we put out over $70.00 each. We left the store thinking it would be fun to try them out on the weekend. When I got home my brother in law was on the phone, man my safty just fell out in 2 parts right in my hand no surprize to me so had mine. It dose not even seem to be plastic some kind of backcolite or some junk. I have been useing air powered guns for over 25 years I have seen good and bad but never have I seen junk like this $70.00 who are you kidding this thing is not worth $10.00. I'am so glad I did not get the chance to put air on it the cheap parts this gun is made up of would most likely have blown up in my face. I was warned by every one who knows anything about airsoft to stay away from this brand and now I know why for your own safty!!!!!!! If you do not give it at least one star you can't post?"
2,Work fine... for a while...,"I also had this guy fall apart on me, the had gotten stuck and while I was trying to fix it, a piece fell off. Great gun if you want to hassle with it."
4,Hard to find CD - a special show,"I saw the show in Hollywood back in the 60's and it always stuck with me. The vinyl copy I bought at the time is a terrible pressing, so this is great to have. The equalization leaves a lot to be desired, but a little bit of work with today's digital processing - I use DC7 software - drew out a much better and natural sound."
5,"""Bloodhymns"" The 2nd best NECROPHOBIC release!!!","I can't believe how under-rated these guys are! Since I get to be the first reviewer, I will blow it up. Yes, this is the 2nd best Necrophobic release. The guitar work is once again devastating, the riffs are equal parts evil and catchy - exactly what you want with Death Metal. The drumming is great, and more extreme than their other releases. On their debut, there was not one blast beat. Now they use the blasting regularly, and it fits perfect. The vocals are out of control, they are just SICK! The bassist (Tobias) took over on vocals after ""The Nocturnal Silence"" and I like his vocals even better than Anders (the vocalist on their debut...) The sound quality is a little more compressed than their other releases, in other words, it's less separated but more tight. If you like: Suffocation, Soul Reaper, Dissection, Dark Tranquility, or Decapitated, you will enjoy Necrophobic"
3,Cannery Row sequel,"This novel is Steinbeck's sequel to his very successful CANNERY ROW, which was published in 1945. The book revolves around Doc and the prostitute Suzy; everyone in Cannery Row thinks that Doc needs to get married (his life is in a funk), and that Suzy is the best prospect (her honesty is her key feature). Doc isn't sure he agrees with everyone else about getting married, and Suzy doesn't think she's worthy of him. But the inevitable must occur, of course, and with everyone doing the best they can to get the two together, they finally decide to tie the knot.Steinbeck had a musical comedy in mind when he wrote this, but his attempt at lighthearted humor is not his forte. The big party with the goofy costumes is more silly than funny; better is when Suzy describes the man who would be perfect for her and Doc tells her that's him to a T, but she doesn't believe him. The ending is fairly predictable as the two principals stumble toward it. Not one of Steinbeck's major achievements."
5,Cannery Continued,"John Steinbeck is truly one of the 20th century's greatest authors. Sweet Thursday continues the exploits of Doc, Mack and the gang after WWII. Steinback writes with a sweet hopefullness about the goodness of mankind. If you liked Cannery Row this is a worthy sequel."
3,My Least favorite of all his books.,"I almost never bother to write a negative book review but on Sweet Thursday I'll make that exception. I have read every single book that John Steinbeck published and I enjoyed every single one of them, except this one. It rambled on and on, wasn't focused in the least, didn't hold my attention. I only kept reading because I expected it to get better. But it didn't and I must confess, I never made it much more than half way through it.It is odd too, because Steinbeck is a real master, a fabulous writer, creator of stories and charters that will outlast most of us. But this one didn't get it for me, this one could have used more editing. Still, one dog out of so many great books, it is a darn good record. By the way, just finished reading Down to a Soundless Sea, by his son, Thomas Steinbeck, and I was quite impressed with it...great stories, fine writing. Check it out and take a pass on Sweet Thursday."
3,Not anywhere near the original,"It seems like Steinbeck tried a little too hard to be witty, too hardto be philosophical, too hard to be human and sweet. What made the originalCannery Row so enjoyable was its relaxed style and atmosphere. This bookis fun to read, but still is coerced. I guess sequels never do work out . . ."
4,Cannery Redux,"I read ""Cannery Row"" years ago with some generally good impressions. Later I watched the rather lame movie version and I was reminded that humor was not Steinbeck's forte. I mention this because the first few pages of ""Sweet Thursday"" led me to think that I was going to get more tired scenes of old reprobates catching frogs at night. I perservered and, as soon as page 22, I was making margin notes for future reference. There is humor in ""Sweet Thursday"" and some of it is pretty good. However, it is Steinbeck's frequent forays into human psychology that kept my attention.I suspect that this group of misfits was a good laboratory for Steinbeck to tests his theories and write down his observations. There is a rather off-beat romance that seemed predictable although in an unpredictable way. I actually got to liking many of the characters although some were still a bit much. Somehow this mixture of high brow and low brow works out pretty well. I'm ready for some more Steinbeck!"
2,Sweet Thursday,"I ordered this book on the 15th of April, it was sent the 19th and I did not receive it until May 3rd. This was too long of a time and I had to read it in two days for our book club."
1,A terrible let-down,"The sequel to Steinbeck's best work turns out to be one of his worst: bland, unimaginative, contrived to a fault, unfunny, and totally lacking of any of the wisdom and insight into the ways of human beings that graced ""Cannery Row"". The happy ending with Doc and the hooker is totally implausible if you take into account the way this man was portrayed in Steinbeck's other works. ""Sweet Thursday"" does not detract from the qualities of ""Cannery Row"" - but it certainly left me wondering just what possessed Steinbeck to ignore the truism that certain books (this is one of them) are best left unwritten."
4,Cuts to the basics of humanity.,"Steinbeck has a unique ability to portray simple exploits of life and weave them into lessons of life that we should all know. He understands the ideosyncracies of the human spirit and subtleties that many individuals don't often pick up on. This is a great, relaxing read, from which many of us can learn a great deal.Many readers may disagree with my analogies, but with Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday, Steinbeck is actually a lot like a Seinfeld. He can take seemingly uninteresting situations, and develop them into humorous portrayals of quirky people. He takes personalites that everyone is familar with, and just stretches with a little neuroses."
4,A must read,"Steinbeck gives birth to fully formed characters about as well as any modern author, and the characters in ""Sweet Thursday"" are some of the loveliest in literature. They all have their warts; they all have their peculiarities; they all expose a little heart sometimes as well. I'll bet you'll find a bit of yourself in this tossed-salad of humanity. I loved ""Cannery Row"" and Steinbeck doesn't miss a step in this sequel. You don't have to read ""Cannery Row"" first, but I'd recommend it. And if you liked ""Cannery Row"", you have to read ""Sweet Thursday""."
5,Excellent!,"Hell In a Very Small Place is a masterful and, I felt, at times moving account of a classic battle. Superbly researched and well written, the book was hard to put down. A must for military history readers!"
4,America should've learnt the lesson...,"For any fan of military history, and particularly for those interested in America's involvement in South-East Asia, ""Hell In A Very Small Place"" is crucial reading. It is long and it is packed with enormous detail, but it tells a fateful story very well. After having read most of the literature on 60's Vietnam and the `American War' it was an eye-opener to learn of the role that the then US administration played in the French war of the 50's. 20/20 hindsight's a dangerous thing but after having read Fall's book one does wonder why the lessons of Dien Bien Phu and France's experience in Indo-China were not taken on board to a greater degree by subsequent American governments."
5,Hell in a very small place,A book details the French involvement in Indochina at Dien Bien Phu. Another book that is hard to put down. Very interesting and based on actual documents of the French Army and the Viet Minh.
3,Rough Gem,Crest of the Stars is at the top of my lists of things that I would love to see redone better. Hiroyuki Morioka's story is excelent and the anime respected it. For SF fans it is something worth watching and thinking about. It's ideas on war and combat on a galactic scale are outstanding!The production and direction of this series are below average and the English dub is absolutely awful! That goes for the follow ons as well.I don't think that many people would watch long enough to find the strength of the story and that's sad.
4,The perfect Father's Day or stocking stuffer joke gift!!!,"This is a hilarious, clever book that is perfect for poking gentle fun at the man in your life, whether dad, husband, or brother. The book is done in a kitschy 50's style that makes it even more fun to peruse."
3,Keep it by the toilet,"Don't expect to read this book and know how to care for a lawn. It is basically a bunch of 1 page tips and suggestions on what the author thinks a man should know. I like a lot of them.Naturally, one would find plenty to disagree with in this book. We are men, after all..."
4,No promotion yet...,"Blaising is (still) Executive VP and Provost at SWBTS.Paige Patterson is President.As a SWBTS alum, I did a double-take at the description, thinking something had happened I didn't hear about."
5,A great CD for romance.,"The original French version of ""Un Homme et Une Femme"" is a fabulous CD, incredibly transporting and intimate. Why isn't it available?"
2,Esto NO es un CD de Reggaeton.,"Las canciones no estan muy malas, pero el sonido que le da el uso de trompetas y bateria, hace que este CD suene a Rock en español. No suena a Reggeaton en lo absoluto, las voz de el Don suena bien en vivo, pero este CD no es para los fan del reggae boricua."
2,satan's minions in disguise!,"The Reppies is a dangerous television show which could produce horrible demon-children. The way that they follow the Reppies is close to cult-like, and their followers are but mere pawns in their game of global domination. When the Messiah comes to Earth at Armageddon, He will smite the wicked, along with the watchers of this show. The only reason I gave it two stars is because they travel the countryside in a psychedelic bus, a la Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. If you love your children as much as you say you do, then you will forbid them to ever watch this god-awful show."
2,Worked for a little while,I bought this and it worked fine for about 2 months and the projection started to go out.
3,Faulty Alarm,"Every thing on this clock worked great except no sound on the alarm. The icon flashed when it was suppose to alarm you, but no sound. I tried to exchange it for another,but they would not have any in for two months. I returned it and bought another one with the temperature displayed on the projection."
5,Warning: don't listen this album alone,This album is really great. Think about this one for a passion night.
4,Infrared? I don't think so?,"This little heater is awesome, but the only reason I gave it 4/5 is because it was advertised as infrared, which is *supposed* to be invisible light! This is TOTALLY visible light! For my purposes it's no big deal, but if you want this in your room while you're sleeping or something you're not going to be a happy customer. ""Infrared"" is misleading. This is a visible halogen light. Otherwise, excellent product."
3,"Functional, not much more than that","My wife and I purchased this for our living room as a supplemental heating source. Although it worked well for several months, after the 4th month the timer on the unit quit functioning. This means that the unit is essentially an on/off unit. Other than that, it has been fine. It actually works much better in our guest room which now gets quite toasty. Without the timer this unit is not as efficient for use so watch out for those electric bills!"
1,innefective,"It is more a light than a heater . I concur with one of the reviews from another customer , that it is at best a leg warmer .More disturbing is the cost and the hassle to send it back. Absolutely worthless."
5,owner,perfect for my livingroom...heats the area around the sofa and the sofa itself! I was able to turn down the thermistat just in time for our local ppl electric rate hike!
2,Broke,This was a nice heater but the light broke after about a year and a half. It looks pretty difficult to remove and replace. So I'd have to get a whole new one or mess around with halogen lights and tiny screws. With the liklihood of it breaking it should be easier to change the bulb. Timer feature was nice.
1,Windchaser heater,"I purchased my infrared heater three years ago, loved it. Cats and dogs lay in front of it to get themselves warm.Just last week was pet sitting east of Bellevue WA where I lived, Shitzu and cat layer in front of it often.Saturday morning fortunately my cat was on my bed. It exploded the bulb broke, the heater blew flames out, burn my new carpet which was new in June, only five months old. I am in an apartment so having a hard time finding contact information for manufacturer.Scary. Do not buy this product. It catches on fire.Had I been at the mailbox or in the bathroom it would have burned down the entire complex and possibly could have killed my cat and I.I bought mine at ACE Hardware, they are sold at cosco and most stores.Mr. Stacey DriverVancouver WA"
2,Another compilation!,"I hate it when I buy a book expecting a first hand account and get compiled info from historical records. It really makes reading a drag. Not taking away from Mr Vetters service for his country, He has my respect for that. It's just that I don't like reading all the historical records intertwined with statements for people interviewed. I would rather it be broken down to chapters on individual stories."
3,Typical Schurfranz = fickle heroine + Indian stereotypes,"A by-the-numbers teen romance that is slight on history and characterization. The heroine vacillates between the Dutch sailor and the landowner's son from chapter to chapter on the slimmest of pretexts, and the supporting cast of characters are cliches of good, hearty lower class folk and scheming rich guys. Heather's father is another of the recurring ""infantile adult"" characters that pops up through some of the Sunfire books. The resolution with the scheming landowner is trite and forced. Also, there's an appearance by Native Americans in the most stereotypical of terms, which firmly marks it as standard Schurfranz.The shortness of the book (less than 210 pages) is no doubt to blame in large part for the overall cardboard feel, but I can't help but think that it could have been way better."
3,Will not learn Fundamentals by example,"This book was purchased as recommended by the teacher. It is great for general theory and understanding.However this book has most examples showen by instructing you to type on a texas instrumnet financial calculator.So I consider it a bad choice for leaning the fundementals by example.Examples:In the book it tells you to type in sequence of calculator keys on a finacnial calcualtor, so you realy will fail to learn the fundemenatls by example.This book is bad for leaning by example in my opinion and I would not recommended this book if you have another choice.Also, the CD comes with power point slides but no notes, so you cannot review slides and learn in your own time.The same problem with Quiz on CD, you cannot check your answers and review and learn."
1,Not anything like what you see on picture,"When I recieved it, it was nothing like on the picture, meaning that there it is not brown around the neck and the arms which would have given it a cool ""baseball"" look shirt.it's just the print, with a strange ""skin like"" color that don't look good at all.It looks cheap.Dissapointed!!"
4,"Adequate as a primer, not much value beyond that","As a primer on the American federal government in general and the U. S. Congress in particular, this tape is pretty good. It begins with the Declaration of Independence and briefly describes the Articles of Confederation and the flaws within them. It then goes on to the constitutional convention and an outline of the three branches of the government, specifically noting that in the minds of the founding fathers, Congress would be the most significant. The great compromise that led to two houses of Congress is discussed in detail and there is a bit about how Congress has evolved over time.The weakness is of course the brevity of the tape, it is simply not possible to mention a great deal in only 24 minutes. Therefore, if your interest is in an introduction to Congress, then this tape is adequate. If you need anything beyond that it is necessary to look elsewhere."
1,Really?,"That pretty much sums it up, the idea that we should get together and make a movie, with the answer ~ Really?"
2,WILL NOT watch again.,"I rented this, not expecting much. I had 7 movies picked out, and i needed 8 because 8 is my lucky number. lol. But this movie is very Dark. It has a depressing feel, and you cant hardly see some of the scenes due to the Lighting.( Darkness.)"
2,REAL LIFE SPEED AND DOG DAY AFTERNOON,"Documentary, with live tv footage of the crime, about a slum punk kidnapping people in a bus in Brazil.Professional snipers never kill the kid, despite all the chances, cause it all happened on tv, and nobody in charge wanted a killing on live tv!The documentary does drag, though maybe all the information about this case is important.The punk kidnapper was on cocaine---and mentioned how he was influenced by movies.Brazil now---USA as a third world slum a couple decades from now."
3,Great film,"This film is the story of a desperate act and it's protagonist.The story jumps between the dramatic kidnapping of a line bus in Rio and the past of the perpetrator Sandro. Avoiding moral judgments the filmmaker finds the right angle to open our eyes on a dramatic reality we often tend to thrust aside or romanticize. While the stock footage and some shots (the intro is one of the longest and most incredible helicopter shots ever) visually perfectly stick together, the interviews sections in between feel a little poor. Great film though!"
1,It may be a great TV but .....,"I placed an order that was accepted by Butterfly Photo. A week leater I got an e-mail saying they wanted to substitute a ""better"" model, LNT4065F. I checked the Internet and found I could buy the ""better"" model 4065F at a price more than $200 less than my original price for the LNS4096D.Ed Cerne"
5,A+++++ Good Product. . .Good Price. . .,"Hello,the product i bought from amazon is amazing.It is in good condition and does the job.Amazing price.This was the best price i could ever have.Regards,Dimitris"
4,Major character biography + hardcover edition=winner.,"When pocket books combines a marqee character name and a hardcover publishing, you know they have checked the story over very carefully.The only problem with this novel about ""Sarek"", is that it actually should be titles ""Farewell Amanda"" because it focuses on the end of Spock's mother.Certainly worth the paperback price."
2,Maybe it's true -- you can't go home again,"This review is of the Audible unabridged version:I've been a ST fan since TOS ... and still am (except for the latest round of 'dark' movies). I used to read every ST book as soon as it was released. This is the first one I've read in years and maybe it's just a case of not being able to go back again. Frankly, I thought the writing was amateurish -- almost on a class with a fanzine. The overly emotional narration was a further drawback for me.I'm definitely in the minority here, but I just couldn't get into this book and when Amanda started waxing nostalgic over her moon-struck romance with Sarek, I had to stop and move on to a different book.Hope you like it better than I did!"
3,"OK, but not great.",Not terribly exciting. Not much insight into the characters compared to what I expected from the description. It was an OK plane read.
5,Excellent,"I bought this as a paperback many years ago and could never bring myself to read it. I hate to read when favored characters die. I lost the paperback in a move but still had the book on my ""to be read"" list. Having received the Kindle for Christmas, I'm not entirely sure what prompted me to pick this book as the first to read (I think I was influenced by a late night ST:TNG episode).This was an excellent book. It's the first book I've read in a long time that had made me cry. Crispin captures Amanda so perfectly both in her character and through her journal entries. The plot of the novel is good; the characterization of Amanda is better. It makes the novel."
4,Excellent development of one of Star Trek's most beloved recurring characters,"This was a very engaging story. Crispin did an excellent job of bringing further development to the character of Sarek, creating a character that was both in keeping with the existing Star Trek character, yet also more complex. The story moved along at a good pace and was both engaging and entertaining."
5,Best of the best,"I have, over the years, purchased and read over 40 Star Trek paperbacks. This one was worth going back and finding the hardcover for my library. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because I can't give it six. The title should have been ""Amanda"". Anything else would start giving it away."
5,A Review of the Star Trek Book Sarek,"I have read over 150 Star Trek books and this one is my favorite. It is full of fun and adventure. It delves deep into the character of Sarek and the difficulties he faces. A side plot goes into the character of Peter Kirk, Captain Kirk's nephew. This is a very humorous book and is written in the spirit of Star Trek. A must read for Star Trek book fans!"
2,Distracting Melody,"I own a number of Dr. Thompson's CDs. Recently I purchased Unwind, Breathe, and Thunderstorm. Thunderstorm is wonderful---soothing, realistic. But Unwind has melody tracks, thus my 2-star rating. For me, this is not only distracting, but I tire of listening to a melody over and over. If that doesn't bother you, the quality of the CDs is excellent. I've yet to come across one of these that isn't."
2,Not my style,"I usually find Thompson's CD's great for meditation. This one didn't do the trick. I just couldn't get into the music. However, I did find another CD, Breathe, much better simply because I enjoyed the music and don't mind listening to it over and over."
3,If you like it soft...,"This loops disk takes a great idea--world-music flavored hip-hop cuts--and doesn't quite do enough with it. The instrumentation, including boatloads of Asian riffs, is right on. But the rhythm hooks are a little flat, so to speak, and the result just isn't hard core enough for me."
3,Flawed but fascinating,"Well-organized and exceedingly well-researched, my only concerns with this book lie in the way Prof. Snell's sense of majesterial objectivity drop as soon as the subject of Israel arises. He is willing to accept many matters of the early bible as historical, even as he acknowledges it as essentially an article of faith. This certainly gives creedence to the author's religious sensibilities, but it detracts from his overall argument. If the myth records of other nations are not to be considered as the subject for history, neither should that of Judeo-Christianity; if the bible is a repository of historical fact worthy of inclusion in a book that weighs the evidence from more than a hundred works on the subject-at-hand, then the religious documents of Mesopotamia and Egypt such receive just as much regard."
3,Review of Snell's Life in the Ancient Near East,"There's great writing here, to be sure. However, Snell's introduction to the middle east is too wide reaching for 140 pages. He tries to touch on every ancient culture, and therein the book looses its focus. This is feels like a disordered patchwork of several great books on ancient culture. It doesn't have the focus of some better histories--try van der Mieroop.However, I will add that the essay in the appendix, on theories of ancient economy, is a great read. If you find this book at the library, check it out and give this short essay a read."
4,Great,"This was the first song i ever heard by this duo, and it convinced me that they were an act to look out for. Turin Brakes have produced a fine song which combines likeable vocals and strong lyrics to great effect. Unlike many ""alternative"" songs, this is also quite catchy, without resorting to the old, dull, and deliberately poppy elements of other bands in their genre. A fine, very listenable song."
5,My Favorite Coffee Table Book,"Fabulous retrospective of Maxfield Parrish's finest work. The illustrations are superb. This book is expensive, but worth the money. If you're looking for a price guide, I suggest Erwin Flack's book. -- James Halperin, sf novelist and Parrish fanatic."
3,Spoiled Brat,"I didn't like this book at first. Barbara was such a spoiled brat that it really made me sick. However, I stayed with it and at the end it really turned into a nice book. Grant it not great but good."
4,A Simple and Colorful ABC Alphabet--Good for the Very Young,"This is a simple book, nothing spectacular, but what it does, it does well. Like most ABC books, it goes through the letters of the alphabet and shows a picture that starts with each letter.I like this version because the drawings are inventive and the colors are bold. It's a great board book for a toddler because the bright colors and clean lines will hold their interest."
1,cover picture?,"Well, I think it's very important to note that the author - Editor is unfamiliar with his subject to the extent that his cover picture is NOT a picture of his subject. This is an actor portraying Groucho Marx. Any fan of Groucho can immediately tell that these are not the contours of the man's face. Sloppy!"
2,Hardly Essential,"This collection of movie dialogue (Only up to A Day at The Races) A few letters (Get The Groucho Letters, instead) and a few of Groucho's essays is haphazardly organized and only good for the new fan who might want to see what all the Groucho fanfare is about. This gets two stars from me only because I think it might get someone to check out the Marx brothers films. If you are familiar with their work this will add nothing new to your Marx collection."
3,Know what you're getting,"An interesting book, but it really doesn't do Groucho justice, in my opinion. The author has picked scenes Groucho acted in, letters he wrote, segments from radio shows, articles he authored, etc. but the book fails to make the reader feel a need to find more (and more is out there). A more thought-out collection would have made you want to find more material of the kind laid out in the chapters of this book, but for some reason I felt the book just didn't do that. If you want to read some of Groucho's letters, get a book that covers that. If you want to read the radio scripts with Chico and Groucho, there's a book on that as well. But this book in and of itself carries very little of note."
2,Not impressed,"Because this book was a reasonable size I expected bigger reproductions. Most of the prints are a mere 3x5"". If I live in the states I would have sent the book back."
5,fantastic value for money,This is really money well spent if you are interested in the topic; there's a original sized picture of each work together with a brief description.
1,This is horrible,"This album is basically the modern day equivalent to Lou Reed's ""Metal Machine Music"". I am shocked by all of the positive reviews here. It's totally unlistenable, it's basically just death metal slowed down to extreme proportions to make it sound ""creepy"". Don't listen to the hype!"
2,Sunn is noise.,"Sunn are an noise band, pure and simple. It is all about the noise and feedback. There is no song structure, there is no melody. Bass drones and the occasional shrieking lasting 20 minutes is a typical song. I really don't understand the cult that has built up around these guys."
2,COOKIE MONSTER IS NOT SCARY!!!!!!!,"I laughed,I cried! no mostly I laughed, I laughed alot. To me this cd was the worst. It started off ok with some noise and wierd samples but when cookie monster started singing that was it. I just cant get into this whole ""black metal"" thing. I like ambient/dark ambient and noise of most kinds, Lustmord's ""heresy"" is one of the best,but this----no way! The drone fuzz bass guitars didnt help either. To me it sounded like some really stoned people playing Black Sabbath REAL slow and going ""this is sooooooo cool"" Kinda along the same line of "" Earth"" endless drones of guitar riffs and feedback. If your into that kinda thing this is for you, just try not to laugh to hard at cookie monster."
5,Bleaker then hell Essential!For anyone into new music!,This could have been called The Black Metal AlbumOf Sunn o)))and thats excatly what it is!sunn o))) with vox from The Brilliant atilla Czishar(mayhem)wrest from xasthurThe combination of sunn's very eerie loud drones with the screaming recorded in a coffin.Is just brilliant and Highly original!If you dont know sunn o))) this takes time...But if you keep playing any Sunn cd..It will hit you one day like a ton of Bricks!sunn o))) are the best band on this planet!!!Why not start with this one..I did!Live they are lifechanging..absolutly essentialTry to get & of the 2xcd packages .;they are expensive but even better!There is the limited black one with a live at rockskilde extra cdwich is the cleanest but real nice!that I heard of sunnthen there is another 2xcd package Black one (2cd)fantasticI would strongly advice to get all sunn 's 2xcd editions!
1,The most boring band in the universe strikes again,"I've given this band 'one more chance' far too many times. It's just one BBBBWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMM after another. Face it, drone is mind-numbingly boring."
5,The following text is from the Preface:,"Most of us yearn to travel, and the preliminary to travel is to choose a place that others, people or books, say is interesting, then find out more about it.This guide is to help you find out more about Haleakala. It is neither a reference book nor a treatise. It sums up what many have studied and observed. It skims over the myths that the mountain itself created in the imagination of old Hawailans. It reflects also the labor and thought of the compiler. Its aim is to satisfy your interest while you are here on the brim, or at some other point. For some of you it may be the start of a deeper curiosity, to be satisfied by further reading elsewhere.Think of this booklet as a chatty companion along the way, and a ready reminder after you have left, of your pleasant experience at Haleakala."
3,Falls into silliness,"An angry Ron Perlman armed with a gun is definitely one of the scariest images Masters of Horror has put on screen thus far, and it was a masterstroke for the series to land him for an episode. Unfortunately ""Pro-Life,"" about a teenage girl seeking an abortion to rid herself of a baby conceived by demonic rape, starts out strong but falls into silliness by the story's end. There's some topical social commentary here about abortion clinics and the pro-life debate, but all that gets tossed out the window the moment the demon in the rubber suit shows up. I don't know how deliberately campy John Carpenter wanted to take the final act, but it's disappointing given the forty minutes of strong buildup prior.Worth a rental to see Ron Perlman's performance, but Pro-Life feels like a missed chance to do something more with the horror genre."
1,Not even funny bad,"This may be THE worst movie I have ever seen. I had expected it to be bad but at least funny...it is not entertaining at all. You know it's a pathetic movie when you keep checking the time to see ""is this piece of crap almost over?""-please don't waste your time or money with this garbage. I have nothing positive to say about this film, and don't want to waste any more time on it."
3,Please enter a title for your review,"above average for the series, and personally i don't like Halloween or have much respect for John Carpenter so take that for what it's worth. this is at least more eventful than any of the previous four episodes of season 2, and aside from a contextless torture scene i have no complaints. from my perspective i don't see that this film actually expresses any stance on the ""abortion issue""."
1,horror expert,"this was by the weakest movie ever,99% of all these masters of horror movies suck.This is the god honest truth,boaring as hell weak special effects to much cg weak, lousey bad tast in my mouth, what ever happent to real special effects,now in days every thing from blood splatter to brains is all digitally added.Lousey ending two thumbs down."
1,Should be 0 out of 5 stars,"This movie is awful in so many ways. The only good acting was by Pearlman, up until he get into the clinic gates, then the writing turn his character into something that no matter how good the actor, it just came off juvenile. People who gave this 4 and 5 stars are either delusional or have not seen his earlier work. Carpenter has graduated to making con art with his films. Im guessing he wrote this is 30 mins for a quick buck. the plot isnt evening worth being described as B movie-esque or mocking or a throw back to. If you have netflix it might be worth watching for a good laugh. The general concept was a good idea but the poor writing and acting made it a lame attempt."
1,Garbage.,"So if you are like me and USED to enjoy John Carpenter, and think Rob Pearlman is pretty great, you know about this movie. I bought this movie and was excited. I mean everything I heard and saw about this should have made it brillant!! A master of horror he may have been, but this installment of the MOH series is a waste of both time and the $7-8 bucks you might pay to buy it used on amazon. I (alas) bought it brand new for $13, and I wish i could return it for my money back the second after I bought it. If anyone wants a copy for free let me know."
3,Pro-Life is a Killer -- So Bad It's Good Halloween Treat!,"John Carpenter's bloody gore-fest involving a girl, Angelique, who is raped by a demon and wants an abortion She happens to run into two people who happen to work at an abortion clinic who happen to have a court order against her father for some vague reason.Yes, the plot is thin, but the blood flows as a doctor gets shot up and tortured and an evil man and his three sons perform blood and mayhem in God's name.I think what made up for the thin plot was the overacting of the players as they confronted each other with their own personal problems, none of which mattered as each got their brains splattered across parking lots.Does blood really churn out like that with a bullet to the jugular? A little too gory for my taste, thus the three star average.So bad it's good Halloween marvel.Better Carpenter Outings:They LivePrince Of DarknessThe Thing (Collector's Edition)Halloween (Divimax 25th Anniversary Edition)"
3,Not Carpenter's best...but still fun.,"This movie was actually pretty fun to watch. It never got boring or repetitive. The story was actually pretty well thought out and unpredictable. However, nothing about this movie really stood out, except the acting. Like withStephen King's Desperationthis is great acting on a sub-par script. If you're looking to kill an hour with a strange, original horror; pick this up. If you are going to nit-pick and expect tons from a short movie with a budget under $2 Million, you will be dissapointed.As a horror fan, this one kept me entertained."
5,A Welcome Return of a Great Classic,"I was delighted to see this in print again. If you have any interest in what the art of ninjutsu is about, this book will give you keen insights and serve as a great teaser to find out if one of hatsumi's students os teaching near you.One of the catchy characteristics of this book is that is is for the most part the transcript of a meeting that Hayes and his wife had with Hatsumi over 12 years ago, back in 1986. Its new conclusion is a modern transcript of a meeting that the three had a year ago.You will especially enjoy this book if you have trained with Hatsumi or his more skilled students. I would also recommend his other books, along with Stephen Hayes' books. Please take the time to look into getting Stephen Turnbull's books on Japanese martial arts. They are very well done and well illustrated!A real gem! Enjoy!"
4,Compelling account,"This was a very compelling account of the Oatman 's journey by wagon from Illinois to the west. The family of nine were attacked by Apaches. All were killed, except a boy and his two sisters. The sisters were enslaved by the Apaches and later sold to the Mohaves. I couldn't set this book down! There are a rather large number of typographical errors-- sad. Yet the story compelled me to read on without slowing down. Someone ought to clean up the typos before selling it on Kindle. Great account of the Arizona territory and well worth reading!"
2,Inaccurate account,"The story is very inaccurate, and was written by a very biased viewpoint. I have read further into the life of Olive Oatman, and while there are many conflicting stories, this one is inaccurate even as far as the tribe who actually captured them. We have to remember that this account was written at a time when all Indians were seen as blood thirsty savages, and the truth was often ""Hollywoodized."""
1,This movie sucks!!!!!!!!!,IF your a fan of Aladdin just stick with the Disney version. I did see this movie. Not impressed totally cheap animation. Not really entertaining at all. Disney's Aladdin is good enough for me. Just horrible telling of a classic story.
1,not the Aladdin I thought it was,"I guess I didn't read the fine print. This is not the disney Aladdin. THis is some knock off that's not as good. In fact, my son, who is 3, tried to watch it...he couldn't get through 10 minutes of it, because he didn't like the movie! It's going straight to the YARD SALE pile! What a waste of money."
1,Totally disappointed,"I was under the impression that this was the original Disney version, which it is not. Completely disappointed and irritated that I wasted my money on this product. It seems I am not the only one who was not aware that this is not the Disney version. That should be printed somewhere. Guess I should have read the reviews more than what I did! Don't waste your money buying this movie."
3,Alladin?,"My daughter bought this movie. Then was confused. The genie is a different color, and it looks like this is not the movie she thought it was."
1,Lame-O,"Lame. Lame. Lame. If you like this version of Aladdin, you must have eaten too much paste as a kid and your tastebuds died long ago.I don't even have to compare it to Disney. You know it's not Disney and I know it's not Disney.This was totally unwatchable all on its own merits."
5,A favorite from my Childhood,"When I was a little kid, my mom bought this Aladdin mistakenly thinking it was the more popular Disney version. To her dismay (and my delight) it was not the Disney Classic. I loved this movie and still do to this day! It is slightly corny and not the quality you would encounter with the other version but it makes for a great family movie on a budget!"
2,NOT original Aladdin movie,Disappointed that this wasn't the original movie. Don't know which one this is but couldn't return it because I waited a month or so before I watched it only to find out it is not the original Aladdin movie. A bit bummed.
3,Secrets of Serotonin,"This is a very informative book, but the diet advice is not as comprehensive as I would have liked."
2,The bonus feature is the only thing of value,"Like the ""Inside Genesis: A Critical Review"" series, this video is a wretched assortment of commentary by folks you probably have never heard of. The only one whose name I knew was Chris Welch (of ""Melody Maker"")... and this is a guy who thinks the best Genesis album is ""Invisible Touch""! They have clips of early Genesis performances, but they are usually only shown for about 30 seconds and then they cut off. However, there is one redeeming thing about this DVD: The entire 30-minute Belgian television concert from March 1972 is included as a bonus feature. This concert is a must-see for any lover of early Genesis. Unless you have access to bootleg material, you probably have never seen this show in its entirety. It's worth checking out. (By the way, this film will probably end up on the Nursery Cryme SACD and boxed set releases, scheduled for late 2008.)"
2,confederate states paper money,I found this little book far too thin in knowledge and information. To be of much use to a serious collector of the notes of the Rebellion.
5,Fathappy is PHAT,"A must buy. Fun music with a hip, funky, care free attitude. The varietal mix of sounds Fathappy delivers will please any mood your in. This one's a keeper."
1,BOOOOOOOOOOORING!!!!!!,"Nancy, Bess and George go on an African safari with a group of Emerson University students. Before leaving, Nancy is asked by a singer to locate her missing brother who was a safari guide. Also, a synthetic spider sapphire is on display in River Heights (apparently it must rival New York or Los Angeles for these types of shows), but the exhibition is troubled by reports the that owner of the synthetic sapphire has stolen the real spider sapphire on which the synthetic one was modelled. In typical fashion, both mysteries which originate on another continent are tied to the exact place in Africa where Nancy is going. If someone can find even the smallest shred of something to enjoy in this book, I wish they would let me know because I couldn't find anything in it that I thought was good. The plot was boring, the writing was bad, the action was...there was no action, even the artwork was terrible. I didn't enjoy this book at all and I can't recommend it to anyone."
3,Financial Crisis,"An interesting journey into the mind of lawyer turned con man Marc Dreier. Dreier explains how he built his legal empire by defrauding investors out of millions of dollars. Clearly a bright lawyer with a sharp mind, Dreier spends much of the documentary trying to justify his actions, which seems bizarre considering the scope of his theft and the lifestyle he was leading up until he was caught. However, his skewed moral compass provides some insight into how warped Wall Street became in the years leading up to the financial crisis. The documentary does a nice job of charting Dreier's demise and using artwork to complement the storytelling. I'd recommend this doc to anyone interested in the world of finance or the Madoff ponzi scheme."
5,Great!,When I first saw the preview for School Rumble. I thought that it would be simply ridiculous and a waste of my time! Boy was I wrong! This has to be one of the funniest Animes I've ever had the pleasure of watching! Great voice acting! Great Storyline! I felt like I was reliving High School all over again!
3,easy listening,"This collection is pleasant enough, though somewhat light for my taste. Listeners who are mad for flutes will probably like these choros, but more variety in the instrumentation would have been nice for the rest of us. If there were such a category as ""bubble-gum choro,"" the cuts on this CD would fall into it."
5,Great idea!,I just started a children's workshop.I immediately ordered the kids yoga mudra poster to create a space for my class. The kids love looking at the children in their mudra positions. It is a great way to encourage children to continue to explore new ideas and positions to help their own personal growth. It is also a great conversation starter with the kids and adults. The photos are beautiful.
1,Give Me A Break!,"Honestly people! I bought this product based on all these glowing reviews but this thing is lame. There's nothing to it. Yes, it is well done visually with the art gallery pictures twirling into a real scene in Charleston but once you're there you can't do anything or go anywhere. Walk around a pond once or twice and you're done. I spent 20 minutes with this thing and I'm done. There's nothing else to do with it. Absolutely no depth to this product. None. Intitially visually appealing, yes but sustained value and usefulness, no way."
1,Messed up my computer,"It ran okay, but when I quit I found it had resized my computer screen and all my icons were messed up. I was afraid to run it a second time. Save your computer, buy a book instead."
3,H.R. Giger,"this is a good book for some one looking to save money on the introduction to the surrealist art of h.r. giger, it has many previously published works from different books like biomechanics and necronomicon but it is a quarter of the size of those books, there are two versions of this book as well a small copy and the larger copy you will find with red on the cover...not all in black. it is also a stripped down version of H.R Giger .com...if i was to recommend a book out of all of the ones available i would say to fifst time buyers... get h.r. gigers biomechanics or one of the necronomicon books(or all of those), if you wont spend that much money or cant i would just get h.r. [...], but if you want this get the red copy its bigger, still the same exact book, just this one is smaller and less money...."
5,Gr8 book for Giger fans,THIIS WAS THE FIRST BOOK I EVER GOT ABOUT Giger . It is definitely a must have for fans of giger or first timers . it has a very eclectic assortment of a lot of gigers artwork.
3,Good but little complicated book,I`d like that this book has all basics that you have to know in accounting. At the same time structure and material in this book are presented in a complicated way.
1,Accounting: Texts and Cases,"it's just paperback not hardcover,it is just for slae in India, Pakistan,Nepal,Bangladesh, Sri Lanka&Bhutan only."
3,"I paid for expedited shipping, but this book came much later.","I paid for expedited shipping, but this book came much later. I ordered other books from different senders, on the same day, but I got them within 2-3 days. This sender was late in sending my book"
5,The book to start learning about accounting,"I had to read this book to prepare for the CMA exams. In college I had already been exposed to the topics covered in this book, but this book served as a very good refresher. All topics regarding accounting are covered.If you want to learn about accounting, buy this book. It will be the best start you can get."
2,CLASS REQUIREMENT,I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE A HARD READ AND NOT INTERESTING. ALSO NOT HELPFUL. THE CLASS WAS FOR A MBA NOT ACCOUNTING.
2,Horrible,This is not a book for a new person entering the accounting world. Maybe a CPA. The cases are very complicated and lead to lots of misunderstanding.
2,book review,"book was in good condition, but delivery took too long. I paid extra for faster shipping and got it slower than i would for regular shipping price"
2,"Thoughtful, but troublesome","This work has a lot to offer by way of (Christian) spiritual help for personal tragedy. And I find it well-written, and honestly thought provoking.But it has a tone - a certain tone, that troubled me from the beginning. I was unable to name it, until near three-fourths of the way through the book, when the author distilled my discomfort for me. Reciting her journal, she says:""It will never be possible for me to answer the question, 'What is the greater tragedy? Douglas Miller Jr.'s murder or Jason Kent's life without parole sentence?""This troubles me greatly, as I have no difficulty discerning the relative societal gravity of those two events.But it was bold of her to write of her painful experiences, and though I may disagree with the perspective, it is worth the read."
2,Interesting book but not for me,"I certainly could sympathize for these parents but one thing I found disturbing was that they could not seem to put themselves in the position of the victim's family. Certainly it was a tragedy for them, but more of a tragedy for the victim of their son's action. I kept waiting for them to make some kind of a gesture to the victim's family but none seem to be made. While I feel for their grief for something their son did that was not their fault, I would have felt more sympathy for them had they made any kind of a step to help the victim's family. I personally felt that would be a move Jesus would have made. They keep hoping their son will walk free and that is something the victim will never be able to do."
5,So close to home,"The phone call in the middle of the night, entering into and becoming educated in the criminal world process, worrying 24/7 about the safety of your first born (only) son, finacially being strapped, traveling to Florida for visitation and wondering how the future will unfold for him and his family, everything was touched on in this book. And everything was brought into perspective with turning to the Lord and having faith. I'm sure this book will be a reference for me during the difficult years to come."
4,When I lay My Isaac Down,Very interesting story and how to get through tough times. Makes you stop and think about tragedies in your own life and how God brings you through them.
3,Trust and obey,"I had expected more from this author. For me, the analogy got lost in the revelation of her personal struggle. I still highly recommend this book as it addresses such an important topic. We can let nothing deter our commitment to trust and follow, especially in our darkest hours. Our Isaacs come in many forms as do the rams in the brush, but God is constant."
3,Difficult read,This book was difficult for me to read because of some of the author's religious beliefs...it is the opposite of what I believe in.
3,Too preachy for me,"I really wanted to like this book but for me it was just way too preachy and too many bible references and highlights. To me it seemed like it went on and on for pages.I must have missed the genre when I downloaded this book as I do not recall any religious references. I usually stay away from those types of books.While this particular book was not for me, my heart did go out to the parents and I could feel their anguish and heartache at what their son did. And what happened to him when he first went into prison - I was literally in tears. What a nightmare for everyone involved!I guess I was looking for more of the story and if there had been a LITTLE bit or sprinkling of religion and bible references it would have been ok, but that was not the case."
5,Life-Changing,When I Lay My Isaac Down: Unshakable Faith in Unthinkable CircumstancesThis book brought me back from a month of severe depression. And it renewed my faith in God. I have shared it with two friends who have absolutely felt as I did about the book. Carol Kent writes about an unspeakable family crisis and her decision to cling to her faith in spite of her grief. I recommend this book heartily to anyone facing a crisis and especially a crsis of faith.
4,When I Lay My Isaac Down: Unshakable Faith in Unthinkable Circumstances,"This book was easy to read in two days. It is great for anyone going through a difficult time in their life caused by outside and uncontrollable circumstances. It is a transparent account of one woman's spiritual, emotional, legal, and social battle with herself and God, trying to make sense of a devastating tragedy. It's about relinquishing control and trusting God in all circumstances. It's about disapointments in life that can never be changed. It is written from a WASP cultural perspective and it offers tender Biblical encouragement that's realistic. The author is effective."
5,Amazing to say the least!,This book is one that I will re-read as many times as I can before I transition. All of the stories shared and in one way or another I was able to relate. I felt like I was in Florida with the Kent family. I will use this book to minister to other people. I will continue to read anything Carol Kent touches. Thank you for being such a blessing!
5,No words to describe,"This book of unimaginable sorrow and grief will meet you where you are at and move you closer to where God wants you to be. You may need to read it twice as there's the interest in the author's story itself and also the need to apply the lessons learned to your own situation. Given the magnitude of what ""Laying your own Isaac Down"" may look like, application may require baby steps so be gentle with yourself. That is my plan."
3,When I lay my Isaac Down WORK BOOK,"Apparently I did not read the description! I wanted the book...got the Study Guide! But FINALLY got the book. It is one of my top 3 all time favs! Now I will use the study guide! I'm sure to make good use of it. Would be great to use both for a bible study. Easy reading...keeps you on the edge of your seat, and has many many verses to refer to. Makes you realize how blessed you are. If you are facing some REAL troubles, this is definately the book to read. If she can stand up to her night mare, you can get thru yours and her advice is well worth the time!! Could save your sanity. A must read!"
5,High Recommendation,"I have appreciated this book so much I have ordered other copies to give to several people. It was recommended to me by someone else; we had both lost a child. While the author's situation was not the same, that is just what is great about this book. It applies in any difficult situation requiring a strengthening of faith. It also gives recommendations and ideas on how others can support someone going through a difficult faith challenge."
5,Transparent Faith,"Carol Kent and her husband have opened their heart of hearts and allowed us to look into every parents' nightmare. Their God proved Himself faithful and the Kent's do the same. You will be stretched and transformed by the honest, human, horrible suffering and encouraged by the God in charge of everything. MUST READ!"
1,Very Disappointing,"If you are looking for a book that tells you how to be a Christian even when circumstances are difficult, then you might enjoy this book. If you are looking for a book that tells about Jason Kent and the crime he committed, then there are better articles out there (I recommend [..] ). I estimate that about 85-90% of this book talks about how to find faith and keep going, or about OTHER people's tragedies. Very little of this book actually focuses on Jason Kent or how his mother handled the events as they happened. In the end, I just felt that slightly deceive. This book felt more like a long sermon rather then a novel on a mom's journey as her son is jailed for murder. Overall, this is not a book that I would read and not one that I would recommend. Just not my ""cup of tea""."
3,GUAGIRL,i thought it was the book that i order thats how excited i was from hearing great reviews about it that when i placed my order i didn't know it was the study guide!
3,Sympathy for the victim?,"Why did God allow Jason to do this? We're shown the Kent's grief, what about the Miller family, or the fiance?"
1,Don't need it,"I bought this book by mistake - thought I was buying the book itself. Don't need the study guide, because the book has plenty of questions."
3,"Not Bad, But.....","This day planner is totally in black and white. There is no photography, just prints and drawings. The paper is thin. The written content is for the most part interesting. For the price, I think photography and color should be included. Nothing can match the beauty of boats under sail, but you won't find that here."
5,very good book,"This is one of three volumes, all three are excellent resources for anyone interested in how families and woman especially survived crossing the United States in wagons."
3,"Pretty in Picture but very fragile, lil sloppy, etc.","This ring looks very pretty and cute in the photo. However this ring has some flaws... 1) ring is very tiny and thin (more than looks in photo), 2) ring is not a true size 6 (so if buy probably should get 1 size up) and 3) Red enamel is a lil sloppy in person (Idk if every copy of ring is like one I got but mine the red did not stay inside the heart. it bleed over to heart edge n side on some hearts). The positives... 1) it's silver, 2)pretty shade of red and 3) If you like hearts this ring is 4 u. So if one is gonna buy just be aware that the ring is very delicate and fragile so you will have to be very careful with it and take very good care of it and want to buy one size up if your fingers are not a small/barely size 6 or big size 5. On a side note I would rate the seller Eve's Addiction MUCH higher than the ring. I give the ring a 3 out of 5 stars and EA 4.8 out of 5 stars."
2,Wish I had not bought,"I don't like this file box. First of all I wouldn't be surprised if the lid breaks off soon. The lid also does not stay up on its own; you have to hold it open with one hand, while trying to file with the other. It also has two latches; other ones that I have only have one and are so much easier to open when you have your hand full. I wish I had not bought this one."
4,"Good File Box, but Damaged in Transit.","I bought this file box while I was traveling in my RV last summer and staying for a bit with family in Nebraska. I needed a sturdy file box to hold my insurance papers, use & care pamphlets, receipts, and travel info.When it arrived, I was pleased to find a good-sized, heavy duty, nice looking plastic file box. I was anxious to start putting my papers in it. Then I noticed one of the latches was broken off and lying in the box.The latches don't stick out when closed, but weren't fastened tightly. The file had been placed in a box that just fit...it didn't have room for packing material...so wasn't protected from bumps.The product was very good...for plastic. But the handling and shipping left a lot to be desired. Because I was on the road, returning it and getting another was a problem. I needed a file box, so I kept it. But Mama wasn't happy."
2,The lid cannot fold back all the way.,"The lid, when you lift it, will immediately fall back down on the box. It would be nice if, when you opened the lid, there was an option to keep it open."
1,Absolute Crap,Do NOT buy this file box. Cheap plastic and the lid will not open properly unless you press the back of the box in while lifting the lid. One arrived cracked and the other broke in the first week.
2,Won't buy another one to replace it.,"If you plan to use this more than once a month get a different one. After a few days of use the latch stopped latching. The handle also came loose so have fun carrying it full of paperwork. Very flimsy, I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,"Decent box, handle is very flimsy, doesn't stay on.","Decent sized box, strong material, made to store a lot, it's just I know when it gets filled with my paperwork that it won't be able to be picked up, as the handle will fly off."
2,shows green not white,Ok so a natural white glo. Is false. It arrived on time but its green wiped the glass etc. And its still greenish looking.
2,Annoying that they cannot pronounce the names correctly,"I knew that the voice actors would be different from the voice actors from previous Tenchi Muyo offerings, so I expected that the characters voices would be different. What I found to be truly annoying is that so many of the characters names were mispronounced, including the name of Sasami, which being the title character is unforgivable."
5,Adama Action Figure,This figurine does justice to the original Battlestar Galactica series. I would recommend this item to others that are Battlestar Galactica fans.
5,Sickness,"Disturbed's awesome debut album. It's absolutely heavenly. If you like music, you should definitely get this."
4,Good supplement,"This is a good supplement. It does take time for the regimen to have benefits on your body. I thought they worked okay and helped me with my allergies. If you don't know quercetin has great benefits for allergy and asthma symptoms. This is the ingredient found in foods like apples and onions. It will be beneficial for relieving chest tightness/clearing up stuffiness/sinus. Give it a try, it will help you."
1,It does not drop and never stay in it's place,"I did not like it. Not the draw that seem totally different from the picture, not the function. It does not stay in place and rolls very bad."
5,Grace under Pressure,"I am only half way through the book. It isvery well written. Sheri Fink has the abilityto use just the right words to convey thetension, anxiety, chaos and trajedy in thesedismal circumstances.The attention to detail, psychological insight,and reserved language, leaves a deep andsorrowful impression of true heroism in aman-made hell.The story of the life and death of these medical heroesand their war patients surpasses journalism andenters biblical tones.Very impressive!Squiggles"
4,Tribute to Andy or Cachao?,"I would agree with the reviewer Marcos, Andy Garcia seems to be producing tributes to himself with these cd's and especially with the bonus DVD in Ahora Si. Having said that, it's a good thing that Cachao had the chance to make these recordings. Ahora Si may be very similar to the Master Sessions and Cuba Linda, but the music is still hot. He will be missed."
5,Chucho El Cubano,"I have been listening to Cachao for years and I have all his music. I think this is his best album to date. Yes, I love Master Sessions I and II, but this album gets the most playing time at my house, my car, and my office. Cachao's rendition of ""Si me pudieras querer"" is just plain beautiful, and ""Una Descarga a Cachao"" gets my wife and me dancing every time. This is a great album of Cuban music, so enjoy it!"
2,Sounds good,This album is good. The music is timeless and it's just as good as all of Cachaos other albums. I also recommend Angel Melendez and the 911 Mambo Orchestra's self titled debut for something a little more refreshing.
4,Timeless Classic,"Pros:Star cast, beautiful music and songs, lots of humor and action, the video and audio quality is quite decent for such an old movieCons:The story is dumbed down relative to the book;The movie consists of 3 parts and is recorded on 2 discs. I expected the second disc to be for the extras, but to my dismay, I had to change the disc in the middle of the second part! I could not believe it!There are some occasional artifacts and pixelation;On the box, it says there is an interview with the film creators, but I could not find it.Conclusion:Absolutely must have! I would rated it 5 stars if not for those problems with the video and the fact that you need to change the disk in the middle of the movie."
5,Biotech's Enron?,"This is one of the kind of books you start reading in the evening, and you don't put down reading it, even if you are reading all night. Scary. Makes you seriously wonder about corporate ethics. The plot is very realistic and very detailed. It must be based on a real and possibly covered-up story. Much worse than the Enron scandal - at least Enron was only about money. If the story is real, this would be a scandal of epic proportions. Egomania and greed with a disregard for human life. If I remember right, a San Diego biotech one paid a hitman to take out a competitor. ""Thin"" may be another story that has not hit the newsdesks (yet). Even if it is pure fiction, ""thin"" is one of the best novel I have read in a very long time. I wonder who owns the movie rights to this one."
2,Good Classic Cover and 1 Good Song.......,"I've heard this CD in another copy that I sold. I bought a brand new copy for saving as a collectible. The only good song is ""Muscles."" The cover and having this CD for its rarity value is better than the music. I luv Miss Ross to death, but I just don't like most of her RCA recordings."
3,For BBR Records - read this,"Dear BBR,I heard that you are planning on remastering and rereleasing Miss Ross's RCA catalogue. If this is true, and many people hope it is, may I suggest the following for bonus tracks?1. Muscles (12"")2. So Close (single remix)3. Fool For Your Love (the unreleased 12"" remix)4. I Am Me (the rare alternate extended mix)5. Ladies' Hot Line (if a demo exists of this)"
2,Bland and boring,"Silk Electric is Diana Ross' 2nd most boring album from her RCA days (the most boring album being the Red Hot album). Muscles is a great song and I'm probably one of the few fans that LOVES Fool For Your Love, a song where Diana tries heavy metal and surprisingly it works (should have been the second single IMO). Still in Love is an OK ballad, but the rest of the album is just a snoozer. The track Turn Me Over is just a stupid interlude telling the listener to turn the record over (from the days you had to flip vinyl and cassettes). So I would say skip this album."
1,"Nice idea, horrible product","My son received this for Christmas. It plays a sound when you put a piece in the puzzle, but the sounds sound nothing like the instruments that are pictured. I think there's only one sound that it plays, and it just adds different distortions for each instrument instead of having a real recording for each one.But even if you don't care what the sounds are, they're annoying, and you don't want your child playing with this while you're around.DO NOT BUY THIS."
2,"cute, but inaccurate","This puzzle looks great and would be wonderful without the batteries. The pictures of instruments are nice but the sounds are awful They pretty much all sound the same, tinny and annoying. My sons love music and I love that they can identify different instruments but this does nothing to help that. In fact, since it makes it seem like a harmonica and a tuba sound the same, it could actually hurt their musical education. I plan on taking the batteries out of this puzzle soon so they can enjoy the pictures."
2,great product if only there was sound,it's a sound puzzle but there was no sound. I gave this as a gift to my 2yo niece. There was no sound because the battery was dead.
2,Poor Sound,"I've seen and heard a few of their other sound puzzles, pet and farm, and they sounded great. I was so excited about this one when I purchased it for Christmas for my niece. What I got was poor sound quality. I should have tested it before hand as it was mocked by the rest of my family for its sound. Next time I'll read the reviews and get a different one. Their other puzzles are amazing, though! This one setback will not keep me from buying their stuff again."
3,Not Accurate Sounds but a Good Puzzle,"This is a great puzzle. The pieces are durable, easy for little hands to handle, and look nice. My only complaint is that the sounds don't reflect the instruments that they're supposed to. They sound very electronic though they are clear. It would also be nice if they all didn't play the same snippet of ""Old MacDonald."" It would be great if they played different songs."
3,once it hits the mouth...it's ruined.,My daughter put the guitar in her mouth and the puzzle just fell apart. I had to put the toy away until later. I'm bummed because now it's ruined. We never put batteries in so I'm not sure about the sound.
2,disappointed,"For a Melissa and Doug product, this one is disappointing. I would not recommend it to a friend. The sounds do not accurately represent the instruments and all it plays is a small part of Old MacDonald."
2,Please take away the sound....,"Without batteries, this is a great toy, but that's not what we paid for. They are all the same song and, except for the drum, don't sound realistic. Not only that, if all the pieces aren't in place then just the turning on of a light sets the sound off.Take my advise. Either by one that doesn't make noise or take out the batteries."
3,old macdonald is one sensitive farmer!,"My daughter recieved this as a gift at about 18 months. She loves puzzles and mastered this one quickly. When each piece is placed into the puzzle, it plays ""Old MacDonald"" in the corresponding instrument sound. There is a magnet sensor which initiates the music. It is however, very sensitive. Sometimes we hear the music going even when all the pieces are in place. I have to keep other puzzles on top of it on my daughter's bookshelf so it will not be exposed to light and start playing on it's own. It's a nice idea for a puzzle, but not our favorite."
2,Sounds are not accurate and really quite annoying,"I am hesitant to give this toy a bad review because I absolutely LOVE Melissa and SOug puzzles and my 2 year old just can't get enough of them. However, this one is just plain annoying. All the instruments play Old MacDonald and they are all done electronically and unfortunately do not sound very much like the instrument they represent. I am a music tecaher and I was overjoyed when I saw this puzzle to help teach my son the sounds of different instruments but it really doesn't accomplish that. Plus it's very loud (well they all are) and my husband and I are about to take the batteries out. AFTER I ordered my friend said she had the same puzzle and found it also to be the most annoying that she hides it from her toddler."
1,Detrimental to a child's music education!,"First, the physical puzzle is fine. Just don't put the batteries in. Unless you want your child to learn to distinguish between bland, non-descript synth patches from a cheap Casio keyboard.How hard could it have been to use an actual recording of the instrument for each piece? This company could easily use a public domain wave file, or better yet, ask some musicians or music educators to contribute a short melody. You wouldn't need access to an expensive recording studio, either. Today a cheap $300 handheld record would do the trick."
1,Do not buy if you value your child's musical education!,"This is another failing sound puzzle by M&D. Their products are normally of good quality and this one like the farm animals is a disgrace. I am not trying to trash them, I just do not want you to be as upset as I was. All sounds were recorded using an organ of sorts and most sound nothing like the pictured instrument. The puzzle itself works out fine without batteries, just be aware that it is indeed a beginners' level puzzle (marked 2+). To their credit, M&D customer service were gracious and offered to send a non-sound playing replacement."
1,You can find something better!,"Do not buy this puzzle! There are so many better ones out there and this is just awful. First of all, as the other reviewers have stated, the instruments do not sound like actual instruments (i would be unable to identify them and I played in an orchestra for years). But the absolute worst thing about it is that it continually goes off at night(unless you keep the battery out) (there is no on-off switch)! I spent over a half an hour in the middle of the night once trying to get it stop going off (and you know, to take the battery out you need a tiny phillips head, which i did not want to get in the middle of the night!) so i stuffed it under the cushions of the sofa! Seriously, don't buy this puzzle!!! (i love wooden puzzles and would never knock one but this is just ridiculous!)"
2,Continuous Noise!,"What a neat concept for a puzzle but poor execution. Each piece when placed plays ""Old MacDonald Had a Farm"" - just that one line. And M&D attempted to make each sound like a piano, a guitar, a drum, but really it's all the same synthesized beeping in varying tones. And... even if you attempt to put the wrong piece in the wrong place, it still plays music. If this was a true learning toy, it wouldn't play music unless it was put int eh correct spot. And... they go off extremely sensitive. If its' not on the shelf straight it will play randomly. But, my daughter LOVES it. So it was a good purchase."
4,Excellent resource,"I just recieved this book today and spent some quality time looking through it. As with most WROX books, the examples are useful, real-world presentations and I was pleasantly surprised to see some screenshots that used Mozilla as well as Internet Explorer, illustrating the truly cross-platform, cross-browser compatibility of the language. Thanks to the WROX team for another outstanding reference, and of course thanks to Rasmus Lerdorf for giving us the best platform-agnostic, HTML-embedded, server-side web scripting language available to date."
5,Great Book for PHP newbies (beginner to intermediate),"I personally found this book a great resource... I created a dynamic page that lists mp3s ( including all info from ID3 tags ) from a flat file database.. and it works great in PHP4 on windows platform... i have never even heard of PHP until two weeks ago, bought this book, read it in two weeks, and learned all i need to know to get a fully functional database going...I am now gonna look at other technology, but recommed this book for anyone who wants to learn PHP.wg"
4,If you are a solid actionscripter....,"....get the Professional book, even if you have limited PHP experience. I thought it would be a good idea to start from scratch even though I had fairly advanced actionscripting abilities...I outgrew this book within a couple of days.Anyway, that's not the fault of the book. It is well written, and intended for someone with no programming experience."
1,Dissapointingly inconsistent book,"The book is out of date as it covers PHP4 before security changes were made. It is also very inconsistant later on, as the various authors seem to believe in very different conventions, for example early on they claim type casting is unnecessary, then in Ch. 10 they use it loads - without any explanation, also in Ch. 10 they start introducing new functions without any explanation of how they work or even what they do (they explain some but not others) and the examples are really tedious due to similarity in some parts. The different authors also type the same commands differently (e.g echo """"; and echo(""""); - again without explanation, and they obviously didn't collaborate enough to ensure consistency.Otherwise an ok introduction to PHP4, but I'm sure there are better guides out these that will be more consistent."
3,"GOOD BOOK, LACKS DETAILS AND EXPLANATION","this book is heavy, its thick and its almost completely useless. well not totally useless, but it does lack alot of details and explanation about how some functions are created and used. there is alot more detail about installing php and mysql than there is about anything else. buy this book for a coaster, not if you want to learn php."
1,Compound Interest & Calculators,"If you want to know all about compound interest and calculators this book is for you. Little real world examples. Do yourself a favor and get PHP Essentials, or at least a book that concentrates on making Web Shopping Sites. The good thing about PHP Essentials is that all lines are commented with reasonably good explainations and it is actually creating something that is useful rather than a compilation of the PHP Manual and stupid clock, finances programs, that have nothing to do with building interactive web sites. Don't buy this book."
3,"Good book, bad examples...","This is a wonderful book. It tought me a lot of what I now know. The only problem is their examples. In some cases, they aren't complete. They tell you to go search for it out of another example they gave, basicly. Also, some of these examples just don't work at all. I copied one straight from the book and it had many errors so I decide to try and just download it from their website. That had the same if not more errors. If you're a person who just likes reading this stuff but doesn't copy examples to test your knowledge, this is the book for you. Otherwise, I wouldn't get it..."
2,Conspicuously dirty,"The strainer is attractive but does not fit my sink corner well. I guess no strainer can fit every sink. The more important problem is that the stainless steel finish is a magnet for dirt and grease and they don't rinse off easily - you have to wipe frequently, preferably with a grease-cutting cleaner, if you want it to look sanitary. This is an annoyance since the whole purpose of the thing is to hold sink scraps and trash neatly. I would have been better off with white plastic even if it didn't last as long -- the much lower price would have made up for that. At least plastic rinses easily. I should have known about this issue since my sink is stainless too, but I trusted the rave reviews. My bad."
3,Endurance In-Sink Corner Basket,It works well for a small sink and saves a lot on drain cleaning. A larger one would be appreciated.
3,too many loose ends,"I am a fanatical TLJ fan so I bought the DVD. I found the story to be broken and the acting to be forced. TLJ is holding himself back trying not to be a stronger character. There are many loose ends, is the murderer caught? Do the lovers get together? What does the accused murderers homosexuality have to do with the story, and does he get off? I think the stories subject matter is very strong but needed to be more focused on temptation and guilt of a wayward priest and less on solving a seemingly simple murderwhich the cop couldn't figure out, but only took the priest and ex-girlfriend 2 scenes to solve. Good to watch if your a TLJ fan but not a very good story overall."
3,Not too shabby,"I found this comp to be a good mix of creative rhythm from around the world. I enjoyed the combination of South Indian sounds mixed with African instruments in certain tracks, my personal favorite being The Tree of Rhythm. Some good tabla and a very pleasant, upbeat mix in general."
5,One of the best modern books written,Sleepwalkers has shaped up to be one of my most favorite books of all time. Broch acutely depicts the dangerous tendency of modern human behavior to become corrupted and blinded by the world around it. His philosophy describes the 20th century completely as it slowly evolves and matures through each of his stories.A must read for anyone interested in modern works.
1,I'm hoping there is more to this book than what I read.,"A member of our bookclub ""assigned"" this book and warned us that it would be difficult. This book was not only difficult, but also boring, futile, and a general waste of my time. The characters were lifeless, the plot was laborious, and the subtle undertones went well below subtle to nonexistent. Hopefully I'm missing the massive psychological symbolism that so many other reviews and well know authors have mentioned, or else I wasted more time than I care to admit. I would stringently discourage anyone to stay away from this book. However, I do hope someone can help me find some sort of redeeming quality in this book."
1,Don't buy this! Crashes and no support!,Don't buy Football Mogul 2007! The version on the disk has a fatal crash bug and the manufacturer no longer supports the product. I learned the hard way. I hope no one else wastes their money on this product (and Amazon should stop selling it).
3,Who mixed this thing?,"For those of us who love George Thorogood live, this album is a downer. It sounds like the guy working the mixing board fell asleep for the first half of the album. George's voice and Hank's sax come blaring through, but where is George's guitar? The best part of Thorogood's music isn't his voice, it's the definitive guitar work that we love. Turn it up! I know that this is the first live album with his new recording company, but I'm sure they could have done better. The tunes are all great. I especially liked ""Half a boy/Half a man,"" and ""I Don't Trust Nobody."" Could have been another great album, except for the poor quality."
3,"George is Thoroughly-good, but...","George must be heard and seen live. His live performances have an intensity that is beyond anything from the studio sessions, but this is his third live album, and too much of the material on this album can be found on either of the others. George has such a huge inventory of tunes, I can't believe he's releasing ANOTHER version of ""Bad to the Bone,"" one of the most overplayed songs in the history of rock. For my money, the definitive live album is his first one, which contains probably the most intense recording of ""The Sky is Cryin'"" ever recorded. Thanks for the great times, Lonesome George, I'll see you when you come back to town, but I think this is the last live album of yours I'm going to buy."
4,George is in fine form here,"Ok, so it's a little too soon for another GT live album, and CMC probably just wanted to cash in on George's past hits. Who cares? This is yet another badass rock-n-roll record from one of the greatest of all time. This live recording is not as sharp as ""Let's Work Together."" It is much more raw, more off-the-cuff, you can tell George is having a great time playing in St. Louis, and maybe he is a little nervous, too. This is a very real record, with masterful production once again by Terry Manning. Highlights are ""Be Bop Grandma,"" ""One Bourbon,"" and ""Move It On Over,"" but there are no lowlights. Consistently high-energy, rockin', slide guitar blues. It just doesn't get any better than this."
3,Too Little Too Soon,"It is too soon for another live cd by George Thorogood. Do we really need another version of One bourbon, one scotch and one beer; Nightlife; Bad to the Bone and Move it on Over? No. The music does pick up on the songs which we haven't heard too many times already, like Half a Boy and Half a Man and Get a Haircut. If you don't already have a live cd by George this is a pretty good one to get. If you have the others, look for it in about a month in the used bins and pick it up for half price."
2,Another high-concept release from CMC International...,"I hate to knock George Thorogood - he's a true rocker and valuable ambassador to the blues, who still puts on a great show. This album just ain't neccessary, though. He's already done two terrific live sets (1986's _Live_ and 1995's _Let's Work Together_), and has two decent compilations out... so why this? Well, to put it bluntly, the label he's with (CMC International) is a classic rock graveyard, whose modus operandi is to sign past-their-peak acts and milk them for endless ""Greatest Hits Live""-type albums, occasionally letting them make a new record (with little or no support). I'm serious - these guys have put out 5(!) different live Styx albums (to one new studio album) in a four-year span. Such musical integrity is difficult to support."
1,Missing sections,Whole pieces of the text are missing from the free Kindle edition (this one:Adventures of Huckleberry Finn). So far I've noticed that Hamlet's soliloquy and the end of chapter 23 are missing.
3,Disappointed,I really wanted to love this book but it was just o.k. Mark Twain is such a talented writer but this book just wasn't for me.
3,On Top My Soapbox,"Huck Finn was a pretty average book. All of the slang was hard to read at times and sometimes it was hard to follow the plot line. The ending was also abrupt and kind of jerked you to a stop. I would not reccomend this book to everyone for the word ""nigger"" shows up quite a few times. As long as you are not offend then I suggest that you do read it."
3,The Troublemaker Huck,"...after reading the back of the page, it seemed like a very adventurous and fun book. (The cover seemed a little boring).The main character in this story is Huckleberry Finn. He has a pretty sad life because he doesn't live with his parents. His father who is abusive beats him up. Although Huckleberry is a troublemaker and a ""bad boy"", I think he has a good heart. He is a wreckless boy who seems to like adventure and likes to observe the world. I also think that he lacks good judgements, but he means well.I do not particularly enjoy this book because it is very long and boring. It uses too many confusing words and it is difficult to understand. Although this story is adventurous, it doesn't meet the needs I required for this book. It took me a very long time to understand what was going on in this book. Also, I don't really like stories that revolves around the 1800's. They don't do any interesting things and the way they talk is so vulgar."
3,Mr. poppers penguins,"Mr.poppers penguins is a very good book. It is very funny. If you were to read this book you would be laughing as hard as you ever have. When I first read the bok I thought it was going to be worse, but it was very funny. I would recomend this book to people 10 and under."
3,Huck Finn,"Huck Finn Starts out great the first fifteen chapters or so are great, but then it starts to get more and more boring as the novel progresses. If your a reader that can just plow through chapters of maninless boring junk punctuated by periods of awesome literature this is the book for you"
1,Font is too small,There is a reason the paperback Dover edition is $3 (green and black line drawing of a steamboat on cover) The font is way too small and the spacing between lines is non existent. Couldn't read more than a chapter without eye strain (and my high school son said the same). Not worth purchasing.
4,Racial Controversy,"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is arguably one of the most significant pieces in American Literature. Twain, in this masterpiece, highlights sensitive issues through the eyes of Huch Finn and Jim who is a run away slave. This controversy has caused many schools to ban this piece from its curriculum and has been reviewed by many as one of the most racist books of its time.Mark Twain cleverly takes us on a run-away adventure and in doing so helps us understand the exceptence of slavery in Missouri in the 1830's. Ironically, Twain depicts American Society through the scope of Hucks care giver Mrs. Watson. Mrs. Watson is religious God seeking lady who illustrates lack of sympathy for the colored race. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an important piece of literature which should be read with an open mind."
2,Incredibly boring...,I did not like this book when I had to read it for a class a few years ago. It's absolutely one of the most boring books I've ever read. It was too long and too drawn out. I've read other books and stories by Twain and they were so much better than this one. I definitely wouldn't recommend this book.
2,This book has a soporific effect.,"I was forced to read this book for an English class, and it was an extrememly dull read. The extremely exasperating dialect of Jim is difficult to understand, and annoying as hell. Twain once again shows his bitter cynicism towards everything, with his pointless satire. The satire is not funny, how people find it funny, I don't know. It is a dull, boring, pointless,(insert negative adjective here) book, and I stand by my position that Twain was an idiot."
2,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Bantam Classics),"Personaly I didn't like the book whatsoever. I don't see what the big deal about the book is. It's considered one of America's best novels but I just don't see that. It's just a story about a stupid kid that runs away and that uses the ""n"" word one too many times.I addition to this i think that the book shows a lot of racism. The ""n"" word was used more than 200 times and it's just stupid that the author had to include all this racism in the book just to get the point across to his audience.Some people that have written reviews here might not be offeded by the racism that this book shows and I am surprised about this. It makes me angry to see that there are people out there saying how good of a book this is when there are serious issues with it."
2,For the kid in you,"If your are one to thoes people who like childish exciment and adventure this book is the one for you. I mean I read Huckleberry Finn in the 6th grade and I liked it. It was exciting and some thing new! I wished that I could be just like Huck, but that was than and this is now. Times have changed I don't need to read about a little boy who run's away form is adopted family, and how he get's stuck on a raft with an Black man (Jim) who belives that he can tell the future from talking to a hair ball. But the adventure is just begining. Huck and Jim float down the river and incounter some pretty strange people, the Duke and the King of England. Both of these men are con-men, theives and not to mention they are just not nice people. If you are someone who likes to be made fun of and constantly told how stupid the human race is than this is the book for you. I give this book a 2 1/2 stars."
2,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: my opinion,"I am in my junior year of high school and am in the midst of reading this novel. I, along with my classmates, am finding it a very hard book to get into. The character Jim's speech is hard to interpret unless you read aloud and by the time you figure out what he is trying to say, you are very bored. I am told this novel is an American classic. Well, I wonder why I should have to read it then, not only am I Canadian, I also have more interest, being a teenager, in the present. I understand the themes residing in this novel and that they are very important issues and I recognize why it's a classic, but I don't understand why high schoolers should be forced to read it, or any other out-dated classic either."
1,"Horrible, absolutely absurd","I dont really like this book because lets face it, it needs some more spice. Throughout the whole book it was just so plain and dull. Maybe this book appealled to other people hundreds of years ago, but not now!"
5,the best american novel ever written,"Okay. I can't believe people are giving this beautiful book negative reviews. American Literature was born with Huck Finn. Before Mark Twain, readers had to suffer through truly boring books written by Hawthorne, Thoreau, and Emerson. Mark Twain showed American authors how to WRITE. Mark Twain is the American Chaucer and our greatest writer. If you don't like Huckberry Finn you should probally stick with Dean Koontz."
3,entertaining,"This book was a pleasure to read, once you pass the first couple of chapters. The dialogue of the character of Jim is hard, but not impossible, to understand. The adventures Huck and Jim have keep the reader on the edge of their seat and laughing the whole time! However, I do not see myself reading this book again within the next couple of years."
3,required book,My 16 year old son was required to read this for school. He found it boring and too antiquated for his liking.
3,Interesting,"The book was interesting, but I only read because my teacher made our whole class read it. But overall it was a pretty good historical-fiction book."
4,Huck Finn,"A great classic, this is the story of Huck Finn and his adventures rafting down the Mississippi with Jim, a runaway slave. Although I enjoyed it this go around, I enjoyed it more as a teenager when I read it the first time. Overall, if you haven't read it, you should!"
5,Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Classic),This is the first time I have read this book and I loved it. There are pages where I just sat laughing out loud. This book takes you back to how life was in the south and you feel like you are on the raft with Jim and Huck. It is so clever how Mark Twain gets you to understand how superstitions as well as their consciouses ruled the way thought and acted.
4,American Adventure,"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn will always be a classic piece of American literature because it embodies an adventure of immense scale. A young teenage boy and an escaped slave travel down the Mississippi River with nothing but a raft and an obscure plan.This novel takes the reader through the pre-Civil War South and exposes the injustices of slavery as well as the South&#65533;s tainted system of honor. Huck meets a upscale Southern family, the Shepherdsons, who have been embattled in a feud for decades. Many are killed, young and old, on both sides and few can even remember exactly how the feud got started to begin with. Huck&#65533;s friend Buck, who is about the same age as Huck, ultimately loses his life for this feud being ingloriously shot in the back.That is but one of the significant themes communicated by this novel. This book is a must read for anyone who loves an old-fashioned American adventure with a good mix of social issues."
5,Literary Analysis of Adventures of Huckle Berry Finn,"My story is the Adventures of Huckle Berry Finn. This story is a very good story. The thing that i mainly like about this book is the adventure that the book gives. Which always keeps you coming back for more. I'll explain some of the main characters and their important traits. Huck is a homeless person, a liar and a theif. Jim is Huck's friendwho is a runaway slave. Aunt Polly Tom's Aunt. Than there are Mary and Douglas, the two widows in the story who are also very abusive toward other people."
3,"an exillerating, moving, compassionate masterpiece.","I like peanuts. They are good. I like salt too. Paint chips are nummy. The book was all right to, once I put salt on it."
4,"This book is a great classic, but not for anyone below 10.","This book has its funny side and its bad side. I am only 11 years old, and I did not enjoy the Southern Accent that every character had, and its foul language, including the n-word, which gets extremely annoying for a 6th grader, who is taught in school not to use bad words, and make fun of fellow classmates."
4,The race card.,"It seems that everybody's initial reaction after reading Huck Finn is to debate if Twain was a racist or not. It's a pity because such a debate takes away from the greatness of the book. Was he a racist? I don't know, I never met the man. History and his own writing would seem to support that he was. Do I think any less of him, despite my opinion that he might have been racist? Not in the least. His racism was born out of a time when racism was the norm and rooted more in fear and culture rather than hate. Perhaps ignorance would be a better term, but I dare not call this man ignorant. I really don't think he was a mean hearted man, but being nice doesn't exclude one for being a racist. Read the book, you may form a different opinion."
3,"well, it was alright.","I give this book three stars because it really didn't interest me too much. Don't get me wrong, I liked it, and I'm glad that i read it, but sometimes it got really boring. I really think everyone should read this book, though, because of it's impact on American society and because it teaches very good lessons. I would definitely recommend it to those who like historical fiction, you will really like this book."
3,IT WAS OKAY,"I think this book did average for me. I wasn't really all into the book because I guess it wasn't my type. I know that's pretty selfish but other than that, the plot and everything else was great. It really is a great book. I love how Huck was always getting himself out of trouble that he started on his own. it was pretty cool how Jim got involved in the situation with the town thinking he killed Huck. I mean that was such a coincidence how Jim ended up at the same hideout as Huck. I didn't like how the book was so descriptive. That's why I thought that some parts were pretty boring because Huck would just talk about the same thing over and over until the readers get a clear picture of what he was trying to describe. This book was really challenging and funny."
4,purchased Huck Finn on 12/08/09,Purchased Audio CD 12/08/09.Was very disappointed did not receive Audio of Huck Finn til after Christmas.
3,ok,"This book interest meh because it has everything that I look for in a book. It has comedy, drama and suspense. It takes us down the Mississippi River, running through trouble and adventures every step of the way. While the main characters, Huck and Jim goes further and further away, they realize that their's more to friendship than their eyes see.Huck and Jim became close friends eventhough society permits it. It talks about the bad thing African-Americans went through. It thought me that it's ok to lie to protect a friend. You have to follow your heart because most of the time, your brains tells you what others want you to do, while your heart tells you want you want to do. I would give this book 3 stars because... eventhough I like the whole book and it's lessons, I find the ending a little bit frustrating. But all in all, it's still an above average book and I would suggest this book to everyone!"
4,Huckleberry Finn,"I thought that this was an exciting book, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventure. Southern dialect is used throughout the entire novel, and it was difficult to understand at first, but once I had read a little ways into it, the language added tremendous reality to the story. This book is about a young boy who runs away from his dad, the town drunk, and is later joined by a slave, Jim, who is running aways at an attempt for freedom. It questions a lot of the values that Americans had when it was written (before the Civil War), and it's message is timeless. It was an awesome book, and you should definitely check it out!"
1,Still havent recieved,"I still have not recieved the book after waiting over a month, i needed it for school and so i am already supposed to be 1/2 way done reading it, but i dont have a book."
2,The adventures of Huck Finn was difficult to follow.,"This book had many subplots within it, and really did not make much sense. It is a book that could have been shortened about 100 pages!"
1,Mark Twain this is not,"It's hard to imagine how anyone could read Mark Twains hillarious satire and social commentary, and so completely miss the point. Kerry Shale will have you absolutely spleeping through passages that would have you in a belly laugh if you were reading it yourself. And his interpretation of Mark Twain's characters is only adds to the boredom. Just because they talk in local dialect, and have predjudices and superstitions, does not mean that they are all ignorant buffoons. Mark Twain is hillarious and some narrators will have you peeing in your pants listening to his books. Pass this one by."
2,Dragged On,"well, reading this book I felt like it was way too long! It was dragged on and on until you got sick of Huck and Jim always escaping and crap. Man, it is a waste of time. I didn't enjoy it. How dumb are the people that they don't find anything suspicious about a slave and little white boy together on a raft. They also fall for some pretty dumb lies!! Don't read it.. unless you have to for a class.. That's what I had to do!"
2,WHERES THE ASPRIN!,"I HATE THIS BOOK! It takes me an hour to get through the first page. Its frustrating to try and read this. It is a great story...very adventurous, but very difficult to read. at least for me..."
1,This book is boring school should not make you read it.,I read this book in 10th grade and it was so boring. I understood it but it was not interesting. I mean what is so wonderful about a crude and disgusting boy who needs a bath and a brain. Though i did find something postitve about it... it can be used against the enemy in a time of war!
1,A worthless classic,"""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" is a tedious, exasperating, and mind-numbing story. This is my first Mark Twain book, and it's surely to be my last, as I was sorely disappointed. While the grammar and dialect are supposed to be written realistically, I found it cumbersome. The adventures changed constantly, and if Twain had written with one adventure in mind, then my attention span would not have diminished. When Tom Sawyer entered the book permanently, I became irritated, because when he arrived, the story became prolonged and trivial. I feel I wasted my time reading this book. I do not recommend."
1,Dragged out and boring!,"I really didn't like this book. Maybe it's because you need an imagination to read it, and mine isn't always there. It just seemed too unrealistic, and I just hated it."
1,Huck Finn - The True Cure for Insomnia.,"This book really sucked ass. Ever have trouble sleeping? Pick up this sad excuse for an adventure novel and you'll be out in 15 minutes tops. Now don't be fooled by my one star rating... I would have given this 0 stars if that was an option. I'm not even going to fully review this book out of fear that I will pass out on my keyboard. Sure, the idea of this book was good, but it's not as though we never knew slavery in the south existed 150 years ago and the book was an amazing eye-opener. Teachers have been drilling that fact into our heads since fifth grade. Ultimately, this book was a massive waste of my time and brain cells."
1,Huck fin,"This book is boring!!!!!! I am three chapters into the book. It is so hard to read, he rambles on so much, it just puts you to sleep in minutes, and the dialect is so weird, it's confusing because we've been taught proper english and we don't talk like that anymore."
4,Great Classic,"This is a great book and deserves the place it has as a literary classic. The audio version was very good with the narrator using very different voices for the various characters so there is no confusion about who is speaking - a weakness with less talented narrators. The reason that I gave this product 4 and not 5 stars was the packaging - which I found to be inadequate - the case is cardboard and each CD comes in a paper envelope - not good for storage over the years, especially if it is used on a consistent basis by multiple persons. But the actual narration was first class and brought the well known book to life."
5,Huck Finn the perfect dremer,"Mark Twain- The Adventures of Huckleberry FinnThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was first published in 1884 . The hero is Huck ,an orphan addopted by the Widdow Douglas.Huck is kiddnapped and imprisoned by his father ., but he manages to run away . On Jackson`s Island he meets Jim , a runaway slave . Together they start a magic expedition on the river Mississippi . Together they experience a lot of happenings , all leading to a stronger friendship between Huck and Jim .Huck learns from Jim the dignity of a real man . Their adventure comes to an end , when Jim is captured . Huck ,toghether with Tom Sawyer , helps Jim to escape . In the end , when "" all ends well "" and when Tom`s aunt Sally decides to adopt Huck he refuses and prefers to heads westward to avoid being "" sivilized"" ."
2,Almost good,"The book is well laid out and organized, but there are around 3 pages missing from Chapter 21. There are a few other occurrences throughout the book where paragraphs are excluded. They are not excluded for any reason that I can see, (censorship, copyright, etc.) they are just missing at random."
5,Matt Mandarino Huck Finn Review,"I really enjoyed this book, it's one of the few that we've read in english class that has intrigued me to keep reading and find out what happens next. I really thought it lived up to it's classic stature and deserves to be hailed as one of the best. I think that it is going overboard to have ever banned this book, and was almost an unintelligent move. In the book Mark Twain shows how rediculous the prejudices and racism was and how a young boy is able to see through it, while the use of the word nigger is simply added for accuracy, not vulgarity."
5,Huck,This was an Excellent story of heroism and courage. Huck was an adventures boy with strong will power. He went on many exciting journeys that thought him grave lessons on life. I think this book is good for young or old and anyone may enjoy the life of HuckleBerry Fin.
4,"An exciting/boring book all wrapped into one!, a must read.!","This book takes a good veiw of racism in the south in the 1800's. It uses a great deal of satire and humor to move the reader along. It is a great stroy of friendship between two unlikly people. The book if filled with adventure, suspense, humor, sadness and more. I would recomend this book to people who enjoy a good classic. One thinks that Mark Twain saw himself in Tom Sawyer, but in his dreams, longed to be Huck Finn."
5,and still,When I was a kid this was one of my favorite books and when going through a stack of hardcovers at the local bookstore I bought it again on impulse. It is still one of the best pieces of literature I have ever read. Even now at 32 I get lost in it and hold it as one of my all time favorite adventure books. I can't wait to re read Tom Sawyer.
5,Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"This book gives a wonderful picture of Huckleberry and Jim's adventures in towns along the Missippi River in the 1800's. Huck is a young boy about 13 years old, who was very poor and abused by his alcoholic father, leading him to run away. He meets up with Jim, a runaway slave, who was about to be sold to another master. Together, Huck and Jim join up with a couple of con artists and have a series of encounters with people in towns they pass. I finished the book with a much better view of how brutal life was then. This book is a good read for children and adults."
2,Wrong book,"I did not receive the correct version of the book I ordered. I wanted the version of Huck Finn that had the original artwork inside to show my students. However, I still can use the book I received--the Dover Thrift Study Edition because of the commentaries and study guide included."
4,AFTER TOM SAWYER,"After reading the book after it was written some 120 years before, I enjoyed the historical concept of the book and how America played out with the bigotry and views of slavery of the times. I found the dialects and the manner of speaking in the 19th Century annoying and hard to follow, but again in historical perspective, it was a good read, slow, probably authentic, sometimes annoying, and overall a good review of Huckleberry and his black friend Jim, floating down the river and experiencing endless adventures. The larger print of this edition was great for an older reader with fading eyes. In many ways, Huckleberry is an obnoxious, rebellious character, and probably nowadays would be on medication and maybe visiting the counselors for some behavior modication. Overall, worth the time and effort to read a Twain classic."
5,Great book,This book has earned the right to be called the great American novel. It is well writen and has a great plot.
5,Exellent Book Elijah Wood does an Amazing Job,"I'm writing this review because I loved this Audio book that I bought on Audible and I was scrolling through it on this amazon page and it was rated lower than what I believe it deserves. The main reason is because two of the other reviews quite frankly sucked. One guy even said that the book was confusing because of the grammar errors. haha wow, he must not understand the context and style that Mark Twain intentionally wrote in. durrr!but ya this is a fantastic book and Elijah Wood does an amazing job as the narrator. One of the reasons he does such a good job is because Wood actually played the role of Huck Finn before in the 1993 Disney movie so he had a lot of experience with portraying the character. but ya really good audio book for Twain's classic novel. that is all."
5,It wasn't meant to be fun. Twain wrote in deadly earnest.,"Beneath the surface innocence of Huck's narrative, this is Twain's darkest and most troubling critique of American society before the Civil War. It's much more truthful and insightful than ""Gone with the Wind"", for example."
2,Tom Sawyer,"Liked the book ok, not ahuge reader but had never read this so thought I would try it. Worth the time."
2,"Decent plot, horrible writing","I read compulsively, so it's not like I'm a young or new reader. This book was hard to read even for a seasoned bibliophile like me. I understand Mark Twain wanted to write it in authentic dialects, but it was just too much. ""To Kill a Mockinbird"" is written in authentic dialect but still remains readable. If I hadn't been reading it with my husband who HAD to read it for class, I would have quickly put it down. I did like the issues the author dealt with (Jim's freedom, Huck's loyalty), but it was basically drowned out by the overly descriptive rants and hard to read communication between the characters."
4,Huck Finn,"In my opinion, this book is awesome just simply because I like adventures. I was delighted to find this rather a unique, fun, very interesting book. This is a book that I highly recommend to older teens and adults. If I could chnage anything in the book, I would just leave it like hhow it is written. As a teenage reader, I found the reading to be addictive. huck and jim's adventures for the most part are quite exciting and fresh, with plot turns that I would not have predicted."
1,"Amazon, where are the reviews for the audio CD?","I object to the reviews presented by Amazon for the CD, ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: A Signature Performance by Elijah Wood."" I could not find a single one. The 700-some reviews were for books. Tell me about the CD audio: Is Woods' accent true? Is his delivery compelling? Is the presentation truly unabridged or are there omissions? inaccuracies? I loved the sound of his reading voice because it seemed boyish, not like an adult actor trying to sound boyish."
3,I gave this rating because of the book itself not for the content,"I loved this book but the actual book itself was all messed up. I don't know if other people had this problem but my chapters were all messed up. It would go from chapter 8 to 9 to 10 to 9 and then to 12. The content was not misplaced just the number was wrong. I don't understand how you could publish a book not double check EVERYTHING! Also, I found some just weird errors like cOme. This isn't a big problem it is just unprofessional and I will not be buying books from this publisher."
3,I think that this novel was difficult at some points.,"I think that Huck Finn was not my favorite novel. At some points in the book I had trouble understanding some of the events. The way Jim talked sometimes confused me. Other times, the book was funny. I enjoyed the part where Huck dressed as a girl and went into the camp. Then a woman figured out that he was a guy. Mark Twain uses humor in his books to keep the readers attention and I think that he could have used more at some points in Huck Finn."
5,Phenomenal.,"This timeless classic is the quintessential American novel. What makes the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn so unusual is that it is no doubt a pleasure to read. The book makes the biggest moral issue America has ever faced its subject matter. Through impeccable character development, symbolism, and satire, Mark Twain tells of not only the coming-of-age of a young boy, but an entire nation. This seminal novel did for literature what the Declaration of Independence did for government. It chooses not to hide behind any pretexts, with its characters speaking in straight-forward language. An unpretentious and unintellectual a novel as you can find, the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn remains at least the greatest American novel ever written."
5,Gotta love the slang,"Reading the slang in this novel sure beats reading the formal English of snobby, dull authors. The vernacular is fun. I don't give a damn about the so-called proper English. If you don't enjoy the language in this text, then go read any 18th or 17th century English text, and tell me which is more entertaining to read. I enjoy watching Twain break the grammar rules we all learned in English class. It is not that he does not know the rules, he just wants to be creative. Breaking the rules for grammar allowed him more space for creativity."
3,Good book with a shabby ending,I enjoyed this book until the end. What are the odds of Huck stumbling on to members of Tom Sawyer's extended family? A brilliant writer like Twain could have come up with something a little more believable than that.
2,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"There were a lot of weird mistakes/typos in the publication. The book was for my high school daughter's summer reading homework. She found the style of language in the book difficult to read, but then when there were all these typos it became really confusing."
1,dull and boring and inconclusive,"This book seemed to continually go on. It never really came to any important lesson or moral in the entire book. The book was extremely vague, nothing really had a reason for happening it just did it was very dissappointing after hearing all the praise that had gone into it."
1,Horrid,"The improper English in this book detracted immensely from the story, making every sentence a chore to read. This book was required reading for my tenth grade English class, and I had to buy the Cliff Notes because I couldn't stand reading one more ""aint""."
1,A Very Big Disappointment,"In my opinion, this book was very boring. I say this because it went at a slow rate. There wasn't any exciting parts for me. It was plain boring but it is worth reading because you understand this person's life. But if you are like me, you'll think it is boring and don't want to read it anymore. But you have to continue and learn something. In my opinion, buy it to learn the person's detailed life, but don't be suprised if it is boring."
1,Wordy and Dull,"Twain has over used words once again. I wish someone would have told him that it's quality, not quantity. Overall, I found that characters I wanted to stay died and characters that I wanted dead stayed, making for a tedious and dull read."
2,One Lousy Escapade,"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain, is a dull book that is kept alive only by its strong moral lesson that contradicts the rights of slavery. Jim, an African-American runaway slave, is on the search for his own freedom by escaping to the south. Shortly into his journey, he phenomenally runs into and befriends Huck, a rambunctious wild child who is also coincidentally running away from home! Although the lesson is important, I found that it clouded Twain in his ability to entertain me as a reader. Insignificant chapters and random characters slowly drag along as Huck defeats all odds in his unrealistic encounters that take place on the Mississippi River. Repeated character personalities and storyline ideas created confusion for me as I was also perplexed by Jim's heavy dialect. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is actually looking for an actual action plot as it is a huge disappointment as a sequel to the thrilling Tom Sawyer novel."
4,great,"It is said that there are two great moments in all of American literature; one occurs in <Moby Dick> when Ishmael joins Queequeg in observing a pagan ritual. The other is found in <Huckleberry Finn> when Huck decides against turning Jim in, even though his soul would rot in hell for it. The point is that Huck really believed that he was going to be damned for helping Jim (which was why the decision was so difficult to make), but was willing to face the consequences anyway.The major letdown of this book is that last part with Tom Sawyer. The book's tone changes suddenly; it becomes almost juvenile. Those last chapters are what's keeping me from giving this book the full five stars.As for the dialects, I had surprisingly little trouble with them even though English is not my first language. A suggestion; if you come across a word you really don't get, try reading it aloud. If that doesn't work, read the whole sentence aloud. You'll be able to deduce what the word is supposed to be."
5,Great!,"This Kindle version of Huckleberry Finn is great. It is not abridged, which is excellent, as it retains all of Mark Twain's original writing. If you wish, you can navigate using individual chapters. Very successful Kindle version. (And if you've never read this before, it's a really wonderful story.)"
5,Greatest book I've ever read,This is not only Mark Twain's best book but it's by far my favorite book of all time. I recently reread Adventures of Huckleberry Finn as well as Tom Sawyer and Puddin' Head Wilson and neither book even compares to Huckleberry Finn. Its hilarious at times and deeply emotional at others. I would recommend to almost anyone.
4,It's Mark Twain's best,"Others have written more eloquently in greater quantity than I can produce. It's Huck Finn. Read it.Note that this is the written in the vernacular of the American South in the 1800s. If you cannot accept a story told using words that have different meanings today, you should skip it and miss the mastery of the first three quarters of this book."
5,Huckleberry Finn,"There are certain books that everybody should read in his/her early life. Nevertheless, this is not exactly the case with this one. It could be read throughout without getting bored at all. Even if seen to be a bit quaint nowadays, the adventures of this little hero are so adorable and thrilling.Furthermore, I welcome the idea of publishing the great book bit by bit, thus making it more digestible. Why not indeed, bearing in mind today's prevalent trend of scanning and skim reading due to the chrnic lack of time.This enjoyable read could even grant some relaxation and peace of mind to all modern people that are so stressed out lately."
4,Mixed feelings,"I had delayed many years with this book at the top ofmy ""gotta read it"" list. I know it is a highly reviered classicand I'm not sure why. Is it because of the time it waspublished? Beats me, just know I was left somewhatmystified at its reputation."
4,It's Mark Twain Say No More!,"This timeless classic by Mark Twain should be a must read for everyone. I am so happy to know that most schools you have to read this for at least one class before you graduate high school...This should be a bedtime story for younger ages above the age of 8 and a book that all adults and children should read over and over again!As always Mark Twain writes in pen how the people talk and gives you such a mental picture of their surroundings and as you read you can actually feel their emotions in your head,heart,stomach, and soul!I won't however tell you any of the plot, it is far too interesting and you have to read (see) it for yourself!"
4,this is a great book,"I read this story for my tenth grade English class and it was great. the story will make you laugh, cry and smile. it has a great portrayal of the deep south before the Civil War. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it was sometimes hard to follow, but other than that, it was great"
3,Dick Hill Book on Tape edition,"I ordered this so I wouldn't have to read the entire book aloud to my class, and they wouldn't have to read it aloud either. You have to have a balance control on your tape player, or no dice. I don't have a balance control, so I had to unplug first the left and then the right speaker to listen to this. That's the only way they could get the entire novel onto four tapes! Mr. Hill reads a lot slower than I do, for effect I guess, so we won't listen to this much. Maybe just when I am sick of reading aloud! But it is nice to have so when I need a substitute, he or she can just pop the tape in and not have to worry about covering the reading for that day."
3,Quality of Book is Terrible,"Let me start by saying I am no literary buff and a literary review by me would be unhelpful towards your purchase. While this novel is great, the quality of this particular version of the novel (Puffin Classics) is quite awful. After reading the copy a single time, at least 100 pages came loose from the flimsy glue binding. This is a great read, and I recommend purchasing a different version of the novel, even if it is a dollar or two more, just so you don't have a collection of pages scattered all over the place."
3,Adventures of Huchleberry Finn,I liked this book a lot. Huck's adventures are way cool and it was kind of hard to keep track of them all. My favorite adventure is when he and Jim befriend the two aristocats and and they have that plan to steel the Wilkes' money. it is funny when they come back and they don't get the money anyway.Thet was really cool how Tom's aunt and uncle were able to trick Tom and Huck while the two friends were thinking that they were actually fooling them. The reason i liked this book the most was i loved how loyal Huck was to Jim. I can see why he struggled with keeping him a secret and i would also be tempted to turn him in at times. i also loved how Tom was so whilling to help his best friend that he hadn't seen for so long. Overall i loved this book a lot and it definatly taught me a whole lot about loyalty to me friends. I think that i will alwyas remember this book for a long time.
4,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"THE ADVENTURE'S OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN, by Mark Twain is an exciting classic about a boy and his strange ambition for never-ending adventure. His only companion, a run-away slave named Jim has been his partner in ""crime"" as they both run away from society. This novel took place in the crucial times of the late 18 century where slavery was an unjust method of deception. Jim's struggle for freedom and Huck's struggle for adventure take both of them through non-stop ventures."
4,huckleberry finn review from 18 year old eyes,A very exciting edge of your seat novel filled with adventures that really touch home. imangine being a run-away slave trying to get to freedom and your only companion is a white boy that could turn you in at any time. you are sold for $40 to live in a small prison shack until you are claimed. try being a small white boy is who hidding a slave and knowing all the time that at any minute you could be hung for keeping your secrets. these are just some of the amazing adventures you will find in this book!
4,It was alright...,"Huck Finn was a very interesting book, which had a lot of facts in it, from which I learned from. Additionally it kept me in suspense and I recomend you read this book."
2,Missing pages,"The original writing was wonderful and Twain, of course, deserves 5 stars. However the edition I received, which was printed by Oxford World Classics, was missing pages 123-154. Luckily, I could go on line and actually read those pages (chapters 21 through 25) but that did not make up for the hole in the book that is now part of my library. Very disappointing! This is a classic I had hoped to pass on to the younger members of my family.I rated this edition 2 stars (rather than 1 star) because it did include Twain's ""The Raftsmen's Passage"" in an appendix as a bonus."
2,Disappointing,"I must say, I read Huckleberry Finn the first time when I was too young. However, this summer, it was on my summer reading list, so I started it once again. For the first half, I enjoyed it immensely- it was exciting, well written and interesting. However, this book seems like it goes on forever- and it stays the same, for me, after I'd read the first half, the second half was very similar- and by the end, I was very ready for the book to be finished."
2,Icky,"As adventures go, Huck does experience a lot. But it is hard to keep up with them while you are sleeping in your chair. I never got into this book, I can sum it up in two words: ""Unbelievably Dull"" Of the many experiences he does go through, none of them are exciting. It looks as if Mark Twain took many small meaningless stories into one big one. Please...read anything else."
2,Classic Boredom At Its Best,"When I first picked up the book to read for my tenth grade English class, I thought to myself, ""Hey, it's a Twain book! I'm sure it'll be great!"" Boy, was I wrong! Historically speaking, the book was accurate with its use of racial slurs, societal views, etc. Twain's colorful use of dialect was interesting, albeit difficult to sift through at times. Also, Twain's vivid descriptions absorbed me into the book and made my feel as if I were sitting next to Huck and Jim on their raft. However, those factors definitely did not make up for the boredom experienced as I read the book. The characters were bland and unappealing, the plot was absurd and dull, and the hefty symbolism was annoying.Sure, ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" is a literary classic. That doesn't mean that it's great. For the modern readers of today, this is boredom-inducing material."
4,BOYZ WILL BE BOYZ,I READ THIS BOOK IN MY FRESHMAN YEAR OF HIGHSCHOOL WITH MY LANGUAGE ARTS CLASS. AT FIRST TO BE HONEST I THOUGHT IT WAS BORING BUT THEN I REALLY GOT INTO IT. I GOT TO KNOW THE CHARACTERS AND I ENJOYED READING IT AND TAKING TESTS AND QUIZZES OVER EACH CHAPTER. MY FAVORITE TWO CHARACTERS WERE TOM AND HUCK.....I FEEL CONNECTED TO THIS BOOK LIKE I WAS THE MAIN CHARACTER OR SOMETHING. THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK! THANX!
3,The most contriversal book of our time.,"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was written Samuel Cleamins a.k.a: Mark Twain. This a book about Huck Fin and Jim (a run away slave) travel down the Mississippi River trying to escape up to the northern states.This book is the most controversial book of our time. It has been banned in some schools for being racist. It does have a racist tone, but it is also one of the best books of our time as well. This is like an American Shakespeare.I would read this book, but if you find the ""N word"" very inappropriate I advise younger children not to read this."
2,"The ""Great American Novel"" my arse...","Well, if this was ever the biggest disappointment. I read this last year, not by choice, nearly failed the final test (as did the enire class, and I get straight As)...I may have enjoyed this more had I not been forced by demonic Junior English teachers who have no idea how to teach. I thought the novel was boring, strung-out, and relatively meaningless. The plot was muffled, tiring, and nothing but go here, flee there. The only character I enjoyed was Jim. He had the ""you gotta love him""-esque sort of aura. Anyway, my two cents...BTC""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is essential to the understanding of the American soul"" said in the brief amazon.com review. That's a crock. This book was tremendously boring."
1,Even if its a classic that doesn't make it good.,I had to read this book for summer reading and it was complete torture. It was the first story in America to be done in venecular which made it a classic and hard to read. some how his adventures are nothing but dull are semi-stupid. Huck is not a perfect character and all his flaws seem to be over looked. Jim is merely in the story because he needs to be and although he is not a brilliant person mark twain has not given the slave fair credit by making an unschooled boy half his age seem twice as smart. His story also implied that southerns are stupid just by the way they talk amoung other things. The story ends leaving you unsatisfied with what you that the main character should have learned. Not worth the read unless you want to say that you've read it.
1,"boring, no point, rambling on",the dumbest book i have ever read i feel it is a waste of time and i would not read it ever again
1,The mediocre adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"This is another deemed classic book that should've never made it as far as it is today. The basic scheme of the book is Huck runs away with a slave and they pretty much do nothing exciting the entire book with a dumb ending. It reminds me of most classics. I don't see why the book is called racist (it was written long before the Civil Rights movement), but I do see why many people think this book sucks."
2,Good for young readers but not for adults,"Reading about two obnoxious bums who call themselves The Duke and The King abusing two innocent and naive people is no fun for me. Finding out that a thoughtless brat, Tom Sawyer, put people's lives in danger for his own stupid amusement doesn't amuse me. I realize that Mark Twain is considered one of young America's finest writers and that this book is considered his masterpiece but I don't like it. My thirteen year old child likes it a lot."
1,Oy vey...,"Okay, I didn't really care for this book. It seemed dull and pointless, not to mention the plot was very vague. From what I could understand, it just seemed totally random. Not to mention it's hard to understand!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"After reading and enjoying The Adventures of Tom Saywer, I was looking foward to being able to read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn in my English class. However, I hadn't read much of it before I realized that it was going to be something to suffer through, not enjoy.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was an extremely plotless, racist book relating the adventures of the rather tedious, annoying character of Huck Finn. Huck had recently left his hometown and went rafting down the MIssissippi with a slave, Jim. Huck is forever lying to and leaving Jim, in a fashion that made me wonder if he had ADD. The end of the novel, which had potential to make it better, made me hurl the book across the room, in a way certian to make any librarian weep.I also found the dialects that Clemmins used extremely annoying. I had to sound out the words to myself to see what he was trying to relate.If you want to read a book, any book, pick something, anything, else. Trust me on this one."
4,Great Books!,I bought this book for my kid's school reading assignment and my kid like it very much.Bought used but the quality is pretty good!
3,Endless,"The book is good, well written, and usually chuckle-worthy. However, there are points when it seems endless, like they are never going to get out of the river--a lot of the stories hard seem like unimportant side-tracks..."
5,Kindle version was pretty well formatted,"I bought this for my IPad Kindle app and it worked well. I hadn't read it in a very long time and forgot how harsh of a book it is. Just part of the time, but interesting nonetheless."
4,School book,"A classic. What more can you say? Except, Twain was an excellent writer and his messages are still so powerful today."
4,A forced read...but ag reat one,"A set text in Yr 11 English, this book has become a favourite of mine. A grand adventure, with some great observations of society -- and people in general."
5,Great deal,What a great deal-- completely free for a classic book. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a powerful yet fun book.
4,Thought provoking,"Lots to think about, I liked it, but sometimes it was hard to get the meaning behind which was the better parts. Interesting to see how life was, if you didn't grow up being taught that way. Makes you watch what is being taught to you and not to believe everything. Society can be wrong, life is a mixture of grays not black and white."
5,American Classic,"This book is undoubtedly the icon of American Literature. It's about an innocent orphan's journey with an escaped slave named Jim along the Mississippi River. The elements of prejudice, loyalty, friendship, and moral values are all present. It is definitely a must-read for any American, and anyone who speaks English!"
4,Classic 'ole tale that's important for Americans to read,"I first read Huck Finn in Junior High school, and remembering how I'd liked it so much from the first reading, decided to go over it again. And, I liked it just as much. Huck & Jim stealthly ride down the Mississippi, discovering and creating their own adventures from the places and people they come across. Lot of points were noted in this book, and I liked the way it was written. Although this story and it's characters are genuinely different, At times, Huck, Jim and the others, reminded me of Moriarty and Kerouac. They went on a journey ""On the River"" before their was a road."
4,Better than Tom Sawyer,I enjoyed this book more than Tom Sawyer because it seemed to flow better and was more interesting. I agree with another reviewer who pointed out how the story seemed to stall after Tom enters the scene. It is still worth reading and as entertaining as Tom Sawyer.
4,Huck Finn's Independence,"This is the second time that I have read the book and it was just as good as the first time through. I love the witty dialect Twain throws in to create a southern ambiance of the 19th century. This book was a huge piece of controversy at its time due to the fact a young white boy and a run a way slave team up to sail the Mississippi in seek of adventure. I find the book really interesting and at the same time almost weird, kind of on a Sci-Fi level, with everything involving how the two families kill each other including their children. Today's world is full of people trapped in the routine of society's standards and Huck is a perfect example of what many people want - independence and free spirit. I like how Huck, even though without a proper family oriented upbringing, is able to distinguish from right and wrong. It shows the incredible mental capacity humans have in their ability to reason."
4,hmmm..,"Mark twain did an amazing job at making the characters come alive. Although the book is over 100 years old i was still able to laugh at the jokes and some of the situations are still relavent today (for example the whole predicament with Pap). Though the dialects used in the book were essential to the characters and the story I sometimes found them to be either annoying or downright confusing. Nevertheless, this book still deserves 4 stars and will surely stand the test of time(well...it already has but will continue to do so)"
4,The advenger of Huckleberry Finn,Huckleberry Finn was a story about a boy who was an orfan. He lived with a widow and his father was not very nice to him .One day he snuck out of his house and ran away andfound a firend. I thought this was a good book.
3,Very Good Book,"Some may find The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn to be racist, but I do not. I think it gives an outlook on the way it used to be back in the time when the idea of free slaves was a new thing to America. It tells the story of a little boy and a runaway slave running away and trying to make it on their own. Striving for the American dream, there destianation is to the free states. Traveling down a river, they encounter many obstacles. It has a very good ending and is a very good book."
5,Great CD for Louise,"This LP was produced by then husband RC Bannon. RC also wrote or co-wrote some of the songs on this LP/CD.Louise was one of the first artist that RCA released CD for (over seas) ""Too hot to sleep"" was the first CD for her in 1983.These songs were so good for Louise and she put the Mandrell touch on each of them. Maybe my baby was the biggest hit from this collection reaching the top 5.If you can find a copy out there good luck."
5,in the night sky over Florida,"Found this book at the library and loved it. I ordered my own copy so that my Florida guests could enjoy and learn about our unique and lovely place in the cosmos. After vacationing here for 17 years and always looking for the fabled ""Green Flash"", I finally recognized one. Thanks to a picture in this book I knew what to look for."
3,Mislead...,"I liked this book. I thought it was going to be mostly about the Godfather, but to my surprise it was like 2/3 about writing and acting, and the last third was specifically about the Godfather. My only disappointment was the lack of Sicilian language in the book. Even the Sicilian proverbs were only in English. Siddu 'un si linguista, e preferici tuttu ni lu Ngrisi, t'a fari piaciri stu libbru puru senza nuddu Sicilianu ni iddu. I still liked the book without the Sicilian, and even though it was more about acting and writing. And if you get down to brass tacks, there wasn't much Sicilian in the Godfather movie. It wasn't really used that much until the Godfather II. Heck, if I ever decide to try acting or to write a screenplay, this book may actually come in handy, lol."
5,Thought Provoking Yet Readable,"McGee's predictions, while some may seem infeasible, are thought provoking and founded on ample research in today's biotechnology market.As a student taking AP Biology, I found this book to be wholly readable; it touched on topics I've had to study, but no where did it become tedious or perplexing."
3,Good Tools But Cheaper At Home Depot,"I've had my 18Volt set for almost 2 years and haven't had any major problems with anything. We've remodelled a house, and used the drill and saw on many daily projects. Only 1 issue was one of the batteries might not be charging all the way but I'm going to see if it works better now after I tried to drain it all the way before charging. Normally these batteries are suppose to be recharged right away even if you barely use the tool. Not like the old style batteries that you use to HAVE to drain completely each and every time because of thier memory.Do yourself a favor though and go to Home Depot to buy this item. Prices are much better and replacement batteries are only $20!!! Father's Day is the best time of all for discounts on tools!"
2,You can get this combo at home depot,"for the same price, but the ones at home depot are new and not reconditioned.I didnt know about home depot soon enough, so the speed selector on my drill came broken."
1,Maybe for a homeowner,"Was given this set to use when I was driving a service truck. They are very lightweight, but not powerful enough for hard use. I think it's about comparable to 12 and 14.4 volt tools from higher end companies like Dewalt, Milwaukee, Bosch, Panasonic, Makita and even Ridgid. Batteries do not hold a charge for long, did not like the cold and needed replacement within the first year - and yes I know how to use and charge Ni-Cad batteries. I have NOT had any of the same issues with my Milwaukee, Bosch, Dewalt or Ridgid tools.If price is the only factor, sure I think this set might outperform Black and Decker, Skil and other such brands, but if you really want power and utility - stay away."
5,Great deal,"Arrived on time with a bag of goodies, I am very satisfied and keep finding new uses for the tools. Found the reciprocating saw perfect for ridding my property of thorned wild trees, without eating my arms."
2,BEWARE,"No blades were supplied for the saw - customer service response was as follows;""Since the item is considered a reconditioned so the blades areconsidered an accessory. Our company does not gurantee any blades tobe sent with the item. (another supplier) does the reconditoning so we do not know what parts are put into the boxes.""Tools do look good but are heat stamped ""RECON""..."
2,Second Chorus,This was not the type of Fred Astaire musical I'm used to. It was very disappointing and of poor quality. Royal Wedding was a great movie. I would give it a five.
2,Toaster oven cookbook,Did not care for the book.For one thing I like cookbooks with pictures I do use it now and then for reference.
5,good size,"Good cookbook, but really liked the size of it, can easily put this in a larger purse, great price, gave this as a present...they loved the recipes"
4,Great book,I liked the variety of recipes presented. The serving sizes make this a great book for small families or couples.
2,Pop it in the Toaster Oven cook book,"Not very useful, boring read, could use pics of recipes to jazz it up a bit - boring recipes, nothing that is not obvious for a toaster oven."
1,Silly worthless book of the obvious,"I bought my first toaster oven, figuring that I needed to learn the basics. Lots of people who bought the Cuisinart oven bought this book.It didn't tell me anything I didn't know about the device, and was mostly inane recipes combining ingredients that would occur to any modestly talented pre-teen junior chef.Possibly the worst cookbook I've ever read; certainly -- by far -- the worst I ever purchased. I can't imagine this would be of use to 1 in 20 people."
5,The Best,"This is the best toaster oven I have ever seen. It actually perfroms as advertised. I would recommend it highly to anyone that wants an excellent toaster oven. Just remember there are a lot of less expensive models out there, but you get what you pay for."
4,great recipes,"I have found this book to have tremendous recipes, and most are low fat. Everything I have tried works to perfection. My only complaint, is the pan sizes are not real. Like many recipes call for an 81/2x81/2x4 one quart dish. There is no such dish."
1,Weirdly obsessed with eliminating fat,"This maybe should have been advertised as a Susan Powder-esque eliminate all traces of fat from your diet cookbook. Squeezing your cooked dinner between paper towels to eliminate all vestiges of fat?!? Really?!? Every recipe with dairy uses non-fat yogurt and fat free half and half instead of whatever dairy product would ordinarily be used, and EVERY recipe lectures on all the ways you can take out every last smidge of fat. The author comes across as having an eating disorder, and the recipes are weird as a result. Some of them I can't even imagine working (for example, making split pea soup with split peas that you grind to a powder in your blender and bake with no liquid at all for an hour!). I bought this book because I'm currently without an oven and am committed to cooking fresh, from scratch food, and was looking for some ideas to stretch out from what I've been making in my toaster oven so far. I can't honestly see making any of these recipes."
2,Uninspired,"I made several of the recipe's and they were mediocre to disasterous. The lasagne was swimming in water and I ended up throwing it out. The recipe's are for families of 4 to 6 people, so if you are looking for a cookbook for 1 or 2 people, buy a different book."
2,Not as good as the manga.,"The first season boxset followed the manga very closely and what it did add was well done. This set of episodes diverges from the manga almost entirely, which wouldn't be a problem if the added storylines weren't as poorly executed and dull as they are. It would be a better idea to find the tokyopop manga somewhere and read that instead of watching the rest of the anime."
5,"It was worth the wait , My Wife Loves Kodocha she Enjoyed it!","Kodocha is a great anime from a girl that has a great life,but with her hapiness come allot of hardships and all type of topics Adult kind of topics which are great they help you realize and understand life. Sana Kurata age 11 is a great lively person but sometimes its a exterior method she utalize's when she's in pain or hurt. Akito hayama is the person she loves but too innocent to accept. a person she will have to learn to lose till she understands how much she loves. Watch i do recommend i wish they made season three"
5,love it,i highly recommend it for all Catholic families with young children and teenagers - very well done and beautifully illustrated
3,Be afraid of bees!,"I actually purchased this book for my husband as an inside joke. We had seen it in an eclectic children's store in Santa Barbara and found one particular part very funny: it tells readers that though sharks are dangerous, not to worry because you're more likely to be killed by a bee sting. We thought that was brilliant for a children's early reader. Who are the people publishing these things? I had to give it a 3 because of what other people say about the information being factual and all that. But seriously?"
4,Great book,My kindergartner loves reading this book....it is just the right level for him for a quick half-hour read before bed. He can read it alone but might have a question or two about a word. The pictures are great and I like how they don't mince facts. It didn't bother him at all as he is a science-y kid who also loves dinosaurs. I might have been bothered by it when I was a kid but I was much more sensitive about things. I guess it depends on the kid.
4,A Very good Budget PC,"I received my computer yesterday and it was a pleasant surprise for me to open the box and take it out. Before ordering this one, I personally did not like the appearance of non-widescreen computers but this computer changed my view.256MB RAM is a bit less and with shared video memory, XP crawls on this. Adding extra RAM is highly recommended, which I did by adding 512 module separately. After this small modification, this computer works wonderfully.Beware of one small feature of HP's default system settings while you install the drivers. They set Clear type setting for smooth screen fonts, which make them blurred (display settings->Advanced->Effects). It took a while for me to figure that out.In Summary, VERY happy with this purchase. Could not have expected more from a computer of this price (got it for $499.99AR from CUSA)!"
4,extraordinary for the money,"Bought the M2010 from Circuit City about two weeks after it was introduced for $600 after rebates (all of which have come through, I'm glad to say). I felt it was an extraordinary value then and after using it for several months I haven't changed my mind. Although 40gig in on the short side these days, it appears more than adequate, and in any case one should always have an external HD or disc burner for backup (having had 5 HD failers since 1979, I speak from experience.) My immediate upgrade was an additional 512 meg memory. The great weakness of the M2010 is it's 6 cell battery, which will not get you through a 2 hour DVD; a 12 cell is available, but only from HP at $180, about 1/3 the price of the whole computer."
3,"How True, How True.",The title says it all. If you are a sister running from one bad relationship to another read this book. It will not help to improve your situation but it will give you something funny to laugh at. She covers ever aspect of dating in less that 150 pages. I read it in 2 hours.
4,"A good, short tale!","I thought that I have read it all. Leeping over fire hydriants in a single bound is defeinetly a new one. This book was a good, short, and very-funny read. I read it in one day and enjoyed every word of it."
1,A waste of valuable time,This story had no point to it. The whole scenario of her looking for a man could have been told in one sentence. Instead she goes on and on about her search for love. The story is somewhat camouflauged by her sassy attitude but still the character is tired and boring which makes the story boring as well
2,An Unneeded Second Attempt,"This was an unnecessary attempt at a remake of ""The Lodger,"" a story about a tenant suspected of being Jack the Ripper. It did not improve upon the original."
3,Jack the Ripper Movie,"Jack Palance does a very good job in this role. Although I gave it 3 stars, it is still worth watching."
4,The new 'Betty Crocker',"Don't be insulted or missled. This is the new age book for a cook begining to cook at home. It covers everything you need to know to prepare and serve delicious foods that almost anyone would enjoy. The emphasis is on 'how to' followed by what to cook.It starts at the begining, what pots, tools, and techniques you must have on hand to start to enjoy cooking. It is first rate for that person!I thouroughly enjoyed this book, but if you are an accomplished home chef, pass it by.DOC"
4,Great if you're not culinary trained already,"I like that this has a lot of pictures of the steps and finished product. I also like the recipes.However, considering that I went to culinary school myself, I expected a just a tad more from the recipes. The only one I seem to be excited to try is their Lobster Bisque. I have been told mine is the best but this recipe is doing a few things I hadn't thought of.I also bought the Cordon Bleu book but it doesn't have as many pictures and only the Advanced portion seems like what I'm looking for.Maybe I'm too picky but there aren't a lot of ways to get additional training outside of formal culinary school."
2,Lacks techniques.,"I purchased this book because it was put out by CIA and I thought I could improve my cooking techniques. Unfortunately, the techniques described are very brief and amateurish. This book is more of a coffee table book with nice photos."
3,Life after Van Der Valk,"I'm probably being a little bit harsh in giving this book only three stars-- I think from a writer who was not Nicolas Freeling it would have easily cleared four-- but it isn't up to the par of his usual standard, even while it is a decent read._The Widow_ is set after the death of Van Der Valk in _Aupres de Ma Blonde_ and features his widow Arlette setting up a counseling service/detective agency in Strasbourg with her new sociologist husband. She starts off with what she thinks is a girl being treated badly by her family and ends up in an entirely different and more dangerous kettle of fish.Given that Arlette was one of my least favorite elements of the more standard Van Der Valk novels, I'm honestly suprised that I liked it as much as I did. It's hurt by the initial pages, which are unnecessarily confusing in setting the stage. It's definitely not where to begin with Freeling, but is something for the real fan."
4,Hartman for Lovers Scores,Mellow and soothing. Every song is better than the one before. Add candles and a romantic dinner and you've got it made!
5,Incomparable!,I wanted to hear a beautiful voice sing beautiful lyrics! Johnny Hartman's voice and clear articulation represent vocal artistry at its absolute best. It doesn't get any better!
3,I wish I could speak French,"Brigitte Bardot was the greatest French sex symbol of all time. She was also a fairly successful pop singer. This CD contains some of her songs, which are cute French pop songs. The best ones are the two written by Serge Gainsbourg; ""Harley Davidson"" and ""Contact"". For some reason, the CD also contains five instrumentals by Francis Lai. Not that there is anything wrong with that, they are decent pop instrumentals. Anyone with an interest in French pop music will probably enjoy this."
4,excellent for learning and understanding,"This book is wonderful for people who have been away from the Church and would like to understand the Rosary. It is also great for those who have recited the Rosary for years without understanding the history and the whys. The information is disseminated in an easily understood manner and one that is quite engaging. I would recommend it to anyone, Catholic or not, who would like to understand more fully why Catholics pray to the Virgin Mother and use the Rosary."
5,Rosary,"This is a beautiful book. It explains the wonders of the most beautiful prayers in existence, as well as the mystery of the Rosary"
5,Fast-Paced Sci-Fi Action!,"Easily the best of the Appleseed books, book 4 is an egde of your seat thrill ride that takes the Appleseed characters to their limits. The characters are stretched beyond their limits with more detective work and a complex mystery that comes to a spectacular conclusion. The fight scenes are amazing, and the whole book takes place in matter of a few hours which keeps it almost real-time and it never slows down. This is my favorite Masamune Shirow work. Highest reccomendations."
3,Simplicity - a reviewing the challenge,Richard Rohr book is a personal exploration of how to respond to the Gospel's without glazing over the bit we often find confronting and try to ignore- Jesus's comments on wealth and how the last shall be first. It also confronts us to stop theorising and start living. You may disagree with his views but it provides a perspective on how to live Jesus's message.
5,AWESOME READ!!!!!,"I have been reading about Simplicity for a little over a year and have found that practicing Simplicity truly enriches your life. This book has to be one of the best books I have read on Simplicity! Richard Rohr is right on target when he speaks about simplicity and the condition of America...and when he addresses the church in America! I found this book to be very thought provoking, eye-opening, and this is quite a powerful book. This book also got me interested in the life and practice of Saint Francis, which lead me into other wonderful books. Richard Rohr is awesome and I was truly blessed by this book. I think people who are truly on the spiritual path tend to be lead into Simplicity and this book will truly be beneficial to all seekers of truth!"
4,Excellent book club or study group material,"This book was the selection for the Fall book club at our church. Although I was expecting more of a ""how-to"" format, I found it to be provocative and engaging. This is the kind of book which not only causes me to think but actually makes me want to make changes in my life. Being a Roman Catholic from the cradle and female, I am surprised that Rohr has been allowed to express such radical ideas about the church hierarchy and the position of women without being silenced by the church. It gives me great hope for my church to know that there are people like Rohr in positions of influence and authority who are openly expressing and promoting these kinds of ideas."
5,Can't wait for sequel,"First time author Kris J. Ryan scores a solid winner with ""Spoon"". Kris creates vivid characters and imagery while maintaining a gripping story line. This book, while directed toward children, will be enjoyed by adults and children alike. Kris takes the battles between good and evil to uncharted areas and does so with entertainingly new twists. Looking forward to your next book."
3,Dissapointed....,"So I had read the first book Angus thongs and full frontal snogging, and I couldn't wait until the next one came out! So I went to my new school and they had it at the library but there was a long waiting list to read it, finally, my friend had read and finished it, so she lent it to me. I spent a sick day reading it, laughing outloud alone in my room. The book was fine, except that I was left down at the end, I mean she seemed to be in the same place with robbie, I mean I know thats how real life is, but if i wanted real life I could read my diary! Plus I didn't really like the way the book ended. I mean it seemed like a silly thing to write ""Oh whats gunna happen next!?"" other wise I was thrilled during the book the story was great, but the ending was silly, but still theres always a next time...."
3,"Lots of solid slapstick humor, but in the end not too bright","The narrator's witty use of words and unexpected schemes definetely crack you up, but perhaps what is more to be laughed at is the narrowness of the kind of life she lives. Boys, clothes, thick friends, and is there much more to it? I admit reading this book really does make you feel good - if you can laugh at Georgia's problems, what are your own in comparison? The cover plainly suggests the story is not at all serious and the book remains true to that. So if you're looking for a light read to break you free of a ho-hum mood, this book oughta do it; just beware that the shallowness can get pretty frustrating."
4,Review for Georgia,This book is extremeley funny and gives you an overview of a real teenage girls love life; the ups and downs. I loved this book and I can't wait to read the next one.
5,"Fabity, Fab, Fab","This is one of the funniest books I have ever read. I read it on the train and I laughed out loud and people were staring at me.I actually was very sad before I read this book because I was on my way to some foster family. But even though I was close to tears, my mood changed, I started laughing like crazy while I read this book. If you want to laugh a lot you should read this book, you won't regret it."
5,More Snogging Good Fun!,"Georgia Nicolson is back! At the end of the first book, Georgia managed to hook up with Robbie the Sex God. All is right with the world. But now, we start with Georgia being told by her parents that they are probably going to move to New Zealand! And before they move, they will spend the Summer there. Georgia has one week before she leaves and the SG (Sex God) had to make a short trip and will return after she has left!Luckily, a steam vent convinces Georgia's father that they should not move to New Zealand (it shot his boot off). Georgia gets to stay! But then the SG dumps her (he thinks she might be to young). But Georgia is determined to get him back.Plot follows scheme as Georgia tries to reel the SG back in while having to deal with the craziness of her life and the world around her.Plenty more of the humor that made the first book so funny. Once again I found myself laughing out loud while reading (a usually very rare occurrence). Funny funny funny stuff."
4,On the Bright Side I'm Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God,"This was the diary of Georgia Nicholson who is 14 years old and is going through high school. She begins dating Robbie, a boy she's been admiring for a year, and her dad tells her they have to move to New Zealand. Georgia, her mom, and her sister Libby decide to stay home and she is able to continue living her normal life. This book was very easy to read and was hysterically funny. It's great for teenage girls to read and relate to many of Georgia's moments."
4,Opinion,"I personally enjoyed this book a great deal. It has so many emotions that many teenagers go through crammed into one little book. A lot of it was hilarious and real. I could kind of relate to Georgia, the main character.There were numerous parts that I thought were the best. I especially liked how Georgia and Robbie got back together in the end. I also like the creativity of Georgia's plan to make Robbie notice her. And her attempt to get back together with him.Throughout the book I could picture everything. It was all so vivid, and I had my own idea of what everything looked like. The characters were described really well according to Georgia's eye, and I knew the plot was well thought of. The conflict was definately believable, and how she tries to solve it is funny."
5,perfect perfect perfect.,"this is the best look into the mind of a 14 year old girl that i've read, EVER. it's scarily accurate. it's also wonderfully light and funny, so if you're not looking for something that'll take a lot of brainpower and you need to laugh, read this book."
5,hahahahahahaha,"Just as hilarious (if not more!) as the first book of this series!! Again Georgia struggles with her ""labrador sized"" cat, Angus, getting attention from Robbie (aka the sex-god), and pulling as many pranks as she can at school without getting in trouble for it. Definetly recommended to anyone with a sense of humor."
5,Hilariously Funny,"This is my favorite book out of the whole set!!! It made me laugh out loud, and i got a few wierd looks that day, but this book is great as well as the other three, so read em'!"
4,on the bright side...,"Georgia is back with a hilarious bang! She is now the girlfriend of the Sex God Robbie Jennings whom she chased so hard after in the last book. But when Robbie suddenly drops her like a sack of potatoes because she is to ""young"" for him it doesn't settle to well with Georgia. She then decides to get the SG back with operation mature glacier (you will have to read the story to know what that means) and get a new guy to make Robbie jealous. But when Robbie comes back as planed how come Georgia cant seem to get Dave the Laugh (the guy that Georgia used to make the SG jealous) out of her mind. Full of Georgia's ridiculous antics and wit this book will have you laughing for hours."
5,You will not like this book...you'll love it,I was very unsure how this one would set up against it's predesessor but it's brilliant. That's all- go out and a buy it. You'll love it. Again Georgia is set up against the horrible misfortune of her teenage life. I can't say anything more- so go read.
2,On the bright side im now the girlfriend of a sex god,I thought that this book was okay i mean it wasn't as good as the first on. the first one REALLy made me laugh but in this particular book Georgia is not a very likeable character. she is snobby and rude to her friends and thinks of no one but herself. she is constantly thinking that her life sucks and its not that great hearing complints. Georgia is also not getting any smarter in school. As far as i'm concerned the barette thing was really unneeded in this book. And her father in new zealand? i don't really understand the thigs that pop up from the ground and constantly injure people but then again thats just me.
2,Pre-teen entertainment,"Short , amusing and light content is not what I usually digest. Perfect for that long ride home or to nowhere when you're bored ... and desperately need some form of entertainment. Apart from ... jokes and impressions of ... friends that were created. This can be easily related to a glossy magazine read that is just a little bit thicker."
3,Well hmmm........,"This is the exact opposite of good literature. The characters are pretty shallow, the plot is not TERRIBLY engaging, and (as others have said) the attitudes are certainly bad. That said, this (and Angus, Thongs, etc) are the two funniest books I have ever read. I ignored everyones advice and actually DID read this in my algebra class, and it was a mistake...I was literally in hysterics in the middle of class. This is not a GOOD book, but I would still recommend it. It's too, too funny to miss."
2,Bad condition,"So when I bought the book, the seller said, ""very good"" for the condition.When I received it like a week later, I found the book to be missing like several pages,about the first 80 pages or so.In conclusion, it sucked."
1,"""On the bright side, now I'm a total loser"" by texan13","This book is the epitome of sinful. What kind of person would name a book this? Mothers, how can you let your daughters read these books? Don't you have any values? This has no moral value whatsoever. This is the handbook for teenage pregnancy. 13 years old is underage for all of this. Our teenage girl stars of today (not naming names) are the examples of what the girls turn into after going through this pressure and if you want your kids to end up like this, let them read this book."
4,Good book!,"This was a really good book! It made me laugh out loud in some instances, and since i love everything British, i really liked learning all the English slang in the back of the book. Not quite as good as the first one, a little plotless, but altogether really good!"
5,"More Georgia, Please!","After reading Angus, Thnons, and Full Frontal Snogging I could only wait 2 1/2 days to get the sequel. I only reccommend this book for only ages 12 & up though, or else you will be wondering what 1/2 of the information means and won't enjoy it nearly as much! MORE GEORGIA, PLEASE!!!"
5,Excellent book,"Georgia's back in the sequel to Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging, only this time she's the girlfriend of a sex god. Georgia's going through normal teen stuff, except for the fact that the rest of her family is anything but normal. Her mother and father are making her move to New Zealand with them, she has to put up with her best friend(Jas) talking about her boyfriend(Tom) all the time, and she's got a crazy younger sister(Libby). Not only that, but her mother is going back into her teenage years and flirting with the new doctor. Things couldn't get any worse.This is an excellent book for anyone who loved Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging, or The Princess Diaries."
5,I hope there's another sequel....,These books are SO funny! I love them because she is so wacky!! You just have to wonder if boys have these kinds of problems....
3,Great title,"The title made me read it. Georgia Nicolson's way whinny for me. I guess this is English humor. If you're under 16, skip it."
5,A Great Sequel!,"Fourteen year old Georgia is now going out with the ""Sex God,"" aka Robbie, but since there is an age gap Robbie breaks up with Georgia. Georgia has a plan, she is going to become a boy magnet! As if breaking up with Robbie wasn't hard enough her parents want her to go to New Zealand because her father is living there now. If you read the 1st book (Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging) you know nothing is ever perfect in Georgia Nicolson's world!Just as funny, creative, and great as the first I highly recommend it!"
5,Hilarious!,"This book will have you laughing so hard, you'll have to run to the 'piddily diddily department'! Seriously, this is a must read, and garanteed to cheer up the unhappy. Our star, Georgia Nicolson is easy for any girl in her teens to relate to, and the situations she gets into are so inane and funny, you'll be begging for more!"
4,Enjoying this series,"I am far from a teen, but I absolutely love Georgia. I was surprised that I liked the first book, but this one I knew I would love as well, especially having stalked the sex god and aquiring him :) Georgia's diary is such a good read. funny and very entertaining."
4,Good,Good classic cartoon with an inspirational message.(Although not as entertaining as the original.)
2,"Works, but does not support standby mode","The PSU Energyzer works fine powering an XBOX360 with a regular ATX power supply. The real downside, however, is that the ATX power supply does NOT go into standby. As a consequence, the fan of your power supply will not shut off when you turn off your XBOX360.This is a very poor design decision, since any current ATX power supply is able to go into standby. It has been irritating me so much, I am not using the PSU Energyzer anymore. I have gone back to my orgininal, but loud XBOX power brick."
1,Doesn't work with new 360,"I just got my 360 back from a RROD repair, and now it doesn't work at all with this cable. I'm using a modular 400W psu, and it was working before I sent the console out for repair. I assume that they just replaced the console with a newer version, and I'm having the same problems others mentioned here. If you're not sure if your xbox will work with this unit you should probably steer clear."
5,Works Great!,Make sure you have an adequate power supply to run your XBox360 with. I use an +12V 18A Power supply and it works great. I would recommend not running a power supply with any less than +12V 16A. Good luck guys.
3,An acceptable blue,'Blue cheese of cylindrical shape made from cow's milk. It has been produced since 1920's when the Maytag's founded their family farm producing cheeses. This cheese is not produced in huge volumes as the cheesemakers want to keep the tradition of hand-made cheese and offer only best quality cheese to the customer. Maytag Blue has a crumbly texture and it reveals a very spicy flavor. The period of curing and maturing takes six months. Other cheeses from the production of Maytag Dairy Farm include White Cheddar and Edam. This cheese is used as a table cheese for dressings and salads'.
3,life with unix humanizes the cryptic code,biff is the dogs name that barked at the mailman; biff is the routine that alerts the operator to incoming email. it goes on and on. the various celebrities of the creation had their reasons and this book puts them out there. it helps me to know how and why and who and when.
5,Music,I was raised during World War 2 which was when Vera was most popular. But her voice and delivery are still great and a real bonus to my collection of CDs.
4,Obrigado,"Gives the informed traveler, or just the informed and curious, necessary insight into what makes up ""Brazilianness."" He portrays a nation of contrasts and ironies. Good read if you're interested in the subject"
3,Accurate enough at the time but out of date now,"As a Brazilian I was curious about how Brazilian culture is perceived by a non Brazilian. Unfortunately, I didn't notice or it wasn't stated that this book was published/copyrighted back in 1995. Since then a lot of things have changed in Brazil. The author needs to update this book or write a new. Fortunately, I only spent approx. $4.75 for this as a used paperback."
4,Describe Brazil from colonization to 1980s,If you are looking for a book to understand Brazil from colonization in 1400s to 1980s then it is a good book. This book will keep you interested to not miss a paragraph.
2,Why would a DJ mixed cd be tracked out?,"The track selection on this album is great, but why would you ever track out a DJ mix cd like a pop record? You're ready for the transition to hit and the speakers go dead for 2 seconds before the mix picks back up (often horribly) - are you joking!?No disrespect, Phantom 45 is one of my all-time favorite DJs (arguably one of the best Junglists EVER), but the production of this album ruins it."
2,dime a dozen american dnb,phantom 45 is one lame jump-up techy dj whom i can't believe had a mix cd made that gets sold on amazon in the first place...i know dj's down the street that are better than him. just goes to show that perhaps who you know really is better in this buisness...
4,"Needs an insole, but-","I love the look of these. I get nothing but compliments on them. I also have them in the tan flax color, and I used to have them in red. They're inexpensive and really cute. I first started wearing them about 9 years ago, of course have had to replace them from time to time, but they aren't expensive, so I think that's ok. I get approximately 3-4 summers of wear out of mine. However, they have NO arch support, so I put an insole in mine, that's why they get 4 stars and not 5. With that, I'm comfortable enough to walk for miles-literally. I couldn't get through summer without them."
3,black silk maryjane shoes,These shoes were too wide for me and they had a terriblefule-oil odor to them. Thus I had to return them
5,"Jazz Icons, II","Jazz Icons, Vol. 2 (8 DVD Box Set featuring Bonus Disc)A fantastic compilation; would recommend to any jazz fan or historian."
1,Inadequate,"I bought this product during my recent trip to Malta. The only good thing about this course is the audio material. Other than that it is totally insufficient. It's totally low beginners material. The best course so far, which I also purchased during my trip to Malta is ""Learn Maltese, Why not?"" both the textbook and the workbook. The only thing is that the latter does not come with audio files. But then again it makes it very clear how letters are pronounced, and this book and watching an online Maltese TV channel does it. I paid 32 euros for the Beginning Maltese course in Malta, and in my opinion it's only worth 7 euros, if not less, just because of the CDs that come with it. Lame work!!"
5,"""Lord Change Me""","""Lord Change Me"" - I read this book many years ago, and lent it to someone else to read. I wanted to reread it and share with family members as well. This is an excellent resource to have."
5,America's History with the Kent family,It has been over 30 years since I read these books the first time. They are even more relevant now. Fascinating writing about our counrty's birth as experienced by the fictional Kent family.
2,Boring a hugh dissapointment the worst so far,The fourth in the Kent family cronicles is so far the worst in the series. I found the 3rd book to be the best so far so ic ould not wait to read the Furies and waht a dissapoinment. The book is so boring and it drags on and on. It's not like the other book's with the war's and the great stories this book is boring. I found the charactors really boring and have no life in this book. I hope the next one is good.
1,john jakes,"ordered a series of eight books and received a package with only one book but charged for full price. returned the one book to amazon, waiting for the full amount to be credited back to mastercard."
1,HUH?,I ordered this set. A week later it shipped. What arrived was Vol 7 only. It's condition was pretty good but had a cover price of $2. I paid $28 for this. Amazon said I could send it back for full refund. Why don't they just send me the other 7 volumes? Won't order from them again unless they clear it up (without me having to ship anything back).
4,good tribute Album,"alot of great talent paid tribute to lady Diana. my favorite track is ""Every Nation"" which was Composed&produced by the World Music GLobal King R. Kelly . this Disc has alot of Good material&great talent through out.can't believe it's been almost 10 years since Lady Diana passed.still very uplifting."
3,Mild Disappointment,"I bought my first aroma neck wrap in the Westchester Mall from a vendor in a booth. The product was made in Israel and we have enjoyed using it for years. Now the market is filled with cheap imitations that don't quite measure up. These are just OK, not wonderful. They don't seem well sewn or properly filled. But, for $20 you get exactly what you pay for."
3,"Cool, but cheaper elsewhere","These tins are functional and are great space savers if you have a lot of magnetized surface area in your kitchen. However, I buy mine at my local grocery store (Pathmark) for $1.69 each."
1,Bait and switch,I thought this was a great deal... The picture has since changed but I thought I was getting 4 tins per set and ordered 9 sets... imagine my surprise when it shows up with only 9 containers... I have ordered lots of things online and never had an issue. They did change their picture so that should help others from making the same mistake. But shame on this seller for being so misleading.
4,"Not cheap, but worth the price.","We had previously bought cheaper magnetic clear lid containers. It was a waste of money. They rusted, the lids wouldn't come off etc. Pure junk. I found these locally for a bit over 3 bucks each. We have been using them for over a year with no issues. Open as good as the day I bought them.Watch what you pay and look locally before buying on line. Most better kitchen shops will have them. If Amazon carried them directly, I'd buy that way."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"I liked her last album. It was like indie-folky singer-songwriter stuff. This new album totally sucks. The title track is barely even a song. It's like a kinda electroclash dance track, very percussively oriented and there's only 2 lines of lyrics, repeated incessantly. It really sucks. Lullaby For Scout In Ten Years is also more rhythmmic than melodic, and harmony isn't even considered. Most of the song is a simple bass melody, which the vocal melody follows along with note by note. It's sparse and monotonous. This song at least has lyrics though. The vocals remind me a bit of Cat Power. Then there are a couple of bursts of powerchord rock towards the end, which also follow the bass melody exactly. I guess her mission for this album was to get in touch with her primal rock self of something. It was a bad idea. The songs suck."
1,The book missing the content,"The pages of the content are ripped off. The pen writtings are all over the book. It is in a such bad shape that sometimes it is hard to make out the words. I have received the book in awful condition, even for the used book."
3,1940s Nicholas Nickleby Film,"Despite one or two sterling performances, anyone wanting Nicholas Nickleby in a permanent form should buy either the 1980s RSC perfromance or the 2001 DVD. The RSC version may be overlong and contain some unnecessary scenes and characters but in David Threlfall's portrayal of Smike it has an all-time great performance. The parts of Nicholas and Kate in this early film are more suited in age than the 1980s version, but Nicholas is not up to James Darcy's toucing portrayal in the 2001 version. Nor does Stanley Holloway's worthy attempt at Crummles compare with the masterly one by Freddie Jones in the 1977 version.Indeed to have a completely perfect cast in this panoramic story, one needs the luxury of the five available versions."
4,Great book for solo or small-crew sailors,"This book has great information for solo sailors or those who could become solo sailors with the illness or injury of one person. My husband and I are the only crew for our 40 ft sailboat. He is the more knowledgeable sailor by far, so if he is out of commission for a while, I will be very grateful for the ideas I have gotten from this book."
2,Disappointed,I was particularly interested in the skills necessary to sail single handedly v. with crew. I was disappointed to discover that the author spent very little time discussing the skills needed for single-handed sailing.
5,A Fascinating Book Loaded with Scientific Information,"In this classic, Heyerdahl constructs a raft to sail 4,300 nautical miles from Peru to the South Pacific Islands in order to prove his theory that the natives of Peru could have migrated to these islands thousands of years ago. This book contains a great deal of information of interest to scientists. These include the appearance of previously little-known fish, the scope of marine bioluminescense, the deployment of ocean currents, etc. It is interesting to note that the Polynesians realized that the Earth was round. A re-examination of the common belief that prescientific peoples invariably believed in a flat Earth is clearly warranted."
5,Kon-Tiki,"This is one of the most interesting stories ever. This is my third reading, and it still excites. A must for anyone with a touch of the adventurer in them."
5,Edge-of-seat-couldn't-put-dow-adventure,Mr.Heyerdahl's narration entices you into joining he and his 5 shipmates on a journey across the sea. You experience the trials and tribulations of building the raft and putting to sea amidst sharp criticism. He leaves you feeling everything from the salty sea air to the taste of the fish caught to the exhiliration of utter solitude at sea and finally of the exotic celebration upon landing after over 100 days at sea.
5,All that the sea promises and more!,"This book has all of the allure and excitment of a pirate tale, Swiss Family Robinson and Robinson Crusoe and its real to boot! I am totally buying this book as an addition to my library I'm building up for my children. I think the author's passion for the sea, adventure, history and the Polynesian people are inspiring. This book will make you want to see Peru and the Polynesian Islands, and if like me, you've been there already, you'll want to go back with the book in hand. The only slow point in the writing is in the beginning when the trip is just being put together but once the journey is under way Heyerdahl comes into his own and you are engulfed by the exciting world of the sea, the last great frontier!"
3,Not what I thought it would be,I wish I would have ordered one of better quality. The book is very small and difficult to read. What I have read sofar is not the action-packed story I anticipated but I am not done with the book.
3,Kon-Tiki or Con-Tiki?,"I enjoyed reading this book, so much so that I incorporated it into a research paper of mine pertaining to Tiki statues and their movement and evolution across Polynesia. Heyerdahl's exploits indeed do come across as completely fantastic, as if from an imaginged story. This is mainly because important misadventures were not included in his text, and only after interviewing island natives and a careful look at his discoveries and methods were such things discovered. I reccomend this book to anyone who wishes to read about the great adventures of a single man and his crew aboard a raft, I do not reccomend this work to be taken completely literally and as a scholarly report. If such a book appeals to you, by all means, read it and enjoy it, but I highly suggest doing your homework before accepting his journey as full truth."
2,Do we have to discuss the circling dolphins again?,"While the concept is quite fascinating, the actual ""adventure"" is somewhat boring and uneventful. Not that I need loss of life or violent hurricanes for excitement, but a ""major event"" was the daily circling of dolphins, which Heyerdahl calls to our attention at least ten times. This alone attests to the opinion that the book is not organized or written well. It is a loosely conected batch of ramblings. Perhaps some of the power was lost in the translation, but in general, the story rates right up there with my 3rd grade narrative on my summer vacation."
4,I now want to sail across the Pacific!,"Although the middle part of this book drags (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5), I was really satisfied when I finished reading this book. I was on vacation in Oslo and had visited the Kon-Tiki museum. I had never heard of Thor Heyerdahl before, but from what I saw at the museum, I was very fascinated and intrigued by the story of his trip across the Pacific on a balsa-wood raft. The week I came home I immediately started reading this book, and I was not disappointed. I was really fascinated by the accounts of interaction with sea animals, whales, sharks, dolphins, etc. that I immediately wanted to go sailing on a wide open sea in order to see all these exotic animals that Heyerdahl and his crew encountered. This book allows you to live vicariously and experience three months worth of sailing on a raft in the Pacific Ocean. This is a definite read for the sea lovers and travelers out there in the world who yearn for adventure."
5,Awesome!,"I loved this book when I read it over the summer for a class, and I liked it so much I bought it. The book is in great condition and the story is really amazing."
5,IN LOVE!,"I have an antique dresser that had recessed handles and no hardware stores, or even antique hardware stores carried anything even close to replacing what I needed. But this was perfect because it was so large so I used it completely cover the hole. It has the nice aged antique look, but made to last!"
2,Rehash of Commonly Available Information,"~Based on the title of this book, I expected to learn something surprising or ""ingenious"" about controlling ants. Instead, I found an introduction to ants with little style, and techniques of control that are easily (and more cheaply) found in articles on the web or in magazines -- techniques such as keeping your kitchen counters free of food, buying ant baits at the store, and hiring a professional when the invasion gets bad.The book notes that it's important to know the species of ants~~ in order to control them, but it fails to provide sufficient detail about each species to determine what type are in your home. The book also fails to distinguish between species in its recommendations for control.The text is scant and padded with similarly high-level (and thus not terribly useful) information about other pest insects.~"
3,For Henstrich fans only,"If you are willing to watch Natasha Henstrich in virtually anything, then this movie is a good bet for you. It's a watchable if fairly predictable thriller, in which the main plus is that Natasha does indeed graciously show us her fabulous naked breasts. If that's reason enough to check it out, then I can recommend that you rent or buy this flic. If on the other hand, you are looking for an action-packed movie with a charismatic bad guy and an eye opening climactic conclusion, I'm afraid you will be sadly disappointed by this film."
4,Stunning!,"If you like movies, this one is for you! Filled with everyhting to keep you watching, you wont be dissapointed! I guarantee it. Beautifully scripted, and well executed ""Caracara"" will be a movie you want for your video/dvd library."
5,Excellent Dance CD,"Well i heard the Castles in the Sky song a while ago and got hooked on that, so I decided to buy Ian Van Dahl's debut album- Ace. It is definitely worth the money. Besides having the regular version of Castles in the Sky, it has the great songs Will I and Reason. I recommend buying the singles for both of those. It's a flippin good dance CD so buy it!"
4,I have to disagree with everyone reguarding this cd,"This cd is very good.I am not going to compare this to anything else.I am rating this cd individually. Every song on a cd does not have to be great,as long as you really like 5 or 6 songs i consider that to be enuff. If you want to be picky most artists will sound similar and some songs will seem the same.Every review got on my last nerve cause to give this cd a compliment is like pulling teeth.. I thing ""Satisfy Me"" is a great song and it reminds me of nuthing i have heard before..i also love ""Nothing left to Say"" and ""Try"" is good and ""reason"" is also a very good track.I reccomend this cd. If you want other reccomendations try ANDAIN-summer calling is the song and dj hooligan-hear you now.These tracks are on a cd called DJ TIESTO SUNRISE 3,great cd!!!"
1,Perfect example of cheesy eurotrance,"Poor instruments, boring beats, uninspired vocals, this one is not worth more words. Horrible"
4,Great collection if you don't already have the CD singles,"Last year Ian Van Dahl stormed on the dance scene with Castles in the Sky - what a great tune! Her follow-ups Will I? and Reason are the strongest tunes on the CD. The balance of the CD is very good, but if you already have these CD singles, you won't be getting anything new or noteworthy. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a trashing of the album, but you've heard the best there is already."
3,"Uninspiring, But Okay...","Though I am a big Trance fan, I must say that this album was sort of disappointing. This album contains the kind of tracks one listens to when he/she is chatting online or doing something where his/her attention isn't focussed on the music. I say this because a lot of the tracks sound alike, making it almost like a D.J's continuum/mixed CD ( which it might as well have been) rather than a multi-track album,. Finally, another thing that disappointed me were the vocals. The voices were beautiful, but with no ad-libs and vocal runs it made a lot of the tracks quite boring.To wrap it all up, many of the tracks had so much potential, but the uninspiring vocals and, as a whole, the same-sounding tracks missed the mark. Overall, though, I enjoy the album as a back drop to my busy life."
3,Ace,"After hearing ""Castles in the Sky"" a few times I couldn't wait to get this CD. I listened to that song over and over and also really enjoyed ""Reason"" and ""Will I?"" - for the first week. After that, the disc just got boring and derivative.There is some much better music out there coming from the likes of Gigi D'Agostino and NY-based Fischerspooner.Why 3 stars?:It's good at a party, but only for a bit. You'll tire of it quickly because it all sounds so much alike."
3,Ian Van Dahl,"This album is typical Ian Van Dahl material and if you liked the single releases such as Castles in the Sky and Will I (both featured on the album) then the chances are that you won't find anything on this CD terribly offensive.However there isn't a great deal of variation throughout this album and many of the tracks sound all too familiar. It is a likeable CD but I can never bring myself to listen to it from start to finish because at times I feel as though I am hearing the same song on repeat over and over.I'm not saying that this album is bad, it is worthy to be in a dance lover's collection. But I would suggest that you try before you buy if possible."
2,Terrible Trance,"This CD is extremely dry and boring. I personally like dreamy epic trance, and it seems like this CD contains only 2 tracks with such content. Not a fine choice."
1,The best example of cheesy eurotrance,"Poor instruments, boring beats, uninspired vocals, this one is not worth more words. Horrible"
2,Ew,"Pop-lovers, and raving newbies rejoice...your album has arrived. Trance lovers...avoid this at all cost. Dont get me wrong, its a good album for trance newbies, or all those of you that get your trance from MTV, and have attended 2 raves, one of which you slept through."
2,Big let down,"This CD is a huge let down. I was expecting greatness, especially after reading the reviews for this CD. This CD is mediocre at best, a poor example of a trance/ dance CD with vocals.The singer gets very annoying by the 3rd or 4th track. Each track is started with a question that is intended to be though provoking, but ends up being comical.The beats are also mediocre, you get the feeling that you are listening to the same couple of tracks over and over again.It comes with a bonus CD which feels more like a bonus coaster than a bonus music CDThis CD is very boring. I would not recommend buying this CD."
5,Vitashell not just for turtles!,"I have been using Vitashell as a cuticle cream (finger and toe nails), hand cream, and facial night cream (just a thin layer does it). It makes my skin feel impeccably soft and my nails are strong and the tips white. I highly recommend this if you are looking for a product with great natural ingriedients."
1,Received Teacher's Edition,"I was looking for the textbook and instead I received the Teacher's Book that didn't have the material from the Textbook.Such a waste of time, energy and money!"
1,Repetitive and presumptious text book,"Biglio makes sweeping generalities and presumptions and THEN presents them as FACT without support. Very frustrating. If that's not enough, he THEN repeats himself as if the act of repitition can make his statements true."
5,Creatively Classical!,"the most familiar classical melodies, arranged in a child-friendly, palatable style using both folk and orchestral instruments; Listen to Strauss' Blue Danube Waltz and find the mandolin's participation; Enjoy Ravel's Bolero, with a panpipe and Bizet's Toreador Song with marimba. My kids are hooked and so am I!"
2,"Good review of industry, not much substance","While the author has done a great job reviewing how these deals unfold (as well as a nice review of the players involved), there is little substance to how the economics work. This book is a good into for a b-school student trying to figure out what part of the financial industry he/she would like to pursue."
3,Be careful,"Philips has abandoned this whole technology last month thus there will be no followup versions, i.e. its an orphan technology. These are being firesaled. This is a good TV at a great price but go into deal with eyes open. Refer to avsforum.com and seaarch on PHILIPS and LCOS and look at owners thread. Buy an ext warranty."
5,5 Stars for Mr. Ball's BoxSet,"I have a little bias since I've had the pleasure of working with Steve and other musicians appearing on these CDs for a while now. However, one of the things that particularly struck me with these recordings is how the excellent guitar work doesn't get in the way of the Music that drips from these CDs. Roadshow (CD1 of 3) has a wonderful blend of all original compositions many of which have a delightfully pop sensibility to them. Pop and Guitar Craft are rarely heard in the same sentence! Naive Melodies (CD2 of 3) is a great collection of uniquely interpreted covers from a wide range of artists from The Who to U2 to Brian Eno. I love all of these, but perhaps my favorites are Wave with the beautiful additional female vocal and Under the Milky Way with the stunning emotive E-bow lead intro. Finally, but not least, Knotwork (CD3 of 3) is an all instrumental collage. The musical textures on this CD are wonderful and at times breathtaking."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I purchased this item from an online pet store. I liked the fact that it is a good size and it is easy to read. However, it only worked for a year. The unit continuously malfunctioned even after installing new batteries figuring that would have been the problem. Unfortunately it wasn't. It kept saying it was over 100 degrees in the tank. My fish would have been like scrambled eggs in my tank if that were true. Luckily I had a portable PH/thermometer handy to double check for accuracy. I had to order a completely different thermometer. I don't normally write bad reviews on products, but I wanted to let you know so you don't make the same mistake. If you are looking at a digital thermometer, then I would recommend one made by Coralife. It is small, but works great."
2,Stopped working after 2+ years,"The thermometer worked fine for about 2 years, but now the in-tank temperature reads about 8-10 degrees F too high. I contacted the manufacturer to request a replacement but was denied as the product only carries a 1-year warranty."
3,It work for a while,"I have this temperature readout for more than a year and for almost that long it reads my aquarium water temp at 64 degrees during this Winter season, so I bought a glass mercury temperature gauge attached inside the aquarium. It reads 79-80 degrees. The room temp reading is the same (I couldn't say correct to a ""T"") as my other room temp monitor/gauge. I didn't throw it out b/c I can still use the room temp readout.I like to get another one because it has a good display appearance, easy and large digital numbers display but I am having a second thought to take another chance."
2,Lasts about 1.5 to 2.0 years,"Like the others, I enjoyed the size of the display. I also liked the fact it displayed both the room temp. and the aquarium temp. (in/out temps) I liked my 1st one so much, I bought another for my 2nd aquarium. But like the other reviews, both thermometers began reading high and/or low. Cleaning the sensor helped a bit but only for a day or so. As for my use: 2 freshwater tanks, prefered temp. is 78F to 80F, heaters are 1.5x the size needed to regulate a tank the size it is used in to minimize heating time, room temps are kept around 71F in winter, 76F in summer."
5,An introduction to meditation,"A.A. Bailey's books usually contain very rich, yet hard to understand information. The effort of reading it is as important as the content itself. This book is perfect to begin reading A.A. Bailey. It sets the basis to understand the concepts of intuition, intellect, and meditation. It also brings practical exercises to begin daily meditation. This is not a commercial manual, or light reading. It's for people who already know the path they want to take, and who are serious about it."
2,meditation for true believers,"About the only good thing in this book on meditation is the accurate delineation of the stages on the path to transcendence. Otherwise it is badly dated, verbose and written in the absurd over-earnest manner that makes a great deal of esoteric literature hard to tolerate.The prescribed method is a prayer-mantra, the effectiveness of which depends on the intensity of one's religious convictions. In short, meditation works best for the true believer. Mrs Bailey seems blissfully unaware that people without any religious faith whatsoever can attain - via an entirely secular mantra - exactly the same inner freedom.The most serious flaw is Bailey's proselytising in the final chapters. She dishonestly uses quotes from the great mystics (that she has used appropriately in the book to this point) to suggest they agree with her own eccentric cosmological and theological views.Buyer beware!"
5,Ghostly intriguing,"A story of the trials of a family blessed ( or cursed ) with a supernatural gift handed down from generations past, this book held my attention to the very last page. A taste of South Carolina history along with the intrigue of the supernatural,with the strong ties of family make this one interesting book.I read it in one day! I would like to see more from Sally Glass."
4,Good,"It did not arrived on time, but when it did, it arrived in perfect conditions. I would buy from this user again."
5,this book is a work of art.,"As a lover of cats and the written meaning of words, this book is extraordinary.The contents express the true thought of the cat, plus the siteful interpretation, of man, thru photograph and word.The strength of picture and meaning leap at you, as you turn the pages. Drawing you in deeper and deeper, as you rush to finish viewing your first siting, of this adventure.Encouraging you to view immediately, once again the site of photo and word.This collection is a great gift and a great addition to anyone's collection."
1,BAAAAAAAAAAADDD!!!!,"The acting by one of the main characters, Shawnee, is so bad that I was cheering that it appeared he was going to die from surf injuries, simply so I wouldnt wince so badly every time he attempted to utter a line. He had spoken no sentences more than 5 words for the entire first two episodes and when he did speak it was like a jr. high acting student in a first lesson. The plot script and dialogue in this movie is so hideously poor, it seems almost certain that it was intentionally made to flop. Who could possibly think this was even slightly good??? And , to top it off, there really isn't any great or prolonged surf footage to at least partially redeem it . Terrible, terrible, terrible. I hope you don't waste your money on this."
2,a realy odd show.,"I realy had high hopes for this show..I can see why they canceld it..some parts were realy good,other were in left field..if you can get a good deal on this dvd box set(under 20.00) buy it..at retail you might want to just shoot youself in the foot first.."
1,Written by a roomful of monkeys?,"This show is okay at first, but as it gets more ridiculous and irritating, it finishes as a steaming pile.People made any money on this hype time-waster?!Maybe a perspective from brain damage would help.However! Some ""fun"" characters as well as some very irritating ones. whatever!"
5,"Remember, it's just a ride.","I just want to make one quick statement... JFC is the best show I've EVER seen in my life. I am not one of those people that will give 5 stars to everything I like. This show really was the best show ""I"" have ever seen in my life. I think many of the people that didn't like this show didn't understand it. People don't like to have to think when they watch TV. TV generally numbs the mind with shows like ""American Gladiators."" People don't want to think... when watching TV. This show makes you think. This show makes you question reality. This show is that good."
5,awesome,the further into the season the stranger it got; in a good way. i'd recommend this series to any adult.
5,Coincidences are Gods Way,"David Milch is the Shakespeare of our time.Like the great bard Milch writes for the commoners; TV.Apparently he works with a ""troup"" of actors who switch up roles before our very eyes.Best of Milch is the whole production is so hard to follow yet so beguiling that one must go on and on and....I would be buying anything done by Milch!Alas and alack.How is it that someone so profound,tricky and hilarious isn't ON?"
5,Simply Fabulous,"I'm so glad this series is available to buy. John from Cincinnati is simply fabulous! It has been a long time since I waited with such glee for the next episode. ""John"", the ""alien"" so perfectly reflects the pathologies which ruin the lives of so many people. Then his energy heals them and they are so happy! Suggest this is just what happens in the secret lives of many of us....it isn't a brain thing, but a heart thing. If people would revisit this series and contemplate its meaning, many would be amazed at the truth of it.Clearly there was a second season planned. Let's have it out!"
2,Enrique Y Su Tamborazo Zacatecano Samaniego,"The music is great, this tamborazo gets down..... (but) The lead singer, Enrique Samaniego kinda just ruins things for me. These songs would of been great if he just didnt show up to the studio the day they recorded."
5,A great read,"I enjoyed this book immensely. Tempered with humor, it provides great guidance in terms of dealing with a parent suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The childhood memories included were also particularly touching. I highly recommend it."
3,Video,The video is well done and no one is a bigger fan than me but go watch the video for free on their offical web site. It is time for Prodigy to come out with a new album and stop trying to pass one song in years to the fans as a CD and then DVD. It is also time to tour the US if you want us to buy your warez. Maybe this signals they are not happy with their current label? Trade-em Maverick so they will start working again.
4,"wicked wicked vid, prodigy style","history, ripped from an NFO file: ""The video was shot in the Czech Republic and is apparently based on a dream Liam had about playing live in front of a herd of cattle!""premiered in the UK on june 5, and supposedly was played in a loop from midnight to 6am the next day.vid is the usual spazzy in-your-face material of Prodigy's faster songs/vids. as for the song, it reminds you.. well, me, at least, of breathe. oh, and it also makes reference to ""Rohypnol,"" which some may (not) care for... but you Prodigy and fanatical bass/beat heavy freaks could care less, eh?some like it; some don't (my friend doesn't) but i'm eating it up right now. being the music vid freak i am, i'm gonna snatch this one up as soon as it comes out... =)"
3,"Good writing, good plot, unbelievable heroine","I just couldn't warm up to Jane da Silva. I missed the descriptions of her home and habits that are sometimes TOO detailed in other mysteries of this type. I have no idea what her house is like, what kinds of clothes she wears, etc. Also, I just did not believe what she was able to accomplish and how much wool she pulled over how many eyes. Also, I prefer when these types of books are in first person. I could then really be in Jane's head and hear her thoughts. Also, a bit too much scenery description. So overall, despite the entertaining and clever plot and the strong, unusual setting, I don't think I'll be reading another da Silva mystery."
5,Thoughts on the new album.,"The first track, ""Sow Some Lonesome Corner So Many Flowers Bloom,"" introduces the major theme of the album: a return to the basics of intense orchestral composition with the introduction of vocal arrangements. As a fan of both Godspeed and Silver Mt. Zion, I'm electrified by this new release."
3,"Some profoundly moving lows, and some not so profound ones","Marred by unneccesary repetition in lo-fi sing alongs with effrin's confusion with equating vulnerability with consciously garbled vocals, there is still some triumps to be found throughout, expecting at least nothing less from this crew..I hope the constant creative output from effrim on these projects does not water down his intake with godspeed, as unfortunate as it is, the most amazing moments on this disc come when he ushers in that beautifully doomed gutair sound he has crafted and articulated so well for his true band..."
5,very useful for me,"I have used these capsules for years and they have helped me immensely. My problem with dry eyes started when I was practicing law and spending long hours staring at the Code of Federal Regulations. A thrill for anyone. At that time I took one capsule a day and did fine. As I have gotten older, I now take 3 per day and need them in order to have comfort when reading. I also have great cholesterol readings despite a family history of heart problems. I think the fish oils in these capsules have helped my cholesterol and I know they have helped my eyes.No supplement works for everyone. I try something and then quit. If I see no difference, I stop taking that one. These make a difference for me and I make sure I am not without them. If you have dry eyes, they are definitely worth trying. You never know. You might see no difference, so you move on to another treatment. You might be like me and become a lifelong devotee."
2,Not Impressed,I did not notice any difference in my eyes after a month's use. These capsules are huge! Will not buy again.
5,Increible fusión,Esta gente le comió los dulces a muchisimos salseros y pleneros con esta fusión. Son todos unos duros.
2,Scoop With Batteries,Sounded good from other reviews but is really too big for our litter boxes. The slots allow lots of small bits to fall through and leave the box not clean enough.
1,False advertising,"This is *not* an eight gigabyte card. The actual formatted capacity of the card is 6.45 GB. That may vary a little from one card to the next, but it's nowhere close to the promised eight gigs. It's about 20% less."
1,"Very lucky, I got a fake one","Purchased an 8G SanDisk CF card from seller ""genuinecollector"". Unfortunately, the CF card is fake. I will leave the Country for 3 month in couple days, so I would just let go this time. But for those whom want to buy a cheap CF card, be careful and don't over trust the price."
1,Use caution,I had this particular item and I lost every picture that I had. It was replaced by another one and that failed also. You will never know when this is going to fail. This card is too big use a smaller one...USE CAUTION
1,Is 7.6 GB not 8.0 GB,"I am not pleasure with my purchase because, I bought a 8GB CF card and tha size of the card is 7.6 GB. That's make me doubt it is a real SanDick Card."
1,Card has writing issues,"This card sucks. I think its genuine, but some of the images become corrupted. I don't see the corrumtion on the LCD of the camera. But when I import to lightroom. Some of them fail. I live overseas and its too much of a pain to ship back, so I guess I'm stuck with it."
5,Perfect Storage Device for Dell Axim,"I bought this CF card to supplement my SD card storage on my Dell Axim X51. I am currently using it to hold my MP3s, several full length movies in portable format, and my TomTom maps. Good transfer speeds via card reader and access times with the device, even with large files. I have always used SanDisk for my flash media needs, and have never had any troubles with their products."
4,Excellent Disk,"Excellent memory card especially for the price. Have used this card numerous times in a Nikon D300. Almost purchased the Ultra III/IV but after reading reviews regarding the quality and speed non-issues, I purchased this one. With a camera such as the D200/D300 I see no need for a faster card. Have used SanDisk cards for years with never a problem."
3,Is Something Going On Here...?,"This 8 GB flash card works just fine - stores about 800 RAW files for my Canon Rebel. My only concern is that the CF pictured is not what I received. I bought this from ChiTek (through Amazon) and got an ""Ultra"" instead of the ""Ultra II."" Label is completely different as well (no SanDisk logo, for instance). Is this the card I ordered with a new design? Is it different but just as good? Is it a downgrade? I don't know. And I didn't have time to research it before I used it (got it in the mail the day I left for an overseas trip). So having used it once, I can attest that it works; but I know there's a lot of counterfeit cards out there, so you might want to investigate before you buy."
2,Not fast enough for continuous shooting,"If you have a camera that shoots 3-9 frames/sec., and you're actually using it to shoot sports, or just trying to capture that exact frame of moving subjetcs - don't buy this item.It's not fast enough....6 frames, and the card slows to a near halt.For everything else, it's all good.Jeppe B. Nielsenwww.angeldustphotography.comPhotojournalist stud."
1,ehhhhh,"As a photographer, I expect my gear to be reliable 100% of the time. 99% reliable is not acceptable. This card is not reliable 100% of the time.Every so often, around every 1000 shots, the card gets an error and deletes the most recent photos taken (anywhere from 1-5 shots). I find this problem happens the most when using burst and then chimping right away (viewing the images). Not acceptable. I've lost, not many, but several good shots from this happening. In case anyone was wondering, my camera is a Canon 7D.Dont buy this card."
1,Big problems with San Disk 8 GB Compact Flash and Canon DSLR,"As a professional photographer, I've used San Disk Compact Flash exclusively years. The 1, 2 and 4 GB San Disk have worked flawlessly for about 5 years with my Canon DSLRs. However, I am NOT pleased with the 8 GB (30MB/s) model. I purchased five for a recent European photo shoot. The 8 GB model consistently fail to record photos on my Canon 7D camera. Particularly when I shoot a burst of 5 to 6 images. None of the images are recorded and I have to remove and reinsert the card to start shooting again. I've corresponded with San Disk and Canon and no one admits to a problem. But there IS A BIG PROBLEM and the 8 MB model is not suitable for professional use, if you can't reshoot."
2,Ultra II Slow,"Sandisk's Ultra II 8GB card is MUCH slower to write than the Ultra II 2GB cards I've used until now. This card may be fine if you're just taking a photo or two -- but sports action photographers will wait forever for the camera buffer to write to the card. Perhaps a different controller is used in this card? I'm not an engineer so I don't know for sure. But the card has been a huge disappointement for me. I use it now only as a last resort, when a large job fills my supply of 2GB cards."
5,Works As Advertised,"Well packaged and works exactly as expected. I don't know if the extra $1.00 for ""retail"" packaging is worth it, but the blister pack was secure."
5,Great CF for the Amateur Photographer,I have been very pleased with this compact flash. The price is just right for the performance it provides. There is no need to purchase a more expensive CF if you are just an amateur taking pictures on an occasional basis. This CF provides plenty of speed even when I was shooting rapid shots at a drag race I recently attended. I did not miss a shot and the 8 GB space provides sufficient storage.
1,defective card,I ordered this card and used it twice. It is defective and does not work - I've lost valuable and irreplaceable images and had to refund clients their sitting fees because of this defective card.
2,RECEIVED A USED MEMORY CARD!!,"I placed this order with DIGITAL MEDIA SOURCE and received it in a timely manner; however, I just opened the case with the memory card and saw that it was clearly used! There was writing etched into the back of the card and the front of the card is slightly scratched up as well. I am very upset and emailed them for a replacement ASAP. I am assisting at a wedding tomorrow and now have no memory card to use--I don't want to take the chance of putting a used card into my brand new camera.DO NOT BUY FROM DIGITAL MEDIA SOURCE!!"
5,SanDisc delivers quality,"I purchased this card to use in a Reconyx game camera. It works great and no problems with formatting, writing or reading. In my application this disc should easily hold 15-20K pictures.There are many cheap compact flash cards on the market but a high percentage of them are bad from the start or have very short life spans. If you need quality digital media it is hard to go wrong with SanDisc products."
5,Nice,"This Ultra II Sandisk CF card is fast enough for my Canon 50D, but I don't shoot action sports or humming birds. I don't have a need for super fast transfer rate from the card to my PC either so it works great for my typical applications."
4,I shoot a canon 50D,Great product. Very reliable. Just a little slow after a burst of speed. But I would surely buy another one. You can't go wrong here. (If the price is right)
5,Perfect Photos!,"Can't beat this for the price! Super Fast shipping. I'm a photographer and I needed it for a wedding. Beautiful photos, took as many as I wanted as fast as I needed. No fumbling with lots of other smaller cards. This is all I needed. I'm very pleased."
5,Great CF Memory,I bought this memory card for my SONY DSLR A200 Camera. I always like taking pictures in full resolution to get maximum result and this CF card has met all my needs. I even take pictures in continues mode and I do not have any complains. Copying to PC is also instant. I higly recommend this product.
2,Good product but...,"Used this product before it works great and the price offered here is unbeatable, however Nutricity ships these out apparently, I ordered this with Expediated or 1 nite shipping on October 2nd, Now October 12th and amazon emails me saying it hasn't been shipped yet due to the provider and reasons are unknown. So it's a little false advertisement, but these are great to use, quick mass, better pumps, especially when you stack these with no2 it enhances the effects of both. But just thought I'd give everyone a heads up, if you're ordering, don't expect to receive it for weeks."
1,Very Bad Quality,We purchased this DVD looking forward to seeing another great Betty Hutton movie and boy were we disappointed! Not at Betty or her talent but at the DVD quality. This is a color movie but the color is so washed out and the contrast was so high it was grim watching. I can not believe anyone would offer something as poor as this. It went back for refund this morning.
1,"Good Movie, Bad Editing","I do not know what others have noticed, but the original Perils of Pauline is very entertaining. However, this version is not the original. This version from Synergy Archive removes about 30 minutes from the original. For anyone that has seen the original this is robbery!!!! Do not buy this version, hold out for the full-length movie."
1,"Great movie, but terrible quality DVD","The quality of this DVD is horrible. Bad coloring and the audio is terrible. My old VHS is better than this ""new"" DVD."
1,The Perils of Pauline,I recieved this order in a fast and timely fashion but the Video tape is no good. It does not work at all.
2,Not all that great really,"As a guitarist myself and someone who has studied many styles over three decades of playing, I've heard and played with some amazing players. The guitar craft style and its practitioners have some nice stuff and good technique within the realm that they explore, but are really far from being complete guitarists. Any great classical musician and/or teacher likes to use this kind of playing as something to avoid falling into. Hardly a shred of passion or personality to be found in even the best guitar craft musicians... and their technique is actually not that amazing. I've played with players that can play far better in every respect. Sorry guys, it's true."
3,Elementary crib sheet,"There is nothing in this guide you can't pick up from excel itself, though it may be useful to have on hand because it summarizes all of the basic Excel operations like entering data, creating a new worksheet, inserting and deleting text, etc. It does not provide any assistance with functions."
4,time well spent,"I've read plenty of historical non-fiction. This was an excellent read, good adventure story and importantly, it held my attention better than the last six books I've read. I've been fascinated, although still largely puzzled by arctic adventures for years--put this one alongside all of the Shackelton and Franklin stuff as worth your time. The book had some interesting little tidbits about Elizabethan courtly life and of course the Inuit then and now. I had no idea the Canadian government i'ded them with a series of numbers and assigned surnames, sad. I guess ours isn't the only government to dehumanize and subjugate indigenous populations."
2,Pressing fault,"When I received this item I found out that it's Still Got Love pressed on BOTH sides of the vinyl. And I actually ordered this single for Be Your Girl, which didn't make it to the wax for some strange reason. Yeah it's cool to have a non-album cut (Still Got Love) on a vinyl but having Be Your Girl was my main objective. I'm quite disapointed..."
1,Horrible Waste of Time and Money,"I bought this product to help me on a trip to Taiwan. Initially, the product appeared to install OK but when I would select items on my Ipod, they repeated the same terms for all options that I selected. I uninstalled and attempted to reinstall and I began to receive a slew of errors. I am now waiting for responses to 5 e-mails after 3 weeks and have received no help from Mogopop or ILingo. Don't buy this!"
4,Nice period score and entertaining pop numbers,"Excellent soundtrack to an excellent film. The several variations on the title theme are each interesting and the other pop numbers (including the Mindbenders, who are quite good) very entertaining. The rest of the disc comprises mainly musical cues and the film's percussive score is evocative of the film. Recommended. Collectors' note : half of the future Led Zeppelin play on this disk...."
5,Stunning,"Contrary to our Canadian friend reviewing this record, it's a stunner. Of course, this is an exact duplicate of the original album, so it contains incidental music and scoring, unlike many of today's soundtracks, which are simply a collection of songs licensed to further vertical integration of a product. The Mindbenders tracks are great - never liked the band much, but these are fine songs, Lulu's stuff is killer, the alternate takes on the title theme fascinating. The rest of the score is good as well - there 's a reason this was a long awaited release. If you simply want the title track, maybe a compilation or Lulu CD would be better, but for those who liked the film's music upon watching it, here ya go!"
2,To Rip-Off With Love Is More Like It ! ...,"First let me say that ""To Sir With Love"" is one of my favourite movies of all time .. So naturally when I saw that the soundtrack was once again available, I jumped .. Too fast I might add.I really love the title song by Lulu (There are 3 different versions here) but the rest of the CD is nothing but filler.The sound is great but the packaging could be better.You'd think that on top of the actual songs from the movie they could have included other songs from the era to make this a complete package ... You'd think ... But then they couldn't rip you off could they ? ... By the way this CD is barely a half hour in length ... Another defect ... I could go on ... do not buy this CD at all ! Do yourself a favour and buy the video or DVD and get a compilation that has the title song ... Pass on this !"
1,A truely sad piece of hateful rhetoric.,"While espouseing one thing the opposite comes out. As a protaganist in the first segment is asofisticated, and obviously spoiled child who cant seem to understand that anarchy is not thething to push in West Virginia. Its not about Freedom of speech. Its about being stupid.I despise the writers intent to try and white wash a hatred of the US by purported love of the US.Ok, I admit it, I am a conservative Libertarian. And yes, freedom of speech is fine and dandy.But the founders also knew that if you used it unwisely it could and would come back and biteyou on the butt. When they wrote the 1st amendment, if you used it and were called on that usage,a duel might be in order. And you might pay for that unwise usage with your very life. ""Thems fightingwords"" comes to mind."
2,below average,Thee-o is an exceptional DJ at numerous rave parties but this CD was just AWFUL. I was not able to get into the music at all. Too much melodies and not enough bass. Each song was somewhere between 2 mins and 3 mins in a CD which contained 10 songs. you do the math.
1,lasted 3 days,"I have a 55 gallon aquarium but it is deep, so I needed a powerful air pump replacement when my unit failed. I got overnight shipping on this, because my fish could not wait. When I took it out of the box and hooked it in, it was VERY loud-but it had good aeration. On the second day, there was no output from one of the ports; and on the morning of the third day there was no output at all. But it had finally gotten quiet!! I placed another overnight order and got my original brand of pump and have had no problems. The whisper pump will not be recommended by me to anyone. The box was well packed and undamaged, so obviously the QA at the factory was not completed."
1,Whisper my @ss,This thing was quiet when I first got it.3 months later it sounds like a pet store.I should've laid down 60 bucks for the Rena.
1,do not buy.....cheap parts inside,i have bought the repair kit for this pump three times already.... every few months the rubber inside breaks and the pump gets real loud and the air flow cuts in half........ spend the money and buy a better pump.....after the initial 25 dollars i have spent 15 dollars on each kit bringing the total to 70 dollars in one year..... i should have bought a better pump to start....
1,Cheap overseas manufactured garbage.,"I bought two Whisper 60s and a Whisper 100 over the last 12 months. They each have two diaphragms (one for each outlet) and every one of them is ruptured. Tetra refuses to sell replacement diaphragms only and will only sell a complete repair/rebuild kit for $10-$12. With shipping costs added in this is way more than half of what the pumps cost ($19-$26). So if you want a pump that might work for a year before it breaks and that you have to spend $15 a year on plus your time to repair, this is it. I put mine in the recycling bin only because its mostly plastic, but the fact is that its really junk. Buy anything but a Whisper. Oh and the name is a joke as well. They are as noisy as any other cheap pump despite the hype about ""revolutionary design""."
1,I can't hear you my air pump is making too much noise...,"How do you figure this is whisper quiet, it makes as much noise as theten dollar econo air pumps. Another triumph for the Whisper group ofbadly tooled aquarium accessories. Never again."
2,Much room for improvement,"Looks nice enough, but that's about it. Was noisy to start with, and downhill from there on.Has double outputs, could not use just one. Finally got the tubes and set it up it to use both. Seems to get noisier as you 'load' it more i.e. tank depth. Have a 120 gal tank and this lasted about 6 weeks.Performance started degrading after about 3, and by 6 weeks has all but lost one output with a near zero pressure.Second output is also beginning to look iffy and doubt it will last much longer. I'd look elsewhere"
1,It was good for only a few months.,"I agree with most of the negative reviews on this air pump. I bought this and it pumped a lot of air the first few weeks. Afterward, the air flow gradually diminished. The replacement rubber parts and repair kits cost almost as much as a brand new pump! I recommend finding a pump with a longer warranty and stuff. If any of you aquarium fans know of a solid air pump with a long life (regardless of cost), leave some feedback here. I am interested - thanks."
1,wasting money,This pump is quiet and good performance for the first two months. After two months there was less air coming out of the pump and death after less than 3 months. I couldn't believe it was last less than three months. I should have invested in a more expensive pump.
1,Disposable air pump?,"I've gone through 2 of these in the last 8 months in a 65 gallon tank feeding a small air stone and a 36"" flexible bubble strip. Quiet enough when concealed in a cabinet and lots of air at first, but then the rubber diaphragms ripped after 3 or 4 months, rendering them useless. Repair kits are available for around $10 + shipping, which would amount to just a little bit less than what I payed for the pump in the first place. I think I'll be switching brands this time instead."
1,"""Whisper"" in Name Only",Our old air pump quit and we bought this as a replacement. Big mistake!This is the NOISIEST air pump that we tested as a replacement. It lasted three days before we couldn't stand it anymore! It has a LOUD AC hum that resonates and cannot be stopped!We returned it and purchased the Whisper 300 instead. The Whisper 300 is the quietest air pump I've barely heard! It's definitely worth the extra bucks.Stay away from the Whisper 100!
2,Whisper?,"So, I bought this even after reading the reviews of it not being very quiet. I figured that the other reviews were from people who hear better than I do and that I could handle the noise. Well, I have to eat my words and say that everything everyone has said about the noise is correct. I have it in the cabinet under the tank and it still sounds like it is sitting right in front of me. I found out that if you stand it up on two of its legs propped against the aquarium salt box, it's a little more tolerable. Seriously, don't buy this if noise bothers you! It does seem to work well though -- lots of bubbles."
2,Unrestricted,"I have two. The one running 100% free air flow without an adjustable valve is going strong and quite after 18 months. The other, connected to a common restrictor valve for a smaller tank, bit the dust in 3 months. The cheap internals can't handle the pressure.Only purchase IF you run it wide-open and do not restrict the flow output."
1,bad pump,"had it a few months(4ish), the rubber seals are torn.. dont buy better to chock up the mon and get a good one."
2,Broke after 3 months.,"It worked really well for what it cost. But after about 3 months, I was having the same diaphragm issues as everyone else and it stopped working entirely about a week after the first signs of degrading. I only got this because I needed something relatively cheap fast.Nothing should break this fast though, no matter how cheap. The only use for a pump like this is to temporarily provide aeration while you get another pump that will actually last."
1,This controller sucks!,Got a set of 2 of these controllers as a gift and I immediately had problems with the recievers. The controller would work great for about 2 minutes then the signal would be lost. I tried to get help through Pelican's on-line customer service and although they agreed that I had a faulty reciever (actually ended up being two faulty recievers) and offered to send me a new one I never recieved one. I've tried several times to resubmit my complaint but I've never recieved another response from them. I would not recommend this product nor any other Pelican product. There must be something better out there.
1,Pelican 2 is hit or miss,"I bought 4 of these controllers thinking they would be as reliable as the original pelican controllers. 1 Worked right out of the box, 1 had to be manually set, and the other 2 didn't work at all in automatic or manual mode. I recommend sticking with the original Pelican 1 controllers or going with a different brand. Otherwise you have a 50% chance of getting a bad controller."
3,"its wireless works fine just feels cheap ,well guess it is","My title pretty much says it a its wireless capabilities are great and it feels alot like the xbox(microsoft) controller at first but not so fast feel it again my friend.Its buttons are way to cheap feeling you guys no what i mean,loose feeling and if you shake the controller it sounds like a baby rattle yeh that kinda cheap,also the thumsticks are awful they raise them up and make the surface for your thumbs smaller in diameter why,I dont know.Here's the deal if you only have so little to spend on a wireless controller this one isnt that bad but if you have an extra $20 dollars buy the controller made by Logitech!"

3,Best lousy movie I've ever seen!,"This movie is LOUSY! That's what makes it so much fun to watch! The gila monster is never shown in the same shot with the people he is supposedly attacking, the sheriff is a whiny, ineffective fool who couldn't solve a jaywalking case, and the main character, Chase, is so annoying with his ""goody-goodness"" and horrendously bad musical numbers,that you will relish the prospect of watching him get torn limb from limb by the gila monster (which unfortunately does not happen!). Having stated all that, let me say that if you like campy sci-fi you couldn't find a better movie if you raided Ed Wood's own personal movie vault! You'll savor every agonizing minute! Buy it now!"
