3,Beautiful BUT ...,This is a beautiful ornament BUT the faux pearls started falling off the FIRST time I went to take it out of the box ... you can glue them back on without much effort.
4,pretty entertaining stuff,"I bought this set out of curiosity alone. I have enjoyed other bigger budget Fox musicals like those made by Alice Faye and Betty Grable, but didn't know much about any of these titles. (By the way, thanks for releasing a better print of ""The Gang's All Here,"" which IS one of those big budget movies.) However, I was pleasantly surprised at the level of production and entertainment value in all the films, even in the black and white movies (""Doll Face"" and ""If I'm Lucky"", which haven't received the best Amazon reviews. Carmen Miranda is a joy to watch, a fascinating talent that certainly evokes a by-gone era of movie-making. She's great in Technicolor or black and white! This set is well worth the money if you are a fan of musicals of the 40s. The documentary was top notch as well."
3,Carmen Miranda Collection,"I have just viewed the first of this collection, and am amazed at how much I have forgotten since I first saw it, many years ago. Enjoyed watching her dance again. I cannot comment on the others, not yet viewed."
1,This scanner is the worst peripheral device I have ever used.,"Unfortunately, Amazon does not allow zero or negative star reviews, so a 1 star will have to do. I have never used a more infuriating, unreliable piece of garbage than this scanner. It works - for about five minutes, then completely stops sending and receiving data. Not only does it fail on a regular basis, it also makes horrible grinding and whirring noises to accompany its death throes. I have tried this scanner on multiple computers, and multiple platforms, (Ubuntu, WinXP, PCLinux OS) with no change in reliability. DO NOT BUY THIS SCANNER!"
1,"Only code, no explanation","50% of book contents are code listing, even resource files in xml. The explanation of the code and techniques are inexistent and the code comments are 50% of the total code lines but they are irrelevant, a representative example (page 183):// CH 7. Display the timedisplayTime();They present one program example that evolves accross the book, and they print the COMPLETE code of the modified files in every chapter. When you take out the unnecesary repetitions the book loses an important percentage of the pages.I live in Europe and the shipping charges are similar to the cost of the book, if I lived in the USA, I will return the book at once."
1,A Commercial Rip-Off,"I bought this book because Luanne is one of my favorite comic strips. However, this is little more than a commercialized rip-off of the strip. It occupied me for only three minutes because it's so short. In addition, what's here tends to focus on the cynical instead of the up-beat. NOT Recommended."
4,Gloomy but engaging,"A stripped-down solo effort by one of Freakwater's leading lights. As with that pioneering twangcore band's more clattersome albums, this is rough-edged and uneasy musicmaking; Irwin's mournful, mid-tempo approach doesn't vary much, and it doesn't invite the listener to take this is as simple entertainment... Irwin conjures the bleakness of old Jimmie Rodgers tunes, as well as the sincerity and humanity of the Carter Family (particularly on her version of their ""Will You Miss Me When I'm Gone..."" Despite the lack of singalong accessibility, this disc stands out as intelligent and well-informed countrifying, a dreary downer of an album, to be sure, but still more interesting than most. If you like Freakwater, then you oughtta check this out as well."
4,Muy bueno,"Muy buena novela histórica sobre la vida de Cipriano Salcedo en Valladolid durante la época de la contrarreforma.""-Algún día -musito a su oído- esas cosas serán consideradas como un atropello contra la libertad que Cristo nos trajo. Pide por mí, hijo mío. (Pág.462).""Altamente recomendada para quienes disfruten de una novela histórica bien documentada o tengan algo de interés en la época."
5,Great CD,This CD is amazing. I bought it for two or three songs and ended up loving the entire thing. I listen to it just about everyday in the car. All the songs are unique and appealing to the ear and the CD panflet has some nice eyecandy as well. BUY IT! :D
4,Worth the price!,"If you wnt to buy a Hips don't lie single, you better choose this one imported from Japan, the carboard edition is not worth it. Keep making good music Shakira!"
4,VERY GOOD BU T NOT A MASTERPIECE,"THis is a harsh, violent, incisive attack at the Marine Corps on Vietnam. Hasford's style is very good. In my humble opinion, he clearly tried to copy some of Erich Maria Remarque's technique. The book is totally focused around the narrator character. We ( the readers ) have absolutely no insight about tactical or strategic situation. It's a short book, so it's worthwhile reading. WOuld it be longer, it would be hard to stand it much more. Anyway, it's something to wonder why a book so good like this one is out of print..."
5,The Best War Book Ever,My Uncle wrote this book and Its a really good book besides that.I think this is the best book ever.
4,Sure Different From The Film,"After watching the movie ""Full Metal Jacket"", I had to have this book. It was pricey but worth it. The book is totally different from the movie. I will not ruin it for someone who wants to buy this rare book. So if you like the movie, buy the book, its a must."
3,Didn't really add much to the FMJ experience,"I bought this book in order to see whether it would add anything to how much I liked the movie Full Metal Jacket. Of course, the number one reason I liked the movie is that Lee Ermey was outstanding in his role as the USMC Drill Instructor. It is easy to see why he was nominated for an Oscar for that role that year. If I had not seen the movie, I probably would not have been interested in this book, depite my interest in Vietnam War literature. Because I think of the movie as I read this book, the book falls short of what I wanted, and what I wanted was actually more of Lee Ermey. The book itself is a fine read, but I took on a chance on it because I wanted more Ermey and not to attempt to find more of the Vietnam ""experience."" Had FMJ not existed, the book is a decent read in and of itself, but not worth the selling price. In sum, the book had no effect on me, and the movie is still the way to go."
3,"Self-serving book, adequately done","Seemed to me that the author had penned some eulogies, so felt that he was an expert on the subject. Yeah, it might have been helpful for the very first timer....but not for anyone who's done anykind of writing in their past.Only buy this book if you have never written anything but a check before"
1,Fogless mirror leaves you in the dark,"You can't see your reflection in this ""mirror"" -- you have a better chance seeing yourself on your faucet. Oh, and it fogs, as well. Horrible."
1,Terrible,"The 3X magnification is horrible. You can only make out your skin if your face is right next to it and then you can only see part of your face. Terrible idea fora shaving mirror, in the trash it will go once I get a replacement."
2,Disappointing & unfocused,"A while back I picked up Robert Pelton's absolutely fascinating ""World's Most Dangerous Places, 4th edition"". After reading his intrepid accounts of kidnapping in places like Colombia, I was intrigued & wanted to learn more. I bought ""Ransom"" expecting the same engrossing level of detail that W.M.D.P. provides. Instead, what I got was a patched together, overlong work that purports to give us the ""inside scoop"" on international kidnapping and instead is a series of chapters verging back and forth between fawning profiles of counter-kidnapping professionals (sans any real insight into what it is they *do*) and melodramatic tales of victims in Kashmir. I'm sure Auerbach meant well, but her book does not provide enough interesting information to be worthwhile; her style is overblown and windy, and her reporting is not up to par. If you're really interested in this subject, my advice is to save your money and pick up W.M.D.P. instead-- you'll be glad you did."
5,Read like a novel.,So many non-fiction books dealing with politics are so boring to read. I thought this book had the dynamics of a novel with the information of a textbook. I commend Auerbach for successfully marrying the two. This book is a must read for people who want to know more than the media reports about international kidnapping.
1,A Disorganized Jumble Of Disconnected Thoughts.,"This book is just a jumble of disconnected thoughts in incoherent paragraphs, each having nothing to do with any other. I was so excited to begin reading this book. Then, after reading 100 pages, I was so excited to throw it away. Please, please, please don't buy this book. Not buying it will teach the erroneous editors that let it pass, that people want something better for their reading."
5,Fascinating stories,The stories are captivating and emotionally rich. Anyone planning to travel to these countries should read this book. A well written book that I had trouble putting down.
3,poorly edited but a worthwhile read,"This book is a more than worthwhile read. However, I think it did not get the editing job that it deserved. At times, it is repetitive, repetitive, repetitive.Also, the author probably could have cut out some of the ""new agey"" stuff about the Norwegian hostage who was murdered. Finally, there is a faint but smarmy whiff of politically correctness in the author's vocabulary. I for one am not as sympathetic as she was to the terrorists in Papua New Guineau who murdered (by hatchet I think) two Indonesians just to give their Western ""guests"" an incentive to keep moving.Still...it is chock full of details, and there are poignant moments. I have a feeling it might have been a much better book at 400 or even 350 pages as opposed to well over 400 pages"
2,This book was thin and poorly organized,"The book had an interesting opening with the kidnapings in Kashmir, but this was followed by a considerable amount of poorly organized information that was often redundant and uninteresting. There some very spare descriptions of other kidnapings that I would like to have seen expanded, and the kidnaping the book opens with isn't resolved until the very end, forcing the reader to sort through quite a bit of entirely irrelevant anecdotes, statistics, and repetitive descriptions of the politics and mechanics of the negotiation process. I would only recommend this book to someone as reference and then only if the information wasn't available elsewhere (and I'm not convinced that is the case)."
4,What all women should know,"This is a very informative and well written book. However, I didn't know that this is not the updated version,which I would have preferred.There is much good advice in there, which I intend to heed."
4,Very Informative,This book is very detailed in letting you know about the pros and cons of Progesterone vs. Estrogen. I found it to be very informative and actually am following the progeterone protocol and am having positive results. It was just good to know that what I was going though was not menopause but perimenopause and its not such a scary word once you know what it is all about. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in finding out the truth about what estrogen (estrogen dominance) can really do to you if you do not get the correct info. from the right sources.
4,Important Information for Woman over 40,I am glad I found this book before I got synthetic hormones. I found affordable USP Progestorone Cream at OneLife.com (I do not work for the site OR a paid endorser) and it has helped me tremendously. I had a full hysterectomy a year ago and felt lousy until I started using the cream and other vitamins that assist hormone balance according to the recommendations in the book. It is very unfortunate that health insurance won't cover natural alternatives!!! No wonder the health system is such a mess.
4,Great read,This was among my favorite books as a child and now my sister and I each have our own copy. A delightful tale about a baby monkey who becomes a pet and the many escapades he gets into. Your children will love it!
3,Critical failure..,"Naqoyqatsi takes a wild ride with it's singular message, mixing painfully unrelated themes and seemingly cryptic imagery with a delightfully ominous musical score. The result is an overly ambitious film that's candy for the ears, but very complicated to follow.This film combines all the modern day genius from which one could expect a gem. Sadly, this film was a prime example of what happens when someone gets overambitious with a story or theme. The previous films were consistent enough that even the simplest minds could generate a theme from them. I couldn't even explain what Naqoyqatsi was about (besides the obvious man vs man struggle) to someone who was interested.I would hope its not the last qatsi film, I like them."
2,Don't bother,"This item gets two stars because it at least looks like the item picture and description. The material of the belt is just a really thin, plastic-like vinyl. There is no way to keep the belt tucked in place because there is not enough substance for the buckle to hold it down with tension. There are belt holes, but nothing to prevent it from slipping. I'm better off making a belt for my costume."
4,HELLO BANGOR MAINE,THIS BOOK WAS REALLY GOOD. I READ IT SEVERAL TIMES. I WAS THERE GREETING THE TROOPS. AND IF I DIDNT GREET THEM THIS BOOK MADE IT SEEM LIKE I WAS THERE. THE BOOK CAME TO LIFE. I AM GLAD I GREETED THE TROOPS AND READ THE BOOK. THE BOOK MADE ME THINK OF ALL THE MEMORIES I HAD OF GREETING THE TROOPS. THE BOOK BROUGHT BACK SO MANY MEMORIES.
4,A Seasonal Tale for Halloween,This little book was a quick read. Peter Straub's style of writing makes whatever story he is telling move right along (even if it's as convoluted and confusing as Dark Matter).I can't really talk about this book without giving away the story. All I can say is read carefully. I can mention that you will feel like you are there at the club listening to Hat perform. You will also feel like you are right there with Hat and his friend on that fateful Halloween night so many years ago.For a white guy from Wisconsin Straub paints a convincing picture of the life black people had in Mississippi back during segregation. I suppose that is to be expected from such an artful storyteller.Get this little book now and read it before Halloween for maximum effect. You will spend an pleasant evening though with it even if you read it in December.
2,Disappointed,"Racial line-crossing in Jim Crow Mississippi? This slight tale has it. Scared little kid, with very little to do with the cat on the cover? Check. Some fairly good paragraphs about jazz. Sure. Overall, though, there's not much here."
3,Nice to look at,"This book has a lot of cute pictures and things, but not too many recipes. It's very wordy in some parts and it lacks a clear, comprehensive description of the canning process. It's cute though... fun to look through."
5,Covers the Jam/Jelly Basics . . . and tasty too,"For the ""tips & tricks"" section alone I think this book is worth it for a novice. Though the book is also nice if you want a book that has a bunch of basic recipes. The photographs will make your mouth water and the instructions will make you feel that you can handle doing this. Each recipe is for ""small batches"" usually involving 3-4 cups of fruit.Each recipe I've tried has turned out delicious (about 8 so far.) I do wish there was an index, however the table of contents does list each recipe."
2,So badly written............,"I bought this on the strength of various recommendations, and after noting its much sought after status in the world of supernatural literary masterpieces.I have to say its literary style is appalling and the plot meanders in pitiable circles. Yes, there is a brief ""epiphany"" towards the end but by then I was tired of reading about the hero's ""horrors"". A real ""penny dreadful""! I should say that the Centipede Press edition which I bought, was a superb piece of book design and binding. Its not the misunderstood masterpiece that Colin Wilson suggests."
4,Excellent,"The Clique does the same melodic pop that Tommy James crafted with the Shondells.Many call this sunshine pop-but suger comes to my mind. The same light beats, happy melodies and farfissa organ used by Tommy himself.Hats off to these guys: they stuck to a working formula, and never went too far right like Gary Pucket or to a lesser degree, the Partrige Family. These may be silly little love confections, but the Clique keeps the music sharp and lean, almost proto-new wave for its ecconomical arrangements.Gimme that sunshine. Gimme that sugar."
5,Their best compilation available!!!!!!,"Along with some Tommy James atyle tracks.....also note the early BeeGee's tracks?? Also note the few bonus tracks from their very early beginnings.....cool stuff.These guys were truly a power pop act......had they stayed around longer......They had alot of similarities to Clevelands ""The Raspberries""..of the same era."
3,Cold Coffee you still want to drink.,"L'Amour: French Glamour Girls: Retro Nudes. is like cold sweet coffee the faces have a cold expression yet your eyes still fall in love with the exsotic recto feel. The photos are exsotic even sexy, This book is a good classic yet with indeviual style. a treat on most of the the 144 pages."
5,WOW!!! I got exactly what was stated in the description!!,I got exactly what was described and in the exact condition. Shipping was great recieved when promised!! Great Seller!!!!
4,"Yummy, simple receipes","Don't overlook this book just because of the dopey, disproven food combination garbage. This book is a gem, filled with wonderful, easy to prepare dishs, with lots of great ideas. For example, bet you didn't know that simply taking pieces of frozen cantalope and throwing them in a blender produces the most amazingly tasty shake. Yum. If the book didn't waste so much time with idiotic food theories, I would give it 5 stars."
5,Marilyn Diamond always delivers.,I have several vegetarian cookbooks on my shelf (I'm not a vegetarian) and yet over the years I haven't been moved to prepare most of the recipes -- too many ingredients or too fancy but I remembered how the Fit For Life vegetarian recipes were always good (a little bit of work but they were tasty) so I ordered this book and it is GOOD. Very good.
5,A triumph of Architectural Spirit,"This book served justice to one of the true master of our time. A triumph of architectural spirit over shallow trends and self-important manifestos.The book has almost no writing but with beautifully composed images of the architect's drawings, sketches, models, and photographs of finished building. Sometimes, an image is worth a thousand words, and it is really refreshing to see an architecture book that let the work speaks for itself.Format of this book is full of surprises. The book is about 8.5 in square with 228 pages, compact but not too small, and some of the pages allow you to unfold so the reader can experience his architecture with grandeur views."
4,Visually Stunning,"While the Architect's process is touched upon, the real stars here are the photos of the models and buildings. This book offers the reader a fine sampling of the public buildings by an architect with a strong personal style. Interior and exterior shots (showing context nicely) abound, and the model work is just stunning. Sure to fire the imagination of the architecture enthusiast."
1,"The only ""Predators"" are in the Capitol","Please I have had enough of these books full of tear jerking anecdotal stories. The undisputable fact is that a majority of borrowers who for whatever reason use sub prime financing benefit from its availability. I have been a ""predator"" for over 20 years in auto and home finance and I have many more happy and appreciative customers (I can write 100 books) than I do unhappy and dissatisfied clients (Thats how you stay in any business).My experience has shown me that more regulations only makes money less available for folks that have substandadrd credit or other circumstances that make them un-bankable, in effect diminishing the amount of choices adults have to run their own financial lives."
2,not as wonderful as I expected,"I am a mother of a 6 year old and a French teacher for grades Kinder through 2nd so I expected to get a lot of use out of this tape. However, the format is not one that makes it enjoyable for children to hear repeatedly. My daughter is much happier listening to songs rather than hear a far fetched story poorly acted. I would recommend the ""Bonjour mes Amis"" Videos instead as the vocabulary is more useful and the story includes real life events. Stick to song tapes in the car."
1,Big Disappointment,"I ordered this CD for my 6 year old and we were very disappointed. He begged me to turn it off, saying it was horrible - and he usually loves to listen to books on tape, songs and French in the car. The production values were weak, the songwriting insipid and the voices just plain irritating. In addition, when I sent this back to Amazon, they gave me no refund, so I've cut down on my once frequent purchases here. Great CDs for learning French exist, but Beth manners has no skill in creating one."
4,"Lydia, Queen of Palestine Review","The book I read was called Lydia, Queen of Palestine. It's about this Romanian Jewish girl, who's parents are devorst and she doesn't know it! Since German Soldiers were running every where, she went on a train to a community in Palestine. Her mother was going to be smuggled into Palestine later by a boatsman. This community is a fenced in place where everybody doesn't lock their doors or anything.Before all of this Lydia's father left for another woman. Lydia calls her ""That Woman"".When he left to go to Palestine he got papers to bring people where he was. He sent them to ""That Woman""There are more important things in this book, but I don't want to give them away.What I liked about this book was that it expressed how she felt. What I didn't like about the book was that the 1st chapter was disgusting. I thought it would be good for 3rd graders, ut as I got into it I thought it would be for my age."
2,Too much better competition for this one,"The good news is that the soloists are great and the playing is superb. But the bad news supersede the good ones.Nothing wrong with fast tempi, but this one is simply rushed. Based on Sir Rattles recordings, I think he is more marketing hype than a true great conductor. And his recent Mahler 8th simply proves the point.But the issue that frustrates me the most is not Sir Simon but EMI. Why is a company as important as this one still recording miserably after all these years? Carmina should be a sound blockbuster, but EMI refuses to improve the bass and give the ambience a broad span. Try a DECCA/London recording (from any year!) and you will hear what I mean. All these missed opportunities are mind boggling. Even small, independent companies (God bless them) have recorded better Carminas than this one."
2,This could very well be the weakest Carmina Burana yet,"Rattle's rendition of Orff's scenic cantata doesn't compare to the renditions from Jochum, Dutoit, Muti, and Welser-Most. Some of the speeds are a bit too fast (even faster than Jochum's choice of pacing), and the sound quality is below average (the bass sound is heard incorrectly). The orchestra and choir sound good, but it doesn't make up for the dreadful soloists. Pass."
2,My first Carmina Burana recording - but what a let down in accoustics!,"I would not have minded to review this disappointing recording but for the fact that I recently got another EMI and Rattle's recording (Shastokovitch's 1st and 14th Symphonies), of which the same problem surfaces.I know nothing about sound engineering, but EMI should account for some thing if in both recordings the listeners are being 'tortured' in their poor accoustics.Well, the performances themselves should not be so lowly rated. Considering the soloists - Gerhaher, Brownlee here, and Mattila, Quasthoff there - they certainly are top-notch.Can some one enlighten me on this aspect?"
3,DO NOT FIT!!,"I finally tried to install these on my car and they do not fit.I believe that they are for the rear rotors that are 9"" vs the front ones which are 10.5""(the reason I bought them).There is about a half an inch gap on both sides of pad when tiring to install these on my car.I DID check the install recommend tabs and it clearly stated these would work with my vehicle.I was a little disappointed but learned a lesson to try an install sooner than later.PLEASE remember they do not fit the front pad bracket of a 98 EX Honda civic w/o ABS.Now I have to sell these at a loss do to waiting and not being able to return them.Lesson learned."
1,Squeal like a stuck pig!!,"These PADS are no good. They have a ""brake in coating"" that squeals for the first 500-1000 miles. Mine still squeal even after that. The squeal is VERY LOUD, and it very embarrassing. If you search you will find many people have the problem.For such expensive pads I would expect them to be silent."
2,It's a Novelty Item.,"If you have Charles Atlas thumbs, you will love this unit. Otherwise, you might want to look elsewhere. The use of this product is awkward. It is very hard to push the igniter while engaging the child-proof switch."
1,not a good fit,This dog muzzle runs much smaller than described and did not even come close to fitting my medium sized dog.
2,not great,"it dont fit him well at all,,i tried so many ways to but this on my dog.but not a good fit.."
3,Secrets,This movie version was obviously censored. Therefore it rates only 3stars regardless of the star power of Jacqueline Bisset.
3,Secrets,This was an okay movie. The only reason I got it was because of the main star. I'm going to have to watch it again to see what it was about.
4,Good DVD at a great price!,This DVD is over 4 hrs long and does a decent job of covering the Fallen Flag Railroad during the late 1950's to the early 1970's. All of the chapters are narrated and cover a broad section of the US. Best DVD for the cost.
5,DVD,Great dvd for any railfan. Good photography and narration. Well worth the cost. It arrived when promised and the quality is excellent.
4,If you like trains,"If you like trains, this CD is ok. I thought it could have been a little better, maby I was expecting too much, but all in all worth buying. Good info."
3,"Intersting, but worth praise?","This novel may set up the phrase ""generation X"" to be used abundantly, now to the point of cliche, but for us to give so much credit to this book seems puzzling. The characters are slackers and I feel this story does little to show an improvement on thier part or a sincere care on the part of the author.This interesting, as a history of how the phrase grew to cult status, but it is difficult to label this a great book."
5,Can't put it down,"This review was dictated to me by my 10 year old daughter. ""Robin is a really good book. I could not put it down when I had to. It was sad and you really wanted to keep reading it."" The first book is Blackjack followed by Frosty, Rusty and then Robin. It is good to read Blackjack first and the rest in order. Annie and Rimfire come after Robin but are not important to read in order."""
2,"Wasn't that nice, baby?","In July 1965, a recording session was scheduled for Elvis Presley's next movie,Paradise, Hawaiian Style. Elvis didn't show up for the session, claiming he had a cold. So, the musicians and the backup singers recorded the tracks without him. About a week later, Elvis showed up and recorded his vocals to the previously recorded backing tracks. This is one of the weaker Elvis albums. It has more novelty songs than any other Elvis soundtrack. There is a total of one good song, which is ""This is My Heaven"". It is a very short album, with only ten songs. But this CD adds a whole lot of alternate takes to bring the playing time up to almost 70 minutes. The alternate takes are actually more enjoyable to listen to than the actual album, since you get to here Elvis joking around and laughing at how bad the songs are. You don't need to get this unless you are a hardcore Elvis fan (like me)."
2,"Paradise ""HIGHwai'ian Style","HIGH price, = near $3.14c per song; ain't heard it yet, got the VHS, my favorite song: A Dogs' Life, only in this title, but $30.00-for a CD? It's from the U.K., NOT DREAM, it's DERAM, one subsidery of the London/DECCA group. Since the movie was shot here, in Hawai'i, O'ahu/Honolulu, I'll take a guess that the U.K. CD may be in STEREO, so fake sound. No information at CDNOW>divide the $30.00 + outlay, and it's only 10 tracks = near $3.50 per song. Due to online lack of CD information, mono/Stereo, I'd suggest: buy the VHS. Some nice on site pictures showing the 1960s' Honolulu on O'ahu, now deleted from the island of O'ahu. It was nice here, the video shows the way it WAS. Price WAY too HIGH! *2 Stars* too High a price!I started in musicology from 1954. Any Q&A; <apa_musica@yahoo.com>"
2,Did nothing for me,"This did absolute nothing for me. It did not reduce my stretch marks at all. Didn't make them worse either! But I would not recommend it as I think it's a waste of money, unfortunately.."
5,Divorce Education for the parents of children divorcing,"This is a very helpful book, well researched & well written. It's organized in such a away that you can skip over parts that don't pertain to your situation. Parents need to read this book if your child is goign through a divorce (or thnking about it!) Bottom line: the author helps parents learn/realize what their role should be as parent/parent-in-law/grandparent when a child is going through a divorce & how to stay strong and sane for not only your own good but also for your loved ones! A must read."
3,sturdy but not very comfortable,these are very sturdy but i could feel the metal in them. feel o.k. for a while.
3,useful but boring,"This is a useful book, but it is quite boring. It could have been written in half the pages. I agree with an earlier reviewer that it is wordy and repetitive. You have to be patient to find a new idea buried under a pile of superfluous and redundant paragraphs. But it is insightful nonetheless. If you work in R&D, then you must read this book to see which model is suitable for innovation."
2,"repetitive, blathering","Earlier review got deleted... hmm. Anyway, this book was a short paper that got blown up into a book, but they forgot to add anything except empty filler. The few concepts are nothing novel or interesting either."
5,Fresh thoughts on innovation in a story-telling bottle,"Andrew Hargadon is the intriguing intersection of a mechanical engineer, an industrial psychologist and an innovation story-teller. His book ""How Breakthroughs Happen"" will lead you across the junk piles of the IDEO industrial design firm -- he really worked there! -- gunnery improvements in the US Navy in the early 20th Century, and the origins of cubism. As this eclectic assorment of examples accumulates, a breath-taking theory of innovation begins to emerge, which Hargadon calls Technology Brokering. By the time you reach the more personal epilogue at the end, you realize the man is right. Innovation is an eternal recombining of what already exists. He goes on to outline an eminently practical process which eclipses traditional odes to maverick invention and other empty invitations to revolution or disruption."
2,mediocre,"While I found the concepts in this book quite interesting, the examples become redundant very quickly and the writing style left me unimpressed."
1,Disappointing and Boring,I had high hopes for this book. There are too many parts that feel self-serving and pointless. I felt like I was reading the author's autobiography rather than reading a book on innovation. The material on IDEO could have so much better from a content perspective but it stopped short of providing practical information to the reader. I found the preface by one of the author's former professors to be the best part of the book. I would not recommend buying this book.
5,Really good in office reference!,"I found this book to be a really good source of info - both as student and now as a working optometrist. It has good, concise descriptions and the 2-page layout per condition is excellent. The photos are really good for explaining diseases to patients in-office. Easy to look up what you need due to the A-Z scale on the side. This is a book you will actually use in your career. Highly recommended!!"
2,good condition but out of date edition,product was in better than described condition but old edition ( not indicated in item description) and had to be returned; service was very good
5,"Good for New Scrapper, Better for Advanced Scrapper","This is a very good book for any level of scrapbooker with lots of good, basic information on color theory and layout design. I think a beginning scrapbooker can get a lot of good information about how to create a layout - but this book does not discuss how to organize photos, journal or create an album - so it is not a good ""how-to"" book. I would try the Scrapbooking for Dummies, etc. series if you want to learn how to scrapbook from a book or look-up a local Creative Memories consultant. This book is better used to inspire and trouble shoot. I often refer to this book when I am working on a layout and something is not quite right, but I'm not sure what. Reading this book usually helps me figure out the best color schemes to use or how to establish a focal point for my layout. In addition, the layouts are really good, with up to date product lists."
2,not as pictured,I ordered this 6-32 tap based on the picture. I needed a tap with a larger base so that my tap wrench could hold it without slipping. It turns out to have the same narrow base as any standard Home Depot type tap and was absolutely worthless for my purposes.
4,Great Appearance-reasonable quality,"The 'look' of the watch is high end, even in person. I was a little disappointed in the band, as it's quality is lower than that of the watch. We took it two three places before we were able to get a jewler to adjust it."
3,Good Watch - Bad Comunication,"The watch was shipped quickly, functions well, and looks good. My only problem is that it is difficult to snap the band. I'm hoping it will hold-up and not break. I emailed WorldofWatches who sold the watch on Amazon to ask about the problem with the band -- and they never-ever answered back. I think that is a very poor business practice. Very, very poor customer service.I would recommend the watch to those looking for a classy, automatic watch...but you might want to buy from another merchant."
3,"Nice watch, shame about the strap","I got this for my mum. It is a nice watch, weighty, nicely crafted and keeps decent time with a classic Seiko 5 mechanism. However the strap, while looking great in the picture is cheap, light, and a little uncomfortable (sharp edges).I am going to replace it when possible."
3,SEIKO WOMENS WATCH,THIS WAS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND...PERSONALLY I LIKE A MIDSIZED WATCH AND PREFER A BLACK FACE BUT SHE LIKED THE WATCH VERY MUCH....THE TWO TONED BAND IS NICE AND IT WAS PRICED REASONABLY..****UPDATE***** THIS IS AN AUTOMATIC WATCH (MOVEMENT WINDS THE WATCH) THE PERSON THAT OWNS THIS WATCH IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE AUTO WINDING MECHANISM...WATCH IS NOT KEEPING TIME
2,Seiko automatic watch,"The clasp on the watch does not work. Brand new out of the box. I can contact the watch company if I want, but the price of shipping will likely cost more than a repair at a shop.The watch is sold through Amazon, but not backed by them. Will NOT buy from Amazon again. Quality control seems not important."
2,Helpful to some but not to us,"My son has OCD and this book was recommended to us by his therapist. What it basically suggests is fighting all urges to preform the compulsions induced in the mind from OCD. This is a task that is probably the most obvious thing to try to get your child to do when you are a parent of a child with OCD. You hardly need a book for that. If your child is an otherwise reasonable individual, this book may help, esp. if they are willing to read the book themselves. My son is not and none of the strategies suggested to him did a bit of good except increase his stress level."
5,Excellent,Excellent book for parents of a child (no matter the age) who is struggling with OCD. Gives good insight and tips for helping your child along the path to wellness.
3,Not so helpful for non-specialists,"Not so friendly to the non-specialist reader, as it was very ""medical"" rather than written in a way for everyone to understand. More theoretical and loosely structured rather that practical. Seems to have accurate - but probably too much for a beginner - scientific information, though not in a way to be used directly to the reader's benefit. Layout a little tiring for the eye. Maybe more useful to someone who is deeply involved in the study of OCD, e.g. therapist."
4,This book about Shipwrecks is Not a Wreck!,This book is one of the most enjoyable books to read on the subject of Sunken Ships and Lost Treasure. The information included in these 450 plus pages is varied and useful. The reading is easy and the additional information boxes sprinkled through out the text are humorous and informative. I find this book to be useful to the first time shipwreck enthusiast and to the person who wants to find out more about shipwrecks and treasure. The background stories are interesting and presented in a way to keep your interest without going to deep. There is a complete glossary as well as links to internet sites on the subjects covered.
3,Estroven,"I was happy with the price until I realized when I got the product, that you had to take 2 a day. So the price was not that great after all."
3,is this the real stuff,I just hope this stuff is not conterfeit. I might just decide to send it to a labratory just to be sure. I really do dislike being misled.
5,Odyssee Fantastique,"This compilation contains a vast array of french emcess and crews, dropping some of the purest hip hop gems. L'Odyssee du Rap consists of tight tracks ranging from the militant, hardcore sound of Ideal J, to the socially conscious ragga style of Neg' Marrons, to the oriental-influenced Shurik'n joint, ""Samourai."" Definitely pick up this disc if you are new to french hip hop or simply looking for an album, which compiles tracks from some of best crews de L'Hexagone. This album contains singles from groups such as IAM, Fonky Family, Assassin, Minister AMER, Saian Supa Crew, and many others. Overall, this is an incredible compilation."
5,Sublime,"Chocolate to the ultimate degree. THE bar for those who want the pure chocolate experience with a miniumum of outside interference. Dark, rich, bittersweet, and packed with theobromine. Perfect replacement for prozac in your medicine cabinet."
5,This is the best band ever from upstate New York,"Those of us who grew up in western New York in the 60's are blessed with memories of Wilmer and the Dukes, the tightest soul band of the decade. The rest of the world will have to be satisfied with this CD. Long ago I wore out my LP. Thanks for the CD."
5,Great sound from a vastly underrated group from the 60s,"The single ""Give me one more chance"" was a classic. One of my favorite songs of all time. It was about the only song we heard from them out here in Arizona. The Cd was great as I got hear a lot more from this great group. Made me wish that I was back east at the time."
2,Gravion Good Gravion Zwei Awful!,I'm gonna try too keep this short because its really not worth a long review. Gravion was a fun anime with great characters and great music and a well thought out storyline that was spread out well. I gave it 4 stars. I waited patiently for Gravion Zwei's complete release hoping it would finish well but it didnt even come close. The writing was horrible and the way they spread out the story between episodes was even worse.The first 5 episodes were filler and they really needed that time for the story because they failed miserably when they tried to put it all together later. Its just a shame Gravion ended this way. I will probably sell the first season now. You might be asking why 2 stars instead of 1? The animation was done well and it was the only thing better from the first season.
3,"So far, not so good","I have only seen disk 1 so far, but I can't exactly say I like what I see. Sure, there's lots of fan-service. Sure it's got some funny points. But the plot! I haven't enjoyed watching a giant mech show since I watched Voltron 20 years ago (ok that's dating me) and I was the target audience when I watched that; 7 year of boys. This show has all the cheesy things that I hate about the genre; combining robots, cheesy phrases, the main character calling out the name of each attack. Now, if you strip out the 5 minutes that they actually get into the Gravion, then you got a pretty good show. They didn't botch the American voice acting either. Only problem; I've never seen Gravion and this is Gravion Zwei (or 2 in German). So there is a lot I think I am missing as far as plot is concerned. Now, all things considered, was it worth the $25 I paid in the store? Yeah, it probably was. But I wouldn't want to force anyone this that has already gone through puberty to sit through."
1,"yeah, but guess where he got it from......","three words: AUSTIN OSMAN SPARE!AOS came up with a sigil-magick system waaaay before 1978.seek out the various websites offering information, heck check out the Yahoo! group by the name of Austin Osman Spare's Zos Kia Cultus.yeah, dig it."
2,Sophistry,"One of the few books I could not finish.Have it in the hall.May try to read again.Nothing great apparent.Also,the current asking price is disgusting.The sellers are delusional."
2,Not empirically-supported,"This book does a good job reminding everyone to focus on the positive in youth who are so commonly caught in negative interactions with parents, teachers, and peers. However, the author is not an ADHD researcher and ignores decades of empirical research about ADHD as a neurodevelopmental disorder and ways in which ADHD heightens risk for poor outcomes continuing through adulthood. It is unfortunate that some families will read this book and not realize, just because the author has a PhD, that she is not a scientist in the ADHD field."
3,A good reference for beginners,"It's a small book meant for quick references. The topics covered are not extensive, but are helpful if you need ideas to compose a simple letter in French."
3,"Nice journal, but not super.","This journal is nice, but would have preferred a soft cover so that it would look and feel more like leather. It does look nice, and I like the way it closes."
4,good not great.,"I've only used this once and it was on fondant. The letters don't want to line up straight so you have to make sure and ""wiggle"" them around before you press it. The punctuation stamps didn't fit in the holder and it fell out. Definitely helped for a beginner though."
3,wilton press kit,got trhis for my daughter. she said she thinks she is really going to like this. since she is just starting out with cake decorating
5,great garlic butter dipping bowls,"work great for garlic dipping bowls when you serve seafood, and for ketsup, salsa, veggie dressing dip, other sauces"
3,"Some magic, some sleeping potion","I was looking for more of the remarkable 12-string guitar playing found on ""I sing the body electric"" (Weather Report), and there is a bit (although I suspect helped along with some post-editing with Melodyne or equivalent), so good; but other things are a little too new-agey for me. So, worthwhile but not uniform to my taste."
4,UPLIFTING AND TOUCHING,"Based on a true story, THE STAIRCASE is one of those uplifting Christian movies heavy on morals and faith, and thanks to an intelligent script and very good performances, it works.Barbara Hershey gives a smooth and touching performance as Mother Madeleine, a dying nun who wants to see the completion of a chapel in the Santa Fe territory before she dies. This seems impossible when the architect ""forgets"" to put in a staircase to the choir loft. Without the funds necessary to complete the staircase, that dream seems unlikely...until a mysterious stranger named Mr. Joad shows up out of nowhere and offers to build a spiral staircase with no charge. CSI's William Petersen gives a strong understated performance as Joad, whose mission becomes both a blessing and a curse as the original contractors (David Clennon and Justin Louis) don't want Joad to do the staircase. It may all play out with predictable results but it's sincerity is so genuine, it's a fine little film."
5,The most awsomest movie ever,"This movie teaches you faith, trust, and kindness. Even though Mother Madelyn is dying, she puts her faith in the architects to build her a chapel but they forgot to put in a staircase and has no money for one to be built. A man comes out of nowhere and builds one for them for free. as mother madelyn's dying wish Is to see the chapel finished. It is a heart-reneging movie that I recommend you should see. It changes you forever."
2,Folding Travel Mirror,I was disappointed with my traveling mirror. It was much smaller then I thought it would be.
2,This is not the tab book to get,"While some of the songs are tabbed with a certain degree of accuracy (by that, I mean the positions on the fretboard that Yngwie plays them), the overwhelming majority of the songs will not be physically possible to replicate even at half speed if you go by the way the songs are transcribed in this book. Meaning no disrespect to the transcribers, they've tried to transcribe the solos using ""the box method"" as much as possible. Yngwie uses linear lines, going up and down the fretboard.There are plenty of other books out there with much more accurate transcriptions than this. Search Amazon, ebay, craigslist, etc. But save yourself some money as this book simply is not a useful tool."
5,Malmsteen 101,"I recommend this book to all guitarists who wish to challenge themselves. As far as Malmsteen tabs go, this is the best there is. It is really thick and gives you both the musical notation and conventional fret numbered tabs for each line of music. Some fans may not like that most of the songs are conventional songs with verses and chorus and an interlude followed by guitar solo, but I think it is the way to go. Flip around, learn an arpeggio here, some chromatic spiral over there. It is fun for any guitarist who likes the way Malmsteen does it and is willing to sit down with a music stand. Here's a tip. When you play on the higher frets don't use your pinkey"
5,"Episodes, actor bios, notes & highlights, EVERYTHING! (:","I love this book basically because I'm obsessed with Party of Five, and I love the pictures and finding out how the actors and actresses feel about the series. and the episode guide is great. This book rocks!--em"
4,Essential but expensive extra for a travelling Mac,"This is a typically elegant Apple take on a standard part. This thin, light weight battery has LED lights showing the charging status even though the Mac OS also has a very informative indicator of charging time remaining on the top right menu bar. It locks on with a coin or strong finger nail slot twist by a quarter turn. Don't leave home without a fully charged spare battery even though in heavy use I get about 3 hours."
2,A Dumbed Down Version of Robin Hood,"To the poster before me: ""you must ignore that the money was ill gotten"". Really? The whole premise of this book is steal from the rich and give to the poor. Are we so desperate for a socialist nation that we are now presenting these ideas to our children as good morales in their children's books?My son brought this book home from the library and both my husband and I are disgusted with it. We've had numerous conversations with our son (6 yo) about it. He asked us one day ""isn't it ok because the robbers ended up being nice guys?"" I asked him ""if they truly wanted to be nice, what should they have done?"" and his response was ""give the money back."" I'm glad to see my son understands the true meaning of what's right and what's not. I'd say this book ranks right up there with ""The Rainbow Fish"" as socialist propoganda."
2,It wasn't the best of her work,One Wicked Night was just OK. The lead characters were really rather 2 dimensional and the constant misinterpretation between the two was a bit much. I wanted to be done with the book maybe 2/3 way through. I made it to the end and even that left me flat. I guess there was just nothing there for me to latch on to and care about.
1,Not helpful at all really....,"So I purchased this product and used it faithfully for several weeks. It definetely stung the first couple of times I used it, but subsequent applications didn't seem to irritate or bother my udereye area. This product did tighten and pull the undereye area so I used Bobbi Brown Undereye Balm at night over the Vita-K to help moisturize. Well... here I am several weeks later and I can say that the darkness under my eyes has changed; however, it changed to a bright pink that is not easy to conceal and the skin is very irritated and patchy with very dry areas. I have discontinued using this product and am just waiting for all of the side effects to heal themselves so I don't look like I have scaly skin anymore. I think I prefer just trying to conceal the original dark circles. Glad it has worked for so many. As for me... I have packaged the remainder of the Vita-K and am returning the product for a full refund."
2,Meh,Have been using as directed for several weeks now with no significant results. Does practically nothing for hereditary dark circles. You're better off sticking to cucumber slices and ice and saving money.
2,Nope,"I used this cream for three weeks, two times a day and it did make some part of my circles lighter- from brown it went to pink. But I skipped one day and it all went back. You pretty much have to be tied to it and keep using it two times a day."
2,Stings and that's all,I found that this product produced little results and it mainly just stung the undereye area.
2,Vita K under eye dark circle review,Product did not clear up dark circles. It did help to firm. But the dark circles are really my concern and I can not afford expensive remedies
1,"Didn't work for me either, unfortunately....","I used this product faithfully for 2 weeks and it turned my bluish purplish dark circles to a far more noticeable hot pink/reddish color. It occasionally burned, and caused my eyes to water like crazy. Too bad..."
2,doesn't actually remove dark circles,"This item doesn't actually remove dark circles,it just tightens the skin around your eyes.It also stings.Not worth it!"
4,All-in Fighting by W. E. Fairbairn,"An interesting overview of self-defense and hand-to-hand combat techniques taught during WW2. W.E.Fairbairn is one of the authorities on the topic from that time period so that in itself makes the book worthwhile. I can't recommend the book as a ""how-to"" book but it is an excellent reference text and has historical value."
4,Important work.,"Elizabethan history is much less popular than the Shakespeare plays, but the more one can learn about that history, the more one can see into the meaning of the plays, whether or not their authorship is in question. Streitz provides much relevant detail about the early lives of Elizabeth, Oxford, William Cecil, even Henry VIII; his theory of the Queen's parenthood of Oxford is strongly supported. Many problems in the plays are plausibly explained by reference to the lives of Oxford, Cecil, and the religious/political problems faced by the English during Elizabeth's reign. Obviously, this is a bigger story than one book can cover in complete detail. Streitz has made a very good start on re-telling what must be one of the biggest scandals in European literary history."
3,Shakespeare by Another Name,Try Shakespeare by Another Name first... And the Wives of Henry the XIIIth and then go back to this one.
1,OXFORD,"I purchased this book after seeing the author interviewed on television and reading the reviews. I cannot understand the number of 5-star reviews this book was given. The only plausible explanation is that they were all written by Mr. Streitz himself. Whether or not Oxford was the son of Elizabeth I is irrelevant. This is one of the most poorly researched and poorly written books I have ever tried to read. I finally gave up after the third time he told of event that probably happened, but for which there is no proof yet, stating that sometime in the future ""someone"" should do the research. No, Mr. Streitz, that someone should have been you, and the time to do the research is before you write the book.Bottom line - unreadable drivel."
1,Oxford: Son of Elizabeth I,"Rife with factual errors, this self-published attempt at scholarship is worse than embarrassing; it is unintentionally hilarious: Queen Elizabeth, Mr. Streitz claims, was both mother and lover to Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. He offers nothing at all in the way of evidence for this assertion, nor does he offer any evidence for any of the other silly claims he spouts in this silly book. Furthermore, he cannot write, he can neither spell nor punctuate correctly, and his syntax is ungrammatical. Shelve it under 'Humor.'"
1,Complete Insult to History,"The fact that someone could even fathom the ideas in this book is disturbing. As a huge fan of Katherine Parr, I am rather insulted that this author would even suggest that Seymour got Elizabeth pregnant. This whole theory is rather ridiculous and is another product of Victorian scholars. I am rather disgusted with this book and the fact that it is being used as a source for people to further the idea that Elizabeth had all these affairs and pregnancies, when history clearly says otherwise, it's disturbing. It's almost as bad as believing ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and the fact that Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth's mother, actually had a tryst with her own brother! Honestly, if Elizabeth had become pregnant by Seymour, Seymour would have been executed on the spot by either the Dowager Queen or the Regency council and Elizabeth would have been imprisoned! Unbelievable!"
3,"Good carrying case, some flaws","This is a sleek black leather case for the HP iPaq rx1950.However, the design does not allow the unit to charge in the cradle charger. A slight curvature of the back leather would have been thoughtful.I also don't like the non-removable metal insert of the belt clip. It makes the unit mildly uncomfortable when carrying without belt clip.Otherwise, nice design with storage card sleeves, and all of the required case openings for Mic, IR, Charge port, Headphone jack, soft reset, and record button."
3,Hmmm...,These were both good stories but that's really all I can say. Both the stories in this book just left me wanting more especially since the descriptions of the stories were very enticing to me.
5,A GREAT READ!!!,"This book is about a girl named Chasity Pureheart who has been on the run for as long as she can remember. Every time she moves to a new town, she picks the first girl name out of a book in the library. She's finally settled into her town when unexpectedly, her mother runs away on her 16th birthday. Now Chass has 6 days to uncover her past and find out her real name... and discovers a murder on the way.I love to read. I got this book and scarfed it down in 2 days flat reading for periods of 3 hours at a time. This is probably the best book I've ever read!!!"
5,entertaining with the sopranos,excellent service very happy with delivery time and items arrived in excellent condition will buy again
4,Do not buy this for a cookbook....,You will be disappointed if you buy this book for a cookbook. It does contain some great recipes but few of them. The photographs are great! The book is about the Soprano family and how they entertain. It is written as if the Sopranos were a real family and is funny at times.
2,Dissapointed,"I got this as a gift and registered for it for I was pregnant with my daughter. This was the biggest mistake. The canopy does not cover my daughter when she sits in it. To make it recline, is a chore. My husband has the hardest time to unfold and fold it up, not to make fun of him. he only noce thing is the cup holder comes out to make it easy to take her out. But even still it is not a good purchase and do not buy. We did however buy the peg-pergo piko full size stroller even though it is a littl but more money. Well, worth it. I would suggest that and we also have a macleran light weight stroller and that is also very good."
3,Circuits Are Not My Friend,"I found that my instructor took the easiest parts of this book and just created a class out of them. While looking through the book out of class I found it harder to understand than just looking at my class notes, which in turn made doing the homework out of the book all the more challenging. As a beginner in the work of circuits I have to say I'm not a fan of this book, but I did get some useful information that I couldn't easily find on the web."
2,Not that good,"Honestly, this book covers all the topics, but doesn't explain techniques on problem solving some of the circuits. The examples are not that well, and the author leaves our many steps in the worked out problems.Buy this book if ur not in an electrical course, and just want to read the theory behind it. But not if you want to learn to work our problems on top of the theory.There are books out there that do well in both aspects that I have discussed."
2,ph Miracle for Weight Loss,It wasn't so much as I didn't like it as it was that I was very disappointed that it was not the new version.I did not relies I was getting the outdated book.
2,Just Another Diet Book,"I found this book to be just so much hype, another treatise on why we're fat and why that's bad. Just so much hoodoo and hoopla. I wished I'd saved my money and gone out to eat!"
5,the ph miracle for weight loss,"This book is very informative about how our bodies are supposed to be alkaline and how putting so many acidic foods in our bodies causes inbalances that can lead to all kinds of health problems. Talks about how to reverse an acidic body, become healthy and lose weight. Very realistic before and after photographs. Not models. Makes a lot of sense and is very easy to read. Has great recipes as well. Very important book"
2,Too Complicated,"The concept is very interesting, but by the time I read all the things I couldn't eat I was beginning to wonder what, if anything, I could eat besides drink water and a special kind of water at that. The recipes were way too involved and had ingredients I have never used and a lot I didn't recognize. Maybe I'm just too simple, but I need a simple plan otherwise I give up."
4,Full of info,This book is easy to read and offers great suggestions to good health.I would definately recommend reading this book to get healthy- NOW
2,Disappointed,"My opinion is the food plan will work but this book is not laid out well. I found myself going back and forth trying to locate the info I needed. The book refers to info in previous written books which I do not own. This info should be included in this book! The first 4 chapters tend to cover the science aspect of the diet...For me a simple statement would do since I don't have any interest in the rest or even understand most of it to be simply honest.Moving ahead...I did begin the cleanse process, only using 1 of the supplements suggested...(taking herbal lax's 3 x's daily is not healthy in my opinion so I chose not to use that portion of the cleanse) I did lose 6.5# my first week.Even though I have had success with the cleanse part of the diet, I am disappointed in the book as a whole."
2,MAKES SENSE BUT..............,"While I understand the science behind this book and have no doubt it will likely work, it is impractical for the average persons life style. It needs to be easier to work into a working persons day. I also appreciate the fact that information is given on other products and supplements etc. which would assist in the process. However, I find that purchasing their products though seemingly not necessary, to be an extraordinarily expensive investment. The prices they charge are not for the average consumer, so use subtitutes if you are going to do this, and buy from your local health food store. Examples would be to pass on their pH drops and use baking soda. In fact if you don't have money to burn pass on their products period!!!!!!!"
5,Weight Loss Miracle,"In his book, The PH Miracle for Weight Loss, Dr. Robert O. Young presents compelling information directed at the cause of weight gain. His information is fresh, and makes practical sense. He points to the harmful physical effects of acids formed in the body, resulting from foods that have been eaten. He also demonstrates how maintaining an alkaline balance in one's systemThe pH Miracle for Weight Loss: Balance Your Body Chemistry, Achieve Your Ideal Weight, promotes weight loss. The information in this book empowers readers to take charge of their own health destinies. After reading this book, everyone will know what foods help, or hinder wight loss and good health."
2,makes extravagant claims without backing them up,"The testimonials are certainly compelling. Lots of people have apparently lost a pound a day on this diet. Not too hard to believe when you consider that you eat only vegetables.But Young makes some statements that seem completely unscientific. For example, he says that when bouncing on a mini-trampoline, ""your cells will expand and contract."" I'd like to see that under a microscope. He also says that sodium can convert into potassium in the body. Again, no sources are listed as proof.If I'm going to spend all the time and money is takes to do this diet, I'd have to first be convinced that he knows what he's talking about. Too much of it reads like a sales brochure, not a scientifically sound program."
4,Good book,"The book arrived promptly. I have not fully read the book, went straight for the food lists and to the store. The ph diet is helping quite a bit. My husband, my grown kids are doing it with me. The first week we all noticed the increase of energy from the food change. We've lost some weight, but for us it's most important to eat well for our health. Recently, I ate carbs and non-list items (acidy foods) which I would eat everyday, and I felt woozy, shaky and wanted to lay down! My husband had the same experience when he ate acidic foods as well. We will continue with the diet. I would have to read more on the book, and do the exercises outline. Highly recommend the book, but also highly recommend several books to read on the subject and make an informed decision on what is best for you."
1,Not a good Kindle Book,"About half of this book are recipes, but they are indexed by page number -- which refers to the print version of the book. There are no hyper-links or other means by which to find the recipes. It is impossible to use. You would have to ""next page"" endlessly to get to a recipe. The print version might be a good book -- the first part was interesting -- but the last half is USELESS as a Kindle book. Better to buy the print, and hey publisher -- you can't just take a book and format it for kindle, especially when it references page numbers continuously. All in all, I feel that maybe the whole program is a scam... it's obviously about selling books, not about selling useful books. NOT RECOMMENDED."
3,The PH Miracle Diet,"The pH Miracle for Weight Loss: Balance Your Body Chemistry, Achieve Your Ideal WeightExcellent book, arrived in very good condition. It is a good way to address changing one's eating habits t o the healthy live diet."
4,Does what it says - but not as quickly as it says.,"I was skeptical but at least for me, this has made some real improvement by fading tiny spider veins on my legs. However, I didn't start to notice any change for at least 1 month (about one tube's worth) and I applied it religiously 2x a day. By the second month (and second tube) I only had to apply it 1x a day (usually at night) to keep the faded areas from re-appearing and I continue to use it on darker/problem areas with a gradual lightening effect. I suspect this wouldn't help you if you had very large spider veins or vericose veins but to catch small ones when they start and keep them from getting worse it seems to do the job. Beats surgery too!!!"
5,The best Damn Anime!!!!,"I saw this movie about right when it came out. I saw it for rent and I thought I liked the cover but I had no idea what it was about. At first it seemed like a sappy love story with some of the supernatural world in it. But damn, after seeing it a second time I fell in love with the characters. They stand out from normal anime. I saw the movie first then I probably spent over $300 buying the entire series fan-subbed. Then the first movie ""I Want to Return to that Day"". Although sort of a casual anime fanatic I've seen almost everything I could think of and this is the best Anime movie I've ever seen. Buy it or whatever. but I recomment reading up on the series first. You won't regret it!!!"
4,muzzle,I like the muzzle but just found out its to big i think they need to have a better sizing but all in all its a good product
5,SnowMobile Dolly,Product works great. Solid construction. The channel in the middle is nice for the carbides to set into and keeps the ski from slipping off the side like others. Can't even by the casters for the price of the product!
3,Dolly,"These are typical Chinese made products, they arrived in typical fashion paint raised and what seems metal pitting under the paint.As they are not going to be used outside, I won't bother returning them and the problem is finish/cosmetic and does not intefere with the use of the product.As for function, they do allow for mobility on a SMOOTH surface and two people guiding the sleds as all four wheels are rotational, bigger wheels would allow better mobility.As for use, you must put one under each ski and under the drive belt, which requires lifting the sled and sliding the dolly under, a heavy sled makes it more difficult putting the rear dolly under the belt, so be careful.These are useful products and do as they are meant to do within the guidelines above, as for quality they are made in China."
5,Best snowmobile dolly set ive used,"I would recommend this product to anyone that is in the market for a new dolly set for your snowmobile. Arrived very quickly, came in an official Raider dolly set box, and took 5 minutes to assemble/ with very simple assembly, anyone can do it. Don't go blow $60 on a set because this one will work just as good. It works great, easy to roll around, saves my back from hurting, and its a a decent price! It is very durable, and NOT cheaply made.Buy this now if you need a set!"
5,Heavy duty,"I just started a job that requires me to do vehicle services out in the field. I had smaller strap wrenches that just did not hold up. This strap wrench is a brute. I have almost cut filters in half because the person before me put them on too tight. I have a 16"" long 1/2"" ratchet and a 20"" pipe on the end of that I works every time."
1,UGH....,"I tried to use this stuff for my old acne scarring and for other discolorations in my skin(tried to get an even tone all over). This stuff doesn't work! It's very drippy and runny, and you have to use it like three times a day(who has time) and you get way too discouraged because you don't see ANY results until months later! I didn't see any at all! Buyers beware!I do realize every skin type is different, but this product just didn't do too well for me, good luck!"
2,i got the wrong amount,"I orderd this because it was the 3.6oz i recieved the 1.2oz...well i didn't refund it because i already started using it. Anyways it doesn't work to well, i guess on newly formed scars it fades away faster but old scars, doesn't do a thing."
4,good mouse,"I liked the mouse in general:* good optical precision* mouse wheel does not click - it is smooth and noiseless* wired so no hassle with battery (but I have a problem with that, mentioned later)* size is right for my handBut a couple of minor flaws prevent me from giving it a 5 star:* the wire is just too rigid - it is sometimes awkward when I move the mouse and the wire just gets in the way. I have another mouse with a flexible wire and I never have similar issue.* the button at the side by default move web page forward. I'd like extra one to move backward."
5,Geat little mouse!,"I've found over the years that I prefer the small notebook mice over their full-sized brethren, even for use with desktop systems. But I'm also a bit frugal. So when I purchased a new desktop that came with a generic full-sized mouse, I went shopping on Amazon for a notebook mouse with low price and high ratings. I finally decided on the Microsoft Notebook Optical Mouse 3000, and I have not regretted that decision since. It works well, and the feature I like the most is also the feature that some people dislike the most: the smooth, silent scroll wheel. From now on, this will definitely be a feature I look for in a mouse. The only negative (for me) is that like a lot of notebook mice, it has a rather short cable (about 30""), which makes it problematic for use with an under the table desktop system. Of course, a USB extension cable can fix that problem. Overall, a great, little affordable mouse."
1,Where's the software and customer service?,"Very disappointed in what I received as my order. I purchased two of the optical mouse 2000s and received nothing but the mice.....no software....no box, just two loose mice wrapped in bubble wrap in an envelope. I teach special education and these are to be used for two students who are visually impaired. I wrote the company at the email address on the packing slip twice and received no response. I've been waiting for the request to review in hopes the software issue can be resolved. A customer should be told if they will not receive all necessary parts of an item."
3,Cord gets in the way,"The USB cord on this mouse is very stiff, and since it comes folded there are already many bends in it. The cord seems to really get in the way no matter how often I try to straighten it out. The price is good and the mouse works great, but the cord is a bit overwhelming for this little mouse."
1,Doesn't work w/ WIn 7 ?,"I have a wireless mouse, the old style, that I've had since my XP desktop machine & it worked just fine when I got my new laptop (win 7). This one doesn't? I figured all mice were compatible if that one had no problem.Now they'll want more to ship it back than it's worth. I won't buy from anyone but amazon anymore due to return policies; and I doubt I'll ever buy anything online that I haven't already owned or I can't test out first in another way."
3,It's okay.,"Both my siblings bought the same mouse beforehand, and it seems to do the job. So I decided to get one myself. This mouse is smaller than an average mouse, but it is the perfect size for my hands. It did not take long to install the mouse onto my laptop for recognition (no CD is required). I use it for gaming and surfing the internet. The mouse works great but I do notice that zooming in on pdf/image files and scrolling on websites is a problem. I would have to manually click and drag the zoom in button on my files in order for it to zoom it. My mouse doesn't seem to want to zoom in when i use the scrolling tool. I guess I can deal with that, since I don't use that function often."
2,It's a Mini Mouse!,"Good Mouse, but it's Very small!! So it is very difficult to use. I didn't notice any clear indication that it is a small mouse."
2,The CD and thumb button is not useful,"I use Win 7 but this mouse is only certified for Windows Vista. So, the CD does not work and I cannot install the software required(even in the compatibility mode). The thumb button is of no use. Otherwise, this mouse is okey."
5,Love this mini mouse so much!!!!,Cool design and comfortable touching with this mini mouse~ blue light on the back of the mouse is really cool!! I love it so much`
2,I DON'T like it!,"Reasonably priced & well performing, it scrolls well with the scroll button and has smooth ""mouse-action"" on all surfaces I've used it on. It fits comfortably in my hand & I rather like having a corded mouse that I'm not constantly replacing batteries in. My husband's favorite mouse so far & I'm ordering another for our other laptop. I definitely recommend it!UPDATE*** I recant my further recommendation, as this little mouse broke in about 4 months - blah!"
1,I like this mouse but it does not last.,"This mouse is comfortable and worked well for six months. It was a practical companion to my netbook. I like it enough that when my first one stopped working, I bought another one. Now after seven months it has also broken in the same way. On both mice the cord frayed at the USB connector and the mouse eventually ceased to work.For this price I would expect a product to work for at least a couple years. I am going to try a wireless mouse that is about the same price."
1,Uncomfortably Too Tiny for my Small Hands,"This mouse is wayyyy too tiny. I'm a short guy(5'6) and my hands are not that big. The mouse is uncomfortable for its tiny size. Oh and I use Photoshop a lot, so I do a lot of mouse clicking."
3,XtraSmall Mouse with high performance,"Good mouse for a Notebook or keyboard with USB connection 2 foot cord is just not enough an extension is required for most desktop situations...but otherwise excellent reaction sensitivity...click wheel needs a break in period, new tilt wheel is a little awkward and CAN get in the way sometimes...rubber bumps (grips) on the sides seem unnecessary as theres not many times im holding onto my mouse for dear life but anyhow, i wish i could turn off the annoying BLUE LED on the back (palm area) of the mouse its VERY BRIGHT and always on...you can see it from across the room, really..the new SMOOTH scrolling wheel is cool some wont like it though...nomore clicks while scrolling...."
2,"Everything is fine, BUT the wheel is very bad.","Maybe because of the settings, maybe because it's a piece of c***, the wheel brings me up before going down, very surprising...I like the size, the optical is cool, the button and design great though. for a decent price."
3,Works well but smaller then expected.,"Works well but smaller then expected. When I ordered it I thought it would be larger, but it works well and fits in my bag when traveling."
2,Sssooo small,"It's functional but it's small. I bought a slightly larger mouse Logitech V100 which feels a lot better, more comfortable, responsive."
2,Comically small,"I ordered this mouse because I love the other Microsoft optical mice I have, which are both wireless. Nowhere in the product description does it warn customers that this mouse is about half the size of a normal MS optical mouse. I opened the mouse and didn't even bother using it because it is so absurdly small. I would have to hold my fingers in an awkward claw-like grasp and contort my thumb to be able to use the buttons on this thing. Amazon wanted $8.50 to return it.If you have a child, this mouse might be great. If you are a grown man, do yourself a favor and skip this one."
3,Nice mouse but its smaller than I thought it would be.,I should read the specification more because when I received it the mouse was very small. It felt odd using it. It did work as intended. The magnifying glass software was sort useful to play around with. I ended up trading it for a mouse that was bigger.
5,Great laptop mouse,I'm contant with this laptop mouse. It's big enough where I can use it for work (photo editing) and not become tired. The construction is solid (doesn't feel hollow) and the accuracy of the optics is superb. I'm also not a fan of Microsoft but they do make great mice (computer mouses?). I'm looking into buying its bigger brother for my PC. (Microsoft Comfort Optical Mouse 3000)Highly recommended mouse for notebooks at a great price.
3,Not for 3D modeling programs like Maya,"Good as a generic mouse but will not be good for 3D modeling programswhere you need the middle scrolling/clicking function.The middle scrolling on the mouse locks up a lot and is extremely hard to use.Would not recommend for people who need a middle scroll function.I love the design and feel.I am a girl, so I really like how small it is, also it makes it easy to travel with.It's a very good mouse if you're not using it for the middle scroll wheel.I would recommend the Razer Deathadder for fellow artists in digital fields.It is a bit more pricey, a bit bigger, but still feels nice and works awesomely."
4,It's a good corded mouse,"It's so hard to find a good corded mouse nowadays. But if you travel on planesyou can't use your wireless mouse, and I hate trackpads.The only real issue I have with this is the scroll wheel gets sticky over time.The other thing is I prefer a click scroll wheel over a smooth one but I knewthis was a smooth scroll before I bought it. I still prefer a scroll wheel withdetents. The fact that it's sticks from time to time is it's only real drawbackand I use this mouse all day long.It's great over most any surface and I use it right on the laptop itself when Itravel and the laptop surface is solid black!I will likely give this one to my wife and buy a new one for myself. She doesn'tuse the scroll wheel at all."
4,Love this big little mouse...,"I've been looking for a optical mouse forever that I didn't have to pick up and slide it to get it moving. This mouse does an awesome job and moving a great distance on the monitor without big movements with my hand. I borrowed this mouse from my coworker when we were traveling for business and am hooked. It's light and precise, and perfect for my needs. I've bought 3 of them, one for travel, one for the work office and one for the home office."
4,Seems good so far!,"I have had this mouse for a few weeks now, and I didn't realize it was going to be a mini-mouse, but that's okay. It suits my purposes of gaming and graphic design. I like it!"
1,Much too small,"Mouse isn't wide enough, forcing my pinky to move in closer then it normally does. The buttons press down much too far then needed. Scroll wheel doesn't click, which is extremely annoying. Also the drivers/software for OSX is rather buggy, I can't change the scroll speed. I would suggest looking else where for ""the perfect mouse""."
4,Great LITTLE Mouse,"Gave this item four stars as it is a bit *too* small to be totally comfortable.It is indeed made for notebooks/laptops (as the description says).It is a great (little) mouse. Accurate, smooth and easy to work. Oh, and the priceis GREAT!"
3,Nice economical mouse,"Mouse is small and works ""ok"". I went through about 3 logitech wireless optical mice already. They were pretty expensive and worked great, but didn't last very long. Only got a few months out of each of them. After that, I decided to try a cheap mouse. Functionality and comfort can't compare to the more expensive ones, but I guess you get what you pay for. Scrolling is a bit jumpy, but other functions work well. If I take price into consideration, I would give it another star."
3,Not for gaming!!!,"This mouse is light to the touch and isn't very responsive so gamers in need of quick response and reliable handling look else where. This has great features with the scroll and zoom features, it is fine for surfing or basic work."
5,Works fine for me and my Dell!,"I got this in case I needed more features than just the touchpad. I use it with my Dell Inspiron and it works just fine. It is much smaller than a regular mouse and is great for packing away in a laptop bag or case.If you want a mouse for your laptop, this one will work fine, but if you are a more frequent user and want a better mouse for a desktop or a laptop, I suggest getting the Logitech MX400. It is a great mouse and I doubt I'll use any other mouse again.Logitech MX400 Mouse: Logitech MX400 Performance Laser Mouse - 9316380403 / 931638-0403"
3,Smaller than expected & not a true 5 button mouse,"Size of mouse: 2"" w x 3.5"" l x 1.5"" h. Too small for my tastes.Also, there is only 1 side button bringing the total count to 4."
2,"Great Service, but...","Shipping was timely and excellent, but the ring itself is less than satisfactory. I bought it for a friend, hoping that it would be a good gift for her-- and even though the silver is nice and shiny (though it does feel kind of cheap), the fit comfortable and smooth, I'm returning it because the ""blue lapiz"" sticks out like a wart. The picture makes the stone look more embedded into the ring... it's not. It sticks out for more than a good quarter inch, and has a scratched, imperfect surface. Just NOT aesthetically pleasing!"
3,Nice but needs Page Numbers,It would have been nice for this book to have page numbers. Hard to go to the page my professor tells us to go to when I only have locations. Would also be nice if with the Kindle PC App we could zoom into the pictures and maps and have them nice and clear. Other than that it is very nice.
3,no wkbk,"textbook came in new condition, what they fail to mention is that there is NO mapbook shrinkwrapped with it. check with your school before you buy this this make sure you don't need the workbook for class (my teacher actually assigns work out of it). If you just need the textbook then this is a great deal though."
3,"It's OK, but it definitely could be better","This CD was exceptional. The lyrics were sung pretty clearly and the music was lively and upbeat. I enjoyed how some of the songs talked about something other than break-ups, sex, or violence (some of the most common music subjects). However, there were a lot of parts that I didn't enjoy. Such as, I thought the lead singer didn't sound that good in my opinion. I guess maybe my expectations were too high, since I only listened to a few songs before buying the CD."
3,Some of the songs were bad; some good.,"I thought the CD was OK. Although I didn't like all the songs, most of them were excellent. All the songs had pretty good lyrics that were sung clearly. I also enjoyed the melodies and rhythm. They were lively and upbeat. Definitely dance-a-ble. What I didn't like about some of the songs was how the lead singer sang. He didn't sound too good in some of them, in my opinion. But for the most part, I really enjoyed listening to Flaming Embers. I totally recommend it."
5,This is great for flu and cold season,"I use it every time I get a viral infection. Shortens the duration and severity of symptoms. Great when you first feel like something is coming on, to knock it out!"
4,"Great knife, but be careful!","I bought this knife for using it on fish fillets, it works great! But by some unknown reasons the manufacturer decided to make upper sides of the blade almost as sharp as the lower part, so be careful it cuts as it the blade itself.."
5,The Foundation of Mexican Music,"The Son is the foundation of all Mexican Popular Music. In the Huasteca, the Son is known as the Huapango, in Vera Cruz it is the Son Jarocho, in Oaxaca its the Chilena. The Son is known by many different names throughout rural Mexicobut at its heart, the Son is the fusion of Spanish Music with Indian and African influences.The Anthology of Mexican Sones was compiled by Mexican ethnomusicologists in the 1970's and 80's. They travelled the backroads of rural Mexico looking for performers of traditional music. These researchers were the Mexican versions of the Lomaxs.This Anthology is best collection of Mexican folk music than be found in one place. These albums are filled with powerful performances. This collection is difficult to find. If you are lucky enough to find it, purchase them right away and count your good fortune. You will not be dissapointed. I own nearly a thousand recordings of world folk music and this collection is my all time favorite."
3,Japanese,"The only reason why I gave this book 3 stars was because I am in love with the anime series ""Inuyasha"". It would have been way better if it came in English instead of Japanese."
4,A great Christmas album...,"I love Christmas music, and I'm a big fan of the Haven Quartet, so I'll admit my bias on the front end. However, I think that any fan of a cappella music will absolutely love this recording of 13 traditional Christmas tunes, given the special Haven treatment.It starts with a soothing version of ""Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring,"" in which the singers provide a smooth accompaniment to Bach's stirring melody. There are some standard quartet arrangements and some more unique offerings. And their version of ""Lo, How a Rose"" is nothing short of glorious.There are probably a few songs that seem over-arranged due to a difficult transition to the a cappella format, which keeps me from giving the album five stars. Nonetheless, it is a stellar recording, and I would highly recommend it to anyone. It's one of the first Christmas albums that I listen to each year, and it is played heavily each Christmas season in our house!!"
5,Important piece of historical work.,"This was very important for me as my father, who is now deceased, was one of the medics on board the aircraft. Information on him that was unknown to me was brought to light in the book. It is well written and i am thankful that this piece of history that involved my father was recorded for the future."
5,Amazing story ! well-documented and very interesting to read,"Even tho I knew the outcome of the story, it was attention-grabbing and demanded that I read each chapter to understand the entire ordeal. The text is easy to read and the photos are very clear, though it is too bad they didn't pinpoint Bari, Italy on the map. I would definitely recommend this to nursing groups, WW II buffs, and anyone who wants to know ""how it was"" in the war zones. This is an especially timely release,as there is an excellent, brief history of the Balkans which explains part of what is happening in today's news. Short and an easy read, it will be a good book for reading groups. Especially any that include a mix of ages, for a better understanding of the WW II efforts."
5,"Amazing, truly, amazing!","Mrs. Mangerich, I was moved, ok, maybe I'm a bit partial, but I loved it... Mrs. Mangerich, my grandfather gave me this book, you know your cousin, I thought agh, another war-story. But I got into, drove my friends nuts talking about it, i loved every aspect of the story. The drama, and the way the story was written was beautiful. I was impressed, truly, especially considering I'm only a teen and you managed to captivate my impaitent mind... 5 stars all around, I hope to see you @ the family reunion!"
5,50 years ahead of its time,"Actually it was Chapter 19, but who's quibbling?In this book Jack Douglas, intentionally or not there's no way to know, blended several streams of American humor, Catskills-style one-liners and Benchley/Thurber nonsensical sophistication, among others. It doesn't always work, but then if go back and read Aristophanes now he's not always funny. Comedy is about today.In addition, the book was 50 years ahead of its time in the way it handled its comic material. Go read it, you'll see.If somebody writes a history of American humor in the 20th Century, and they leave out this book, they're a schmutz. (whatever that means)"
1,lame and boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,buy something else instead wwe is lame and weak i can see why no hardcore wrestling fans came back to watch this pg rated kiddie show
1,WWE PULLED A CURVE BALL WITH FALSE HOPES!,"This Royal rumble by far is the worst ever!!!!(meaning the rumble match)The hype of Y2J 3rd Return on his favor to win, But nothey pull a bad trick out of the bag.a lot of wwe fans upset, As of myself and my brother,who is a fan of the wwe.LAME, TASTLESS, AND UNPROFESSIONAL.NO COOKIES FOR THE STORY LINE WRITERS,YOU GET NOTHING!! But Vince I still respect you.Even PATRICK BATEMAN WILL AXE YOU FOR THIS."
2,Thai Instant Coffee,"I purchased this product in the hope of being able to make Thai Iced Coffee at home without the need of going to a Thai restaurant to purchase it. It didn't taste anything like restaurant Thai Iced Coffee. The absence of cardamon, a key ingredient in Thai Iced Coffee, was evident. It tastes more like a poor-quality mocha latte. The only positive thing I can say is that it wasn't as sweet as restaurant Thai Iced Coffee, which I always dilute with milk. Anyway, I didn't like it; but it was worth the try."
2,Not worth the money,"I did not feel this book provided anything that the new real life entry level investor needs.I thought this would be informative information that would have real value, but instead got a collection of stories. It was like a collection of stories to help the investors that have already made it, but not the real stories to prevent the everyday small investor from making the entry level mistakes."
1,Waste of Money!,I am a real estated investor and have read numerous books on the subject. This is one of the useless ones.
2,"Fun bathroom reading, but you won't need to take notes.","The book isn't horrible, but it is LITERALLY 101 two or three paragraph stories that people emailed or wrote to the author that he prints. No heavily structured knowledge here, just a bunch of people telling their horror or lemons to lemonade stories.Don't be fooled by the title, the investors in the book are not giving advice, they're swapping war stories. You can find plenty of these on real estate investing forums on the web for free.See if you can get it used.For some real estate books with substance, I suggest the following. They are full of great info AND often entertaining:Landlording: A Handy Manual for Scrupulous Landlords... By Leigh RobinsonStart Small, Profit Big in Real Estate...andInvesting in Fixer-Uppers : A Complete Guide to Buying Low, Fixing Smart, Adding Value...By Jay P. DeCimaSecrets of a Millionaire Landlord by Robert Shemin"
1,When the pieces don't fit,"I was so excited to get this just in time for my sons birthday. Sadly, it was a mess. None of the pre-cut pieces fit together, and when i tried to hammer the nails into the wood, all but 2 bent. He is so disappointed that we have to send it back. Money poorly spent."
3,trop romantique,"after going through a total french baroque obsession and listening to nothing else, this was my first non-french CD for several months. it totally sounded like chopin in comparison to rameau and lully and all the composers of the courts of the louisses... from that perspective, it was an interesting and enjoyable experience. don't be put off by my 3-star rating. i only give 5-star ratings in the event of an immaculate orgasm (i.e Angela Hewitt)."
2,Someone get an editor!,"There are some nuggets of wisdom in this book, but the author makes the reader work hard for them. I listened to this book on audio, so didn't have the option of skipping all the repetitive parts. (OK, we get it, actions speak louder than words. Does it really need to be said in each and every chapter?) I was disappointed that much of the insight to be had concerns how to find an appropriate mate. I'm happily married, and found the author ignoring me for entire chapters. There's a fair bit of rambling. Often I couldn't remember which ""truth"" we were on because his digressions bore no relation to the chapter title.I'd recommend this as a library book; you can get the wisdom out of it in a hurry and not be burdened by it after you lose interest."
3,"Not terribly uplifting, but very honest","I found the book to have some good points to think about. This book isn't one I'd go tell people to get, but it was a good one to listen to on my way to work everyday. It will make you think."
1,"The Author is Too Soon Old, Too Soon Dementia","This author writes off Attention Deficit Disorder as being a ""diagnostic fad."" Here is a quote from his book: ""A currently more common example of a diagnostic fad is adult Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Disorganized, daydreaming procrastinators now have a medical explanation for their inattention...""This is totally absurd, and is like calling blind people fakes. This is the kind of dark ages mentality that for years have been demeaning sufferers of this devastating disorder.One of the causes of depression for A.D.D. people is the abuse they are subjected to from well-meaning, prejudiced people, like the authors of this book."
1,"Too Light, Too Much Ego","THIS IS FLUFF. THE GUY IS NOT ONLY FULL OF HIMSELF BUT PEDANTIC, EGOTISTICAL AND HAS NEVER READ ALICE MILLER REGARDING HOW CHILDHOOD TRAUMA NEVER HAS 'IT'S TIME LIMITATIONS'. HIS THEORY THAT ANY KIND OF THERAPY CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH HIS ONE QUESTION of, ""WHAT's NEXT?"" IS SOMEONE WHOSE NEVER BEEN THRU TRAUMA, LOSS OR GRIEF. HOW HE GOT PUBLISHED I'LL NEVER KNOW."
1,What's the point?,"I'm not sure why this book was published, as it doesn't contain anything particularly remarkable beyond one person's pontificating about life's hard lessons. I would like to be paid to spout my unremarkable opinions in a series of essays. Moreover, I find it annoying that the author, a psychiatrist, characterizes ADD as a ""behavioral problem"" that provides ""relief from responsibility"" and calls adult ADD a ""diagnostic fad"" that provides ""disorganized, daydreaming procrastinators"" with a medical explanation and stimulant drugs. It made me want to throw the book across the room. I wonder how he treats his patients who suffer from ADD, which is not a ""pattern of behavior"" as he calls it, but in fact a neurobehavioral developmental disorder, the evidence of which has been seen in scans of the prefrontal cortex."
5,How to have a joyful life full of purpose,"The minute anyone realizes good intentions just don't cut it, that it's only actions that make me ""me,"" life is immediately more fulfilling, more challenging, more fun. The difference between a person who becomes who they want to become, and a person who doesn't, can be found in their willingness to take real steps every day. Want to be someone who speaks another language? Get a book and teach yourself. Want to be the kind of person who is appreciated and valued at work? Review your work ethic and your interactions and make positive changes. Want to be healthier? Actually exercise every day instead of just planning to do so. The world can tell who you are by how you act, and if you don't like what it's seeing you're the only one who can fix it. In addition, realizing that the people around you aren't who they say they are, but who they act like they are, is a lesson I wish I'd been exposed to and had been able to comprehend in highschool."
2,Nothing special,"I really wanted to like this book. The idea of learning life lessons from your elders is very appealing to me and I assumed that a psychiatrist would have even deeper insights to pass on. However, Livingston's book didn't live up to its title. There were some small nuggets of wisdom but you had to really focus to find them. I found the 30 essay titles completely confusing because they never seemed to have anything to do with the actual essay. It makes you think the essay is about one thing but then it's about something else entirely. And even within the same essay the author skips from one topic to the next so often that you have to go back to the title frequently to remember what the essay was supposed to be about. Unfortunately, more often than not, there was no connection between the two and the main point of the essay was completely lost on me. There are much better books out there on the same topic. This is not a book I would recommend."
3,Chicken Soup for the Soul ... but Missing a Few Noodles,"Dr. Gordon Livingston, psychiatrist, imparts his 30 pearls of wisdom in this short pithy book. He has had his share of suffering and scar tissue. Within a 13-month period, one of his sons committed suicide and another died in an accident. Plus, the guy got run over by a riderless snowmobile while standing in a lift line. Talk about ""bad things happening to good people""!My main misgiving is that each chapter seems to consist of preachy platitudes, verging on gas-baggery. The tome of the writing was off-putting to me, but I may be in the minority.Like most forms of chicken soup, taking it won't hurt and it may actually help."
2,Bon mots with no structure,"This is the kind of book that friends give you, because it will be ""good for you."" Most readers will find a section or two that ring true with the kind of advice you've always wanted to give yourself. But the book is a hodge-podge: Part autobiography, part tales from the consulting room (of a practicing psychiatrist), part devastating memoir of the agony of a parent losing sons in untimely death. In sum, it lacks structure and an overall purpose and one has the sense that it was more enjoyable to write than it is to read."
1,Of very Little Use to Me,"I purchased this book on the suggestions of the other reviews written and was extremely disappointed. If you're in therapy I think this book will help you. However, if you're the type of person who takes responsiblity for your thoughts and actions then this book steals about 2 hours of your life. There are much better books out there for you to read than this....Trust me on this one."
5,GREAT little book!,"GREAT little book... Very inspirational. As for the "" thirty lessons"" consider it as a Birthday Gift for someone turning 30! Wish I had read it then.It's true that it is basically things ' we already know' , but chock full of them, and very thought provoking.It does not disappoint ."
5,A Welcomed Delight!,"I spotted the book on the shelf at our local book store. What drew me to it was the title-an old and wise addage. My husband and I have read it together and we've both picked it up individually to go back to sections that speak to us personally. It is a small book in size, but it's packed with wisdom, understanding, authenticity and a reminder that we humans are all in this game of life together - and isn't that a wonderful thing! I am now ready for Dr.Livingston's other two books and we intend to give these as gifts to special people in our lives in the very near future. Thanks for the opportunity to express this. R. Melville-Burns"
2,Just Read the Chapter Titles,"Just read the chapter titles. The whole point of each section is easily summed up by the chapter title. The author's illustrations of said titles get removed from the original point. In some instances, I was even left with a feeling of forlorn, as in his illustration, he doesn't provide useful information to change anything you do wrong. He just states what we do wrong with an anecdote, and what he's learned.I'm not any cooler."
5,Learn it or lose it,"I'm an inveterate reader of self-help books, not all of the genre, but enough. This book summarizes a lot of self-help in a realistic manner. My favorite line: The statute of limitations has run out on things you suffered in childhood. That's a nice kick in the butt for anyone who wants to settle into the ""I can't help it, I'm a victim"" mentality. I found it useful but because of prior reading experience, repetitive."
5,Livingston,This was a wonderful book with many thoughtful issues to think about. Covered many issues we all have trouble dealing with.
4,Lifes Lessons in a nutshell,"I enjoyed this book, very practical advice. I didn't always agree with the author but his viewpoints were well defined and elouquently expressed. The reader can feel the author's pain and loss in many of the pages. The forward by Elizabeth Edwards was particularly interesting and refreshing to hear from a ""new"" voice."
4,"If you want to know the truth, read this book.","I loved the catchy title of this book ""Too Soon Old, Too Late Smart"". I bought it as an eBook for my Amazon Kindle and it is both hilarious and timely. A small book and can really be read in a single sitting...then you can read it again and relax and study it. The Author of this book makes you feel you're not so dumb after all! Chapter seven, ""Be Bold and Mighty Forces will come to Your Aid"" should be read first...it's wonderful. Gordon Livingston, M.D. is the Author, and you should really read it!"
4,Wise lessons,Great little book about great life lessons. Anyone can benefit from the wisdom written in its pages. You can pick whatever chapter is appropriate to your situation.
4,Biotin Shampoo Review,"I used this product years ago before it became unavailable at beauty supply shops. It is not quite the same as it used to be, but I like it still and am satisfied with the results. I will continue to purchase it as long as it is available."
2,Don't plan to buy again,"This shampoo is alright, but I don't plan to purchase it again. It smells nice and cleaned my hair well enough, but didn't do for me what some other reviewers claimed. Maybe my hair loss situation is differant, but I did not feel like it lessened any by using this shampoo. I also did not feel like it made my hair stronger, thicker or healthier.The solution is rather thin and watery. I had to use much more of the shampoo than I use of most other brands I have experience with. The bottle did not last as long as I expected since I had to use about twice as much as expected. This is not something I would recommend to friends."
3,scalp buildup,"This shampoo leaves my hair wonderfully shiny and healthy looking . It does feel and look thicker and my hair is no longer falling out even though I am still on a low carbohydrate high protein diet. But after a few weeks of use, this shampoo is leaving a buildup on my scalp. I will have to try another biotin shampoo."
4,Simple to learn and quick to play.,"I've been playing this game since 1979 and although other games have come and gone or changed the way that they are played, this one stays the same. A winning classic! Rich W"
1,What happened to the rest of the movie?,"I purchased this set and returned it without even cracking the shrink-wrap.The back of the case states that the Magnificent Seven is 88 minutes in length.However, the theatrical release and the version that I have on DVD is 128 minutes in length.MGM cut out 1/3 of the movie!"
2,From Back Cover,"Writer Melissa Sanders never dreamed she'd wake up to find a handsome stranger beside her...and a ring on her finger! Blame it on the rum cocktails, but after one wild night in Cancún, she suddenly had a husband! In a panic, she took the first plane out of Mexico, vowing to put Tony Bond out of her mind...though she knew her body would never forget his touch.Two years later, Melissa has written a sizzling book based on sexual tricks she's done with her ""husband""...tricks she still longs to do. She even dedicated the book to him! But when Tony shows up for her book tour, ready to play the devoted spouse, she doesn't know whether to kill him -- or kiss him. Especially once Tony makes it clear the honeymoon isn't over..."
3,Decent magnifying glass,"It does seem reasonably durable but it was dropped the first time, a piece of plastic broke off. I can easily glue it back on, but expected several more drops before any damage. Other than that, the kids (I bought two magnifying glasses) love them. For the price, once we destroy these, I'll probably get more unless I can find one more durable."
2,Magnifying Glass,I was disappointed in this item. I did not realize it was considered a toy. I am having trouble with my vision and needed the glass to help me read. The lens was scratched easily.
1,Vita K solution,I used this over priced prouduct for 2 months and i did not see any results!!!!!!!! AT ALL
1,Terrible product,"I've been using this thing for about a year, and it just sucks! I tried to be as patient as possible, and that's as far as it gets with this thing. I saw no improvement at all. Total waste of money and time."
3,its okay,"I can see my stretch marks getting lighter on my legs but it takes awhile. Ive been using this fir 5 months, so it's definitely a patience thing. Also I changed my eating habits and exercise 5 days a week so thats made a difference as well. Yea I definitely think diet and exercise helped. Plus I just started using nivea good bye cellulite gel-cream."
2,Don't bother,"You could make your own! I bought these through a catalog for my 3 year-old last Christmas. He pretends they are leaf-blowers. If you find the ""sweet spot"", the tones are okay, but finding that spot isn't easy. Too much money for not-enough product."
2,BARELY HEAR THE NOTES,"I bought these for two blind children who are interested in music but was really disappointed in the sound quality of the boomwhackers to be honest. One needs to find the perfect place to whack them and then the sound is so quiet that its barely noticable - not worth the money at all!! Steer clear - or as other reviewers say, make your own rather!!"
3,We had fun,The sound wasn't as good as I expected but my family had a blast playing Jingle Bells on our heads for Christmas.
2,Not as musical as I had hoped,"I purchased this toy for a 4 year old and hoped he would enjoy it with his older brother. It became something to bang with- on everything in sight! However, not much music ensued, and thus, I was very disappointed in its musical or educational value."
2,Ehhh...,"We are a very musical family, and these looked really neat online. We ordered them as a gift for our children a while back, and while we were all happy with the quality and basic idea, the sound was too muffled, or quiet. We 'whacked' them on anything and everything we could find, but they were never satisfying to any of us. I suppose we were expecting a much fuller sound. They went to the Goodwill."
2,Product presentation confusing,"Product presentation confusing, is not the set of bearings.Just bring an item to the end is very expensive.It should present a single bearing, which is what really sent to the buyer."
3,Need an air valve.,The way to get this to 5 stars is make it a threaded schrader valve so you can hook an air compressor to it. Its kind of pointless the way its designed but it serves the purpose in a pinch.
4,The Story of The Enforcer of the Al Capone Sindicate,Lives up to the story of the true Frank Nitty. Its a good item for those collecting gangster films.
4,Fourth Time Around,"The fourth figure of Saesee Tiin is one of the best ones yet. Unlike the statue from the Power of the Jedi line and the Action-Posed figure from the SAGA line, this Saesee Tiin can be put in a lot more poses. The only problems is it's missing a robe and the face is a little too white. It's more poseable than the Clone Wars version, but not as detailed. Overall though, a great figure."
3,About 3 And a Half,"When I was a kid, I was a Jimmy Wang Yu fan. But some of his own movies he directed were to outlandish. this one isn't like that. There are some very good scenes in this movie. One in a restaurant they really worked on this. And he looks like he really hit some of those boys! Lao Leih is in this one as well. While he doesn't make you believe he is a Karate man, he is always a good villain.A few really good parts is when Jimmy sticks Low in the stomach with his fingers then pulls them out, looks realistic. I have to say I'm glad I own this one. Its a classic and one of Jimmy's better films. Get this one for sure."
5,YUM,"Yes. This book was my first entrance into pie making. Between the ""never-fail"" dough recipe and the many delicious pie making options, I tell you, I have swooned groups of friends and strangers alike with the deep-dish apple crumb pie. Unbelievable. Everybody thought I had been baking for years... Come summer, I whipped out the Farmhand's cherry pie, and oh my goodness, the party throwers I gave it to never got a slice! The entire pie vanished they never got a chance to see it! It was just that good... I highly recommend these delicious homemade recipes. Obviously a lot of delicate care and fine tasting went into creating these spirit-enhancing gifts of wonder."
5,How to Ace your 3-D Design Courses,"It would be unlikely to find this level of expertise in the fundamentals of 3-D design even on the university level. Professionals will appreciate it if within their area of interest, but all right-brained thinkers would find this an easy means of grasping the mathematical laws governing the basics of formal 3-D design (not an easy thing to do.) This of course, provides the springboard for the elegant inspiration the book illustrates.I find this book a valuable and significant resource for my library, and look forward to reading Wong's other publications. Thank you."
5,Good!,This is a wonderful reference. It is quite readable and presents good useful material in succint fashion. A great graduate-level textbook.
4,Cool!,Great idea nd it does octave the Boomwhackers! They also serve as cups to do watercoloring with etc... so thats an added bonus!!!
5,Everything you need,Everything worked great and fit perfectly. Great price for everything you need to replace a rear end. Used on my 90 GMC K1500.
1,Poor quality,"The jaws were more like a parallelogram than a ""C"" and would make it difficult to hold material. The parting line on the clamping surface had not been ground down and would leave an impressed mark on clamped material. I returned the two I ordered and do not recommend this ""C"" clamp."
3,Beginning of his Monkhood,"This third volume of ""Buddha"" covers the very beginning of Siddhartha's monkhood. So far this is one of my least favorites of the series. Many of the chapters have nothing to do with Siddhartha, but with other characters. This is nothing new, the first volume only had a baby Siddhartha at the end. But, unlike this volume, the first volume's separate parts add up to an over all narrative.Many of the messages of Buddhism are present, but take a backseat to what can only be call ""soap opera"" storylines. Even the parts where Siddhartha are present, feel this way. Even though this is the weakest so far, it is important for the over all series.The story telling in this volume maybe weak, but Tezuka's creative, and experimentation with page layouts makes this book still a fun read."
1,Makes you feel like a dummy,"This should be titled, ""Kakuro to make you feel like a dummy!"" The ""easy"" ones are harder than the ""Beware! Very Challenging"" puzzles in the Will Shortz book. The puzzles are so small that I had to rip out the pages and enlarge them on a copier so I had room to work and didn't go blind. Almost any other book has to be better than this one."
2,"Many ""easy"" puzzles are intractable","In my opinion, an ""easy"" puzzle should be solvable in one lunch hour and without piles of scrap paper. And I agree with my friend Penny that a satisfying puzzle, of any difficulty level, should be solved mostly through deduction, not by blind trial-and-error.I am up to puzzle 57. The first twenty-five or so fit my definition of ""easy"" but then the book falls off a cliff. I have been unable to complete fifteen of the next 30 puzzles despite many hours of work and frequent peeking at the solution to keep on track. This is no way to have fun."
4,Maybe because I started with this book,Like many other people I came to Kakuro after learning suduko. This dummies book was the first Kakuro book I used. I found this book just fine. I am still a newbie to the puzzle but I don't find these puzzles anymore difficult then ones in other magazines or books. I also have a perodical type Kakuro book from Dell that has similarly difficult easy puzzles. The only reason why I didn't give this book 5 stars is that the Dell puzzle book has included number combinations so you don't have to guess from scratch how many different number combinations for 23 can fit in a seven box space. All in all not a bad book to start with and like any of the dummies books it only provides one way of doing things and there are many different ways out there.
3,A good rental for the Star Trek enthusiast only,"Set in an awards show style setting without the awards, I felt the show was very contrived and slow paced. It basically consists of cast members and a few other celebrities giving a teleprompted narative of how Star Trek affected them, followed by a series of clips from the various shows. It's greatest quality was the fact that all the cast members were present (minus Patrick Stewart and Leonard Nimoy) and we could see them all in their civilian clothing as real people. But the tone felt very thrown together, as when people are reading lines that are unrehearsed. I personally bought this in a bargain bin for 3.99 which was worth it, but I would rent this one before spending fifteen bucks."
2,Is not age appropriate,"The product is fantastic but the age recommendation on the review says ages 2 to 5 years, so I purchased it for my 21/2 year old, received the product and the age recommendation is for 7 years plus"
5,I had this book since the 80s. There is no better Cajun Cooking book.,This is a great Cajun Cooking book. I had my copy since 1986 or 1987 and have given it as presents to family members that live around the world. I did know some of the recipe contributors but they were exactly the type of people you would want to emulate in the kitchen. I have probably bought 8-10 copies of this book and just ordered two more for Christmas presents. I just can't express in words how good this book is!
2,Glow For Broke,"There have been numerous companies that've made stylus pens for the Nintendo DS and DS Lite. Although the ones that Nintendo has made for the system handles the best, other third-party companies have faltered. This one for the DS Lite also misses out. This one from Nyko, is a bulky stylus that glows brightly in the dark which isn't such a bad thing, but it doesn't really work very well. After a few times, it stops working with the DS Lite. It also will not work with the original Nintendo DS either, unlike the pens Nintendo made for the DS Lite. Just buy the ones Nintendo makes instead!Price: D-Convience: F+Overall: D-"
5,I love this book!,"I just got this book yesterday and I can't put it down. Mr. Lanzalotta's ideas make perfect sense---eating real food (as opposed to processed, manufactured food) in the right 'macronutrient-mix' will keep us satisfied, healthy, energetic and at our ideal body-weight.I am fascinated by the mathematical patterns found in nature. We are a part of nature, so why wouldn't those same patterns be found in us?The recipes look fabulous--Simple, real delicious meals for meat-eaters and vegetarians. I can't wait to try them!I am thinking of traveling all the way to Maine this summer (I live in Florida) just to visit Sophia, the author's bakery/cafe."
4,nutrition that tastes good.,"What i liked about the author and the book is he loves food and loves to eat, This not a book about what to cut out as it is a about eating lots of wonderful tasting food that just happens to be good for you. This a positive response to all the food police. No one will stick a food regiment that doesn'taste good. You look forward to his meals as opposed to feeling you are stuck with the meal if you are to stick to the diet. I would have rated it a 5 if they had just incuded color photos. 2 thumbs up."
2,Leonardo was a vegetarian,"Leonardo Da Vinci was a vegetarian whose own diet may have included bread, but certasinly no meat. That this 'minor' fact was overlooked in a diet book named for the artist is indicative of the amount of research that went into the book.."
4,Food for Thought,Well written and helpful. Gives you something to chew on both figuratively and actually.
5,Motorola Charger,"NNTN4963/ NNTN4980 Original OEM Nextel I205/I265/ I275/ I305/ I315/ I325/ I355/ I530/ I605/ I710/ I730/ I733/ I830/ I836/ I870/ I930 Rapid Travel In Wall ChargerThe charger is compact, with space to wrap the extension cord around the transmitter and out of sight. The plug, which flips up and out of the way, is not the more familiar left-wide ground plug but that doesn't seem to distract from its ability to work efficiently. There's also a rubber plug attached to the extension cord that allows the user to secure the adapter end to the transmitter"
4,morgana lefay metal of chivalry,"Metal is one of the most mixed kinds of music right now,and if you want to hear a band with lot of power and interesting sound listen to this album. I realy liked it and is not easy to meke me like something in metal buecause i been hearing this kind of music since i was seven and right now im twenty threee."
5,Great beginner biography,"The entire ""A picture book of..."" biography series byDavid Adler is outstanding. Perfect for lower elementary studentsdoing their first real report. Makes a great read-aloud for non-readers as they are easily completed in one sitting. The cute cartoon-like pictures are kid friendly. But most importantly, they are loaded with information including a timeline of important events."
5,Good for teachers,"I am preparing a lesson plan for first graders and this book works great as an anticipatory set. The pictures are colorful and engaging. The book also brings simplicity to a biography about Washington, bringing up important facts and dates."
2,Soulless,"Although the illustrations are charming, I find it difficult to find anything positive about this book.Children learn that young George went to some mind-numbing school. If so, how did he become so wise?No mention of either the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution. We meet the First President who objected to the British tea tax, but suppressed Pennsylvania Whiskey rebellion which was also about the taxes. No doubt the young reader will be confused, and how is an adult to explain ""no taxation without representation"" to a 5-year-old? Lots of minor issues are mentioned, like Washington's wisdom to stay out of European wars of the era. There's lots of talk of wars and paying for wars, but little sense of greatness. My fear that children will walk away with the idea that George Washington was some sort of a boring, terrible person."
4,Simple but Interesting,"My children found this book relatively interesting and the pictures were also reasonably effective. It is a good introduction to President Washington for those who know little or nothing about him. I would have appreciated a little more or his actions during the Revolutionary War. There was almost nothing on this (crossing the Delaware, Valley Forge, etc.)"
5,Can't be without this eye cream!,"So, having hit that mark in life where puffy eyes, hydration issues, lines, and the potential for crepe like skin .....I discovered this product per a rep for the SkinCeuticals line. It's fantastic! I have been using it for nearly 5 years now and have run out a time or two along the way, picked up something else to TRY and SEE and always go running back to the Eye Balm with my tail tucked for the misstep in judgement. This product hydrates yet vanishes the puffy under eye syndrome. With regular use you will notice that your lines and skin tone improve rather quickly. This is an awesome eye cream and I have tried several. Love eye balm!!! I use morning and evening for best result."
5,Mort Kunstler is an awesome artist.,Mort Kunstler is a superb artist and his pictures capture important points in the war. I like his work and he's from Wisconsin!
2,Get David Clayton- Thomas DVD,"This DVD is sub par and not worth buying. The sound is poor and the video is not much better. David Clayton-Thomas's concert at Montreal is much better for audio and video albeit as a solo act, but backed by a good band"
1,bad video and worth sound,is a shame the only material what we have about blood sweat and tears is a really bad work the video is a 4 or 5 over 10 and the sound is 2 or 3 over 10 is a really shame this work sorry but is true
5,Beethoven would have been very pleased with this recording.,"I read several reviews before I purchased this CD. As a violinist myself, I have specifics likes and dislikes of specifics violinists. This recording is truly beautiful and it performance sounds effortless. I would truly recommend this album to anyone who loves Beethoven."
4,"Good, not real great",I love the Concerto but was not comfortable with this arrangement. I know very little of the technical parts of classical music but I listen to it a lot and perhaps I am just more familiar with a different arrangement.
3,...pity about the sound.,"I bought this for my brother who, 20+ years later, still counts Stryper as one of his all-time favourite bands. He was thrilled to receive it but his joy was swiftly tempered upon hearing the poor sound quality. He states that visually all is well but the audio was of a poor quality which lessened his enjoyment somewhat. So, Stryper fans, be warned. I must stress that I'm basing this review on my brother's testimony but it seems to be in agreement with others I've read. MK."
1,A TERRIBLE SOUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This DVD has a terrible sound, the band is great, the songs are great, the images are great but the sound is too low , too bad. Where is the quality control ? It seems a illegal copy!!"
2,kenrod,The picture quality was great and the song selection is good. I give this a low score due to the sound. It is horrible muffled and way too much low end. I own a lot of dvd music and found this to be amongst the worst. I have to say i have been disappointed with all of strypers live material so far. If you're going to do something go all the way. i am a big fan and just would have liked more.
5,STRYPER LIVE!,"Dont quite understand the negative reviews...why would you watch an ultimate concert video without stereo or surround anyway. Everything perfect here, video excellent and sound too. I love Stryper and Michael Sweet and they dont fail us. Great musicians and a great setlist...777"
4,"Great band, great show, no fuss!","What's all the fuss over bad sound in some of the other reviews? Bottom line....it's not a million dollar production but, the band plays well and it's honest, what's wrong with that?!?! I enjoy getting DVDs from tours that I saw. I saw this tour and I am extremely happy to have this archived from that time in Stryper history. If you are wavering because of reviews about the sound being dicey, fear not. The video quality is good as well. Very enjoyable. Get it."
3,Excellent!...as a bootleg for homesickers.,"Well, What can I say?...The pros: I couldn't believe the vocal range from Michael Sweet alive, awesome! I always thought that in Stryper albums that voice was supported by some ""special help"" by the producer's team. He's a real singer and also a guitar player. Point for Him!On the other hand, the cons: the video and audio quality is really poor. Robert sound like if he were beating a drum set made of buckets. It also includes some extra stuff from the golden years, but on the same poor condition :( ."
2,"Great show, great songs, good video, HORRIBLE SOUND!!!!","I just bought this video and was very exited about it, sorry to say that the sound sucks big time, i think that with the good editing that the video has, and good video quality, the sound mix should have been better. I really don't know what the editors were thinking, what happened to the quality check? Who checks these things before introducing them to the market? I would hope that in the future the editors or the sound engineers take better care of this FUNDAMENTAL element, because when fans buy a DVD we expect to have a good video and sound quality together.All in all, I reccomend this DVD, but be prepared that the sound isn't up to standards, I have a 5.1 system and it still sounds bad."
4,Instructions for sound?????,"I too found the material to be outstanding, but I can't get over the fact that they did not include any notes on how to get the sound right if you DON'T have a surround sound system.I'm assuming there is a simple answer having to do with the set-up.The concert itself rocks and it's a pleasure being able to see and hear it all again without the distraction of all the spandex. Their music truly stands the test of time."
1,Not worth it at any price,"When I fist opened the package I noticed the small size of the tip. This is not the size I was expecting. I intended to replace my old 30 year old propane torch that had stopped working. I screwed the new one on the propane cylinder and tried to open the valve. It was so tight, I needed to use pliers to open it. I fianally got it opened and lit. Still dissapointed in the small size of it. I attempted to close the valve but a small amount of gas leaked out and stayed lit. I had to use pliers to close the valve. Needless to say this was a faulty or poorly made valve. This thing says made in USA but a Chinese made one would probably be superior. I promptly sent it back for a refund. I will buy a brand name one and probably use it for another 30 years."
3,Burns but leaves little control over flame,"(original five-star review) This torch worked exactly as I had hoped for. It was by far the best price I could find for any related items and am happy I made the purchase. It feels quite solid and I have no doubt that I'll have it around for years to come!Follow-up: After spending more time using this torch I've decided to lower the rating. It it very difficult to make fine adjustments to the flame. The knob is tight enough that it stays where you turn it to but making minor adjustments off of that position is fairly difficult. If you just need heat then this will produce it, but if you need more control over flame size/heat then this will present you with a challenge."
3,"Better than my old tip, but I wouldn't really call it a pencil flame","I was looking for a really fine tip with a small flame. ""Pencil flame"" seems to fit that description, but really this just throws the same flame as the tip I already had. The adjustment are smooth and it is of high quality, but don't expect a flame that you can turn down to the size of an actual pencil tip. I ended up buying one of those smaller, refillable butane torches. I don't know if it's the nature of propane, but I can get a much smaller flame out of the butane torch. Sorry for giving 3 stars if ""pencil flame"" is standard lingo for this type of tip, but ""precise point for detail work"" seems a bit of an exaggeration to me. Maybe it's as small as you can make a propane flame, but there are other types of torches out there that produce a much finer flame than this."
5,Great product for my little projects,"This works much better than the basic one that I had beeen using. The valve closes better, and this produces a better flame."
5,Old but timeless,"This is a very old album I listened to as a child growing up in Trinidad. The songs are soul wrenching. My mother had an old vinyl copy which was thrown out when they upgraded (17 years ago), but I have never forgotten the songs or the words. I just decided to look for it online on a whim. Anyone who buys this will never be disappointed. It will lift you up. My favorite ""Hear oh Lord"""
2,Brace,This one worked better than the $300.00 one we bought. It was more comfortable and the other looked better but my husband could never wear it! This is a reasonable price to pay and was shipped right away! My husband used it for drop foot.
3,fine book... is what it is,"Mr. Tarant's book is what it promises to be- an auto-biographical how-to detailing a glipse of time in a young person's life.The stories take place at Ithaca College in New York during the author's college education. The content is a well-arranged collection of information he acquired during several leadership opportunities he had there.Many of the lessons are elementary, but the analysis he gives them is quite sophisticated. It is especially entertaining to read some of the more off-color or tongue in cheek expressions he includes, though they are somewhat rare and hard to find.All in all, a good and easy read. Not sure if I'm a better person from it, however it seems knowledgeable and bright."
2,Let's not flatter the author,"Isn't it a cruel paradox that by writing a scathing review of the author, his book and his leadership style, we make a legend out of him by choosing to pay him any attention in the first place? Ah, irony...Anyway, here's my two cents. While Nick possesses many qualities often found in leaders, he lacks two of the most important qualities of a leader: humility and genuineness. What he offers up as humility is little more than the politically scripted melodrama of a man who puts more into his performance than he does into his character.On the plus side, he smells nice."
1,Does anyone have,Any of you have a bona fide perception of this book?Why are all of these reviews from people that know him and like/dislike him?Any Unbiased views of the book and NOT the person??
5,Neat Idea,I thought it was a really good book. College life is a clever subject matter and this author has taken a political spin that is refreshing and uncommon.
5,A Must Read,"This is a must read book for anyone working in youth ministry. If you are a youth pastor and haven't read this but, you MUST pick it up. It should also be required reading for anyone in you leadership."
4,Great book,"This book is full of great tips which can help in youth ministry and even secular groups which desire greater organization and structure without putting yourself in a box.This is a great book which I would suggest anybody read, but if you are in the youth ministry or our helping in the youth ministry get a hold of this book.The book is highly repetitive, but certainly gets the point acrossed. Get this book it will help any leader. Doug writes with wisdom, going through many years of experience before writing this book. It's always been said, ""If you want to know how to do something, ask somebody who did it."" Don't allow structure to bring you down."
2,Read carefully,"While giving purpose to everything done, the object of our purpose isn't mad clear. The author doesn't speak much of Jesus in the book. If we are purposefully purposeful it accomplishes little, but if we are purposeful about bringing glory to Christ in every facet of life then fruit will show. It still does make for an okay recourse for administration."
4,"""Youth Ministry"" is youth in minstry.","This book is phenominal for taking ministry and breaking it down to it's essential parts; fellowship, worship, evangelism, discipleship, and ministry. It teaches that ""Youth Ministry"" is more then ministry to youth, rather it is youth in ministry."
2,Think before you jump on the bandwagon . . .,"This is Rick Warren's ""Purpose Driven Church"" priciples applied to youth ministry. In terms of programming, Doug Fields has done a superb job applying these purposes to his youth ministry at the Saddleback Church. That doesn't mean it will work in your community. If you read this book do not make the mistake so many others do by jumping to quickly from ""purpose"" to ""programming."" Though the book claims to be about youth ministry that is driven by purpose, it is really about how Doug applies the purposes to his ministry at Saddleback. The majority of the book focuses on programming. There is nothing new here. If you buy this book think before you jump on the purpose driven bandwagon."
3,Hose is too short...,"My biggest issue is that the hose is too short. It should be long enough to travel from the floor (where the pump is mounted) to the top of a gallon antifreeze jug and then back down to the bottom of the jug. I couldn't get the antifreeze jug any closer than about a foot away due to the pump's location, so I had to tilt the jug and still could only use about three quarts of the gallon.I'm planning to extend the hose, but another 12"" of hose would have been welcome."
4,Easy to connect,Good kit easy to connect. If your pump is under your couchbed the hose to siphon is too short attach a longer one before install
2,Valve ports too small - restrict flow,"This is a really good idea that's flawed in execution. The small 3 way ball valves are not ""full port"" and the tiny holes really restrict the flow from the water tank to the pump. You're better off buying full port 3 way ball valves and making your own."
4,Works as expected,Simple to hook up to my water pump. Just unscrew existing inflow hose to pump and screw on the adapter finger tight and that's pretty much it. Don't forget to bypass the water heater to avoid wasting several gallons of antifreeze. The hose is pretty short but worked fine in my RV.
2,Valve is good but returned it.,The valve looks good but I ended up returning it as it wouldnt work for the way I needed to hook this into my RV's water system. Application was for a 2012 Keystone Cougar 327RES.
3,Works great but horrible design,Come on. I'm sure you've read over and over that there isn't enough tubing with it. I'm also sure that Camco has read the same thing. They just need to add another foot or so and this product would be 5 stars. Since they don't it is a 3 star at best - only because to make it work you HAVE to buy more tubing and a connector so it will reach your container of antifreeze.The pump works great and saves a LOT of antifreeze. Just be sure to get more tubing and fittings.
2,Would not purchase,"This is not at all what it's bragged up to be. I could not use the valve. The coupler broke, so now it won't fit on my pump. I will use the hose, but I could have made one up for a whole lot cheaper. I would reccomnd to do some research befor buying this Converter"
1,Short hose,"As stated by others, the hose is too short and it cannot be changed easily. Understand this kit is just a hose, valve and connector. The picture is not what you get. Amazon should correct the picture to show what you really will buy... very disappointing!"
1,did not work for me,I guess my 2011 Forest river 21SS is different than everbody else's camper. Screwing the unit to my Shurflo pump had it bottom out before it was sealed rendering it useless.
5,"Comprehensive Approach, Great Support!","I see some reviewers faulted the book for developing a single simulation game example (which the book does clearly advertise on the cover), yet this was one of the things I liked most about the book. Rather than develop a series of simplistic arcade-like games, you worked your way from game design planning up through a finished product that's easy to customize based on your imagination, artistic abilities, and such. It was much easier to delve into the subtleties of VB/DirectX that way, and I really appreciated having everything on CD rather than having to schlep off to a web site to download sample code.I encountered some funky issues with my old video card, but Mr. Freeze actually took the time via e-mail to help me through it. Wow, it was the first time an author ever actually took the time to answer one of me e-mails! This guy won't leave you hanging like some, and his writing style is very clear and makes complex topics a breeze to understand."
2,Very Poor,I was very unhappy with this book. If you know nothing and want to know more nothing this is for you.
1,Not even worth the [price]...,"Usually I wait for others to review a book before making my purchase. Well, this time I didn't and wish that I did. I expected a lot more from this book than what was offered. Since there are few VB game programming books available I try to check each one out. I choose this book purely on the authors name. Instead of exploring different aspects of game programming with VB and Direct X, the entire book is about one game, a sim game based on Sim City. If I would have known this from the start I wouldn't have bought it. So if you are looking to learn how to incorporate Direct X into your VB games look elsewhere. If you want to learn how to program a Sim game then check this book out."
2,Poorly written.,"What a disappointment.I was expecting a lot more from this book. The chapters have no logical flow based on game development. The author seems to have little or no experience writing or designing a game (before you complain, I have 7 retail titles published), and merely wrote this book to add to his collection of previous works. The whole thing comes across as a business application, masquerading as a game.Very few of the samples included on the CD-ROM actually work well, and can be crashed easily. Performance of the code is lackluster, with frame rates 1/10th of what is capable with VB and DirectX.Readers would be better off gaining knowledge from several excellent web sites devoted to DirectX development with Visual Basic."
1,Too superficial,"Very dissapointed. The help file of the SDK (8.0) makes a better job at explaining the principles. I found the book evasive as far as DirectX is concerned. Third part tools discussion make the essence of the book. May be of some interest about writing a game, but *almost* irrelevant about DirectX. You don't want consider this book if you already know some very basic DirectX stuff."
3,Explanation is not so good,"I expected a thorough explanation of DirectX when I bought this book. I want to know what CLIPPER is, why we have to use it...etc. There's so much cryptic terms to learn in DirectX - DDSCAPS_OFFSCREENPLAIN, DDSCAPS_PRIMARYSURFACE, DDSCL_ALLOWMODEX, BltFast, Blt just to name a few. The book does explain how to set up DirectX so that we can use Direct3D etc, but it does a poor job on explaining them succinctly, instead it spends too much time on third-party graphics tools. The explanation on the 3D coordinate space, vertex, points etc is very short.The explanation on the logic of the game is very boring, to be objective, it doesn't help me much. Overall, I'm disappointed."
3,Crinkle Cutter Reveiw,"This is a fine cutter, do wish it were a bit more heavy duty and had more a solid feel to it. Overall it is fine."
4,Works fine,"This cutter works just fine, and the handle is high enough that I can cut through pretty fat soap logs with ease. I could wish that the crinkle pattern were more pronounced, but otherwise I'm happy with this product."
3,Stain transfer,"This cutter works effectively, and easily makes clean cuts. The handle is not very comfortable to grip though, and the stain on the wood portion is unsealed. It transfered dye to my hands and to my sink when I washed it."
3,Thought I was getting another type of cutter,"I was disappointed when I received the cutter and confess I have not used it yet. I thought I could replace the old sharply edged cutter that makes REALLY crispy french fries. When I saw the smooth curves I knew it could not result in the fabulously crispy french fries that my old inherited cutter deliver consistently. I suppose I'll eventually try it because the old cutter is getting duller. I don't think those really sharp edged cutters are made anymore. If you know differently, let me know!"
5,Oh YES!,"This one was a surprise! It's got loss, forbidden love, and lots of deliciousness! Hot sex, hot men, with just enough emotion to make you tear up, what more could you ask for?! Why are you still reading this review?! Buy it already!"
1,A Title That Should Have Stayed Untranslated,"I am a fan of You Asagiri. I picked up this book thinking, it's You Asagiri, it must be good. This is a perfect case of, Don't Buy the Hype. I see this book on many Yaoi-must-have Lists and I see that Golden Cain exists on these list due only to the good graces 'creator-cult-status'.The plot is so formulatic it's painful. Purists will despise the missing kanji SFX being replaced with English ones, and the print and art is just...quite bad. Golden Cain is the worst example of what happens when something mildly entertaining in Japanese BL is put through the meat grinder or the Western comic book standards and hyped as something more than what it is.This book is why I despise English-translated BL. If it weren't for Drama Queen's release of Brother - I'd still be despising licensing."
3,reviewing is fun,Its a good book. Theres basically no plot. And the kid has major back problmes. But besides that. Its a good book. mmhmm
3,Classy gossip and some insights,"Sex sells, goes the old maxim, but if the sales of gossip magazines featuring the likes of the late Princess Diana, the present Drew Barrymore et al, then gossip may well be up there with sex as a matter of titilation (no pun intended) for the masses, of which I am one. THe fact is David Mamet is a great writer, Robert De Niro a great actor and the author, Art Linson, is no slouch in the producing arena. So if any of these are of interest to you, this book is a very well written - snappy dialogue, witty observations on the status of restaurant seating, and well constructed vignettes - as well as providing yet another insider's view on the shark aquarium known as Hollywood."
2,That just happened,"Art Linson's tales of Hollywood provide some intrigue and entertainment, but some of his writing falls flat. The ongoing relationship between the narrator and a former producer isn't a good enough excuse for the exposition in the storytelling. Not sure why Linson didn't just write a non-fiction tell-all and skip the part about his character getting things off his chest for ""therapy."" A life full of events that would have been more enjoyable in the hands of a stronger storyteller."
1,what happened is basically I got ripped off buying this,"I was looking forward to reading this after hearing how mindblowing this book was on dishing the dirt on Hollywood from the inside. I literally read one page and started skipping through it to see if it got better. I just found the writing horrid. It read like a bad novel or script. It just did not grab me at all. I'm sorry I really can't explain exactly why so this review is not really much of a full review but I just couldn't be bothered. Sorry, but I just did not want to waste any time on a book I could already see was not going to work for me.Simply put, I was expecting more along the lines of Julia Phillips' ""You'll Never Eat Lunch In This Town Again"" and was gravely disappointed at how the thing was structured."
1,Self-Indulgent Tripe,"Loved the movie, but this book is drivel. Self-indulgent self-aggrandising rubbish. Boring and pointless - a waste of a good tree. To cut a long story short Linson seems to have only got where he is thanks to Robert (Bobbie) De Niro's coat tails. Yes I know the title contains the word Bitter and that should have been a clue and maybe this was a public point-scoring exercise with those in Hollywood who wronged him, but I think he'd have been better off just slashing their tyres. Buy Adventures in The Screen Trade - at least Goldman had real successes to his name."
1,How can we understand Hollywood without addiction?,"As one who writes and researches alcoholism and the role it plays in human misery, misbehaviors and the bizarre, this book was a huge disappointment. There is bizarre, there is misbehavior (Baldwin's little fit over his beard)--but there is no alcohol or other drug use or addiction. We can't possibly understand Hollywood without inserting alcohol and drug use in a third or so of the characters--usually the ones written about (after all, they provide the most interesting stories). In addition, there was a lack of depth from someone who was so entrenched. There should have--and easily could have been--something far better than the superficiality sprinked throughout this little book. Thus far, I rarely write reviews and wouldn't ordinarily consider panning a book. Unfortunately, this one deserves it."
4,"Great profile, also incredible privilege to see Augusta.","Recommend viewing to all who love beautiful places and golf. Also, to anyone who fanticizes about other things, ie...."
5,Fixes belt buckles,"I needed a couple of these C clamps to repair a belt buckle where the snap on rivets lost their snapping capability. So, I got some glass/metal adhesive, and applied it, then used these C clamps to secure the two snapping sections for about 4 days. My belt is now in perfect working order thanks to these excellent C clamps."
5,"Quirky, hilarious....a must read bathroom book!!!!",Wow... I laughed so hard my side hurt!!! This book is a tribute to the greatest garage sale of all time. The pictures are amazing and the email notes are sooo clever! Thanks... can't wait for book #2?
2,Not really that funny,"I'm an eBay addict, and my sister bought me this book for my birthday. I wanted to write a review for gift-buying relatives of ebayers to see -- just cuz we like ebay doesn't mean we'd like this book. It seems like a funny idea, but the idea is funnier than the actual book. You can browse funny auctions on ebay for free."
2,Disappointing.,"Half Price Books was giving away hundreds of copies of this book earlier this week, so I picked up a copy, thinking that it'd be a good read.I'm not going to lie, it's really not that entertaining. I mean, it's maybe the kind of thing you'd spend a few minutes leafing through if it was an article in a magazine, or maybe something online. But it's not worth buying a book - because in all honesty, a lot of these aren't funny or entertaining. You'll find yourself going ""okay... was this supposed to be cool?"" more often than not. Save your money, methinks."
5,Pure genius!,"Hartzman's take on E-bay is a riot! The cross between his hysterical e-mail banter and the beautiful photography that glamorizes these ridiculous items, is brilliant. Can't wait to see the follow-up!"
5,Easy and fun to read,"Well planned and thought out. For a smart, driven person who wants to make money quick! I loved the information and insight!"
2,Read it but don't buy it.,Mostly motivation talks suggesting that there are many idiots out there who will sell their houses to someone who has no credential but could talk smart.
1,Ego trip for authors,Dont bother with this book. It has some useful information for the newbie but it is an ego trip for the authors. The stories they present have little useful information other than to tell you how great the authors are. The free stuff they give you is just as worthless.
2,Absolute Newbie,"This category of books (Investing in Real Estate) has the formula down cold. General topics are covered as well as the gist of possible scenarios, but NO details are given regarding the process. As the saying, goes the ""devil's in the details"" - in this case so is the money and you won't make ANY if this is the only book you read. If you don't have ANY book on foreclosures this would be an OK place to start, but my suggestion is to keep looking or find a good foreclosure attorney (no I'm NOT an attorney) willing to tutor you in the ins and outs of the process and explain the pros and cons for the homeowner and mortgage company and where an investor/buyer may fit in."
5,Foreclosures for dummies,"I'm a beginning investor. I've been researching foreclosures for a little while now and realize that this is a market that I should be tapping into. After reading Peter and David's books, I really feel that I have a good understanding of the foreclosure process and some different ideas on how to approach sellers. Thanks Peter and David for chaper 5 where you talk about negotiating and the information on page 106 (scripts for getting free lists of foreclosures...even before anyone else knows about them) that is amazing information. You've been a big help to my investing.Thanks."
2,Wish they would hire a prof'l editor for all their books.,"I own and/or have read their other books and regretfully have to say that their books aren't professionally edited. Their works seem to project an ""aw shucks"" tone but I find them to contain too much hyperbole.I don't bother with their new books anymore since the writing is tiresome and predictable. They may have new information to share but that fact is lost because of the book's poor editorial presentation."
5,This is a great book!,I've spent lots of money on complete courses dealing with foreclosure properties. I was amazed when I read this book. It had just about everything I needed to know here in one inexpensive resource!I found this book to be very practical in helping to work my way through the whole foreclosure process. I especially liked the section on 24 pitfalls and how to avoid them. This was very helpful.I really do recommend this book to anyone wondering how to handle foreclosure properties.
5,Beautiful book about plants...,This was one of the books I had to read for my herbal studies... beautifully written... really great topics covered... lots of top notch info... I will definately re-read this book a few times... I learned so much and felt so connected to the writers/herbalists and the herbs. Learned some cool stuff about some of the herbs that I never knew either... great for the book collection of every herbalist.
2,Horribly Made,"I grew up loving Star Wars - the movies, and especially the toys. Now grown, I am very excited to see my children loving them too. So, there was a great excitement for me as I and my 4 year old daughter went to buy some Episode III toys. But these new 3.5"" figures are terribly made. The plastic is too bendable, and made with too little material. The figures can barely hold the weapons they come with or stand up. They have many poorly made joints, which snap apart if too much pressure is applied. I am appalled at the quality of these toys. If you are collector, and do not plan on opening them, then by all means - go for it. But if you hope to play with them and watch your children play with them, you will be very dissapointed."
4,Great!! (while it lasts),"This is a pretty good product. It lasted about 10 months before the seams inside the cube came apart. (The seams inside hold plastic-ware that helps the cube keep its shape) It was about 1 week later that the zipper on one of them came apart.One thing I wish could be fixed though... to keep the zipper closed during wash, the zipper needs to be pushed past a piece of elastic. Pushing that metal zipper past the elastic and pulling it back out to open it, wrecks my nails. I mean I don't keep my nails long or anything - but, the metal would dig little notches into my nails. These notches are deep enough that I have to file them out or they snag everything.I think this product lasted a pretty darn good time considering I use them in the washing machine about 1x/week."
2,Not good for sculpted bras,"This item is not suitable for washing sculpted underwire bras. The ribs on the sides flexed inward during washing, and crushed the cups. It seems like it will be good for washing other delicates, and for that purpose the set of 2 is a good deal."
5,Best bra saver for washing machine,"This is by far the best product for safely washing underwire bras. The shaped ribbing of the cube allows for several bras to be washed thoroughly and safely. This is the only one that really works for bras with C cup or larger underwires! Trust me, I've tried them all!!"
1,horrible,"Didn't work. The zipper kept coming undone in the washer and my bra wouuld fall out. I would only wash 1 bra at a time and wear small bras. After three uses the lining tore out and I threw it away. I bought a replacement from another brand and it works great. Don;t buy this, you will waste your money."
1,Waste of money...,"I wasted my money on these. I bought two, and both of them came apart in the washer after a couple of uses. :O("
4,What are all you complaining about!? This things great!,"I bought one of these before and loved it. If I had to say one negative its that I am a 34DD and this won't comfortably hold 2 of that size bra. So I just bought another one! :)My favorite feature is the plastic ribbing that holds the shape of the bag and nicely protects bras from being crushed in the wash. AND the zipper won't come undone if you properly shove it into the nice little elastic securing feature!Anyone who has issues with this bag falling apart and whatnot, its probably because you're trying to put it in the dryer. But HELLO! Never put bras in the dryer anyway! In my opinion this bra wash bag is well-built, and geniously designed!Love this product. May even need another one(:"
1,"Stupid, terrible, hate them","Maybe its because my bras aren't that big, but they fold in on themselves in this thing. Boo."
2,Not as Advertised,The product arrived and there was only one bra washing cube even though it was advertised as a set of two. Very disappointing.
4,Historical Depth for Baseball Lovers,"For baseball lovers Red Barber is an icon. For many NPR listeners so is Bob Edwards. I did not hear these segments when they were broadcast. For many of them I was living abroad. However, reading this collection by Bob Edwards compiled after Red Barber died is a delightful historical study. These ""snippets"" provide depth of insight into the development of the sport, development of friendship and each of the men involved. Acceptance of change and people is a major theme in these vignettes with all the difficulty, pain, disappointment, fulfillment and joy the acceptance entails. Whether baseball fan or NPR devote or both this book inspires, challenges and is a ""good read""."
3,Sabona Copper,"I think it works , worn it for a couple of months , and I at least think it works , does leave a green wrist so don't be surprised or concerned comes right off with a little soap and water , same treatment for the bracelet to clean it , overall i'm satisfied , good luck"
1,Hoax..save your $$,I am sorry but any relief you my feel is purely pyschosomatic there is NO evidence that is helps anything at all...What is more it is thought that the magnets and the copper react to the iron in the blood...not true...if this were true when people are put in a MRI for imaging they would explode. Sorry. I only gave it one star because I had to in order to rate it...save your $$$
2,not accurate,"this thing has big numbers on it, but is not very accurate, at least 10% off in temp and humidity. spend your money on something else, like a cheap scientific therm."
2,Malfunction,"After a couple months, the humidity became stuck at 20%. Even holding it by my humidifier didn't help."
2,I don't think it's accurate . . .,"When I put the outdoor sensor out the window, the readings I was getting seemed extremely high compared with the indoor (we're in an un-air-conditioned room on the third floor of a brick building, yet the outdoor temp, in the shade, read about two degrees higher than the stifling indoor temp). So, just to experiment, I brought the sensor inside and placed it next to the base unit, left it a while, and compared temperatures again--there was still a two-degree discrepancy. This morning I came in to work and checked the temps, not having moved anything since the night before: now the outdoor sensor registered 1.5 degrees cooler than the base unit, still sitting next to it. The humidity reading seems unreasonably low, as well: a constant 36%. This thing is basically a toy."
5,nice accurate unit,I am happy with the unit. I have had it for over two years and never had an issue with it. It gives accurate humidity and temp readings.
5,Beautiful adaption of what was actually a rather depressing story,"I had the video when I was a kid and a few years ago, I found it at Wal-Mart along with ""The Wind and the Willows"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"" done by the same company and I grew up with those as well.Anyways, this version was beautifully done. I've read some of the book and seen another adaption by Hanna-Barbera which was more faithful to the book, to my surprise it's actually a rather depressing story about the biography of a horse. Almost like ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" only not as action-y and fun also set in 19th century England instead of the American West.But this adaption is working through it, giving it not only an entertaining plot about courage and loyalty but also a colorful cast of supporting characters and a dork of a main antagonist also a nasty supporting villain.I positively recommend this adaption to anyone who loves horses and knows or doesn't know the story of ""Black Beauty""."
3,Romance and Cigarettes,I waiting a long time for this movie to come out on dvd. It's a decent movie about a man's unfaithfulness to his wife and family. It's a musical too. Kind of boring and long though. Had to get it because I love Mandy Moore and she is in it. Has a great cast though.
3,started out - good - faded toward end,we were enjoying the first half - see these movie stars whom you'ld never suspect being singing - Chris Walken? but toward the end the novelty wore out - still OK & would recommend for a hoot!
4,"JOHN TURTURRO, OPUS 3","**** 2005. Written and directed by John Turturro. An original musical comedy with some great actors like Susan Sarandon, Christopher Walken and Kate Winslet. Too bad that the movie didn't find its public because the screenplay is smart, the music agreeable and some scenes really hilarious. Recommended because a film that is not seen is a dead movie. Give it another chance."
2,Dumb film,A wild and crazy comedy full of flights of imagination. But for most part the film was pretty stupid.
4,Unhappy,"Romance and Cigarettes is great. The replacement cassette player sucks. It another loser from Photoland. The link you gave me was inaccessible. I am fairly livid now. I have no useful way to contact you, and a player which when it goes is like a 33 1/3 album playing at 78. Get the picture ?"
4,Another good Lowndes,"While not as nerve-wracking as ""The Lodger"" or as romantically interesting as ""A Chink in the Armour"" or ""The End of Her Honeymoon,"" this is still an entertaining Lowndes work. Spiritualism is one of the main themes here and while feels a little more old fashioned in its ideas than some of her other works, it's still fun and highly recommended for her fans."
4,"Good watch, good time, no problems",I've had this watch for about 5 months now. It's a very good watch. I've set it using a radio time clock and it keeps perfect time. The stem has not pulled out and I really don't see how it could unless you pull it with pliers or something. I like the feature where you can turn off the glowing digital time and date. You are left with a very cool looking black face with three hands. It keeps time in two zones and has all the usual features of an Ironman watch. The strap look likes it will last and it's comfortable to wear. I have no problem recommending this watch to anyone.
5,Great Watch,"I love this watch! The only things I can see that would be a nice addition to the design are:1. Make the face of the watch of a whiter material so that the Indiglo would light up the analog hands better and,2. Improve the manual that comes with the watch. It does not tell you how to turn the digital function on and off...which is easy to figure out BTW (press and hold the STOP/RESET button until it is off or on)."
3,Good watch but the band breaks . . .,"This has been a very good and accurate watch. It is feature-rich and very durable except for the watchband. The price is very reasonable. It broke in a little more than one year of every-day use. It has to be returned to the Timex factory repair center in Little Rock, Arkansas, for replacement. The watchband is molded into the case and cannot be replaced except by the factory. I looked, but could not find and information on-line about how to even order a replacement."
2,Timex Ironman Watch,"I was pleased to find this watch on Amazon for a great price. I really liked the design of the watch. Unfortunately, I cant give the watch a good review. I have bought Timex watches ever since I've wanted a watch. I am a runner and have always used timex. Overall, I love the watches and was excited to buy this one for more casual use. The battery died after a year and the cool, brushed aluminum/metal surround started and eventually fell off. Also, part of the strap broke, leaving the excess sticking out rather than hugging tight to the band. would not recommend this product. Maybe it was just a fluke? not sure, I will still buy other timex watches, but I thought maybe the ""Ironman"" name would mean better durability."
4,Great Value + Really cool looking watch + 10 Month Update + 19 Month Update,"I bought it as a way to keep track of the times for each mile (or Km) on my runs and it does the job really well, it tells you total run so far as well as the current lap time, and you can change the location of each time (above and small or bellow and big).I gave it 4 stars because it lacks an average lap time option and best lap time. Besides that, it has a great alarm system and dual time zone clock, witch is good when you're on a different time zone and don't want to change your watch back and forth.========It's been 10 months since I wrote this review and I've trainned for a marathon (philly 2008) using this watch at least 5 times a week on runs and at the gym and it's still going strong. Weird thing is it still looks new; I'm waiting for the wrist band to break.========Ok, so It broke; after 19 months the belt broke and you can't replace it."
5,Timex watch,Very happy with the watch. The seller had fast shipping and I could not find a better price anywhere.
1,Didn't keep good time.,I loved this watch for a couple of days. Especially how the whole face displays the digital information. I could read it. The analog hands were also easy to see especially when you have the black digital display turned off so only the hands showed. The buttons were easy to press and in the same place and order as most Timex digitals. So easy to check the time in the dark.Timex has always been a reliable brand name. I could not believe it when the hands didn't keep good time. They lost a noticable amount of minutes in less than a day.I despair that even Timex has become a casualty of the global race to the bottom.
2,Not enough battery power for the whole watch,"While this watch is great in form and design, it lacks in function in that the battery power is not enough to keep the digital time going as well as the analog watch hands. The hands on day 1 started moving slowly, and now about 1 month into ownership, they have almost stopped moving completely.While I definitely recommend Timex products in general, I would stick with a digital only or an analog only watch. The combination of the two falls short of expectations."
2,alright,"My watch was great for about the first year and then everything started faalling apart. The metal face fell off, the band that holds the tightner together broke off, and my background display will not turn back on. Very dissapointed in this watch considering i did pay about $90 for it. I would not reccomend this watch because it is not durable, and will not last."
5,WATCHER,EXCELLENT IRONMAN WATCH! RIGHT PRICE! CLEAR FACE! ACCURATE TIME! NICE LOOKING! EASY READ OF TIME & DATE! A GOOD BUY! RPM
2,Do not buy... The band is horrible.,These other guys on here aren't on these reviews aren't lying. I had the watch for about a year. Thought this was a great workout and everyday watch. After the band started to break it was worthless. The problem is now it sits on my dresser. Not worth the money I payed for it. Great watch for about a year. Thats it though. Hopefully one day they will offer a watch worth buying.
2,"great watch, weak resin watchband","I bought this watch for Christmas in 2007. I love the analog/digital format and great features, but the resin watchband broke after only 11 months of light use - a real disappointment. I have contacted Timex to see if the band can be replaced and will update this review when I get their response."
2,Better other Batteries... No..... Better other Smarthphone,"Is better spend more money and buy original batterie than this, and even better buy another smartphone that Motorola Q."
2,I expected more,"This book was an interesting read, but I expected more. It was too bad that the photos used were in black and white, specially the photo of Elvis that was taken four months after his ""death"". Another thing that bothered me were the chapters on Numerology and Clues. Here the author expresses her knowledge and beliefs on the New Age and Numerology. I was very uncomfortable with the way she accepts comparisons (sometimes forced to fit her theory) between Elvis and Jesus, made by other authors or people.Besides that, this book opens the possibility that Elvis did not die on August 1977. The reasons for Elvis to fake his death along with other evidence strongly suggests that Elvis did have many reasons to dissapear from the public eye."
5,Total Bartok,"I don't know what else to say. I have never felt so completely involved in this music (the Takacs recording comes very close, with state of the art sound -- I'm glad to have both sets). Listening to these quartets in sequence -- the 3 disks permit a chronological progression -- is a revelation, as one moves from the romantacism of the First Quartet to the final, elegaic Sixth. The 2nd disk contains the thorniest works: quartets 3 and 4. Listening to them together, as played by the Vegh Quartet, I sensed the distillation of all that can be expressed in music within these highly concentrated forms. Yet these are earthy, swaggering performances at the same time -- physically and intellectually stimulating.""Now, even potted palms might rejoiceto hear this counterpoint, these lambent chords.The infinitely baffled speakers voicea heart-to-heart that leaves me wanting words.""I suspect the poet was thinking about Haydn or Beethoven,but it applies here in spades."
1,Cough Salad Annie,"I have great respect for the Follow That Dream label and the manifold treasures from Elvis Presley's recorded legacy they have been giving us over the last years. Yet, the current ""Polk Salad Annie"" CD should never have been considered for commercial release, not even on a label which basically aims at fans. FTD producer Ernst Jorgenson himself warned us about the recording of the Vegas concert on February 15, 1970 in his book, when a cold-ridden Elvis was coughing through most of the songs. And yes, this is exactly what they released this time. The result is abominable with most of the songs screwed up by a coughing or laughing Elvis. The few rehearsal cuts from a later date (which we already had on Platinum anyway) cannot save the disaster.What are they going to find next to milk the cash cow?"
3,The Story Goes On,"As one of the greatest fans of the King,I can't stop my self buying Follow That Dream series (FTD's), specially the live recordings. Polk Salad Annie is one of them. I really love and enjoy listening to it. I would like to know the reason why the prices of FTD's are too high?"
4,"Tough way to make a living, boy.","This is another Elvis CD released by Follow That Dream Records, which releases what are essentially ""official bootlegs"" of material that will only be of interest to hardcore Elvis fans. The ""limited"" nature of these CDs is why they cost more than normal CDs. This particular CD presents an Elvis concert from February 15, 1970. Several concerts that month were recorded for potential inclusion on the albumOn Stage. None of the songs from this particular show made it onto the album. Which is not to say that they aren't good, because they are. But the opening number, ""I Got a Woman"", starts in the middle of the song, because the tape recorder didn't start rolling in time. There are seven ""bonus tracks"" which were not performed at this concert; four songs are from different concerts and three songs are from a rehearsal. This is a good CD, but will really only be of interest to serious Elvis fans."
1,stupid joke,"this is possibly the dumbest thing ever. i hope noone wastes their tome buying this thing. absurd, ridiculous, useless, worthless."
3,Get it if you still need more,"While a second disc makes this early compilation sound a bit extended, it isn't hard to take exception with one of neo-prog's most reliable discographies."
1,Mismatch made in America,"I feel sorry for this woman. She's clearly intelligent, and she writes well. But why would she want to marry someone who wrote such dull and uninspiring letters? I can only hope (for her sake) that he's more interesting in person."
5,Charming love story,"My son recently married a beatiful woman of Indian ancestry who thrives on her large family in Orange County, CA. When I heard the PBS radio interview with Ehud Sperling, I was curious about what he found attractive in a woman from India. The book is really her book. She reveals herself as charming and definitely ready to leave her career in micro-biology in the crowded South India city of Madras for a new adventure and opportunity to be a full time wife and mother. Although he comes across as resourceful and generous (and obviously fedup with USA women as wives), her values, insights, and faith in God are what give the book its radiance. This book affirmed the wisdom of my son's choice!"
4,Great Book..Wonderful Condition,The manual was in great condition. Was more than I could ask for. Everything in there including a wiring schematic which was very much needed since I am having electrical problems. The manual arrived quickly and as I stated before in great condition.
4,"Good shop manual, but second to the Honda manual","While I have already noted it's second to the Honda manual, it's something you should have around. A good (reasonably priced) physical copy on-hand is needed many times for reference. Occasionally, some pictures are lacking in detail (grainy/black and white) or it's just missing that one camera angle you really needed. Some minor details may have changed over the years as more experience has been gained with these motorcycles. Overall, keep this around as a good, handy shop maintenance, but do not regard it as a the end-up-be-all bible for the DOHC Honda of this vintage. Keep that in mind and you'll be fine, and be able to get much use out of it."
4,As expected,"I ordered this manual because I had just bought a 1980 CB750F to repair. Having had no motorcycle experience before, this book has been able to explain the processes required to to what I need to do. Although it does lack some detail, it gets the majority of the information, and is definitely useful."
3,It is not the socks... it is the shoe,"It is not the socks that give you blisters.. It is the shoe. These sock does help alittle. But if you have getting blisters from running, try a different brand or size."
3,Not the Best,"I didn't find this book confusing. However I did think that his ""bricks"" approach isn't the best method. It seems to only add more steps or more things to think about when your dealing with an already confusing topic. Also I feel like there are better techniques to accomplish the same outcomes that were addressed. There were many techniques that were very good though such as his approach to reflections, and his technique to find the correct height of people anywhere on the picture plane is probably one of the easiest and best I've seen. If you did get through this book or any other basic perspective book I would recommend Gnomon: Basic Perspective Form Drawing by Scott Robertson . What shines in Scotts DVD is working with ellipses and drawing and connecting curved lines in space. Very useful stuff."
4,Excellent introduction to perspective,"Excellent and comprehensive little guide for all aspects of the perspective. Now I know why it is classic. I am self-taught amateur artist and this is the first book that I studied on that subject. The book helped me a lot but I have my doubts. The last part of the book seems to be running out of fuel, is not so very explanatory on shadow creation. Either way, I love this book and I recommend it to my friends."
3,Good for a quick reference,"This book would be a good reference to have around if you've managed to paint yourself into a corner where your perspective doesn't work. Flipping through the pages, you'll probably discover why. The author gives simple exercises for those trying to figure out the principles of perspective in a very easy to understand manner. He covers things you might not think of such as where to space vanishing points, perspective up and down hill, false eye levels, reflections, shades, and shadows. There are many examples, all drawn, in each chapter."
4,helped me with art class,"This book was shown by my art teacher as a good reference for drawing perspectives. This book has helped, but is a bit hard to understand what it is telling you to do. Although a bit difficult it is packed with pix and info for drawing several different perspective views."
4,good help!,I found this book to be very simple and step-by -step written.A really good help for me as an art teacher!
4,good basic instruction,"A good read, reiterates the importance of perspective for the amateur sketcher..very easy to understand and incorporate the principles in my work."
5,AMAZING BOOK!!,"This is a GREAT book on perspective.Its shows you the wrong way to draw something,then it shows how to correct it and WHY the first image is wrong.It goes into detail about everything and is the ultimate book on perspective.I highly recommend it!!"
5,A Drawing Must Have,I'm an avid collector of art books and I've found this particular book one of my greatest acquisitions on the subject of perspective. The lessons are clearly presented giving a newbie a solid foundation for drawing.I bought this book because a previous Amazon reviewer stated that this book was recommended by Andrew Loomis. I was not mislead!!!
2,Elementary,"This book is extremely elementary; it's truly for somebody who has no art experience at all. If you are an Interior Designer looking for a book on perspective drawings chances are you already know way more than this book has to offer. I would recommendPerspective for Interior Designersby John Pile, it's extensive yet very clear and concise."
2,Not for Interior Design,"This book just wasn't for me. Maybe I expected too much after reading all the praise for this book. But I found the explanations insufficient, most of the time I had to look at the little drawings and try to figure it out myself.There's not much in terms of interior design, which is what I would like to sharpen my drawing skills for. At one point, Norling gives a drawing of a box, and then he tells you to turn it, so it becomes a room and you can place furniture in it. But how??In my opinion, the book lacks clear instructions and step-by-step drawings.I expected more, maybe I'll find it in Pile's book."
1,not the best,the book only confused me more . this is not how it is taught in school.Please dont use the book it is not accurate based on how i was taught in college.
5,RV Winterizing & Storing DVD,Great information for folks new to the RV world and a good refresher for anyone who has had a RV for awhile but may have forgotten a few things.
5,The Real Deal,"This book was about professionals, after hours. I see many women like Rita, Rashawn, Qiana, and even Sherry, in my line of work. I know it's hard to hold up the image 24/7. I enjoyed reading about these strong females and how they handled their relationships. Nigel and Terrell were so typical that you had to love them, though. I will always wonder where Michelle finds these gorgeous men to write about. The story makes falling in love look easy."
3,A good read...DIFFERENT!,"I enjoyed reading this book, though I understand the frustration of ""Tanya"" from 'somewhere out there'. The book did move quickly to a resolution, however the happy ending made it all worth while. And, while I don't necessarily agree with Quiana's desire to have a child without a husband, the story goes to show that every decision we make MUST be For Love's Sake!"
3,For the sake of Love?!,"I often wish Amazon had the option of using half stars and this is one book that I would have added the extra half star. For Love's Sake was a simple, quick and easy read. A romance with a different flava. Interracial romance, artificial insemination, and sperm donations are the main topics. Qiana, the main character hears her biological clock ticking, and wants to have a baby so she goes to Family Makers Sperm Bank. Nigel an up and coming attorney does not want to have children, so his solution is to donate his sperm to a bank. After a mix up at the clinic, Qiana and Nigel are thrown together in a hestitant relationship. Do they find love or are they together for a common cause? You have to read the book to find out!!"
2,The worst book!,"The only reason I finished the book, was because i bought it online and didn't want to waste my money.I was very disappointed with the story line. The storyline didn't go anywhere. When it actually started getting better the story was over. I definetly would not recommend this to anyone!"
5,Just a good story,"No, For love's Sake was not a deep story with alot of deeper--hidden-- meanings. It was a fiction romance. And it was one that was nicely done. The issue of artifical insemination was handled nicely. The inter-racial relationship was handled well. Her use of polyphonic voicing within the same chapter is done well. Once again, I think Ms. McGriff has invited us readers into her storytime circle, and entertained us. The book is one that can be completed in one concentrated sitting. I enjoyed it--looking forward to the next."
3,"Good, but not better than the first one","I was very disappointed in this remake. I was hoping that it would focus more on Qiana and Nigel, the only couple that I had a real interest in. Terrell and Rita are okay, but they are not the couple that everyone likes. Qiana and Nigel are the couple that people want to read about. There were about maybe five or six extra pages on Qiana and Nigel. Honestly I prefer the first printing (the shorter version)over this novel. I absolutely love that novel, but this one is just okay. It doesn't add anything to the old story. It just lengthens it, nothing more. In my opinion you should just buy the first printing of this book and forget about this one."
5,DREAMS CAN COME TRUE,"Author Michelle McGriff characterized Qiana as a intelligent black woman who wanted a child and family, but she lacked a commitment from her live in boyfriend. Taking matters into her own hands, Qiana went to a sperm bank clinic. As fate would have it, through a mistake, she was given the sperm of a white man. Series of events unveiled the mistake and the donor. Nigel met Qiana through mutual friends and was attracted to her, Qiana matched the dream he had on a regular basis. Nigel discovered he was the father of Qiana's baby, and wanted to be a part of Qiana's life. The story was well written with interesting insights of the characters. Great read."
3,Descent pump for the money,"I put this in my electric boat in a very tight space in my boat's pontoon hull after my original pump failed and I was not able to remove it. I wanted to get this pump to the lowest point in the hull but was not able too because of the way it is configured. I was able to get all the water out except for 1/2"" left at the bottom. We will see how the pump works over the next year. So far ao good."
1,"Rusted, replaced Rusted again, returning",Wow! These are heavy duty and wonderful EXCEPT for the fact that the inside surface rusts after one use. I am not going to replace for a third set.
4,You could probably kill someone with the 1 cup'r...,"I bought these for the wife last Christmas. We both love them.They're insanely sturdy. Seriously... I'm not kidding about the 1 cup'r. It's got some heft to it.The only reason I'm giving these great measuring cups 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the somewhat poor design. I say this because these cups do NOT stack well. Perhaps they weren't designed to do so, but we did find it moderately disappointing just the same. If stacking together, the 1/3 fits just snuggly enough inside the 1/4 that it can (and has on occasion) become stuck inside the 1/4. Further, the 1/4 doesn't fit inside the 1/2.Thus... all in all, I believe there is room for improvement in the design.That small thing aside, these measuring cups are well worth while. You won't find a more sturdy set."
1,Overpriced and too heavy,"I purchased these from Williams-Sonoma because they're beautiful and sturdy, and they have the ""All Clad"" name. I wish I weren't such a sucker for brands. The handles are an ergonomic disaster, especially the 1/4 c. measure (the handle is so short it's like holding something for a doll!). And all of the cups are so heavy that they're unwieldy when trying to scoop ingredients out of a larger container, like a canister or jar. I agree that they'll last forever, but in this case I don't think that's a good thing!"
3,A gift,I gave this set as a gift and really don't know if he has enjoyed using it. He had requested it.
4,All-Clad fans will enjoy,"First, I have washed and dried my set several times and have noticed no rusting, as several other reviewers have noticed, and would be equally disgusted if they did show signs of rust. Maybe this has more to do with different levels of minerals in water depending on our area of the country? Just a thought.Second, while I like the set a lot, they are indeed heavy, heavier than I expected, and so if you're maybe older (my grandma complained at how heavy the All-Clad kettle is, for example) and want something lighter, this set isn't for you. But for the rest of us All-Clad fans they continue to be the investment we think the brand is as a whole."
2,Mismarked Measuring Cups,"The measuring cups are heavy, sturdy, and nest inside one another for easy storage. However, they arrived mismarked. There are two cups marked 1/4 cup, one fits neatly inside the other. Obviously the larger of the two 1/4 cups is supposed to say 1/3 cup. I'm going to attempt to return, but not sure to whom to return."
5,Sweet Measuring Cups,"You don't have to be a chef / cook to love these measuring cups. The look great, feel great (nice weight) and work. Best thing about these measuring cups is that they feel solid - looking forward to this being the last set of measuring cups we need to buy for a long...long...time."
2,"Started to RUST within a month, Amazon exchanged","So I purchased a set of these measuring cups in early January 2012. I liked that they matched myAll Clad Copper Core 10-Piece Cookware Setand other All-Clad products that I owned, also that it was nice to have a 2/3 cup measuring cup. They are really heavy and appear to be well made. Within a month I noticed some corrosion inside two of the measuring cups, at first I thought it was so dried food particles that the dishwasher did not remove, but after scrubbing them by hand it was obvious that they were rusting. Amazon immediately sent me a new set and I returned the original set I purchased.I'll update this review in a few months - hopefully there won't be any problems with the new set."
4,Good job,"Bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom. Being a horrible procrastinator, I ordered this within 10 days of Christmas. The package arrived much sooner than I had expected. The only reason I haven't given the company five stars is because there wasn't anything particularly awesome that stuck in my mind about the whole order, but don't consider the missing star a mark against them. I will definitely do business with this company again should I ever have the need."
1,ALL-Clad junk - poor quality control - Misstamped sizes!,"They look great out of the box, however this is ""ALL-CLAD"" made in China junk. Ours came with two cups labeled 1/3 cup, although one was obviously misstamped and should have been ""1/2"" cup. Now to go through the hassle of trying to get a replacement or return."
3,Neat little essay on Life and Perfection,"I'm AMAZED this book is available! I always assumed it was self-published.Anyway, it's a gentle early-'New Age' reflection on being alive and realizing that everything is, in its own way, perfect. The author is a Vietnam veteran and world traveller who goes hiking (apparently regularly) through the Andes with his brother.I'm not going to call it great, but it's a very pleasant, short read written from a loosely counter-cultural point of view. Wish I knew more about the authors..."
1,Five minutes?!!,"The promotional paragraph describes 8 to 15 minutes of battery life per use and trumpets the possibility of using the Hovercraft on water. Once it comes, the package advisory says not to use it for more than FIVE minutes on water. That doesn't see to fall in that 8-15 minute range, does it?"
1,Super RC Racing Hovercraft is a dud,"I ordered the hovercraft for my 13-yr-old for Christmas. He has tried it out and it barely moves even on the smoothest of surfaces. It will not reverse at all. The batteries are all new and charged up, but the power is weak. It makes lots of noise but goes nowhere fast. I would send it back, but we accidentally threw out the box with the Christmas wrappings. I won't buy another power type vehicle over the net after this."
4,island on bird street,This was a good film but sad too. the main actor was fine and I would tell people to watch it.
2,The Island on Bird Street,it is one of the best DVD ever which deals with survival and give a vivide picture of a life which is not known to many young people today
3,Limitations and workarounds,"Have already reviewed this product on-line. Perhaps it was from the actual vendor - I couldn't tell. Upshot is that is seems to be relatively accurate, but limited. Ability to acquire the flag if hanging limp (from almost any distance) is is nil. Ability to acquire flag form beyond 135-140 yards is limited. Otherwise, quite useful from closer in. Workarounds are acquision of trees appearing visually to be +- 15 yards from flagstick location. Not a bad purchase for the price if you're willing to find a few workarounds. A reasonable complement to a GPS."
2,Bushnell Rangefinder,"I bought this laser rangefinder because it was listed as a golf rangefinder. The box has an illustration of a flag pin up to 200 yards. In reality you have to be well inside 100 yards, and the flag has to be extended by the wind.This model might work for huntng, but is of little practicle use for a golfer."
1,"Wonderful printer, but cannot use on many computers.",I have this printer and love it. Or used to love it. I just got a new computer which runs Windows XP. You cannot use this printer with a new computer because Canon has arbitrarily decided not to release printer drivers. Their nonsensical stated reason is that the printer does not support USB (universal serial bus). Windows XP could support this printer. It recognizes the printer as new hardware over the parallel printer bus and asks for a driver. Since Canon has decided not to support Canon products there is no usable driver. Canon has only released Windows 95/98 drivers.Do not buy this printer unless you are willing to keep around a Windows 98 computer with which to use it.I've bought my last Canon product.
1,Don't Purchase -- Canon Not Supporting,"I own a CD-300. The quality of the prints is quite good -- indistinguishable from a regular 35mm print. However, as another reviewer has stated, avoid this printer. Canon has announced that it will not develop a Windows XP printer driver for the CD-300. To add insult to injury, Canon announced today that it is producing a new 4x6 dye-sub printer, the CP-100, which I have no doubt will be XP-compatible."
4,Unique!,"A great little magazine with an artful history.It's a tiny, black and white, booklet that arrives in an envelope and is sure to please. All contributors must use aliases and submit content for the sheer pleasure of being creative. It is definitely a refreshing break from over produced magazines, fluff pieces, self promotion, logos and averts.NO adverts!If you want a small Discordian treat from an independent publisher that is creative, unique and collectible.I recommend this magazine!"
3,Hmmm...,"This magazine is sent through the mail in a envelope and is only like 4 inches long and 2 inches wide. Has around 20 pages with poems, stories, and pictures inside. I don't think I would buy it again. You can view the magazine online for free."
2,sad yomiko,photo makes it look much bigger and brighter than it really is. i was very disappointed and would not order it again.
5,Microsoft Notebook Optical Mouse 4000,"Great! The Microsoft 4000 mouse was suggested by my son after he purchased the same model, and I have been totally pleased with the product. This model has some helpful features for maneuvering around the desktop more quickly and more efficiently."
2,Limited range: 2 to 3 feet only,"Defeats the whole purpose of going wireless. The mouse itself is nicely constructed, but the only reason I bought this product was so that I could watch online tv episodes on my computer without having to get up from my bed. After each commercial, I hate to get up and hit the ""click to continue"" button in the networks' websites. If you don't mind the limited range, this mouse is actually quite good. The construction is solid and each button is very responsive. Microsoft just needs to increase the range from 6 to 10 feet, in order to truly call this product wireless. Hopefully, the Logitech wireless mice have better range than this product. A little disappointed with Microsoft for their shorcoming."
4,"Not bad, a tad small, but not bad","This isn't a bad mouse, it works with Vista just fine, and it really is plug and play. The scrolling is smooth, and I've not had any problems with the tracking. It seems like clicking the buttons requires a little more effort than my other mouse, but that'll just take time to get used to. The fit is a little small for me, and I'm a woman with smaller hands. It's ok if I kind of curl my fingers up a little bit or just rest my fingers on the buttons with my hand back really far, but that's not REALLY bad or anything. It doesn't hurt my wrist, and that's what's important!"
4,Nice little mouse,"Once you use a wireless mouse, you'll never want to use the mousepad again.I was using a full-size wireless mouse on an older laptop and decided to go for an actual notebook mouse for my new one. It's a lot easier to carry around and I find it comfortable to use, despite the smaller size.It doesn't quite have the range of the bigger mouse. However, the mouse is usually about a foot and a half from the receiver and I've only had one time where I had a connection problem. That was on a metal desk and the problem was solved by switching USB ports.The buttons are a bit stiff. but I've had no problems and the scrolling is very smooth. The only problem I've had is with the magnifier. It works great, but turning it off typically requires several tries. I installed the intellipoint software (on an XP laptop) and my son remapped the magnifier to the back button. I think he likes the old mouse a bit better, as it has two programmable buttons that he maps to forward/back for IE."
3,This mouse is very average.,"I have been using this mouse for about 3 months.Works great most of the time but there are a few issues:Positives:1) Packs great with no wires, base plugs into bottom of mouse.2) Battery lasts a long time.Negatives:1) Wireless range is not very good, 1-3 feet. I have to push the ""connect"" button on the bottom often to get it to sync. Works better when using on desktop but when on couch or bed connection robustness goes way down.Related to this the ""connect"" button is hard to press given how much I have to press it.2) The mouse wheel seems to hit the edge of the shell and binds up a little bit, Bad construction tolerances I guess."
3,It Does The Job,"I have wireless explorer mice that I use at work, and at home, and love them both! I wanted to get a smaller wireless mouse when using my laptop computer wirelessly, in bed.Here's my feedback on this item:1) Easy set up, only takes a few minutes.2) Wireless range is very good, no problems there.3) Size takes some getting used to. This is a small mouse and you'll feel some cramping in your hand/wrist after a while (I have a normal size hand).4) Left/Right buttons work just fine.5) Thumb button works well also.6) Wheel button does not work at all! It will scroll left/right, but will not work when pressed. That's too bad because like many others I use all the buttons on the mouse consistently.Overall, if your not concerned with the wheel-button's functionality, I would recommend this item."
2,Be ready to have this for a short time,"I purchased this mouse in early April 2008 and I used it all the time. On average I spend five hours a day on my laptop and have used this mouse each time. While I expected that the battery life would be long, I have to recharge the battery every two weeks. It really likes to give a low-battery warning by interrupting whatever program you're using to say ""Hey, it's time to recharge!"" Now in month #3, after several recharging and only taking this mouse to the outside world once, the strolling stopped working. No warning. I've plugged it in and out and it is still unresponsive. Only buy this if you can find a cheap deal on it. I was lucky to get this at $20, but even that is too much. I gave it two stars because when it worked, it worked fine."
2,Does not track well,"I bought this mouse thinking it would provide better tracking as it used ""laser technology."" However, it tracks very poorly on almost all surfaces. I have an older wireless mouse from Microsoft that is not a notebook mouse and does not use ""laser technology"" but does track a lot better than this mouse on almost all surfaces too.The extra button on the side of the mouse is also poorly placed as I am used to having extra side buttons closer to where your thumb can access it. As with all tilt wheel mouses it is sometimes difficult to middle click.Perhaps I received a faulty unit, but at this point I think I will try to return to Microsoft, if still possible. I purchased this mouse Christmas time of 2005."
1,MOUSE/VISTA,"Don't buy this product if you are running Microsoft Vista. Microsoft has certified this mouse, but it does not bear the "" works with vista"" tag. Now you tell me, Microsoft certifies it, but it does not ""work with"". Steer clear of this item for now. No Support that will enable its operation. Also Globazar vendor sells non -retail packaging, with their own typed up (and misspelled) directions. Product looks either reman or used to me. Hope this helps..."
2,Microsoft wireless Notebook Optical Mouse 4000,The Mouse is very user friendly.Easy to follow instructions for setting up.I would recommend this product to women as the hand fits beautifully over the mouse. All buttons are quick to respond to touch.
1,It worked.....for a couple of days. Next one never worked,"I've got a Dell Lattitude P4 C540/640 with XP Pro. The instructions say to install the software first, then the USB reciever...no problem...mouse comes up and works fine...for a few days. After that, nothing. Proceed to go through all the troubleshooting, remove driver, remove software, reboot, install software, install reciever...nothing. Press channel change button on reciever and mouse....nothing. Get a new one and nothing from the start. Test USB port with other USB devices, no problem. Returing this junk for something else. What a hassle."
2,If you want a true wireless this won't be it.,"The wireless receiver is very week on this device, my Gateway laptop USB port is on the left side of the laptop and mouse being used on the right side will not work due to weak signal only being a foot away. The documentation states that wireless range is up to 3'. I have to use a USB extension to be able to use it.The mouse have a very good cursor control, cool magnifier, and wireless receiver snaps under the mouse when not in use to turn off the mouse and saves battery."
1,Buy this only if you don't need a mouse that works,"It's hard to get a lot of use when the drivers don't load properely and as you use it, the signal periodically drops so the mouse jitters... don't buy it."
4,A Laptop must have,"This mouse takes the finger dragging out of using my Laptop, is simple and effective."
3,"Good enough, but much worse than 3000","I had Microsoft 3000 Wireless Mouse before and I was very satisfied with it, til I have broken my connector :( (Nothing with construction, it was my stupid fault). Than I have decided to buy newer one. MISTAKE... I mean it's not bad mouse it's working well, but compared to 3000 it's step back. The most annoying thing is wheel, this one doesn't have ""steps"" like it was by 3000 and if you wanna use it for clicking f.e. for opening new tab, you'll became crazy...so buying this mouse is not bad choice at all, depend on individual requirementsif you own 3000 and you're satisfied and now you're thinking about upgrading to 4000, DON'T DO IT... ;) you can be very dissapointed"
2,Not good enough (for me),"After reading a lot of reviews about this mouse, I was hoping this mouse would do me well, but YEAH RIGHT! The folks that said the distance range sucked were frank. I only used this mouse once and I'm about to return it. The mouse had to be at most 1 feet away from the USB receiver otherwise there was a short delay and the further away it was, the worst it got. Eventually you won't see the cursor on the screen. How lame is that?????? Its only good if you plan on using it very close to the laptop/desktop.In short, this mouse was utterly USELESS to me!!!!!!!!!!! End of story."
4,MS Notebook Optical Mouse 4000 works!,This MS Notebook Optical Mouse 4000 is a welcome unit because it is hard for me to get used to the laptop's touch pad. We use this mouse all the time.I discovered that the laptop would not go into screen-saver mode whenever the wireless mouse is attached. So I just remove it to prevent screen burn-in when running a long app.
4,Microsoft wireless optical mouse,"Microsoft Optical mouse is good and sleek model.I am using this mouse a lot.But one small disadvantage is, not receiving the signal more than one feet.except this everything is good."
5,Love the mouse,"Great mouse, easy to use; my only complaint is that it doesn't have built in forward and back buttons."
2,Nothing but headaches,"This mouse works well for a while, but every so often, it would stop working out of nowhere. This is really inconvenient when I'm in the middle of typing up a document, madly searching for something (thus making me lose my concentration), or playing games. The external device that connects to the USB port is bulky and takes up too much space, length-wise. I advise you to purchase another product."
3,Decent product,"The seller is actually very good, product arrived on time, in good condition.Product works well. Except on a few occasions its connection to the USB connector would not work, message 'Weak Signal', but it works next time you turn on the machine. Battery life is excellent."
5,Very Happy,I really enjoy this product. It was easy to set up and use and I would recommend it to anyone.
1,Save your money,"Microsoft Notebook Optical Mouse 4000--Dark Gray (B2P-00006)- mouse.This is the worst wireless mouse I have ever used.Very cheaply made, poor design all around.Battery compartment is flimsy and very hard to close/keep closed.In attempting to retrieve the reciever I accidently ejected the entire thing.Magnifier button placing is awkward and too easily triggered with simple use.I immediately asked for a refund."
3,Limited signal range,"I purchased this mouse because it was exactly what I was looking for, sleek lines, compact and it had many features. I received the mouse and soon realized that the signal range was very limited. I have an older laptop with only one USB port in the back left corner. This presents a problem because I am right handed and the signal will not travel the 12 - 15 inches to the receiver. When I tested the mouse on the left side of the computer it works fine, only problem is I'm not left handed. The manual says the signal should be good for up to 3 feet, I don't think so! The mouse is fine and I would loved to be able to use it. If you are looking to purchase this model make sure you have USB ports on the side of the computer that your power hand is on."
4,works well,I haven't had a problem with this mouse. It works pretty well. It's not as ergonomic as my current Logitec wireless laser mouse and it's a little bit tall (or thick) so that it kind of bulges out of my laptop case. But functionally it works fine.
4,Microsoft Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse 4000,"Small and easy to handle, more robust then the early model. The original battery lasted only for 1 week, replaced it with a E2 battery. It has a magnify button it alows you to magnify text or pictures, i find it very usefull."
4,Mouse does everything it is supposed to,"I purchased this mouse after I accidentally kicked the dongle for an older version in this series, killing my old mouse. This new mouse isn't as hefty, yet I have kicked the dongle a couple times, and it is still going strong. Also, it fits nicely in my hand, and the scroll wheel is super smooth.My only problem with the mouse is that sometimes it isn't immediately detected on my laptop, and I have to shuffle it around different USB ports to get it to show up. Of course, this could be a software problem rather than a hardware issue."
5,Great notebook mouse,"This mouse has a small size, convenient for use in a laptop bag. Great features and great size."
1,Too Small and Uncomforable,I received the Microsoft Notebook Optical Mouse 4000 the other day and my hand has gotten very sore. The mouse is too small even for a small hand and very uncomfortable to use. I think I will go back to Logitech.
4,bought this product because of past experience,"First bought a Jerdon wall mount about two years ago. It performed well until about a month ago when I burned it out by putting it on high and using it to dry inside a sweatshirt, where it couldn't get enought air flow. User error. The only difference I can see between this new one and that one is a small night lite (that I never used anyway).Mounting is quite easy, and it frees up counter/drawer space. My only wish is that it had individual settings for heat and speed. Medium and high heat settings are on high speed only.My wife also has one of the aforementioned original models, but only uses it for her hair, and it continues to work just fine."
4,Wall hair dryer,The product works very well and is priced modestly. I like having it mounted on the wall and then it isn't on the counter. It has three heat settings and two speeds. This is the second Jerdon wall mount hair dryer I have purchased.
3,Newer isn't better,"I had one of these for a number of years and loved it, However the new one I just purchased broke within one week. The holder broke and now its hard to put in and out of the Wall Mount. Another piece of crap."
3,"Does the job, but . . .",". . . feels cheap in the hand. Takes two hands to insert the dryer back into the holder, which is kinda awkward."
1,Not a good product,This hairdryer only worked for 2 months before burning out. I purchased another and same thing happened. Not a good product.
1,worked for only 2 months,"I purchased this dryer for my husband for X-mas it worked well for about 2 months and then started to spark at the cord. My husband took it apart and the cord inside was black,not good. Thank goodness it didn't start a fire!!"
4,Hair Dryer,This is a good solution when you want a wall mounted hair dryer. It frees up counter space in crowded bathrooms and provides enough air and heat to dry hair. Nice touch is the removable screen that catches air born dust. I have used this model before and typically get 2 to 4 years life.
5,Hair drying made easy,"I chose the Jerdon wall mount hair dryer because I had one previously and it lasted a very long time. I like a wall mount because it leaves my counter free for other items. This particular hair dryer takes very little wall space and fits in between the mirror and corner of the wall.My previous Jerdon dryer had a night light which I miss on this one, but wouldn't give a good hair dryer up simply for a night light.I enjoy my Jerdon wall mount hair dryer and would recommend it very highly.I'm also pleased with my business with Amazon. They are right on target with price and shipment."
4,Dries quickly but is loud,"Got this Jerdon from Amazon to replace an Oster with the same wattage. This dryer seems to dry my hair a lot faster, but......when doing the sides, it sounds like a jet airplane. It is VERY noisy, but you don't have to have it on as long, so I guess it evens out the pros and the cons. I would recommend this to a friend, but, I would advise them about the loudness of the dryer. It is a good dryer for the cost and I am not sorry I bought it."
1,Didn't Last 6 Months,"I bought this Jerdon Wall Mount Hair Dryer to save space and for company convenience. It was mounted in an upstairs bathroom and lightly used. The Jerdon hair dryer was purchased in August 2010 and quit working in March 2011. It's not a good idea to purchase electrical items on Amazon......After 60 days NO RETURN! If I had paid a little more and bought locally, I would have gotten my money back or another item. Sometimes when you think you are saving money, you're not. I lost all the way around. I will not purchase electrical items from Amazon in the future. Bad idea!"
2,Worked for awhile,I loved it...while it worked. It lasted about six months before it just ... died. First it quit working on high and then it quit working all together. I really like having a mounted hair dryer in my small space so I'll be looking for a new one. It simply won't be another one of these.
3,"Good design, but quality could be better.","Replacement for the first one, which had the fan blade fly apart during use. Cheap plastic fan blade where metal would be much better. It was out of warranty, and because I took the case apart to check for the problem, they would neither fix it or sell me the part to repair it. Since I now have one for parts other than the fan, and the hair dryer fit so well where I had it hung, I went ahead and bought another one. It is a good design, but the quality could be better when it comes to that fan. No problem with anything else, just that cheap plastic fan blade, in my case anyway."
1,Faulty hair dryer,This hair dryer was purchased as a Christmas gift to replace one we have had for several years. I could not locate one locally so I order from Amazon. The dryer only worked for a few days. Nothing I do will make it work again. The reason I have not retured it is because the postage cost would be so much.
2,written review,"I haven't used the product yet as I bought this is replace one just like it that was broken. Once I placed the new one on the old plate I realized the Jerdon company had shortened the power cord and it's too short to reach the outlet. So now we have to take down the plate, repair the wall, the move it over."
1,Try a different dryer,I purchased this dryer in July of 2005. On Feb 1 of 2006 this dryer sent out sparks and the coils inside were red hot. I used this once a day almost every day. I will not be buying another Jerdon hair dryer.
3,Hair Dryer,"A long time ago, this dryer was in a favorite hotel chain. I loved being able to push it back onto the wall without stopping to turn it off first. Today, there is more room on the counter with the dryer safe on the wall. The cord stays out of the sink, too!"
4,Great product,It's easy to install and works great. It's slim so it's easy to find a place for it. Now the blowdryer is one less thing taking up space in our bathroom
5,Love It!!,Used one of these at a hotel we stayed in last summer...loved it...had to have one. It arrived very quickly...great service.
2,very unreliable,"the jerdan dryer has given us a broken switch after just a couple months of use (has done this with 3 different dryers), i would not recomend this dryer to any one go for the sumbeam/oster a much better product"
1,Jerdon Wall Mount,This item has a wall mount with two flimsy plastic tabs that must fit into slots as the unit is put back into the wall mount. These tabs are so flimsy that they do not maintain the spacing to fit into both tabs. It is very difficult to get the unit back into the mount. Ours lasted only a couple weeks until one of the tabs broke off completely. The actual unit seems OK but we consider the mount a no go and would not buy this item again.
3,Not good!,"This product came to me already broken and is make of many cheap plastic parts. It perks coffee well but leakes as you try to pour the coffee from the pot when it is hot. It seems to leak from the plastic ring around the top. I'm not sure they make coffee pots that don't leak down the carafe when pouring the coffee into the cups. Too Bad, I hate all the cheap plastic that are put in products anymore."
1,Really Bad Product,"After reading mixed reviews on this product I decided to take a chance since the price seemed good. Upon reciept I plugged it in and the element overheated immediately. The fan did not work and smoke started coming out of it. Needless to say, after a long cool-down it went back in the box and was returned. Amazon was great refunding my money as I certainly didn't want a replacement. How it got a UL rating I'll never know. I suggest spending a few more bucks and getting a quality item."
4,Great Value!,"I like the design of the Jerdon Wall Mount Hair Dryer. It's compact and easy to install on the wall. The double buttons make it easy to use, too. The cons? The dryer doesn't have a ""cool"" setting, only high, med, and low, plus the electrical cord is very short and you must install it very close to the outlet."
3,Jerdon 1600w Wall Mount Hair Dryer,I owned a Jerdon previously and it had worked well. However it did not have as much air velocity as I wanted. I purchased this model hoping for more power. On the MED setting it does have more velocity than my older model however the air is only lukewarm and does not dry all that well. When I switch to the high setting I get very warm air but the velocity drops by 10 or 15%. I will probably reinstall the old one. Otherwise it should work fine.
4,wall mounted hair dryer jerdon 1600w,"this is a dream for someone that likes a clean bathroom counter with everything in it's place. Grab it and dry your hair/pops back on the wall! What could be easier for a quick morning routine? Keep it on the wall for safety reasons....no little ones can figure out how to reach it if you mount it in the proper location. Give yourself an extra bathroom drawer...and no one will ""borrow"" this one! enjoy ~~~~ :)chrissy"
1,Get the Sunbeam/Oster instead,"I used a Sunbeam wall-mount dryer for many years. When it died, I looked to find a replacement, but saw that Sunbeam had changed the design a bit. Fearing that they might have ruined the classic model, I bought this one instead because it looked in the picture like the former Sunbeam design.What a mistake. The Jerdon is clearly a poor knockoff of the original Sunbeam. It's bulkier and heavier. The catches that clip in the handset part don't latch positively like the Sunbeam did. Just about everything about this dryer seems inferior to the Sunbeam.The only thing that some people might like better is the heat level. This thing is HOT! If you're one who likes to start the day with a singe on your scalp, this is the dryer for you! In fact, the dryer is so hot, it CAUGHT ON FIRE after we owned it less than a year!So here I am on Amazon again to buy another dryer. But this time, I'll do the right thing and get the 1632 instead!"
1,What happened to great Jerdon 1600W dryer?,"I owned a Jerdon 1600W wall-mount dryer for 4 years till it finally died of every day normal usage. I then bought this $16.99 model from Amazon that was received DOA. My replacement dryer from Amazon lasted only one week till it went ""pop"" and smoked in my hand! Amazon won't send a third replacement but they did refund my credit card. I don't know if the other Jerdon 1600W dryer that Amazon sells at $34.95 is any better(?)."
3,hair dryer,This dryer was purchased to replace a like dryer.I was extremely disappointed to find this product had no night light.
1,Two months old and 2 of the 3 speeds quit!,I ordered this hair dryer the begining of August 2010 and it now only works on low speed. My box is long gone in the garbage and it is past my return refund date. Help!
2,Overheated!,"This unit overheated and blew out within a few uses. When it cooled down, only the low setting would work. I don't plan on buying another to replace it."
1,Don't buy - worked less than one year,"I really enjoyed getting my hairdryer off the countertop, but I'll have to do it with a different brand in the future. I purchased this unit 9 months ago. A few days ago, the switch stopped working for medium and high settings. I sent a note to the company via their website asking for assistance and haven't heard back from them. I'm sure they'll replace it under warranty, but why would I spend $10 in shipping for a $20 product to get what would probably be a refurbished model? I suggest you look at other options, which is what I'm going to do now."
1,Don't waste your $,This dryer was purchased in August 2010 and the contriol button became stuck in October2011 and the company won't fix or replace. This dryer is a piece of junk and should have lasted for a couple years at least. Called company and got no help at all. Will not buy Jerdon products again.
4,little but efficient hairdryer,"This hairdryer is just like you'd get in a resort or hotel. It's little, but efficient. I love that it goes on the wall, has cording just long enough to reach the outlet, and yet long enough for me to dry my hair upside down if I want. I almost always use the high setting, and my hair is dried in just a few minutes. It's got a clean boxy look instead of the usual elongated hair dryer shape and that looks better on my wall as well."
3,doesnt last,This is the second jerdon I purchased mainly because I wanted to keep the same holes in the wall. I won't buy another one. I think the first one lasted 2 years and this one just died after 2 years. thats crazy. yes I use it everyday but I still have my hair dryer from college that works beautifully (although a bit bulky) and its 30 years old. This hair dryer lasted 2 years!! thats ridiculous.
2,Enjoyed it while it lasted.,I bought it in Nov. of 2010 and it expired in July of 2011. I have had goldfish live longer. I was using it and it suddenly started smelling like burning rubber. I immediately turned it off. Now only the low setting works.I have very short hair and it was not used daily. Hmm.....
5,Olivia Newton-John Have You Never Been Mellow,"Ahhh, Olivia, what a sweet voice and what beautiful music."
3,More for high school than middle school,"I found the first 5 chapters very helpful but the last 14 were like a whole different book. In the later chapters I kept looking at the front cover to make sure I hadn't switched books to a high school ivy prep version. For those who plan on sending their kid to a local college it was overkill. The first part is very good on surviving the homework blitz, working with binders, study secrets. So read the first 5 chaps and then pick selectively out of the later chapters depending on your child's age."
4,Parental help,"I purchased several books from Amazon.com on this topic, and found that this one by Michele Hernandez was the most thorough & helpful. I recommend it if, you too, are seeking to help your child get organized & receive the most from his or her middle school (and beyond) years."
1,Dangerous!,"This book is written in an offhand, casual way and uses unofficial maps that do not provide clear guidance. Our family including 2 young kids misread an instruction and ended up lost in NY's Harriman State Park. We came close to spending the night in the park, if we hadn't had our cell phones, coverage, and a very helpful ranger available who came to our rescue at nightfall. The ranger said he had rescued many (tens) of people from the park who had used this book and that his office had called the publishers to address the issue. I recommend that you DO NOT USE THIS BOOK."
3,"Outdated, but useful","I've taken some awesome hikes with my kids based on this book. I've also gotten incredibly frustrated and lost, when the information on the page and the reality on the ground have diverged completely. Since this book was originally published in 1992, the far Western Catskills have experienced several devastating floods that have closed some roads and trails for good. So get this book -- but triple check everything online before you set out to hike."
4,"The best ""best of"" for Hot Chocolate","IMHO, this is the best collection of Hot Chocolate tracks. I give it 4 stars because there is a bit of filler, but it's highly enjoyable. Even the sad songs have catchy melodies and great rhythms! Standouts are You Sexy Thing, Every 1's A Winner, It Started With A Kiss, Girl Crazy, and Emma. No Doubt About It (about a UFO visit!) is fun, and their (original) version of Brother Louie is definitely worth hearing.For a collection focused just on Hot Chocolate's 1970s stuff, check out ""Best of the 70's - Hot Chocolate"".Note: the amazon listing of this disc leaves off the last 8 tracks. They are:12. I Gave You My Heart (Didn't I)13. You could Have Been a Lady14. Disco Queen15. Don't Stop It Now16. A Child's Prayer17. What Kinda Boy You Looking For (Girl)18. I Believe (In Love)19. Are You Getting Enough Happiness"
3,"Good Review of Psychology Subject, could use more info","This review book was good preparation for the AP test, but it lacked some information. It gives relatively in depth reviews of each topic, and it will prepare you sufficiently for the AP. But, if you are looking for that 5 on the AP, you better have some other material, like class notes or packets of some sort on the subject at hand. However, if you need to get a lot of studying done in a little time, it is perfect. It doesn't take long to go through and it is concise and fact packed. I thought it was a great review, but i also used my course notes to study."
4,Four Stars... for the score I got on the AP Psych Exam,"I highly recommend this for anyone taking this AP exam. I didn't even take Psychology this year(I took Human Relations) but I figured I'd take a crack at the Exam. It's broken down into sections just like the Psychology textbook. It's easy to understand and gives helpful hints that allow you to process and understand the information rather than just read. The practice exams were just like the real thing, even a little harder. The essay rubric makes writing the AP essay like riding a bike(with training wheels)! Any questions email me ehatter@interactive.net. THANKS"
5,Great Book to Score Well on the AP Psychology Test,"Barron's AP Psychology is all you will need for preparation for the AP test or simply to review for tests in your AP class. The book is divided into sections with review questions after each section to make sure each concept is thoroughly understood. Careful reading and review through this short book helped me score a 5 on my AP Psychology test this past year, even though our teacher did not prepare us at all for the test. This book covers every topic for the AP test and unlike the Princeton Review or REA books, Barron's does it in a detailed enough manner without overwhelming you. I highly recommend this book for AP class tests and/or for the AP test."
5,all you need,I took the AP back in 2002/2003 and my AP psych teacher wasn't up to par. This book is fairly thin but don't be fooled. I read this book from cover to cover and came out with a 5 on the AP. My friend went into the AP with what the teacher taught (nothing) and came out with a 2.
4,wipes,"They work well for what they are intended to do. They dry out quickly once taken from the container, so use quickly."
1,Salon Products Lousy Return Policy with Zero Customer response,"I ordered these wipes by mistake. I contacted the vendor via email and questionned their return policy--which is basically, you can't return anything. The wipes are un-opened and in the original packaging. They never responded. I'm stuck with $18 worth of pet wipes that I could have gotten at PetsMart for $6."
3,The Writing Felt Very Neptunish!,"I thought this book about Neptune was not as clear as it could be. Lol. I think being immersed in the subject of Neptune affected the writing of it.The author breaks down Neptune by house and aspect, but I feel the writing trailed off a lot. I like crisp writing--say what you want to say and then stop.I think this book is of value, however, especially for the beginning astrologer."
2,Disappointed!,Expected more from the author. His pluto transit book was wayyy better.I was interested only in neptune transit eigth house and ninth house...both sections were not depthful enough.
2,Just excerpts,"Beware, this is just a highlights cd compiled from other cds in the Valois catalog. So you don't get complete works, just a movement of this and that. Better to find the cds from which they came."
3,Apocalyptic story,"""An interesting French novel published during WWII was Ravage (1943) translated as Ashes, Ashes in 1967.The disapperance of electricity turns France rural.""--The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction"
1,Do not buy for Sony Camera,Will not work in a Sony Camera. Sony puts a chip in their cameras that prevents any non-Sony battery from working.
5,An incredible collection of women's spiritual writing!,"I was very impressed by the stories included here--Anne Lamott, Maya Angelou, Natalie Goldberg, Kim Chernin...etc. These are not dry stories about spirituality--but rather transformative tales about how these women writers are changed by their travel experiences. Very inspirational and illuminating-read this book."
4,Very good,I believe I got my money's worth out of this book. The stories were very interesting! It tells stories of women from different faiths.
2,Very Uncomfortable,"This product worked very well except for one major problem. The earpiece was very uncomfortable (painful) - despite attempts to get use to it. Every time I moved my neck, the earbuds would jam against the inside of my ear. I tried silicone earbud covers which for a short time worked great, but the ST1 earbuds are not standard size, unless you remove the surrounding rubber. Removing the surrounding rubber was a bad idea as it held together the earbud assembly and was actually glued on. Eventually one of the earbuds no longer worked, due to my attempts use silicone covers."
3,Works fine but is quite uncomfortable,"The headset works fine with my LG VX8300 phone (calling and listening to the music) and both Windows Vista and XP systems (as a stereo headset). There are not that many choices on the market when it comes to stereo Bluetooth phone headsets and this is probably the best one. However, I find it quite uncomfortable. Especially when sitting in front of the computer and looking up and down from the keyboard or desk to the screen and back. Since the back part rests on the neck such movements make the buds to move as well and either pop out or pinch the ears."
1,Very Disapointing,"I received this product as a gift and was very excited. As noted in other reviews, the comfort is lacking as the earbuds are too large for my ears.However, the bigest problem that I have is that the battery life is very very short. I have had the unit for a month and can only listen to music for 53 minutes and 32 seconds (yup, I timed it.) before it shuts off.In addition, you only get 500 charges out of the unit (per instruction manual). So I am expecting that the unit will be totally disfunctional within the next month or so.$80 for headphones that you can use for a month until they break is not a very good deal."
4,Great figure,"She is pretty detailed and fits in her Eta2 Jedi Starfighter (the ship featured in ROTS). Her arms do not articulate at the elbows but great figure other than that. If you're looking for something with a little more detail, go for the vintage figure line."
3,"Great Figure, Not So Great Weapon","Don't get me wrong, the figure itself is excellent. My low review has nothing to do with the main figure. Aayla Secura comes with lots of points of articulation, which allow you to play with her and put her on her stand with your choice of pose. The stand is fantastic and is excellently sculpted, much like the figure. My problem with the figure is that the lightsaber can be removed from the hilt and, after only a few times removing it, the stub that connects the beam to the hilt snapped off, making it impossible to put the two back together without using glue. This is also not an isolated incident, as it happened to my friend, too. If you want a great figure and do not care about the weapons, but this, but if you want the weapo9n to last long, pick another figure."
5,Awesome Jedi,Aayla Secura is a very good jedi to have for the collection. Her legs are extremely flexable and she can move very easily. Her details are top notch and is very durable.
5,Easy enough for a complete gas grill novice!,"Before last weekend, I'd never used a gas grill, let alone put one together.The assembly instructions were generally clear and easy to follow. The propane tank lifts easily off and on the fuel gauge.Cooking with it was a blast! It lights up easily and heats up very quickly, yet doesn't burn your food. I cooked (with a bit of creative arranging) 6 chicken leg quarters, 5 ears of corn on the cob (in the husks) and 2 giant vegetable shish-ka-bobs.The temperature gauge in the lid of the grill that doubles as a meat thermometer is ingenious.I grew up on charcoal, but I'll never go back. The beauty of dumping the little drain tray out once it's cooled (hint: put it in the dishwasher and get a few more uses out of the disposable tray) as well as not alternately burning/undercooking the food has made me a Weber gas grill convert for life.It was an entirely pleasant cooking experience and the grill is beautiful to look at to boot!"
5,Malibu Outdoor Six-Light Floodlight Kit,A very good option for low wattage outdoor floodlight system and what an amazing price.I probably will buy another one within a month.Great product and easy to install myself. Everything works great.
3,true Java from years back,not up to date because of the pub. date but authentic. An historical approach that shows migratory and native influences. Good for architect or designer or traveler to get a feel for man made influences of design elements.
1,Simply Amazing.,"What this DVD is lacking in content, is more than made up for on the cover. I mean, just look at how well done the case is. A beautiful white American family, Old Glory waving in the background, a Chinese statue and a few Muslims bowed in prayer to show our diversity. Amazing stuff.It's a shame this DVD's current rank is only about 236,000. I would easily put this in the top 225,000 DVDs I've come across this year.As for the content, I can't really say as I haven't watched it. But having this laying around your house for all to see will definitely give you some patriotic and Christian street cred. That in itself is worth the cost of admission."
3,"Ok, but metal pieces rust easily","I bought this to use at the gym. Unfortunately, the little grommet that goes around the hole at the bottom to drain the water out rusts. Anything I've had in the basket has gotten rust stains on it.If you don't plan on getting it wet, it's a great little caddie. It folds flat into my bag, but expands large enough to carry full size bottles of shampoo and conditioner, plus soap, shaving cream cans, razor, deoderant, lotion, powder, and a washcloth. And it has room to spare."
4,great for the price,"for the price- at approximately one for around five bucks each, these are great. As a college student, it's super helpful for the shower, drains ok and is cheap. However, don't expect to high a quality- the metal frame of the rim started poking out a month or two in, but it's perfectly usable and I have a second one if the first one breaks. Mine both came in blue."
3,Good enough microwave...not a very good toaster or combo,"Make sure you keep the instruction manual close by! You CANNOT just figure this thing out without the manual..there are too many variances involved, and absolutely no labeling. If someone else decides they want to use it, they will probably end up asking you how (why not just cook it yourself...ugh) The other problem: If you are using it as a toaster oven, forget pizza, or anything that you would like toasted/cooked on the bottom as well, it doesn't have the capability. The oven has a child lock out option-although I think they could just as easily ""accidentally"" turn off the lock out:( This microwave grill/combo is fine for the occasional user, to heat up food, cook a couple of potatoes or to pop a bag of popcorn. The other reviewer was right though, be careful of times, cooks fast for me too."
2,"It's a microwave ONLY, Don't buy","This oven looks great, is a little big. It has to be dialed for the times, you can't just punch in 3min 30 seconds. Not the worst thing. The worst is it's only a microwave. The ""toaster"" is a joke. It's the same thing as the ""oven"" with a wire rack. A broiler element comes on from the inside top and within 3 minutes will turn your slices of bread to hardened bricks. The bread is not edible. It's as if you'd microwaved it and then tried to dry it out in an oven overnight. The ""oven"" is the same broiler element only and will also ruin any dinner rolls you might have put in a small toaster oven. I didn't want to pay to send it back, but should have! I ended up having to buy a small toaster oven from Target to do the two jobs I was told this one would do. I could have bought a nice looking, well made microwave for a lot less money and the same toaster oven. Big mistake. Live and learn. Don't buy the combo machines, they can't do it all."
5,Neat Microwave/Toaster/Grill,I have an EXTREMELY small apartment and needed three appliances in one and this SANYO pulls through. It does everything well. Highly recommended!
2,Can't beat the laws of physics -- bought and returned,"When I saw the combo microwave/toaster over thought that it was too good to be true. With a kitchen that always has one too many appliances on the counter, and with an aging microwave that should be moved to the office I was really looking forward to the product.There were two problems that made me send it back before trying it out: the size and no toast.Apparently because of the heat generated in grill mode the unit needs from 2 inches (side) to 8 inches (top) of clearance and that meant I could not find a place in my kitchen for it.Also, the grill seems more a grill than a toaster; I actually use a toaster over for toast and it doesn't seem designed for such purposes."
4,Nice for the price,"New technology, very nice, but read the manual. Nothing beter than a counter top appliance that does more than one thing. This is the microwave of the future."
3,Handy for microwave but limited grill use,It is nice product for day to day microwave features. A short grill stand makes the grilling very time consuming.
1,Someone Messed Up,"The microwave we ordered did not operate properly when we received it. Apparently someone in the process of dealing with this particular unit did not take time to notice that it had been sent back already by another customer due to the same problems we encountered. So, when it arrived for us, nothing had been done to correct the problems that had been reported by the other customer. We were very disappointed with the product and the service. We did get a refund on the product, but due to the fact that we live out of the country we had additional shipping expenses which Amazon did not cover although it was their mistake. We won't be ordering appliances from Amazon again!"
1,bad support,"I had a bad luck. My unit went bad because of a power surge during a storm. I sent it to the authorized service station in a hope to have it repaired. (It was under the warranty period). I got the microwave back from the service shop in an unrepaired state. It is lying in my store, and will probably get rid of it during my next house cleaning. Not sure why they made it such thata power surge could literally make the microwave useless. Sanyo just could not fix it."
5,One GREAT microwave!,"A stainless steel microwave and a grill for $99.00. You can't go wrong with this unit. Works great, looks great and inexpensive too. What a great microwave... thanks to whomever invented this."
1,Lasted only one month,"Oh well. I wasn't very pleased with it anyway. It was slower in microwaving than my old one, and the toasting feature took forever. Mine lasted one month, I touched the door handle and opened the door, the power went out on it AND it tripped my breaker. I reset the breaker, but the microwave had no power... just dead.I would have had to drive an hour each way to an authorized service location, leave it, and drive an hour each way another day to pick it up. So for what I was going to spend to get it ""fixed for free under the warranty"", I could just buy a new microwave... which I did. This one goes in the trash."
1,Only lasted one year!,"Beware -- just as other reviewers experienced, my oven suddenly and irrevokably stopped working, and just outside of its one year warranty. Consider not buying this, because it's possible Sanyo is using defective materials. I went to a local electronics store, and after I described the problem, they said it was likely due to a malfunctioning magnatron and could not be fixed. I agree with the other reviews: it's pretty, it's a good microwave while it actually works, and it doesn't toast well. But the cheap price isn't worth it because I have to replace it after only one year."
3,"Great microwave, not-so-great grill","While the microwave works really well and looks cool too, I've yet to have any success using the grill feature. It doesn't seem to get hot enough to actually grill things to a decent temperature without taking a long time to do it. This was disappointing to me because it's the whole reason why I purchased it."
2,Fine cooking; poor design,"I think this microwave cooks, as a microwave, just fine. I don't try to have it do anything else. My complaints about it are its increment button which does 30 seconds until you reach 2 minutes and 30 seconds, then goes to minute increments, and so on. If the dial actually worked, I wouldn't mind that so much, but (and perhaps I just got a flimsy one) the dial on mine no longer works properly (lasted about a year, I think) and so it takes much patience to get to the cook time I want. Also, the defrost settings are limited (20, 40, 60, and 80%). AND, I just learned recently, and this is probably kinda petty, that Sanyo emblem on the front is rough on the knuckles if you're not careful wiping down your counter!"
1,Gift Disappointment,"Bought this for my sister for Christmas and it broke within a month. Completely unusable. Very expensive, worthless, counter-space hog. Great in theory, but not in practice... at least not this specific one I purchased. Maybe I got a dud."
2,Worked OK for 1 Year Then Died,Worked OK for a year them one morning it was dead. Not a long life and not worth repairing.Grill never worked that great either. So ended uo using my toaster oven instead.
1,Doesn't work!,"We got this as a gift. It worked just under one year. We called Sanyo for some customer service but their ""service"" was a joke. I asked if maybe there was a setting we accidentally triggered or a reason it wasn't heating, if they knew anything - nope! They didn't care because our ""warranty"" was no good anymore (even though it stopped working in under a year).The fan and light still work, so it looks like it's working but never heats anything. It is a piece of junk. We are now going to buy a microwave but we will never buy or keep anything from Sanyo again!"
1,JUNK!,I purchased this in April of 2007 from Best Buy for 89.99 and in June of 2008 it went up. Saved the box but nobody will give me a refund since it has been just over a year. The only thing I liked about it was the way it looked. Do not buy this junk! Spend a little more money and get a better microwave that will last a long time.
3,Battle of Midway,"I have read extensively about the Midway battle. The program seems to be historically accurate. The video quality leaves a lot to be desired in terms of exposure, scratches and, what appears faded film."
4,The best for the money,"I have used the FS2710 for over a year and find it to be the best for the money IMHO. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is the 3.2 Dymanic Range. I have used the scanner to scan litterally hundreds of slides, both mounted and in strips, without any problems what-so-ever. The scanner was simple to install, the software works flawlessly. All of my images on my site were made with this scanner. Instead of just taking someones word for it, look and judge for yourself."
3,"You will get tough with this scanner in W2K, but it works","As another reviewer said, right, you may not install this thing in Windows 2000 successfully with normal installation process. First of all, you should get something like ASPI driver for your SCSI card, install it. Then let Windows 2000 treat your scanner as an other/unsupported device while Windows 2000 detect it automatically. After that, install the utility come with this product or downloaded from support site. It should work then although Windows 2000 always see it as an other/unsupported device in device manager.Except this strange behavior, it is good but slow."
2,Good for Beginners,"I've just started scanning film, and after setup, this scanner is very simple to operate. However, if you are either inexperienced with installing hardware and/or software, or are looking to scan slides, I would suggest a different scanner. Personally, I believe a flatbed with a film scanning adapter is comprable in quality.I do have Windows 2000, and managed to get this scanner working on it, although it claims it doesn't have the components to install the driver on my OS. But that's definitely not something you want to deal with, if you can help it.You need to have photo editing software to adjust the scans properly. It sometimes has the tendency to turn out a little orange.Software included: Acquisition program, Adobe Photoshop Limited Edition (an extremely LIMITED edition), Presto! PhotoAlbum, Presto! Mr. Photo (basically, to arrange your personal photos- I did not install them, so cannot recommend)."
2,DO NOT GET THIS SCANNER IF YOU HAVE WIN 2000,"DO NOT GET THIS SCANNER IF YOU HAVE WIN 2000.......I have this scanner it does a good job and all works perfect on Win98, however if you have Win2000 its a waste of time to own this thing. I'm very upset I didnt research this thing before I bought it. Canon has drivers for Win2000 but they dont work at all. I may add that there support cost's money and they give you no imput. Otherwise if you dont have Win2000 I would say its pretty good. I have now a spearate PC just for this thing with Win98 on it. There are probably better scanners out there. This thing takes pretty long to scan a single negative at maximum reseloution. And I have found that Kodak color negative's does not scan as nice as Fuji will with this scanner. But it does work good if your scanning any slides. I hope this is helpful to you........I would say get a different one."
3,No support,Good product (3 stars) but no driver available for use with Windows XP. I found this out when I moved from a Windows '98 system to an XP system. Planned obsolescence from our friends at Canon.
3,"Serves the Purpose, and is not bulky.","I needed a sweater dryer for my sweaters. I bought two. This item is handy, but I modified it so I can easily put a sweater on top and bottom. As is, it's a little difficult to put a sweater with all five strips attached. I cut one strap, top and bottom and used velcro to reattach and it works well. This gives me plenty room to place large sweaters to dry. I like the idea that I can fold it up and hang when not in use."
2,I returned it,"I don't normally write reviews, but this one I felt like needed a little more info - the idea of it was nice but I can't believe they actually put velcro on this item. It's a sweater hanger... the first time I tried to use it my sweater stuck to the velcro and pulled. If you truly plan on hanging up sweaters I think this is a deal-breaker. Also it is awkward to try to get items on the mesh platform anyway."
2,Not as pictured,"Misleading. The picture on the packaging matches the one on the website. However, upon opening the package, I discovered the product did not match the image. The pictured hook is not included. Instead, they have attached the sweater dryer to a carabiner which cannot be mounted onto a shower rod by itself. I used a cheap wire hanger to get around this. Be forewarned of this extra inconvenience."
2,Ring Doesn't Fit,"The hook that is supposed to fit any pole did not fit my shower rod pole so I had to hang it from a fixture, now I will have to drill a hole in the ceiling and attach a hanger for it. My XL sweaters didn't fit on it as well either - the concept was great, but it's just a little too small both in size and the hook."
5,Love the Hanging Mesh Dryer!,"I have two little boys who tore up my previous mesh air dryer. It was one that rested on a flat surface, and my boys couldn't keep their hands or feet off of it! I am so happy to have discovered one that hangs in my closet! It fits perfectly in my closet, and the two levels are exactly the amount of space I need to air dry certain pieces of clothing."
4,almost perfect,"This drying rack is almost perfect. I was looking for something that didn't take up any floor space and this is a great option. The only problems with it are: 1. the d-ring that it comes with did not fit over my shower bar and 2. the circles could be a bit bigger. As far as the d-ring is concerned - I went to a home improvement store and purchased an s-hook meant for closets (much larger than regular s-hooks) and that problem is solved. As for the rings - they are a bit small (even for medium clothes), but can fit with a little creativity. I would recommend this product."
5,Perfect for my wool diaper covers,I bought this to dry my wool diaper covers after washing and lanolizing them. I love it! It's much bigger than it looks in the picture. Those must be extra large sweaters because it has plenty of surface area. It also folds up really tiny. It twists and folds (like a spring float) and has a built-in elastic band to keep it secure. Amazing item for the price!
4,Hanging Sweater Dryer,"good buy, works well and it's pretty large. since I can dry two sweaters at a time it's great."
5,double sweather dryer,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She really likes it. It beats having to wash sweathers and have them get out of shape. Would recommend this.
5,Fits crib/changer combo!,"We have a combination crib/changer (Delta Delaney) and the changing table is smaller than standard size. The pad it came with was extremely thin but we had trouble finding something to replace it with because all the pads sold in stores were too big. This one fits! It's wedged in pretty tightly so I didn't use the straps that are included for securing the pad to the table. Although this pad is smaller than most, standard covers fit fine (we have Carter's Super Soft Dot covers). This pad seems thick and cushy, and I like how the 4 sides make a ""cocoon""."
2,Not durable - rips easily,"Nice sized, well padded, changing pad...but it is not durable. This changing pad ripped after only a few months of use. We don't even use it for every diaper change, as it's a secondary changing area for us. By another one, and if possible avoid a vinyl covering, since it seems from reviews of other vinyl covered changing pads that they all tend to rip easily."
5,Very good product,"It's as advertised. It holds my squirming active baby. I do not use it with a changing table though, I just place it on my bathroom counter."
4,Seems very large,"Maybe it's just me but this pad seems very large. It takes up the entire top of our dresser with no room to spare. I had planned on being able to set diapers and wipes on the top of the dresser as well but this pad doesn't leave a single inch of space. Obviously baby will grow and will need a bigger pad than a newborn, but even then this pad seems enormous. It arrived in good condition and our cover fits it, so I suppose it's working out just fine for now."
4,Just what we needed.,"This pad was purchased mainly for it's small size. All the other contour pads were 31"" to 34"" long, much too long for what we needed. This 30"" four sided contour changing pad is much smaller, and as an added bonus, much safer. I really like having all four sides contoured to prevent scooting off the back as ""Baby"" starts learning to push with his feet. We customed made a changing table so we do not have side rails, but even if we did, the four sides prevents babies from hitting their heads against the rails. This is my third child and my first experience with the four sided pad.Although most changing pad covers are designed for the two-sided contour pads, I found that they fit this pad just fine. We bought two covers designed for the 31"" two-sided contour pad and they fit rather well. There is no gapping or pulling.Overall, I am very pleased with the pad."
4,It works and the price is right.,"We ordered this instead of picking up a more expensive changing pad available in a local store. It fastens down to furniture (we put it on a dresser) well so it doesn't slide around, and the straps to buckle down the baby so he/she doesn't roll out of it while you are trying to wipe poop off your hands are handy.It wasn't as plush as the one we could have bought locally, and doesn't come with a cover. We have ended up leaving it bare vinyl anyway because it's easier to clean, although I think the baby would like it better if it was soft."
3,"Ok, so they work as glasses...","Fragile! One broke in the dishwasher.14 ounces? Doesn't that mean a can of soda would easily fit inside it? Not a chance. These slim tall glasses hold, at best 8 oz.They look larger in the photo than they are, and the misleading volume info suggests they ARE larger. They're kind of small, actually. The opposite rim mashes my nose when I drink with it, whereas the rim on a larger glass would spare me. Ok, maybe MY FACE could use some reconfiguring...Otherwise, nice design, and they sparkle."
5,These glasses are so pretty,"They will look so pretty on the table. Not as heavy as they appear to be but by no means flimsy, thin glass either. I just love them. I bought an open box set & got a screaming deal but I like them so much I'd be willing to pay full sticker for them."
1,The WORST book there is!,"I think 2 stars rating for this book are more than it deserves.I've bought many technical books and learned them on my own butI've never seen a book that is so bad. Having this as class textbook and coupling with a not so good instructor, you really getsit coming. PLEASE, STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!there many good books on this subject out there, don't tortureyourself and waste money on this terrible book. The bottom line is, theauthor tries to make subjects more complicated than theyreally are."
1,very misleading,I am very disappointed in the DVDs I purchased. 15 different supposed super bowl collection series DVDs. A series in which a different super bowl was what the cover depicts for each team. THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS then it gives the number of the super bowl in roman numerals. Other have Americans game the SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP and shows the ring on the cover. Did I miss something? Would that mean the game is what the DVD is about? Wrong the only super bowls I have received in their eternity are the two Broncos' super bowls of the Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII that came along with the 1977 AFC Championship Game in a three set entitled the Broncos 3 greatest games. Said nothing about super bowl games. The only reason I knew the super bowl games were included was I had researched it on another website what I should have done for these. All very misleading. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning 13 DVD. Very disappointed.NFL Super Bowl XLV: Green Bay Packers Champions
5,greenbay packers,i live inoshkosh wis.about 40 miles from greenbay.i am a great fan of the packers.we brought the lombardi trophy home where it belongs.
2,"Great Season, disappointing DVD","Though I am a born and raised Cheesehead and am still amazed that they pulled it off with so many injuries, I am very disappointed in this season wrap up DVD/Blu-ray. You can tell that this DVD was edited and done prior to the Super Bowl, the only thing that needed to be added was the highlights of the SB and post-game celebration. There are ZERO (yes, that's right, zero) player or coach interviews on this DVD during the season highlights. You only get Greg Jennings ""mic'd up"" during the playoff run. All bonus features are prior to the SB. This is one of those things that NFL films rushed out as quickly as possible to make a buck. My guess is that there will be another DVD later that actually has player and coach interviews that talk about the season and post-SB reaction. Watched it once, and sold it on eBay. The 1996 SB video is so much better, no comparison."
2,"Not for those EXPECTING a copy of XLV, it year's HIGHLIGHTS to XLV","Well, I bought, and expected some how a commercial FREE copy of the SUPERBOWL XLV game. It is not. What it is, is a great Summary of the Packer's Season which lead to the SUPERBOWL XLV victory. It is a wonderful look back of how an underdog team, beat the Odds and came out on top. Luckily the opponents made some costly errors, as did the Packers. But we were in the right place at the right time to capitalize on those errors and score the winning touchdowns. So, sit back and enjoy the ride, over teams like the AWFUL CHICAGO BEARS and against the Dreaded Minnesota VIKINGS and former Packer Bret Favre. It IS AARON ROGERS season and ability all the way. With an assist by some second and third string HEROES! A wonderful keepsake of a great season, with lots of surprises and disappointments, leading to the very top!"
3,"5 star season, 3 star highlight film","Having been a Packer fan for a while I own the 1996 SB champs video on VHS. I think the 96' highlight film is directed much better than this one. Reason I say this is the audio. Whereas the old tape featured well-orchestrated music which helped to dramatize the action on the field the backround music on this one is dull. Still, if your a Packer fan, this DVD is great to watch due to the content."
5,Great gift for Packer fan!!,"Put this in a ""popcorn bucket"" with snacks and a GB Packer ornament -Very surprised and happy to give giftGreat price - recd in good time and good condition (as described)I would order from this seller again."
5,History repeats itself,"This book is a must for any serious student of end time events from SDA perspective. The author tells a shocking story how Eastern mysticism (early New Age movement) tried to infiltrate SDA Church around 1902. The lessons of this book are invaluable for SDAs trying to evaluate current trends in SDA Church such as the use of NLP, hypnosis, rock/gospel music, spiritual formation, celebration, ecumenism etc. I congratulate Mr Walton for his courage to write such a timely book as this."
1,Don't Order This,DO NOT BUY. What a disappointment and a total waste of money. The shoes are not the color on the photo. They hurt my feet. This product was from a third party which does not provide any custmer service. I tried from within two days of receiving the shoes to return them. No shipper was included from the third party. I contacted Amazon. Amazon sent me a return slip. I returned them. Amazon returned the shoes back to me. I called Amazon at least six times over this five week period. Amazon finally had the third party contact me after messing with this for six weeks of silence and then the third party said it was past the 30 day period and I could only exchange them. Don't waste any money or energy with OnlyModa. There are much better shoes & customer service out there.
2,Don't read this book,"Unless you are burning to know more about Mr Rabinow. The book reads more like a justification for Rabinow's ethnographic failure than like reflections upon his experiences. Much better examinations of the fieldwork experience are available. Nevertheless, Rabinow does have an interesting style and sense of drama which makes for a not unpleasant reading experience. Were the title not so misleading I would like the book better but it should really be known as ""Reflections on my Failure as an Ethnographer in Morocco."""
5,Great Contemporary Spoof,"Kudos to the studio, actors and crew for a creative storyline. A spoof of everything Chinese. A classic story of switched personalities through some misfortunate events. A comedy of mistakes as each person searches for their proper identities and proper lovers and proper families. A story often told in many cultures this movie pulls out all sorts of creative conundrums to be resolved by our misplaced individuals. Be alert for the contemporary allusions e.g. a rap scene finding it's way into the mix."
1,Worst book in the World!!!!,"This book was aweful, hard to follow, and had no plot what so ever. Trust me it's a waste of time to read it."
3,not as expected,"It came with in 2 days after order w/o expediting it. Packaging is nice. The bulb is blue but the light it emits is not. This is not the first time I ordered a light bulb. (I installed HID on my mazda3 and that was nice, got Halo icis blue halogen bulbs for the fogs and that was blue). So I want to install this plasma glow for my 2011 pilot for running lights. I installed the driver side first and left the stock bulb on the passenger side, compared the light and there is not much of a difference, it is a little less yellowish than the stock bulb. If you are looking for a white or bluish bulb, this is not it. I bought this because of the good review the first two had given. Not blue nor white."
3,Mediocre,The mouse was much too small for my hand and my girlfriend's hand. Its quite uncomfortable to use for more than 15 minutes - but it is small.I ended up giving this to her and buying a Logitech VX Revolution instead...what a difference! The VX Revolution is about 2x the price but well worth it.
2,wireless mouse,"Not very good for a house with impatient people. It was a little sticky at first, by the time I contacted seller, they broke it."
1,Tendonitis causer,"First off I think this mouse looks great, which is why I bought it, but it is a horrible product. Within a half hour of using it I had shooting pains going up my arm. I had gotten tendonitis about a year ago which I was able to trace to the use of a different ""ergonomic"" microsoft mouse. It hurt for a long time but had pretty much gone away until I tried this ms mouse. After about a half hour I had pretty severe shooting pains. I think that it was mostly caused by how hard it is to push the buttons on it unless your fingertips are at the end of the buttons on the front of the mouse. I returned it yesterday and got a Logitech Lazer V450, which is a fantastic mouse."
3,Good stuff,"Microsoft finally releases a laser mouse !! and its worth the wait. smooth scrolling wheel, good reading of surfaces, and ability to turn off mouse (switches off automatically when you snap in USB wireless adaptor onto underside of mouse)woohoo !"
4,Good Product,it a good mouse the only time it bothers you is when you are a touch person. it isn't that hard to press the buttons but if ur really sensitive then yes it is compared to other mice but all around it is a good mouse
1,Microsoft notebook mice suck,I bought the non laser wireless version for notebooks and it just stopped working after about two weeks. I was about to buy this laser model and then I read the reviews and figured that the reliability disease carried over to the laser model. Stay away!
4,Works fine,"I have owned this mouse for 2 weeks; so far no problems. After plugging it in, it takes 5 seconds for it to ""find"" itself, and after that it is fine. Maybe 1 out of the last 50 times I've used it, it loses its signal, and takes 5-10 seconds to ""find"" itself again. But this is rare."
1,Absolutely Terrible!,"This mouse has great features and software. However, it's made very cheap. The housing is very weak and the battery compartment keeps popping open on its own. Clicking does not always work. The buttons creak like you're bending them instead of getting a distinct click. Finally after having it for only 1 month the scroll wheel quit working. The cursor was also very erratic. You would think it would be better with a laser but it's actually worse. I finally had to stop using it completely out of frustration."
4,This is a very good notebook/laptop mouse,Microsoft B5W-00001 Wireless Notebook Laser Mouse 6000This is a very good ergonomic mouse. Don't listen to all the skeptics.
3,Here are the problems,"First off, go for Logitech mice; they are cheaper, have better laser technology and better ""other"" button placementBad things are as follows:The mouse wheel is too small (but does have a nice no-friction scrolling.The side button is horribly placed for me; i have to put my whole hand over the mouse for my thumb to be able to reach it.If you lift your mouse up for any reason, it will take a few moments to come back; in other words, it sleeps really fast.Worst thing are as follows:The mouse has to be within a 1.5 feet from the receiver (for me)Sometimes, the mouse just randomly spazes (?) out; sometimes it just moves a few pixels though i move my mouse a good distance.Overall, it is ok for $20 flat; it is a good notebook size, battery lasts a long time, and its comfortable, but the unresponsiveness kills it."
3,Precision laser but tough on hands,Good mouse for laptops. But a but too small for an average hand like mine. It takes effort to click right-button and feedback from the buttons are not that tactile (great). I recommend Logitech mice for its ergonomics and feedback.
2,I'm Returning to Mine - Gives me Cramps,"If you have mild to severe carpal tunnel syndrome like I do, I would NOT recommend this mouse. It is simply uncomfortable to use. First, it lies too flat to be gripped comfortably. I do NOT have large hands either. In fact, I am a woman with very small hands and I found it simply ""too small and thin"" to be of comfort. Second, I was getting a cramp in my middle right finger from using the scroll wheel. Again, the design is simply not very ergonomic IMHO. I did like having a programmable 4th button (which is why I wanted to upgrade)but that was really the only improvement I saw. For now, I will stick with my Microsoft Optical Mouse 3000 as it simply is A LOT more comfortable to use. It's a shame that the newer model has a poorer design ! I might have to switch to Logitech VX..."
1,Do not buy!,"I agree with most of the posts here that state that the mouse is not ergonomically designed. It's hard to left-click even after I had adjusted the settings.After installing this wireless laser mouse, my screensaver would not work. I have Windows XP Media Center. I searched the microsoft support page and found a temporary fix that I have to do every time I want my screensaver to work. You would think Microsoft would have a permanent fix to this since it's their operating system and mouse. It is just typical of Microsoft.So, I'm returning this product! It was such a waste of time!"
1,Worst range in a wireless mouse ever ...,"This product deserves no stars.With the receiver in the USB port on the left side of my notebook computer, the mouse stops responding if I move it to the right side of the computer. That's less than 16 inches. I am restricted using it in an area in front of the laptop. Pretty dismal. I guess if I were left handed the mouse might be ok. But then the third button is on the wrong side of the mouse.For a right handed person the product might be useable if their laptop had usb ports on the right hand side."
2,Clunky,"I used this mouse for two frustrating weeks. There were 5 main issues:1. ""Clicking"" required very firm, frontward pressure, or you would not get an action.2. When clicking, the pointer has a tendancy to move upward, sometimes sliding off the thing you are clicking on. That means a ""do over"".3. The magnifier side button is fickle. Just pressing it doesn't always activate the magnifier. You have to try various kinds of direct or indirect presses. Same with de-activating it. (A nice magnifier, however).4. Sometimes the mouse stalls or seems to be just at the edge of the operating range, causing you to fiddle with it to get it to go all out.5. Very noisy clicks!All and all, too clunky and imprecise. Try the very smooth, quiet and sure Logitech 7X I just bought as a replacement for the Microsoft Laser 6000. It operates as you expect a good mouse to do."
5,Nice and comfortable for my laptop,I just received it today and immediately plugged it to my laptop. I'm on my bed and I've been working with it for a couple of hours and the mouse feels extremelly well. My hand is big but the mouse fits very well.The installation was very easy although you need to install the IntellPoint software in order to get all the features offered by the mouse. With basic drivers only the wheel and the middle button works. The horizontal and magnifier buttons doesn't work without the drivers.Great product.
3,Laser mouse 6000,It's nice---when it works. Produce is very picky about location. It also eats batteries at a pretty good rate. I'll stick to a $5.00 connected mouse next time. Very expensive.
2,Not as good as its precursor,"I've been using Microsoft Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse for over 1 year and quite satisfy with it, so when this finally hit market, I bought one without hesitation. However, it's rather disappointing.The buttons become rather firm and pretty hard to press now, the mouse itself, has no ergonomic design and hard to hold, I wouldn't be surprised if your wrist/finger hurts after use this mouse.The mouse comes with side button, works as a magnification(driver required), but, the button is poorly designed, after turn on with a single click, several clicks are needed to turn it off.Pros:Laser Technology(no noticeable benifit though)Slim DesignGood built qualityCons:Poor side buttonNo ergonomic designHard to press button(it's a matter of taste, but I don't like it)If you need a good notebook mouse, go for Microsoft Wireless Notebook Optical, it's still the best notebook mouse, I'm still waiting for V400 though."
4,Microsoft B5W-00001 Wireless Notebook Laser Mouse 6000,"The mouse works well; but, I find the ""buttons"" to be quite stiff. there's not much weight to the mouse, so sometimes the force required to press the stiff ""buttons"" will cause me to mouse away form whatever I was attempting to click on...other than that, the mouse is great :)"
2,Barely basic,"I'm a CAD jockey, which in laymen's terms, means I make computer-aided drawings. This was a backup mouse for my laptop, but it's barely adequate. If all you're doing is browsing the web, it's fine, albeit a bit small, and only 1/10th the functionality of my MacBook track pad. However, the scrolling is jumpy, and in AutoCAD, it's completely unusable for panning, zooming, and orbiting. The useless magnifying button isn't programmable, but that's not unusual for MS. I don't recommend this mouse, because you can get a better one for less $ that lacks a useless button. I must say it does feel comfortable, which is about the only thing MS seems capable of doing."
4,Simple.... easy to use...comfortable in hand,Easy to install...easy to use.....comfortable in hand....rate it 88% got it 3 weeks now and still havent had any problems using it..sleek and very comfortable to use....good buy for your money....
4,laser mouse,This is a good product. The magnifier is really cool but I dont really use it since I never needed to magnify anything on my computer screen. The mouse is simple and easy to use. No problems so far.
4,Hey! A mouse is a mouse,"I just needed a new mouse for one that went south. I had another just like it and this one works just as well. Microsoft mice are MUCH more programmable than Logitech. I use them on desktops. Batteries last a long time, and it only takes one AA rather than 2 AAA's like some. It's a good buy."
1,A poor product,"I have been using this product for a week now. I am very unhappy with it. Does not perform even core mouse functions like click, double click. The cursor keeps jumping all over and loses connection with the base very often. Do not recommend."
1,"Microsoft makes software, Logitech makes mice.","This mouse is riddled with problems. The pointer tracks erratically, the scroll wheel has no tactile feel and has a dead spot where it doesn't scroll at all. Batteries last less than a month, as indicated by the software popping up a notification balloon on the Windows taskbar. It frequently looses its wireless connection to the computer.Microsoft used to make a good mouse but this one is junk. I feel like a sucker for buying it. I won't buy anymore hardware from Microsoft.I'd let Microsoft stick to making software and get a Logitech mouse."
1,Microsoft 6000 Wireless,This mouse is just OK. You need VERY small hands to feel comfortable using it. The wireless feature is great.
1,Lifetime expectancy = 1 month,"Pretty horrible.It works for a while, and then buttons start to go bad. And on day, you will find that you can't click on anything, 'cause the button is not operational anymore."
2,Scrolling wheel problem,I purchased the Microsofts wireless 6000 this June 06. I noticed rightaway the scrolling wheel was not rolling smoothly. I ignored it thinkingI was overly sensitive being this was my first wireless mouse. Fast forward 4 months and the rubber grip separated from the wheel making itnearly impossible to use. I haven't notice any other complaints aboutthe rubber grip so this just may be an isolated incident. However themouse is a little on the small size for everyday use especially with pc games.
2,Mouse clicks,This would be a real nice mouse except that the left click button doesn't work smoothly except at the very tip.
4,Great Notebook Mouse,"I love this mouse, just wish it were a tad larger to fit my hand. Precise, works under most surfaces, the receiver design is excelent."
1,This is bad ....,"Bought this a few days ago. First of all, this is very uncomfortable. Their is a ridge down the middle and that bites your palm of the hand. Also, the scroll wheel is so narrow and it also bites your finger.I have had the intellimouse for a while and have always liked. This and the Microsoft Optical mouse 4000 share the same id. I found both very uncomfortable. Dissappointed."
1,Mind of Its Own,"I've read all of the reviews here, and can agree with most of the complaints. My main problem the lack of precision in graphics programs, it's difficult to control. I tried uninstalling Intellipoint and that improved the situation somewhat. The magnifier is indeed almost impossible to turn off. The most frustrating aspect is the vertical scrolling. Even at the slowest setting, images fly by too fast to see (in some graphics programs, ACDSee for example). Other mice have a click/stop with the wheel, this does not, and that may be the real problem."
2,Not Ergonomic,"From reading the other reviews, it appears as though I'm not the only one who is disappointed with the ergonomics of this mouse. While I have had it for a while, this issue became apparent only recently as I've begun to use it several hours a day. I've just placed an order for the old BX3-00008, and believe that it will better suite my needs.Also, I must say that I am forced to use a mouse pad on my desk (a shiny laminate-topped surface), because the mouse does not accurately register my movement without it."
1,Avoid at all costs..,"buttons are too hard to click and clicking the WHEEL is so stiff, it will destroy your finger within minutes. I bought for my laptop, but now I carry a MS intellimouse exporer 3.0 as it is the most functional mouse I have found.do not buy this."
1,packaging not good,This seller sent me a non-working product and when I sent it back he said he didn't receive it. He did not refund my money.Ginny
4,Cool shirt,Runs a little bit large but it looks and feels good. I would recommend this shirt to any Lakers fan.
2,Too many bells and whistles,"This product works fine as far as indoor/outdoor temperatures are concened. What's driving me nuts is the alarm clock feature. I guess they had enough room on the chip to include an alarm - and I don't need an alarm and didn't buy it for the alarm. This is especially true since directions are translated straight from the Chinese to a babble that makes no sense at all. Consequently, the alarm rings at random times day and night and eventually stops without human intervention - only to ring again at random. This wears down the battery, and will result in an early replacement need - unless I throw the thing against the wall first!"
2,Do not buy this model,"Not reccomended. It needs to be completely reprogrammed every few days. Outside sensor only reads part time and needs to be protected by the weather, I did this by putting it in a freezer bag. Customer service did not return my call. The inside temp. reading and the clock feature works great but I bought it for the outside feature and it was disapointing."
1,Disappointed,"This product has proved frustrating and it has been returned. The clock and alarm functions were the problem. Even after reading the instructions multiple times and attempting to properly set the alarm to OFF, it would sound at odd times. Any time there is a malfunction with the outdoor remote sensor it has to be reset, brought inside and ""connected"" to the receiving unit. The 100' range is very ""iffy"" Unless you have line of sight and little in the way of walls, etc. it may not work. I finally concluded it was more grief than I wanted. Oh yes, the clock never did ""self set.""Oregon Scientific RMR383HGA-S Wireless Indoor/Outdoor Thermometer with Self-Setting Atomic Clock, Silver"
2,don't waste your money,I love All Clad cookware and all my pots/pans are All-Clad. But they are clearly taking advantage of their name with these measuring spoons. They are no different than any other stainless steel ones. Only 4 times the price. You are paying for the name ONLY.
5,Great Measuring Spoon,I'm really pleased with these measuring spoons. They are firm and can be dipped into any product without bending or misshaping. They will last a lifetime and I'm glad I have them.
5,Powerful,This book is great because it shows fetal development in each state. Good pictures and very informative. Everyone should take a look.
2,Too technical!,"I was hoping to find a book that would give a detailed explanation of the developing fetus on a day-by-day basis. Unfortunately, the text was exceptionally technical, and the information was not organized in a timeline fashion. Instead, each chapter focused on one particular organ, and discussed its development in boring detail. In addition, the photographs of fetal cadavers were disturbing. This book would most likely be suited for a medical student who is studying the development of human organs. Not a good read for a woman investigating pregnancy!"
4,Exploring Tree Habitats,This book is a good expository book for young children. It has educational illustrations which focuses on various types of trees and their habitats. I used this book with my first grade class to teach about different types of animals that live in trees. My class found both the pictures and information useful when writing in their science journals. I plan on keeping this book in my classroom library since many of my students enjoy reading this book during silent reading.
4,Romanticism from the Low Countries,"So, now you can buy more CD's of Belgian composers than ever before! Try this one if you like unpretentious, romantic music. Benoit must have learnt a lot of Berlioz; Mortelmans has a great touch of his own and De Vocht is a romantic soul, lost in the last century. By the way: Volume 2 is excellent too and in 1991 Marco Polo issued a very fine Volume Zero with some other shorter scores."
1,Very Annoying,"I've owned this for a year and am looking for a new keyboard. I have continual connection problems with mouse and keyboard and continually have to reset. Low battery warnings appear every day. This keyboard was not cheap and I thought Microsoft could do better, but I can't afford to waste my time trying to type a sentence."
4,Good Wireless KB/Mouse,"Seems to have a decent range for this type of wireless connection, great response from the mouse, i have an older version of the this KB/Mouse and it doesnt work from as far away"
1,Do not buy this product!,The keyboard and mouse worked great in regards to accuracy and functions but the receiver is not good for your health. As I was using it I started to feel a tingling sensation over my body. I thought I was imagining things since this was the first wireless set I purchased but I continued to experience the same feelings as I continued to use it. I even started to unplug it from the usb port when not in use. The last time I used it as soon as I pluged it into the usb port sharp pain shot thru the left side of my head. I immediately unplugged the receiver packed everything back into the box took it back to the store and exchanged it for a WIRED keyboard and mouse.I admit it could have been a defective set that I got but I feel safer going with a wired system. I actually got the MS Digital Media Pro Keyboard which has a similar layout to the MS 6000 and a Logitech trackball mouse both work great but I do miss the magnifier on the 6000 mouse.
1,Great Product,"I read the good and bad reviews. With such a wide range of opinions, I thought the product must work from the good reviews written. And if it does work, the bad reviews must be operator error.If it works for some it should work for all. I think I made the right choice. The key board and mouse work great."
2,Bad Keyboard,"Mouse is good, Keyboard is junk, specifically the space bar needs redesigning. There should be a recall on this keyboard. Spacebar gets hit more times than any other key, and it is the weak link in the keyboard design. Like I say the Mouse is great. Spacebar will get locked up on the right or left side after awhile. Don't much like the curved keyboard either."
3,The second keyboard I bought,"This is the second keyboard i bought. It's exactly the same one I bought for my other computer. Both of them are used on iMac computers. While I had absolutely no problems with my first keyboard, I did have some problems with the second one. First of all, when I installed the software, I could not get the CD-ROM out of iMac and the computer become unresponsive completely with the CD-ROm inside. And when I finally got it out thanks to apple service representative's help then i noticed the keyboard skips some letters when typing fast."
3,"Nice keyboard, battery hungry mouse.","Works well, and I like the typing action on the keyboard. I have big hands, if you have small hands you may find them a little widespread.The mouse eats batteries. Do not believe the hype about how long they last."
4,"Good product, with a higher price tag","As ususal, being a Microsoft product the Desktop 6000 is good. Also as usual I find that I am paying a premium for the Microsoft brand. One of my fellow office workers bought a similar product by another company and got essentially the same features for about 15% less.Time will tell if the Microsoft product will outlast the off-brand..."
4,It is indeed spill-resistant!,"This is my 4th keyboard in the past year and a half; between myself and my daughter we've spilled everything from coffee to apple juice on our previous ones. When the apple juice spilled (yet again) on this keyboard, it was really easy to pop off the letters, let them dry, then clean them up without any permanent damage to the keyboard."
1,Buggy,"Installing this keyboard caused my screen saver and power saver features of my monitor to stop working. Apparently this is a known problem. I couldn't find a work around.After about 3 days of use, the keyboard and mouse started flashing wireless connectivity error messages. I replaced the batteries, but that didn't help. The operation became intermittent at that point and I returned it."
1,It's a bad investment,I have to disconect it at least 5 times a day because it suddenly gets stuck in a key stroke and keeps typing it until you disconect it phisically
2,Best point is it's weak point!,Got this package on sale. Installation was easy. Software on CD was outdated but you can go to Microsoft site and download the newest.Keyboard feels great. Mouse on other hand... terrible! I got this because friend had his Logitech wireless keyboard/mouse and I loved his setup. RF receiver have serious problems syncing with the mouse at any range! Pointer jumps around and always doesn't track right.Pro:[] Keyboard feels great.[] Keyboard <==> RF receiver is almost perfect.[] Mouse feels very solid in hand.Con:[] Mouse <==> RF receiver is HORRIBLE!! Spent more time on frustration than actually using the mouse.[] 27Mhz RF instead of 2.4Ghz wireless.
4,Watch out for key reflections,One warning for users with over head lights. The 6000 keyboard that has tranparent (light gray) keys is very hard to read if the lighting is not quite right. I have a light directly above my desk and the reflected glare off the keys makes all the letters and numbers disappear. Go for a black key or similar model.
5,A forgotten Classic,Found this CD in a used CD shop...what a treasure!Used to have the old audio tape in the early '70's while going to university...wow it all comes back. Now I'll let my 19 year old daughter give it a listen. A truly timeless piece of work.
4,Not your typical Bob Dylan Albumn,"The first time I heard this, I screamed, ""What a travesty! She's destroying Bob Dylan's beautiful songs!"" It was not unlike Picasso re-doing Matisses's lovely water paintings in electric blue-and-orange splatter paint.But, I dragged out my copy about a year later and listened to it for itself. She jazzes up Dylan's tunes with drums, electric guitars and electric organs (as was the style back then). Of course no one can do Bob like Bob, but she does Bob like Joan Baez; I'd prefer more acoustic numbers but, what the hell...It's an aquired taste -- not unlike NyQuil. But once you're addicted, it's not so bad."
3,Gloom and Doom,"Although much of the information is now out of date, (published in 1995) the author is trying to emphasize the sad state of retirement planning among baby boomers.-Your 401(k) and stocks are going to be in the dumper-You will get little to no Social Security-You will likely not have nearly enough pension money-You'll probably have to work well past your anticipated ""retirement age""I believe that there will be ups and downs, but to preach this gloom and doom makes for very depressing reading. Those that have not been saving already know they're in for some hard times. Heck, if I were one who hadn't been saving for decades, I'd consider committing hara-kiri with a plastic butter knife after reading this."
5,This product rocks,This product is great. I got it today and i love it. The ESP is the best with it on it is impossible to make it skip. So for those who are looking at this product. It may be inexpensive but you get more than your moneys worth
4,This is great!,"I borrowed this cd player from one of my friends, and I loved it! It never skips, and the only bad thing about it is that it makes batteries die very quickly if you listen to a cd for hours at a time. I'm going to buy this cd player as soon as I can!"
2,This CD player did not work for me,"I had to order this item 2 times. The first time i got it it wouldn't play anything so I sent it back and ordered another one of the same kind.That one was working, until this summer where I would put in a CD and the display would say ""Error"" or --- To fix that sometimes it would work if I pushed the CD down really hard to make sure that it was securely on. But soon that wouldn't and I decided to send it back. If I were you and I was thinking about buying a MEMOREX product, expacially the MD6440CP model I wouldn't. Or maybe I just have bad luck."
3,Copy,"Its a good dvd, but its a copy/burn. I'm ok with that but the company should be upfront with the public about that."
4,Easy to follow instructions,"Excellent book, with easy to follow instructions gives good tips for quick make up techniques. Really teaches you how to look your best and tells you things we should all nowI loved it"
4,Good book to start with,"This is a good book especially for people who want to learn the different makeup types for specific skin types. I expected more in terms of application techniques and shade examples for each of the face that was made up. The book describes the eye color used but (surprisingly) not the shade of foundation, concealer, blush used. It made good recommendations on what color works for each skin type, but it would have been nice to map the shades to each of the faces in the book. It's a good starter book but I wanted more."
3,Basic but provides a good start for beginners.,"This book provides the very basic fundamentals of makeup and makeup application. It provides an overview of the types of foundation, concealer, powder, lipstick, and eyeshadow available today and which is appropriate for your own skin type. I did learn a lot in regards to choosing an appropriate foundation as well as applying concealer more accurately.The author represents various types of women of different ethnic backgrounds, I found this to be most helpful. Moreover, he utilizes predominately ""everyday"" women, this book is not filled with supermodels.Again, this book is very basic, hence if you have a firm understanding of makeup and wish to expand your skill set this is probably not the book for you. On the other hand, if you are like me, overwhelmed by the countless varieties and always making the wrong choice, this book is great start."
3,Truth and Lies with makeovers,This book has a number of great tips for people looking for a makeover. It also has lots of great pictures most of which have been airbrushed to make the models look even better. The tips are sound and good advice but the photos are deceptive. Lots of makeup no makeup looks.
2,??????,I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS BOOK HAS SUCH GOOD REVIEWS! IT HAS NICE PHOTOS BUT NOT VERY MUCH TO LEARN.
5,Shipment took too long,"The product was as advertised as I have purchased six of these books in the past. I did not notice the length of shipment that was allowed with this vendor. I just cannot deal with waiting that long. My bad, buyer beware."
2,OVER RATED,"WOW, Not what i expected. these people reviewing are not the brightest if they call this the bible of make up books. lets start by saying kevin (auocon?) wrote the bible on make up. secondly it is eve pearls that is a close second with the plastic surgery wthout surgery book. this book is ok, but to pick betwen modern books available now, id go with the eve pearl one."
2,"Great Pictures, No How-To's","Wow, Robert Jones is an amazing make-up artists. I only wish he were an equally amazing teacher. This book is long on beautiful pictures, but short on actual how-to's. If you're looking for inspiration, buy this book. If you're looking to replicate the looks yourself, look elsewhere."
4,Back to basics...,"Say, you are novice in the make-up department. I am convinced this book can be a useful reference. It gives detailed explanation on all topics concerning make-up e.g. how many types of eyeshadows are there, which is best for what, how do you apply them...the whole works. This book features very good before-and-after pictures, and addresses the different types of facial attributes so that you can play up your best and play down your worst with make-up. You can probably get a lot of inspirations from them.But say, you wear make-up on a regular basis and have some kind of knowledge on the subject (i.e. you know the difference between an eyebrow pencil and an eye pencil at one glance), this book is *yawn* nothing but a compiled reiteration of what you already know.Overall, I still like this book because I can always refer to it if I ever forget how to open up droopy eyelids using make-up, and I can always pass it to my niece or daughter (if I have one) as my version of an heirloom."
5,Make up is more important than you think,"Most women make the mistake of wearing to much make up or trying to be someone they're not. This book teaches you how to draw out and accentuate your natural features. I appreciate the step by step nature of the instructions, because I know it can be hard to learn motor skill related things from a book."
3,"pretty good, but now...","I feel like I need Robert Jones to evaluate my face shape, eye shape and setting, skin tone, and pick out makeup for me. Then I could really use the book. And some of the photos do look Photoshopped."
3,Why are these photos retouched and manipulated?!,"My pet peeve when looking at makeup books is seeing retouched photos. I want to see real women with flaws and REALISTIC results from makeup techniques. I don't expect makeup to be a miracle cure for all imperfections. The book has some good information, but it is very basic. It wasn't inspiring to me."
2,Not a good book for beginners,"I am starting my professional career in makeup artistry, but this has been a hobby of mine for 20 years. This book does have great information. It has solid foundation/building blocks explaining the different tools & types of makeup. It does not have great instructional steps for a beginner. Get a Kevyn Aucoin book like, ""The Art of Makeup"". There are much better instructional steps in that book. I was planning on getting ""Makeup Makeovers: Weddings"" by the same author and decided to get this one because it's available via Kindle. Huge disappointment. I disagree with the shape assessments and it's too difficult to match a face to his description because it's not on the same page. I will not purchase that book after this huge let down. Once again there is good reference material in here and I'll be able to use a bit of what is offered in this book, however I knew most of the information in this book already."
2,Make Up Book for the Average!,"I Totally Agree with a couple of other reviews that state this book is for the very average and beginners, its not much to learn and not appealing at all, actually almost all the girls looks the same...."
2,Photography book is a better description...,"I must admit I was very excited about this book when I bought it. However, I became dissapointed after 5 minutes of openning it. The pictures are beautiful however, there is not a lot of information about techniques and makeup in general. The makeover examples are not innovative at all."
5,Excellent learning tips,This book is amazing! I love how you can learn so much especially if you want to get into the make up industry. It is a must have! I am so happy I came across this book. I really recommend it!
5,WOW!!!! The best book ever on makeup!!!!,"This is the best book I have ever read on makeup, and I own them all even the vintage Way Bandy books!!!! This is the first book I have ever read that actually teaches you how to apply makeup!! Kevyn's books only show you pretty pictures, Bobbi's and Trish's are trying to sell you makeup!! Makeup Makeovers is actually showing me how to look my best and to love my own features not try to look like someone else!! I have never look so good as I do after using the techniques in this book, and at 40 I can use all the help I can get!!! BUY THIS BOOK (we all need it)!!!!"
3,Airbrushed!,"I was really enjoying this book and agreed with all of the positive reviews, until....I saw how a vast majority of the photos were airbrushed! It is so obvious that it is very unpleasant. These are obviously lovely women, made up wonderfully and then they had to airbrush them? Why? It really spoils the book for me. The book has lots of information in it, but if artificial-looking faces are not for you, don't buy this book. If i had read through all the reviews carefully, I wouldn't have bought it either."
2,Not what I expected,"I was hoping for a book explaining how to apply makeup, showing before and after pictures....While the before and after pics were interesting, it wasn't too helpful beyond that."
4,pretty good fun...big fans may rate it higher,"This is a pretty fun DVD. Big fans may find more to love than myself, being a casual fan of Ace and KISS. It isn't that expensive and for the money you get a nearly half hour sort of biography piece that is fun and interesting with a bit of history and a bit of good tech talk about guitars and amps etc. Ace also teaches a couple of tunes Cold Gin and Shock Me. The bonus performances and solos and promo for his latest album are nice extras but hardly revelatory. Its well produced for the most part and there are other musicians on the project to add their 2 cents like Matt Sorum and George Lynch that don't add that much in my opinion. Ace really looks shot to heck and ready to join ANVIL but he seems in good spirits and comes across and a sort of cool dude."
4,Ace Frehley on Lead Guitar.,"Ace is an icon. Watching him describe how to play ""Cold Gin"" and ""Shock Me"" is awesome. Ace presents these songs but what comes across the most is his love for crunchy guitar and that you have to go for ""feel"". Stop worrying about open chords, barre chords, power chords, etc and just go for the tone you hear in your head.Ace Rocks!"
3,Not what I expected,Overall the dvd was ok. Who doesn't like Ace. But basically you are paying to learn to play Cold Gin and Shock me from Ace. I expected a better interview and more and different live footage than what was in the decription of the dvd. Other than that enjoy.
3,good to see ace sober,"I enjoyed it, and he was good at teaching the two songs. The sunglasses really need to go. Im sure he is weathered around the eyes, but who cares. Hes Ace, the rock god. I saw him in a bar, in eugene oregon, and he was very drunk. Its great to see him clean these days. For an Ace fan, you should get this. Its fun and dosent cost alot"
2,Very deceptive,"I had been looking for a way to increase the resale value of my home when I saw this item. Despite its advertising though, it is not a tree. I learned this lesson after I hired a contractor to cut through the concrete slab in my hallway and spent money on a very expensive indoor irrigation system. It has not grown an inch since planting, and the base seems to be rotting from all the watering. That may be due to the cheap fiberboard this seems to be made of. Maybe the description is one of those wacky translation errors; it is manufactured in Taiwan. Based on my experience with the product, I now understand why Jimmy Carter voided the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty. I still don't understand what he meant when he said he had ""lust in his heart""."
2,Excellent service but unsatisfied with earrings,"Received earrings very quickly in lovely box w/ribbon. However, the earrings themselves are tiny and the stones aren't pretty -- they're milky/cloudy. And although the design looks great online, I did not like it in person -- the top two connected parts are very stiff and then the bottom two connected parts dangle freely."
4,Good sparkle in candlelight,"By daylight these earrings are a little less sparkling in reality than they appear in the picture, but they make up for that during a candlelight dinner. I personally like understated, good quality jewelry that requires a good look, so I am happy, but if you like eyecatching bling this one is not your thing. Katarina in my experience is a very reliable seller."
2,Storybook Classics: Peter Pan,"This DVD was purchased,along with Alice In Wonderland for my 4 year old grandaughter--BOTH were BORING and hard to understand with English accent! She didn't like it--Waste of $$$$ I wil NEVER buy Storybook Classics again!! I will stick to DISNEY!"
1,not even worth 1 star!,"this is horrrrrible! my daughter LOVES anything to do with Peter Pan and Captain Hook (she's 2) but this couldn't even keep her attention for a moment, much less mine. I always liked the movie (the original that is) but this is soo incredibly slow that it won't keep any child entertained for any period of time. it's just very dull and (unless you've just never seen the original) the artwork is a bit poor. Sorry, if you do like it."
1,Don't buy this DVD!!!! Money Thrown Away,"Everything on this DVD is totally FAKE. My favorite is the graphically inserted, slowly moving sailboat in the background of an ocean view. At least it got me laughing for a moment. Then I threw it in a garbage. That's that."
2,Not so cool,"I DID NOT LIKE THS TOY VERY MUCH.THE FIGURE IS COOL,BUT I DID NOT LIKE THE FACT THAT HIS LIGHTSAER IS ATTACHEDTO HIS HAND.SO BASIKLY,THIS FIGURE IS NOT SO COOL"
4,"Pretty cool toy, but way to small!","When I first got this in the mail i was really happy but i was really surprised how small it was , don't get me wrong it's a awsome toy but keep it away from little brothers, little sisters etc.."
1,Cheap Toys,"For almost 28 years now I have loved Star Wars, and I could not wait for the third and final movie because my oldest son would be the same age I was when I first saw Star Wars. Well... lets just say that Lucas is off to another bad start with this final movie. My son has most of the new figures, and all of them are falling apart after less then two weeks. C-3PO broke the first day out off the box, along with Yoda. My son and I are very disappointed by these toys, and are planning on saving our money and not giving any more to a greedy old man that is steeling from his fans by making half baked toys and movies. DO NOT BY THESE TOYS!!!!"
5,Pick two is # 1,Great game for people who love crossword puzzles and even for those who don't really like word games. Easy to play and learn. Addictive for when you want to make really creative words!
5,So Fun!,"Great game if you like words and spelling and liveliness! Good for multiple people or even a slower paced two person game. My husband and I change it to ""pick 4"" so it works with just two people."
5,A watch for every one,"This watch is certainly for every one, it has the month, date and day of the week that other wtches usually do not have.It also has a chronometer and a count down timer, also not available on most digitals. It also has multiple time screen to be able to tract times at differing time zone in addition to an alarm. It also, has a great nite lite system.Last but not least the face of the watch can be cleared of all digital information if so desired, with the pressing of one button. I picked the white screen."
4,A nice looking semi-disposable watch,"I've been using this watch for about a week. And I have come to some conclusions. As a side note, I have used a timex for a couple of years until it broke. It was a great watch and I liked it.Pros:- It is pretty nice looking.- It has dual displays with big digital letters.- It is relatively comfortable, unless you have thin wrists.- It has lots functions and it is easy to use.Cons:- The accuracy! I am very disappointed that it is far from accurate. In one week the analog dial is 4 secs faster and the digital display 3 seconds faster.- The bands are, as others have said, weak. They are thin and with designed grooves that will break in the future. And they don't seem to be user replaceable.Conclusion:For the price, it is a pretty watch. It is very functional and overall I like it. My only really gripe is the accuracy."
2,Planned Obsolescence,"A good multi-function watch, but the watch-band is integral to the body of the watch and does not look like it can be replaced. A decent watch will last forever (and I expect no different from this one), but I've never had a watch-band last longer than a year, and I'm not interested in having to carry it in my pocket after it tears. The band even has ready made tear lines on the inside. JUNK."
2,"Short-lived, unreparable band on a very nice watch","The watch is both nice-looking and very functional. I woudl give it 5 stars if not for the band. The band and the watch are one resin piece, hence once the band tears, it is unreparable. I liked this watch so much I tries to repair the band but it kept breaking in different locations."
3,You cannot replace the watchband!,"I almost bought this watch until I closely examined the picture and got curious about how the watchband attached to the timepiece. I contacted Timex about it and they said it cannot be replaced by the customer. If the band breaks you have to send it back to Timex with $10 to get a new band put on. You also have to pay for shipping. If you don't like the band or have problems with the rubber affecting your skin, too bad. Not a wise purchase IMHO. This issue applies to many other Ironman, Sport I and Sport II type Timex watches to look closely before buying."
3,The band is key,Looks great and just what I want out of a watch. However the band is key. If it breaks then we have issues.
4,Nice Value,"For the price, this is a very nice digital watch. It's easy enough to use, even without the directions, and it has all of the standard features a digital watch should have; namingly that it's waterproof for the average person (it's fine if you swim or take showers with it) it can carry two times (analog and digital) which makes it ideal if you often travel to different time zones, it has an alarm, a lap timer, carries the date and day, and the digital interface can be 'hidden' so that it can double as a professional looking watch, save the rubber band. It's comfortable and light. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a simple digital watch. Timex does a good job. The Indiglo lighting is also good."
2,Band Breaks Easily,"I have had this watch for over a year or so, and it was exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately, the band broke pretty easily. I, too, did not put it through anything incredibly rough. It was just everyday wear and tear. Needless to say, I'm pretty disappointed in the quality of this watch."
2,Watch is great but useless without a band,"I cannot complain about the watch itself - but like others in this review section, my band is now broken (in a little more than a year) and my $75 watch is useless to me. The band cannot be replaced, its part of the watch itself. I will double check this on every new watch I buy. This is the first time a TIMEX watch has let me down - and it wasn't really the watch itself. Poor planning at TIMEX."
1,Disappointment,"I thought this book was going to be a mystery. The first chapter starts out well with some very nice prose. But it didn't take long for me to wonder what was going on. I found myself confused when the main character is changing her name every few paragraphs and her thoughts wander aimlessly on the page. I basically forced myself to continue, only to abandon the book at the halfway point. Save yourself some time and skip this read."
4,The Xmas Voice,"Yes, Joan Baez is a great singer of Christmas songs too. And why not? Even if your not a fan of all of her work, there's no doubt she has the voice of an angel! And this is the perfect album on which to hear that voice as it was recorded in 1966, when Joan's voice was at it's loveliest. If your looking for a simple Christmas album, not overproduced, featuring your favorite carols sung in a passionate, powerful manner this one is for you.Especially beautiful are Joan's versions of ""I Wonder as I Wander"", ""What Child is This"", and an incredible, ""Silent Night.""This will quickly become one of your favorite Christmas Albums."
5,"Joan Baez' ""Noel""","What makes this collection of Christmas music special is the unique quality of the singer's voice. It has the purity of a classical artist's. But many recordings by classical artists leave the words almost inaudible, since musical tone is emphasized at the expense of clear diction. As a folksinger, Joan follows in that tradition of articulating the words clearly, even when she sings in German and French, which she does in two of the carols. So she produces an almost perfect blend of musicality and vocalization--very satisfying and easy to listen to.One other feature stands out--where the songs are devotional, Joan sings them with a wonderful depth of sincerity. A good example is her rendering of Schubert's ""Ave Maria."" This is a prayer, after all--and Joan's version is almost hypnotic in its meditative intensity. It is hard for me to imagine another artist producing a more satisfying version of the song.All in all, a very recommendable album."
2,poor quality recording,"I am a Baez fan with many CD's and records - Noel is the poorest quality recording of them all. Similar to Hi-Fi before ""stereo"". Save your money for almost anything else that will probably be great."
1,By What Example?,"Buyer beware: if you're just learning Java, skip this book entirely! After about 140 pages or so - probably sooner - you'll be left wondering just what you're learning (if anything), put the book down, and you won't pick it back up again. Start with either the O'Neil book ""Teach Yourself Java"" or an even better one: ""Java: How to Program - 3rd Edition"" by Deitel & Deitel. Sorry I wasted my money on this one. Don't you make the same mistake."
3,opportunity squandered,"beatiful title: very utilitarian. We all know we learn best from examples. But there is a missed opportunity here. For example, while the title implies we are talking Java 2 speak, it mentions nothing of the collection framework but rather uses the legacy classes Vector and Hashtable. I did enjoy the string manipulation chapter and the file stream chapter. Still looking for a java version of a beautiful book created 8 years ago, ""Postcript by Example"". Note that Java Examples in a Nutshell doesn't have that many examples using the collection framework found in java.util package."
3,Solid book,"Solidly written book, but what I find annoying is that you have to download the source code for the examples off the website (not printed in the book, nor is a disk given). Apart from that I would've liked a section on network programming (sockets etc). Otherwise, it's an adequate introduction to Java."
1,Worthless,"Allow me to be blunt: This book is a complete waste of money. Unless you already have some OO experience, this book is essentially useless. Examples are very hard to come by. The best you can hope for is a massive segment of code, followed by line by line explanations of what is going on. This is a very ineffective way in which to learn a new language. Also, concepts are not presented in a concise manner (unlike every other programming book I have used), but instead spread over the course of many pages, buried within tons of superfluous material. This is very frustrating when you are attempting to use this text as a reference, and I cannot begin to imagine how annoying it must be if you are a beginner!!!(...)"
2,Lacking depth and simplicity,"After purchasing a copy of this book, I regret having spent my money on it, when there are many good books out there. If you are not an experienced programmer or do not have any background on C/C++ , you should look for another good book that will teach you the ins and outs of Java programming, I recommend ""Teach yourself Java in 24 hours"" and ""Java how to program by Deitel"" , having read this two books and found them rich in information and important pointers to program in Java. I already can do some programming , thanks to these two books. I am speaking on behalf of many novice Java programmers out there, being one of them. But don't take my word for it, go ahead and gamble in buying this friesen book, after all , it's your money."
5,"So many motifs, I don't know where to use them all!","My husband and I are trying to start a t-shirt company and this book gave us some great ideas. So many, that I don't know how we are going to produce that many shirts. I would really recommend this book for ideas for all kinds of crafts."
2,Way too small,"The other reviewers weren't kidding about this vest being very small. I am a 5'3' female that only weighs 120 pounds, so when I heard that this vest was too small for most, I figured it would fit me pretty well as most things are too big for me. However, this vest was very tight and rubbed up against my chin even though I am so small. I ended up returning it and ordering a different vest because even though I could get it on and fasten it, I would have been very uncomfortable wearing it."
3,A Medium Sized Life Jacket,"This is a fairly well-made life jacket, but it is too dinky for someone my size. I am over six feet tall and weigh over 220 lbs and even though I can strap this thing on, it looks and feels like it is made for much smaller people. It is not really big enough for my wife either, and she about 5'7"" and of medium-heavy build. It should be bigger for her to wear it comfortably. So I would recommend a larger vest for anyone that is anywhere near six foot tall. From the experience I have had in buying through Amazon, I am sure I could send them back for a return. But I am going to keep the two I bought as extras for smaller people to use, because the price is right and I don't want to go to the trouble of returning them."
4,x20 Life vest,I found this vest to be a nice purchase. It fits well and is easy to put on and off.It is made to the necessary regulation approval guidlines and is labeled as such.I find that the blue is okay to spot in the water but i recommend a bright color if you want the person wearing it to be easily spotted.
4,Great life jacket for the price,"It's everything I needed in a life jacket, at a very affordable price. Not the most comfortable thing, but life jackets rarely are. I bought one for me and one for my girlfriend. My girlfriend says it is a bit tight in the chestal region and you can't adjust the tightness of that top strap, I guess for safety reasons. So maybe these are better for guys than for moderate- to large-chested girls. Overall, though, I am pleased with my purchase. 4 stars."
2,You get what you pay for when it comes to ski vests.,"Only used by children for less than two months and the flotation foam inside the vest is in several sheets, rather then the more expensive neoprene vests that have a one piece foam inside that cost more but lasts a lot longer. the sheets of foam roll over inside the vest and then make the vest un wearable."
2,Way too small for an adult male who wears a Large shirt,I am 5ft 8in wear a size large t-shirtthis item should be listed as adult small not universal adultit would save on ordering the wrong size realistically this might be a good fit for a small teen in jr high and then some 12-13 year olds might be a tight fit. perhaps the vendor should list chest and height recommendations
3,Good for the Kids,"These vests are good for the kids; the price is right, and the colors exciting. But they are supposedly adult universal. I'm 6' 1"" and 250 pounds. I couldn't even begin to get the straps to reach around me."
5,X20 Universal Adult Life Jacket Vest - Blue & Black,"I love this, it came soooo fast and it works great, I use it for kayaking and it also fits great and looks great too. My girlfriend thinks its funny, but I think its great hahaha!Jason HarshbergerHarrisburg, PA"
3,MN fun,We bought a red and a blue. The jackets are very nice looking but for adults they're to short. The price was great but I guess you get what you pay.
3,Fit funny on a girl,"while it will fit anyone really, it does not wrap around the waste and feels/fits weird. It is bulky up front, especially if your chest is large."
4,Adult life vest,This vest suites my needs but you may find it cheaper elsewhere because the tag on this vest stated the price as $15.00 while Amazon is selling it for $17.95.
4,Good Buy,"Very snug fit, I had to loosen all the straps (I'm about 220 lbs). You can't beat this price for a stand-by life jacket. I bought it to meet boat safety regs. I'm pretty sure I'll jump in the drink with it on to see how well she floats."
2,deceiving product name,Supposed to be universal adult size...what I got was universal child size. Was counting on it for our rafting trip. Was very disappointed.
3,Little snug in the chest,"Nice looking vest, just snug in the upper chest part, maybe fitted for a male more then being a universal size."
3,Adequate,"For the price, this is a pretty good, standby, life jacket. However, if you are kayaking, or sitting, you may find it is a bit long and you lap will force it to ride up into your chin. My wife, who is shorter, can't really wear it properly. Definitely a men's, adult life jacket."
4,Great for the money,I doubt that it would ever be necessary to use this item so I didn't want to spend a lot. The quality however is much better than expected.
4,good fit,"This vest fits tightly enough to the neck to feel secure, but not choking. The belt system gives plenty of girth where its needed."
2,Great for...choking.,"I got the product on time. I loved the look and took it out on my kayak, not wearing it but had it under my feet. When we went out to the beach on day, I wanted something to use to float with. I put it on and it felt ok, it was very short on my back and front, not an adult Jacket. Too bad, but it does fit (I thought). When I got in the water, and the vest raised up on my body onto my chin and neck! I got a bad burn (rash type) from it on my neck and chest. I am very disappointed."
2,The neck is too small for comfort,"I bought two of these vests for a new two-person kayak. I was able to adjust the straps to fit reasonably well, but the opening for the neck felt quite uncomfortable. I can't imagine trying to wear it while paddling for more than ten minutes. Too bad, because the price was right.Incidentally, one reviewer noted that the top strap doesn't adjust. That is true, but it doesn't need to adjust because that strap does not go all the way around the vest. It is only meant to insure that the two halves of the front stay tight against each other. The lower two straps can adjust as needed to separate the front of the vest from the back of the vest as much as necessary. So it would have fit if only I could have breathed in it!"
3,sufficient fora variety of different guest sizes,"If I'd realized this was exactly the same as the plain blue multisized life jacket that was a little less, I would have purchased 2 of them instead. The versatility of being multisizeable also produces a great excess of strap when it is being used by a smaller person. I think I would have preferred a jacket with less versatility."
2,Way too Small,"Nice life jacket that I bought for myslf and ended up giving to my wife. It runs very very small. I am 6'-0"" tall and about 205lbs. The jacket would latch (barely) but the back of the jacket and bottom strap was a few inches lower than my pecks and made the back of the jacket sit uncormfortably high. Fits my 5'-0"" 100 lb wife perfectly and would probably fit a thin teenager ok."
4,My new pocket pal,"Small, great for the price, if you want a good low end price one where you get what you paid for, slips right down deep into my pocket, buy it!"
1,Don't waste your money!,The musical pull string doesn't pull down. Not worth paying more shipping charges to send back. I threw it away!
1,lasted less than one hour,"A nice treat for my dog!, it took him five minutes to chew it apart, get rid of it and jump over the fence to enjoy his freedom. I was expecting something of some quality... disappointed. Money wasted!"
2,No Jump Harness,Not sure if it works or not because it's just too complicated to get it on my dog. Very flimsy and I just didn't have the patience to proceed. Total waste of $$ for me and I have 2 dogs.
1,Product,"This is a worthless prodcut, the reviews are all correct. It does not stay buckeled DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!"
2,"Great idea, Terrible design","As many of the other reviewers have stated, this contraption is not chew proof and if your dog has any inclination to chew on things this will last less than an hour. It's a hot mess trying to get this thing on too as we all run out of patience--especially my Australian Sheppard--he's already chewing it while I'm putting it on, then he gets tired of the whole affair and just flops over on his back and refuses to move.In a perfect doggy world this would be made of more substantial material with thicker, wider straps. Also, I would put small metal rivet holes every half inch covering the entire thing. Not sharp studs or something that would hurt the dog of course--but enough to deter the dog from chewing on it. Also, the design needs to be tweaked a bit to make it easier to put the darn thing on the dog. Just thinking out loud here.At any rate, I'd pay a lot more for a version that would last."
2,Jumping Harness,"We bought this product for our 6 month old dachshund-mix puppy. First of all, my experience is probably greatly a problem with a very bouncy dog rather than the product itself. But it was extremely hard to get on the dog. Then with one good shake, it was hanging around his neck, and we had to start over again. but I think it might work if we could get it tight enough. The back middle strap hits the dog at a very uncomfortable place. We will keep trying a few more times. But all in all, it hasn't worked."
1,Don't bother,"It was hard to put this on even with decent directions. There are too many loose ends and buckles. As soon as my basset hound tried to jump it started slipping and getting loose around her legs. Since everything is adjustable, on some dogs there are going to be really long leftover ends for them to trip on and get irritated with. I just felt horrible for my dog. I wish I had not bought it."
1,This didn't work for my dog.,"My dog immediately jumped the fence even with the harness on. Maybe I put it on wrong, but I couldn't get it to work."
1,No Jump Harness,Horrible product. Near impossible to put on and it slips out of place constantly. Did not work at all for my Whippits.
1,it sucks,its confusing to get on and just a hastle. i havent figured out how to get it on her yet...
1,Don't waste your money or your time.,"After over an hour of first figuring how to out the darned thing on, and getting my jumping dog to stand still long enough for me to get it on her, one of the buckles came loose and the entire harness just fell off in the yard. Even if I was ableto find the buckle, which I wasn't, not sure if I would have been able to determine how to replace the buckle and then get the harness back on. Awful. Awful. Awful."
1,Don't waste your money!,"We received this no jump harness as a gift for our jumping Springer. He had it chewed off in less than 5 minutes. I would love to get my money back, but this was a gift and we have no idea where it was purchased."
1,waist of money,we bought this product. when we tried putting it on our dog. it was the most difficult contraption ever and didnt have good instructions at all. the straps dont even stay tight. i would never recommend buying this product.
1,Sux,"Besides the lotion I bought to encourage hair growth , this is the biggest waste of money I've had in recent memory .i would send it back and not even expect a refund if my boxer hadn't chewed in two immediately after I put it on her . Not a bargain at any price . $17.00 shipping .wow"
1,Classic Products No Jump Harness,"This will most likely be going back. I thought I was pretty smart but after spending 30 minutes trying to figure out how this fit on the dog with no avail, I gave up and will be returning it. Upset because I think the concept works, if it was just easier to put on the dog...."
1,Doesn't work!,"I ignored the bad reviews of this product, and bought it anyways! Big mistake! The reviews are right! This product is a huge pain to even attempt to get on our dog (border collie- 40 pounds) and once we finally did..the harness didn't keep her from jumping even a little bit! Don't waste your money!"
2,"Good idea, but needs some work","The idea of this item is great. And to some extent it works. The only problem is the straps don't stay taught in the buckles, so you have to tie knots in them to keep the straps from pulling fully out of the buckles. We still use it on our dog, and she doesn't seem to mind it too much, but it gets all out-of-whack very quickly because of the belt problem."
2,anti jumping harness,put this collar on and ater about 30 seconds my dog was over the fence and gone.He left the collar somewhere in the woods but he did come ack.Was had to fix and when I did get it on correctly it did not work for him
2,USER FRIENDLY? NOT,"Although the harness does what it is supposed to, it is so hard to get on I never use it."
2,Think before you buy,"Although this product proved itself to be a smart investment, it was hell getting it on my dog.I own a Pitbull and by the time I was done, I had a headache and I was covered in fur.If your dog does not keep still do not buy this item, it is challenging to put it on!!"
1,Save your money,"There has got to be something else you can purchase for the $11 or $12 this product costs. Very cheaply made product, straps do NOT stay in the plastic buckles. Instructions were not bad, the quality of the materials was so bad, that the entire harness was invalidated. Straps do not stay on. I have a 45 lbs mix (lab, hound) and straps fell off everytime she walked around. My dog was still climbing over the fence, now my only option is an electric fence.Amazon was really good about me returning the product, that was my best experience."
3,Really complicated...,"This is a great idea, but it is so hard to get on! My dog is very active, and getting her to keep still long enough to attach that many straps, much less adjust them, is nearly impossible!"
3,too large for dachshunds,a good product that will work on larger dogs. it does not work on small dogs such as a dachshund who likes to jump. need a product specifically for small dogs that is lighter and made for the smaller size- not one that supposedly adjusts to be small.
2,It needs to be chew proof,"I purchased this for my son's dog, who loves to jump. It would stop the jumping, but the dog chewed through the thing in 30 minutes, and it's ruined. And figuring out how to put it on the dog IS rocket science, especially if you are spacially chalenged, as my family assures me that I am. It would be great if the dog didn't destroy it in short order."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"I have a weimaraner who is almost two, and this harness did not fit her. It was way too big and wouldn't stay on her. It definitely does not fit her the way the picture shows. It was a total waste of money!"
4,Good value,"Gives me the info I need. Sure it's not 100% accurate, but I'm sure if it was it would cost more."
3,"Very nice weather station, but not fully satisfied","The Weather Station fulfills all the technical stuff it promises.The only concern I have is that I had to manually set the clock and it CAN NOT BE WALL MOUNTED - which iritates me alot, as it is never mentioned in the product description."
4,as advertized,"I bought this to learn interior (temp and moisture) and exterior (2o') readings, and for that it does a good job. Recommend for those purposes."
5,This book has wonderful photos on Filipino architecture.,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Filipino architecture or Asian architecture in general. The photos are wonderful! I lived in the Philippines for 14 years and this book definitely took me to a trip down memory lane. Dive into this book and you can almost feel the warm breezes and sunshine of the Philippines. I only wish that they had included more photos of the Filipino Nipa Hut. But other than that, this book is fabulous! I've recommended this to a lot of my friends. Some of my favorite photos include the Tagaytay Highlands Club House and photos of the older ""bahay na bato"" (houses of stone) that are slowly disappearing from the Philippine landscape. I hope this book encourages the preservation of these Filipino architectural treasures."
5,BEAUTIFUL,"This book was given to me as a birthday gift from my mother-in-law. I absolutely love this book. There are many beautiful photos. There are places and subjects that I never knew had so much beauty. Because I am already a huge fan of art and architecture, it was fun to learn about the many influences to Filipino style. I liked it so much that I had to buy a copy for my father (Born in Las Pinas - Metro Manila, Philippines)"
1,Condescending,"Like his other book, the appallingly titled ""Toddler Taming"" Dr Green advises parents in the most condescending way how to ""train"" their child from an early age. He seems intent on forcing babies to behave in a way that is most ""convenient"" and ignores their basic instinctive needs.More like an instruction manual than a parenting book."
1,What a WASTE of Money,"I bought this for my daughter who is 3 1/2. The toy does not even work, even if you follow the directions. Save your money, DON'T BUT IT."
1,Don't waste your money on this toy!!,"This is honestly the worst toy that I have ever purchased. It is almost impossible to get it to work. My 5 year old son became completely frustrated with it, as did I. Unless the conditions under which it is being used are just right, it does not work at all. The bath water has to be very hot and the child needs to hold the board under water to be able to write on it, which is very difficult to do. I am sorry that I wasted my money on this thing!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"The other reviews were right on.. don't waste your money on this toy that doesn't work! I found that the screen will change colors while underwater, but immediately upon hitting any air, it will change the color that the pen generates, thus completely ruining the picture. I bought it for Christmas last year, have not used it more than twice, and it will make an appearance at next summer's yard sale!I did really like the AquaDoodle coloring mats which are great.. they have an Elmo design or Thomas the Train.. and they allow kids to color over and over without making a mess!"
1,Piece of Junk,The toy doesn't work...even a little. I wonder how a company can market a toy that they obviously didn't even try themselves first. I can't stand being ripped off like this.
1,"really, really bad",this toy is really bad. it doesn't stay warm enough to draw a picture. could not once dublicate to results that are on the box. not even for a second. Whats most embarrassing is that I gave this as gifts to three kids and now I feel like I should appologise for such a terrible gift. do not buy this product unless you want to be highly disappointed.
3,The Seduction Cookbook: Culinary Creations For Lovers,"The ritual of cooking and dining have not been explored enough in our American culture in terms of romance. This book is about preparing sensual dishes (tastes and presentations) with the right atmosphere (candles, soft music, flowers, beautiful settings). All the recipes are simple and are clearly displayed on only one page thus freeing the cook to spend less time in the kitchen and more time at the table with a loved one."
2,USED not NEW,The cover was old and I was told it was NEW.. pictures look better online than in the book but they have good recepies
5,"A Must Own For the Wed, the Single, & the Dating!","Where to begin about how amazing this books is?! Firstly, I am no gourmet- and I have dazzled them all when I have cooked with this book- probably because of how much fun it is- yes, it's sexy, smart, etc. but Diane makes cooking fun. How cliche! But too true. This is the perfect little gift for a bride to be...your friend's house warming...hey, help spice up a marriage and give it for a 25th anniversairy! Ladies, also a nice hint for your man for Valetine's Day...leave the book lying around, and one night you may come home to a nice suprise!! Good Luck!!"
3,Beautiful Journal with the Ugliest Uncovered Open Spine,"I truly love the Paperblanks line of journals, and this one arrived with a beautiful cover, great paper, you can open the book so it's completely flat, but when I saw what I can only describe as a ""missing spine"" - I almost returned it.The spine is ""open"" ""uncovered"" and you see the paper with the stitching -it looks horrible, and I would *not* display this in a bookcase spine facing out.I was very surprised because nowhere in the book description does it indicate that in essence the spine is missing.If you lay it flat on a table, it looks good. Would I buy this particular journal again? No, but I would buy the other ones Paperblanks sells that I gave 5 star reviews. This one was just too much of a disappointment."
4,Nice old-school feel,"I was pretty happy with the overall quality of the book. The cover is nice, and has a pocket in the back for personal items such as photos or letters. The pages are quality, and the binding give an old-school feel to the book. The only thing that some people may find as a negative is that there is only stitching for a binding...there is no cover present at the fold, so you can see the pages. Some may not like that style, but it does give off a very old feel to the book."
4,Anything but A Cliche.,"After being a huge Big Star fan during college in the 70's, I followed Alex Chilton's career and music over the next three decades from a distance. Over the last few years, I have taken more interest in Chilton's solo career and found a similar passion and quality to a lot of his solo recordings. I feel that ""Cliches"" is a must for Chilton fans with this album highlighting his smooth, honest vocals and excellent guitar playing. Track 8 ""Frame for the Blues"" is a wonderful acoustic rendition of a great Slide Hampton tune, and Track 10 ""There Will Never Be Another You"" also stands out. This album is totally different from the power pop music of Big Star, but Chilton's vocals and guitar playing make these songs anything but ""Cliches""."
3,not that great,"The photo looks great. Misleading, tho...Twelve ounces is totally wrong. Isn't 12 oz the size of a can of coke? If it fits six oz, I'd be surprised. They are smaller than they appear from the photographs, and since the volume is so misleading, I thought they would be larger glasses. Wrong!One glass out of the twelve (three boxes of four) I ordered on special was chipped. Another broke in the dishwasher. They are quite fragile.The good points, not very heavy for glassware. They do sparkle. I like the square bottom to round top design."
3,Not Exactly What I Expected,"I purchased this air filter, for my Craftsman lawn mower, at a reasonable price.However, what I received does not match the filter that I had, nor the filter in the photo, which is deceiving.The filter that I received does not have the wire mesh around the outside of the paper cylinder. Instead, it is only the paper.The filter does fit my mower, it is just missing the wire mesh.Now, I don't know if this is the cause, but since changing to this new filter, the mower is blowing out blue smoke when I first start it, after it has been sitting for a while. It did not used to do that."
2,Very misleading,This ring is not as big in person and the design that goes around the ring does not match up at the seams. It is actually crooked. Don't waste your money on this one.
5,The title says it all.,Every home should have this CD. And the man is more remarkable than the music. It is essential.
2,"This is an ""Essential""?","As much as I love Doc Watson, I fail to understand nor to appreciate this album. How can a Doc Watson Essential album exist without ""Tennessee Stud""? Go figure!"
1,Fantastic,"I think that this CD by far is one of if not the best. One other thing, if there is anybody out there that is a big Doc Watson fan, years ago he had a guitar course out, does anybody know how I could get one or even if it still exist? Thank You for taking the time to read this."
5,Splendid!,"This product is just splendid! It has everything I need to know in these books. It has sections about study skills, physics, science, animals, history, plants, chemistry, math, government, society, people, countries, world. It even has a section on French and Spanish that helps you learn a little bit about the language, and thus I can speak small phrases in Spanish and in French.This is a great reference because if you need any help or something this is a great book to refer to. It has almost everything you need. I fell in love with this book the first thing it arrive. You won't be disappointed and I highly recommend this to ANYONE.This book is made for grades 1st to college, so this book is for your WHOLE life time!!I am glad I bought this :)"
5,Excellent fantasy epic,"This book kept me gripped all the way through, with a brilliant plot and identifiable characters. The author creates an awesome atmosphere with heaps of great description and imagery and plenty of plot twists.I don't normally read fantasy books at all, but this book has introduced me perfectly to the genre, and i look forward to reading more books by this author."
4,More like a horror than fantasy,pretty fast paced and good read but some images are very disturbing and horror like. May give a few nightmares.
3,"Pretty good, but not really for adults","The only problem with the book is that it is written at what I would consider the 7th to 9th grade level. It is a fantasy. You do not get tired or hungry. You heal quickly if hurt. There are armys of demons you can slay by waving your flashlight at them. I did not find anything stupid or in any way offensive but I was hoping for something with a little more zap - a touch of ""Perdido Street Station"" or ""The Black Company"", perhaps. If you are in the 8th grade and looking for a fantasy, this may be your book."
1,Not LG VX3200,"This item does not fit the LG VX3200 phone. It only fits LG VX6000 or4500 or LX5450 or 5550. It says so on the package, and the connections do not match."
3,Great prose not much plot.,"While it is true that the prose and descriptions in this novel are compelling, the plot lacks a driving force. This book takes you inside a series of events, describes them beautifully, but does not take you on the a journey which reaches a true end or conclusion. I waited for everything to come together, but the novel simply concluded without resolution."
1,Head-acre,"I'm forced to agree with the negative reviews on this page. The prose is horribly overwrought (The Sins of the Fathers! Ooga-booga-booga!) and dull. Nathan's downfall is never interesting, never achieves the level of real tragedy because we're never convinced he had the possibility of being a better person; so he played jazz saxophone once upon a time, so what? His character is really unappealing and self-pitying, the womanizing almost a Mel Brooks joke. The character of the murdered half-sister, Isabel, with whom he was involved is inexcusably thin...This book practically herniates itself trying to be Under the Volcano and is not even close. I got a headache from Blood Acre."
5,"""Very Intriguing New Book!""",A fresh new look at Joseph. There are so many great teaching points in the book that I would like to keep a copy on hand for my own use. An exciting and practicial book!
5,"""Your understanding of doctrine is refreshing...I'm giving copies to my children!""",I'm a veteran teacher--21 years. I'm enjoying your book on Joseph. I was a teaching leader in Bible Study Fellowship for 7 years. Your understanding of doctrine is refreshing in a post modern culture. Thanks for spending the time to write the book. I'm giving copies to my children for Christmas.
2,Cheap fabric,"Fabric rough, and poorly made, buttons fell off pillows, don't recommend this item, the skirt is really flimsy and cheaply made no liner, would not order again"
1,Scamming.,"These people claim in their product features that it includes a daybed which they did not send. I contacted the Georgia location and they said that they only ship the blankets from there, and to contact their California location to see where the bed is. Whenever I called them the California location claimed to have sent the blanket, and that the ordered contained no bed. These people are cheats just trying to take your money. The product described as being $400 marked down to $78 whenever I bought it, the blanket they sent was poorly made. There is no way that this product was originally $400 just for some cheap blanket."
5,YESSSSS!,"Star Wars Episode 3 is here! I have been waiting for this day! The new action figures are highly detailed,super articulated,and completly fun.Have fun!"
1,"I don't like action ""Features""","I don't like the ""Action features"" they put in these new figures they are better then Episode II's Figures but they are still weak. I'm not picky about this I just would like one Obi or Anakin that doesn't have these features."
5,Great Honky Tonk Ragtime,"Fantastic, over-the-top honky tonk sound applied to ragtime and some others. Two of these tracks, Ragtime Cowboy Joe and Stars & Stripes, were played by Jean Shepherd on his radio show, so that brings back fond memories too. Great record."
4,Conan unseated from his throne,"A prosperous Aquilonia flourishes under Conan's firm rule, but Conan is deposed by an evil plot that originates with his neighbors in Nemedia. Black arts are engaged to defeat the great barbarian, but Conan makes a journey to find a way to save Aquilonia from usurpation.L. Sprague de Camp does an admirable job as editor. The Conan books are not precisely my cuppa tea, but are an essential read for people interested in the history of the fantasy genre."
4,responsibility,This movie was very good. It shows a young teen man taking responsibility for his actions. This Lifetime movie realy captured the true story of a teen father.
2,just ok,"I'm not quite impressed but at least I didn't put out a lot of money. I don't think it seems sturdy enough or spins fast enough. I'm willing to have a small doubt because I haven't tried each different paper and I've not used anything like this before, so maybe I could use it more effectivly?. So far a plain pumice stone seems like it would do the same."
3,Ok for the money,"As stated by others, this needs more sandpaper refills. The other two seem useless to me. Mine came missing a piece, the one that attaches the head securely to the body.Overall, it does a good job, but it stops if you put too much pressure. I'm sure I could find something better in the future?"
3,Great product for the value,Definitely one of the more effective pedicure tools I've owned although still takes a little more time than I'd like to remove the dead skin and smooth. Would be great if the tool has a little more power.
4,Good Choice,"At the beginning it was difficult to learn how to control this apparatus. If you put a lot of pressure it stops. Sometimes the heads go off. The batteries don't fit easily. However, I like it a lot: it really makes your feet smooth; the replacements are ""everlasting""; it doesn't consume lots of energy; I have dropped it several times and it's still in one piece, working properly. A similar gadget will cost 10 to 20 times more in stores.I definitely recommend it!"
4,better than others,"I had gotten this products as a gift about 10yrs ago.When it finally gave out, I search and seach and it wasno longer in the market.Then I had order something else from you and I reviewedyou foot products and .........hurray!!!! it was back.I ordered it for my daughter-in-law and she loved it.Then I ordered for myself.It is better than the others I had bought after thefirst gave out."
1,"piece of junk, save your money","It worked really well for about a dozen times. Then the motor stopped rotating. Though there's a year warranty, it was so cheap, it hardly seems worth the cost of shipping it back. I guess you get what you pay for..."
1,What a joke!!!!,I can't believe this product is for real and that people gave this high ratings. It is a cheap piece of garbage and does absolutely nothing!!do not waste your money!!!
5,Pedicure Set,I am extremely happy I bought this item. Everyone could use soft feet for the summer. The price was very affordable for what this little machine can do! I recommend buying it because it is affordable!!
3,The tool is good but refill is quite pricy!,"The only attach I use is ""sand"" which does a good job. The only concern I have is that the refills of sand are quite expensive. You have 3 refills coming with this purchase. But I accidently dropped one in the toilet and the one attached on the tool was flying out one day after I used it maybe 3 times. So I only have 1 refill left. I looked at the price--$6 for 3 refills purchasing from the factory! Well, if 3 refills cost $6, this tool is quite cheap. Anyway, I guess I will go with the original hand tool after my refill is used up. Also, the best time this tool works is right after you semi-dry your feet from soaking in the warm water for about 5 min."
1,Don't bother,"I have been using various types of things to help me avoid having calloused heels for 10-15 years. I was excited when I saw this product and bought one for myself and for my sister. What a disappointment! It just doesn't work well. There isn't enough ""power"" in the spinning for it to really have an effect on serious callouses. If you have some dry skin, it might work okay for that. But anyone with serious callous problems needs to look elsewhere. This isn't your answer."
4,A tribute to enduring love,"This is a story of life, love, and survival.It's presented in the first person which makes it personal and interesting... following someone's life and thoughts, Christa invites us in to her heart. She shares emotions and mind connections that join us all as we go through lives unexpected heartaches and staggering moments of sorrow.It's a love story that goes beyond fictional fairytales and enriches to a higher level of real undying spirit and love.A beautiful, yet heartbreaking story. It touches the very deepest of humankind."
4,Great addition to small laundry spaces,"This just barely fits in my laundry closet, but it helps tremendously when I have a lot of items that need to air dry. Just what I was looking for."
2,Does NOT work with Creative ZEN,Does NOT work with Creative ZEN. Neither does the Ming Ling one I tried. Later found out it DOES work fine with a Sansa MP3 player I purchased.
3,Tries too hard to be too many things,"Based on the jacket cover, I thought the book would be some sort of light English romance. It was. But it was also science fiction/fantasy, historical fiction and a spy thriller. What!?!? Yes, there were some weird jolts between ""oh, let's not get into another war"" -- ""Drop another crystal and magick them"" -- ""He drove wildly, trying to escape his pursuer..."" that seemed to me like a schizophrenic wrote the book. It was, however, entertaining and the last few chapters sort of put things into place."
3,Only used a few times,"Not quite what I had hoped, but we will use until gone to see if consistence use will help. thanx"
2,OK up to a point,"Worked fine with an electric shaver and with a curling iron, but with a hair dryer the fan motor just growled and turned slowly. The prongs on the base unit wouldn't reach into a grounded 220V receptacle (which is recessed). It could be made to work by plugging the converter into one of the (included) adapter plugs, but it needed to be plugged in only part way, since the prongs on the converter are metal only at the tips. This required some careful one-handed juggling while shaving with the other hand."
5,Battery switch,I ordered a pair of 6010 m-Series (Mini) Battery Switch Dual Circuit for my boat. It was the wrong size. I contacted the seller and had an immediate response to return it.
4,No subtitles or closed caption,"I am a big fan of Dr. Quinn and when it aired on TV it had closed caption. I do not hear well so when the set arrived and does not have closed caption or subtitles I was very disappointed. I have to turn the volumn up full blast and then I still don't understand most of what is said. I would like to find this product that has closed caption or subtitles so I can enjoy it and ""hear"" it."
4,International Customers,"I've just received the megaset. I would like to share a few things which could be of interest:- For international customers: Though the megaset doesn't come with any dubbing or subtitles whatsoever, I am thrilled by the fact that it is NOT limited to the American region code 1. It will play on pretty much all DVD players worldwide. Thank you, A&E; Home Video! If you order, please be aware that you might have to pay extra V.A.T. (MwSt.) and/or customs fees (They charged me an extra of approx. 30.-$).- Any customers: If you order because of the ""faux-leather"" look etc., please don't. The packaging is functional and looks nice enough, but I wouldn't want to put it on display. If you buy for the content, you'll be very happy with the megaset. I think it's a great price for what you get, and they did a very beautiful job in designing the DVD menues.I am looking forward to many happy hours!"
5,Great Price,I really enjoy these movies. I have friends who dont like them but I think they are very entertaining. I do like movies set in the past and i enjoy seeing how life was like.
4,Enjoying again.,"I started watching the series on cable and decided to watch from beginning to end in order. DVD arrived fast. One of the spindles is broken, but not a big deal. Box still closes. Wholesome series even if not historically correct. Good characterizations and would prefer my grand kids watch this over a lot of other programs."
4,"Great seriers, not so great DVD set",Loved the series but the DVD set came and 3 of the dvd holders were broken and I had some trouble with 2 dvds. Part way through they seemed to skip and/or pause. I have not had this issue with any other dvd's so it is not the player.
5,Dr. Quinn complete set with movies,I love this item! Just as described. The tie on the sturdy box is strong and so is the box. I read reviews that said the string was not good and the box was flimsy. NOT SO!! The box is strong cardboard and looks very nice on display. Even the dvd's are well protected inside their folder. Very happy with this purchase and the price! Even had the movies!
1,Disappointment,"My husband and I are avid series watches but have never received anything like the shocking quality of this set of dvd's, Quality Control is non existant. 80% could not be viewed in any way. A&E have no idea how disappointing this can be for a customer. We have our money back but give me Dr Quinn any day. We would never trust the real source of these dvd's again."
4,Some shows can't be shown,"OK, I bought this new from Amazon, the whole series, and I found that certain years don't play, they freeze up......three series of the 6 had episodes that froze, and I couldn't finish watching the episode, quite disappointing.......otherwise not bad...just be forewarned that not all discs will work accordingly. would almost have to think that I was shipped used series, instead of purchased new. this should not have happened...."
3,I love the show but am disappointed with Amazon.,"I still can't find anywhere that says that the complete series includes the two movies, which would normally would be a good thing but Amazon suggested I also buy the movies. So I ended up with two of each movie and in returning the extra one I had to pay half of the cost of the movie just to ship it back. Also the case for the set was damaged in more then one place. Never had a problem with Amazon before but I'm quite unhappy with this purchase."
4,Fun Memories,"I grew up watching this show with my family, but it's hard to find on television now. Buying and watching this brought back so many memories, and also some laughs. While some of the characters are a little quirky, it's some good, clean entertainment for young families to watch. PS, Joe Lando is HOT!"
4,Dr Quinn Medicine Women,This product arrived on time and was well worth the money. Enjoyed many hours of family entertainment
2,nostalgia,"It gives me a picture of the past, simple, but harsh living conditions It also relates how the natives , their food sources and freedom were almost destroyed all in the name of progress,greed etc.The nature of man hasen't changed all that much"
5,OUTSTANDING,I received the complete Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman series as a Christmas gift. I love it. I have watched around 7 episodes so far. I use to watch it when it was on and really liked it but now I love it even more. It is a family show with no curse words and teaches family christian values. All the characters are just wonderful. My two favorites are Michaela and Sully. It is a joy to sit back and watch their romance slowly develop. That a big difference from how the so called modern day romances on TV are portrayed today. Dr. Quinn and Sully's is so much more romantic and exciting. I would recommend this series to anyone who loves westerns
4,Great series but...,"This is an excellent series, but be aware that these DVDs do NOT have closed captioning or subtitles. Also, the packaging is flimsy. The studio definitely skimped on this set."
4,Doesn't like blu-ray players?,"This series does not play properly on our Blu-Ray player , the first time I've ever had a problem with my blu-ray. It starts fine but either locks up on the selection page or sometimes starts but the picture is garbled/broken up like its being filtered for some reason. However it plays fine for my wife in the bedroom on the HD DVD player so I'm only marking it down to 4 stars. Not sure if this defect is the norm or just on this one set. Otherwise it works fine and is a nice addition to our collection."
5,A series everyone should watch!,"Jane Seymour is outstanding and very beautiful, If only Doctors realy cared about their patients the way Dr. Mike does it would be such a wonderful world. There are many things to marvel about in this series besides the great acting: the great horseback riding abilities of the entire cast, Jane Seymour on a trapeze, the beautiful scenery, The jump off the cliff (not sure if Jane actually did this). The 42 DVD's in this set are a bargain price at less than $2.00 per DVD, that's over 100 hours to spend with Jane and she's worth every penny!"
5,Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman DVD series,Received on time and in the condition advertised. Was pleased with the service and would deal with again. Thanks
5,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome :)",i'm so excited I finally decided to purchase the complete series! I have to many great memories watching this with my family when I was a kid...It is great to watch it again and in order :)
1,Audio Out of Sync,The Audio is out of sync in almost every single episode after the first disc. Completely unwatchable. Ridiculous to spend money on that kind of things. Wheres the quality control!?
1,poor quality,As soon as I opened the case it just fell apart. Now I have a bunch of great DVD'S just laying around without a case. At least they play good.
1,"Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman: The Complete Serier","I loved the show but when I ordered Dr Quinn Medicine Woman, The complete Series item it skipped and or stopped so much I returned it and asked for a replacement.I got a new order and it did the same thing so I returned it for a refund.I was so disappointed in the quality of the taping. I purchased this product at a discount so maybe that is why I got such poor quality. What a shame too..."
3,Not Very Good Quality,"I love the series itself, no question about that. But every single episode at one point during it the voices and the picture are a second or so off. Sometimes, 2 seconds off. Which can be very distracting, and disappointing."
4,Great series; only one problem.,"This was and is a favorite of mine. I have watched the complete series once since buying it, and am now watching it again. The writing and acting are superb, and it is unfortunate that this wonderful show was cancelled because the demographic was women over 40. Dumb move. Quality is quality, and I'd rather watch a carefully and lovingly produced series like this instead of the ""reality programming"" that is so pervasive these days.The first movie is not up to the quality of the series. The second movie, however, is very well done, despite the absence of Chad Allen. I have read that the entire cast is willing to do another movie, 12 years after the second.Now the problem. I suffer from a hearing loss, and there is no closed-captioning available on this set, or any other ""Dr. Quinn"" home video package.That said, I'm glad I bought this set, and will continue to treasure and enjoy it."
2,This is a great series but there was something wrong with the production of the DVDs I received.,"The series is great, Amazon is great, the price was great; however, be forewarned: the production of these DVDs from A&E; was very bad. Several of the DVDs in each season had a glitch, i.e., the sound/dialogue didn't match up with the actors' speech/movements. It was out of sync. We sent it back for a replacement which Amazon was great about, and the same thing happened again but just to the first season of DVDs, so it's hit or miss. It's a shame because this was a gift for Christmas. By the way, there is nothing wrong with my DVD player. These were the only DVDS that this has ever happened to out of all the movies we own.I'm really disappointed that A&E; didn't have quality control on these."
5,Wonderful series!,"I am very pleased I bought this entire series and the price was absolutely fantastic! So I got Christmas money and I bought this right away. I am very pleased I did too I am loving watching all the episodes again plus I had missed the last 2 seasons when it originally aired because I had my own stuff going on at the time. I did purchase the first two seasons, but decided to sell them off and now I have all the seasons together and the movies too! I am happy with this and I know it will be a series I will watch over and over."
1,Major sound problems,I just received this for Christmas and was so excited to reconnect with Dr. Quinn. I loved this show when it was on and I started watching right away. Unfortunately the sound was completely out of sync. I jumped around to many episodes and they were all out of sync. I will be sending this back and hope that the new set doesn't have these problems so I can enjoy the show!!!!Anyone else had these problems?
5,Dr. Quinn,"For any of the Dr. Quinn series lovers, this is a must buy. Good quality production and good series. About the only drawback to the DVD is after each program, you must return to the main menu for the next show."
4,Dr Quinn,This is a christmas gift for my grandaughter. She isenjoying it very much and it made a easy gift forme. It was also half the price than other stores Ichecked in.
5,Great product Great price,"I ordered the Dr. Quinn series because of the extremely good price. I had been looking for it in stores and was finding it difficult to find. It arrived exactly 5 days after I ordered it and though I haven't gotten a chance to watch any of the DVD's yet, outwardly it arrived in perfect condition. I am looking forward to many hours of enjoyment and thank Amazon for offering it at under $50."
5,Love it! The best family series ever!,"I love this Christian series for the moral they portray. It is a program that the whole family can watch and have fun with. I teaches good moral and daily life lessons that we all can learn from. It is clean; it doesn't have Hollywood dirty words or dirty pictures in it! It's clean, fun, and entertaining! We need more television programs like this that do not cause harm to our minds!"
5,Absolutely wonderful!!!!,I loved this show as a child and now to have every show to watch over and over is wonderful and I get to share my memories from watching it with my mother and grandmother with my children.
4,Great Buy!,"I loved this tv show as a kid and was excited to start watching them again. These seasons were great! The extra features could use a little work, but if you like the show it's a great buy! Much cheaper than I saw the entire seasons in stores."
5,Great deal on a wonderful classic television series,"Love the series! I purchased this set a while ago, and I still haven't finished it! To me, the series is so riveting and sucks you in for the 40 minutes or so each episode lasts. This set has everything including the movies!"
1,not worth it,"I am so disappointed there are no subtitles, no extra languages. At this price you would think they would put it in the description. Useless to me, they talk soft and music is too high."
2,Missing Third Year,"I received the ""complete"" set for Christmas and was watching it in order. To my dismay, there were TWO sets of Year TWO and NONE of Year THREE. What a disappointment! Because I've opened years One and Two (1 of them), I cannot return the entire set. VERY disappointed to discover that I can find NO CONTACT info to be able to ask for an exchange of one set of disks for the other... Venting, here, doesn't get me Year Three, I know but it will serve to warn others."
5,"R.Quinn, Complete series + 2 movies","I bought these dvds being aware they could not be working in the European system. On the contrary I can perfectly watch them, both on the dvd reader, which is set only for zone 2, and on the pc.As I read in some reviews I confirm the two movies are included. The oversea shipping was also very quick!"
3,Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman Series,"I purchased this product in lieu of keeping all of the video tapes I had (for space reasons). It comes in a compact case which I like. However, it is difficult sometimes to access the DVD I want with so many of them crammed into a small space. Also, the front and back of the case are glued on and one side was coming off and I had to glue it back on again. After reading other people's reviews before purchasing the product, I was wary of the sound quality. I have had some problems after only watching the first 3 DVD's with them skipping or not starting up correctly. After ejecting the DVD and re-starting it, the problem seems to go away. I really wish they had close captioning on these DVD's though."
5,The best one!,"I've received the book yesterday. It is not the first related to Fountain Pens that I see, but this one is really nice. It is not written as the others but as a review of the history and the kind of pens. I've read almost a half of it last night!"
5,Something Different & Exciting,"Since this book is about my fathers life, I am a bit partial. The story is a fast paced story about the life of a con man with a big heart. He experienced life as a electronic genius and lived in a time of mobsters and prohibition. His many escapades are both interesting and funny. My father is now 91 and lives in a nursing home. He still has ice blue eyes and is smart as a whip. I recommend this book for those who are too young to have known those days, and for others who would like a trip down memory lane."
5,funny,"I mean really, it's Laverne and Shirley! The product is packaged well and the format of the dvds is good."
4,That darn editing!,"Here's another major edit in the new DVD collection (which we waited 3 1/2 years for, by the way!). In the clipfest episode ""Birthday Show"" the thirty minutes we see was probably edited by half, probably originally a one hour special (it originally aired on the weekend before the regular Tuesday airing in the '70s). If you watch the end credits, you see the names of characters highlighted whom we never see on the half-hour DVD. Why ANY editing needed to be done to these old programs is beyond me, and really quite annoying."
5,Fun fifties!,It's a fun trip back into the fifties with the craziness of Laverne and shirley. One of my favorites!
5,Excellent!!!,not too much to say other than I'm waiting with baited breath for year 3 to be released...
4,Penny and Cindy start fresh,"Despite the real-life rivalry between Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams,they start freshly with the second season of Laverne & Shirley in the fall of 1976(the Happy Days spinoff premiered the preceding January). Laverne DeFazio(Marshall) and Shirley Feeney(Williams) are still best friends and roommates living in a Milwaukee apartment and capping bottles at Shotz Brewery. Still dropping into the girls' apartment frequently are Lenny(Eddie Mekka) and Squiggy(David L. Lander). There's also the landlady Edna Babish(Betty Garrett,late of All In The Family) and Laverne's father(Ed Marinaro) who are now a couple."
5,A Wonderful Resource for Parents,This detailed book provides answers to parents' most pressing questions about CAH. The tables and graphs are very helpful. It is well written and easy to understand... a must have for every family affected by CAH.
4,informative,"As a parent of a child with CAH, I found this book to be very informative and easy to understand."
5,C.A.H. information for parents,Very good book written in layman's terms. We have a child with this in our family and this book made me much more comfortable with her condition. I am confident now that she will be fine.
1,Doesn't Work,I used this for almost a month and felt very werid the whole time I was taking it. I had bad with drawl's after I stoped the product and found that I actually gained weight instead of losing weight.this is a really bad product.
1,Not Worth The Money,"I bought this product hoping to lose maybe 15-20 pounds. They ask you tot ake it 3 times a day, with 2 pills. If you skip a does, you feel dizzy & have a big headache. I was on it for a bottlesworth and saw nothing. I exercised regularly and even ate healthier. But still no change. It does suppress your appetite for a while, but once I got off, I suffered from extreme headaches and sleepiness. Save your money. try something else."
3,Does what it's supposed to do,"I actually like this product. I have tried many products in my quest to lose weight. The first week I lost 3 pounds by combining it with diet and exercise. Never felt jittery, never had heart palpitations (Xantrex). Overall I like this product, just hate that the pills are a little too big for me."
2,Not so great,"This product is not better than any other product. However, its no worse either I suppose. Good Luck if you order it."
3,Recommended Dosage???,"I am not sure how anyone can take the recommended dosage. I started out my first day by just taking one pill at a time so I could see how it was going to affect my body. Boy oh boy, I am glad that I did. It really puts my body in overdrive. I don't get any jitters, but I am really fidgety. I can't sit still at all for 3-4 hours after taking ONE pill. I don't have any extra caffeine in my daily diet, so it is all coming from the one pill. The plus side is that is does help me get through my day. I have plenty of energy to workout and keep up with my 4yr old twins. It does seem to help keep the cravings away too...that is always a plus! I just started taking these 3 days ago, so I can't tell yet if they are helping with any weight loss. I will probably continue to take my ONE pill a day to see the 7 days through so I can weigh myself. If the results that I want are there, then I will still take the pills...but only ONE a day!!! I could NEVER take 2 pills, 3 times a day."
2,Not Ephedra,"I recently purchased what I believed to be Metabolife Ultra with Ephedra, only to find out that was not the case. I would recommend that the supplers do not mention that the Metabolife Pills advertised on this site contains Ephedra. They are all Ephedra Free. I had taken Metabolife with Ephedra in the past, & I do remember the tablets having a very dark color, these are very light in color, diffinately, not the Real Deal!"
1,"Worked at first, but then...","I really liked this product at first. Lost five lbs in about 8 days. Side effects weren't noticeable at all and my appetite was suppressed. Than depression set in. I would start crying at work for no reason and I couldn't even explain why. The only thing different in my routine were these pills. I do not know what it does to the chemicals in your brain, but it obviously isn't good.Also, this product is not metabolife. The company that produces this purchased the rights from metabolife when they had to pull the 356 product with ephedra. They bought the rights for all the non-ephedra products, but who really knows what they are doing."
2,Not like the real thing,"Although I've never been more overweight than 10-15 lbs, I used to take Metabolife 356 (with ephedra) from time to time and it worked well. I definitely had more energy and could get away with eating whatever. I originally bought the Ultra by mistake (not knowing about ephedra ban yet) and am about thru with the 90 caplet bottle.... yet no results. No energy increase, no lost lbs/inches. The only benefit that may be present is somewhat lack of appetite. I wouldn't recommend this product... and personally won't be buying it again. (no ephedra - no fat burn)"
1,Didn't Work,This did absolutely nothing. Didn't give me energy or suppress my appetite. Waste of money.
3,book ok,I wished the making was better and the book itself did not look so cheap they are nice stories and I would be willing to pay a little more for a nice presented book
5,Shock Ending,I love a movie with a shock ending.This is one of them.I will not spoil the fun.I enjoy this movie and found it very enjoyable.We all have different taste.
5,Excellent resource for natural birth,"My friend passed this book on to me after her first birth, which she was able to do all natural, telling me that it had been very helpful to her. I have read it cover to cover, and it is great! It has suggestions for herbal and homeopathic remedies for labor, birth and postpartum, which are hard to find elsewhere. Read this book if you paln on having a drug-free birth. It is a quick and easy read."
5,"MUST SEE, MUST BUY",I was already a fan of Sanz before I bought this DVD but after seeing it I had to let everyone know what an incredible performer and consumate artist he is . The musicians including his singers are first rate and the music will literally have you humming for days after.
5,Best performance of his career,What more can I say...Alejandro is absolutely perfect in this concert..i have almost all his dvds and definitely this is the best performance of his career...it's a must-have for fans...
3,"Hints good for beginners, maps and lists good for experts.","Pay heed to the earlier reviewers when they say the hints in this guide are often poorly considered. When they say that an NPC, spell, or item is useless, take it with a hefty grain of salt. In fact, the more vehemently they trash something, the more you should suspect that they are completely wrong. there are also mistakes and omissions. I know far more about BG2 than the authors of this book ever will. That said, I use this book frequently when I play BG2 because of the maps and list of item locations. I do not recommend using it this way as a beginner, but if you've played through the game more than 3 times and you want to know more about it, this is a good way to start. Internet newsgroup archives and web walkthroughs are usually far more thorough sources of information, however."
1,Worst strategy guide I've ever read!,"I just started reading this guide and I was amazed that a book with this many errors was printed. In the walkthrough sections, the same text is printed, word for word, in multiple sections! The first time I thought somebody goofed but when in happened again I thought this is just crappy proof reading/editing. I'm only on page 40 so I don't know how bad the rest of the book is but I do know that pages 26-31 are all messed up. For $14.99, you'd think they could at least have someone proof read these things before they go to the printer."
4,Fun little book!,"The book is only $6.00 and it describes a non-euclidean geometry - it's hard to go wrong! This is really more of a workshop book - the math that's in it is pretty darn simple, yet, it encourages a certain mathematical exploration. So, if you're getting burned out on Calculus and the other heavy stuff, pick this gem up (Did I mention it's only $6.00?) and do what the original mathematicians did: Play with math.My only problem with the book, is that some of the chapters could use some more detail - on the other hand, it does encourage the reader to think a bit more deeply about what's being presented."
1,This is a book for a math student only.,"I thought that this book would be about geometry of exotic (but real) places in outer space (such as a black hole, for example). Instead, it turned out to be a lethally boring book, full of math problems, that was LESS interesting than my geometry book in high school!"
1,"IF YOUR A SKYNYRD FAN, YOU HAVE THIS!","Even though this DVD is not yet released, I've seen a Track Listing, and it's EXACTLY the same as the ""Old Grey Whistle Test"" footage that is already on the bonus DVD with the DELUXE EDITION ofGimme Back My Bullets (W/Dvd) (Dlx). If you have it, save your money, if not, buy it instead and get the CD with Bonus Tracks, a nice booklet and nice packaging! It is at this date also less than $15......UPDATE: Customers who have purchased this report that it IS the exact same concert as on SKYNYRD'SGimme Back My Bullets (W/Dvd) (Dlx), but with terrible quality compared with the official release. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!"
5,Great Archival Live Footage!,"I received this DVD today and it contains excellent live footage from what I consider to be the best Skynyrd era. The video quality is very good (remember this was shot in 1975). All in all, this is a rare concert and nice to finally have on DVD."
3,"Decent, not complete nor deep","Like many books which seek to demystify, or simply simplify, midwifery skills, knowledge and attributes, this is a mixed bag. This approach might be more effective for those who have little comfort in formal education; if you want a rigorous text, consider Mayes, Miles, Varney's, Frye's, or a few others. The information it provides is accepted by many as accurate, although a number of midwives take exception to some things. It is not comprehensive, nor does it provide skills and knowledge for nuanced decision-making. Good uses for this are as a starter or a chatty supplement to an intellectually rigorous program. The author has read some texts on adult learning theory; her application of those theories is a bit heavy-handed."
4,"Fun, funny, fantasy",This was an entertaining story about a woman exploring her sexuality with a man who wanted to explore her. There's light BDSM and a healthy funny sex life between two adults who sizzle. I enjoyed the friendships that Jane and Ian each had with their respective friends. They will make a good book two. I loved how the author did not let Jane freak out when she learned what Ian learned about her. This is a good read for someone looking a love story sprinkled with a little erotica.
5,Can't wait to read more,"This is the first book I have read from hannah Murray and I am definitely going to go order her other two books as soon as possible.I read this book in one sitting and, in my opinion, this is how ""erotica"" or D/s books should be. The lead characters are just two everyday people getting their needs met in a healthy, kinky way. No one is damaged, 'borderline pyschotic', a member of an 'elite ops organization' or kidnapped/raped. And that is just fine with me!I have only recently ventured into ""erotic"" books and I was very disappointed with the first author that I read but luckily, I stumbled upon Ms. Murray and Ellora's Cave books and will definitely read more.Great job!"
4,sneaky fun,"This book is a fun read. I really fell for the characters and wanted my own personal Ian to come visit. I think that the author (Hannah Murray) was really into letting her reader's know that sex can be fun and creative and comfortable. The scenes are wonderful and you can't help get into the minds and hearts of her characters. I had a fabulous time reading this book and it wasn't over the top, you know? Some s/m books just are too much. This was just right (think 3 lil' Bears).ENJOY."
5,A High Rate Of Interest And More,"Tax lien certificates pay safe returns at a high rate of interest every time. In addition, there can be a bonus at the end of the certifcate period. If the lien is not paid off with interest and fees the government taxing authority will sell the lien to you and you can become the owner of the property by paying off the taxes due. That could be a windfall return to you many times over your investment. Don't pay for a $2000 seminar. Just buy a couple of good books on this subject. The expensive seminars on this subject are greatly overpriced."
3,"Informative, but too short!","What there is in this book is useful, but Mr. Loftis uses up too many pages with photos of all the liens and deeds he has bought. A lot of the advice is common sense--know what you are bidding on in a tax deed auction, for example. The information about individual states is perfunctory and at least for Missouri, excluded much information (such as: Saint Louis city conducts its own tax sales, separate from the county, and it sells tax deeds. St. Louis County also appears to sell both tax liens and deeds.).Overall, a useful book, but really only about 40 useful pages."
5,Tax lien book,"Great product! Recommended seller! A++++++very good book! Full of excellent information. Awesome for those who are interested in investing, but don't know what to invest in."
4,RE Tax Liens,Good basic information for those you want to learn about real estate tax liens. The book is broad so a good protion of the information may not be appliciable to your state.
4,Impressions and comments,"This is an excellent, well written book; full of examples of real transactions completed by the author. Very helpful advice and tips given in every chapter.I recommend this book to anyone looking for great advice and guidance on how to start investing in this field."
4,good information,"Whether or not it would be a good deal, depends on how much you pay for it. But I think the information inside is essential if you know nothing, and I think after reading this book, I am in much better shape to formulate meaningful questions about my specific geographical area. There is much to be known, to avoid wasting time or money, Loftice helped."
4,Pip pi What-ho DM!,"Again another excellent collection of DM capers, but again I was confused by the absence of 'Who Stole The Bagpipes?' from the tape I recieved. Who stole the episode? This stopped this tape from getting a full 5 stars in my view. THERE SHOULD BE MORE OF THESE TAPES!"
4,Thermostat fits and works OK.,"I installed this thermostat on a 500w Fahrenheat baseboard heater in a bathroom. It fits right on the end of the heater in place of the end cap. Makes heater installation a breeze. Looks and works great. Cons: No light indicator for heater on, and a bit pricey for my budget."
4,Recommend,"I recommend this product. We ordered it to go with the QMark HBB1254 baseboard heater. They work well together. The thermostat connects to the side of the unit, so it does not increase the length or size which I liked."
2,Difficult to follow,"The author seems to jump between first and third person and makes following the story line difficult. The underline subject line is good, but the deployment is poor."
1,Stolen,These old copies of Kizuna by BeBeautiful were published without the consent of Kazuma Kodaka. The newest publications by June are now coming to us and I urge everyone to buy them instead. I just bought the new publication of volume one from June and I am very happy with it. Please support Kodaka and buy the ones from June instead of BeBeautiful.
2,ordinary,"I awarded two stars because one can read this yaoi without yawning too much and because some plot ideas are excellent... as for the rest...I am no expert, but I found the art quite bad: some strips are grotesque, some sequences confused. There is the usual anime censorship of genitalia: act strips are therefore unclear to say the least.The characters are not particularly likeable, nor deep and they act irreasonably. There are some stereotype hints of humour, completely out of place in what is supposed to be a drama set in the world of yakuza.Last but not least, plenty of the usual unbelievable blond Japanese and the obnoxious obsession for roles in homosexual sex.I will not buy the following volumes."
5,Excellent Explanation of Bond Graphs,"Definitely the best book on Bond Graphs that I have used. Straightforward, not too long, doesnt over-complicate things.I have read most of it cover to cover."
5,A necessary tool,"I have used this book extensively for several years, and it is the best reference book I have. I work with multi-domain systems and this book is perfect."
4,"Transaction handled well, but flaw in merchandise","The timely shipping and handling was commendable, and email provided for tracking. There was provision for return in case of defect.I bought this bag because I was tired of mesh bags which entangled me and my laundry. When using them, I was reminded of Roman gladiatorial combats using nets.The denim bag is of good quality and performs as expected. Unfortunately, I can't give it a fifth star, because there was one spot along the side where a seam was split. For an item of this price, it didn't seem worthwhile to ship it back and await another, so I just patched it up with duct tape. That sufficed."
5,Great beats and yinz can dance to it,I love that someone took an older Roxette song and breathed new life into by giving it a spanking dance beat!! It kinda reminded me of when the old Bryan Adams song got a second life when it became a dance song again years after its initial release. DHT did an awesome/excellent job with this!!!!
1,DHT can't make up their minds.,"DHT doesn't know if they want to cate to the AC crowd that embraced the unplugged version of ""Listen To Your Heart"" or the dance crowd who embraced the trance version. So yuo are left with an album that is half dance half ballads. The ballads are boring and the dance songs sound horribly dated so you really are just left with crap."
4,"Those people who did that ""Roxette"" song","Chances are you know D.H.T. as ""those people who re-did that Roxette song"". That's certainly the way I was introduced to this Belgian duo of Edmée Daenen and Flor Theeuwes, and I instantly loved their cover of ""Listen to Your Heart"".This upbeat Euro-dance pop team comes to us compliments of Robbins Entertainment, the people who brought us D.J. Sammy, with his hot version of Bryan Adams ""Heaven"".Unfortunately, the album doesn't have more tracks like the infectious lead off single, and although their ballads are quite good, I was looking for more dance and trance tracks.Other good tracks are ""I Miss You"" (trance); ""At Seventeen"" (pop); and ""Someone"" (ballad).A nice mix of pop, trance and ballads, and certainly a good choice for fans of Euro music.Amanda Richards, November 11, 2005"
3,Not quite what I expected,"I bought this CD thinking it would be mostly dance music, like their single ""Listen to Your Heart"". After listening to all the songs, I was kind of disappointed. There are a few dance songs, but most of it is a little slower. The music is still great, but don't buy it expecting to have upbeat tempo trance/dance type music."
3,DHT,"DHT's ""Listen to Your Heart"" is an uneven cd throughout. I purchased it hoping that it would be upbeat, energetic, dance-able Euro-dance. And to some degree, it is. The title track is very popular and for good reason.However, there's quite a bit of slower ballad-style songs. Now this would be perfectly fine if it were a Dido album. But I purchased this hoping for something to drive fast to.That said, there are a few good upbeat Euro-dance songs. However they are sometimes followed immediately by a slow song, which creates a very uneven flow to the music.Overall, DHT is just ok. It's not something I would listen to over and over again."
1,Disappointing,"""Listen To Your Heart (Edmee's Unplugged Vocal Edit)"" is the only good song on this album, and it's a real treat. Just download it on iTunes, because it's a great song."
2,Just pick up Roxette and skip this,"I like the song ""Listen to Your Heart"" and find it to be one of the best ballads from the late 80's. However, everytime this song from D.H.T. comes on the radio, I feel pain. I just don't like it. I would just rather pick up a Roxette album and hear the real version of the song instead of this tainted piece of garbage. Come up with something original will ya? Geez."
4,aWsOmE cD!!!,"Great CD to listen to. Roxette sang Listen To Your Heart in the 80's-90's that was a good song, now its even better with an up beat dance to the song featuring Edmee. Other songs are very good too. A must buy CD if you're into dance type of music with vocals."
4,Powerful performance.,"If this is your first masters DVD it isn't really an instruction video in the traditional sence. The master class DVD's are more centered around performance of the insturment in a band setting. Loads of info on how to play with people, some licks but mostly how to be a good musician.This one is a little more performanced based than the Gadd or Sanchez DVD's. Very good none the less."
5,Exclellent case,"is perfect for many camera size, protect the camera very well, and can carry some accesories, is very confortable and discrtet"
5,Great value,"This wine rack is easy to put together, it is vey sturdy, and looks nice. The end bars are a great accessory to safely stack bottles. The size and height are perfect. Great price also."
3,Very good value,Pretty heavy duty though the chroming has much to be desired. It was pretty bad in some areas.I'm just using this out of site in the basement.For the money you can't go wrong.
2,Dull and disappointing,"I enjoyed the early 90s disc ""Mastery of Money"" (interesting blend of drones and location recordings) and I was hoping this would be an extension of those ideas. I suppose it is, but what happened? 62 long minutes of synthesizer drone - there may (?) be strings in the mix but the overall effect is artificial, opaque, machine. Every few minutes we get an overtone drizzle. An hour later it ends. Uneventful is one way of describing this, cynical is another (""my tiny cult will buy anything""), but mostly it feels lazy. Maybe there's a special process involved? I call this the alchemical excuse. ""His music is much better [more important] than it sounds.""Granted, AMK was trying too hard in the 80s, but at least the cut-and-paste stuff was entertaining. ""Cleave"" seems cold and inaccessible by design. Your money would be better spent on nearly anything else. I recommend Eno's ""Thursday Afternoon"" for beauty, depth, and organic process - everything missing here."
2,"AIDS, AIDS, AIDS","This story was of a woman who deals with the betrayal of her fiance and best friend as well as the consequences of it. The story was not very good for me. It seemed like a big lesson about AIDS/HIV which is ok because its a big problem going on today, but it's something I'm not interested in reading about. I thought the story would get deep with God but it failed to do that with me. I think it failed because the things that happened seemed exaggerated and dramatic than it was suppose to be. It was like watching a movie with bad actors."
5,Wonderful,"Keshia Dawn's first attempt in the literary world is simply wonderful. This prolific writer took a subject that many of us never think about, or feel will never show it's face within the realms of our world, and weaved it into a heartfelt story that made me feel compassion for all of the characters involved. I read By the Grace of God in two hours. I didn't have to, but I just didn't want to put it down. This novel drew me into the pages, and when I read the final word on the last page, although I wanted more, I felt more than satisfied. If I had a choice between eating or reading, I'd choose By the Grace of God. This novel will give you an abundance for your mind, body, and soul."
2,Tastes fine at first..,This stuff smells good and tastes fine at first but it is way too sweet and leaves that aftertaste of fake sugar. No thanks.
2,Not For Us,"I recently bought a box of the Jolly Time kettle corn popcorn because the store was out of our favorite brand.To be concise Mrs. Spudman and I did NOT have a jolly time eating this popcorn. It's excessively salty and tastes nothing like the kettle corn popcorn we are used to. It's so bad that even splitting a bag, we couldn't finish eating this one bag of popcorn. Treat it wasn't. Even Piper our begging shih tzu turned her nose up when offered a few pieces.Maybe we got a bad batch, but I'm not willing to buy more of this disastrous snack to find out for sure."
4,Healthy Snack,"I really like this popcorn and go through it so fast, although Orville Redibacker's smartpop version is better. If you're looking for the tradional kettle corn however, don't order it. It's not as sweet and does not have all that oil that makes the true kettle corn flavor so it may not be what you're looking for."
5,jolly time healthy pop kettle corn,"I could not find this product in any of the stores that use to carry it.When I got on the internet to find it, amazon.com came to my rescue. It is very good popcorn and I was glad that I could find it for the stores no longer handle this popcorn. I have ordered from amazon.com before and have always been more than happy about the way they handle their orders."
3,I wanted to like it,"I searched the site for a book that I might like. I came upon Ms Yorke's book by accident and I went out that night and bought it. I found the beginning hard to get through and I kept going with hope that it would get better. I thought that there were too many characters, brought in at weird places, to keep track of. I also think that Kate, the main character, fit in and took charge of this closed town way too quickly; therefore, to me, somewhat unrealistic. I do think that she showed much more strength than most people who lost their infant son. There were some good messages in the book that could be applied to a lot of our lives when it comes to love and perserverance. Overall, I thought it was an OK book but not one that I would recommend to people."
3,Haynes Automoyive anti-lock Brake system,I was looking for a more technical book being that the ABS system is rather complictaed. This is a basic basic basic book that will provide some knowledge of the operation but not enough for a repair.
1,Not a repair Manual,"I purchased this book with the expectation to find some useful practical, information, which would be of some help in servicing my brake system. No such luck here! This book proved to be utterly useless for this purpose any information covered between its covers can be found and in most every case explained in a much more useful manner and automobile specific for free through a simple Google search."
3,"NOT A BAD BOOK FOR THE MONEY, BUT TRIES TO COVER TOO MANY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS","A decent book if you're looking for the basics of ABS systems. Gives an overview of both the domestic and import ABS systems in use at the time of publication. Additional info on YOUR vehicle's system is still necessary, in my opinion, to effectively troubleshoot and diagnose specific problems and identify defective components. A good starting point if you don't have any other books covering your brakes."
5,WOW!! MS. MELI'SA MORGAN,"WOW MELI'SA MORGAN HAS PLENTY OF STYLE. THIS CD LADIES IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF HIGH CLASS, CONFIDENCE, AND MORE... THANKS AMAZON AGAIN FOR THE EXCELLENT PRICES. YOU GUYS ROCK!!!HIGH MAINTENANCE..... IT'S ALL ABOUT SEXY ME"
4,Theology of the Diaconate,"This book is highly recommended for those wondering about the future of the Roman Catholic Diaconate. Two of the authors are themselves deacons. The third is very much involved in giving lectures, courses and conferences on Church minitries. They look at the past of the Diaconate and speculate about its future."
5,What a fantastic journey!,"I have recommended this book to almost anyone who will listen to me, whether they are interested in India or not! It is sad, funny, informative and a bit scary. It doesn't leave you when you've finished it. You think about the Truck Road, the people who won't allow touching, the absolute poverty and all the goodness given to make you feel welcome...depending on 'where' you are at the particular junction of the book.I have never been to India. I've learned to understand Hindi, although, I would never be so presumptuous to speak it. I have studied the country and it's history for the last few years. This book gave me more insight, in the three days it took to read, then all the books I've read in the past. Take the time to read it. Savor it and enjoy!"
1,"Season Two -- Boo, Boo.",Happy Days Season Two has been maliciously tampered with. Don't waste your time or money on this travesty.
1,no music,"There was a considerable lag time between the first and second year. Itwas my understanding that Paramount was working out the music issues. They have done the customers as well as a fine show a serious injusticeby taking all the music out. There is no reason that a compromise betweenthe cost of the music, and the cost of the dvd could not have been arranged. Paramount should be ashamed of itself!!! Hopefully if they decide to distribute season 3 that these issues can be resolved, not tomention reworking Season 2, and give the customers what they paid for."
2,"NOT A ""HAPPY"" CAMPER.........................","THE WORST PART ABOUT THIS ""NO 50'S MUSIC THING"" IS THE EPISODE WHERE RICHIE PLAYS A TEEN D.J. AND ""ALL"" THE MUSIC HE PLAYS IS FAKE OLD NOISE, PLUS THE FILM IS ""CUT"" WHERE THE MUSIC WAS REPLACED. DO NOT BUY THESE DVD'S UNLESS YOU ENJOY THROWING UP. NOTHING WORST THAN WATCHING SOMETHING ""CUT"", MOSTLY WHEN YOU THINK IT WILL ALL BE THERE. I GUESS I'LL GO BACK TO TAPING THE EPISODES ON TV-LAND TO GET IT RIGHT, AS FOR THESE SORRY DVD'S I GOT, I'LL JUST USE THEM FOR TARGET PRACTICE. I MIGHT SOMEDAY RUN INTO A PARAMONT REP'..............."
1,What were they thinking?,"Normally I review a product after I purchase it, but in this case I hope my one star vote will get the attention of the producers of this set. SHAME ON YOU!I am on the boycott bandwagon. I won't purchase this set until the original music is restored. *Counterfits* of the original music score just won't fly and this set will not find a cherished place in my video library as it is now.Yes, I WANT to purchase this series! So, PLEASE fix it! Until then, my money stays in my pocket."
1,Sad Days,"No, Todd, I won't be buying the set. The music being absent is a big part, but from what everyone says about the picture quality there is no way I'm paying $30 for that. I will rent them first and MAYBE I'll find one used for cheap someday. Blame the greedy record companies for the music issues, blame Paramount for the video issues."
1,Why?,My two favorite shows growing up in Denmark was Alf & Happy Days. Both shows have been edited and changed for DVD release. Don't the responsible people in USA know what a golden piece of culture they are mutilating whith these changes of favorite american shows? I would have payed anything for this DVD - if it was done right!
4,Happy Days two,"I received Happy Days season two as a Christmas gift and even after reading many of the negative reviews, I've found that I enjoyed it very much. The changing of the music was only glaringly obvious in a few episodes: The Haunted House, Cruisin, and Fonzie joins the band. Otherwise, I don't think I'd have even noticed if no one had mentioned it. The stories remain great--Fonzie's first Christmas with the Cunninghams, The New Job, and the Sickly Kiss are definite favorites. My kids adore it every bit as much as I did at their age. It does such a great job of portraying the struggles of teenage hormones in a wholesome and fun but not naive, saccharine,or raunchy way. I love it and would definitely recommend it as a purchase!"
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY................,"I watched Happy Days when it was on TV back in the 70's,one of the things that made it, was the MUSIC. In this setall of the music has been edited and added, it has ruinedthe idea of watching the ""real"" thing, because the cheap-skate company that makes the sets, does not want to ""pay""to get the music that was shot in the show. This is theVERY REASON why China Beach has never been released.Disputes about the music."
3,Okay but not great,"Season two was good, but showed the spark was dying in this series. I think the writers were having problems, there were bizarre lapses in continuity. Somehow, their eldest son was dead or something. Most episodes are still well worth watching and I'm glad I purchased this."
1,BOYCOTT THIS GARBAGE! EDITED MUSIC LOW GRADE PICTURE AND SOUND!,This is really irritating! This show (at least in the early years) is as good as any show ever was! The fact that the studio is too cheap to pay for the rights to the music is ridiculous! To add insult to injury the picture and sound go from very good to bargain basement quality during some episodes?! I think everyone who bought this or any other show that has been altered should return the shows for a full refund. Let the cheapskate studio eat the loss instead of making the fans digest this SH**!
1,"No soul,no shame,NO SALE",Do yourself a favor and skip this.Edited music has taken ALL of the heart and soul out of this early classic.Only the first 3 season are worth anyone's time and the butcher job to the original soundtrack is the worst decision by a studio head to date.Have they no shame? I already know the answer to that one!!!
1,It's just not the same.....,"The magic of the first 2 seasons of Happy Days was the opening of ""Rock Around The Clock"" and all the great rock and roll songs of the fifties. Season 2 has been totally altered and the excitement is lost. Shame on Paramount for dumping the great music in favor of generic instrumentals. What an injustice to a great TV show. The video quality for the first episode of the season is awful and the fact that it's out of sequence just makes it even worse. Granted, it may have aired this way, but why not correct the sequence on the DVD? This DVD set is truly a disappointment, especially after the excellent job they did with Season 1. Don't waste your money. Maybe Paramount will pull all these inferior DVD sets and re-release Season 2 the way it really was."
2,HAPPY DAYS -- THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON DVD,"I'm sorry to say -- it's true! Season 1 was perfect, but Season 2 is a hack job. The music is GONE!!! ""Rock Around The Clock"" is GONE! The background songs at Arnold's -- GONE!! I'm almost afraid to watch the episode where Ritchie becomes a disc jockey!Even the discs themselves look cheap -- generic gray faces.Bad set -- and I hear that WKRP season 1 is going to be worse!Sorry but my enthusiasm for this release is completely gone. I was only going to buy the first two seasons of Happy Days anyway because I really didn't like it when they went to the three camera format. But again -- you take away the msuci and all the life is completely sucked out of these shows."
2,Incomplete Second Season,"I'm in Japan and can't watch this on TV, so I'm happy the show was finally released. Happy Days has enough strengths that it can stand up without the music, but as I watch it without the real tunes, I can't get it out of my head that some entertainment-industry lawyers couldn't work out a deal for a bunch of songs that, come on, aren't worth very much anymore. How much can anyone expect to get for the Penguins' ""Earth Angel""? Hard to stomach, especially when the musicians and their estates never got anything to begin with. I wish members of entertainment oligopoly would be better stewards of the art they own. Further reading:Dirty Little Secrets of the Record Business: Why So Much Music You Hear Sucks"
2,CORPORATE GREED INDEED,"1) removal of original background music2) removal of Opening ""Rock Around the Clock"" theme song3) the film itself was not cleaned up/digitally restored as it could have been...you can still see the pops4) the new replacement music sucks and it's boring.5) new replacement music often does not suit the scene. Example : midtempo songs playing while crowd is notably dancing to more uptempo rhythm.very botched job, to say the least, and I think it would have been worth to pay the copyright fees for the songs.Stick to Season 1"
2,HAPPY DAZE,"I just received my season 2 DVD of Happy Days. I popped in the episode of ""Fish and the Fins"" waiting to go back to the years of watching this show as a 10 year old. I thought, ""here we go"", after seeing the record changer opening sequence. I couldn't wait to hear 'Rock Around the Clock', by Bill Haley and the Comets. Instead of nostalgia, I get a feeling of anger when I hear the third season theme!! What the heck?It's nice to watch the eps uncut, but I have to fast forward past the theme because I cannot stomach the revision.The first two seasons of Happy Days were pure gold. It really struck the balance of comedy and nostalgia. Until this DVD release, I never realized how big of an impact the music played in evoking that nostalgia. Thanks CBS and Paramount for your great care in preserving this classic show... not!!!"
1,Thanks guys,"Thanks for your input on this DVD, nothing beats the original. Altered version DVD series is not my cup of tea."
2,Cheapo DVD Release,"I grew up with this show back in the 1970s and I still love it after all these years. But this DVD release of the second season is a letdown.The original music has left town and the picture quality ranges from third rate to a fuzzy nightmare.The quality of the season 1 DVDs was certainly not perfect, but it was pretty good. The season 2 release, on the other hand, is a shocker.The cheapo studios put naff all effort into this DVD release and it is such a shame - a classic and much-loved show like Happy Days deserved a lot more respect and TLC than this.I guess it's better than nothing. But not by much.I'm glad I only paid a tenner for it at the local department store.Hopefully things get better with seasons 3 & 4."
5,Happy Days--Season Two,"This is a great product, with lots of fun episodes! I would reccommend it to anyone who likes funny shows or family shows (or good TV in general), especially since good shows are hard to find these days. I can't wait until more seasons of Happy Days come out on DVD; I want to buy them all!"
5,Mr. Carl,"I don't know what these other critics are talking about. This collection deserves five stars because it DOES have the original music, including the song ""Happy Days"" at the beginning of each episode, in this collection. And unless the original second season had the song ""Rock around the clock"" at the beginning of each episode instead when they original aired, - which I was too young to remember back then - then it DOES have ALL of the original music. The collection is a MUST for any reasonable ""Happy Days"" fan, at least."
1,"HAPPY DAYS SEASON 2, WHAT A BUST!!","Watching the first episode from this second season it becomes immediately obvious even after the now lame opening credits, that the music was changed within the show to generic instruments. Plus, we were given a 2nd generation film copy of the show which obviously was needed to mess with the music and soundtrack. The First season they used original negatives, but we get the quality of a syndicated copied version...I wont stand this...This is half a job at best. If they couldnt do it original, they should not have done it at all, or waited to negotiate further with music licensers..the original flavor has been removed. I will watch my vhs version taped from tv before I watch this new dvd. Please re-release it...I recommend people leaving these on the shelves at the local store!!"
3,Here we go again with the dumb music changes!,"Well I just read on [...] that Happy Days Season 2 will have music changes.Also The Rock around The clock theme has been replaced with the Happy Days song featured in the 3rd season to the last season.You know I'm realy getting tired of my favorite shows getting butcherd on DVD!I sure hope Paramount has not done what they did with Family Ties,delete scenes from the episodes? I still plan on getting this set as it contains one of my favorite episodes-The Christmas episode where Fonzie is to ashamed to admit he has no one to spend Christmas with,dont reacll if there was any music in that episode as I have not scene that episode in a while.Will find out in a few weeks."
1,I Was Just About to Buy This!,"And I am so glad I read the reviews first and found out that all the original music including the opening song ""Rock Around the Clock"" is gone!I am sick and tired of DVD collections that are being release without the original music!!Why release it?The sales will always be bad once people find out all the original music is gone.The are much better off paying for the rights and making their money back with better sales then not buying the rights to the music and make no money with lousy sales.The first two seasons of Happy Days are by far the best in the series.What a shame they did this on the second season!"
1,Total Garbage,"Not the original music!!! Picture looks like fuzzy crap, very upset about the whole boxset...Do not buy this junk"
3,THEY RIPPED THE SOUL OUT OF HAPPY DAYS,"Hard to complain about the lack of original music on this set when that has been more than advertised by other reviewers. I only went ahead and bought this it while taking advantage of a great Amazon sale a few weeks ago in which I paid a very reasonable price for it. Fact is the episodes on this show are really flattened by the substraction of the classic music. The main title is specially ridiculous as the Happy Days theme has taken over ""Rock around the clock"" with the action cleary not matching the music. I wish the soundtrack hadn't been such a big part of the success of this show but by doing this Paramount has made that very clear. The result is average at best. What's next: a music-less American Graffiti ?"
1,pollyannasister,the product is already broken-looks like it has already been put back together once--the rod part of stand was pieced at the bottom and is already broken
2,looks nice for a short while - cheaply made,"Looks nice when you first get it, but did not withstand the elements for very long. I live in a pretty temperate climate (bay area, ca) and it broke fairly quickly. Originally purchased because it looked really nice for such a low price. I guess you get what you pay for...Unless you are going to have it in a covered or protected area, don't even bother..."
5,Compelling,"Bev-E, I LOVE YOU. Your strength is unbelievable. I hope that you will get a chance to see my comment. I am also a survivor of many ills, and reading your book and feel your strength has help me to overcome. You are an amazing woman. I wish I could hug you."
5,""" TOUCHING""","I THOUGHT THIS WAS A VERY GOOD READ!! I ENJOYED THIS BOOK SO MUCH THAT I AM GOING TO PURCHASE IT AGAIN! I LOANED THE BOOK TO MY 18 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER, WHO HAD STOPPED READING, SHE ENJOYED THE BOOK SO MUCH THAT SHE DOES NOT WANT TO RETURN IT, BUT THE BEST PART, IT STARTED HER READING AGAIN!!!"
5,SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS MUST GET THIS BOOK,"I am a senior UNIX system administrator with a book shelf full of references. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST BOOK I HAVE SEEN ON EITHER UNIX OR WINDOWS NT.We recently began introducing Windows NT into our large enterprise. I needed a good reference for the work ahead. I purchased two other books on the integration subject before discovering the Williams-Gardner book. The other books were half the size with far less credible information. I strongly recommend this book as the definitive guide. It is well organized, authoritative and comprehensive. I also really like the reference chapters at the end. I can throw away my Nutshell books as well thanks to this book.I can't say enough positive about how valuable this book is for my job."
2,Pacing too fast / insufficient instruction,"The intermediate routine in this DVD presents the exercises included in a studio mat class using a magic circle. As someone who takes studio classes 3 times a week, I was familiar with the routine. Nonetheless, I found the pacing too fast with insufficient time allowed to transition from one exercise to the next. (The DVD assumes that you can transition immediately from one move to the next.) Also, I thought that the audio guidance was insufficient. For example, for the single leg circles exercise, the instructor does not tell you when to change legs. If you are doing the exercise, you are on your back and you can't look to see when the demonstrator changes legs. If someone who has been taking classes for about 3 years finds it difficult to keep pace, I think this DVD would be unmanageable for a beginner."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"If you are used to the typical work out type video this is not for you. It's hard to explain - there is no real workout, it is one or two people demonstrating each move with a narrator. At the top of the screen they tell you how many reps to do. It goes way too fast to work out with the DVD, it is more educational to learn the moves and then do them on your own. If you already know the moves and form as I do, this will not give you a good workout."
3,Slightly disappointed,"This video essentially incorporates the magic circle into the standard Pilates mat work. It doesn't demonstrate all the possibilities for using the magic circle (there are no arm exercises, for example) and in my opinion falls short of featuring new and varied exercises."
4,Excellent Buy - Real Pilates!!,"I am very happy with this DVD. THIS is REALLY Pilates!!!I am not a pilates novice(though I had not been practicing it for a couple months), so I knew what I wanted from my ""at home"" Pilates work out. I was concerned about ending up with something less than what I know to be the true Pilates method (there is so much of that out there).I found this DVD challenging enough, yet not too daunting...The instructor/narrator was very careful to describe both form and breathing techniques in a way that was easy to follow.I also like that it is divided into Beginners, Intermediate etc, so that you can work at a suitable pace and degree of difficulty.Editing the DVD that way also alows for variation of workouts, keeping things interesting....A great buy!!!"
5,If you own this please read this!,"I like this and have the magic circle , already know that this is good but how long are each segments ? and how many exercises do each section has? which muscles are being worked? is this really effective? please write a review and answer this!!!!!!!! please thanks."
1,Could not get this to play,"I purchased this DVD, and could not get it to play in my DVD player. I sent it back for exchange, and received another identical disk that it too would not play. I sent it back for a refund, and was never able to view it. I never thought to try it in my computer, bur realize now that could have been the compatibility issue. Oddly, the DVD has the symbol on it that it should work in any and all DVD players in the US..."
3,Not the worst. Not the best,"First of all, it won't play in my DVD player. I think it's foreign in origin and has compatibility issues. I can play it on my computer, however.The best thing about this dvd is that the workouts are truely challenging--something to work towards.The worst (other than it won't play on my dvd) is the difference between the beginner's workout (too easy and slow) and the intermediate (challenging, but very quick in the transitions--and the commentary does not always follow the movements so you have to continously look at the screen).The advanced workouts are truely advanced--some of the moves impossible (and dangerous I'd venture) for someone at the intermediate level. It certainly gives you something to aspire to.All in all, this isn't a bad dvd if you want something authentic. No cheerleaders here. These guys are serious about their pilates"
3,"Got to go with the majority, IT SHOULD HAVE COME WITH KRYPTO!","Okay, so we were warned in the fine print under the manufacturer's disclaimer. But those of us who are shopping for kids probably have kids, and who has time to do all that reading!?KRYPTO is featured in the photo, so when I opened the box just a few days before my son's birthday, I was not happy to be left scrambling for the KRYPTO figure.If it's not in the box, don't put it in the photo without giving us better warning!!! Last sentence at the bottom of the page is just wrong!!!"
4,Cool toy but don't forget the action figures are not included!,"The rocket is really big and sturdy, has great sounds and moving parts. I'm glad I noticed that the action figures were not included or I would have had one dissappointed little boy on my hands. You must order the action figures separately, although all pictures of the rocket show the action figure inside. So all in all it was a good toy and good value, but recommend the DVD and action figure set to go with it."
1,Krypto Rocket Toy,"Toy came in great condition however, we did send it back. When we opened the box up we did not like the size of it. Expect a VERY BIG toy. And we just don't need another HUGE toy that our son will end up not using or carrying.It looks like a lot of fun...the size just turned us off."
2,Not so fun and too big,"I't was too big and my kid did not pay that much attention, he played for a while then throw it away."
3,Not sufficient,"The book was helpful to me for the simple fact that I dont have any other book on composite charts. However, the interpretation of each aspect was rather bland. Outer planet aspects were interpretted on an individual level, rather than composite, which does not help at all. Aspects to the North Node were mentioned rarely.My main difficulty with this book is that 1/4-1/2 of each interpretation involves work relationships. This could be helpful to some, but was a waste in my case. The rest of it was about love, which is what I was focusing on, but the amount spent on work relationships could have been spent on friendships or family relationships. Hopefully, they come out with a stronger, expanded edition."
3,Good but overrated,"THis is an interesting book and maybe even an important one, since the author is one of the inventors of Composite charts, but it ends up being little more than a cookbook and at times is a stretch of the imagination because the theory of composites is a little too neat. I expected a little more : you'll be disappointed if you're looking for a serious book for professionals."
2,Difficult to understand,"Starting with the chapter on how to construct a chart, the first sentence is, ""Mathematically, constructing a composite chart from two natal charts is simple,"" what followed, left me in utter confusion. The author lets you know you can contruct these charts on a computer, but doesn't expound. The best thing I found in this book, is the form you can mail in, and have them do a chart for you."
3,Prove it,"I have a great deal of respect for Mr. Townley and have long admired his work. This book certainly encourages the midpoint disbelievers to give it a chance. I was left disappointed though, as there is never any answer given to the why it works and I don't find midpoints to be astrologically based.Perhaps it is my bias though that made me unwilling to give this book a higher score. The author spends a great deal of time explaining how to do composite charts and explaining the placements found in a composite chart. I didn't like how he never explained why it works or its significance or at very least, its purpose."
4,Consider this a preview version,"If you're considering getting Pimsleur's Comprehensive Portuguese program but aren't sure if you should spend over $200 on it, consider this a demo version. For a much, much cheaper price, it'll let you preview the program and see if Pimsleur works for you.I will say that it does for me - I was able to absorb and assimilate everything taught in it.Now, it doesn't teach a heck of a lot. You'll be able to ask where a hotel is, and as long as nobody tries to give you actual directions beyond ""over there"", you're fine. Also as long as you don't plan on ever counting above seven. And if you only ever want to speak to people formally. There is also no reading or writing, and coming from English some of the spellings WILL surprise you.Again, I consider this a preview. I now know that A) Pimsleur programs do work for me, and B) I am OK with Portuguese in general. I am now a LOT more comfortable spending money on the comprehensive product."
3,"So,So","I like that it's an audio cd b/c I can listen to the pronounciation of the words. But I realized that the male and female narrators pronounce the same words ""differently."" The female speaker is a lot clearer when she pronounces the words, and when the guy says it...sometimes I'm like, ""What did he just say?"" All in all, its ok and I now know ""alittle"" bit of Portuguese. btw, I rented this for free from my library."
5,Pimsleur Quick & Simple Brazilian Portuguese,"This is a very easy way to learn some basic Portuguese......no note-taking or written words. Just listen and learn how to form simple sentences and get the accent right. The repetition is a tremendous help, too. I've never studied other languages formally, but this makes me want to learn more! I plan to purchase the next set of CD's before my trip to Brazil this Christmas. I've learned most of these 8 lessons in about 6 weeks and I'm 65 years old!Pat from Oklahoma"
5,Pimsleur -- English for Portuguese Speakers,"I had purchased this product in February for my friend in Brazil. She did not receive it. No one knew where it was - the Post Office, nor Amazon.com. It seems that there is no record of it at all, except the email that my friend received that it had been sent.So, I ordered another copy and had it sent to my house. I purchased a used copy with a cracked case (otherwise in perfect condition) and got it for about half the price of a new one. It came to my house in good time. I sent it on to my friend in a package with other items. She has received it but has not yet had a chance to begin studying. I believe that my friend and her husband will be able to get a good foundation for the trip to the US that they are hoping to take next year.I know that I have not given a review of the effect that the product had on my friends, but I am sure that it will help them a lot."
3,"Low tech audio CD, great for iPod or car.","Although there is definitely an advantage to see and hear on some of the interactive language CD's out there that required a pc, there is a distinct advantage to some audio language lessons that you can load on an iPod or just listen to on your car's CD player. I like to listen to audio brazilian portuguese audio CD's while out walking, working-out, traveling or grocery shopping. These audio CD's make it easy to practice a little each day."
1,No book study for a true beginer on learning a new language....,"I don't know others but myself, a true beginer of Portuguese, really have no way to learn with just a audio CD even I am currently in Sao Paulo. By just listening I don't know a thing. Taking away all visual aid, the learning is so limited, especially you are helping yourself without a teacher by your side! My recommendation is to get a audio with book if you are a serious self learner."
3,Bait and switch!,"I thought the first eight lessons were great and really enjoyed learning from them. Based on that alone, I would have given them a 5-start rating. However, I became extremely frustrated and felt ""tricked"" when I looked up the remaining lessons and discovered they cost [a lot]... I felt like the inexpensive introductory lessons ... were luring you into buying their more advanced and overpriced products. I also don't understand why their CD-sets are almost 20% more expensive than their cassette-tape sets. I really want to learn Portuguese, but I certainly cannot afford to spend [that much money]."
4,Pimsleur method in general.....,"These intro sets in Pimsluer Method are basically priced to whet your appetite for their more costly full sets. I have to say that you will not go from zero to sixty with these simple sets. In general , as other reviewers have noted, this is a completely audio system , so you are never familiarised with recognizuing the written form of the language....you will definitely need a basic Portuguese beginners text to really functionally learn the language. Also a strong foundation in Spanish or another Romance language is going to be needed, unless your recall of gramatical entities such as infinitives, gerunds, past participles, preterite, future perfect etc. are well polished. I will say this , however, if you combine all the above with the full Three parts of the Pimsleur Program....you can arrive in Brazil and essentially hit the ground running."
1,Did we read the same book?,"A high school guidance counselor could write a better job hunting book then this! Dr. Mornell has so little to say he resorted to using a huge 14 pt type font so he could fill up 187 pages. His best answer for the standard ""What are your five-year goals?"" is "" You can evaluate my work in three, six, or twelve months - and if it's excellent, we can decided how to best use my talents within the company."" In my opinion this answer is vague and shows the job candidate has no ambition, no incentive to take ownership of his career, no plan and no sense of direction. If you are serious about finding a job, order ""Knock 'em Dead 2001"" by Martin Yale and get serious answers from a pro on really tough interview questions."
5,PRICELESS INFO FOR THE JOB SEEKER,"THIS BOOK IS A PLEASURE TO READ,BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED,AND AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR SERIOUS JOB SEEKERS LOOKING FOR QUALITY IN A CAREER...THE DUE DILLIGENCE THAT HIRERS ARE URGED TO USE IS TOO RARELY URGED AND INSTRUCTED ABOUT FROM THE HIREE'S VIEWPOINT....... TOO BAD THERE IS NOT A 6 STAR RATING...THIS WOULD ABSOLUTELY MERIT IT."
5,Packed with job-seeker strategies and insights!,"An excellent title that will appeal to job-seekers, offering savvy insights and tips, Dr. Pierre Mornell's Games Companies Play is for employees who would learn how to win the games companies play during the hiring process, from resumes and trick questions to negotiating job offers. Chapters are packed with strategies and insights."
2,Lacking some very necessary details,"Pierre Mornell's, 'Games Companies Play,' makes for a quick and easy 2 hour or so read - printed in enormous type with a sparse page layout readers will effortlessly glide from start to finish without so much as utilizing a sprinkling of brain power. While this book does serve nicely as a very general overview of the job search and hiring process, those who are in need of more nuts and bolts information will be sorely disappointed with what this book has to offer."
5,Great books to have on your shelf and keep forever,"I am by no means a manga expert, which is probably just the kind of person this book would appeal to. This series was written in the seventies and is now reintroduced to the English-speaking public with a new translation. This is an example of exactly the kind of story that lends itsself so well to ""comics"". It's amazing how much meaning and emotion can be captured through these beautifully simplified drawings. You can read this as an adult and enjoy it, but teenagers, even little children can understand it (unless you're offended by cartoon boobies) This fourth book is a must have if you have any of the others. It culminates with a very important part of Siddhartha's life, and makes me all the more excited to read the 5th and 6th book!"
5,Amazing!,"Just as incredible as the rest of the series. I recommend it to everyone! I've re-read it many times, and you always pick up new things with each read."
4,A helpful guide,"I purchased both this manual and the Haynes equivalent for my 1980 GS850 before I found out that the official Suzuki workshop manual is available online for free. However, I've found that this is very good reference overall and has plenty of photos and charts to go along with instructions. I particularly like the full-page parts diagrams. I have to remove one star, however, because they skip over some relatively straightforward procedures (like rebuilding the brakes) as beyond the abilities the backyard mechanic."
3,GS850g manaul,"This manual was as stated, used. It was not abused, all pages and pictures are usable. The packing was a bit less than I would have done. It rained and the book was a bit damp when I got it. Still it is a good usable book. Thanks."
4,HASBRO'S GOT IT RIGHT!,"Finally hasbro get it right, they manage to make cloth robes right which allows for more great action poses! Also they are very durable to being thrown, dropped etc. And we are finally geting better sculpted accessories and hasbro still manage to include kickass articulation to there figures! And Ki-Adi-Mundi could be a start to a very cool collection, he comes with a lightsaber blade and hilt (can be attached),display stand, removable clothing and belt! So why wait? By ROTS figures now!"
4,Cell Phone and Plan,"This cell phone has been great. The service is perfect for our area. We never have and dropped calls or times when we can't make a call. The 450 minutes are all we need, but I do feel that the price is a little high for such a small plan."
3,Good History DVD,"I was kinda hoping that this DVD would play well on a LCD TV, but due to low resolution of the video, I was a little disappointed. Some scenes were actually out of focus. The narration of Pierce Brosnan was actually pretty good. I do think that if the quality of the DVD was sharper I would have enjoyed it more. Maybe some day they will remaster it to a higher resolution."
4,Fresh and dreamy avantgarde brit-pop.,"Prepare for slowish, dreamy glam-poppy but very fresh songs. Once dicovered, bound to be good for at least one big hit."
5,Excellent Italian-English dictionary at a very affordable price,"Great paperback dictionary for American English speakers who are studying Italian and as a quick reference for those who want to check something. Not only is the Italian to English section comprehensive in providing multiple forms of words that vary by gender or number, it adds value by including idiomatic expressions that employ the word. The front sections on Italian spelling and pronunciation, grammatical tables, table of regular endings of Italian verbs, and model verbs with six tenses are wonderful references ""at a glance."""
4,Great combination of size and quick reference,"The size {and weight} of this is great w/ helpful grammatical tables of the definite articles, pronouns and adjectives as well as useful verb tables and model verbs not found in my textbook which made a huge difference doing my homework. I did purchase a second dictionary that was heavier and seems to have more obscure words in it but this has still been a great buy for me. I haven't taken it out for a trial run in Italy yet but would definitely bring it along as I'm sure it will be more travel friendly than the other dictionary I bought which is heavier and thicker."
5,Same Book for Latin Excellent!,"The Bantam New College Latin & English Dictionary, Revised EditionI have decided to buy the Italian-American version of my Latin-English ppb by the same publisher. Their Latin dictionary is abundant with commmon word combinations, helps for those of us with no knowledge of grammar, and an easy to read font. I have been served well over the years by my always handy Latin/English version of this book; it has a lot of mileage on it, and is still in very good condition for such an oft used paperback. Thanks for your reviews, which made my descion to buy the Italian/American version easy."
4,A good product,"This little book seems quite complete, and the tables in the front are very helpful. The print on the pages smudges easily, but that is a function of the (probably) recycled paper. It is still a good value for the price."
4,still lovely,"After a year, it's still a lovely coffee pot - it stays out on stove even when the kitchen is clean. Heavy duty, good coffee, and worth the extra cost."
3,There are betters out there,"Good Workout but you really do need a step to get the full effect. Don't get me wrong, it is a good workout. This just isn't classic Jillian and I have seen better out of her."
4,french rap!,"if you like rap and hip-hop, you'll like the beats and the flow of this album. my friend brought this cd back from france recently, and it's awesome. i would highly recommend it to anyone, you don't need to speak french to love it!"
2,Snore,"Drone, drone, buildings, rivers, drone, drone. Too much left out or minimized (e.g., Dodgson's work with math, logic, puzzles). Just the one guy talking. Very few examples shown (no family newsletters, very thin on non-Alice material). His rooms at Oxford not shown. The Alice shop at Oxford not mentioned or shown. Russian trip mentioned, but no views of Russia. There are quotations, but not many and not the best. Dodgson's massive guilt trip glossed over, hypochondria overemphasized. Justification of nude photography undermined by statement that he liked to go to the beach to see scantily clad children (haven't heard this anywhere else). Sorry. I was prepared to like and defend this video, but I just can't."
2,disillusioned,"Sadly, this documentary is a mere slow moving attempt @ using visual fluff to beat around the bush. The viewer follows redundant scenery as the narrator drones on about Carroll's mundane life as a math professor until the film finally reaches its point. The narrator intermittently hints about Carroll's fascination & attachment to a real life friend named, ""Alice."" Alice is a child & Carroll is an adult who often photographs her naked. The disillusioning part is not the length of this boring film, but the fact that the narrator actually has the audacity to frame Carroll's practice in the context of a culturally appropriate pass time for that period in time. It's no wonder Carroll's character, ""Alice"" has to follow a path of confusion. I'm sure that little girl's life felt maddening @ times indeed. Today, Carroll would not be a legend. He would be a registered sex offender."
5,work of art,"I bought this chair for my daughter's ""under the sea"" room and it's absolutely gorgeous. I expect that when she grows up she will bring it to her new home and enjoy it for many years to come."
5,Good on drumsticks,My line uses this this tape on the sticks and it dosen't get too sticky and it dosen't break too easily. It usually takes 5 games worth of rimshots to get through it :P
4,Great on Snare Sticks,This is our drum line's preferred tape for snare sticks and even bass mallets. Good quality tape that holds up well.
3,marty's videos,"A great video for fans that like the young Marty, and his band. The part I wished more of was him at the grand old opry and his actions on stage with his band members, overall good video and audio. Will be a least a keeper for country fans alike"
1,What are ya'll thinking?,"I've read so many good reviews, so I thought I should try it. I am an advanced yoga addict and was looking forward to something new. This just aint it. Most of it is some sort of lame meditation, way too short to be meaningful. Just an excuse to stop the workout and catch your breath. For the workout itself, well, it's more like aerobics than yoga. You might twist your neck and shoulders while doing it. I'm sure it's good for something but it didn't make me feel at all like a real yoga practice would do (try Shiva Rea, now that's perfection). Not the same relaxation and ease. Just bad, very bad. Waste of money."
4,Give It A Chance,"This is one of RaviAna's earliest productions and it shows. The production quality is very low, and for that reason, I waited a long time to try and acquire this practice. However, I was delightfully surprised with it. I especially love the warm-up and open-up and use it often as a mini-practice all on its own. It is one of their longer practices at 80 minutes; however, it easily lends itself to being broken up into sections. Plus, if you don't like the set, remember that Kundalini is mainly done with the eyes shut, so it is a small factor."
3,Gurmukh is much better.,"This DVD doesn't hold a candle to the Gaiam Kundalini DVD.It's a decent workout (great ab workout in the second segment), but if you are looking for a superb Kundalini yoga video, get the Gaiam Kundalini Yoga video with Gurmukh.Ravi Singh has the WORST music in this video, it sounds like background soap opera music from the 80's, and the see-through white sports bra of the lady in the video is not necessary.Also, the backdrop is boring and Ravi's narration sounds very bland and scripted.I guess I have just been spoiled by Gurmukh's video."
2,Production value extremely inferior to other Ana & Ravi DVDs,"I am really surprised no one else has commented on this. I own 2 Ana Brett & Ravi Singh DVDs: Fat Free Yoga: Lose Weight & Feel great, and Dance the Chakras. I was so drawn into these fantastic dvds due to Ana's vibrant, calm nature, and Ravi's terrific cuing and soothing voice that I wanted to purchase all of their dvds. CAVEAT EMPTOR!! The Cleanse & Purify as well as Total Tune up dvds are overwhelmingly inferior to the 2 I mentioned above. The lighting, staging, directing and whole ""feel"" of these dvds can't compare. I even emailed their site to let them know. Has anyone out there found the same thing? I can wholeheartedly recommned the 1st 2 I mentioned, however. They are an ecstatic and vital addition to my practice."
5,Great Workout and so much fun!,"I love these four 20 minute sets. Ana is gorgeous and great to watch, Ravi does an inspired voiceover.The workout is always fun and interesting. Makes me wonder why so many yoga DVDs have to be so boring! I like the music and the workout is challenging. It is also perfect if you have a hard time following workouts on DVD. You can practically do these workouts with your eyes closed. The exercises work and there is no needless chitchat before the workout you get right into it."
2,Tant Pis,"This is a poorly written, entirely inaccurate book. But that is fate. Schneider did not have a chance to edit and rewrite it, and the result is chaotic. Had he lived, it might have done greater justice to his tenacity, if not his talent.I read this with chagrin."
2,Bad book,"Example: ""Every time you open or close a form and [sic] report, you activate [sic] the On Open [sic] and On Close [sic] events.""I've never heard of anyone ""activating"" an event before. There is no ""On Open"" event. There's an Open event, which can be associated with an OnOpen method.The book is full of stuff like this. On the plus side, the writer's weird style is a refreshing change from the documentation regurgitation in other books."
2,Beginners Beware!!!,"While this book may be a good REFERENCE, it should NOT be touted as a book for beginners. There are so many instances of unclear explanations (and sometimes incorrect explanations, such as on p64 when the ""Add new record"" button is labelled as being the ""Filter by selection"" button) in the FIRST PART OF THE BOOK that I don't know how a true beginner could suffer it.Explanations like ""and then click the Show Table button (a thick yellow plus sign)"" (p 33) are rediculous when a picture of the icon could have easily been inserted. Another huge problem is how advanced concepts are casually mentioned in the introductory pages of the book - this may be fine for a more experienced user who knows that these terms will eventually be explained, but I'm sure it would be quite overwhelming for a beginning user."
3,"Fairly ""easy"" for a Jillian workout","I saw this DVD in a two pack w/the maximize - full frontal at a local discount store & since I enjoy Jillian's other DVDs (30DS, NMTZ, & BFBM) thought I'd give these a try. I've done both DVDs & prefer her newer DVDs. I dont think they are as hard or as intense as her other DVDs, I wasnt sore the next day after either workout & w/her other DVDs I'm always sore the next day. They are both fast paced & relatively short workouts but they do make you sweat & are good when you are short on time."
1,Don't do it!,"Wow, what a way to hurt yourself! Warming up by jumping around and then no stretch. Jumping jacks and more while holding weights -- there's a way to hurt your joints if you're not ready for it. The pelvic tilts were a nightmare -- too much arch in the lower back.There's no instruction on how to do the exercises properly and without hurting yourself.I'm glad I checked this out from the library and didn't waste my money on it."
5,Quick Results,"I got this DVD along with the front DVD and saw results really quickly! I'm talking I lost 4 pounds the first week and I wasn't even doing the workout fully yet! It is tough, but it's done in a short period of time which is excellent for me. You only need some weights and a stepper to do this routine."
4,"Seems Intense, Not for Beginners","I must confess I have not actually tried the exercises in this dvd but I did watch them and can tell, based on my own experience plus watching and following along with other exercise dvd's, that this one is not for beginners. As one reviewer pointed out, many will need to warm up just to be able to do the warm ups - all of the exercises are performed very, very fast compared to what I've seen in other videos, and they aren't that easy if you aren't already in good shape. That said, there is one person in there who performs the easier version of many of the exercises but the problem is that often the camera doesn't even show her so you don't know how to do the less intense version. Instead, it seems to focus mainly on keeping up the pace and pushing yourself to the limit (or even beyond). This looks like a good workout, but beginners will have to ease into it. Like I said, I haven't done the exercises yet but I already know it is going to be a struggle!"
3,Reading comprehension issues,For some reason I thought this was a workout video. It is an instructional video with tips and references for the different part of the body.
