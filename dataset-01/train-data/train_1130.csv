4,family feature about forgiveness,"The story is about how a family must first overcome their own anger,and feelings of sorrow to forgive and grow,after their youngest son accidently shoots and kills his older brother(Cain)in the field,while collecting eggs for breakfast.When he covers up the incident from his family and they eventually find the son,the mother grows silently angry and resents the youngest boy for the loss of her son.The father becomes cold and distant as well to spare his feeling for his wife(Close).The grandfather takes in the youngest son,and along the way teaches the son,to come to grips with what he has done and to confess the truth to the parents about the death of the eldest son,so the family can come together to begin to heal in the end and realize that accidents do happen and we should bond together to learn to forgive,heal and understand that we are all not perfect and grow from those mistakes in life."
5,Intriguing Perspective,"An intriguing perspective on 12 Step programs. Having written a book about walking that fine line between compassion and codependence, I found this book insightful and inspiring. - Rita Schiano, author of Sweet Bitter Love"
2,Not for me,"This book may be good for someone who is struggling with a substance and needs to read about someone's story of how they broke through and realized what helped them and what didn't. The book dragged on for me, I guess I expected a talk more on the twelve steps and enlightenment. Instead the book talks about this man's life and his struggles with alcohol and drugs. I kept opening the book thinking it would grab me, but almost halfway through the book, I gave it a final close. Not a horrible book, just didn't have anything that kept me interested."
3,"Fun, but be careful!","I had a wooden one of these when I was young and it was a lot of fun. This version is very thin plastic, and the blade is a little sharp. My 5 year old actually cut her thumb a little when she spun it the wrong way. The other drawback is the wooden version has more weight and actually flies a little further. I will be returning the others I purchased for the wooden model."
4,Simple Fun!,"My son is 14 and loves this toy. It's just fun. No batteries, no plugs, no strings attached! I would recommend this toy."
2,Mediocre,"Apparently, this book was done in a haste. The title could not have come from the author. There is not much ground stuff such as what a function object really is and how to use it. There is not much up stuff such as how a particular algorithm is implemented, either. The examples presented are too easy going and shallow. Some ""IN_DEPTH"" sections in the book are OK."
3,Good for beginners.,This book is good for beginners. But unlike what the cover says it does not make you the master in STL. Still a good start.
1,Yet another bad Schildt Book,"I read this book in the lounge at work while bored. While the author has a good writing style, it is full of scads of technical errors and many programming practices that should not be imitated.This phenomenon is not unheard of for Mr. Schildt either. Many of his past books have been received very badly by the C/C++ community. For that reason, I think it's irresponsible for him to proclaim himself as an ""authority"" and ""master"". What he should do is take on a reviewer for his books with more technical skill than he posesses.So in conclusion, I'm saddened to have to inform you that this book is not worth your money. To recommend a good book for you, I can vouch for this one: ""The C++ Standard Library : A Tutorial and Reference"". But have a look around, there are other good ones."
5,Want to know about the STL? Try this!,"If the online help that comes with your compiler for the STL isn't enough, then I would recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn about the STL. It is useful for beginners, intermediate users and those who wish for a thorough explanation of areas which they may not be proficient in. It thoroughly covers the containers, algorithms, allocators and concludes with more advanced topics. The book is filled with lots of good examples and a clear writing style which gets right to the point."
4,Nice book,"The Ultimate Guide is well written and the pictures are nice and sharp so the book is very beautiful to look at, but its weakness rests on VERY uninformative maps! All in all the book is worth getting, IMO."
5,Cidekick,"I have been using Cidekick for years, and it makes the herbicide more effective, making repeat applications less necessary. Price was competitive, and shipping was fast."
5,"Great Performance, No Lyrics?","The music's good. It would be nice if the lyrics can be included, or downloadable from somewhere."
5,Very please,I recently purchased this item and since I had to take my lil kitty to the vet. I brought him home three days ago and he immediately took to this litter box. So far it is working as expected with no problems. I like to travel on extended weekends when possible so I have high hopes this product will afford me the ability. I am please with this product but will re-post in a month.
1,Broke within one week,I'll update this review if all gets fixed but I bought this thing because I was going on vacation and I came back to a dead litter robot full of poop. I even had someone checking it daily and they told me it just stopped powering up. There are other issues like the cats will try to get in it while it's cleaning and it can get gummed up pretty fast. It may be a very awesome litter box if I can get it fixed. I emailed support which is supposed to respond until 10PM EST but received no response.
3,Wish the box was larger,"This litter box is good as far as the self cleaning goes, however, I wish it was larger on the inside. I have large cats and they have a hard time finding room inside to do their business. We can't put much litter inside because they will kick it out. If you have small cats, I think this would be a great litter box for you."
5,5 years later.... just now ordering our 2nd,"My mother in law got us the Litter Robot (LR 1) 5 years ago. We have 3 cats and I cannot tell you how much we've saved in litter over the years since we've gotten this. I have to buy litter maybe every 4 months? We used to go through a tub or two a month before (our cats demand clean litter).After 5 years our plug doesn't always want to stay plugged into the base and we're looking at getting another one for upstairs (and hoping we can fix the one in our garage).The only thing I've ever had issue with (before now) is that after a while, like anything plastic, it starts to smell no matter how much you take it apart and wash it. I contacted Litter Robot and they suggested a liquid ammonia remover (i.e. fish tank ammonia remover)... works GREAT!!!! Almost like having a new machine!Going to try the LR2 and if it's anything like the LR1, it will be amazing!"
2,had 2 and they broke within 5 months,"I really liked the idea of this product because it is self-celf cleaning, it separates the waste for removal, reduces smell , and I love the asthetic appeal of the product- very sci fi. However I have purchased 2 of these and the first one lasted the longest but started to break down about 5 months after I got it when the motor broke and then the second one broke down honestly within 2 months max and that was when it stopped flushing automatically and that would cause the litter to back up to the point where when I did try to flush it, it created problems. Increased smell, and made it so that I would have to spend hours trying to clean it with a garden house.Litter Robot LRII Automatic Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Black"
1,"When it works, it works fine, but...",I read many glowing reviews on this product before purchasing and in fact was impressed with the way it did work. Unfortunately it kept getting stuck which defeated the purpose of a device that functioned without constant intervention. I would come home from a day's 12 hour shift and find the unit non-functional and my cats with their legs crossed. I do have 2 cats and they tended to trigger it frequently in play. I ended up sending it back and did get a full refund after trying it for 6 weeks.
4,Good Product,"Overall this product works better than other self-cleaning litter boxes. It's extremely easy to assemble, slightly loud during the cleaning cycle. Takes up a lot of space; be prepared to for the large size. It has more than enough space for larger cats though! Removing the dirty litter is extremely easy; cleaning the globe is a little more tedious. My older cat was terrified of it so unfortunately it did not work out for me. If your guys are a little more brave, I would definitely recommend this product!"
1,Great but the little sliding flap breaks easily,"I actually love this litter box, or I did until it broke. I have had a couple of littermaid units and was never very happy with them. The litter robot worked great, but when I tried to clean it, I broke the little sliding door flap. It snapped in two easily. I've tried glue it a couple of times with JB weld but it broke again. I'm going to order another one as it's still the best litterbox I've ever found. I'm hoping I can fix the old one well enough to use it while I'm cleaning the other one. I think if they used a stronger material for the little sliding door flap it would be a fantastic unit. For the price of this one, it should be made of better material."
1,Cat was TERRIFIED,"This seemed great, but my cat absolutely would not go in this thing. It's really big and he was so frightened that I left his old litter box next to it so he'd know where to go and so he'd go. As a result, he never tried it. Since this was the case, I removed the old litter box and he relieved himself on a little Elmo couch we have and in a duffle bag (which was good because we could just throw them away). Anyway, we ended up having to return the Litter Robot and give him his old litter box back. He won this battle."
5,before you order,"I was very impressed with this product. My cats, however, were not. My cats, age 10, have only been in a carrier about 3 times and that was traumatic..and shun anything made for cats' enjoyment..I should know by now. For young cats and those liking to go into holes or used to a covered litter box, this product would be great."
2,Small Cats Only,"While the litter Robot is a clever idea, it is much too small for a grown cat. The description suggests it is suitable for cats weighing less than 15 pounds. My 13 pound cat simply didn't fit inside. So be warned. little cats only!"
1,Broke after a few months...,"Can't wait to deal with customer service, they sound horrible...Sensor never worked, cats took some time to start using it. Even starting it manually though, it was great for a month there..."
5,Worth the Extra $$$!!!!!!!,"This product is absoltely GENIUS!!! I originally bought a Littermaid litter box, only to take it back to the store after 10 days. It was a total piece of junk. I was hesitant to spend $300 on a litter box, but I am so glad I did. Our kitty's closet no longer smells....AT ALL!!! For the liners, I have been using jumbo disposable litterbox liners. I just put the bag in there and fold the excess over all of the edges.I don't tuck it into those little holes because litter or waste can get outside of the bag sometimes.The oversized liner will actually cover the step to the entryway, which is good because that step has little holes in it that the smell can get through. But this takes care of that problem and it's a snap to empty out! I LOVE MY LITTER ROBOT!!! Now, if only they had a ""DOG-POOP-IN-THE-YARD ROBOT""............"
3,UFO Aftershock,I would like to write a review for this product but it WILL NOT PLAY ON WINDOWS VISTA!!! I didn't find this out until I went to the official website to find out why it wouldn't load or kept crashing. So don't buy this product if you got suckered in to buying the Edisel I mean Vista.
3,Played the Demo (overseas demo),"<<Update at the bottom.>>...and this game SO reminds me of a current-technology update of the favorite X-Com that this game is derived from.This game has evolved from it's previous incarnations. Better tech, Diplomacy, Research and Manufacturing. Multiple bases and Character advancement for each of your squadmembers.I encourage you to download the demo before buying the game if you have broadband, it is worth the look. I actually didn't like the previous UFO game, and didn't play it 30 minutes. This demo sold me to this game.(The average rating is because I have yet to play the WHOLE game in all it's complexity.)JW<Update>The games pirate protection may cause your PC to blue screen at times. The blue screen will happen whether you are playing or not. I finally had to ditch the game - uninstall it completely. I only got 5 missions into the game. Good game - bad protection.bummer.JW"
2,"Good Game, lots of bugs, bad experience","This would be a fantastic game if the developers actually worked out the bugs. To date they have not, even with a 1.2 patch.The turn based strategy game had me hooked for months until I reached a point in the game where one of the many glitches meant I was unable to complete the mission. Upon reading associated forums, I could fix this problem if I restarted an earlier saved mission (2 solid weeks worth) or emailed the saved game to the developers. I have been waiting two weeks for this 'fixed' save game to be sent back. Really annoyed, by all accounts I was just one piece of research away from finishing. I have no faith in this software developer and consequently will never buy one of their products again."
2,Not Quite,"Nice graphics and good ragdoll physics do not make the game any more fun. It's pretty good for a while but ultimately the player is just killing time as (s)he waits for the next plot point to unfold. The variety of weapons is okay and not as xenophillic as in the original, but really, it's not as fun as the original X-Com. Moreover, it's rife with all sorts of bugs and the nefarious StarForce copyright protection, so, -1 star for tech."
1,needs some help,"well i prefer aftershock then this one. the opening of the ugly anoying guy talking is sorta anoyance i would much rather have read it, and it kept on hitting problems after problems with bugs, one of which was anoying every time i moved the screen would flip out like crazy till they were done moveing, some times it would even freeze. i am sure it is ot like that for every one but on mine it was sorta after a day i just deleted it. i am sure it is a good game if you have a copy that does not screw up all the time"
5,Most authentic and easy to use book on Indian cookery EVER!!,I was born in India and have a plethora of cookbooks dedicated to Indian cookery - my favourites are ones by Madhur Jaffrey. But this book by Raghavan Iyer is really very good. The photos are beautiful and make everything look just like it did on the table when I was growing up. Iyer's comments are interesting and helpful and the recipes are written with ingredients readily available in the U.S. I highly recommend this book to both people that are fmailiar with Indian cooking and to those that are experimenting.
2,Can Betty Crocker Really Cook Indian?,"This is a good book for people with a casual interest in Indian cooking but if you are really looking for that rich tapestry of flavor and texture that is truly Indian cooking you may be disappointed. The book's ingredients and preparation methods are relatively simple, making it easy for newcomers to make their favorite Indian dish or try out a new chutney. However, Indian cooking is all about spices and I believe the authors compromised on taste in the interests of simplicity. The recipes I fixed looked great but always seemed to be lacking in terms of taste. After trying a dozen recipes with lack luster results I discarded this cookbook in favor of other books with more authentic tastes. In summary, if you want great illustrations and some easy recipes give this book a try. If you truly want to experience the tastes of India, I recommend you try Lord Krishna's Cuisine: The Art of Indian Vegetarian Cooking or The Spice is Right: Easy Indian Cooking for Today."
5,"Easy to make, Tastes great!","This book is tremendous. I can only re-emphasize what other reviewers have written: the recipes are easy to follow, the ingredient lists are not intimidating, and the food tastes great! I have tried other Indian recipe sources in the past and have been disappointed with the results. But the recipes in this book produce beautiful, flavorful dishes that, while perhaps not restaurant quality, are far better than I had ever hoped to produce at home! Chefs of all skill levels will find this an excellent resource on Indian cooking."
4,I hate bra shopping! :-),"I would rather have my nails torn off than go to the store to try on bras. Once I finally find one that fits and doesn't make me feel like a mutant, that style is not carried the next time I go. That is what happened my last trip to the mall, so I decided to check on Amazon for the style I liked some time ago. Looking it up by the style number was easy, and ordering easy as well. And the prices were actually better than the sale price at the mall stores. I like this bra, it is as comfortable as a bra can possibly be, and fits me well. It is good for no-show, too."
3,Padding still too thick,"I love Vanity Fair bras. I am a 34 DD, and most full figured bras make me stick out like a couple of torpedos. Vanity Fair makes me look natural. This said, I was disappointed. The padding was not as thin as I expected. I cut it out, and LOVE it."
1,Bad watch but Good return policy,"After much research on watches, I decided to go for this Tissot PRS200.It was reasonably priced(for a swiss brand) and looked good.However the watch was a complete let down when I received it.It may have looked beautiful, but it did not do the most basic function that we expect from a watch....keep the time.It always ran a hour or two late.I returned the watch 3 days after I received it.The only bright spot in the entire order was that JTV watches refunded me promptly for the entire amount.On the whole it has been a very disgusting and frustrating first experience with Tissot."
5,Great product,"This is the best stuff for stopping toe nail bleeds. The powders that are available just can't do the job and over time the powder clumps and hardens. This gel is always ready to go. It can be messy and will stain so be careful. But other than that, it is wonderful."
4,Great product!,I really have used Kwik-Stop in the past & found it works great. I am happy to say I have not used this Gel form yet. And for my babies toes...I hope I never do. But I am very curious to try it in gel form. Will update if & when we have to use it.
3,I Follow Asensio,"I have been following Asensio since the Solv-Ex scandal. A friend of mine tried to convince me to invest in Solv-Ex. I found Asensio on when I started to research the stock.I never invested in Solvex because of Asensio. My friend lost about 100K.This man is brilliant. He has been incredibly accurate. He is living proof that the effecient market theory is impossibly wrong.The interesting thing to note is the venom that is railed against him. Read these reviews on Amazon!Asensio's current short pick is KFx. KFx has a ratio of stock price to company sales of over 1,200. Its revenue in the past four quarters was about $950,000, and the stock market values the company at over $1 billion.Do the math. This man is a market hero."
1,Asensio is the one doing the deceiving,"I find it bizzare that Manuel Asensio, shameless promoter of himself, claims to ""Uncover Deception in the Markets."" Don't get me wrong, I believe Short selling is important and guys like Tisch and many others bring alot of value to the market through Hedging and other short selling strategies.But from direct personal experience, I've found Asensio picks stocks of a certain size irrelevant of their growth potential (and that have alot of shares available to short) and then shorts the stock to oblivion while issuing all sorts of poorly supported half truths and lies in the press and through PR agencies AFTER he's shorted all these stocks. If you know anything about investing, this is technically illegal and most definitely unethical.If he told you how he really made money in this book, they'd throw him in the same country club jail they threw Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken.Read this book with a skeptical eye."
2,poor writing,"Its written more like an autobiography, waste of money in my opinion, the best-relatively- is the last part ""how to sell short"", most important its waste of time."
2,Nothing about how to short a stock !,"The whole book is about how ""he"" shorted stocks. Nothing about technical or even fundamental analysis.As the other reader commented earlier, he would short a stock and then go ""bad mouth"" or ""share his insights"" on the website or in public paper.Gained nothing about reading this book. Save your money for other books !"
1,Useless book,"No one needs to read this book. Yes, there are stock market frauds, price manipulations, and other dastardly tactics. One man is as prone to error as the next, including the author.Nothing is certain. Life is about risk. Greater rewards entail greater risks. If you're a small investor with no inside information, you are especially likely to get duped. Fine. That's a good lesson.The author goes too far. If everyone followed his advice, there would be no IPOs, no new companies, no banks, no investment of any sort. And just as some investors complain about negative predictions, some short-sellers protest too much about the high hopes of risk-takers. Not all the unfortunate stocks in this book are scams. Sometimes, things just don't turn out the way we want them to.Read Warren Buffet, not this guy."
4,Best Squad Based Jungle Warfare Game Out There,ok first off i would like to say that this is one of my most favorite games for X-box next to Halo. The storyline is the best but what do you expect with it being from Tom Clancy. The graphics though have very much stayed the same but they are still very good. The best quality of this game is its Online capability. you can download new multiplayer maps or play with some of the best Ghosts out there. If you own the first one i strongly suggest you buy this one or even if you don't own the first its a must buy. But Be prepared to spend hours on just strategising where to advance your men. This game is very difficult. Also there is a new feature if you have the X-Box Live pack you can say orders to your men on where to go and where to shoot!!! So what are you waiting for go buy this game.
3,"A very basic, objective-based, covert-style sneak and shoot.","The setting as you might expect, is marshy/rainy/muggy type environment. This game is just another version of the similarly-structured Ghost Recon series. Many people might find this game utterly boring and uneventful, but I like the way I can switch back and forth between the assigned soldiers. You can control each of the soldiers 1 at a time, and utilize their individual characteristics. The other soldiers in your unit immediately follow your lead and cover you as you switch amongst them. Take out a tower guard from afar as a sniper, then disable a surface to air artillery piece as a demolitions expert, or neutralize enemy on a plantation as a rifleman."
4,Good Maps. Climate Effects But.......,"Unlike the first Ghost Recon which had 14 levels, this one only had eight. And I flew through them. Wish it was longer. I do recommend it for all new strategy players but it should have been longer. :o("
5,A new Game ?,"Having just received the game and having played all the Tom Clancy Rainbow Six, Ghost recon Games before on the PC it was what I expected, this is just my type of game but I was a bit disappointed, having no XBox live function, living in the middle east thats a luxury, I only had the one player mode which I expect leaves out about 50% of the features, I was still disappointed as there were only 18 tasks to complete unlike Ghost Recon original where there were 50. Still I enjoyed playing the game, having to discover all the maps and a few new weapons, the graphics are good and having a surround system juts adds to the effect. I am now busily trying to break out all the specialists, hopefully there will be lots of new weapons and characters there, have only found one new character out of 4 so far. Looking forward to Rainbow 6 (3) for a totally new experience in the Tom Clancy series, hopefully I will have finihsed Island Thunder by the time it is released."
2,Ghost Recon: Island thunder,Ghost Recon is a good game but in both Ghost Recon and Ghost Recon: Island Thunder there were only about eight levels. This is very frustrating because you finish the game very quickly. I do not recomend buying this item.
2,not for kids 13 and under,"this was a cool game, but it was very hard.I think this game is not for childern 13 and under because its very very hard."
3,better but too short,"This game improves on alot of the errors from the first gameand ads alot more. 8 missions will take about 2 hrs to beat, but since I got it for 15 bucks it was worth it. I dont have time to sit around for hrs on end playing on Live so I cant really give this game a higher rating do to its lack of single player missions."
5,Great game if you liked the first.,"Ghost Recon: Island Thunder is an expansion pack to the Xbox game, Ghost Recon. Like the original, you are part of a squad of four US ""Ghosts"". The graphics, which were excellent, have much stayed the same. This game plays like the orginal, in which you can try to use stealth, or a guns-blazing approach, although stealth is preferred. It does not require the original game to play.Like the first one, Ghost Recon: Island Thunder will support online play, via Xbox Live. There will be a lot more multiplayer maps. If you liked the first one, I suggest buying this. Also, if you liked SOCOM on PS2, you will also like this."
2,Too easy!,"The gameplay and graphics are great! BUT the amount of missions is weak. In the campaign mode there are only like 8 missions. The first one had a lot more missions to complete, and it had a lot more stuff to open up by completing different missions in your dossier. I'm sure it is good if you have the xbox live, but if you don't have it, it is really easy. I beat all the missions on elite the first time through, so it took me like an hour and a half to beat the whole game. Good to rent but wouldn't recommend buying it."
2,rainbow six three or ghost recon,Ok game with amazing graphics. In ghost recon you kill kill and kill thats it. kinda boring. The multi player sucks. A must get game is rainbow six three. Best game ever for online. During missions you can talk to your computer team and give them commands through a xbox live communicator.
2,Waste of money,"These batteries really suck, I just wasted my money buying them. They develop memory way too easily and eventually their life is gone."
1,Worthless,"I might as well have a piece of Scotch tape on my arm. All I can figure is maybe they stick you with this worthless product so you'll buy the ""upgraded"" version after realizing that this one does NOTHING."
1,Weight Loss Patch,This did absolutely nothing for me. I tried it for 2 weeks. I did not feel different or have less of an appetite. Waste of money!
1,As useful as a bandage,"This product did absolutely nothing. No change in energy, appetite, I went back a couple times in the few days I used it to see if I was doing something wrong. I guess a product with no warning or instructions should be expected to have next to no impact. AWEFUL purchase."
3,Grandbaby likes to look at this toy but...,"Grandbaby loves to look at this toy which is on her car seat bar, but it would be nice it were a little more ""lax"" and hang down it bit more so that she can reach it. IT is very tightly wound and not like the picture and more stretched out. I thought it might relax after time but it doesn't. I have it on her car seat bar and once in the car seat, you can slide it down the side of the bar and she is able to reach it a little and I can hear her playing with it. I purchased it because she has the Whoozit Cosmic water teether, which is a rattle version and she that so much loves it. It brings a smile to her face every time she sees it and would highly recommend that toy. I would have given the Activity Spiral 5 stars if she could actually reach it and manipulate it."
3,Not flexible enough,"My daughter received this for Christmas and at first I was excited about it because I thought it would be great to attach to her car seat, etc. The truth is, however, just like many of the other reviews have stated, it does not stretch out long enough to go across the car seat handle, it just bunches up all together so the toys are difficult to differentiate. I own a Fisher Price baby papasan, and the solution I have found is to tape one end of the toy to one end of the ""leaf stem"" and stretch it out, taping the other end down as well. My daughter has shown more interest in it since doing that, but is not a perfect solution because the tape eventually comes loose. I also foresee many more problems with it once she can actually reach out and grab it!"
3,Good but not Great,"While I like this toy it's not as great as i thought it would be. i thought that it would be more flexbile or bendy so that you could put it in interesting places for the baby to play with but that is not the case. so somewhat disappointing as it makes it less functional than i'd hoped, but the baby likes the colours and that it jiggles when you pull the cord so a good toy but not a great one!"
5,Finally...,"Finally a toy that makes sense! This is the best thing we've had for the carseat, the carrier, the stroller, or to take along when we spend the night away from home...It's colorful, interactive, soft (safe even in the car) - my girl enjoys it. It's ultra-practical, easy to attach to just about anything a baby would spend time in, easy to clean, easy to carry - mommy enjoys it, too! Highly recommended!"
1,not safe,"I used to have this wrapped around the arch of our Gymini by Tiny Love. However, I removed it once baby started using her hands in opposition to each other, because she could pull it off, and as such it presents a strangulation hazard. I still let her use it, but only under supervision. I have it wrapped around one of the straps on my Ergo baby carrier."
5,Bridget,"I was given an older version of this toy by my sister in law. It was 'hand me down' and is pretty much the best toy we have. You can attach to anything! Car seat, stroller, bouncy seat.....you name it! Both my babies loved to chew the little knots on the whoozit face, and never lost interest in all of the things to look at and grab. The best part is that when it gets dirty you can just throw in the washing machine.You will not regret this purchase, your baby will LOVE it."
4,Spiral Toy,"This toy is like a spring and can only stretch about 18 inches or so and still attach to anything. It should either be longer or bendable to be a real adition to a play gym. It's not what I expected, but I still gave it 4 stars because my daughter likes to have it set in front of her during tummy time, and it is bright and interesting."
2,Expensive for what you get (and the picture is misleading),"I bought this because the colors looked so bright and the attachments looked interesting - I thought for sure my baby would love it. However, when I first introduced this to my baby, she cried every time she saw it (I always had to switch it out with another toy). Part of the problem is that it doesn't stretch out on the car seat handle - it just stays bunched together and the attachments stay almost in one big clump. Since she is just an infant, she cannot pull the ball that shakes - so it's pretty much useless. The only good part is that this item is machine washable...but even so, it's not worth $20. Save your money and buy something else."
5,Love it.,"This rug is plush and beautiful. It's excactly what I was looking for. I needed it for my daughter's room since it has hard wood floors I wanted something really thick and soft for her to play on. This is perfect.First the company sent me a tan colored one, but I was able to easily exchange it for the off-white color that is pictured. Some reviews say the tan color felt more plush, but to me they were both exactly the same except, of course, for the color."
3,Judas Priest . . . growing into a metal band,"This record show a much harder metallic edge than their debut, 'Rocka Rolla' (1974). Considering that it is widely considered (and correctly so) the bands's first quality record, it is unfortunate the the band has disavowed it (by discouraging fans from purchasing the latest reissue). ""Victim of Changes"" is simply a great song, in its plodding beats. ""Dreamer Deceiver/Deceiver"" is a great moment as well. So too is the schitzophrenia of ""Prelude/Tyrant"". However, the record does tend to suffer from overproduction at times - take ""The Ripper"", for example - of which there is a far superior version on 'Unleashed in the East' (1979)."
3,A journey for the right sound,"This is the album where Priest introduced a heavier sound. But they are far away from their trademark riffing and their legendary musical style. The only real classic which is typically Judas Priest is ""The Ripper""(a song that is still played at live shows). This does not mean that the other songs are bad, but they are not great hits and you hear that Halford and his bandmates haven't found their own sound yet. For the Die-Hard Priest fan it is a must have, but definitely ""Sad Wings..."" isn't Priest's masterpiece. 3 points mostly for the great ""Ripper"" and the good vocals from Rob ""Metal God"" Halford."
5,"Often overlooked by so-called ""fans""","This CD is the one that did all the fame for the band. I mean look at my fictionious last name! Tell me where did that come from! I want to tell (...)Yep that was your quote, look how blown it is. Anyway, to each and every song:1. Victim of Changes: 5/5 I loved this song from the very first listen. I still like it and i thought it was a cool song to start off with.2. The Ripper: 7/5 My names says it all!3. Dreamer Deciever: 5/5 Good JP stuff4. Deciever: 5/5 ditto #3.5. Prelude: 4/56. Tyrant: 5/5 very underrated song!7. Genocide: 4/5 the title just turns me on!8. Epitaph: 5/59. Island of Domination: 5/5 Starts off very weird but gets a lot better!Conclusion: This is for anyone who wants to get into Judas, starting album. Hey better 26 years later then not i suppose."
5,Best Priest Album In my Opinion,"I've been a Priest fan a long time. I love every album they put out, but I always seen to return to Sad Wings of Destiny. If your a person who only knows ""Breakin'the Law"" and ""You Got Another Thing Coming"" them your missing out. This album is timeless and is a must have for any Priest fan. Another review said that Dreamer Deceiver was a descent ballad. He's messed up. In my opinion it's the best ballad I've ever heard. This album does not have any bad songs. Buy it NOW!!"
4,The first truly great Judas Priest album!,"It didn't take Judas Priest long to build on the strengths of ""Rocka Rolla"" and create an album that is quite close to heavy metal perfection and remains to this day one of their best.This is a dark, moody masterpiece that would herald further excellence to come such as ""Stained Class"" and ""Killing Machine/Hell Bent For Leather"".Having said that, it is different from what would come after it. It is darker, and there are still some noticeable influences, especially Black Sabbath (not to be wondered at from fellow ""Brummies"") but also Queen on the likes of ""Epitaph"".Glenn Tipton plays piano on a couple of tracks. Don't let that put you off, because his playing adds to the overall mood. I'm not one of those who believes that the occasional keyboard bit kills heaviness. Look at Don Airey and especially Jon Lord for excellent HM keyboards.The only reason this is getting four instead of five stars is because I would love to see a remaster!"
3,"Great Album, Crappy Remaster","First and foremost, I give the album in itself 4 stars for being an innovative peice of work! Songs such as ""Victim Of Changes"", ""Tyrant"", ""The Ripper"", and ""Dreamer Deciever/Deciever"" are true classics!That being said, The current Koch pressing of it totally blows!The Low end is boosted as it were a hip-hop album.In conlusion, If you're gonna buy this album from amazon.com go to the import section and buy the Victor Version, it's much better than the Koch version."
5,It took me back,"Sad Wings of Destiny is high quality, hard hitting metal. I don't think Judas Priest ever put out anything else as good as this album. I hadn't heard this album in over 20 years. The music hasn't lost a thing over time. You really can't go wrong with this album. It's one of the all time best albums in any genre."
5,FROM BACK COVER,"KANEThe Mystic swordsman battles the prophet of an ancient cult of evil that began before the birth of man.Out of the blackness of an almost-forgotten past, the cruel cult of Sataki has come to life again. Orted Ak-Ceddi, a daring outlaw, is its prophet. He draws thousands of converts to his Dark Crusade - a design to destroy mankind. His bloody cohorts conquer Shapeli, but they are defeated when they drive to vanquish the southern kingdoms. Orted knows he must have a powerful cavalry to launch a new drive - and Kane is the man who can command the conquest. But Kane intends no final victory for the Forces of Darkness."
5,My second favoret one!!,I have been a fan of this series for a year now and I have written 2 other reviews on this series. I'm so afraid that catty's father is stanton wouldn't that be freaky her father dating her friend but any way catty's boy Chris is sooo cool though I think he's up to something yea but you have to read it first. These books make me want to cry and laugh all at the same time waiting for the next is always excruciating! September I have to wait till September I think in going to like the 5th one the best of all because I have inkling that the main character is Stanton my favorite character I love him!!! If you've read any of my reviews before you would know that all ready. Lynne please don't kill of Stanton he's an innocent no matter that the atrox made him do!
5,Great Book,I read this book over the week-end and loved it. stanton played a great role in this one by the way he went out and helped Catty. The story also introduced a new character but Stanton is still my favorite. The scene at the park was the best with the merry-go-round.
3,Way better than its predecessors,"This is the best in the series so far. (I am currently reading the 5th book) Ewing's portrayl of Catty is the most realistic and fully realised. She even comes across well in the other books, her character is always well defined and unconfused. This book also focuses a little more on the technicalities of being a moon goddess than any of the others and sounds far less hokey in doing so. Stanton has a nice featuring role, which is good, because he is the strongest character in the whole series (the most interesting too, that bad boy that needs to be redeemed is always appealing). It is also nice to see a glimpse of another generation of Moon Goddesses and how someone else could be as frustrated with Maggie as I am. I hope this is a sign the rest of the series is picking up in quality."
5,Good,"Catty is one of my favorite characters (along with Serena). Catty a daughter of the moon has the power to time travel. It starts out with a call from a place saying Catty's mother has died. But Catty was found walking around a desert when she was 4, her mother abandoned her. So she goes to the place and while she is there, these old guys dressed in black come looking for her supposedly mother's body. But they have a strange electrical awe about them. So when they come in the lights sort of blinked. She is confused because they don't seem like Followers. (They later find out that they are Regulators) She goes back again but this time with Vanessa so they can stay invisible. They find a black moon amulet in her mother's possession. Also a mystery guy gives her the Scroll. Which eventually Catty will have to follow the path on it to defeat the Atrox. Her boyfriend Chris is also acting wierd lately. This is a must read if you're intrested in the series."
4,A very good battery for medical equipment.,"First, ignore the image. These are essentially generic batteries.I ordered one of these for use in a TENS unit, and was accidentally sent a NON-rechargeable lithium battery. After a brief email exchange, I bought a second battery, as I had already begun using the other one, and felt it improper to send it back used.THE GOOD: Once charged, it will last as long as your average alkaline battery, and delivers plenty of power. Of course, as this has only been used in a TENS unit (which sends current through the skin to ""overload"" the pain response), your mileage may vary.THE BAD: It does take quite a while to recharge, often more than 24 hours.THE UGLY: Occasionally, it takes over 48 hours to fully recharge.Ultimately, it is worth the price, and would gladly buy another."
2,It is a book of quotes,"I'm not sure what books the other reviewers were reading. This is a small book which is a mainly a quotebook. It has a few pages of writing in the beginning that summarize Yao's life in the NBA and some pages of photos in the middle. But the majority is one quote from Yao on each page. That's about it. It would be better to have some context, explanation, or follow up (or a lower book price). It doesn't take much time to read since there is not much writing, so if you want more you will be disappointed."
1,How not to purchase a VHS on how to fiberglass,I purchased this VHS ... and was totaly unhappy with it. The contants of this film were directed towards the purchase of their products and offered no useful information on how to use tools or how to produce any product or repair of fiberglass. I also called the company twice and tried to talk to a supervisor without any results.Please don't ever waste you money on this VHSRobert L. Cook
3,Not as Good as i Expected,Dante THomas is one of those urban white soul singers but much of the material that he sings is not up to par neither voacally nor musically. THe only good songs are FLY GOODBYE and MISS CALIFRONIA. Most of the other songs sound like some tired garbage from a decade ago but I can tell that with the right producers and music Dante can go far.
5,changing destructive adolescent behavior,"This book has very,very good information for teenager who are having problems at home or just in general.In today's world sometime children just want's to grow up too last. They may just stop taking with there parent's. I would recommended this book to any parent. Information in this book includes ways to increase desirable positive behavior, how to influence and motivate children. Most of all it offer effective communication skills and active lisitening skills. Try it for your family or purchase a copy for a loved one."
1,Misleading-Not the original artists,"What part of your page was supposed to give me clue that these were not the original artists? These aren't even second-rate musicians. They should be punished for their horrible performances, and Amazon should make a noticable sign that alerts their customers that these are untalented impersonators of rthe original artist."
4,Better as an occasional cartoon,"This is a comedy series based on what amounts to one joke, repeated in may different ways: the Addams members are a very functional and loving family, albeit a weird one. Thing keeps putting his hand in. Uncle Fester is an effeminate doofus. The kids are misfits in normal society, etc.There are funny moments, but this program can wear thin if you watch more than one episode per month. The plots are designed to show as many weird jokes as possible e.g., a person from the ordinary world confronting the upside down Addams household. The acting is fine but not remarkable. ""Seen it, heard it"" pretty much says it all."
4,nice set,"loved the series and now have the complete on disc. picture is of good quality(but i can't get that tune out of my head). i'm not much for the commentaries, but they were interesting. worth the purchase."
5,This is one of the all time great series of the early years,This series is one of the all time greats for it's time. The episodes are so funny for all ages. This is a must have for real lovers of old time TV.
4,Good,"If you remember watching these reruns in the 70's and 80's and have not seen them since - this is a treat... Just don't expect to sit down and watch more than 3 or 4 in a row... They are good, just a little repetitive."
5,Adams Family Complete TV Series,I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this. My husband is a big fan. It will be a nice suprise for him for Christmas.
5,great deal,"the ship was fast, the item its excelent, i love the adams family soo im so happy, and this was the best price i found."
5,Awesome!,What a great TV Series!! This was a just what my fiancé wanted!! I had never seen the tv series only the movies but now I've been watching this collection it makes me appreciate it so much! Where have all the good tv shows gone??
5,EXCELENT,I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT EVERY MUSLIM AND NON MUSLIM MUST READ THIS BOOK....IT IS REALLY EXCELENT
5,Easily my favorite tea,"I was given Hot Cinnamon Spice tea for Christmas and I drank it in less than a week. I had to get more, so while I was searching Amazon, I noticed this tea and it is perfection! Made with black tea as well as the 2 or 3 cinnamons found in ""Hot Cinnamon Spice"" tea, it is just what I crave in the morning, noon or night! This tea is great with sugar and cream or all by itself."
3,"Way too strong, but good for cider and cooking","I am a life-long tea drinker, and like my black tea strong and flavorful; I love the flavors of cinnamon and clove, oranges, etc as well in tea. I love chai tea, and often make my own, as some brands are too weak-flavored for me, but this tea is extremely over-powering, and actually too sweet for me. I have even made an entire pot of tea-my wonderful ""Brown Betty"" teapot-using 6 Tetley British Blend tea bags and one of these tea bags, and it was the only thing that could be tasted. I do, however, use these when making mulled cider; I place two or three of these in three quarts of cider -with 1/4 cup of honey and Bushmill's to taste-they do work wonderfully in cider, and in marinades for meat as well."
5,Everyone in my office loves this tea,"This tea is one of the best I've ever had. It has a strong cinnamon flavor, smells wonderful, and has a nice sweetness after it brews for at least 5 minutes. (I recommend just leaving the tea bag in as you drink, because the flavor gets stronger and I didn't notice any bitterness.)Everyone in my office tried this tea and loved it. Plus it made the whole floor smell like cinnamon."
2,ripoff & strange reviews,"taste & packaging were high quality but product is overpriced compared to ""Hot Cinnamon Spice"". Per Harney & Sons web site, the two products are EXACTLY THE SAME. Read their FAQ's & one of the first FAQ is PRECISELY about this. Unless a reviewer (AROBINSON in ""Hot Cinnamon Spice"" review, compared Spice & Sunset in a different package (sachet or teabag or loose leaf), there is absolutely no logical reason for the difference in taste (AND much higher price). I enjoyed the taste but felt it left a clove after-taste more than cinnamon. Seems like Harney is a quality Company with helpful info on the site but having 2 different names for the same EXACT product is strange/misleading. I am sorry I believed a review that lead me to think that there were 2 different products -- thanks! Product deserves 4 stars but I get crabby when I have been misled."
5,Great for this category of TV,"Very nice looking, works great and has a few features. Perfect for this simple category w/ the added bonus of a contemporary look. Recommend"
4,Great Album,"Comes with a great set of songs, at least what I needed of the album to give me. Where did the good music ever go off to anyhow? ;)"
4,A lighthearted mystery!,"Finally, I might have found another series of mystery books to read that are entertaining and not all blood and gore. Since my absolute favorite author Anne George died, that has been hard to do. I guess I am working backwards since this was the first book I read in the series. It will not be the last. I get the same feel of Charleston from her books as when I am there and I can relate with her feeling of being ""from away""."
1,Unspeakably Awful,"The author has managed to imitate Susan Wittig Albert and her China Bayles series in every detail, with one notable exception. It's bad. Very, very bad. The storytelling is on an amateur level, the characters are simplistic, and the style is almost unbearable. I simply couldn't push on beyond the repetitive and obvious misbehavior of the main character's twit friend, who appears to be more of a tedious bad joke than a sidekick. The heroine might loudly declare that she loves Charleston, but I wasn't made to fall instantly in love with it. It takes a pretty substandard read to make me stop and wish that trees hadn't died for the book, but this one managed it in record time."
3,"Too much ""Wailing""....","I have read every one of the Abby Timberlake books and have enjoyed them all...but this one had me scrambling to find her first books so I could reread them. Sure enough, Ms. Myers has changed her style of writing...her heroine now ""wails"" and ""screams"", and gnashes her teeth and chews the scenery on almost every page. One loses the flow of the story with all that wailing going on. Four stars for content, two for writing.."
2,Charleston 1 Abby Washburn 0,"This was my first Den of Antiquity mystery and I picked it up only because it is written about my favorite city, Charleston, SC. I found the tidbits about Charleston fascinating! They were funny, they were educational, they were fascinating and they were oh so true. It was great to read about so many of the local spots we frequent (Grace Church, The Market, Magnolia's, Poogan's Porch, The Citadel Mall, etc.). Unfortunately, the mystery was extremely trite. Halfway through, I had more than enough of many of the obnoxious characters including C.J. and Momma. The entire tale was totally unbelievable. I'm a great fan of mystery writers including Grafton, Hillerman, Patterson, Evanovich, Baldacci, etc. Too bad I won't be adding Myers to my list."
1,Skip it.,"There are so many threads started but never finished in this book. The author spent so much time on CJ's crackpot personality, Shelby and Granny Ledbetter stories that she forgot she was writing a mystery.CJ's stupidity as well as Abby's mother's (Mozella) just takes over the novel. It is impossible for Abby to get through her investigation without one or both of them running off at the mouth embarrassing her. I know that in the South they love their eccentrics, but in the North, those two are certifiable.You have to wonder how Abby manages to stay in business when she can't recognize an obvious fake, and she actually yells at someone and chases him away when he's trying to tell her something. She also relies on her new assistant far more than she should so that she can conduct her nosey investigations. She's made both mistakes in previous novels."
5,Indi Hip Hop/Bollywood Blast,This a great DVD especially since it goes along with a Zumba certification I'm getting ready to get! The DVD was well packaged and in great shape when I got it. Thanks a bunch! Suzette
1,Large is still too small,"First, the liners I got are not in the package pictured. Blue, not yellow, and tho ""large"" (30""x17"") not big enough for my litter pan. First one out of the pack ripped when I tried to fit it into the litter pan. Also, the yellow package pictured says ""Heavy Duty,"" and the one I got does not ... as I said, it ripped, so it is certainly not heavy duty. Too much money to pay for something totally useless."
3,Inaccuracies,"Fascinating book, but i'm only half way through and i already getting fed up with the inaccuracies ....eg Joni at Woodstock !!etc. If you look closely there are actually quite a few ... particularly when McDonough talks about subjects he is less knowledgeable about. It's a good book, but McDonough comes across as arrogant and some of his put-downs when comparing others with Young are frankly laughable. I realise that he wanted to put across his own viewpoint, but a little more humility wouldn't have gone amiss."
3,Shakeitout,"Not Bad Overall. Too long and too much insignificant detail about each band member during each session or tour. The Neil Young character carries the book through the minutia. Could have been done in about 200 pages. I think the author tries to hard to make this to be the Best Neil Young bio ever. More Young. Less Crazy Horse and David Briggs, etc."
4,Interesting read,"Having never really been interested in the 60s or the 70s hippie scene, I picked up this book on a whim not really knowing much about Neil Young; only that I liked his music and knew he'd been around a long time. His tenure in the music world is what made me interested in reading about him. I thought McDonough did a great job documenting Young's life given the subject's elusive nature and the amount of time that dragged out with the various roadblocks towards publishing the book. Young is extremely interesting and has lived many lives. It seems that you learn more about him from those around him than you do from the interviews with him. I definitely would recommend checking this book out as it miraculously will hold your interest for all 738 pages."
2,Better to Burn It Than To Read Away,"I am a big Neil Young fan, and I like biographies, so I should've liked this, right?Unfortunately, the writing is so tedious it was a struggle to get through. Jimmy McDonough seems more interested (or, perhaps I should say ""innarested"" as he does several times a page) in expounding on his own opinions than on Neil's. By about page 2 you realize Mr. McDonough is overly proud of the fact that he has cracked Neil's inner circle, and he spends the next 750 pages reinforcing how chummy he is with the principal characters. We get multi-page accounts of Mr. McDonough recounting how only he would tell Neil that he was being over commercial and over-exposed, then we skip years ahead to the next Jimmy-tells-Neil anecdote. I wanted a Neil Young bio, not a Jimmy McDonough bio.Die hard fans might -- and I stress the maybe -- be able to fight their way through this biography, but everyone else should stay away. Better to spend your money on some Neil Young CD's."
3,"Captivating story - , Bad Storytelling.","In the last year I've read a lot of biographies about popular musicians from the 60's and early 70's including the Rolling Stones, Clapton, Hendrix, Lennon, Morrison, and a book about the more recent rock legends, U2. This one is consistent with the genre with it's poor, unbiased, artist-glorifying writing. Earlier reviews reference the non-linear writing, biased appraisal, and general sloppiness of this book. For some reason most popular culture biographers don't seem to understand the need for a well crafted story, even when that story is based on fact.Regardless of the poor technical aspects, if you are into Neil Young specifically or music from the era generally, it is a very interesting and reasonably quick read."
3,Thorough read,"McDonough does a good job here cutting through all the B.S. surrounding the ""legend"" that is Neil Young. In doing so he paints a picture that does not come off glorifying the artist as so much a person, but as someone who has created some fine music."
2,Perspective,"Note to this biographer and anyone else planning a biography. Check your love or hatred at the doorstep of beginning your book. I get so tired of biographers being fans and critics slanting every bit of fascinating history into a morphed shape of their subject. Lots of good stuff (too much, maybe) in this book, but I winced every time the author talked about his feelings and his position in the story of Neil Young. I'm glad I read this, but I would have been happier editing this draft."
5,Shakey,We are very happy with our purchase. The book is in great condition and a great book and for a great price. Thank you
5,Love it,"This book gave me a deep appreciation of Neil that makes him even more so my musical hero. Jimmy M does a great job, I highly recommend this book!"
5,Superb read...,"I'm a 40-something former Canadian... Neil Young was part of my growing up, but a not a big part... colleague at work loaned my SHAKEY, and the obsession began... This is a fascinating read. Full of interesting historical anecdotes of the time. Neil's parents are very interesting aspects of media history in Canada (http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-74-1728-11881-11/that_was_then/people/scott_young). I learned more about the man that I probably ever wanted to know. But I listen to his music now more that ever. Tonight's the night..."
2,"Shaken, not Still-ed","First, I'll say it was a comparatively faster read for me. For what that's worth. And my wife pointed out how many times I was laughin' while reading the book.Hey, I would agree with the other reviews that Jimmy put himself too much into the story and the book burned out 'bout half way through. Probably the only way the guy could write the 90's section. I'm willing to give him the benefit.Now, Neil has gotta be one of the harder bio's for any author to get his teeth into. Lucky he had LOTS of long toothed rockers and ""in his orbit"" guys to get copy out of.I think he tossed some enjoyable CSNY stories in there.Would I recommend it? I'd rather steer a reader to Robert Gordon writing about Memphis musical legends like Alex Chilton.I think I just get a kick outta reading bio's like this, 'cuz all Neil's music is in my head and the book envokes a kind of jukebox reverie. Hey, if that is what ""Fan Jimmy"" was working towards, it worked for me!"
1,Author is a headcase,"Save your money. Too bad Neil Young allowed this creep to interview him for this piece of junk. Jimmy McDonough is the literary equivalant of Mark Chapman, Lennon's assasin. The last thing anyone wants is a sugar-coated book, but this takes the (sugarless) cake. Neil may or may not have some strange ways, but its the author's obvious hangups that come through clearest in this book."
1,Sour Grapes,"The author clearly does not like Neil Young.After 700 pages, he comes to the conclusion that, although he doesn't understand Neil, Neil is in fact a human being.What an insight, genius.This book stinks. It's poorly written and banal. Never mind the hero worship, this book is a hatchet job. Right down to mocking Neil Young's accent with the never ending ""heh heh heh"" the author keeps adding to every Neil quote. What an embarassment."
3,"Comprehensive, but rambling","While I can't fault the book for a lack of content, at times the sprawling, rambling nature of the prose doesn't equate to the lovely sprawling nature of the work it examines, like Down by the River or Cowgirl in the Sand..."
5,Shakey may be the title but it isn't,"It has been so neat to revisit my earlier years and pull out my old albums and listen to the songs as the book talks about them. I have gone on you tube and looked some up as well and found others recording versions of Neil's work. I love it. I'm young again!Joanne Lyons, author ofIt's About Time!: It's All About Time ...Time, Love, And Tenderness (Volume 1)"
2,biographer's disease....,"...is a condition where a biographer thinks writing about a genius makes said biographer a genius too.'Shakey' has lots of interesting, original interviews with Young. But overall it seemed McDonough wanted to take a big whiff of Neil Young's armpits and then tell him why they smelled bad."
5,Great Read,"I'm a big time Neil Young fan. I greatly enjoyed this book. Not pretending to be knowedgable on the life and times of Neil Young, I have a much fuller appreciation for him as a person and for his music."
1,Skip this one!,"I hated this book -- it was poorly written, unevenly detailed, presented the author's opinions as fact, and was continually critical of both Neil Young as a person and of his music. I got through all 740+ pages, despite feeling increasingly disappointed and annoyed, and found it to have no redeeming qualities. While I'm sure many of the book's criticisms about Neil Young as a personare accurate, the disection of Neil's music was incredible harsh and degrades some of his best work. In the end, I came away wondering why would motivate someone to spend 6 years on a book about a subject he clearly doesn't even like."
3,some interesting characters but no perspective at all,"McDonough long ago succumbed to rollingstonese, journalism without perspective. Or sometimes just lousy journalism, as in his account of Frank Sampedro, the silliest whitewash I've read in a long time. And, of course, there's the slavish worship of Kurt Cobain, whose great suicide means...what? The importance of rock'n'roll? By ignoring the historical context, McDonough's written hundreds of pages of gossip. The best parts of the book are the descriptions of some of Young's strange fellow travelers such as David Briggs and Jack Nitzsche. Young's a tough subject because his best songs are not big political statements. But he didn't write in a vacuum, either, and McDonough makes no effort to put him in any wider context other than rock journalism cliches. I'm not surprised Young cooled to the project, and I don't think it has anything to do with an unflattering portrait."
2,Boring,"Had to quit after 100 pages or so... not enough information about Neil, the author talks about everything but Neil. Needs more editing."
2,Go to the library,I am still waiting for the authoratative Neil Young biography.This is a quick skim at best. Skip past all the literal translations of Neil interviews and fawning from a lifelong fan for small bits of info. Huge Neil fan still waiting for archives and good biography.....Innnaresting????
1,Flawed but interesting nonetheless,"This is McDonough's first major publication and it shows. The book meanders here, there and everywhere but never quite finds it target. Hardcore Neil Young fans will love its wealth of information, but more casual fans will wish that the editor[s] had done their job. Despite nearly 800 pages of text, the author never really seems to understand Young and many of the stories are but endless variations on the same themes.As rock music biographies go, its not bad )this is not a genre known for good writing) but unless you are fascinated by those around Neil Young (about whom the book more revealing than about Young), boredom will set in early."
2,A Man Needs an Editor...,"I have been thinking about getting this book for awhile and finally picked it up after hearing a radio interview with the author. I haven't yet finished the book, but I must say it's really getting on my nerves. Information is constantly, annoyingly repeated. First McDonough states it himself, then he quotes Neil Young on the same topic. I prefer to see the author leave him/herself out of the book as much as possible. My ideal of a rock bio style is Tony Fletchers ""Moon"" about the life of Keith Moon."
1,Save your money and buy a copy of Tonights the Night instead,"Ugghhh. 700 pages of jealous, uninsightful blah blah blah.After 700 pages, McDonough comes to the conclusion that Neil is a ""Human Being."" Wow! What did you think he was, Jimmy? Well, from reading the book, I would say that Jimmy thought Neil was a monster. The author should go back to Tiger Beat magazine and start writing about n'sync."
4,Mcdonough almost hits the mark,"James Mcdonough has done a great job of research that any Neil Young fan will appreciate. From his childhood up until the early nineties, Mr. Young's musical influences and significant others are covered in great detail. Mr. Mcdonough is occasionally self-aggrandizing, quoting Mr. Young as addressing him as ""Jimmy"" and treating him as an old friend. This seems odd given Mcdonough's fixtation on the negative side of Neil Young's personality. If you read this book, you will understand why Neil Young, more than any artist of the 60s, is a survivor and why his creative juices still flow."
1,Wish I had my life back,"Just finished reading this book. Very disappointed. First part of book about Neil's early live was somewhat interesting but rest of it was boring. I have always been a Neil Young fan but probably not as much after I read this book. Neil treats people very shabby, walking out on any number of people without a word, including CSN a number of times."
1,Jimmy what?,"I trudged through this book and actually threw in down several times. Apparently Jimmy thinks ONLY Neil Young did rock and roll in the 70s. How would he know, he was just a child. He spends to much time trashing bands he knows nothing about. Finally when he called Sammy Haggar a 'goon' I got peed. Hey Jimmy, ever here of Montrose? Or Foghat or anyone else with a solid backbeat? Ever see Stempenwolf live at night for free in a Grant's parking lot? Ever see Hendrix booed like I did in Tampa 1968?He states several times that Neil does not listen to other bands. Apparently he does not either, at least not to any degree. And though published in 2002, he does not mention Live at Red Rock. Why? This book is all about Jimmy not Neil Young. Biographers who do not distance themselves to be objective always fail as this book does. I intend to loan it out to some one who has had one of my other bios for 6 years. IE, good riddance Jimmy."
1,I can't believe I read the whole thing!,I have to be one of the biggest Neil Young fans but this book stinks. Not only is the content poor but the writing is horrible. McDonough seems to pride himself on being one of Young's cronies. I didn't buy the book to learn about McDoughs relationship with Neil. I'm not surprised that Neil sued McDonough to not release this book at one point. The man is a legend that doesn't let out much of his music or much about his personal life. Too bad McDonough didn't take this opportunity and really put out a good archive. I'm in agreement with some of the other reviews in that whoever edited this book should be fired. A horrible disservice to a real legend.
3,Interesting But Flawed,"I echo what other reviewers have said. The author obviously had the benefit of many hours of interviews with Young, but better editing of sometimes rambling conversations would have produced a better product. Biographies of still living and still active people are necessarily incomplete, but the author abruptly stops his story in 1998 without even a paragraph of summary. As others point out, he DEFINITELY inserts himself into the story too much - this is supposed to be a bio of Neil Young, not Neil Young and Jimmy McDonough."
2,"Fittingly, a Mess","I agree with the readers who have noted that there is probably a very good 300-page book here; there is no question that the book is self-indulgently long and McDonough self-importantantly annoying. But in some ways this is a very fitting biography for Neil Young; although -- like his career -- it rambles and is filled with plenty of dross, when you get to the good stuff it's pretty darn good. Due to the high dross-to-good ratio, I'd recommend this for fans only. One final curious note: this book was repetitive enough, and frustrating enough, that at times it made me like the music less (not because of the artist's ""flaws,"" the main one of which, we are told (hundreds of times) is that he tends to do whatever he wants). Neil Young is worth of a biography that inspires interest, not distaste. It's too bad McDonough, unquestionably a fan, couldn't achieve that result."
4,The Review of Mr. Campion,"I appreciate the Campion Mysteries. They are well written books that have great casts of charactors and have wonderful plots. I have also seen the Campion Mysteries on televsion when it was shown on the public chanel. I like how determined the charactor of Mr. Campion is when he is solving mysteries, but he is always the gentleman and never forgets his manners. I find the idea of Mr. Campion having a friend, sidekick and butler named Lug amusing. Lug used to be a thief until Mr. Campion aided in his capture and they became friends. I have a hard time setting the books down when I get started. I recommend the Campion books for anyone who likes mysteries."
3,Might as well have been water.,"My cat was not impressed, and had no reaction at all. Very disappointing, I wanted her to enjoy the spray on her toys."
3,This is ok..,"This is cute, but there is nothing educational about it so I don't see why they ask us to rate it's educational value. There is only so much fun a child can have with it. I brought it for my niece who likes pocketbooks & puppies, I haven't given it to her yet. I think it is very tiny."
5,this is the same version I saw on HBO in 1979,this guy goes on about the 131 minute version I saved all my old HBO guides from the late 70's early 80's the driver premiered on HBO on August 31st 1979 and it was listed at 91 minutes which is the same as the DVD version so that was the same. where did this 131 minute version come from ???????
1,I'll wait for full length version!,Would you leave songs off of a classic album remastering? Why leave over a half hour off of this? MORONS
4,The Driver,Very unusual production and story ....great chase scenes and an abstraction of identities. The car scenes are the best and the acting is understated but effective.
3,Slow Ride,"The basic premise of ""The Driver"" reminded me alot of ""Heat"" where a stoic master criminal faces off against a passionately determined cop. The similarities end there. That's not to say that Bruce Dern's energetic cop was not an engaging character but there is no discernible chemistry between himself and Ryan O'Neal's taciturn driver. Dern may as well be acting with a crash test dummy. The only time that O'Neal seems to be really engaged here is in the film's car chase scenes. Another irritant was the film's characters don't have real names(i.e ""the Driver"", ""the Detective"", ""the Player"", etc.). Director-screenwriter Walter Hill may think this is profound but it smacks more to me as pretentious. The film can be recommended solely for it's car chase sequences as opposed to it's middling story."
2,"One of the Worst Movies, Ever -","Boring, implausible, dominated by chase scenes written for teenagers, double-crosses, meaningless shootings. Easy to see why Ryan O'Neal and Bruce Dern are no longer employed as movie actors."
3,Entertaining little chase movie,The Driver is a good cops and robbers film with Ryan O'neil and Bruce Dern ( in a good performance ) going head to head in a battle of wits. Great chase sequences and a distinct 70's feel add up to make a good time.
5,Give It Up! Give It Up!,"Very original! ....I'm a rapper myself and it's nice to hear someone coming in at a little different angle in terms of rap-style and execution. You wont be able to stop bumpin' even after the music stops! ...You'll want to hear it over and over....With the right marketing and promotion and if Ramsey continues to produce of this pro-quality, I guarantee without a doubt that Ramsey will become a well known artist that everyone from this genre will want to imitate. He definitely has the potential to set a new standard....."
5,Great hairdryer,"I had this hairdryer prior to this purchase (although in a different color), and I loved it. It started making a strange noise last month; I'd had it about two years by then. I was happy to get the exact same one again. I wasn't looking for a fancy hair dryer, just one with two settings (high and low) and enough power to get the job done. This one has good strength and it's compact enough to fit into my small bathroom drawer. I don't usually use the cord keeper feature, but it works well and doesn't seem flimsy or shoddy. This is a great hair dryer to pack in luggage because the cord retracts and the whole thing folds, so it's easy to shove in a corner. Overall, great product!"
3,Okay for a portable hair dryer,"First off, this is pretty big for a portable hair dryer. Second, this baby is loud. Especially since this is used for your hair, you'll be holding it pretty close to your ears. And third, I don't about all the reviews saying this dryer doesn't get hot enough. The controls let you choose from warm and hot. Mine gets plenty hot when I put it to hot. But it's not good for you hair to use hot anyway, so stick with the warm. I wish there was a setting for cool, because my thumb gets really tired after holding the ""Cool"" button down for a while. But if you're looking for a portable hair dryer that works and does what it's supposed to, this can be an acceptable one."
1,HORRIBLE,"Basically, this dryer has three temperatures: COLD, COOL, AND WARM. This dryer only warms up (barely)if used in the ultra-loud, fast speed. If used in the lower speed, it barely warms up to room temperature. It's no better than the wind blowing thru my hair!If I wanted the wind to dry my hair, I would have bought a sports car! I need my hair dryer to get HOT!"
1,Started on Fire!!,"DON'T but this hairdryer. I had mine for about a month when the retractable cord broke, button, spring and all... and then this afternoon I was drying my hair when it suddenly turned off and fire shot out of the cord and melted the plastic coating and started smoking. It was EXTREMELY startling and a huge hazard. Now I am sitting here with wet hair and looking up similar stories ... Please dont buy this product!"
3,great until it stopped working after 4 months,Loved the lightweight and compactible dryer until stopped working about 4 months after purchase date. It would stop in the middle of drying my hair and then go on and off every few seconds. Very annoying. I will not buy another.
1,not that great,"I bought this dryer to replace my 10 year old conair, when it gets hot it would stop. Good thing I didn't throw it away. This cordkeeper only worked for about 4 months. It is also very LOUD! ALmost hurt my ears to use it"
2,Fire!!!!,"I have used three of these. The first two each lasted a year before shorting out. I kept buying them because I liked the cordkeeper function. This last one, though, shorted out and started a fire. I have notified the company and will see what happens. But I doubt that I will purchase another. It's obvious that this product has an engineering or manufacturing flaw and should be pulled off the market."
2,Sure would be nice to get a quality hair dryer for the wife.,"It was great out of the box. Nice strong dryer. It actually still does dry nicely. But, now the cord doesn't wind up. and it has two broken buttons. It only can be put on and dry. It only gets used by my wife once a week or so. Can't change the drying power level. Of course we have it on the high level. A product with good ideas, but made poorly. I hate to say it, another product made in a foreign country that is made with inferior materials."
2,Not good,"I was really suprised with the poor quality of this hair dryer. Over the past many years, I have used the Conair brand. After just a few uses, the retractable cord stopped retracting and the COOL air button no longer popped back up, so I all I was able to do was dry my hair with cool air. Once I folded it up, a plastic part in the dryer broke and a spring fell out as well. I purchased a cheaper non folding, non retractable cord dryer and it works better than this more expensive model. Save your cash and do not buy this."
1,Won't stay in locked position after 6 months,"Like many out there, my last Conair dryer lasted nearly 20 years. This new Conair was very good for the first 6 months but now it only wants to remain in the convenient fold down/storage position. It's like someone broke it's little red neck."
1,Absolutely terrible,"I really hate this hair dryer. Absolutely every single time I use it, it shorts out and won't turn back on for at least 10 minutes. You want to talk about stress? Try getting ready to run out the door and never knowing if your hair dryer will actually finish the job before it calls it quits. And, even if I've only used it for 1 minute, if I turn this dryer off, it won't turn on again for at least 10 minutes. How can a stupid hair dryer overheat in ONE MINUTE? If the phone rings or my husband calls, I have to let this thing keep running because I KNOW it won't turn back on.I hate this piece of junk and am online right now trying to buy something else to replace it!"
2,No fires... yet...,"Well, my hairdryer hasn't started any fires, but it also hasn't worked correctly since right after I bought it either. The retractable cord doesn't retract anymore. The button broke off that controls that and, in general, it just isn't a good quality hair dryer. Pieces of a hair dryer shouldn't just break off. I bought a ConAir product because they aren't too expensive and last a really long time, but now I'm thinking I should go ahead and spend over $75 for a hair dryer just so it doesn't fall apart."
2,powerful,Powerful hair dryer or maybe it seems like it is because my other one was on its way out for a while. Low temp isn't very warm and hair dryer is very loud. High temp is hot and powerful.
1,Too NOISY and not hot enough,"Just used one of these, now my ears are ringing! If you value your hearing, stay away from this model.Plus, its ""high"" temp is really ""medium"", compared to other hair dryers I've used. So it takes twice as long to dry your hair, all the while damaging your ear drums."
1,Not up to Conair's quality,"I bought this product Dec 8,2006, and it lasted till Aug 20, 2007. It's not worth the cost to ship back. It just stopped working. My last Conair hair dryer lasted some 15 or more years. Think I'll check out some other brands by checking out these great reviews on Amazon. Don't buy this hair dryer, you will be greatly disappointed."
3,It'll do.,"I have used this hairdryer for many years now, but they always seem to overheat. I LOVE the retractable cord so I just keep buying them. THey recently changed the style and added the ""Ionic"" part. The hairdryer is a bit heavier than the old version and the ""ionic"" stuff actually makes my hair a bit limper. I'm giving it a couple more months and will determine whether I like it more than 3 stars....."
1,Cord doesn't retract,"The first thing I did was pull out the cord to see if it retracted. Apparently the cord doesn't retract if you ""pull it out too far"" as I read later in the directions. If they make a hair dryer where you have to read the directions before using it, the company is doing it wrong. I didn't even bothering using it I was so angry."
5,Conair Ionic Conditioning 1875 Watt Cord-Keeper Hair Dryer with retractable cord,We have one already just like it and the wife loves it and that is why we bought another one.A Bargain.Our old one is 6 years old and we are ready for the new one.
3,Plug is too big.,You know the plug is just to big for most of the outlets. Hangs down too much and hits the counter tops. Good power though
1,nearly burned my house down!,"Do not buy this Hair dryer! Mine caught fire when it was plugged in but not turned on. If I had not been home it would have burned down my house! As it was, I smelled smoke and was able to put out the fire! Very scary ! I was lucky I did not get burned and nothing was damaged. I will never buy another Conair product again!C."
5,The best web book for web graphic desiner ever!!!,"I have spent lots of times to look for a book that is written for graphic designer who wants to design the web pages, I find out that some web design books are too complicate for the beginners and of course, some are to easy for the web masters. Only Peter Kentie's book I believe that is designed for both beginner and advanced web designers."
2,Dated...,"If you you know anything about webdesign, don't even think of buying this book. It can bore you to death, with its sometimes dated terminologies, and fascinations at technologies that are now dead. I don't recommend this book if you're interested in the process of web design or if you have the slightest experience. If you allready know some webdesign skills and are interested more in the process, ""Web Redesign, workflow that works""(kelly Goto & Emily Cotler) is the book for you. If You don't know web design and would like to start somewhere, Lynda weinman's ""Macromedia Dreamweaver MX Hands-On Training "" is a great place to start."
3,Just okay,"This product leaves your hair feeling soft and silky. That's great, but it doesn't really hold on fine hair even if there is just a light breeze outside. It does keep my hair in place if I'm only indoors. I think there are better or at least equivalent products for a better price that are available."
4,A good Punk album,"I first heard the Amputees on Tony Hawk's Underground and fell in love with the song ""She Said"". Soon after I heard the songs ""No Mercy"" and ""Want Dead"" which were also really awesome. I finally bought the album and overall it was a good album but it had some problems like all albums. If like the Descendents or The Distillers this is an album you should pick up. Or if you like any punk. You may want to here their new mp3s which sound more matured at http://www.theamputees.com/media.htm"
5,"The Whispers Greatest Slow Jams, Vol.2","Wow what a cd. The Whispers have out done themselves with this collection of music. Very sophisticated, tastefully done and what you would expect from a class act such as The Whispers."
4,Memories,"I remember when this show was on TV, I loved it and could hardly wait for the next episode to air. I was very disappointed when it was so short-lived. I bought the 1st season and (20+ years later)find my perspective has changed. This show focuses on the seamier side of human nature. Oh, there's no blood and gore--thank goodness!--but watching the depraved side of man thru one and two hour movies doesn't excite me. I enjoy Murder She Wrote, Charlie's Angels (the old shows), Simon and Simon and especially Scarecrow and Mrs. King! They are very similar but have a ""lighter"" tone to them. There are also fewer episodes, I believe only 8 compared to other TV shows where a season has 24 or more episodes. This series is absolutely well done, well acted and the quality of DVD's is great, it's just no longer one of my favorites."
5,finally released.....been waiting for this series to be released,I have really enjoyed this series. It ranks up there with Murder She Wrote and Diagnosis Murder. My VCR tapes are about worn out. This is a real good series and I hope they release them all. They are that good.
5,Father Dowling,I have been waiting years for Father Dowling to come on DVD. I hope that season 2 will also become available. The quality of the DVD was excellant.
4,Good But Not As Good As The Books,"As good as I remember the series, however, the quality of the DVDs in some places was lacking. All-in-all, okay."
2,"Cheesy, pleasant, and written by a horrible man","I watched this show as a kid, when I was a practicing Catholic. I was thinking of pre-ordering this, but quite frankly, I don't want the estate of the original author (Ralph MckInerny) to get any money. The man was a loud mouthed homophobe who loved to cram religion down other's throats. Go search it out. All the evils of the world are by women, Obama, and gay people, or by Catholics who try to take a more liberal stance on the world and the people in it. No separation of church and state from this guy."
5,Surprisingly clever and witty,"He's clever and she's witty. They make a perfect team in solving mysteries. He has the wisdom of Solomon and she's a jack of all trades. I like dvd's because you can ""commercial"" when you want but we seldom pause. It holds our interest until the end. Also with the captions my 91 year old hard of hearing mom can enjoy and that's so important."
4,Picture quality.,"I don't know if I was unlucky with my copy, but the picture quality is not up to standard, often somewhat blurred. Close-ups are okay, but generally this doesn't compare with other series I've bought from the same era.Having said that, the series itself is both humorous and thrilling."
5,Farewell To A Great Series And Author,"This was one of the great series of historical detective fiction. The author's writing style perfectly depicted late 18th Century England, and the mysteries themselves were always suspenseful, fun and perfectly plotted. While this one was not quite up to the earlier ones, and it really was evident that others were involved in the writing, it still merits 5 stars because it was truly a great end for characters who really began to seem like old friends. Even though the author wrote many other types of work, he will clearly live on in the readers' minds for this wonderful series."
4,Bruce Alexander's Final Novel,"I've been a fan of ""Sir John Fielding"" - the Blind Beak of London - and his biographer Jeremy, his ward, since I first read Alexander's ""Blind Justice.""Set in the late 18th Century, before war broke out between England and the American Colonies, Alexander not only gave me wonderfully entertaining mysteries, but painted the period and intrique of the political microcosm in London's justice system.When Alexander died (a pen name) last year, I felt I had lost a friend as well as an author I adored. Then a last manuscript was found and published, and though not as good as some of his other books, helped tie up some loose ends, gave some insight into Anton Mesmer, and gave me one final good read.I shall miss him and his writing."
2,Great series but this book disappoints,"The book starts off well enough despite being quite predictable, most readers could probably guess how the murder was committed within the first 30 pages or so. The second half of the book, however, is just sloppy. It's pretty clear that the two authors who finished the novel after Mr. Cook's death did not have nearly the same feel for the characters nor talent as Cook. It seemed slapped together in order to get it on the market and done with, very disappointing ending to an otherwise great series. If better writers were available to mimic the style of previous books I'd like to see more stories involving Jeremy and John Fielding but, sadly, I think this will be the end of it."
3,Good up to a point...,"I'm a big fan of this series and always wondered who was the real name behind the pen name. I was very sorry to hear of Bruce Alexander's (Cook's) passing. His wit and writing style were outstanding and unfortunately hard to duplicate. Bruce only completed part of this book before his death, so it was finished by his widow and author John Shannon. I completely disagree with the Publishers Weekly review that says it's ""impossible to tell where Alexander's words end and theirs begin."" It's like day and night to me; at the end of chapter 9 the fun is over and the last three chapters are a pale imitation.I agree with the other reviews that the solution was apparent from the start and there really was no puzzle to solve, but I would still recommend this book to true fans of Bruce's work just for the first nine chapters."
3,Rules of Engagement,"Why the reference to the Adams brothers? John and Samual Adams, who are linked in the minds of the reader as just two of the many men who challenged the British treatment of the Colonies, were second cousins. Samual was the firebrand and much more radical than John. Although communication was obviously much slower in that day, I simply cannot imagine a high ranking English politician being that misinformed. If that was the case, someone supply some references, please. This jarred so that I couldn't finish reading the book. It causes me to question how much else in this series might have been this badly researched/edited, but I accepted not knowing better."
3,Disappointed.,"I love Gregg Braden, but not so sure about this DVD. I had no idea that this was an old, possibly 1980's, recording. I was so distracted by the props and age of the recording I had a difficult time following what the subject-matter."
3,DVD defective,"THe DVD was defective so we could watch very little. What we did see looked very interesting, so it was frustrating not to be able to see the whole thing."
4,Science meets Spirituality,"Loved this. Gregg Braden makes sense of science in a really easy to understand way. He uses his ability to spot patterns in history, science, religious history, anything really and puts them together to show how they support each other as part of a bigger whole.For so long spirituality has been stuck in a world of pure faith, unprovable and often ridiculed for being factless. Now is the time that the facts are starting to come together to prove there is something in it all.Gregg's manner is engaging and interesting. He makes light work of these heavy subjects such as quantum physics and religion and presents it in a meaningful and powerful way.Even the most skeptical can't deny factual evidence. It's heartening to think where we are going as a society. I look forward to what we're heading for. His other book around 2012 is an extension of this and equally captivating."
5,"good science, wide vision","Greg Braden combines wideness of vision with the science to back it up. He has a clear way of talking that is easy to listen to and has fascinating things to say about how what we feel are miracles are often just the way things work. At various periods of history our world view has been shaken by a new way of looking at the world, as when we found that the sun didn't revolve around us. This is another such time. His visuals are good and illustrative without being distracting. I highly recommend it."
5,True way of prayer!,"I love this DVD --- Gregg Braden is a powerful source of knowledge, research, and cutting edge thought that opens minds, releases resistance, awakens probability! He is genuine and compassionate in his delivery and it is very thought provoking for using the tool of prayer in Divine Use. His facts and studies can awaken or shed light on possibility that even the most skeptic of thinkers will ponder on the possibility."
5,Fitness rings,"Pilates is so much better when utilizing the ring. The ring forces you to engage the abs and perform the exercises correctly. As with all of the Stott videos, this one is excellent."
2,You get what you pay for ...,"This is a re-tread of Canon's APS 55-200 lens. It complements the 18-55 that comes with the Digital Rebel, but doesn't really have much else going for it. So-so image quality, and cheap plastic/poor quality construction. In general, a wobbly lens is NOT a good thing!If you're looking for something in this price range, I would recommend the 28-105 f/3.5-4.5 USM. For about the same money, you get ring USM, better image quality, and solid construction.If really need the longer focal length, spend the extra money for a 75-300 f/4-5.6 IS USM which has image stabilization and comparable image and build quality to the 28-105. Or invest in a 70-200 f/4 L, which while pricey, is a vastly superior lens that will last a lifetime, and hold its resale value."
2,Getaway...from this CD!,"I am a fan of Corey Stevens, and currently own all three of his releases. I truly enjoyed Blue Drops of Rain, and Road To Zen wasn't too bad either. However, Getaway was rather disappointing to me. Corey has veered away from his Blues style with this CD, and does not showcase his guitar talents. I think that the lyrics were rather boring and unmoving, and I lost interest in this album's sound. However, I think that he has improved upon his vocals. With the exception of one song...""Twilight Zone"", I think this album needs to Getaway from your CD collection."
2,Abandoning the Blues,"Corey's first release ""Blue Drops Of Rain"" was a great blues record no matter if he sounded like SRV. He could have done worse and he did by abandoning the blues with his next two records. This one is basically a weak poprock record with a few twists that keep you listening for a while but then the novelty wears off. Please Corey, go back to doing what you do best, the blues."
2,Is that all?,"After getting through the heavy Stevie-Ray, and Clapton sounds of ""Blue Drops..."", I thought Corey found his own voice on ""Road to Zen"". This is a 180 away from that. It's not bad music, although a little thin, it's just non-descript. Instead of relying on Corey's guitar prowess and vocal power, this album tries to cover bored and thin songs with heavy production. Too bad, I really like this guy."
1,Yuck,"Yuck. Unfortnately that aboutsums it up for me. I don'tthink they should sell this out of the blues section of aCD store since there are no blues on it. I usually likeblues based rock but not thisstuff. I play blues guitar inclubs and I wouldn't want topromote myself with music thatsounds like this. Sorry Corey,I liked the first CD."
1,Piano by Candlelight,Was not what I wanted at all. The picture lookes just like the CD I was tryiing to replace but it turned out not to be what I was looking for.
3,Great Songs and Bonus Features.,"This was the single release for her Behind the Eyes CD and has the 2 best songs off that album on it ""Takes a Little Time"" and Somewhere Down the Road"" and she redoes her version of Michael Card's ""El Shaddai."". Also has some great bonus features videos of behind the scenes footages. This is a great single album and worth the price if you can find it. Like I said it contains the 2 best songs off the Behind the eyes album and really the only reason for buying the album unless you are a huge fan of Amy Grant. A great collectors item for fans."
4,Only one caveat about this set,"I agree with everything that has been said about this show, and only wanted to point out that all but one episode are in black and white. ADDITION TO ORIGINAL REVIEW: Well, I saw the color episode and it's spoiled watching the other B/W episodes. The problem is, when you film in B/W, you know you need to show contrast. In color, you can use a more subtle palette, such as varying shades of blue in the same outfit. When you watch this in B/W, everything is a shade of gray. Very disappointed, wish they were all in B/W so I wouldn't know what I was missing."
4,Lost classic,"This is a lost gem for fans of Sci-fi from across the pond. Doctor Who fans should check this show out. The kids are great and the concepts and science are amazing. They tackle global warming, destruction of rain forest and even cloning. While the sets are cheap looking, as is in step with all BBC productions at this time, the vision and scope of ideas was refreshing. So check them out as the travel forwards and backwards in time thru a rift in the fabric of Time."
3,Grammar Hammar drops,This is an excellent book for those who want to review the basics or for teachers who need another resource.
3,Must We Be Hammered?,"If you're looking for grammar guidance, this is as fine an attempt as any grade school English textbook. If you're looking for help that won't put you to sleep, try ""Eats, Shoots, and Leaves"" This one's a bit dry."
1,Worst military game ever,"I have played so many military, espionnage, anti-terrorists games and this one is the worst of them all. I don't know how Boomer, Jester and Spectre passed the SEALs' BUDs. These guys are strategically and tactically the most stupidest SEALs I have ever seen. They cannot think by themselves nor fight like a SEAL. This game is only good for the online gaming but no good at all for playing the missions solo."
4,I like them both,"So I go out and rent SOCOM 2,I liked it alot.It had awesome levels,great guns{Mark 23 SD,M4,,M60,Shotgun,and more},and was so fun.Like a month later,my friend comes over with SOCOM,it looked the same.I mean,awesome levels,great guns{Mark 23 SD,M4,M16,M60,and more},and was so fun.I would buy them both if I were you."
3,Socom is Fun,"Fun for Die Hard Military Gamers. Slow game play controls but once you get the hang of it, the missions are fun."
2,The Bad Reveiw By Sage H.,"The game ""SOCOM U.S. Navy Seals (No Headset) is a terrible game to play. Its impossible to beat. Even the best gamer couldn't beat it, its that hard to play. You can't even beat the 1st level unless you have a spell on you. Which can't even be ture."
1,the best army game ever,this game simulates what it might feel like to reallt be in the army and fight against alott of other nations!!!!!Buy this game now
1,This is NOT a suppressor!!!,"This is not a surge suppressor nor does it provide ""clean power"". It is a basic surge PROTECTOR as the package says. This means that only if the voltage goes above a certain number will the protector kick in and pull your electronics off the circuit. As far as a basic surge protector goes, this one doesn't seem too bad. Just know that it only a protector and does nothing to regulate or condition your voltage."
5,don't skip on your surge suppressors,"you spend lots of money for your electronic equipment and get cheap on this. it not only protects but is an insurance policy if something goes wrong. i own one of these and bought 2 more because i learned how important EMI/RFI filtering is and other don't seam to offer this unless you pay much higher. what should you look for in a surge suppressor, 1. 2800 joules should be the minimum for your computer and av equipment, 2. EMI/RFI filtering on all lines, 3. coaxial/phone/Ethernet input/output all filtered and protected, 4. special transformer spaced plugs, 5. long power cord with flat wall plug. this has it all and unlike the person who had 2 defective plugs hope no one ever has that problem but it's nice to hear they stand behind their warranty."
3,"Fascinating read, but over-editorialized","Silverstein does a decent job of relaying a fascinating story; the book is a quick read and moves along smoothly. There are three down-sides to the book:1) His anti-nuclear biases are blatant enough to make one question the integrity of his reporting; his editorializing is tedious and simple-minded.2) When one takes a step back and analyzes the story, much of it appears quite over-blown, which I suspect is the real reason it did not get much press attention when it occurred (without giving away the story, i will say that the conclusion is long on hypothetical, somewhat hysterical hyperbole and short on actual nefarious consequences).3) His characterization of the boy and his family is jaundiced and needlessly judgmental; it is clear that the author has only a cursory understanding of the struggles and limitations many individuals face."
1,"Where is Golf Manor, MI?????","I'm from suburban Detroit and had never heard of this story. (Maybe we were on vacation at the time.) I was not aware of it until a review of the book in DISCOVER this month. And I cannot find any place called ""Golf Manor, MI"". Is this a pseudonym? I'd like to know the name of the real city in which it happened. Mapquest shows the only cities by this name as being in Ohio and New Jersey. What is going on?"
3,Not related to Boy Scouts,"I really liked the story. Unfortunately, the author seemed very biased against the Boy Scouts. Linking the boy's activities to scouting activities was REALLY a stretch. Similarly, the author seems confused by the senior patrol leader position, camp position and Eagle projects...this leads me to wonder how accurate the rest of the information is..."
2,Scout Leader and Nuclear Industry employee,"What a wonderful story told badly! I heard about this book and thought it would be a good story to share with my Scouts and coworkers. Silverstein is (1) a poor writer, (2) obviously biased and (3) did not to do any research on the truth about nuclear technology. The end of the book was moralistic and squishy at best.This story is interesting and can be both inspiring and cautionary at the same time. That was not conveyed well."
4,A tale both humerous and sad.,"This book bears the style that has become popular in the past decade of alternating between chapters telling the main story and chapters setting forth the background of the overall subject matter a la ""The Perfect Storm"" and ""Into the Wild"". I enjoy that style as it is like reading two books at once. Others might not like it. In this case, beware of the obvious anti-nuke tilt of hte author. I was almost amused by it but have read Amazon reviews by those put off by it.I was amused by the drive of the protagonist as well as the ignorance of all around him. I was saddened at learning where the boy who loved chemistry and nuclear science ended up."
2,Perhaps a good magazine article...,"The central story of ""The Radioactive Boy Scout"" would make for an interesting short story, but is too thin to have been turned in to a novel.The historical background and mildly informative padding would not be so bad if weren't for the authors strong anti-nuclear power bias. Every incident was a ""disaster"" and every ""nightmare"" was ""hushed up.""I cannot recommend this book."
1,Blatant editorializing and content padding.,"Unfortunately, Mr. Silverstein has taken what would otherwise be an interesting little pamphlet about a teenager's activities gone seriously awry, and padded it out to booklet length with blatant negative editorializing, over sensationalism and mediocre writing. If the anti-nuclear, anti-Scout and amateur observations pertaining to the anti-nuclear family (pun intended) are extracted and thoughtfully edited, perhaps a chapter or two of ""on topic"" content remain.The potential for several good, and worthwhile, stories are certainly present in this booklet. Developing those stories will also certainly require the talents of a more focused, less biased and better writer.It is not likely that I will again be fooled into purchasing a booklet by Mr. Silverstein."
3,Entertaining read,"I read this book through in two sittings. It was a fun and interesting read about a very unusual character and a very serious problem. The background information concerning the nuclear power industry was useful and helped fill in the context of the times and underline the seriousness of the danger. I didn't see the information concerning the safety and cost record of the nuclear industry as being political, unless recounting these issues, that are a matter of record, is now considered a political act."
4,Works like it should,This Auto Meter Sport Comp Boost gauge works like advertised. Matches my EGT gauge perfectly.
4,Great illustrations,"The illustrations and subjects covered are wonderful. There are illustrations of a naked man and woman that are non-sexual, but they caused quite a stir with my 6 year old. I would only recommend for mature children."
4,Not the correct handles,"Even though the product is great-I didn't recieve the correct handles that are pictured, Instead I recieved the other choice which was the crystal knobs,I wanted the metal handles."
5,wooden teether,A great non-plastic teether for your little one. It makes a great clapping noise when it's shaken - this delighted my little guy. He gummed it daily and it held up. He no longer uses it as a teether but he does still go back to it and play with it - using it as a noise maker.Great quality!
5,PLEASANTLY PLEASED!!,THIS TOY IS A WONDERFUL ALTERNATIVE TO TOXIC CHEAPLY MADE PLASTIC TOYS. IT IS COMFORTING ESPECIALLY DURING TEETHING TO KNOW THAT OUR CHILD IS NOT CHEWING ON SOMETHING THAT CAN MAKE HIM POSSIBLY ILL. THE HABA SMALL TOY LINE IS REASONABLY PRICED AS WELL. FLAPSI MAKES A SMALL RATTLING NOISE WHEN SHAKEN AS THE WOOD PIECES HIT TOGETHER. OUR SON LIKES THE BRIGHT COLORS!!
3,"Greatly loved, but cracked","This toy was a favorite of my son from the moment we gave it to him when he was 6 months. He loved to chew on the head and the tail, hold on to it and shake it. It made a nice sound when moved which my son seemed to enjoy. It is small, but it was perfect for his little hands and encouraged him to grasp it and practice moving it from hand to hand.Sadly its head cracked after a couple of months of use and it was no longer safe for my son to play with as I feared it would fall apart and present a chocking hazard. My son's drooling and chewing on the head likely have caused the crack, but a toy designed for babies should be made to withstand such a treatment.Thankfully, Amazon allowed me to return the item as defective even though it was more than 30 days after I purchased it and was obviously used. If it was not for the cracking, I'm sure my son would have played with it for several more months as he loved flapsi while he had him."
2,Mucha do about very little,Interesting for a day or two - my son was fascinated the first time he saw it and less interested every day on
3,Mischief,"I liked the movie very much.... i had it years ago on VHS and thought I' d to have it on dvd, Since the movie was made only approx. 40 miles from my home in Nelsonville Ohio, I wanted friends to see it. And relate to it.I enjoyed the movie very much"
2,WAITING FOR THE DVD VERSION!!!,One of the funniest and entertaining teeny bop movies of the mid 80's. Up there with Fast Times and Porky's. Kelly Preston...that sweet body of hers....FUGEDABOUTIT!!!!!
5,awrsome movie,one of the funniest movies ever with a story line great plot great acting. this movie will always be a classic
5,More than eye candy,"I was totally impressed with the soundtrack throughout the whole movie. The song selections, choosen from that era, were beautifully choreographed for the situations, both funny and romantic. The acting was decent, the setting fantastic, and the transformation from an innocent, naive boy to one who wises up in the end was superbly done. I enjoyed this more than ""American Graffiti"", because it seemed more authentic from that time period, and the music choosen was simply perfect throughout."
2,The guys can't act,"I'm not a professional critic or one that watches many movies. I just love 80's movies and since this movie had good reviews, I had to watch it. I was so dissapointed with the nerd and the rebel's bad acting in the movie; It was just horrible! I like the storyline and the soundtrack, but the acting really ruined everything. If you just want to watch it to see some skin and not for good quality acting, then this is your movie."
4,"Kelly Preston, nuff said...","If you were around in the 80's & know who Kelly Preston is, then you've more than likely already seen this movie. It's a romantic comedy about how the clumsy, no common sense or game having school geek tries to get with the school beauty queen with a little help from the school James Dean that is. Kelly Preston plays the alpha woman, you know the one that sparkles walking down the hall in High School, all the guys want her, all the other females want to be her, sex with her will add years to your life. There's one in every High School. I'm sure most of you have seen this storyline before in other movies so you already know how it turns out. Doug McKeon plays Preston's pursuer, the clumsy sex starved geek & I must say he doe's a very convincing job of it, so much to the point of where it gets annoying, to me anyways thats why I didn't give the movie 5 stars. Jamie Gertz plays a pretty good supporting role in this flick."
3,Not a bad Comedy,"This film is not bad but with a typical storeyline and similar to others, but worth a look."
5,mischief!! one word DVD!!,great fun where is the dvd for peets sake??? cmon already.. this is a cult classic...
5,Movie,When I received this movie it was in very good condition. The case was not damaged at all and the movie played very well.
4,Question,"Great Flick, was there ever a Soundtrack for this??? If there never was they missed the boat."
4,Coming of age movie has charm,"A slice of the 50's filmed in Nelsonville, Ohio, which hadn't changed much when I went to college there in the mid-70's but has changed a lot since. Kelly Preston has a beautiful (and funny) nude scene which will make you reach for the remote."
4,Porky's with a touch of class,"Mischief is an overlooked little gem of a movie that is basically a teen comedy with just the right touch of melodrama.Not having come of age during that time I can't say how realistic it is but I could definately relate to the inexperience coupled with the raging hormones of my teen years.Almost as good as another teen comedy classic Dazed and Cofused,Mischief benefits from a generous 50's soundtrack as well."
4,re-imagining our past,"Thompson is so dazzling a writer that, even when you don't agree with some of his conclusions, you are nevertheless thrilled to be taken along for this intellectual joyride through prehistory and myth; half the fun is the argument that this book will most assuredly start. New Age mystic or not, Thompson will forever change the way you perceive your world in challenging many things you have previously taken for granted: patriarchy, sexuality, gender and identity, and religion. Literate, passionate, and eccentric--this is one of my favorite books."
3,A bit outdated but makes for some fascinating reading,"The topic was most interesting in the early 80's when Joseph Campbel's popularity was cresting and there was a renewed interest in Grave's ""white godess"". Yet, as another reviewer points out, selective citations marr an otherwise fascinating prose.Makes for some very stimulating (albeit imbalanced) reading."
1,Silly,"Some interesting ideas about mythology, and some fine writing, are ruined by sloppy scholarship, wishful thinking, and general nonsense. The author either can't understand, or misrepresents, basic scientific thinking as well as Julian Jaynes, Noam Chomsky, Richard Leakey, and Charles Darwin. Thompson is obviously sharp enough to understand his primary sources -- and I'm afraid that he selectively quotes things out of context as well as setting up straw man fallacies. Meanwhile Thompson treats Edgar Cayce's past-life experience claims seriously. This book was highly reccomended and I was annoyed to find that it was new age hooey. For works on the psychology, sociology and history of myths stick to Cambell and Frazier"
1,American double-standard & hypocrisy waste of paper,"Americans as usual blame everybody else but themselves (CIA) and their Euro stooges such as Germans and Vatican, the biggest perpetrators of the YU collapse. Zimmerman is a totally biased ex-ground operative in Belgrade therefore should not be trusted."
2,Really Needs Links For Footnotes,"I totally agree with D. Arnold, the footnotes being in line are very troublesome in reading and thinking through the statements being addressed. I have completed the introductory material and about to begin the ""Discipleship"" itself.I am looking forward to the reading, but would greatly appreciate and up date on the footnotes location and the possibility of an active link from to the footnote itself to the footnote material. The link to a footnote, and the footnote itself should not interrupt the actual reading of the text.You need to be able to go from the footnote to the text of the footnote and return to the location of the link in the book. Other than this very akward reading of footnotes I'd rate this book thus far a ""five star"". However, because of the awkarwness of the footnotes and the lack of needed links I'm rating it with ""two stars"". I paid a ""lot"" less for much better structured (links) books."
3,Discipleship,I could not stay interested in this book. I guess it is the style it's written in. Put it up after a few chapters.
3,Kindle Version Needs Work,"I read the earlier incarnation _The Cost of Discipleship_ years ago and am looking forward to reading the new translation, especially now that I have a better theological understanding of the issues. The introduction alone is a worthwhile read for those looking for a brief overview of Bonhoeffer's thought.However, the Kindle edition needs work. Footnotes are in-line in the text instead of marked with links. The publisher needs to work on this as it is a tremendous distraction while reading."
5,Inspiring,Dietrich Bonhoeffer leaves no question unanswered in his very hard to put down book. The fact that he lived this out in real life just makes it more real.
3,Matches jacket,"Good hood, matches my jacket. Lies relatively flat. Snaps on. Needs some tweaking. Dumb Velcro chin strap can cut into your chin. Folds out of the way but could be better. Also could use a drawstring and toggles around the hood opening otherwise I would have gave it a better rating. Seller was great."
1,"Doesn't fit, isn't right product","I did a search for a 27910 replacement battery, read the reviews, and bought this one.Turns out it's not a 27910 battery, doesn't even come close to fitting in my phone, and now i have to decide whether it's worth $5.75 to deal with returning it (probably not). Especially since this means finding a local store to buy the replacement i actually need.I'm very unhappy with the misrepresentation."
5,Just what I needed,Our Motorola MA303 cordless phone battery was not holding a charge. This replacement battery was just what we needed. It charged overnight and holds a charge just like the old one used to.
1,Wrong size,I made sure that the numbers on my battery matched the number listed and when I received the item it was the wrong size.
1,Horrible customer service and wrong product,"I ordered three batteries ...I changed the order when it was confirmed by e-mail that the wrong batteries were being sent ...I never heard from anyone at e- batteries to confirm the change..the wrong batteries were apparently sent according to customer service....I contacted them twice by e-mail to find out what was going on with no reply received ....I posted a negative review, then I was contacted and told I should have received the ""wrong"" batteries by now. I confirmed I had recieved no batteries at all, I did not hear back from them .....I never did receive any battereies but I did receive a charge on my account."
1,"Right numbers, wrong battery.","I very much appreciate the speed of service, but the size of the battery is incorrect. The nomenclature is the same but just doesn't fit in the phone so now I'm stuck with the wrong size batteries."
5,V-Tech cordless phone battery,"V-Tec 80-5071-00-00 Battery (Equivalent)Very satisfied with my purchase! The price was $8.42 total (with S& H) and it is a brand name. I haven't used it for too long yet, and I always keep my phone in the port. The few times that I left if out of the port, it kept its charge well."
1,Wrong size though search for right size brings it up,"I've ordered Empire batteries before and did a search for phone battery 3301. This one came up and I ordered. The ones I received don't match the picture and are not the right size. I was surprised as I got them before and they were the right size as pictured. When you look at what is written after having it come up in the search for the right size, there is little information and size isn't specified making it difficult to know you will get the wrong size. I will order a different brand next time which is too bad as the Empire batteries lasted longer than Lenmar and AT&T."
5,Brought new life to our phones.,"We've been using these for a few weeks now and they're working like a charm, giving our phones long life off the cradle. In fact, we keep them off the cradle often (probably 75% of the time) and have yet to get a low battery or drop out of a phone call. Well worth it for the price!"
1,"Wrong size/battery - Not 3 ""AAA"" hooked together","Needed what would look like 3 - ""AAA"" batteries connected, recieved what looked like 3 ""AA"" batteries connected.Do not fit phone, thus do not work."
5,An unforgettable reading experience...,"Upon being assigned this novel to read as part of my undergraduate coursework, I of course rolled my eyes and sighed...naively assuming that this too would be another boring and mundane reading requirement. Never could I have imagined that not only would I NOT be able to put this book down, but I would also be pleasantly haunted by this marvelous novel.The book itself is gritty, raw, and above all...painfully colorful and honest. Prior to this novel, I had never heard of Reinaldo Arenas, but upon completing this novel for the 5th time, I now find myself reading his other works.As a student, I strongly recommend this novel to my fellow peers and bookworms...you will not be dissapointed...least of all be bored."
3,"An arresting, sad story","A life story that so clearly portrays life under a repressive regime. The author's troubles were greatly compounded by his sexual orientation, tersely and unashamedly stated, his escapades giving brief relief in his tortured experience. Undoubtedly of exceptional literary ability, he is ultimately crushed by both the evil of others and his own recklessness, yet has left a telling inditement of an immoral dictatorship."
3,Fantabulous Loelatta!,All stars for Loleatta. This album is a continuosus mix. It persists of only few songs and some renamed versions of them. If you like Loleatta seek for her original salsoul/goldmine cds and for the twelwe inch versions the salsoul collection cds. This is a waste of money buy.
4,"TERRIFIC VOCALIST, GREAT TUNES - BUT THE CONTINUOUS BEAT MIX IS SO-SO...","... the mixing between tracks 2 and 3 in particular sounds like Beat Mix 101 where a novice DJ missed his cue and brought in ""Vertigo/Relight My Fire"" too late (and to further add insult to injury, left out most of the instrumental intro of ""Vertigo"")... otherwise, this CD is slammin' and this lady's voice is just incredible - she can wail with the best of them, right up there with James Brown."
4,Rockport Sandal SOUTHERN ADVENTURE APM25814,The top ankle strap was too short. I had to sew in over an inch Velcro hooks so that I could fasten it. This may be because I wear a Men's 8-1/2 EE and since there were no wide sizes I ordered a size 9.The rest of the sandal was very well made and comfortable.
4,Rawk!,"These guys are a great heavy rock band! Do you like Melvins, Kyuss, Fu Manchu?! If you live in the Pacific Northwest, or you see them coming to town, go get your fix of their earsplitting live show. This album is badass too!"
5,Cant wait to get it,Man I really want this ring badly.It looks cool and durable.Im tired of small rings.I was getting so disappointed.Now they finally came up with a good idea.Thank you.From Tim Carhuff
2,Official Scale Trash,This ring looked so cool that I had to have it. I was dissappointed with it because it must have been designed by a drunk. The turnbuckle posts keep caving in and one of the plastic supports underneath broke off because of the rope tension. I should have threw my fifty bucks in the trash can than buy this piece of trash!
3,Not great and it's expensive,"I bought the WWE Series One Official Scale Ring with my own b-day $$$ and i'm really mad. I mean it looks cool but it's a piece of junk. The problem is that the ring post supports are plastic and the ring post is metal(the posts keep caving in). It's a whole lot better than the Stunt Action Ring,BUT THE THING'S 50$. I called jakks and they are going to send me replacement parts for it, they were really nice."
3,"Pretty good ring, but not very playable","This Classic Ring is very pleasing to the eye. It is the most accurate looking ring I have seen, but it a definate flaw. It's not very playable unfortunately, the turnbuckles and ring posts have some good parts but Jakks decided to use plastic as the ring supports underneath and also for the mat, and makes this ring very aesthetically pleasing to the eye but not fun to play with, as the posts keep caving in. Probably this item is meant more for display, just dissapointed that Jakks didn't make the entire supports for the ring metal like the posts and more attachable. If they had done so, this would be a 5/5."
3,is this wrestling ring good?,I want this wrestling ring bad for christmas and i was going to get it but i read on all of your reviews that the ring posts bent and the ropes kept falling of. I mean it looks so cool it looks like a real wrestling ring and it looks monstrous it size but im just not sure about it.p.s when is the next chris masters toy coming out? he is the best wrestler and my favorite.
1,not completely happy with product,the ring is very nice looking but there are to many plastic pieces and its not strong enough to hold the ring togetherneed more cast iron pieces at the corners and stornger clamps underneith the ring the plastic clamps keep falling off and the ring continues to collasp i had to put clip binders the type you get at a stationary store and i had to stick long 6 inch nails at the corners to keep the corner buckles from coming out once again the toy is very nice looking and the size is great for my son to play with his wrestlers but it is not sturdyfalls apart very easly and i hope that this review makes it to someones eyes thank you and have a very nice day
2,piece of junk but nice,this is a piece of junk. it does not even last one day. the ring post pulls apart the turnbuckles rip. DO NOT BUY IT. NOT WORTH IT. the ropes also strech
5,Key Exchange: A Must See,"Key Exchange is a wonderful film that was based on a play performed onstage in 1981. This movie version was released in 1985. Ben Masters does a wonderful job portraying the character of Phillip, who struggles to keep a monogamous relationship. The movie focuses around Phillip as he agrees to exchange house keys with his current girlfriend, who is played by Brooke Adams. Filled with humor, excitement, and wonderful actors, this film is a must see."
3,A new cover to an old book,"I have this book first edition; this third edition is not much different from the first one. No CFD, no computer applications and almost the same subjects of 30 years ago. The chapters about MHD, non-newtonian flows and hyper-sonic flows are all but too short; they are almost useless.There is a new chapter about waves which figures are not as good as the older ones.Well, the book is cheap and certainly worths the price."
4,Field Guide to Mushrooms of Britain,"An excellent photo-guide that would have been far more useful to me six months earlier.Amongst the clear concise information in this volume is the fact that the Stump Puffball is inedible unlike the other true puffballs. The field guides I had last October all said that all the Lycoperdon were edible if eaten young, firm and white. All stating this to be true of the Pear-Shaped or Stump Puffball, Lycoperdon pyriforme.As some readers may be eating their lunch I will not describe the symptoms that I suffered.The only reason I don't give this book five stars is because it isn't bigger. It could do with covering a few more species."
2,Thunder & Lightning,"Odd combo of actors, wasnt all that impressed with this movie. Seemed to drag along. There were some action areas, nudity, etc, but not one movie I'd call an old favorite by any means.Carradine and classic cars, not the mix I'd prefer to see."
1,Pretty bad!,Could not watch the whole movie! Sold this one in a yard sale for $1. Save your money and time and skip this stinker!
1,I was there,"I had a couple of scenes in this movie as background. It premiered at the drive in movie in the county where it was filmed! David Carradine is a fair actor but a snob in person! Kate Jackson, on the other hand was a very nice person! I also had the privilage of doing her hair on the day her stylist had the flu."
2,Buzz from Rebel directed,"I had mentioned that Corey Allen was directing this feature when Sal Mineo was murdered. The photography was terrible by whomever the photographer/cameraman was. Too many ECU's (extreme close-ups). If Corey could redo the film today, I'm sure it would be much better.I bought it because it was one of David Carradine's feature films from a long time ago. Corey Allen was Buzz in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. That role finished his acting career. He was always associated with that role, as the bad guy who fought James Dean. But, his directing career was pretty successful. This should be a collectible just to have a piece of Carradine's work, now that he is gone. I was surprised to see this on Amazon. Practically at a give away price too.Corey died a couple of months after Dennis Hopper. The last featured actor of the cast from REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. He died from Parkinson's disease."
2,Save your money.,"I really didn't care for the movie. Lots of action, but not much thought was given in directing. Save your money."
5,"A fair ""B"" movie","I really liked David Carradine but this was definately not one of his better vehicles. He was better off as a bad guy co-star in Lone Wolf McQuade than starring in this. Still, overall it was a pretty decent plot."
2,The cover art is the best part of this movie. LOL,"No, Really.I bought it as part of a fad I'm going through, looking for car flicks from the 70's. I knew this wouldn't be any Oscar winner, but YEESH! The story line was terrible, the acting about the same & other than the '57 Chevy, there was hardly any cool cars. :DI did like seeing Kate Jackson as a youngster, though."
2,Breaks Frequently,"Heats the room well, not hard to install and not too loud, but the heating elements fail frequently (about once/year)."
1,Inaccurate so far,The section on Frankfurt Germany is terribly inaccurate. The map of the subway system displaces the airport as being in the middle of a river and the train that goes to the airport has a number that doesnt exist. Good luck finding your way around!
4,Around the world...,"There seem to be quite a few books here on Amazon without adequate descriptions. This is basically a course prepared for 11-12th graders, designed to introduce them to the people and practices of the world's major religions. The student's text includes a chapter on eleven of the world's largest religions including Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism, to name a few. Each chapter has a glossary and word pronunciations to help students with new terms. The text also includes an overview of basic questions that religions address. Good resource for the classroom!Justin R. CannonEditor, Sanctified: An Anthology of Poetry by LGBT ChristiansAuthor, The Bible, Christianity, & Homosexuality"
1,Fake Product,"The product this vender ships is fake. DO NOT BUY IT! I did a side by side comparison and while the bottle looks close to the real thing, the printing is blurry compared to a real bottle. The smell is wrong and the results are horrible. This seller should destroy their inventory and STOP SELLING IT!"
1,beware,I have bought this conditioner for years--I just received this product and whatever conditioner is inside is definitely not the right stuff. I returned it and will only buy at the salon from now on.
2,Not woth it,"I puchased both this and the matching shampoo. After two bottles of each, my hair started to feel heavy -- like I hand't rinsed it adequately, even though I know I had. I cancelled my auto ship order after two times."
2,It's ok,This was not my favorite Bumble and Bumble conditioner. And the top wasn't on all the way so some leaked out and at this price every little bit counts.
3,NOT AS GOOD AS 2003 PLAYOFF ..........,"As far as the ""Pet Of The Year"" series goes, this show onlyrates as average. Here, and in the 2003 Playoff, Penthousehave adopted a more softer style. The solo scenes containplenty of exposure, but the girl/girl scenes would be moreat home in Playboy than Penthouse, with mainly side on shots.Most of the solo scenes are good, although this show couldhave done with replacing Devon, as she is more suited toAdult Films than softcore shows. However, the picturequality is superb, and is worth buying if only to see ARIAshow off her spectacular body !!!"
1,"NOT UP TO PENTHOUSE STANDARDS,SEE 2000 WINNER INSTEAD","I WAS HOPING THIS WOULD BE BETTER THAN THE SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING PENTHOUSE PLAYOFF 2003,BUT I WAS WRONG. FIRST OFF THE PET OF THE YEAR 2003 (MS.SUNNY LEONE) HAS ONLY ONE SHORT SOLO SCENE WHERE SHE DOESN'T SHOW MUCH. SECONDLY THE NASTY DEVON(PORNSTAR)GETS THREE SOLO SCENES AND THE CAMERAMAN DOESN'T BOTHER TO HID HER THREE TATOOS. ALSO THE DVD WILL LEAVE FEELING IS THAT IT,ESPECIALLY IF YOU BOUGHT FOR SUNNY LEONE LIKE I DID. LASTLY SCENES ARE SHORT AND DISAPPOINTING,ITS A SHAME WITH WOMAN LIKE SUNNY LEONE,LINN THOMAS,SUZETTE SPENCER WHO ALL LOOK GREAT,THAT THIS DVD COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE INTERESTING,I FEEL CHEATED. SKIP THIS AND PICK UP PENTHOUSE PET OF THE 2000 WINNER STARRING JULIET CARIAGA(POTY 2000),ALEXUS WINSTON(2000 RUNNER UP)IF YOU DON'T ALREADLY HAVE IT!"
1,No wonder Penthouse is on the verge of death,"This is the worst penthouse production I ever encountered. The quality of the video is disgusting and not to mention the choice of models. Neither of the model has no idea of acting and probably Sunny Leone is the worst of the lot. Sunny is not that good looking to begin with then they glammed her up with so much makeup that you may seemed to think it's a fake person with some robotic features. I always wondered how she won the Pet of the year contest. It's needless to mention that it's impossibe to make quality production with couple of prostitutes, especially Sunny. Aria and Devon were glamorous as usual but if you like them buy different video not this ... ."
3,Think before you review,"Okay folks, how about a little perspective on this thing. First, many of you from what I read became Priest fans in the late 80s. That is the JP that you know, and the music that you grew up on. Therefore, you're measuring this album against the wrong measuring stick. Those of us who were listening to them in the early days know that JP wasn't born a metal band, they were a heavy blues band that eventually evolved into the metal band we all know. Frankly, I've always considered the time from this album to Hell Bent for Leather and Unleashed in the East as the best of JP. This album shows their roots, and as such provides us with an opportunity to understand where JP came from, and how they got where they are now. They evolved. This album shows us from where. Don't sell it short."
1,"This is Not Really a ""Judas Priest"" Album","This album is terrible. It was the band's first recording effort and was made before the band conceived of the Judas Priest heavy metal sound. The next album, Sad Wings of Destiny, is when it all began.Buy the metal classics Screaming for Vengeance and British Steel instead. If you are looking to expand your Priest collection further, dig into anything else but Rocka Rolla."
3,The Next One Would Be Where They Achieved Greatness !,"Rocka Rolla is a cool, raw debut hinting at what the group would achieve on the far superior Sad Wings Of Destiny, the greatest metal album of all time. The sound is developing here and it is a good listen despite the almost demo production value.""Diamonds And Rust"" was not a part of the original LP, but it's included as a bonus track here. This is the version that appeared on Gull Records premature Best Of Judas Priest(a money maker on the back catalogue after the band went to CBS).This is still a great archive piece for those daring enough to delve into the great obscure, encrusted seventies relics."
3,Where Priest learned a valuable lesson,"You will notice something different between this album and the others that follow: KK Downing wrote the majority here whereas Tipton wrote the majority on subsequent endeavors. The one song that Tipton was allowed to indulge himself was the title track, which turns out to be the stongest track on the album. The three stars I gave this album is for the title track alone."
4,Rob Halford In Bellbottoms??,"Yep, this is Priest's first effort. Released in 1974, it's not bad at all. Hard to imagine Rob Halford in anything but black leather and spikes, but long hair and bellbottoms?? Horrors! Anyway, ""Rocka-Rolla"" starts out with ""One For The Road"", a cool song with a bluesy vibe. Then, the title song comes in with Halford giving a good performance with a punkish snarl. ""Winter-Deep Freeze-Winter Retreat-Cheater"" are sort of a crazy medly. I love them and think they're under-rated. ""Never Satisfied"" is great. ""Run Of The Mill"" is long and melodic. A personal favorite. ""Dying To Meet You"" is also good. ""Caviar And Meths"" is a short little instrumental. It's great when used as a lead-in for a heavier / faster song on a hits collection. A great album! Try to find the bottle cap cover..."
4,A MUST HA VE!,"Friends, fellow METAL WARRIORS, Rocka Rolla is a fine metal album. It is not of the leather and studs speed metal variety though. This is the Priest's debut, and it is more of an early Sabbath album (they are both from Birmingham) with better vocals. If you are a Priest fan and are unsure about Rocka Rolla, just buy it, you will like it. Also the artwork is cool, and Rob Halford is called ""Bob Halford""."
2,For Priest completists....,"The album Rock A Rolla is the 1st Priest album released way back on Gull Records. Newer fans might have never heard of this one, as its most notable track is ""Diamonds & Rust"" (also featured on the stellar ""Unleashed In The East"". While this is good rock & roll, this should not ne your introduction to Judas Priest music. New fans should look for ""Stained Class"" or ""Hell Bent For Leather"" first, and then grab this item to complete their Priest collections."
1,Super High in Arsenic,This formula tested at 27 ppb for inorganic arsenic by Dartmouth Univ. The limit for inorganic arsenic in drinking water for adults is 10 ppb. Don't poison your babies.
3,A quick read,"While this book was good, I did not enjoy it as much as her other books. Some of it was kind of hard to believe, but it was still very entertaining."
3,easy read,"An easy read. Maybe too easy, as if the author were explaining things to a child. Much was thought out word for word and then further rehashed out in simple dialogue. The scenes were sexy though sadly the intimate scenes came in some post-grief type moments.The author has a way with male characters view points. They come across manly and very sexy. That and the story of the rose society was enough to keep me interested in Scandal of the Black Rose. Plus, I wanted to find out who dunnit. Anybody could be the killer."
2,Not that necessary,"I am a big fan of Jordan Rubin and I believe the Makers Diet is right on, but I didn't use the Journal. It could be because I'm not a person who journals."
2,"Just because it's ""Classic"" doesn't mean I want to read it","I was assigned this book for a college course and really didn't care for it. This book is relatively old now and that is reflected in the writing style. My professor explained that because she was a woman working in the (then) male dominated academic world she felt she had to prove herself by including a lot of quotes in different languages and just through her general style of writing.Some parts were very interesting but they were too far and few between to make me really want to read this book. I appreciate that this book was groundbreaking when ti was originally published but now there are newer, easier to read and more interesting books you can find to get the same information."
3,not bad,this cd might be 5 stars for some..but i just wanted plain reggaeton.. i don't like the mixture of rap.. so i gave it 3 stars
5,Lito y Polaco desde el 1993 estan dando palos,"Maybe for all your who are reading this is a new reggaeton duo but they been in the game since 1993.This is there 5th production and is the best one because they have all kinds of rhytms: reggaeton,rap R & B and Hip Hop which is there trademark so this is a classic buy it FUERA DE SERIE PAPI!!!! This Is The Discography Of Lito y Polaco Los Tres Mosqueteros(With M.C. Ceja former partner),Masacrando MC's,Los Exitos Vol. 1,Mundo Frio,Fuera de Serie"
4,Bears in the Caviar,"""Bears in the Caviar"" is an interesting report on Charles Thayer's adventures in 1934 as an embassy aide and ambassador to Russia and Afghanistan, accompanied at times by a Chinese servant, four dogs, a horse and a falcon. Thayer is a delightful raconteur who rises to every near-disaster with humor and aplomb."
3,Not the best if FLASH is what you are working on,"This book is not well laid out. The index does not separate Flash from Dreamweaver topics. Over all, I'd give it a C+ Since I am fairly proficient at Dreamweaver, I can't really comment on how a beginner woud see that part of the book. Oh, and it's NOT that visual! Lots of crowded text."
3,Good enough,"It's good for a new beginner,no to much computer -application-jargon. Even that I'm taking lesson -live- the book help me to understand a lot better what I'm learning because I can do it on my own pace. The way the content it is express is very easy to follow and understand, I would say i; it worth it."
2,Simplicity ruled with the purchase of this book,"I am a total novice to Dreamweaver - only my desire to learn exceeded my knowledge. Having read many previous books on the subject I was becoming quite depressed at getting nowhere. I found this book informative where I needed it to be, easy to follow and the only Dreamweaver Book that guided me to success. I now even have a job updating web pages thanks to what I learned in this book. I highly recommend it for all ages. My son is now referencing from it as well. Learning Flash 8 is a blast as well."
4,it's good,"some interesting tidbits here&there,nothing earth shattering but a good read to have on your book table or something to share some of the qoutes with folks here&there. it's entertaining&is a good read.this Book represents some of the biggest Names of Black Entertainment in various aspects."
5,Smooth Ride!,I installed these in my 2000 Miata and now she rides better than new as I think these are better than the original ones that the factory put in.
5,My baby loves it but..... i am having a hard time,"I love this formula... so far, this is the only formula out there that is good for our little ones. no gmo, no anti-biotics, no harms of the chemical world...the problem is: the powder is hard to dissolve on water...when mixing, shaking the formula, it creates a lot of bubblesany experiences like mine?"
5,We Loved it,"We Loved the formula for our daughter. We supplemented my breastmilk with this from 6 wks to a year. It smelled much better than other formulas. I would highly recomend it. We had a nice plump, healthy, smart, organic baby!"
4,"As far as formula goes, this is the best","NO GMOs, good ingredients. I feel comfortable supplementing my infant's diet with this. The only drawback are the soy ingredients (oil and lethicin- but both are organic). I try my best to keep my children (and the rest of my family) away from soy because of the mal effects of soy phytoestrogens, but it is nearly impossible if using a manufactured food."
5,Excellent resource for Latin Teachers,"This text is my First Semester ""Mythology Day Friday"" Latin IA text, and on a weekly basis the students build their English vocabulary, connect the stories to contemporary issues and vocabulary and science concepts (e.g. heliocentric from Lesson 12's ""Minor Gods: Helios...""). It's perfect for grades 7 - 9, especially to support ninth graders preparation for the SATs. I have used this text for over 12 years, and highly recommend it to Latin teachers and English teachers, and whoever enjoys reading the Classical myths while building their English vocabulary. A+!In The Theater of the World"
4,climalite pants for less,"I ordered a size small of this product and found that the fit is a little loose. I normally wear size 2 in pants and small in sportwear. When I compare it to the champion's lyrca activepants that I have, the cut is looser in adidas. Actually, in the tag of the pants it was written ""loose fit"". In the waist line it does not look loose, but around hips you feel the loose cut. To give you an idea, I do not use the zipper, and can wear it without unzipping. My feeling is that small would fit better to a size 4 person. Despite the loose cut, I like the product. Climalite is really comfortable after long hours of working out and keeps you feel less wet. The length of the pants are not short, even a little on the longer side, so if you're on the taller side it won't be an issue. For the price offerred on amazon, I think it was a good deal."
2,Not too fond,I'm a size 6 and I should have purchased a small (I purchased a medium.) They are too long on the inseem and too loose. The length is good.
5,I am loving it!,"I am 5'5"" and a size 0/2 (or junior size 3/4), and size small fits OK on me -- yes, it's a bit roomy, but that's what I expected for loose fit pants. The pant sits about an inch below my belly button, and there's no need for me to use the zipper at all. For $9.50, I really have nothing to complain about!"
5,Tantanacui - Lively and Spirited,"I've had the opportunity to see Quichua Mashis twice. I found their music pleasant and refreshing. What struck me most was how the band members enjoyed putting on their show. They seemed to have as much fun playing their music as those of us in the audience did listening to it. If you're looking for fun, yet relaxing music, Tantanacui is the listener's choice. I know you'll enjoy it."
2,Strictly non-traditional,"Quichua Mashis have done some excellent CD's of Andean music, but this is NOT one of them -- too much Latin pop. If you are looking for Latin pop I guess it's ok, but I think half of it stinks."
5,NOT BAD...NOT BAD AT ALL!!,"It usually takes me some time to write an online review...I have to actually give myself time to ""feel"" the CD before I can give an accurate and objective review. Not this CD though. ""Jump Leads"" had me hooked and loving it at the very beginning! I have always been a fan of Fila Brazilia's music since I first heard ""A Zed and Two L's"" and this is my first CD from them, actually my second CD --I did buy ""Another Late Night with Fila Brazilia"" but somebody stole it-- ""Jump Leads"" is an eclectic set of songs that range from R & B to funk to jazz to country to disco to pop to world and rock...I'm big on multi-genre music on CDs and ""Jump Leads"" has it. Songs that bare repeated listening are ""Bumblehaum"",""Nightfall"", ""Motown Coppers"",""Spill the Beans"", ""We Build Arks"" and ""Mother Nature's Spies."" Whether or not you care for these particular favorites of mine, you'll definitely find your song on this CD. Very impressive!!"
3,Works but it needs a makeover.,for a 1980s gimmick gift it's great but now in the 21st century where you expect everything to work better and you're used to better basic buttons these get on my nerves. All the numbers on the face of the watch have no give so you never really know if you pressed them or not. The watch works but it's annoying to use any of the buttons on the face of the watch. I don't use it at all since it's pretty annoying to press each button so it just sits around doing nothing.
4,interesting choices,a good collection if you already have the big lebowski.i purchased this collection because it was the deal of the day and priced at i recall $20 or so.great for that price!
4,Good collection,"I became interested in the Coen brothers after seeing ""No Country for Old Men"". I had liked Fargo, but was unnerved by it and felt uncomfortable afterwards. I realize that this is exactly the reaction they were trying for.So far, we've seen three of the other movies and while they were enjoyable, did not rise to the level of ""No Country"""
4,Coen Brothers 5 DVD Pack,"Amazon was excellent, fast shipping, great price. The set of 5 DVD's arrived intact and in time for Christmas gift. The dvds themself are great if you are a Coen Bros. fan...if not you should watch them to see what great movies they produce."
3,Not for beginners and not for anyone for this price,"It's basically only 30 minutes of Misty swimming butterfly filmed from the all possible angles and in slow motion too.Divided in 6 chapters/tips which she considers the most important and which she demonstrates.It could be easily added another 26 tips that still wouldn't work for everyone.No drills, no turns/starts/finishes, no gradual building of technique, nothing - just Misty swimming ( what's the most amazing, in case this is her personal promo, ""The Race"" on Olympics is not included! )She swims very nice, but you can see almost all on the promo clip on goswim.tv and 40$ can be spent more effectively"
3,Track List,Peak chart position and year are shown for released singles that charted (Billboard 100 Top Singles). There are only two.1. Getcha Back - #26 (1985)2. It's Gettin' Late - #82 (1985)3. Crack at Your Love4. Maybe I Don't Know5. She Believes in Love Again6. California Calling7. Passing Friend8. I'm So Lonely9. Where I Belong10. I Do Love You11. It's Just a Matter of Time12. Male Ego
4,Not Too Bad.....,"Next to Pet Sounds I have listened to this more than any other BB release. Yes, it sounds 80's, but Getcha Back, California Calling, ""It's a Matter of Time"" and ""I still Love You"" are great. The vocals are great and there is a guest appearance by Stevie Wonder and Ringo Starr. Ignore the mild 80's sound and Dr. Landy's participation and you will find a most enjoyable album."
2,Awkward design,"This battery performs OK as a battery and holds a charge reasonably well, but does not last as long on a single charge as the real DeWalt DW9061 (especially the XR version). The one really poor aspect of this battery is the design of the clips for locking and releasing the battery in the power tool. The clips don't release very easily for removing the battery and I have to resort to pliers and a screwdriver to convince it to come out. It's a real pain and not worth the few bucks saved - buy a DeWalt battery and save yourself the aggravation."
1,possibly the worst science fiction book ever published,"I ordered this off Amazon because this was the first science fiction novel I ever read. I think I picked it up when I was seven or eight years old and struggled through it. Since growing up, I've always wondered what it was like, since I only carried a vague memory of the plot with me. Well, take it from me, G. Eklund is a godawful writer. The book is alternately boring, depressing and interminable, and usally all three at once. Somehow I got through it for the second time, though it cost me just as much effort as when I was seven years old.With this as an introduction, it's a wonder I grew up loving Sci Fi."
5,WOW!,"It's rare to find such a prolific writer in someone so young. Every track made me want more. Ms. Champion has something special that's hard to describe... Passionate melodies and poignant lyrics, this is definitely a must have album. Alicia Champion is and will be a force to be reckoned with."
5,Amazing,"This cd is amazing. I can't believe she did everything herself, that is really admirable. I highly recommend it to everyone, it's a beatiful collection of stories and songs."
2,Doesn't work any better than the standard vinyl stripe king,"I used this on my 9-ft wide wood garage door. I drilled holes into the two aluminum track so I can screw them into bottom of the garage door. Had to brush talcum powder into the groove to slide the vinyl piece through the whole 9-foot expanse, and stretched the vinyl in the process. When I had the standard vinyl seal that Home Depot & Lowes sell for wood garage doors, the garage door closed with a small gap (1/3"" high, 2 inch wide) on the right end of the door. After I ripped out the old seal (sigh) and installed this, I now have a 1/2"" high, 4 inch wide gap on the opposite end of the door ???!!!. Still working on how to remove that darn gap?"
3,Not what I was expecting,"I ordered this thinking it was made of a heavier rubber and would stand up better than what I already had installed. Turned out to be exactly the same, so I sent it back."
1,Very Poor Product,"The poor packaging is a clue to how lousy this product is. No screws were included and there were no pre-drilled holes in the aluminum track. The rubber insert is thin and arrived very bent out of shape. For this kind of money, it's a terrible value and I would describe it as an insufficient solution to the problem you want to solve. Far better (and cheaper) would be a think rubber seal with an angled forward edge. Save your money. Forget this product. If this is supposed to be one of M-D's better products, I question their entire line of products. Mine is going to be returned, that's for sure."
2,Will last up to a month !,"This product is packaged in such a way that when you try to slide the rubber piece (seal) into the aluminum guide it is very difficult because there was a permanent crease in the rubber seal which prevented it from going into the groove of the aluminum guide. Even without the crease it was extremely difficult to slide the rubber piece through the channel. After it had been mounted for about a week the rubber seal came out of the channel and is now hanging down in the middle of the garage door. Also, I wish I had known that the screws used to attach the seal to the door required a hex driver (not a regular flat blade or Phillips head screwdriver), which I didn't have available at the time so I ended up nailing the aluminum strip to the door (I can't wait until I have to rip it off the door)."
5,Replacement Rubber Garage Door Bottom,"This product was easy to install. It makes it easier if someone feeds the rubber bottom while you pull it through the tracks. The screws were to short,they needed to be 1/2"" longer."
4,garage door seal,The garage door went in just as planned or instructed. I would say that everything we smothly. The only issue I has was putting the seal on in -25 degree weather but evan with that said I can really compain about this product. Great deal better than what I took off the garage door. Thanks
3,"This book has its good points, but it's not the best","I really like the concept of this book. Each page has the numeral, the spelled-out number, dots equal to the number, and a photograph illustrating the number. Four different ways to illustrate a number on each page.The problem is that it is not all that interesting.Some of the photographs are a bit fuzzy, as though they are extreme enlargements from an original photo. And it is just hard to get excited about nine beads on a string, even though the photo is crisp and clear.My son doesn't dislike this book, but if I pick it out to be read he only wants me to go through it once.Another counting book that he seems to like a bit better is ""Miss Spider's Tea Party : The Counting Book"" by David Kirk and Antoinette White (Editor). It is different from Tana Hoban's book in that it is a story that also happens to illustrate counting, but my son wants to hear that one over and over."
4,FINALLY,"Jakks finally comes out with a new rikishi and scotty, bad part is they have ttl arms. Biggest mistake is scottys arms are bigger than rikishis!,i dont know why? any way should have came with a weapon besides belts. rikishis pony tail might fall off, if you throw it around and rikishis legs are kind of weird i would get this if you dont have a rikishi or scotty or tag belts or even both i do like these both"
4,Quality book,"This is a good quality, well-put-together book that brings into one place much of Chesterton's short fiction, most of which was published in periodicals or never published. This is the first time most of these stories have been published in book form, if I'm not mistaken."
5,An outstanding teaching tool,"This work is an outstanding translation of Hebrew poetry in a parallel in prose English text. Most of the greats of Hebrew poetry are featured , and the translations are line - by- line with explications.I used this work a great deal when I was first studying Hebrew , and was helped by it greatly."
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"I have always loved the Nutcracker -- and the fact that my daughter has been in ballet for 12 years, we tend to buy a several different versions of the same thing. We bought the Ballet Classics several years ago, and it is one of the best ""Nutcracker""s I've ever heard. My daughter, who is 16 now, listening to rap and hip-hop, also loves this version -- ""borrowed"" it from our collection and it was stolen. Now I am searching for the exact same thing to replace it. So, you see, it's worth buying *twice*! The musicality and skill of the performers gives the music a dreamy passion. The CD provides clear tones, no odd noises to interfer. I only wish I could give it more than 5 stars!"
1,Color Me Baddddddd,God awful movie pretending to be a movie about film god. Excruciating plot lines and uninspired characters makes your humble narrator cringe at every scene. All work and no play makes John Malkovich a dull boy indeed.
3,"Hammy Malkovich, disappointing conclusion but this is fun for Kubrick fans",John Malkovich hams it up shamefully as conman Alan Conway who impersonated Stanley Kubrick for years despite being openly gay and looking nothing like him! The film pokes fun at celebrity and has continuous references to many of Kubrick's films. It fun for the first two thirds but then peters out to an unsatisfying conclusion. Kubrick fans will probably enjoy it most.
3,entertin-ish,"It is much easy to tag a product-as done in this case already by an Amazon member- with any word dropped in a head than comment this movie, definitely.With funny music and a nice performance it is still rather entertin-ish than entertaining as long dialogues overshadow both actions if any, and distract from musical canvasses.This is my very personal opinion of course."
1,Full Metal Rubbish!,"I think this must be just about the worst film I have ever seen. The acting is uniformly awful, especially Malkovitch who hams it up so much it is soon boring. Jim Davidson as a fat, unfunny comedian is type-cast and the Kubrick in jokes are about as subtle as being hit on the head with a brick. Avoid at all costs, save your money and 90 minutes of your life. Why do I have to give it 1 star?????"
5,Malkovich is fabulous...as usual.,"Never wanted it to end. The peripheral characters are wonderful - the gullible and the not-so-gullible. It's amazing that this sociopath was able to get away with impersonating the great director for so long. Whatever - mostly, it's a hilarious comedy in which Malkovich (as one reviewer put it snidely, but for me was what made it great) really chews the scenery. The costumes are brilliant - the posing, the accents (different for every con) - it all made me howl with laughter. You could say this film is a ""guilty pleasure"" since you know what he's doing to people is bad, bad, bad, but you can't help wanting more, more, more. In the end, the imposter went unpunished, and died of ""natural"" causes. That's a little hard to swallow. One wanted him to get his legal comeuppance. Anyway, it's hard to find truly wicked, witty, funny comedies these days, and this is one of them. (Another is ""Death At A Funeral."" If you liked that, you'll probably like this one.)"
3,Johnny Boy...,John Malkovich was perfect for this movie. I found myself chuckling a lot throught the film. Interesting story.
3,Overpriced,"This is a nice short film on windsurfing...visually interesting..nice features of being able to view either a back or forward loop from multiple angles...however, at only 50 minutes long, this should be priced in the $10-$15 range. I realize this is sold as Volume #1, but I will not be buying any future volumes at this price."
2,Not so great,"I should have judged by the title. What settled for this because there were no others on the market. I wanted big air and amazing footage, and there isn't much."
2,I got sick...,"I bought and used this product for about 6 months, every day, and I got sick anyway. I am a very healthy person, I eat right and don't smoke or drink, and I bought this product because of it's natural ingredients and with hopes of keeping me from getting the yearly flu/cold, as some have posted... well, I'm sorry to say that it did not work for me. I had high hopes that it would."
4,"Teddy, Teddy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",One of the greates voices of soul music...to bad there is a few gems missing from this collection. Still a good buy.
3,So So,"In theory this is a great machine. Mine came used. The left side is used for hen you only want one cup. That works great. when I tried o make two at the same time, the left would overfill and the right would only be about 3/4. This may be because mine was used before I received it. Other than that it works great"
3,Just passes.,Not as good as Cuisinart coffee maker we used to have. No automatic shut off and does not brew as hot as the Cuisinart did. The filtering system leaves very fine grinds in cup towards the bottom and basket is in the back which is cumbersome. But I guess you get what you pay for.
4,Good value,"This coffeemaker is very convenient for a couple with different coffee tastes. In my case, one likes decaf and the other likes regular. With this unit we brew at the same time. One downside for some people is that the coffee temperature is just right by European standards, but it may not be hot enough for American tastes. My wife and I love it."
2,Poor Tasting,"My wife and I will make coffee for ourselves, on the weekends, this machine replaced a different brand that finally gave up the ghost. The maker does not produce good tasting coffee, not sure if the water gets hot enough or does not have time to adequately drip. Additionally, there is not an automatice power off. We are looking for another single serve drip maker, our previous model (which I had purchased 3 times as each one died) is no longer available. I can't recommend this product if you like quality taste in your coffee."
2,Replacement for an expired model,"We had a great little coffee maker that, after many years, we had to replace. Unfortunately that model isn't being made anymore so I thought I'd give this one a try. It's not so great.The thermal mugs are nice and the unit itself looks good but the design is a little difficult to use. The filters where you put the groud coffee are kind of in back of the machine and swing out towards you to be filled. So it you have it against the wall you have to more the unit whenever you fill it. Becasue of the angle to get the grinds in they always get all over the place.It also doesn't make hot coffee unless you use very hot water to make it."
3,Fair,"Doesn't turn off automatically. Makes ok coffee. You need to make sure you put your cup on proper side to make one cup. Otherwise, really messy"
3,"OK, but not great","We used this item on a trip so we could brew coffee when away from home. It is all plastic with a bit of metal, so you do not have to worry about a glass pot breaking. The controls are a bit confusing on choosing whether to brew one cup or two. The brew baskets are kind of cheap, so hope they hold up over time. But it does heat up the water and brews acceptable coffee."
1,"Good idea, but did not work.",I liked the idea of brewing two cups of different coffee at the same time. But cleaning was difficult and removing the brew basket was impossible. Regular paper filters are not available which would make cleaning easier.
2,Toastess dual coffee maker dissappointment,While very convenient for households that drink decaf and caffinated I was dissappointed on two counts. First the coffee is not very hot and the cups do not insulate very well. Secondly there is no automatic shut off when brewing is complete.
1,poor design and quality,"The good: inexpensiveThe not so good:poor design: 1.) this unit is not well designed for counter top under cabinet use. The filter holders open to the rear, obligating the user to pull the unit out from under any kitchen wall cabinets in order to put coffee into the filters 2.) water is not dispensed equally at all between the two sides: the right side on my unit gets about 1.5 times as much water as the left, so the left side has to be about 1/2 full to avoid having the right side spill over 3.) the coffee is very weak - no comparison with the coffee quality from the 10 year old Black and Decker unit I replaced this with. It seems that the water is too cool once it reaches the coffee/filter to make strong coffee so I have to use quite a bit more coffee per cup than usual (same coffee and grind).Quality control may be an issue with this unit since some reviewers had great results while others had experiences similar to mine."
3,Just ok,"Initially I liked this coffee maker. After about a month of use the door that holds the filter for the grounds wouldn't stay shut. I ended up having to tape the door shut for every use. If I didn't use tape the door would open and brew the coffee all over the counter instead of into the cup. Also, the coffee temp was just warm, never hot."
5,Perfect for camper!,Bought this for our camper. I didn't want to have a glass carafe which would break. This is compact and perfect. Recommend to all fellow campers.
3,An unique coffee maker,This is an unique 2 large cups coffee maker. It has 2 odd baskets to put the coffee grounds in. It is designed to put an even amount of coffee from one water container into two cups. It needs watching to keep one cup from over flowing. The coffee does not stay hot in the containers long. It is wise to put the coffee into a insulated container if the coffee is not drunk right a way. The advetised version gives the wrong impression of how it works. However I did not send it back. fff
4,I really like this little coffeemaker.It is great for 1-2 people. I would like the brewing water to be just a little hotter.,This is great for A.M. coffee on the go. But you have to make sure you shut it off befor you leave.
4,Excellent,"Excellent coffee maker, and the two different brewing system if perfect for people who like stronger/weaker coffee. VERY handy when running out the door in the a.m. Good size travel mugs, and takes up very little counter space"
2,Not for coffee connoisseurs,"I bought this coffee maker three months ago to replace my old Melita Take Two which made delicious coffee but is no longer available. This Toastess just doesn't make very good coffee and I am now going to replace it. I think the problem may be that the water isn't hot enough to extract the full flavor from the coffee but, whatever the cause, I'm done. I would not recommend this to anyone who is fussy about flavor. I've just put a Zojirushi coffee maker in my Amazon cart so I'm hoping for results worth the price."
3,Like the coffeemaker...,".....don't like the mugs. When I used the mugs the second time, I noticed liquid dribbling down my chin. It wasn't coffee tho, and it turned out to be that the mug is leaking under the seal rim, so whatever is leaking out is the liquid they sealed in between the outside wall and the thermal wall. Not sure what that is, but I'm not drinking out of it."
3,Twin Coffee Maker,"I used this for a very short time, Not worth the cost for it, and I wouldn't purchase it again just for that reason"
4,Great source for coffee for this machine,Some reviews mention difficulty with telling the difference between a single and double brew setting. I agree with other reviewers who said just pay attention to the graphics on the machine and you'll figure it out. Mainly I wanted to share a great source for coffee pods I found that work great in this machine. I was using loose ground coffee but sometimes emptying and rinsing can be messy. Through Green Tree Coffee you can get single serve pods that fit perfectly in this machine. My husband likes one but I use two as I like it a little stronger. They are relatively inexpensive considering they are individually wrapped. Shipping is fast and economical and with each order they send me a coupon for % off my next order. I love this coffee maker and these coffee pods make it an even better functioning unit.
1,Stay away,The cups are nice but the design of the brewer is horrible. It splatters all over the place regardless of how you position the cup and cleaning the filter only adds to the mess.
2,Poor Workmanship,"This is a very convenient coffee maker. However, the workmanship is very poor. We have had it for about a year. The filters are fragile and tear easily. Replacing them is extremely time consuming, and customer service is not very accommodating. Additionally, after about four months of use, water started leaking out of the reservoir and down the front of the machine. Furthermore, on the one-cup setting, a sizable amount of the water still drips into the second cup, resulting in measuring difficulties. I strongly recommend going with a different brand/model."
3,Nice looking machine,"We were looking for a coffee pot that did not drip after making a cup of coffee. Unfortunately, this one did some, although not as bad as the ones we have had before. It is a very nice looking coffee maker and the mugs really keep the coffee hot longer than others we have had."
4,Coffee & Tea To Go,"I gave this to my Mom as a gift for her to have in her small clothing stand, and she loves it!"
2,It Only Lasted 8 Months,"The product worked as described.I found out very quickly that I didn't need a coffee maker that makes two different kinds of coffee at the same time.I ended up primarily using it to make hot water for tea.Anyway, it quit on me this month 09/2011. I bought it in January 2011 and it died in September 2011 so that's about 8 months of use. Not a very good value."
3,none,The coffee pot brews fast and the coffee is hot but not hot enough for me; I like to add cream to my coffee. It also leaks from the back if the doors are not closed properly. I am thinking of starting with hot water and maybe it will be warmer after it brews.
4,great game,its challenging. and multiplayer is fun. but the only problem i have is that there are no cheat codes or faqs out yet.
4,y so few?,"this is not a review it's a comment, the others that rated this game say thay liked it a lot but, gave it zero stars... just thought i should say something about that, so you should know that more stars is better.i just got this game and love it i haven't enjoyed a FPS on PS2 in a long time (no Mouse). I'm giving it 5 stars cuz its dam good and to counter what was probably unintentional zeros by the other posts.as far as lack of multi player options... Net play is just a bonus here.Live the game people :)"
4,"Good game, but a fair warning...","I bought this game for my brother for christmas. He really likes it, and it seems to me I could get into it as well. However, there is a problem, but only because of the FPS (mainly). I have motion sickness sometimes, and when I was watching my brother play this, after ten minutes, I felt like I was going to throw up, and I had to go lie down. Ive played FPS's myself, and when im in control, that doesnt usually happen. But its a word of warning: Dont get this game if you get motion sick easily."
2,Great idea terrible execution!,The game it self is pretty neat too look at looks very 3-d and i really appreciated the original thought put into it. But the game it self totally had no substance. the story was boring the aiming is way too damn hard to be a simple game. I loved the way it looked but other than looks the game supplies nothing. I wouldnt of gave it any stars Had the graphics not looked so cool!Side note to designers Make a game where the bodies dont disipear after you kill sombody!!! that totally ruins a game!!!
1,gotta wait for a new computer,Thought I had all the power I needed to install and play XIII. Make sure you can play 32 bit games. Save your money if your not sure and stick with Half-Life.UBISOFT's technical writers need to include everything.My computer is fairly new so I guess I can return it or squirrel it away to play years from now on a new computer.
1,"Agree with the other guy, Dont buy it! Rent it!","I personally finished the game. The graphic is ??? different people have different taste, I wont go there. the control is bad, as matter of fact all FTPs are bad on gamepads. The game uses check point system, which mean u die, u do eveything again, pointless and lame.The ending was the worst part: It was a lame way to suck more innocent money from players. XIII is not Matrix, it cant do the same. Also, the Bot challenge was bad, you play against (or with)computers. The AI is bad and weapons are hard to handle.The story was confusing, still no idea what's going on. I heard the game was based on 1/3 of the comic story, which means Ubi want to suck more money with 2 more sequels. DONT LET THAT HAPPEN, Dont buy the game to prevent that from happening."
1,It sucked!!,I didnt like it at all.....It had no pont to it!.....the grafics was good but i hated the grafics of the people!
2,2nd blanket to come apart,"This is the second one of these red Nautica blankets that I've bought for my son. Both blankets came unraveled at the seam upon the very first wash. I washed in gentle cycle and used woolite. We also have this blanket in Navy and it's great, but for some reason both of our red ones have come completely apart. I won't be buying any more red ones!"
4,Great Gift for a Baby!,"I chose this blanket as a keepsake for my newborn son. It's a radiant red color that has a very elegant look to it. The material is soft and the knitting makes it somewhat breathable for baby to snuggle with. The only thing is it's on the small side so you can only use it when your baby is a baby. It serves my purpose, as a keepsake blanket."
3,The Burke and Hare Storey Updated for a Modern Audience,"I knew when I read the back of the DVD what I was in for with this movie. To make things short, this is an almost scene for scene remake of ""The Flesh and the Fiends"" film also marketed as ""Psycho Killers"" ""Mania"" or ""The Fiendish Ghouls"". Those who have compared this to a ""Hammer"" film, may be interested to know that Hammer regular actor Peter Cushing played the main character role (Dr. Knox in this version instead or Dr. Rock) and also it also started Donald Pleasance of Halloween fame. Interestingly enough although these films have a kind or Frankenstein feel to them, they are based on the true story of the William Burke and William Hare Case of Scotland (1827 - 28). Although I prefer the Peter Cushing version, This was not a bad movie, I purchased mostly just for comparative reasons, but was entertained by the movie when I sat down to watch it."
3,FAIR,LIKED DALTON BUT STORY SEEM UNFINISHED NOT ENOUGH INFO ABOUT PERSONS LIKE SOMETHING SLAPPED TOGETHER IN ONE DAY COULD HAVE BEEN GOOD STORY IF DONE RIGHT
2,So - so movie,"I produced and directed the America Premier of a stage adaptation of this screenplay off-Broadway in NYC in the mid-70's. Having done much research into the subject including reading the transcript of the trial of Burke and Hare and the writings of Robert Knox I found that this film -- though cast with fine actors and with all the possible resources available to film making and not to a stage production -- fails to offer the audience any real incite into the horror of the story. Rather it makes a feeble, hollywoodish attempt to bring Dylan Thomas' screenplay to life."
2,"Low power, weak","Very Low power in these NiCd's.....only 350mAh. Unless you need to use NiCd's, I recommend you get some NiMh's, they have power ratings over 1000mAh's."
3,Great perspective for playing white.,"If you are going to write a book to play well as black, shouldn't you be viewing the board from black's view point?This book is designed so if you are playing white (who already has an advantage), you will be able to know your opponent even better.It would be nice if they would at least flip black's pieces around so you can flip the book and see both view points.A big part of chess is pattern recognition. It would be nice not to have to flip it mentally when you are trying to learn."
1,cheesy,I bought this for our theater group to inprove our sound library. We did use some of them for a few years till we hooked in a computer to the sound board. now we get most thu the internet. many of these sounds were down right cheesy
2,"Effects disappointing, sound quality moderate",I've had this for a long time but don't use it much as most of the sounds are pretty bad. Things like laughter and cheering are forced and unrealistic (and are essentially useless). The quality of the recordings aren't very good either.
2,Does not work well on older Eljer Touch Flush Toilets,"Bought this kit in order to attempt to repair an older Eljer ""Touch Flush"" toilet. The style of the Eljer uses a plastic bracket mounted to the tank bolt in order to secure the flapper. This mount had snapped, and in order to attempt to repair this toilet *without* removing the tank, I purchased this kit. The kit installed fine. I cleaned the surfaces as directed and the parts adhered without issue. However, after a month of regular use, the seal began to leak. I do not use any chemicals in the bowl of the tank, but rather it appears the act of flushing the toilet was enough to break the seal. This may be an issue with the design of these older Eljer toilets and the amount of water pressure against the flapper. Regardless, the seal did not hold up. I have discarded this kit and removed the tank to install a new Eljer mount/flapper."
5,NO more leaking!! YEA!!,This flusher fixer kit does an excellent job. No more leaking toilet tank. Got instructions on the computer. Easy to install. Highly recommend.
2,needs better sealant,"The design of this unit at first had me inpressed. It is VERY straight forward and simple. The putty ring at the bottom is designed to fit a mutitude of toilet rings in a variety of materials.I had this thing installed in 3 minutes! Very happy! but why 2 stars??Well, after about 30 flushes the seal does not hold and the unit runs full open all day long! A quick re-seat of the putty rings works for only a day or two.I am in the tank every day. Replacing this thing tonight.So 1 Star for a good idea, 1 star for not ripping me off....but get a better system for attachment.I would not recommend this."
1,Doug is 100% correct.,"I have used this kit on several toilet repairs over the last 10 years. I kept getting it because I found it has the best design for adjusting the length of flush over any other design I have tried. However, after reading Doug's review, I realized that all these years I have been struggling with the plastic chain problem and large hook problem exactly as he has described them. If you don't want to risk running your well dry I suggest you avoid this kit until Fluidmaster replaces the plastic chain with a metal one."
5,A thought provoking metaphor,"While Moosey Moose doesn't have the tense build up of the Whaley Whale storyline, his avant garde sense of fashion and firm stance on what he wants can be a statement of the bigger picture of going with your gut regardless of the pressure that society puts on you (to wear short pants or long pants, as the case may be). One should not be tethered to the constraints of wearing pants on their lower extremities. They should be free to wear them on their antlers - or lacking antlers, one should be free to wear their pants on their head. At least that's what I got out of this wonderfully illustrated story :)"
5,"Beautiful,Sensuous,Handsome,Sexy!!","In this video are the ""Beautiful People"" and the ""Dream Machines"" of Hollywood.They are the ""Hollywood Sex Symbols"" from""Theda Bara""(The Original Vamp) to the reknowned ""Elizabeth Taylor"".Featured also are Rudolph Valentino,Clark Gable,Mae West,Rita Hayworth,Sophia Loren,Tyrone Power,Cary Grant,Paul Newman,Jayne Mansfield,Elvis Presley,Brigette Bardot,Robert Redford and the incomparable and legendary Marilyn Monroe which makes""Hollywood Sex Symbols"" a sexy,sensuous must see delight!!"
2,"Poor, a lemon !",Very poor veido/audio quality. Sorry I purchased this lemon. Do youself a favor and pass on this one and save your money !
5,The Simulation Bible,"This book is a great resource for the simulation of chemical processes. It's an interesting book to read and keeps you engaged. It is exciting when ideas are explained simply and in the context of their utility (very refreshing and invigorating). This series is a great resource for a process engineer.I however must express my dismay at the expense. I have a copy from the University Library which I read. The quality of the book is much higher that most engineering texts. I hope to start my down-payments on the book next year and will hopefully have it payed off by years end.Lastly, that fact that Dr. Dimian wrote this book by himself is completely amazing. Nice work!-MF"
5,hellacious,I spent a year with the first brigade of the fifth infantry division from quang tri to khe sahn to gio lihn to con thien. hell on earth.
1,Con Thien - Hill of Angels,"Jim Coan was my Marine tank platoon leader during part of my 12 month & 29 day tour in Vietnam. I have read countless historical volumes about the War in Vietnam. Jim tells one of the most comprehensive and detailed histories of this God-forsaken piece of real estate that I have ever read. ""Con Thien - The Hill of Angels"" should be required reading on the Commandant of the Marine Corps Career Enhancement Reading Program. Five Stars and two thumbs up for his wonderful book.John WearAlfa Co, 3rd Tank BnFormer Sgt of MarinesEDIT: I just realized that my review has just one star...this book should be SIX stars!!!"
4,A liitle campy but good,"This series from the 70s is about a group of young people who discover they are the next phase of human evolution. They are naturally telepathic, telekinetic and can teleport (jaunte). They are also in possession of an alien supercomputer ""TIM"" explicitly capable of original thought and a hideout with advanced technology. uThey also have the handicap of not being able to kill even in self defense. Despite this, they have numerous adventures with human and alien bad guys and have become the acknowledged (by the ""Galactic Federation"") autority of Earth though almost no one knows about them.I found the series enjoyable but a little campy. There is also a couple of points where the characters take actions which arguably are inconsistant with a prohibition on killing (like sabotaging a spacehip)."
4,Howlingly Funny,"I adored this series as a kid and didn't expect it to have aged well. It hasn't but it's still entertaining. What's even more entertaining is the commentary included for ""The Secret Weapon."" It's almost worth the purchase price, not for any particular insights into the filming of the series but for high humor.Nicholas Young, Peter Vaughn-Clarke and Ann Curthoys reminisce over a series they hadn't seen in thirty years, all of them rather abashed that they'd had anything to do with the project. Nicholas Young in particular is ribald and contemptuous but since he's laughing at himself, you can't help laughing along with him. At times, things get a bit like Mystery Science Theater 3000. A good-natured moderator attempts to keep order, fails utterly and gives up entirely by the end. Wish they had done a commentary for every episode! (Commentary gets at least a PG13 rating for language and sexual innuendo.)"
2,The tomorrow People,The tomorrow people is a 1960's style sci fi. Everything is peace related and child like. A child might be able to get through the show.
1,Never Received ITEM!,"This item was a gift to a sick boy in the hospital.I ordered it on a three day rush.The boy NEVER received the item, there is no record of it being shipped and not only is he not in the hospital anymore but when they tried to reship the item his size was sold out!!!I had a very good experience dealing directly with this company once before but not this time when dealing with AMAZON!Very disappointed. So was the sick boy!"
3,Please no more DVD/Blu-ray combos!!!,"Can't comment on the image quality, but as with all Shout Factory releases, no doubt it's top notch. As for the movie, loads of retro 50s sci-fi fun. As for the packaging, please offer DVD and Blu-Ray separately, which is why I'm knocking off a couple of stars. If the Blu-Ray can't sell on its own, don't force it on us. Some of us have been collecting DVDs for years and want the option to buy the DVD in standard DVD packaging. If have no interest in Blu-Ray and even if the price is comparable, I just don't want it."
5,Combo packs,"This is to the reviewer above. Who the heck doesn't have a blu-ray player by now, they're under $100 now for heavens sake. If you don't want it don't buy it, the price will come down after it;s been out for a while anyway. I personally have a dvd player and a blu-ray player and love these combo packs i wish they would do more of them. Keep up the good work Shout Factory you're awesome. If you've neer seen the movie buy it as soon as possible it's one of the best killer insect movies out there period."
2,Chilton's Manual,"Bought this manual to help fix an electrical problem with my keyless entry/memory seats/auto lights. The manual covers mechanical repairs in the most detail. Has a black box approach to the wiring, but does not cover the Limited version which has the memory functions. Does not have the locations of the different control modules identified and calls some of the modules different names than the Ford manuals."
3,Not Mercury Mountain V8 specific,Doesnt fully cover Mercury Mountaineer. Not a single picture of Mountaineer included. Both are slightly different.
3,I would not watch it again,Welcome to skull mountain where the dead still walk the earth. It is here that the last will and testament of a deceased voodoo priestess brings together her four remaining relatives.
1,The Best From Broadway Musicals - Original Cast,"I bought this for my wife who is a big Broadway Musical Fan. One of our favorites is ""ONE MORE ANGEL IN HEAVEN"" I played this first for her, and we were both disgusted to hear some cheesey instumental version, rather than the original sung version. The description of the CD said ""Original Cast"". Turns out only a few of the songs are by the original cast, the rest are instrumentals, the like of which you can hear in any elevator and dentist office in the land."
1,Not that great,"I got these CDs some time ago, and I was very disappointed in them. Of the three, the Andrew Lloyd Webber one is the best. The other two are not much good at all. I once thought you couldn't go wrong with Rodgers & Hammerstein, but these CDs proved me wrong. Even the ALW CD isn't very good. Most of the songs are instrumental, and those that are sung aren't sung that well. If you're thinking about getting these CDs, I'd suggest thinking again. I find that for the most part, the CDs that are called ""The Very Best of..."" tend to be big letdowns--at least those I've listened to. The only exception I've found so far is ""The Very Best of Andrew Lloyd Webber: The Broadway Collection."" If you want an excellent ALW collection, that's the one to get. Not this one."
1,Weak voices and muddy music.,"The Andrew Lloyd Webber disk is a poor imitation of the origional cast performances; the two other disks are instramentals: no voices at all.Not a good choice for anyone who likes origional cast recordings of Broadway shows; and, if sold as such these CDs will be a big disappointment."
5,great for learning Spanish; nice translation,"I bought this book in order to learn Spanish. (I chose this title because I've read it in English about 100 times.) The translation was excellent: the prose was vivid and the Spanish was kept at the same reading level as the English original. The compelling story kept my interest even though I had to slog through with a dictionary and a grammar reference at first. By the end of the book I was just reading, only using the dictionary occasionally. It's a wonderful story, a great translation, and thus an excellent learning tool."
3,Good for beginning Spanish speakers but I preferred reading Harry Potter in Spanish,This classic book is quite good for beginning Spanish speakers but I preferred reading the Harry Potter books in Spanish.
4,Un buen libro por los estudiantes intermedios,"Estoy estudiando español, y quería un libro que era a la vez fácil para leer e interesante. Muchos de los libros para los adultos eran demasiado difíciles para mí, debido al vocabulario extenso más que la gramática, y los libros para los niños eran demasiado aburridos. También traté de leer otros libros exclusivamente para los principiantes, pero que eran muy repetitivos. Este libro es perfecto para mí.No soy un hablante nativa, así que no determinar la exactitud de la traducción. Sin embargo, puedo decir con certeza que es un buen libro por los estudiantes intermedios.(Lo siento por los errores en la gramática. Todavía estoy practicando español. Yo escribí este artículo en español para que otros pudieran determinar mi nivel de habilidad con el idioma.)"
2,Did not last,Lasted six months with light use. Did not hold a charge. Cheap and you get what you paid for. Not recommended.
5,Needed something to support my ankles,I like a high top shoe for power walking & bicycling that does not look like a tennis shoe. Comfortable & gives support I need. Was initially concerned about height soles add to the shoe; however the stability is fine & supports my weak ankles.
4,Trail Meister?,"If the buyer is in Afghanistan or Iraq, I would not recommend these boots. I bought them and they fell apart on me within a month, the Afghanistan heat, weather and terrain, destroyed them quickly. Other then that, the shoes were quite comfortable and probably would have had a better life expectancy in a different environment."
2,"Nice sports shoes, But...","Seem skids in the water, is ot slip, thats mean that if you are with the humid floor, maybe you will broken head in the floor. For another side, is ok for mountains, only if this last is dry."
2,self-criticism,"I am the author of this book. It has a few good scenes, but is essentially ""roman a clef"" nonsense that every writer has to get out of his system early on. Do yourself a favor and read ANYTHING else I've written (you'll be doing me a favor, too). Forgive the follies of youth."
2,Not very helpful and practical,It doesn't provide details on how to value intangibles. It promotes a stock approach for intangible asset measuring but lacks the comprehensiveness of methodologies that use a flow approach. I didn't find this much help in my line of work as a business manager for a multinational organisation. I needed more practical examples and found the arguments weak and unsubstantiated. There seemed to be a lack in practical application and his arguments seemed not to be tested.
1,How to Draw Cars and Trucks,It came in the mail all bent up. I decided not to give it for a gift because it looked used. The sender needs to mail it in a container that will keep this from happening.
3,Badfinger's Last Album,"This was Badfinger's last album, which was released in 1981. Original members Joey Molland (guitar & vocals) and Tom Evans (bass & vocals) were joined by Tony Kaye (keyboards), Glenn Sherba (guitar), and Richard Bryans (drums). This isn't a great album, but it has its moments. I really like ""I Got You"" and ""Hold On"". ""Passing Time"" and ""No More"" are pretty good songs as well. If you're a Badfinger fan, you'll probably want to download this album."
3,Great To Finally Have This on CD,"Say No More is one of my favorite Badfinger Albums, one that I wore out years ago. My only concern, is that it sounds like this CD was taken from vinyl. Are the Master tapes lost ?"
5,Track Listing,Side One1. I Got You 3:392. Come On 3:233. Hold On 3:244. Because I Love You 2:485. Rock N' Roll Contract 5:36Side Two6. Passin Time 3:307. Three Time Loser 3:308. Too Hung Up On You 3:219. Crocadillo 4:2910. No More 3:21
5,Great Purchase,"This battery works very well. Just as good if not better than the actual Makita battery. They are all overpriced in my opinion, but this one is about $15.00 cheaper than OEM. It is made in Japan, not China like other replacements. This does matter. Japan (Panasonic) leads the world in battery quality and technology. Bottom line....The battery is worth the price."
3,Short lived,"Did not live as long as the OEM battery. Worked great for several months, then refused to take a charge. Had to go to the store and buy an OEM replacement, and over a year later, I'm still using that one."
5,International shipments,"I am down in Brasil and my old batteries died long ago.Replacements here are extremely costly, prohibitive, in fact. However, Amazon.com does NOT ship this item international.I am really surprised ![...]Thank you."
3,seems like a keeper,what can I say since it isn't for me but an older freind that couldn't get his drill to work without a new battery
5,Waltzes,I love this Waltz CD because it is so relaxing. This is my favorite kind of music to listen to. I could sit and listen to it for hours and often do.I also love dancing to it. One of the best CD's I have. Amazon is amazing for their choices in music.
2,Where's the code?,"Sorry, this book is great if you are a drag and drop type of web programmer. I think it is great that visual studio allows the ability to virtually drag and drop and entire data driven website. But my problem is that if you don't understand the code behind it, when something breaks you can't fix it since I am unaware of any drag and drop tools that do that for you.My point being this book should have been titled. ""asp.net with c# only using the free visual web developer IDE for people who don't want to know what the c# code really looks like or how to write programs with it.""The only reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1 is because my gripes aside, they do enforce a lot of Best Practice in the excercises."
1,For Beginner's Book It's Full of Errors,I just started using this book and have already had problems with Chapter 1. The other two reviewers are correct when stating that the directories mentioned don't even exist. It's full of other errors too. I visited the publisher's website hoping it would be easy to just find all the errata listed on one page but it only lists a small amount of the errata. The rest of the errors are pointed out in the publisher's forums by upset readers. Many of these posts aren't even responded to for months by any of the authors. You should at least read the forums and the publisher's website before buying this book.
4,Woods' 2nd best film is a rarity,"James Woods' 2nd best movie (after ""The Onion Field"") is a superb Dramedy. In it we get all of Woods' charm without even a hint of his usual psycho roles. Alan Arkin is hysterical as Joshua's father, and the screenwriting throughout is first-rate! Some may find the focus a bit too jewish, but give it a chance, and you'll enjoy this very likeable film. I like it so much, I had to buy a used VHS rental tape to get it. If it comes out on DVD, I'll buy it again."
2,Not for Everyone,I purchased this to put on top of my car's leather seat for comfort and protection of the leather. This is not for cars with leather seats. By the time I sat in the car the cushion had shifted to the point of being uncomfortable. It simply would not stay in place. The strap that goes over the back of the seat slid all the way down and the other two straps for the bottom of the seat were useless. I got so fed up I ended up tossing it in the back seat and now my dog seems to love it!
2,Not as good as I expected.,It can not be fixed to the seat tightly. I think in summer I will remove it.
3,More works needed,"I bought 2 , one from Amazon and one from local auto parts store. They are comfy and look good but the straps are worthless. I had to make straps by myself and the covers turned out very good . Without putting new and stronger straps the covers will never work. They keep shifting around . I will not recommend for anyone who do not or can not using sewing machine ."
4,Pretty good horror flick from Roger Coreman,"This is worth at least 4 stars. When survivors of a worldwide plague, rescue a lone woman,they soon find out a shocking discovery:she's pregnant...and it's not a human! Now they must fight a desperate deadly battle against the ever-growing, ever bolder mutant. It stars George Kennedy and Andrew Stevens."
1,The Originality Lacking Within,"This movie is a direct cross of Alien and The Beast Within. Alien, a great Sci-Fi flick, had the birth and rapid growing which was poorly repeated in this flick. The Beast Within (notice the title similarity), which was a decent horror movie for it time, has the same theme of a monster trying to mate with every woman it comes across. They took two good movies and made one pretty bad one. The low budget definitely didn't help. The ""Gargoyle"" reminded me of Godzilla. A rubbery suit that was too big for the guy wearing it. Water, or some sort of goo/liquid sprayed on the suit would have helped - looked too dry. I will give it 1 star for gore though."
2,What Terror?,"The Terror Within is a Roger Corman produced monster flick that is a cut or two below some of his previous monster flicks, such as Humanoids From The Deep and Piranha. It takes a while to really get going, and when it does get going it's still not that great. The monster looks silly, and the gore is minimal when compared with Humanoids From The Deep. There is also no nudity, which is rare for an 80's B-movie that was produced by Corman. There are some cool moments here and there, but not enough to make this movie worth seeing. I'm glad I watched this on netflix, instead of buying it."
3,Another Corman Classic!...,"Yes, THE TERROR WITHIN is yet one more ALIEN rip-off. It's set in an underground facility in the desert instead of a ship in deep space, but the basic plot is the same: Hideous creature on the loose kills off the humans one by one. In this movie we get a belly-bursting alien birth scene (sound familiar?), a fetal alien in the air-vents, and a full grown monster (aka: a guy in a rubber suit w/ gnarly dentures) running amok. Andrew Stevens (The Fury) and George Kennedy (Naked Gun) star in this pulse-pounding epic. Well, my pulse didn't actually pound, but I did get a slight headache. Anyway, TTW is a pretty good little movie to watch on a dull day. I was modestly entertained and not once did I want to smash my TV..."
2,Okay but no big deal,Another from YogaFit - seen better for sure - not impressed with yogafit - Oh the instructors are okay but there are much better yoga dvds - check out Peggy Cappy - after using many yoga DVDs I like Peggy Cappy the Best Yogafit are amaturish.
4,"Tragic heroines, knights in tweed armor, and cereal conventions.","Okay, let me first say that I loved that we didn't just leave Unity Kinkaid hanging off the side of a cliff, as Gaiman tends to do with his other tragic characters. I want to thank you for that personally.Rose Walker's story is a move in the utterly real direction, despite the fact that the motives of some characters are fantastical. The whole time reading the novel, you're realizing the truth of this because people are actually as mentally unbalanced as these characters. On the other hand, Gaiman throws in a support group-like ""cereal"" convention which sort of plays fun with the fact that these people are tormented. Sue me, but I liked it.Traditional roles are presented and while his wit isn't the most original, the overall plot is captivating and cool."
5,So awesome!,"While this book isn't quite as good as Prologues and Nocturnes, it tells a story that is almost just as good, and was actually the first Sandman graphic novel to be published, though it covers issues #9-#16. You will probably only be reading this if you've already read Preludes and Nocturnes, and really no review would matter to you at this point, becuase you are hooked. Go ahead and buy this and Dream Country together, because you're going to fly through this one."
4,"Very, very good","A house full of eccentrics. A voyage into an abused boy's imagination. A convention of serial killers. A man who just won't die. A vortex of dreams. This book shows the Sandman series shaping up very good. Finally, comic books are living up to their potential."
4,Far above average,"I enjoy some graphic novels -- not the standard ""Marvel"" type but those with original content and approach, and Gaiman is about as original as they come. This is the first of the ""Sandman"" series I've read and I was quite taken with both the story and the art, though it seems to suffer (as so many graphic novels do) from narrative discontinuity. The Prologue, ""Tales in the Sand,"" is a memorable retelling of what purports to be an African tribal legend, ""Collectors"" is a terror tale that will jangle your nerves, and the six centuries of ""Men of Good Fortune"" is worth the price of admission all by itself."
5,"NOT FOR ""UNMATURE"" READERS","The only thing that would do fair justice to this book it's not fancy words about the psychologic insights of mr Gaiman's writting style...or the state of the art artwork gracefully diplayed here....or the baudelerian dialogos betwen the characters...no the only thing that could do justice to this book is that giant ""wwwwwwwwwooooooowwww"" exclamation when you are reading the book and the final words given to it ""it was incredible"" and that's it"
2,Dissapointing,"I liked 'Preludes & Nocturnes' a lot (minus the superheros) but this was really bland. The overall story is a great idea but all the subplots that make up the story just seem like filler or a reason to be shocking. I missed all the demons and magic of 'Preludes...'. I really hope this series gets better, I had really high hopes for it."
5,BETTER THAN THE FIRST,I was very pleased with the first book but I felt the story was lacking a bit of direction. This book absolutely blew me away. It is like nothing I have ever experienced before. The art complements the epic story quite nicely. I highly suggest you pick up this series. Be warned it is extremely weird and has some evil moments in it as well.
3,"Good, but not great!","I am an avid listener of big band music. I know what original recordings sound like, and these are NOT the original recordings. Although the music is still nice, and these were performed by good musicians, I can still hear and notice the obvious difference from the originals. It just doesn't have the smoothness and ""swing & sway"" associated with the ""real thing."" It's a decent collection, but I prefer original recordings, with the original sound."
2,Disappointed!,"Being a fan of big bands, I looked forward to playing this CD set, especially the Glenn Miller portion. Unfortunately, I am familiar with Glenn Miller and these renditions were poor imitations. The notes on the box gave no hint as to who made the recordings. Other than a brief mention that the CDs were ""made in Canada,"" I have no idea of the recording artists. But I strongly suspect that they are NOT original recordings, and NOT the latter day Glenn Miller band. This CD set is just okay. But, for a few dollars more I would prefer the ""real thing."" Color me ""Disappointed!"""
5,Great CD-set,"This Box Set is a very valuable one (3 CDs for the price of 1 and what Cds!) and it contains some of the biggest moments in swing jazz, the genre I've just begun to explore. I think it is a very good starting point for all who aren't into the genre yet but want to know more about it. Before listening to this set I only knew ""Take the A-Train"", ""Chu-Chu"" and some standard classics but this opens the horizon and makes me want to know more about swing jazz."
1,Garbage!,"I bought this cd set over ten years ago as one of my first big band cd purchases. I was only a young man at the time and didn't realize that this was NOT the original recordings. Sound quality is terrible- yea even flat at times, and also the Glenn Miller tunes sound nothing like the originals- no vocals. It sounds like it was recorded by a cheap tape recorder at the way back of the auditorium at a concert. Tonite after I get home from work, this piece of trash is going to the dump instead of donated to Goodwill- it would be wrong of me to sucker first-time listeners of big band to this knockoff. My late grandpa's old 78s of these songs sound way better."
2,Glenn Miller Big Band CD Sans Vocals NG,"Disappointing. This ""Glenn Miller"" CD has no vocals (like Tex Beneke and the Modernaires on its Chattanooga Choo Choo cut). Makes you doubt it really is the Glenn Miller Band."
5,iris indoor beauty,"great plant, read up on it today, i cant wait for it to grow and bloom. i understand it doesnt have many leafs but the ones it does have are healthy and the leafs are very nice. kind of mini iris leafs. iris are my favorite and i do not have a yard so here is one for raising in your home. have a friend whos had one for 15 years but never knew what it was called. enjoy"
2,Small,"I ordered two, one died, the other doesn't look good. I was very disappointed in the health of the plants."
3,House Plant,I haven't tried this plant before and hopefully will keep it growing. At present it seems to be struggling but growing slowly.
3,Confused,"Would have been much better if they would have just told the story in order. Instead they tried to make some confusing ""artful"" Grand Theif Auto type of movie."
2,actionman,very disappointed with this movie I guess Van Damn is getting too old to act for more then a few minutes
4,Correction to above review,"I've never actually seen this film, but I thought I'd correct the above review concerning the island upon which Pat Conroy actually taught. The schoolhouse was (and still is) the Mary Fields Schoolhouse on Daufuskie Island and there is no bridge. Daufuskie is accessible only by ferry."
5,A little-known classic starring the young John Voight,"Based on Pat Conroy's autobiographical novel ""The Water is Wide"", this seldom-seen film is well deserving of a DVD issue from the only current available VHS release of this 1974 film starring a very young John Voight in the lead role. Set during the height of the Vietnam War, he plays a teacher sent to a tiny island elementary school, where he finds a group of young black students deemed as ""slow"" by their parents and peers, the principal in charge of the school, and his great nemesis, the school superintendant, brilliantly played by Hume Cronyn, who ultimately fires him for his insubordination in teaching the kids too well. Definitely one of Voight's greatest roles ever, this beautiful film should not be missed."
5,One of the best.....,"I have watched my Jon Voight VHS version of this movie for years and itis one of the best ever so moving true life stories of such a dedicated teacher. The ending is a tear jerker even as many times as I have watched it. As another rater mentioned, I would love to seeactor Jon Voights version on DVD before my tape wears out!"
3,More like 2.5 but since I love the genera....,I have always thought that there is nothing worse that can happen to a song then to see it replaced by some kind of easy listening version. There is nothing wrong with this album if you need something to play in the background while you are doing something else but I didn't find this experience enjoyable at all.If you like Celtic Music this isn't something you want to listen to. This is Celtic Lite not entirely surprising because I found this at a Cracker Barrel but that is no excuse. Any other album by any other group playing the Celtic Standards is better.
5,Wish I had bought 3 more.,I bought this collection on the one day email special in March for $89.99. I wish I had bought three more for friends. I love the packaging...YES! I cannot believe all these people complaining about this in their reviews. I thought it was very nice packaging but I focused my attention on the quality of the movies with their restoration. I have viewed them and if you love Bond this is a must. I saw my first Bond movie..Goldfinger in 1964 with my Dad. This collection is well done and it will make a very nice gift for your buddies. I will buy more when Amazon runs the email special again. I did enjoy the reviews at Amazon..many of them loved this collection like me...for those of you who have complained about the packaging...you are wrong!
3,Should come with a opening credit cd/dvd,Im considering getting this. It would of been even more awesome if it had a cd with all the opening credit songs on it or a DVD with just music videos playing of the opening.. James bond had some awesome songs
3,Be Careful,"Some discs were scratched, last disc which is a music CD, had a crack in it. Be careful with the packaging, hard to take discs out of their holders.Watched Dr. No and it skipped throughout....be careful if it says new when buying. Checked the rest of the discs and the seemed to look ok"
4,"Excellent Digital Remastering, Less than Premium Packaging","I purchased this James Bond Ultimate Collector's Set as a Christmas present in 2007. It cost about $110 back then. I was disappointed in the ""less than premium"" thin and flimsy box, slim DVD cases, and disorganized contents. In my opinion, the presentation of this collector's set by MGM/UA is disrespectful to the James Bond legacy. They could have at least packaged the 21 movies in release date order. OK, I'm through venting. I do give MGM/UA credit for the exceptional digital remastering of the films. I am especially impressed by the resulting viewing pleasure of the Sean Connery films. My wife says that 007 never looked better. And I have to agree."
4,Great series - bad organization,"While the collection is great, the way they they are organized is horrendous. Most reasonable people would organize them according to release date, these seem to be grouped randomly. There are five films per volume, 4 volumes and it's a real hodge podge the way they're organized. Too bad Broccoli hasn't re-made ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". Lazenby is atrocious and the story deserves Brosnan, or Craig. ( Sean is too old unfortunately )( Moore was only just passable.) All in all, with some reservations, worth the price."
5,Looks like it is just repackaged from the 4 volumes earlier this year.,"I looked at this set in the store today and it really appears as if the contents actually are the 4 Ultimate Collectors Volumes inside this case with Craig's Casino Royale along side. And by the contents being the 4 Volumes, literally, it looks like they are inside this black box.I opted for the Ulimate Collector's Bundle for $179, instead of this, since I purchased Casino Royale when it was released, and I am really just looking for all the previous movies from Connery to Brosnan in the remastered 2-disc versions.Also of note, if you want all the Bond films- you have to order Never Say Never Again as a separate item, that is not part of the MGM/UA library."
4,Region 1 is Shortchanged Again,"I am deducting 1 star because the packaging is not worthy of the ultimate James Bond set.While Europe and parts of Asia get the stunning attache case box set, the US and Canada get only a cardboard box. OK. A shiny cardboard box.Inclusion of Casino Royale, notwitstanding.Are you listening, MGM?"
2,unhappy,Three of the DVDs are bad and I can not get anyone to help me get a replacement for them. I am unhappy and very disappointed.
3,James Bond Ultimate Collector's Set,"What a shame. Probably one of the most well known series ever presented and the marketing people can't get it right. Flimsy boxing, could have at least put them in order of when released. Is missing one. Amazon, with all of your buying power you should be able to help them get it right."
2,Never Say Never Again is not included,"I bought this set a while ago. Today I realized that movie was not included. It was silly of me, thinking that the ultimate collection included all the movies."
2,Titling and info wrong,"Since there are other 'Bond Collections' that actually do have the movies and etc listed instead of 'vol 1' etc... and do it correctly, this collection will not be bought.The others are as nice as this one for nearly the same price (cheaper usually)."
5,Bond-afide Happiness,My family and I have been Bond fans for years. So I finally broke down and bought this packaged set for my husband as an anniversary gift. Needless to say he loved it. So we decided to get one for his dad as well for his anniversary. No complants. Of course I would recommend this as an ideal gift for any Bond fan.
4,cheap cases,cheap plastic cases for a great collection? Could have gone for a little more quality considering the price.
4,Bond Collectors set,"This was an awesome steal of $90 on their Goldbox page. Too bad it doesn't contain ""Never Say Never""."
5,Great!!!,"Great delivery time. Item recieved in excellent condition, will do service with seller again."
3,Has no one noticed???,"Great collection, bummer about the packaging. But NO ONE NOTICED OR COMMENTED ON the fact that the last Sean Connery ""Never say Never Again"" is not part of the Collection??? What fool would not add the last time Connery played this role?"
2,You can buy them cheaper seperetle,"Great content, but you can buy the individual james bond ultimate colletions vol 1,2,3,4 for around $120, its just stupid to pay this much for them"
3,It's missing one,"This box is missing Never Say Never Again!!! The box is pretty --- pretty heavy and flimsy. I got rid of the box and put the DVDs in my cases. Since I am not one for Special features, I got rid of them too. I don't want to know how the movie was made - that takes all the fun out of it for me. I got it as a gift so . . . The cases were thin too.It is also missing Quantum of Solace but I think that was made AFTER the box came out so I have to order them separately."
5,A must have collection for 007 geeks..,"I have since my early childhood been a great fan of the James Bond movies. Sure they are sometimes over the top, but that's exactly what James Bond is all about imho.This Ultimate Collectors set has all the movies, in a rather cheap packaging, but my main focus is on the content and not the packaging. The movies are all in pristine technical quality - some of course are better than others - with ""Casino Royale"" as my favorite and ""Diamonds are forever"" as a close second.I have yet to go through all the 21 extra bonus DVD's, so those I can't comment on yet.I would definitely recommend this box set to all true OO7 fans."
4,The Original James Bond,"Three and a half stars, for MGM keeps overlooking the original James Bond in the original version of Casino Royale. Barry Newman was James Bond in the original T.V. version of Casino Royale broadcast in B&W in the late 1950s. This was a pretty fair intrepretation given the limited budget, restrictive time alloted and archaic equipment. This, along with the 'Bond' attache case would fully complete the real 'ULTIMATE BOND COLLECTION'."
2,Complete Set? Really? Hardly!,"Aw excuse me but the term Complete set lends on to believe All the Bond movies are there. My Kids thought so and bought me this set. But after I watched them I asked ""Where is the one with Barbra in it?"" ( Kim is in it as well) It is not listed on the box and not included. So ""Never say never again"" is not a Bond movie? Hardly, The box set is missing a Sean Connery movie and the people selling it Lied.I believe this is false advertising. Really Sad."
3,Box,This is a bit of a rip off. I purchased the whole new set last year. Now they re issue it again with a box? Ripp Off. They should offer the box for sale for those of us who already shelled out $250.00 for the set.
5,For the Bond fans,"This is an excellent set containing all the Bond movies since Dr. No. See Sean Connery at his best, a must-have for any Bond fanatic."
3,missing movie!,I thought this was supposed to be the ultimate collectors set of james bond movies! Very dissappointed to find the 1983 'Never say never again' MISSING from the collection
2,SCRATCHED DISCS!,"Awesome job remastering these discs, but unfortunately 12 out of 21 movies had either disc 1 (movie), 2 (special features) or both significantly scratched. Sent for an exchange, so will see how the new set works out."
5,Greatest deal ever!,"I havent watched my dvd's as of yet but when I saw this limited time special deal of the entire collection for under $100 I had to get it!So when the cold winter comes a knockin I fully intend to kick back, pop some popcorn and enjoy all 21 of the James Bond movies."
5,Ultimate Bond Experience,"I am a big fan of the Bond franchise. I have read all of the novels and seen most of the films. However it had been awhile since I had seen them and even then I watched them when TBS did 007 Days of Bond. Needless to say I had not seen many of the earlier Bond films as they should be seen.This edition fixes that problem. This is the way that Bond should be viewed. The movies look fantastic and the special features are over abundant. So far I have made my way through the first wave of Sean Connery films and I hope to watch ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" this weekend. The sound is quite impressive and the film looks great. I highly recommend this set to anyone who enjoys watching our favorite super spy."
4,Excellent deal.,"21 Films in one edition, it's great and the special features are great as well. My set had a serious flaw on the disc for GoldenEye but I'm sure they'll replace that one disc for me (I hope). Also, it would be nice if they had Casino Royale matching the same format as the rest of the discs and with the special features, other than that it's great."
5,"Love Bond Movies, this is for you!!!","This is an awesome collection of movies, contains all Bond movies up to date. All movies have been redone to include better video and 5.1 Surround Sound so even all the old Bond movies look better. A must have for James Bond fans."
5,awesome,"not more to say than what already has been said. but this set (i actually have the 4 5 disc/box sets) has the best sound and picture ever for a JB dvd. playing through my oppo dv-981HD upconvert dvd player on my samsung HDTV set, the picture is simply amazing"
5,Full series,Includes all the bond films completely restored to dvd quality. I wish they would have ordered the movies from first to last or last to first rather than just bunching volumes 1-4 together. movies are scattered through them
2,Okay Knives,"My grandmother owned these knives and I inherited one. I love the one she had for years. I'm not sure the new ones are made the same way. They hold an edge and sharpen pretty easily and well. However, the ones I purchased rust in a disappointing way."
5,Chief,Chicago is great knives for the dollar spent. I would not have any other in my KitchenBest value in knives on the market
4,Good for the price,"A good starter set for any new cook. The walnut handles are quite sturdy and beautiful. The blades are quite sharp and are full tang. The only thing- I wish the paring knife's blade was a little curved, but that is because I have gotten used to using the Wusthof curved paring knife and it is good for peeling everything. Good for the price and best of all- it comes with a lifetime guarantee too. Being a knife nerd who does not have the money to spend it on blades- this brand is good way to start off and complement your knife collection."
5,Chicago Cutlery Walnut Tradition 3-Piece Prep Knife Gift Set,"I bought this for a gift, so don't know if it's the same quality as my 25 year old CC chef's and utility knives. If they are, my daughter should be still using them years from now.No dishwasher, and keep the handles oiled with mineral oil. Mine still look almost like new and I use them a lot!"
5,I was blown away,"I have owned a few ""ten dollar knives"" that were ok, but they were not like THESE. I bought these knives because it resemble my moms (she's 65) old war club (her wood handled 10 inch chefs knife). I was worried I wouldn't like the size of the 8inch, but I really can't feel much of a difference. People complain about the discoloration, but my moms old knife is all kinds of shades of blue, so I don't care. Hand dry and do it fast. The pairing knife is the BEST snacking knife ever (hard salami and cheese). The filet knife is not AS useful for me, but sharp and sturdy, throw it in your camping/tack box. I've had ""shinny knives"" that don't cut for beans, these aren't that shiny, but they cut! Buy 2 if the price is right. I then bought theChicago Cutlery Essentials 2-Piece Partoku Knife/Santoku Knife Set, Sheath Packagingalso and it's great too, but I prefer this set"
3,knife review,"The quality of the wood handles is very poor, actually got a sliver taking it out of the package."
3,"Decent, for the price","Bought these, a sharpening steel and a filet knife for my friend's place in Hawaii. I stay there for a time each year and got sick and tired of the serrated stuff he had in the place. These will take and hold an edge, are built fairly heavily, seem quite durable. I had a set a number of years ago until I bought my Henckles.Will they compete with the German made Henckles? No, but then again they cost less than a tenth of what the Henckles would have. For the price they are a bargain."
4,Much better than Porky's 2!,"Porky's Revenge marks the return of Porky and his establishment.This time Porky has a casino on a riverboat and the basketball coach owes a great debt to Porky.To clear his debt the coach has agreed to throw the State Championship game.Tommy,Pee Wee,and Meat are back as well as the rest of their buddies.Much more entertaining than Porky's 2.The graduation part is great too.If you liked the first Porky's movie check this one out."
4,Come celebrate the Year of the Pig,"Most of the gang from Angel Beach High is back, and they're preparing for graduation. Trouble abounds when their basketball coach gets in hock with Porky over gambling debts, and is ordered to throw the state championship game-or else. In between tangling with their old nemesis, the boys ""help"" Meat pass his biology exam by blackmailing the teacher, Pee-Wee becomes enamored of Inga, the attractive exchange student from Sweden, and they're still locking horns with the diabolical Ms. Balbricker. Lots of fun for fans of the series. I've heard rumors about a fourth movie but nothing definite yet. Veteran TV director James Komack took over direction from Bob Clark and does a good job, adding a different kind of look for this sequel. Recommended."
1,porkey's revenge,i saw dvd in the title then when i got the bill it showed vhs... who the hell has vhs tapes anymore? i complained and they wanted me to pay the fee to return the item... no thanks... i rather throw it in the trash cause it was cheaper to do so.
3,A STEP UP FROM THE LAST ONE,"THIS TIME, PORKY AND HIS NIGHTCLUB [WHICH IS NOW ON A BOAT] RETURNS. THE BASKETBALL COACH OWES MONEY TO PORKY, TO CLEAR HIS DEBT, HE AGREES TO PURPOSELY LOSE THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP. THIS ONE IS A LITTLE SOFTER IN TERMS OF THE NUDITY THAT THE FIRST TWO. THIS WAS A BIG IMPROVEMENT OVER PORKY'S 2 AND IT'S UP THERE WITH PORKY'S 1. FOR A GOOD FUN TIME, CHECK THIS SEQUEL OUT."
1,Review of The Girl Next Door,"I liked how they don't know that they are all wrong about the mystery,and it takes them a long time to figure that out."
2,Over priced,Not a bad dvd but a little over priced. I would say $15 to $20 max would be a good price. The drills are well explained and fairly easy and they explain how to do them well. The male swimmer swam a little too aggressively and churned the water too much making it hard to see the stroke. The female swimmer was a little smoother and it was easy to see her stroke and technique.They do stress to use the drills you want and make them work for your stoke. In other words there are more than one way to do a good stroke.Laurie
2,Not Worth It.,"I bought this cable to de-ice my gutter. It barely clears a 1/16"" channel for runoff. Don't waste your money. Get the good stuff. Raychem Guardian is the best of the pre-made cables but is much more costly."
1,The yucky beast of Yucca Flats,"A fat old Russian scientist (Tor Johnson) defector with moon pictures gets irradiated Yucca Flats. He becomes a scaly that with a penchant for girl necks. We spend the next 54 minutes watching people running around saying kill them all and let God sort them out.Most of the film is narrated if that's what you can call it. A side benefit is that we get a chance to see what 1961 cars, cloths, haircuts, and sleazy women (Lanell Cado ... Woman Strangled in Opening Scene) look like.The opening scene was tacked on at a later date. If you are lucky, you can get a copy of a topless Lanell Cado. Moreover, just who is the stand in for Tor Johnson in that scene?Them! (Snap Case) ~ James Whitmore"
1,A cheesy production not even worth the $1 I spent.,"The production value of this little ""gem"" is poor to say the least. Unless all the footage is pre-1980, the quality of the scenes are very poor in quality. The voice-over is bland and monotonous. Even the obligatory music is of lousy recorded quality. If only Amazon allowed a negative stars rating I would have given that instead."
2,Manager's powerpoint,"There are some good ideas on this book, but most of it looks like a manager's meeting powerpoint presentation. There is Too much common sense and simple diagrams. I really expected more."
3,Different,"I found these discs to be different and interesting. They get kind of repetative after a while though, but I like the change of pace. I suppose if I was more into this kind of music I may have a more positive reaction!"
2,decent (real) chants but a repackaging,"Yet another cheap repackaging of an earlier, better CD box set, the 4 CD ""A Treasury of Gregorian Chants."" Bad form. They should find new music (or, better yet, discover old recordings) instead of cashing in on the same few recordings repeatedly and dishonestly."
5,Yay!,"Didn't come with the case or booklet but I was aware of that when I bought it. Love the game, no hiccups or problems and cheap price! Thanks!"
2,"An easy, predictable video game","When I saw ads in magazines and commercials for Ape Escape 2, I knew that this game would be fun and cute. Well, I was only right about one thing: It's cute. It turned out to be an easy and predictable game with no twists and turns whatsoever. If you did like Ape Escape, then you'd probably enjoy the storyline of this one. But it has poor controls, and it is the most predictable game I have ever played. It has horrible voices (think Pokemon all over again), and even worse controls. If you liked Ape Escape, you may want to rent this one. Overall, Ape Escape 2 was no big surprise."
4,Ape Escape 2 for PS2,"I bought this game for my four year old daughter. She got hooked on the original Ape Escape for Playstation One. Unfortunatly, SHE has been showing ME how to play!! That's how good she is. She only needs help occasionally from an adult. This game is rated E for everyone, and the rating fits.I'd recommend this game for anyone who is looking for but can't find an age appropriate game for their children ages 2 to 5. This is an easy game for that age group to learn good eye/hand coordination.Other games that would work are: Crash Bandicoot, and Spyro the Dragon.Good luck and just have fun."
3,nowhere near as good as ape escape 1,"it's short, easy, and the plot is lame.The plot for the first ape escape was kinda good.This time, Specter is back because the sent the ""monkey helmets"" to the zoo by mistake.Now they have to catch all the monkeys before the professor get's back from vacation.Another thing I can't get over is this pippo-chi character they introduced.Last time I checked, the storyline is a si-fi that takes place in real life.Why the hell is there a weird animal called pippo-chi?!They also have the same voice cast as Ash, Misty, and Professor Oak from pokemon.Maybe pippo-chi is a pikachu remake. Thats really lame!They should have saved time and made a 3D pokemon catching game!!"
5,As much fun as a barrel of monkeys!,"I played Ape Escape 2 many years ago, and when I finally got around to ordering a copy for myself and finishing it I was not disappointed. This game has much better graphics then the first, which is understandable since the first was for the PS1. The storyline is hilarious and all the challenges are so random and fun. I could spend hours playing this game, and it has enough hidden features and games that it's definitely worth playing more than once."
3,Decent but the original is still the best,"Ape Escape 2 is a game where you run around and catch monkeys...that's right son catch monkeys. As weird as that sounds, the game is pretty fun to play and has a unique control scheme.For those who played the PlayStation original, you will be a little disappointed in this sequel. It's just not as fun as the original. The controls have changed slightly and the camera has gotten worse. This is still a very enjoyable game and is at least worth a rental. Ape Escape 3 is coming out and hopefully it will play closer to the original."
5,Just to straighten things out.,"I would like to say this: 1. You don't have to beat the game twice to get Spike back.[yes ,the game just doesn't revolve around Jimmy].You have to return to different levels to get the monkeys you haven't caught yet. 2. Jimmy's voice is not Ash Ketchum. Veronica Taylor [yes,Ash is a girl] had nothing to do with the game. 3. The camera can be reseted by pressing L1. I enjoy this game especially because of the music. There are 51 songs including the Pink Monkey music video, Escape the Ape. Control systems are very original compaired to what is available today. You can walk along with your RC card beside you. I hope this review helps to clear what the game is like."
4,4.5 stars.,"I must admit I had always thought Keb Mo was a little generic as a blues artist until I came across this CD in Scorcese box set. Put it in the CD player just to get a little better idea about where Keb is coming from and man was I surprised. This is really good. His cover of Robert Johnson's ""Come In My Kitchen"" is probably the best cover of this song I have ever heard. ""Henry"" is probably my favorite, just a nice smooth relaxing song. This is a good CD to listen to on summer night, it just sounds like summer to me. All in all I'm glad I gave this CD a chance because now I see Keb is a really great modern blues artist and there aren't many of those around now."
4,It all began with the blues,"A beautiful collection of Kevin Moore's work, a.k.a. Keb' Mo'. This one's got to be the best. I was captivated by it, and hope you will be also."
5,blowing up the rumors!,its been said that all rap sounds the same but G NUTT is showing us all something new and it sounds good! he has a touch of everything on this album for whatever mood your in. i cant wait to hear more from him. continued success to him.....
4,The Album Review,"This album is full of tight songs. There is no let down. Every song hits with some hitting more than others but for the most part this album is excellent for a first release by the artist. The song ""situations"" will be a national hit as well as ""ringin"", ""It's going down"" and a few others. The arrangements are very well prepared and the lyrics are easy to follow with not a whole lot of curse words. This album is a winner."
1,more like again and ag....,bought these batteries as replacement parts for solar patio lights...the original batteries in the lights lasted us about 2 years ...these didn't even last a month :(
2,Not good enough,This may work in low drawing things but was not able to keep up with a portable scanner. I had to purchase some that were 2700mAh. They worked well.
3,Not as good as i thought,"These batteries dont last as long as those i had in my shaver from the manufacturer.Too bad, but its longer then average rechargeable batteries"
1,BEWARE!!!!,I love tow-in surfing and large waves. Don't be fooled by the cover of this DVD. This is terrible!! I was given a copy of this to review and quickly returned it to the surf shop. Almost impossible to sit through and there's very little surfing. Most of this turkey is very lame attempts to be funny - it's only distubing!
1,Buyer Beware!,"This type of video is usually given away free to promote the products. I can't believe I bought it. The problem I bought 2 other tapes by this same company and they are thesam.. Shame, Shame on me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Basic Bungee Set,"This is a light duty bungee cord set that serves its' purpose. If you are looking for a heavy duty set, this would not serve your needs."
3,Disappointing,"I like my hot chocolate to be rich, smooth, loaded with so much chocolate that each sip makes me want to smack my lips to taste each drop. I also use whole milk for my hot chocolate because the fat makes it that much richer. Well, this chocolate mix was disappointing to me. I followed the instructions carefully and when my hot chocolate was ready, the whole experience was not what I had expected. The taste was just okay. It was no more rich or chocolate-y as some of the supermarket brands.Currently, my favorite hot chocolate mix is Organic Sweet Moose Cocoa. In contrast to the Schokinag brand, this one is so rich the chocolate coats the spoon, very smooth and oh so chocolate-y."
3,Drinking Chocolate,"Uh, drinking chocolate? Like, hot chocolate but for $12? Maybe in France that's acceptable, but I really expected to have the top of my head fly off when I drank some of this. Swiss Miss made with milk is comparable and easier. Unless, of course, you like the taste or pretense. Then have at it."
4,"Great book, but not meant for kids","As I have said in the title, this is a great book. The language is fluently written by an amazing author who is able to really capture the pain and agony of being a Filipino during the times of Japanese invasions. It tells the story through a small girl, Yvonne's eyes. How absolutely terrifying everything is and how the war had really impacted the lifestyle of common, everyday, Filipino people. Their struggles to stay alive as the Japanese gain upon them; their worries about the family members that might never return. Though losses were made in the process, Yvoone emerges at the end shining like a star.Dispise all the praises I have had for this book, the four stars as opposed to five were crucial. Some parts in the book where Yvoone accidentally walks in upon her parents I thought was completely unnecessary. I recommend this book to adults, but prehaps the kids can hold it off for a while. Just till they get a little bit older."
4,"Some parts wavered, but story was executed well overall","This reminded me of ""When the Elephants Dance"" by Tess Uriza Holthe, although Brainard's book was published first. The organization of the story felt a bit chaotic, but perhaps that was the author's method of juxtaposing the format with the events occurring in the story. On the other hand, there were moments of poignancy that mentally remain, giving the reader material to philosophize and mull over. Parts of the storyline wavered, but the central storyline was executed overall, and the characters were believable. As a whole, this was an enjoyable read, and I commend the author for being a literary figure for aspiring Fil-Am writers."
4,The Mahound: Purchased at Amazon.com,"The Mahound is about Rory Mahound, the fifth Baron of Sax in Scotland. He was impressed into the navy by a sailor he met in a bar. Among other adventures, he lands some place in Africa, and becomes the adopted brother of a Sultan. I first read this book back in the 1980's and at that age I liked this book a bit better. However, it still is a pretty good read, though with a bit of violence."
5,Hard to find locally,I was excited to find these replacement parts online. They are very hard to find a local hardware stores. Saved me from having to purchase the whole repair kit for the toilet.
1,JJ's Mom,"I owned this dvd on vhs. If I didn't already love it, I would have sent it back. The sound quality is horrible. I also bought silly songs and found the sound just as bad on that one. It is unfortunate because my older kids used to love it and JJ likes it too."
3,Kidsongs vs Wee Sing,"I brough this DVD because it has Hookey Pookey, one of my daughter's favorate song. However, given the choice between Kidsongs and Wee Sing, my daughter prefer Wee Sing. Maybe another year, she would prefer Kidsongs.Secondly, while the price is slightly less than Wee Sing, but only half of the run time (26 minutes for Kids Song vs 58 minutes for Wee Sing). Hence, I am not sure if it is a bargain.Third, autorepeat will run FOREVER. Not sure if I want my daughter to watch a never-ending show..."
3,Thanks Mom!,"My son thanked me for the great songs. He rewind the tape twice or more, each day he watch it.:)"
5,My BEST CD,"This cd is the one of the best cd that I ever had! I recommend this album for everybody who likes the latin music, with a little pop. I think Natalia is the best latin singer. Her first album was very good too, but this is better. I can't write more. If you want to know more about this album, buy the cd!!!! This is very good."
1,A different review,"Have you listened to her singing ""Luna Brava""??? Awful.. horrible! Her voice reminds me of some old records that are reversing in the wrong speed or old casettes that can't play anymore! She is not a singer but just a pretty girl.. she could be a wonderful model but NOT A SINGER!!! Her range is scarcely one octave! She can't even sing in the low C! And as for her style.. it is more pop than latin.. And as for her fans.. She has so many because of Muñeca Brava and of course not her voice!"
4,an interesthing view,I watch muneca brava everyday.I am a chemistry engnering student from TÜRKYE.I listen her cd and like it very much.I thnk she is so talentful as an actres.Her voice is not so powerful but you can enjoy when you listen her.She should make aconcert in TÜRKYE N STANBUL.It's wonderful city.She has so many fans in STANBUL.If NATALA has enough time would be gladful if you send me a mail.We love you.
1,boring/too easy,"this DVD was a big disappointment! it was really boring and way too easy. it might be good if you've just started working out, but even the intermediate levels get old quick. the kickboxing was ok, but it was only 10 min. You would be better off buying the 2nd video in Carmen Electra's Strip sereis called 'Fit to Strip'"
1,Introductory Business Law (CLEP),"I knew all the questions in the book but it did not prepare me for the actual exam. I have used other CLEP study guides and did very well on the exams. This book was not helpful in preparing me for the CLEP. The questions were too easy and it did not include a course summary, which would have been helpful."
5,Early Ernest Tubb Box Set,"Here is yet another Bear Family records Ernest Tubb Boxset; this one covering his ""'50's"" career. These are not the earliest years, where Ernest's sound was nearly that of a soloist with an background band, but rather, these are the years of Ernest where the Troubadors really took off and became an entity of their own. There are 5 CDs here, all perfectly mixed and recorded with superb sound. There are many hard to find Tubb numbers included here; as well as the more famous ""There's a Little Bit of Everything in Texas"", ""Slippin' Around"", and ""Walkin the Floor"". This set also contains a few numbers where the Wilburn Brothers provide backup/accompanying vocals, as well as a tune or two where Doyle & Teddy Wilburn own the stage....a real treat. There is the usual Bear Family large booklet covering the career of ET during this timeframe and a detailed history of the discography. Plain and simple, you cannot be disappointed with this one. A+++++++"
2,Could have been better,I'm sorry but this set was a poor performance by one of the great country singers.It is a lifeless rehash of his career long after he had reached the peak and was on the way down. I expected a remastering of his older records when he was the best but received a major disapointment
1,Can I give it half-a-star?,"Mass produced in Canada for a low budget Co.,it contains many errors and repeats many mythsabout JFK that simply do not hold up to his-torical scrutiny. Yes, JFK was killed as a re-sult of a conspiracy, and yes there were manygroups involved (how come nobody wants to talkabout the Masons and Zionists connections tothe case?!). But that's where this tapes corr-ectness stops and the lies begin. Probably putout just to make a buck or as disinformation!"
4,Great but brutal,"The preview does not accurately depict the essence of this movie. It is a brutal, well done, realistic portrayal of an unusual war story. Definitely worth seeing, with an uplifting ending, but be prepared for gore and violence - particularly against women and girls."
4,different perspective,definitely a war film but with a different approach. you get to see what people are capable of when hard pressed. worth watching once and maybe even twice.
5,Outstanding WWII film about China,"This film was a chinese produced production. Christian Bale is outstanding as the fake minister dealing with a church holding a group of school girls and a group of ladies of the evening. They envolve from not working together on dealing with escaping the Japanese, to finally working together for the escape. Well acted, and a excellent production."
5,Pretty Good,"I was surprised with this movie. I honestly thought it was going to be another boring romance story, but it turned out to be a great show. I honestly cannot write a coherent review about the pros and cons of the movie, I can only give an opinion. So I'll just say its a decent flick!"
4,Flowers of War,Surprisingly I had never heard of this film up until I watched it on Amazon. At the beginning of the film I was immediately drawn into what it was about. I though the film was very well done and the acting was supurb. I rated this with four stars. If your looking for a good film with just enough action and realizism this it it.
2,Brutal war time,"The acting was good and it is a well made movie, but I really don't think all those brutal killing scenes were necessary to get the point across of how savage and inhumane the Japanese were in Asia, especially China. No wonder the Chinese still hold a grudge towards the Japanese and its goverment."
3,Not quite what I expected,"OK - would recommend it but not quite what I expected it to be. Good story line. I was looking for a more historical movie - this was good, had a nice story, but...."
4,Good movie,Good movie with a different look at the war from a Japanese and Chinese point view. If you are a fan of Bales you will like this movie.
1,Propaganda,This was severely disappointing. It was just more of the same old sickening anti-Japanese propaganda produced by China every year with a little bit of extra smut tossed in. This movie might as well not have had Christian Bale in it because it's not even in his league.
1,One star... at least for the first one half,"I can only honestly rate the first half of this movie, as that is as far as I could stand to watch it. I read the other reviews, and knew it was a risk, but the trailer looked interesting and the cast, etc. looked worthy. But, the bad reviews had it right. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,Ghastly film,"Hard to watch this simplistic barf.Money and time were spent on it, but I fast-forwarded before long, just to get through the embarrassing parts which run from start to finish.I won't waste money or time on it. Redboxed.Ghastly !Instead watch or maybe purchase: City of Life and Death by Lu Chuan"
1,subtitles-was not aware of this- Did not watch. Disappointed,DId not expect subtitles. waste of money as I did not see any mention of subtitles so did not watch
5,Really poignant,Its been a long while since I watched a movie that moved me this much. Its based on real event and well acted. Really touched by it.
5,great movie with great visuals,This movie had a great story and great visual effects. It's 3 hours long but wonderful! I would definitely recommend this for people that enjoy dramas. The language is mostly English but there are parts that have subtitles.
2,Not very good.,"This movie didn't come across as believable. Although the production was good, it had stock characters instead of realistic portrayals of people."
4,Bale does a good job,"Interesting plot and well acted by Bale and the Chinese girls and boys. Sort of like ""The Left Hand of God"" with Humphery Bogart but more interesting and more twisted. Very enjoyable."
4,Good Story,Good wartime story based loosely on actual events. Well done. Writing and cinematography were also well done. I would recommend it.
4,The flowers Of War,I like these kind of flicks. Some what based on a true story. Worth a look see and very interesting way of looking at that part of the war.
5,Zhang Yimou always tells a good story,I am a huge fan of Zhang YiMou ever since I watched Ju Dou in college but even more I love Raise the Red Lantern. This movie has the same beauty and brutality that Zhang Yimou is so good at capturing. Definitely a movie worth watching.
3,"Weird, but gets your attention",Very interesting and a lot different than movies I'm used to....worth the watch though! You really get to enjoy the characters as it goes on.
4,"Real, graphical and bloody, but good.","We like the movie since it was very real, but it was very graphic and not a fun movie. It did tell a wonderful story of courage and love."
4,Great Performances,Great performances in this movie. Hard to believe the pain these people went through and the honor and sacrifice they gave.
4,a little bit shorter than oversea version.,I bought this movie at BestBuy which run time is 142 minutes. Can anyone tell me whom own a copy from amazon correctly 146 minutes? I watched this movie online before it come out on blu-ray disc and seem to me on blu-ray disc lost 4 minutes of battle scene between Chinese and Japanese in the beginning of movie. Thanks.
4,Flowers of War,"Very emotional movie with great acting. What happens is one of the prices of war, but so inhumane. Scenery very realistic and Christian Bale does a good job. I would recommend."
2,disappointing and disturbing!,Very disturbing with obvious China bias. It seems this was made to sell well to the China market. Also the sexual assault scenes are very graphic and disturbing and seem to be that way for the sole purpose of painting the Japanese in a certain light. Too much political agenda going on to make a good story.
1,Did Pearl Buck get credit for this film?,"Yes, I saw the film. Then, I recently read ""Dragon Seed, China at War"" written by Pearl Buck about 1942. In one chapter, Buck describes Chinese girls - students and prostitutes - hiding in a missionary controlled school. When Japanese soldiers demand girls, the prostitutes offer themselves to save the young student girls. Same theme as the film."
2,Be warned,"Please be warned this movie is very graphic,several rape scenes of very young girls, I felt so upset by it I had to leave the room.It is too sad to watch ever again especially because I know things like this actually happened.This will be stuck in my mind a very long time."
2,A Dark Gruesome Film,"The storyline of this film is very interesting and at times inspirational. However, the violence and the graphic display of it is so over the top, it overpowers the redeeming parts of the film. Don't waste your money on it. There's much better films to watch than this one."
1,flowers,"Thought is was long and drawn out, mostly computerized scenes and explosions. Was a poor attempt to copy the theme in "" Broken Trail"". Was an attempt as well to show "" a low life can redeem himself"", by some heroic act, but he lived, didn't sacrifice himself. Tried to show there is some good in japanese prostitutes. Don't waste your money renting or buying."
2,so-so,"Disappointing film from very good Chinese action director. Story is odd mixture of implausible actions and motivations, sentimentality, and moments of strong violence."
2,I worked hard to focus and not fall asleep,"I was not impressed with this one. I can not write too much about the flick, because I turned it off early."
5,No Problem,"Haven't had a chance to actually use this battery yet, but charged it and tested it, and it seems fine so far. Shipping took less time than was expected."
4,Cheer for Gimme an F,"I use to watch this movie so many times when I was a kid...I loved this movie because it was not only a cheezy 80's movie but it was also a funny movie,but I do like the fact that the underdogs get there act together at the end..(if you know what I mean)Thanks"
4,Fingering weight yarn dreams but.....there be steeks!,"I am very fond of this book. There is a sophistication of color in the designs that I find appealing. I prefer fingering weight yarn and if you do as well, you'll love the designs in this book. I'm not a fan of zippers in sweaters but the patterns which include zippers could easily be turned into a v-neck, etc.I was surprised at how many of the patterns used steeks. Steeks require you to cut your knitting in a variety of ways (for sleeves, cardigan fronts, necklines). All of these can be reconfigured if you dislike steeks. Be aware of the need to noodle with the patterns if you choose not to steek.The sleeveless giraffe pullover is to die for!"
1,Disappointed,"I was hoping for more true tribal/regional patterns but this book is more about the author's interpretation of what ""seems"" african-like.The patterns are all shapeless and look more like standard fair-isle/intarsia patterns to be found elsewhere.Do not buy if you are looking for true African-inspired patterns."
4,Very nice designs,"I'd been looking at this book in the local yarn store for a bit. I really liked the designs. I started one of the sweaters and realized it's a little over my present skill set, so I abandoned the project. However, I'm still glad I own the book -- gives me a reason to improve my knitting! There are some very intricate designs. Overall, I think the book is well written, good photography. Some of the charts could be a little better presented. They're in color, and for me, a little harder to read. I copied the one I was using into black and white, and it was easier to follow."
5,Supreme Court Steps In,"Kelo, et al v New Haven, Conn. will be heard by the Supreme Court this session. New Haven is attempting to condemn a series of properties and LEASE the land to a developer for 99 years at a $1 a year. That is a unique twist. The city will own the land but the developer gets to build and sell the houses and commercial buildings. What makes this even more incredible is that the new owners of the the homes, never own the land. So 20 or 30 years from now the city can take their houses and build something else the ""City"" deems better use of the land.A Must Read!!!"
4,Zanzibar is the greatest story,"The story ""Zanzibar"" is unforgettable. Once you've heard it you will always remember that ""Zanzibar is very far."" I play it for my Fifth Graders as they get ready for a story-telling unit. They listen raptly, laugh, and sing along. I only wish the other stories were as great, but it's work getting this for just ""Zanzibar."""
5,Wonderful children's storytelling and music,"I was substitute teaching as an elementary school music teacher, so I decided to play ""Zanzibar"" for the kids. They loved it and I unintentionally unleashed Zanzibar-mania upon their unsuspecting teachers and parents. But no one was too mad at me, and in fact, they liked the good messages that the story has. Plus, it gave the teachers an opportunity to teach about geography by showing them Zanzibar on a map."
2,Sample is inadequate.,The free sample is inadequate. It is an excerpt from the foreword and is not enough to form an opinion about buying the book.
2,A Small Book With Smaller Ideas,"I admire Dr. Schaeffer and much of his other work, but this 64-page essay never hits its stride and is, at its best, repetitious. Dr. Shaeffer's thesis is that art, whether that which we think of as traditionally ""Christian"" or ""secular"" is okay with God as long as it meets certain conditions which the author finds by plucking a few verses from descriptions of the Temple, from the Psalms and from the Song of Songs.Far better in writing about this subject (if indeed it needs justification) is Madeline L'Engle in her beautiful ""Walking on Water"". This one, I'm afraid, left me cold."
3,"Tundra strut bushings and rods,","I have an 05 tundra and both sides of the strut assembly snapped. I priced the new ones at the dealer $98 for each bolt that holds the rubber shims! It was almost $300 for parts. This strut was for an 04, it was smaller in thickness and I can see why Toyota tried to beef them up but they are a replaceable item. The 04 assembly bolts work but they are wimpy, better than nothing so if you want a quick, inexpensive fix, these 04 strut kits will do the trick."
2,IT IS NOT EQUAL TO ORIGINAL PART,"I PURCHASED THIS PART BECAUSE I TRUST IN AMAZON BUT THE REALITY IS THE PART IS DIFFERENT THAN ORIGINAL ONE; RUBBER COMPONENTS ARE MINOR DIMENSIONS THAN ORIGINAL PART, LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO ACROSS STABILIZER BAR HOLES (IF YOU HAVE SEEN AN STABILIZER BAR YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN) NOW, EVERYTIME I DRIVE OVER A RAMP OR ANY HOLE ON THE ROAD, I HEAR THAT SOUND LIKE AN OLD DOOR. I PURCHASED THIS ITEM TO IMPROVE MY CAR RIDING BUT THE RESULT IS A MESS. I CLEANED AND LUBRICATED MY CAR CHASSIS BUT SOUND CONTINUES."
1,at least the talk show is free....,"i listen to art whenever i have drive all night looong and he does keep me from falling asleep at the wheel. this book:however,will send any insomniac into ""dreamland""! art is convinced that we are in an era known as the ""quickening""? which means that environmental or ""earth changes"" are about to cause ""something"" to happen. if you lis- ten to art's radio show you won't gain any real insight by buying this book. get his autobiography instead...since truth is strangerthan fiction!"
1,AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COST <G>!,"I really wanted to love this book. As a long time X File fan, I was thrilled to hear Art one morning on the way to work. After listening to the spooky late night host several times, I couldn't wait to get his book...Then I read it. A series of unlinked random thoughts which apparently have no connection, except to occasionally contradict each other, changed this cult hero into a babbling fool. THis is quite unfortunate."
1,"WE NEED A ""NO-STAR"" DESIGNATION","The reviewer who called this book ""simplistic, moronic trash"" was being much too kind."
1,The only thing we have to fear is irrational fear itself.,"I wanted to give The Quickening a zero star rating, but was forced to choose betwenn one and five stars, so I chose one. The Art Bell show should be taken as mere entertainment. Of course, Bell's show fails to entertain several people.I am a physics major and I like reading nonfiction (biographies, technical manuals, titles such as Operation Desert Storm: From Khoramshaar to Kuwait, etc.). Instead of spending hard-earned money for The Quickening, take a look at Carl Sagan's A Candle In The Dark. Unfortunately, Dr. Sagan died in 1997. He showwed his prescience when he wrote as the millennium approaches, fear and psuedoscience will proliferate and more and more doomsday cults will shock the nation with ever more horrifying acts."
4,"This is a great book,if you keep up on the news this will..","This is a great book,if you keep up on the news this will really open yer eyes."
4,Art Bell Tells It Like It Is!,"The Quickening, deals with global and domestic issues, socially, ecomically and politically with an enjoyable prose that leaves the reader with a better understanding of the hype perpetrated on an unsuspecting society. The research material is impressive. Bell's wit in dealing with troubling issues is refreshing, yet thought provoking; a well-indexed, fine read."
4,"Points for content, none for style","Although this book contains some interesting insights (some of which I didn't agree with) the style of the prose was lacking.Bell seems to achieve readability only in the ""fictional future"" paragraphs that introduce each chapter.While I applaud this book, and agree with most of it, I think Mr. Bell should try his hand at future-based fiction. The result would likely be better, and more readable."
1,The Art of Dreck,"Another paranoic diatribe by outer limits radio host Art Bell. ""The Quickening,"" while entertaining, is sheer nonsense. If it was packaged as fiction, it would have been easier to read. But alas it's all dreck with no scientific basis whatsoever. But there's a big audience for this kind of pseudo-scientific mysticism cum paranoia. Fortunately, I only read a review copy of the book and didn't buy it! Buyer beware."
2,"The Quickening is a disappointment, shallow and sophomoric.","The central idea is excellent and ""on target"" but the execution is shallow an sophomoric -- designed to make a ""quick buck"" in my view. I thought Art Bell had higher standards than this"
1,Art Bell Fails,"Sorry, but this book is poorly constructed and written. As a teacher, I would have to give it a failing grade, and a ""see me after class"" note as well."
1,Poorly researched & illogical,"Art Bell's book reaches for greatness, but fails miserably and completely. This book covers many topics, but not one of them appears to have been given the research it deserves. Or WE deserve! His conslusions are often off-base, and sometimes just plain dumb."
3,I think this book targets the paranoid and fearful.,"This book is intended for those who have decided to distance themeselves from society as a whole. It is obviously written to control those that are hooked on the end times and in so doing Art can hold them captive in his ""world""."
1,"Aimed at the tabloid reading, Ricki Lake-watching audience","It seems to me Mr. Bell is looking to cash in on the ignorant segment of middle America that spends their time reading the National Enquirer and watching Jerry Springer, feeding off mass paranoia. He offers an interesting concept, yet his accumulation of present day happenings is nothing more than an opinionated view of the state of our world seemingly preached to an elementary audience (those who don't know what a Richter scale or tornado are can get definitions in this book).If you've graduated from the ninth grade, don't read this book."
3,Will the future really be this bleak?,"Although this was a very informative book, I think that most people would prefer to shut their eyes to what's around them. It seems that we have enough of our own problems without worrying about fresh water supply, killer viruses, 3rd. world countries, environmental hazards, etc. The writing is quite matter-of-fact, and sometimes dry. However, his discussion on over-population really is the reason for many problems. I live in Chicago, and our utility company can't seem to keep up with the demands for electricity. It's an old system, needing repairs, but falling behind in the constant demand for more service. I think over-population, especially by those who are not fit to be parents, who can least afford to have them, or are far too young will be the root cause of The Quickening."
2,Great if you need some deep belly laughs,"Art is a master at entertaining (especially if one listens to his radio show for the sheer looniness of his guests), but a yawner when it comes to providing insightful analysis of the future. As this book aims to do the latter, all but the most ardent Bell fans will find this book to be a rambling collection of dubious observations strung together to create a gloom and doom vision of the future.This book reflects the paranoia that pervades Art's radio show. That paranoia provides the only redeeming quality of the book: kookiness. If you are in need of some deep belly laughs, then by all means--buy the book. It's the equivalent of sitting down with ol' Art himself, sharing a bottle of Wild Turkey until both of you are drunk, and then talking about aliens."
4,Thought provoking!,"Overall I enjoyed 'The Quickening'. As a sane, open-minded adult and an avid listener, I am able to make a clear judgement onto what is blatently ridiculous and what deserves to be looked at further and discussed. Art Bell is a very talented talk radio host and a highly intellectual human being. The book touches on aspects of twenty-first and near twenty-second century society that are merely crumbling before our very eyes. Any human being in touch with reality can not argue the fact that today's world is in utter chaos and is not headed into a positive direction. We as inhabitants of this very planet are direcly responsible for it's downfall and hopefully it's return to peace. 'The Quickening' should be read by every open-minded adult who is in touch with their own reality."
2,The New York Times Bestseller???????????,The only reason why I bought this book is because I picked it up at a barn sale for 50 cents. I picked up on a few things in this book but for the most part it was lame.
1,Outdated,I skimmed through the book but I couldn't bring myself to reading it. Most of the information is speculation and outdated. Art really should update this book.
1,CAUTION!,"Please! Do not confuse this ""end times"" work with the wonderful work by Stuart Wilde of the same name."
1,Art Bell fans will be disappointed,"This book proves that Art Bell's talent is as an interviewer, not as an author or authority in anything. There's nothing in this book that you wouldn't find by reading the newspaper for a week!"
3,"He tells it like he sees it, but overlooks the answers","This book is written like a newspaper and reads like one. Quite frankly, I appreciate his efforts at dumbing it down to a level anyone could enjoy. I didn't buy this book to read scientific research or statistics. I bought this book for Art Bell's unique outlook on life and that which is going on all around us. It's a light read that just begins to make you think about what's wrong with our society. The solutions to the problems of the world, as Art Bell sees them, are left up to the reader. Thank you for that, Art. I believe one problem with America today is that nobody searches for the answers to lifes mysteries. We expect everything and try our hardest to use as little of our precious junk food energy reserves to get it. Thanks again, Art, for a very interesting book. Keep up the good work!"
1,"""The Quickening"" should be titled ""The Sickening""","This book desreves zero stars, but we gave it one star because there is no lower rating. Our metaphysical reading group at Pages for All Ages Bookstore in Champaign, IL, concluded this book a complete waste of paper and ink. Art Bell has a fun radio program, but his editors have created an awful book. This is a book of NO answers. Does Art Bell have an opinion on anything? We couldn't find one. But the book does manage to reflect some paranoid, superstitious position of the most murky kind.The greatest disappointment of this book was the tone of it, as if impending danger lurks around every corner and we as a species are doomed. If the man had offered one answer it might have been different, but the whole book was a collasal bummer, even for our acutely optimistic reading group. Book readers everywhere, avoid this piece of tripe at all costs!"
3,Feed your paranoia!,"Well, as an avid Art Bell listener I have to say that I have really enjoyed the entertaining aspects of his radio talk show. This book, ""The Quickening"" is a synopsis of his many years of exposure to the paranoid negativity out there. As a fellow paranoid space junkie, I must say that this book satisfies the need inside of me to be entertained by thoughts of impending doom and end of the world scenarios. Although, the information contained within may be factual, and the observations of a Quickening to be accurate, it is still just a book full of entertaining scenarios to quench the mental thirst of those of us bored with terrestrial life! Come on board...if you dare!"
2,A disappointing book.,"From my exposure to Art Bell's radio show, I expected more than he provides in this book. Bell has a surprisingly conservative perspective, berating everything from environmentalists to the New Age Movement, and he does so on the basis of distortions and generalizations. He dwells on the negative aspects in ""today's trends"" but offers no solutions. Thus his concluding remarks are lame: ""Right now, the world is only getting progressively more chaotic and dangerous. At the very least, let us all hope and try to change what we can. We are at a crossroads in human history, and it is clear that unless we take some drastic measures to improve our plight, the road less traveled will not necessarily be the brightest one. Just wanting to believe that everything is 'not really that bad' is not the solution. What we do in the Quickening of today will determine tomorrow's world."""
1,Only for those wilfully ignorant of modern science.,"Culled from the parade of loonies that is the Art Bell Radio Show, this book will interest only the truly credulous, True Believers who have no interest in the truly wonderful in the real world. Indistinguishable from the scores of fortunetellers who claim the World is going into an irrecoverable flat spin, Art Bell and his claims of pseudoscience in The Quickening can be disposed of by reference to any high school textbook or any of the popular science books for the interested layman.Save yourself the money and wait until The Quickening appears in the dollar bin. Better yet, just listen to the radio show."
4,great read for the layman,nice read for the layman and general public- could have been a bit more detailed though. An important and very relevant subject as humanity enters the 21st century
1,sillyness,After reading this babble I needed a capuccino to get my head back in order. Can I give this book a zero star review?
5,Art Bell is the authority on the subject.,"Art Bell, of Late Night Talk Show fame, has hit it right on the button. Anyone who listens to the news will see that many of the things Art discusses in his book are coming true."
1,"I'm glad this was a gift, and I didn't have to buy it!!!!","I felt like I was reading page after page of USA Today stories' opening paragraphs. I could write a book like this, merely capturing all of the popular stories in the news today and putting them all together. He quickly presents all that is happening in the world as if he were the first to recognize the problems, then just as quickly moves on to the next topic. I have to agree with some of the previous reviews I've read -- it would have helped if Mr. Bell would have provided some sources to back up some of his opinions. I don't discount the premise of the book, things are changing very fast these days. There's nothing in this book that is ""insightful,"" or ""makes you think!""-- if you stay up-to-date with today's news, you've essentially read this book."
2,"You are truly a radio pioneer, but this book falls way short","As an avid listener of Art Bell Coast to Coast during its always interesting run prior to Art's departure from the airwaves, I picked up The Quickening hoping for an exciting read. What I received, unfortunately, was not what I was expecting to find. Loose and vague predictions dot the pages of this book, some of which include the future condition of our society, and the future of world warfare. In whichever way you look at this book, the ideas presented can be interesting to ponder. Although The Quickening is a definite good read for someone who throughly enjoys this kind of soothsaying, it is quite a leap for someone who enjoys a down-to-earth read. Welcome back Art on February 5, 2001!"
5,Outstanding,"If you would only go at it with an open mind, you too would find that what he says is merely open-minded and not preaching. Outstanding perspective"
5,Beautiful journey into the mysteries of love.,"All the poetry and quotes within show a love of language, or one might say, a love affair of words... and a depth of feeling. Excellent emotions and not too mushy... The art may be a little risque but it really does do the poetry more than justice..."
2,has some bugs,"I bought this watch at target because it looked great. I have had it for a couple of months and normally wear it outside in short sleeves so it gets plenty of sun. However, it randomly resets itself to 1-1-2000 12 midnight about every 2 weeks! I find it very annoying to have to reset the watch so frequently. It also goes into power save mode at random times and displays an incorrect time (power save mode freezes the clock hands and shuts off the digital display when it thinks you won't be using the watch). I think this is all probably a defect in the solar technology and not just a defect in my watch. I wouldn't recommend this watch"
2,A Captivating Read With an Unsatisfying Ending,"Yes, I am familiar with the whole Laura Palmer story, but even so, I was not that impressed. I will admit that it grabbed me, and I ended up finishing the entire book in a few hours. The BOB dialogue bugged me, and I thought it was sort of cheesy. It made the whole idea of it being a ""real"" diary sort of unrealistic. I can, however, appreciate the way the story was about how drug/sex addiction and child abuse are interwined. So, for that I give it TWO stars, instead of one. (Oh, and by the way, to the person who mentioned the book ""Go Ask Alice"" --- it was a fake diary.)"
3,"Good Read, yes. TV Show supplement, no.","I bought this book with the intention of having it as a supplement to the TV show ""Twin Peaks"", which I also bought on DVD. However, the events which are written in the book really have nothing to do with anything that is portrayed in the TV show. There are a few tidbits in the book that correspond with the facts presented in the show, but other than that, its mainly a tool for more character development that the show wasn't able to offer. As a book to read by itself, it reads like a diary, so you can't really critique the writing style or plot of the book at all. Most of the book features characters from the TV show. There really isn't that much merit to it. I would recommend reading this book before watching the series from beginning to end as it does present some foreshadowing of things to come."
3,"Interesting, but not the real thing.","I bought this as a gift for my husband. He enjoyed it, mostly the novelty of actually owning THE Laura Palmer diary, but it is clearly evident that it is not (and does not even try that hard) to be THE diary from the series/movie."
2,Interesting but could have been a lot better,"I found this book too full of holes. As a hard-core Twin Peaks fan, there were too many indescrepancies between this book and the movies / series. I can see how people would love this book as it does have it's merits eg. sexy, entrancing, easy to read but I think a bit more insight, thought and research should have been put into it. Otherwise, it's a good filler for the collection."
2,Not worth the time,"I'm a big Twin Peaks fan but this was a bit of a stretch for even me. It gave a couple of insites, but really. Why didn't they do a book on the history of Bob or any other topic that was touched upon in the show but not fully explored? It's just not worth the time."
1,Are you kidding?,"Are all the reviews written on Amazon personally penned by Jennifer Lynch? This is a terrible book! Of course, Twin Peaks fans had to read it, but as a literary effort, this scores well below ""Couplehood."" The language is understandably amateurish, but after a certain number of pages, the gossip column-like writing becomes tiresome and banal. <em> How many italicized setences can we take? </em>On the other hand, I did enjoy the insights into Laura's character and the deepening of her relationship with Bobby. All that was good until Jennifer Lynch wacks us over the head with her subtle insights and awkward device that uses the prescence of BOB as the secondary voice which communicates with Laura through her diary. It is, without the shadow of a doubt, dumb."
5,Violet 19,Love Cecilia and this was no different. Received cd quickly and in great shape. Thanks for the great service
1,Christmas Carol redux,"I have seen about four different tellings of the tale ""Christmas Carol"". I'm not that fond of it to begin with. When I found that this book is just a rip off of that tale, albeit Valentine's Day instead of Christmas, I was not a happy camper. In fact, I'm not sure I'm even gonna bother reading the rest of it. After all, I'm pretty sure I can guess how it ends."
3,Cute idea that doesn't quite pan out,"Liv is a wedding photographer who has not had the best of luck with men. Valentine's Day, in particular, carries lots of really bad relationship memories for her. Still, family and friends always try to set her up with a date on Valentine's Day because they don't want to see her alone on that special couples' day. This year she is determined to be alone on Valentine's Day and is pleasantly surprised, although a bit puzzled, that people aren't pushing her into attending a party or go on a date. Then she suddenly starts having Dicken's ""Christmas Carol"" style visits from the ghosts of Valentine's Day past, present, and future, which of course, will change her life. Cute idea, but Liv is a whiny person and the character development and writing is just not good enough to pull it off well. I was surprised, because ""The Dairy Queen"" was released about the same time as this novel and is much better."
4,An okay Valentine's Day story,"This book is more like a modern day A Chrirstmas Carol, only with Valentine's Day as the main theme. Liv Hetherington, a wedding photographer, is a humbug about Valentine's Day. Mostly because of the break up she went through two years ago ON Valentine's Day, that she never got over. Between her dead co worker and three spirits visiting her and a new man named Drew trying to enter the picture, Valentine's Day just might turn around for Liv this year."
3,Hating Valentine's Day,"You don't hear of Valetinine Scrooges, but they do exist; case in point, Liv Hetherington, a wedding photographer who has had it with V-day rituals and dating diseasters. Yet, when everyone who has been urging her into these romantic nightmares gives up on her, there is a strange let down until she discovers that Fate is willing to give her one last chance. Her ""Marley"" is the ghost of an old woman with the unlikely name of Mrs. Batty Smith, who informs her that three spirits will visit her to encourage her to change her ways. Cupid, aka, Valentines' Past, is sort of cute, albeit irksome. Valentines' Present is the ideal man, one that readers who like to play the book as a movie in their head will want to hit pause on when he comes around. The spirit of the Future- we won't go there. Suffice it to say, she outdoes Christmas Future on the scary level. With more humor than Dickens, readers are given an equally meaningful message that applies to any day, not just Valentine's Day."
1,These do not fit,"I have the dome into which these are supposed to fit but they are WAY TOO SMALL, especially once your cat goes and they start shifting around. What a bad product."
2,ok,"Got these for my booda dome for my cat. they come square shaped and they do fit the dome but it doesn't line the litter box well because of movement. My cat likes to bury around in his litter box sometimes and the edges end up caving in so you're stuck with litter getting underneath it. I usually end up taping the liner to the box to prevent it from moving around so much, but my cat does end up putting holes in them. It works in that it does keep most of the litter in the liner and makes it easier to clean up the litter box without worrying about scrubbing. I tried using trashbags before, but the one's I have aren't big enough so if you decide to go that route, make sure you get the bigger ones. I think I had the regular kitchen tall trash bags which didn't fit."
1,Do not fit the Booda Dome,The liners do not fit and made for a horrible mess. This product was a horrible waste of money and time! I do not recommend it for anyone!
3,Could be better,This liner can be a pain to keep on the box. My cat always get it to fall in. It would be better if there was a elastic on the edges so it will not come off so easy. I always have to scrape the poop off the bottom of the box because this liner falls in.
1,Doesn't fit well,"One liner came with the Booda Dome and it was great. I tried these replacements and they aren't as big. They don't fit well and after a few days, the bottom has small tears in it from scooping. They aren't at all like the sample that came with the dome. They need to be a bit bigger and a bit thicker."
5,Perfect fit,"These liners fit my kitty's Booda Dome perfectly, with about a half-inch visible @ the lip when the lid is placed on. When ordering, keep in mind that these are specifically for the regular Booda Dome, not the one with the steps."
2,Not as advertised.,"Even though made for Boda Dome they do not fit. Bags are rectangular not round, just reach the edges of liter box.Once you actually put liter in,bags pull away from the sides and cats bury pieces under liter. Bags are also very thin, only last a day or two before being useless. Better to buy any brand extra large, heavy duty bags or go without bags at all."
1,Dont buy waste of money.,Horrible waste of money. DO NOT BUY! They are not a good fit. Litter everywhere! Very messy as soon as my cat stepped in the dome the bag came of the sides and litter went all under the bag.
1,Don't fit,I have no idea why they say these fit the Boda dome. The dome is round but these liners are rectangular and not large enough. After a day or so of use they fall into the box and the litter spills out of it. Useless.
2,Wrong Table of Contents,"I was lucky. I checked this book out of the library.Although the information in the book is interesting and was, in fact, almost exactly what I was looking for, I too was disappointed that items in the table of contents did not appear in the actual chapters of the book!I checked here at Amazon and was glad to read a review that confirmed my findings--that the table of contents was misleading. This could be a very big problem for an online buyer.My advice: Check it out of the library and if you like it, then buy it online!"
2,"Again and Again rechargeable ""D"" batteries","These rechargeable ""D"" batteries were purchased May 29, 2008 for use in a weather radio. Three times the batteries lasted 2-3 days before recharging.Going back to the ""Product Description"" I noted the capacity was 3000 mAh which is about the capacity of ""AA"" alkaline batteries.Went back to Amazon to search for other rechargeable ""D"" batteries. Found AccuEvolution batteries which were 10,000 mAh. Purchased these batteries on JUNE 18TH and installed in my weather radio. These are still on the first charge after 8 days.I returned the ""Again and Again"" batteries to Amazon for refund. As I had to open the package to try the batteries, hope Amazon will refund the $30.86 cost."
3,A sheep in Wolf's clothing,"While the game is gorgeous in all aspects while on, some areas are left with a bad after taste. I kept finding myself questioning why I kept getting shot while holding a hostage and facing toward the police, and often they would shoot to hostage killing her, which leeds me to wonder the whole point, Or the near impossibility of dogging fire.I remember laughing when an opponent lives through a few point blank shotgun shots, but hey, who cares right? The game was fun but it kept turning me off, I can't explain it, but it even seemed pointless at times. I would only give it 3 out of five stars."
3,Decent But Could Be Better!,"This game has style, great cell graphics and an intriguing storyline. But the gameplay leaves a little to be desired. The multiplayer mode needs to be more refined ala Red Faction2 options. There's some of it in this game but not much. Also the enemy AI are all expert marksmen. They score shots even when they are at an angle that it would be impossible to make that shot. You walking, running target at all times. The whole concept of stealth is an oxymoron in this game! Consider renting first!"
1,*cough* Bourne Identity,"I haven't played this yet and so I can't comment on it's gameplay or graphics, but after reading the description of this game a few times already, may I ask what (if anything) about this story is original? It seems to copy the plot of the ""Bourne Identity"" movie with Matthew Damon exactly. That's not a bad thing, I suppose, since Borne Identity didn't get a game conversion of it's own, but I would prefer that they simply bought the rights and made a Bourne' game outright, rather than creating what is likely to appear as a rip-off of the film."
4,Good but could be better,"I bought this game because the creators, Ubisoft, also made Rainbox Six 3 which is an awesome game.I just finished this game so I thought I would give a review and hopefully give others an idea of whether to buy this game.I liked this game cause it's different that the other games out there. The comic book feel of the game is definitely a change.The only thing i didn't like about this game was the number of stealth missions that you had to go through. Also, i wish you could go through the missions with another player. You do have the option of playing against one another of the different maps with the multiplayer option, but it's not the same as going through the missions. And you do have the option of playing this game online through Xbox Live.All in all, it's still a pretty good game and i would recommend it.PS: Beware of Mongoose!"
4,Gray day jazz,"Since it's not included, here's the CD's playlist. Hope you find it useful.PROGRAM'Round Midnight - Charles BrownSpring Can Really Hang You Up The Most - Houston Person & Ron CarterEverything Must Change - David ""Fathead"" Newman**A Tribute To A Rose - Jimmy PonderBlue In Green - Wallace RoneyTalk Of The Town - Houston PersonRuby My Dear - Hank JonesI Can't Get Started - Warren VacheMy Ideal - Sonny CrissSt. Louis Blues - Johnny LytleImagination - Woody ShawTOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 56:42.**'Fathead' Newman was sax soloist on the 1964 Ray Charles Live In Concert album (ABC/PARAMOUNT)."
4,Music for the moods,"If you're a jazz lover, you have probably heard some of the series of jazz music that sets a mood, i.e. ""Jazz at Night's End,"" Jazz at Love's End,"" etc. This is a charming series of which I have most of their offereings.The other ""reviewer"" just gives a list of the tunes, & says nothing of the music itself. People like Ron Carter, Warren Vache, Hank Jones, etc. are represented on this album,& it does exactly what it's supposed to do. It sets a mood. I love this series, & I recommend it highly."
2,Formulaic at best,"While every track is competently performed and recorded, the whole band seems to have phoned this in from somewhere in the late 1980s. The bass lines are utterly repetitious. There are literally thousands of CDs you could listen to with more going for them."
5,This is the book that started it all for me,"Hart of thunder was the very first book of Johanna's that I read and in fact whenever I need a good book to get away from it all, I pick it back up and read it all over again. I think this is one of the best books she has every read, and I read all that come out, I believe that the stubbornness that they have make it all that more interesting to read. She is an excellent writer and even when I don't agree with some of the way the storylines are going, I still never stop till I reach the very last page, and I always have something positive that came out of the experience. Hank and Samantha have it all, sex, love and passion.... Forever!"
3,OHHHH,i liked this book coz it started off really well but i thought that samantha and hank had a little too much pride to be an ordinary person and so made the book drag on far too long this is what made me not give the book a good rating.
2,Heart of Thunder,"It had been so long since I had read this book, I confused it with another. I am pleased with the speed and quality f this item."
2,Just so-so.,"There was nothing memorable about this book. Hank was OK, Samantha was Ok, the plot was OK, but it was not a true JL romance."
1,Not Lindsey at Her Best,"This book and Lindsey's ""Captive Bride"" are so similar in plot and characters that I felt I was reading the same book twice."
2,Heart of Thunder (Mass Market Paperback),"I've read quite a few Johanna Lindsey books and liked them. But I have to say that this was the worst book I read in a long time. I liked Hank and thought he was way too nice to Samantha and deserved better. That is the only reason I'm giving this book 2 stars. If you like spoiled, rich girls that are complete shrews, this is the book for you. She was a snarky viper throughout the whole book and easily distorted fact from fiction to justify her nastiness. I'll read more Johanna Lindsey books, but I'm truly hoping that they aren't as bad as this one."
2,Not what I expected at all. A 12 year old reader from Ca.,"This book was fairly informative but it wasn't meant for the teenage eye. It is for mother's that are to embarassed to talk to their children about these things or are not prepared to talk about it, so they buy there kids books and have then read them instead of having a talk with them personally. It's not a substitute. I wish my mom would talk with me about this stuff. I'm not ready at all and I haven't gotten my period but it could come at any time. I am interested in this stuff and I want someone besides my sister to talk about it with."
4,Must have for Mothers (and Fathers).,"I was very impressed. I am not ready to talk to my daughter about menstruation but her body is telling me it is time. This book is mostly written for a mother. It has stories from girls and their mothers on how they feel about the subject of menstruation. However there is also a chapter just for Fathers on how to deal with their menstruating daughters and stories about how they learned about menstruation and how to talk to their sons about it.I bought this book to give me an idea of where to begin the talks with my daughter, how to answer her questions, and the right language to use to make it easier for her to understand what is going to happen to her body. Reading this I feel more confident now that I can talk to her about all the changes of her body and that she will feel comfortable talking to me also."
1,Kindle quality very poor,"While the book was very good from a story perspective, there were so many spelling errors, incomplete sentences, and jumbled words (as far as I'm aware w1 is not a word) that the book was far less enjoyable than it could have been. By all means read a printed version as it may not suffer from these issues, but the kindle version is not particularly nice."
1,Where do I start?,"This is the second book that I have been unable to finish in my life. I slogged trhough ""Taliesan"" hoping that the series would get better. It got worse. The characters are pitifully shallow, though Lawhead seems to think he's giving them depth and motivation by inserting a few temper-tantrums and pseudo-profound musings. There's quite a bit of pointless wailing and foreshadowing which only serves to confuse the reader, but what I really couldn't stomach was the unbelievably andro- and Christian-centric tone of the books. The only woman with any spine at all is the villian of the piece. How shocking. And the self righteous piety of Merlin and his merry band can only be stomached for so long. I reccomend that any female with an ounce of self-respect read Marion Zimmer Bradley's ""The Mists of Avalon"" if you're looking for Arthurian lore."
4,Enchanting!!,"I enjoyed this book a bit more than Taliesin, which was the first of the Pendragon cycle. This book is told in the first person narrative, which makes it easier to follow. All aspects of Merlin's life are brought out in this wonderful book, his brief reign as warrior-king; the ""mad"" hermit in the forest; and finally in the role of mystic bard, which is the most familar. Lawhead writes in a very enjoyable style, and the book takes you along as the story progresses. While a different approach to the Arthurian legend, I would highly recommend this series!"
5,Myrddin Emrys is back,"Thank you very much Mr. Lawhead. Thank you for giving us a new Merlin: a man, a bard, a holy man. The tale of his life and doings, of his struggles and pains kept me tied to the book for many breathless beautiful hours. How I wish I could have met him and be at his service. He reminded me of another wonderful character: Master Elrond of Imladris, created by Prof. Tolkien. What do you think about this?"
4,GOOD FOR THE PRICE,NOT AS THICK AS I WOULD LIKE BUT FOR THE PRICE IT IS ALRIGHT AND THE SERVICE WAS GOOD
1,useless,Sold as an ergonomical seat. This is not true. It is very thin and does nothing for your back.
1,I did not like.,"This product is very simple, shortly after he broke one of the clips on the seat and it was hard to put on the seat."
5,Almost unknown but very good,"Almost You is a little-known but very funny film which has two classic sequences: a job interview, which anyone who's ever interviewed job prospects will relish, and a disaster of a dinner party. As another reviewer points out, this is more realistic than the average Woody Allen movie. Griffin Dunne's movie career fizzled, which is a shame, considering how skillful and charming his work is here. Brooke Adams made very few films, but most of them are good, and she had something to do with that. Give this film a try: it's much smarter and more honest than the average romantic comedy."
2,Basic,The video teaches with a very basic method of one person signing at least 5 signs for each letter of the alphabet. This video teaches the parents the signs and then its up to the parent to teach their toddler. This is not toddler friendly.
5,Uncommon Dissent,"I have been following the controversy between Darwinian Evolution and Intelligent Design for about ten years, and I have piled up a small collection of books on the subject. If you're interested in this topic, and if you're browsing ""Uncommon Dissent"" I assume you are, then I would say ""Darwin's Black Box"" is a basic for your library. This volume, ""Uncommon Dissent,"" is another must, in my opinion. It is a collection of essays by Intelligent Design people -- even if you're an Evolutionist, just for the sake of an open mind, you should glance through this -- and it is very readable and un-technical and entertaining, and is worth buying just for the sake of David Berlinski's article at the end. But there are lots of others that will hold your interest, even if they infuriate you! If you are a believer in Intelligent Design, you are in for a treat."
2,Disappointing,"Written from the perspective of a leader in the Intelligent Design Movement, by virtually ignoring the opinions of Young Earth Creationists (Henry and John Morris, Ken Ham, Gary Parker, etc.) this work loses a great deal of credibility. It is obvious that Intelligent Designers make a conscious effort not to associate themselves with YEC's on the basis that the latter are ""intellectually embarrassing."" A 6,000 year old earth? How absurd!The truth is that YEC's are the true leaders in the battle against the Great Lie - the Theory of Evolution - and they are the ones who will receive the lion's share of credit when this blasphemous theory lands on the ash heap of history, where it belongs - and where it is surely headed."
4,Why do Rationalist use irrational arguments??,"Wow....after reading the customer review's of this book and Jonathan Well's Icons of Evolution I see all the negative reviews state that there is a plethora of evidence on behalf ofevolution. Yet none seem to mention even just one fact but instead resort to name-calling and making personal attacks on the writers of these works or thier reputations..i.e. ""couldnt hack it at Baylor university""... how does the reviewer know this?? Yet those of us on the ID side of the debate are supposedly the irrational, emotional ones without any kind of rational arguments...HAHAHAHA"
1,Pointless,First question? Why do Samuel L. Jackson die in all his movies? Is he obess with death. This movie made no sense. He playing a teacher who is trying change thinking of his students. He failed. They play a game by putting a gun to their heads and one of them died. A guess he was the ring leader. anyway- one of them say as this is happening; You the Man. Stupid. More like you the fool. All the time while Samuel L.Jackson charcter looked on helpless. And than a few moments later he died. This movie is Whack. 'nough said.
1,R U DUN,Glis was very frapper. She had denarpen Farfie's mardsen. She couldn't galp a giberter for Farfie. Instead she wharked to plimp a mardsen binky for him.
3,great movie,Samual L. Jackson was excellent in this movie. His portrial of a teacher gone over board was breath taking. He showed clearly that the only way to destroy the crime is to become a crimanal yourself. Programs and community a awareness don't always work and thats when we need a little 187!
3,Samuel L. Jackson is outstanding...,"This film was written by a real life teacher and shows what rough schools can be like. Jackson (a brilliant actor anyway) delivers his performance as a teacher on the edge, superbly. The film was suspenseful and often gripping. It's scary to think that a school could resemble this."
5,"Great, suspenseful movie!",This movie was wonderful! I never wanted to get up while watching it. Samuel L. Jackson played a great role and did a outstanding job just like the other actors. This movie is a must see!
5,****A great movie with the great SAMUEL L. JACKSON ! ****,"The gangs are ! Anybody know that ! But when a true story recount as a professor who has only his job in his life to survive while he is embarked in a bad almost murder to himself, and when after that, he is bound to appropriate the bad instinct of the bads gangsters for make to them the same thing who has lived some years ago, he take his courage and go heretofore at the extremity of the human gender, with no limits ! This is a true MOVIE with a forceful man as SAMUEL L. JACKSON SPLENDID WHEN THE YOUNG MAN CHICANOS HAS HIS FINGER CUT !!!"
1,187,i writing to tell you i did nt get this movie 187 it should had been here by march 30th and it not here so where is my movie 187 i check my visa and i been charge for that and have not got it so pls email me at ace48420@yahoo.com thank you
4,"GRITTY, A MUST SEE FILM FROM BEGINING TO END !!!",The film is A hard hitting drama from the begining to end about the constant challenges techers face in are public schools with the lead character played by non other than Samuel Jackson leading An A list cast getting to the point the movie shows how one person can influence other people in there community to make A difference to inspire change that's what this movie is about enough said you'll just have to check it out for yourself to understand the full meaning
5,good movie,"DVD came in very good timely manner, box was a lil scratched, but movie played very good.. no problems"
4,A damn good movie,"I think the character that really brings this movie out is ""Cesar Sanchez"" played by Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez, he did an excellent job, he really shines through the movie. Man he is really going places."
3,Pure corn !,"I am old enough to remember this when it was released. Now, more than fifty years later, it just seems so corny, but I just had to have it for my collection."
3,A Movie Of Extremes,"Scenes in this movie were either very interesting and funny or they were very stupid and annoying.There was no middle ground.One of the interesting parts was seeing some of the early rock performers such as Gene Vincent and Bluecaps, Fats Domino, The Platters and several others. It also was nice to see Julie London in one number. The humor was mainly provided by Tom Ewell, who played a role similar to the one he played in the much-funnier ""Seven-Year Itch.""Annoying was Edmund O'Brien, who was parodying a loud-mouth gangster. Well, he was so loud and abrasive it became offensive after just a short time. Jayne Mansfield was okay. She was in the movie, obviously, for one thing: show off her mammoth chest. With the pointed bras of the day, it looked just plain weird.While it's somewhat boring for today's audience, for its time period - the mid '50s - I'm sure this movie must have freaked out a lot of people."
5,"A MUST SEE for ""real Rock n' Roll"" fans.","""The Girl Can't Help It"" is in the top three of best films featuring fifties rock artists. In addition to rare clips of some of the era's best rock artists, the film features Jayne Mansfield at the time in her life when she was at the peak of her beauty and charisma, in this writer's opinion."
1,One Star For The Price,"If you want an excellent anamorphic CinemaScope transfer of this comedy, why pay the $42 most sellers are asking for this one DVD, when you can buy the same flik with 2 other Mansfield opuses (""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter"" & ""Sheriff From Fractured Jaw"", both also crisp anamorphic transfers) for about $25 in the triple set ""The Jayne Mansfield Collection"" put out by 20th Century a few years ago? It's still available right here on this site. Just use the Amazon search engine. After all, it isn't like this ""Classic Collection"" release is on a blu-ray transfer. Why the exorbitant price?"
4,Daydreamer and cherish,"It's an excellent compilation!! but it could be superb if it would include some songs from: ""Dreams are nuthin' more than wishes"" album, wich in my opinion it's Cassidy's best performance. By the way, does any body knows if this album exists in CD? I'll appreciate any information about it"
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in this recording. I was expecting ""The Best of"" the Partridge Family. Instead, only eight of the 20 songs are by the Partridge Family. Because this is listed with the Partridge Family recordings, I expected it to contain mostly Partridge Family recordings."
3,"Sure it's disposable - but so is ""N'Sync"" or Brittany -","Hey, everybody - like the caption said, yeah, it's disposable. But seriously, how can you have the temerity to say this stuff is ""bad"" when ""N'Stync"" or Brittany or ""Sysqo"" are considered ""cool"" right now? Be a little REAL, folks: at least THIS pre-fab outfit had living, breathing session musicians backing them. These...uh...""Y2K pop artists"" now have no more ""backing"" than some amphetiminized transgengered whatever wanking over a brace of synthesizers. Larry Knechtel may BE right, certainly, but at least he is a human. Let HIM make the call!"
2,Not definitive at ALL!,"This CD is far inferior to the previously released ""Greatest Hits"". The liner notes have eroors (and aren't very informative to the crazed fans), one song was butchered by poor, unnecessary editing and worst of all, their best tracks from ""Bulletin Board"" and ""Crossword Puzzle"" were left off! NO album can be definitive without at least one or two tracks from each of those albums....but then again, Arista has always been horrible with reissues. Look at what they did with the Monkees catalog on CD before Rhino got around to it....NO COMPARISON!Back to PF...the ""Greatest Hits"" CD has a better selection of songs (including the theme song and one song from ""Bulletin Board"") and better liner notes to match."
5,ANOTHER GREAT ENRTY IN ARISTA'S DEFINITIVE COLLECTION SERIES,"Arista's latest Definitive Collection for David Cassidy & the Partridge Family is a great set.With the exception of the fine album cut ""Point Me in the Direction of Albuquerque"", every song is a bonafide US and/or UK Billboard chart HIT.For example, the long lost ""Breaking up Is Hard to Do""(US-28/UK-3), ""Walking in the Rain""(UK-10), ""Daydreamer""(UK-1),""If I Didn't Care""(UK-9), ""Please,Please Me""(UK-16), and of course ""I Think I Love You""(US-1/UK-18). This set will give you a great survey of the HITS of David Cassidy & the Partridge Family and then lead you to the fantastic original albums currently on CD and finally join the legion of fans in asking Arista for the complete David Cassidy/Partridge Family catalog on CD. ALso checkout Arista's other fine Definitve Collections including Tony Orlando & Dawn, Melissa Manchester, and the 5th Dimension"
2,"Not Definitive, Nor Partridge Family","If you want a definitive Partridge Family CD, do not buy this one. You will not find many of your favorite songs and someone decided to threw in solo work from David Cassidy as filler. The CD is not bad, just badly titled. If you aren't mislead by the title, you might enjoy the music."
3,C'MON AND STOP BORING US,"I am a Partridge Family fan since their debut 31 years ago.On this cd David's music is here.Save it for his own.He's a great bluesy singer,but this shuld have been a Partridge Family cd with the series theme songs,""WHEN WE'RE SINGING"" and C'mon get HAPPY"".What is missing here are tracks from CROSSWORD PUZZLE which David Cassidy himself stopped BUDDAH from being released.PLus alot of tracks that are still unreleased to fans dismay from the tv show.C'MON MAKE US FANS HAPPY.wE put you on top,by buying the albums,records and other paraphenelia.Give us what we want."
5,THE PARTRIDGES STILL ENDURE,"I WAS LIKE A LITTLE KID AGAIN TO LEARN THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY WERE BEING RE-RELEASED AGAIN IN 2000 FOR A NEW GENERATION TO HEAR AND LIKE,I LOVE ALL THE OLD SONGS -WITH THESE NEW TRACKS I'VE NEVER HEARD BEFORE,AND YES, THEIR GREAT TOO. DAVID CASSIDY ALWAYS HAD AND STILL HAS A BRILLANT VOICE. IT'S A REAL TREASURE TO HAVE -THANKS DAVID AND ARISTA RECORDS FOR MAKING US PARTRIDGE FANS ''HAPPY''AS THE BUS DRIVES OFF INTO THE MULTICOLORED SUNSET."
3,Definitive?,"A nice selection of tunes, but even being a die hard fan,I am at a loss as to why the producers of this collection can't get true fans opinion on what is difinitive.Of course, I Think I love You MUST be included, but what about some of the better album cuts representing all the albums. Everyone knows the singles...I have my own idea of a definitive collection and it is not anything like this. The best cuts on this are Friend and a lover, Breaking up... and Rock Me Baby, (which sounded better than I remembered) since, so far this is the first they have been available on CD. When will the label wise up and release the three remaining albums-Notebook,Crossword Puzzle and Bulletin Board? This collection was really not much better than The Greatest Hits (Lunchbox)."
4,A Good Beginner's Guide/Refresher,"This book is exactly what the title promises it to be -- a ""Very Short Introduction"" to our species' family tree. It's not the best book there is on the basics of human evolution. (For that, I would recommend Carl Zimmer's ""Smithsonian Intimate Guide to Human Origins."") But for a very small, easy to read, inexpensive introduction to the subject of human origins, it's pretty good.This little book clearly and concisely covers such topics as: the basics of biological evolution, significant hominin fossil finds, and fossil dating methods. I'm studying physical anthropology, and I found it to be a great refresher. In fact, I even learned of a dating method that has yet mentioned in any of my classes so far -- ostrich egg shell dating. Reading ""Human Evolution: A Very Short Introduction"" won't turn you into today's Louis or Mary Leakey, but it will probably teach you a few things about where (and who) we came from, as well as how we know."
5,The single most compelling holocaust film ever made,"I first saw this film in a high school history class 20 years ago, before the subject was at all topical or widely-studied. ""Night and Fog"" I felt was the perfect title - ""Night"" because it was the darkest period in human history, and ""Fog"" because it showed us how the rest of the world was blinded to the abject horror of the concentration camps. Later movies and documentaries have never come close to the impact of this film for the reason that the directors have not had the stomach Alain had to use the actual Nazi footage from dachau, bergen belsen and other locations. That is what makes this film so shocking - it's real, not dramatized. No film library of WW2 is complete without it."
3,If you are a speed reader of poor quality (English) subtitles,"This is a very important film!However,If you do not understand rapid speaking French you better be a SUPER speed reader of extremly poor quality(English)subtitles which GREATLY distracts from the importance of this film.Ideally, this extremly important and visual film told in less than an hour should have been dubbed in all languages,it is that important of a film.J. Levin"
4,Disturbing and Unfathomable,"I can not post the first words that popped into my head, right after this movie was over; because it might offend some people. But wow! I have seen a good few of these movies on the subject of the concentration camps and wow, if you have never actually experienced it; this documentary really can bring you into the horrors that these people went through. I am dumbfounded on how any human being can treat another with such humility and am purely disgusted at the mere fact that this actually happened. Although a very heart wrenching subject to even talk about, this is a must see documentary. Because more than the disgust of this actually happening is to deny that this actually happened.... :("
3,Not the best out there.,The half hour run time was rather disappointing. They should however have an English voice over. It's kinda hard to watch piles of emaciated dead bodies being pushed into a mass grave while reading the subtitles. The music was really too upbeat in my opinion for what you're watching. The director seemed more like he was wanting to shock people instead of giving information on the Holocaust.
1,Disappointing,After watching this DVD I was so depressed and disappointing. There was nothing newand it wasn't well edited. I watched it and then I threw it away. Waste of moneyand my time.
2,More of the same.,"I brought this dvd after reading the stellar reports of other reviewers on Amazon. I didn't find this video in any way extraordinary, especially given the expense versus length (30 minutes). For this, I expected to see something not commonly portrayed in films and other media."
2,Definitely For Novices,"This book has such basic information that it's only useful for real beginners. Also, the authors are not the most highly rated sci fi writers in the industry. In fact, Van De Meer bores one silly."
2,Not quite as advertised,"Technical specs show this as a 6-foot cable, yet the one I received was only 4.5 feet.Also, on a WinXP Pro system, installation was not ""plug and play"". Some special printer property settings were required to install the printer on the USB port.Otherwise, it did work with an HP Laserjet 4 printer."
4,Worked great to connect old HP 6L printer to new Windows 7 computer,"This Belkin F5U002V1 USB Parallel printer adapter cable worked great to connect my old HP 6L laser printer to new computer running Windows 7 Ultimate. Plug and play installation for me. Connected parallel end to printer, then plugged usb end into new computer...powered on printer, and that was all I had to do. Windows 7 immediately recognized the printer, installed the correct printer driver, and was up and able to print pages within about 30 seconds! Yay!!! Would have given it 5 stars, except the cable I received is only 5ft long, not 6ft as described in item listing and cable itself is very lightweight. I've had this cable less than one day...but so far so good!"
5,works fine,"As with every vendor, from Apple to Zeos, I've heard both good and bad things about Belkin over the years. This cable works as advertised. It connects a very old Lexmark Optra to a Dell laptop running either XP pro and Ubuntu, and get trouble-free printing with the generic drivers in both OS's."
5,Belkin USB/Parallel Printer Adapter,I have a laptop and the printer plug I had would not fit in the laptop. I really didnt want to buy a new printer so I purchased this adapter. This is an excellent product. I didnt even need the disc that came with it. I have litte knowledge of the mechanics of computers/printers. But this product was easy and simple to install and it works great.
1,Not Vista Compatible,"I bought this from Amazon because it was Vista certified. After it failed to install I contacted Belkin. Their response is below.""Thank you for contacting Belkin Technical Support.We understand that F5U002 is not working with windows vista.F5U002 is not compatible with windows vista.""People also need to be aware that having a parallel to USB cable does not guarantee that a printer is supported in Vista. Most older HP printers are not, so even with the cable an old HP printer won't work. Before purchasing a parallel to USB cable check the manufacturer's web site first for Vista drivers (if your intention is to connect to Vista).I gave this item 1 star so people would read this review before buying it. I really have no basis for rating it."
5,It works,"I have an old HP Laserjet 6MP which has served as a workhorse for years, but when I upgraded to the new iMac with OS 10.6, Appletalk with the Assanté converter no longer worked, thus the printer couldn't work. I continued to use the printer with a laptop, but kept searching for a solution to make it fully functional. The Belkin F5U002V1 USB Parallel Printer Adapter cable did the trick. I plugged it in to the iMac and the printer (didn't need to use the installation mini disk), opened the printer system preferences and clicked to add a printer and voilá - the HP Laserjet 6MP showed up in the list. It worked immediately. The only hitch is that occasionally it doesn't print but I found that if I unplug the USB end and then plug it back in, it works. So nice to have my old printer back!"
1,absolutely NOT Vista compatible - waste of money,"I purchased this at a local office store and even called the Belkin sales department to ask if it was Vista compatible. The Sales department assured me I could download vista drivers from their website. No such luck. When I called Belkin tech support they told me it definitely was NOT compatible with Vista. Unfortunately, I had already cut the plastic package open. Now I'm out almost $50."
3,Didn't work,The item was fine except it did not work. My printer was too old to work with my new computer. I am having to return the item!Phyllis Ann Rose
3,Could be happier,"The bag itself is nice... when I bought my camera on line it was the one advertised by the Kodak company to go with the z980..for a much smaller camera this would be a ""good"" bag,for the one I bought it is a very tight & awkward fit , another bag would have been ""much"" better..also it could use some compartments for storage of ,batteries or extra memory cards. I am shopping for a another bag...."
3,Kodak Medium Camera Bag,It was a bit deceiving on the description of what camera would fit in this case. I have a Kodak with 30x zoom and it just fits enough that I can zip it. I plan on keeping it instead of going to the trouble of sending it back but I wish I would have known by the description that I needed a slightly larger case. The product did come on time and was in good condition so I gave it 3 stars.
4,Understanding Philanderers,"A therapist recommended I read this book and I have to thank her for that. Though some of the references to movies, books, seem a bit dated, overall it is very insightful into why people may cheat. Does not read as a text book so it actually is entertaining as well as informative.I won't say it will make up your mind about whether to stay married or cut your losses, that is a decision you have to make, but it will definitely help."
2,Rather dated and biased...,"This author is rather biased and seems to think that infidelity is never the cause of a divorce and that divorce is to be avoided at almost all costs barring physical abuse! His references are also rather dated, is very gender biased and he meanderes way too much.A much more useful reference on Infidelity is ""Sexual Detours"" by Dr. Hooly Hien"
2,Simplistic,"Pittman, like some other psychiatrists, likes to be able to put people and their actions into easy categories. Yes, people who have affairs, like people who fall in love, fall out of love, etc., behave in remarkably similar ways. That doesn't mean that those behaviors are necessarily wrong. I had an affair with a man who was/is verbally and emotionally abused by his wife. Her abuse was ""infidelity"" and a ""betrayal of trust"" long before he ""betrayed"" her by seeking love, acceptance and intimacy with me. And does Pittman think that the ""betrayer,"" my lover, wasn't agonizing over his own failures and responsibilities? Pittman's advice reiterates to me that there are psychiatrists out there who like to simplify all relationships so they don't have to do the hard work of helping their clients through serious emotional work and complicated psychological motivations."
4,Private Lies,"I highly recommend Private Lies for those who really want to understand what happens in infidelity and more so, WHY these things happen. This book is not your every day ""self help"" type of book. It really gets into the pyhsic behind what happens in infidelity. If you really want to go deep - read this book!"
1,"should be titled as a satire, not a self help book","I do not find most of the analogies in this book relevant to anything but an attempt at humor. Furthermore, I don't find the humor appropriate at a time of marital crisis. I cannot appreciate the fact that this book centers around an affair having to be sexual intercourse in order to truly be damaging.The text is confusing ato follow, I lose track of the names that have been appointed to the hurt partner, the unfaithful partner and the lover. I found myself skimming through most of the chapters as they were irrelevant.I bought this book in attempt to make sense of confusing emotions and to help me get my marriage and life back on track after my husband's affair was revealed. Which, I might add, included everything BUT intercourse, and lasted for a year while I was pregnant.This book might be remotely interesting to anyone that has never actually been devestated by an infidelity."
5,1*,If you carry or just own a firearm for self-defence this book is a must.It is more than just training by putting ammo downrange.It's about the attitude you need to come out on top. It makes you think.
3,Interesting... all about mental attitude,"Not sure what I was expecting... it is a good read, but it is all about your attitude and mental preparation.Not a lot technical on how to be a more accurate shooter."
4,Bought it as a gift,"I bought this as a gift, so I personally didn't read it but the receiver enjoyed it."
3,Good soild basics!,"Tiger Mckee draws from a wide range of experience in order to compile The Book of Two Guns. The information he shares with the readers is not only proven but practiced everyday by students of his trade. Tiger also brings together the concept of fighting with a firearm as many view fighting with the hand. Mental and emotional dedication are a must; going hand in hand with the skills illustrated in this book. Overall, a very strong book for beginners and for the experienced a refreshing look at some of the basics."
5,"original, informative, thought provoking","It is refreshing to see a book published in this format - hand written notes (well printed) by a student of the martial arts. This book is best read in small bites because of the density of material presented, and the format adds to this method of reading. A great change from the usual highly edited professionally packaged slick contentless dribble."
1,Was very dissappointed in this unit...,"We had this unit installed for a little over a year. Had a terrible time installing the unit. We had to purchase a special socket to be able to install. Had problems with water volume, even though we cleaned it throughly several times. Had problems with the wand retracting. The adjustment of the bracket for the faucet was so delicate to make this work we finally quite pulling it out. We had problems getting the water to shut off completely. FINALLY, we had had enough when I turned the water on one day and the handle fell off in my hands. The mechanism was made of a light weight plastic. We went to plumbing supplier and they said they had numerous returns on the unit. We then purchased a Kohler faucet and are very happy with the unit. We have had nothing but problems with MOEN faucets, in the kitchen or bathroom. I would not recommend them to anyone."
4,Decent Product -- Great Customer Service,I have had this faucet for three years. Recently it developed cracks and was leaking badly (too soon for my measure). I called Moen and they mailed me an entirely new faucet free of charge that I am very pleased with. Installation of the new faucet was very easy.
2,The handle cracked & faucet won't tighten to base,"I've had this unit installed for about 3 years. Within the first 10 weeks of use, hairline cracks developed on the handle around the spray toggle switch, and have grown worse over time.In addition, the faucet housing is loose on the base -- it can be easily rocked back & forth. I've tried to tighten it, and even had 2 plumbers look at it; neither were able to do more than hand-tighten it, due to an odd configuration of hot and cold water lines that suuround the washer bolt holding the faucet to the base from beneath, which prevents any conventional tool to access the bolt.Other than that, the unit works fine and is an attractive, ergonomic design."
1,Pay a little extra for better quality!,"I purchased this faucet 8 years ago when I built my home and had to completely replace it once. I had trouble with the second one too. The on and off handle broke at the base. I find the spout handle hard to get back into the holder once you remove it. The white piece at the top of the spout cracked and you must have really good water pressure to keep it in spray mode. Personally, I wish I would have spent the extra $100 and gotten a better quailty brand. I also purchased faucets with the white coating over the metal for my bathrooms and it cracked (more like crazed). I do give Moen an A+ for customer service though, they were wonderful."
3,cool but ?,We have a couple of these faucets in our new home. Its really cool and useful but we have diminished water pressure with it that we do not experience with other faucets in the house. Not quite sure what the problem is or if it is related to the faucets. These are great tho for bathing the dog!
5,This is really worth watching.,In my opinion this is one of the greatest films ever made. I don't think I've seen a film that reflects the life so perfectly. This movie was more entertaining to me than anything Fellini ever did.
2,Albert Camus Meets Stephen King,"I suspect that fans of Albert Camus and Stephen King would give more stars to this book. If you prefer protagonists who combat evil and overcome hardships, avoid this book. The book is set in California during the Depression. The book convincingly portrays the agony of the dust bowl victims who headed for California in the hope of starting a new life. Among the travelors is a man named Cooper. Cooper, to avoid a prison term, becomes a paymaster for an orange grower who employs and abuses migrant workers. A nanny employed by the orange grower believes that she has the power to control dead animals and dead people. Cooper, seemingly unable to control any circumstances, is driven by circumstances beyond his control into mental and emotional hell."
3,It was alright but not great,"I finished this novel a couple of days ago. Wasn't too thrilled with it and found it sort of boring. I couldn't get into the characters much but found that the descriptions were eerie and scary at times. Half way through was when I started to really like it but the beginning was sheer torture for me. I have some friends that love Jeter but I'm still struggling to get into this writer, he's good but not great in my opinion. I think I really need to try more of his books to really form an opinion of whether I like him or not though."
2,Not Worth Retail Price,"I've been sewing for almost 25 years, and even though it's billed as being a ""jeans machine"" it's not up to the task of thick fabrics or decorative trim. The bobbin tends to lock up and freezes the machine. This requires a complete disassembly of the bobbin housing and needle carriage (not as simple as popping the bobbin out, I mean unscrewing the entire bottom part of the machine).If you know how to take apart machines or are not intimidated by something that you'll spend more time repairing than you will sewing, by all means, go for it, but it will probably never do better than Halloween costumes or quilt block assembly, which are better served with a low-end overlock machine. It probably is a reasonable buy for an un-daunted sewer at a garage sale, but not worth the retail price.I had a much cheaper sewing machine in college - about $80 from a discount store - that lasted longer and outperformed this machine."
5,"Isidro Lopez ""El Indio""","I had the privilege of seeing him in the 60's he was great then, and this cd has brought alot of old memories back.The cd is worth twice the price.Just to hear that voice and music was a joy and trip through time is priceless. I just wish there was more music out there by him. If you want good music from one of the BEST 60's singers that ever lives, buy this CD it's worth every penny..Victor Pompa"
4,"No Problems, Good Service,","We have had no problems with this product. Also, the service was very good, and the product arrived on time."
4,Can't find OEM cartridges around here....,"....and as a matter of fact, it takes an hour drive to find a Moen product and even that store won't have OEM cartridges. All carry the aftermarket brand that all the big box and even small hardware stores stock. The OEM cartridge will last much longer - not sure how much yet because none have failed yet. Oldest is 2 years old. Last aftermarket cartridge dripped after 1 year. One fault they have in common is that despite having about 160 degrees of travel the difference between extremely hot and chilling cold is probably less than 5 degrees."
5,Moen Medora Faucet Drip an Easy Fix,"Our Moen Medora (7599) kitchen faucet was leaking and there are no washers to change. The Moen cartridge (1225) needs to be replaced. The trick is that you need the plastic adapter (included with the new cartridge) to remove the old cartridge. So don't bother taking apart the faucet until you get the new cartridge with the adapter. Don't try to pull the old cartridge out with pliers, you'll just make things worse. Take off the faucet handle from the top to get to the cartridge. All you need is a hex wrench, a screwdriver, adjustable wrench and about 20 minutes to fix the drip. Moen customer support was helpful and they also have a video on their website."
5,Moen 1225 one-handle replacement cartridge,Received the replacement cartridge when promised and as described. It was the proper replacement. Easy replacement and most certainly saved me a large bill from the local plumber.
1,You can get these for free from Moen...,"Call Moen at 1-800-289-6636. They have a very helpful and knowledgeable call center. Discuss your problem with them. If your problem warrants it, they will send you a new cartridge at no charge. Shipping is free. Just got 2 cartridges for the 2 sinks in my bathroom - they arrived within a week."
2,Not consumer friendly,"I live in a region where the water is very hard with lots of carbonate dissolved salts. Within a very few years all of my Moen faucets began sticking. I've replaced several cartridges with new ones and they did the same thing. These faucets were not leaking, just sticking. Upon closer examination of the cartridge I see it is composed of two main parts: the outer body of the cartridge and an inner stem. I tried an experiment and lubricated the rubber ""O "" rings of the inner stem with silicone grease and also the outer ' O ' rings and rubber inserts on the side of the cartridge. I reinstalled the old cartridge and it worked like a charm for several years when I had to repeat the procedure. Save the cost of a new cartridge if your faucet is not leaking and just buy some silicone grease and lubricate as instructed above."
4,THE CRRECT CARTRIDGE,"Following Moen's instructions,I purchased what I thought ws the correct cartridge. However, it turned out to be incorrect. So, I subsequently purchaced the correct unit(after removal of the old one). I never used the 1225 but subsequently bought a 1222 from Amazon."
5,faucet repair,"The big box stores have stopped stocking this product. It can still be found at Moen's website, but is much costlier with outlandish shipping charges. I was so happy to have found the product here."
2,Not the same quality as in the home improvement chains,"While these are made by Moen, they are either seconds or old stock. After 3-4 months, the lubrication goes away and it is difficult to operate the faucet. I thought the price was very good compared to Home Depot, and now I know why."
4,Moen 1225 Cartridge,My Moen Kitchen faucet started to leak and my wife needed answers on when I was going to replace it.The faucet is a single type with the sprayer built in and can be pulled out for rinsing pans.The faucet on Moen web was $400 and at HD or LWS was $250.I quickly bought all available replacement parts on Amazon for $38 which included the cartridge and the other parts kit which are availble and are a must buy as you get new washers .Overall it took about 2 hours to fully replace all however I could do it again now in about 45 mins.Worked for me however buy the puller as you will need it.Or pay a Plumber $65 to show up and get a view.
4,"It went in well, but started dripping 2 years later.",The replacement cartridge went in smoothly and fixed the drip. But since it started dripping again in two years I only gave it 4 stars. It's still cheaper than replacing the whole faucet though.
4,Worked for me,"Purchased this cartridge because it was a Moden OEM part. My Moen faucet is going on 15 years old and it had started to drip. It took all of about 5 minutes to put the cartridge in. I had no trouble getting the old one out or putting this one in.As others have mentioned it was backwards on the first try (hot was cold, cold was hot) so I had to remove it, turn it around and put it back in. Less than five minutes more doing that. I only gave it four stars because there ought to be a way to mark it so you don't have to do it by trial and error.All I can say to the folks that wrote saying they had trouble removing the old cartridge or installing the new one is read the directions (they are pretty good) and pay attention to the details. It isn't rocket science but you have to do it the way they tell you or you will have problems."
5,Works Great,"Moen product, so good quality. These used to be metal, but now parts of it are plastic, but it works well. Pre-lubed with silicone, so none needed. Just install as shown in the directions. I've done it before, so it's about a 3 minute procedure."
5,Classic Hemo!,"Hemo is a legend in Alaska, only family still living in ANWR.It's 100% worth it. Order some extras and send them to your friends."
4,Great toy for baby!,"The banana teething toy is great for my little guy who was about 4 months old when I bought it. He likes to hold it and chew on it and can pretty easily grasp it. I ordered the green bean at the same time, and like that one better. It's a bit smaller and easier for him to hold on to."
5,The only teether he likes,"I have bought so many teethers for my boy, and this carrot (and the beans) are the only ones he likes. He loves them! I put them in the freezer before giving them to him when we go out and that keeps him pretty happy. In fact, today I lost the carrot (and my husband lost the beans a couple of weeks ago) so I am buying them again."
5,My baby's favorite!,"My baby LOVED the carrot toy. He chewed on it all of the time, and I could just throw it in the wash machine to clean it. I love the Under the Nile fruit and veggies, now that my children are older, I continue to give them as gifts."
2,Not very colorful,A bit disappointed with the color - pretty dull compared to the one showed in picture. And the material is not soft.
4,cute but too big for 5-month old,I really love that these product are made out of organic cotton. I was looking for some soft toys for my daughter to chew on and based on reviews I chose the green bean. It's really cute but much bigger and thicker than I had expected. It's hard for my 5-month old to get a good grasp...maybe in a couple of months it will be easier for her.
1,Fascism and Mussolini -- the Luce story,"Although W.A. Swanberg does an admirable job of managing to write over 500 pages about Henry Luce, the man was naive, unpleasant and rude. The writing is decent, though not particularly engaging, and the story is hardly worth your time. If you enjoy ""Time Magazine"" and don't want your opinion marred, and if you are not one to appreciate Fascists and people who are too idealist to accept Mao after the fall of Chiang Kai-Shek, I'd stay away. If you are a Fascist with a lot of time on your hands, I would strongly recommend this book."
4,Small T-Fal skillet,"I was looking for a small nonstick fry pan. This fit the bill perfectly and I am very pleased with it. Just right for one or two eggs or the toasted cheese sandwich. Good price, too."
2,Not as shown,"This product was not as it is pictured. There was no gold trim on it, and the stain on it was put on unevenly. My young grandson could have done a better job finishing it."
5,"Geneva 9.5"" Wood Wall Clock","This is a very nice clock for the money. It keeps great time. I recieved it in great condition. This clock matches my kitchen cabinets very well, {it hangs on my kitchen wall]."
5,A beautiful looking clock!,"This is a beautiful looking clock, and it's very economical, too! I have it on my living room, later to be put on the bathroom wall, and it's very easy to read. It even has that quaint ""ticking"" for each move of the second hand, but it's just pleasant and not too loud."
5,Tatu Rocks,Can you speak Russian? It does not matter. Tatu has come out with yet another CD of hot music full of raw engery.
2,left me flat,"I really wanted to like this book, and am surprised by the three amazing reviews on it. My main issue with the book is that I couldn't buy into the central premise, that a lawyer (father of a murdered son), would go from harassing the DA to seek the harshest jail time for his daughter in-law to becoming her lawyer and biggest fan with NO PROOF, in fact nothing changes other than she asks him to be her lawyer, and suddenly he's a changed man??!! Also not only is he not a defense lawyer, he's a former prosecutor, and the one time he tried to be a defense lawyer he failed miserably. It just makes no logical sense to me, and when you can't see the main character as a real person the book falls apart and you truly don't care what happens."
3,okay,"This sword is a decent prop but not very sturdy and breaks easily when used for swordfighting (which they always are, eventually.)"
3,Dressed to Kill,"In my recent Amazon package of Fox's latest noir titles favorites was a flyer announcing the Michael Shayne Collection Vol 1 to be released in 2007, no month given. Neither were any titles listed so I can't tell you if they will include the Lloyd Nolan early titles or the later Hugh Beaumont (Beavers Dad, ""Leave it to Beaver) titles...In that they specify Vol 1; one could presume there's going to be a Vol II and so on...one would hope. Probably depends on how Vol I sells."
1,whoops,"I suspect this is a perfectly fine tape, the problem is that it's the wrong one. ""Dressed to Kill"" was the name of a Sherlock Holmes movie with Basil R, and that's the movie I received... but, I thought I was buying the Michael Shayne movie with Lloyd Nolan - that was what was advertised, though the photo on this page says otherwise. This is the first such error I have encountered out of many many purchases, so I'm not in distress. -guym"
2,DRESSED TO KILL,THE STORY WAS ABOUT AVERAGE FOR A MANTAN MORELAND MOVIE AND WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER HAD NOT PARTS OF THE MOVIE BEEN OF SUCH POOR QUALITY - PARTS WERE ALMOST ALL DARK GREY WITH THE IMAGES BARELY DISCERABLE.
4,Nice book,"This book is pretty good, very ""poetic"", but I believed it was a boardbook...my mistake, my daughter is still a little to young to be able to watch this book by herself, but I still can read it to her:-)"
3,I agree!,I thought j haslam's review of his own book below was inspiring and has it has changed my life. I bow to his high-tech genius. please don't remove it.
2,not what i expected at all,"im sorry but it is way smaller than what it looks like in the photo. when it arrived it was very sloppy the wrapping was torn, everything was opened and everywhere in the box. i will not be purchasing from this seller again."
5,It rocked my world all over!,This is the best book I've ever read. It was fantastic and very short. I would recommend it to evryone I know. It an hour of horse lovin delight.
4,Very nice instrumental piano,"This is a gorgeous listen. There are no vocals here just lovely instrumental piano.Sweeten's fingers dance over the keys in a way that makes me want to close my eyes and image gliding across a ballroom in a huge dress with jewelry dripping off me (and I'm not even that girly).The tracks have names like ""Walking with the Wind"", ""In the Shadows"", ""Thin Ice"" which make me feel more like I ought to be picturing nature or wilderness instead of ballrooms, and maybe the next time I listen I will. But for now this is just what I need."
1,Blah to the remixers,"Did you know that Toni Basil doesn't see a cent from the sell of this CD? Actually, she hasn't seen a cent at all since she released the song in the 80s!Teh remixes here are crap. Let's face it. They should ahve at leased included the original version. These supposed dance remixes are just repetitive. I can't really tell the difference between the last 3.Avoid this CD. There is ONLY one version to listen to--the original."
3,Great for Cheerleaders,I bought this disc in hopes of using it for a cheerleading dance routine. The first two remixes on the CD were worth it but the others were kind of cheesy. I'd recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of the original but wants to speed it up to a club-music tempo.
1,Bleeccchhh,"Being a fan of the original version, and loving remixes of almost anything, I picked this one up without hesitation. What a waste. This is pure cheese 100%. Some songs need not be remixed. This is one of those songs."
2,Terry Burrows missed the Big One,"Oh my, time to repent..lol..Hey, this book contains a lot of information. Unfortunately, you forgot who Frank Zappa said reinvented electric guitar! Eddie Van Halen...Everyone from Steve Vai to Jeff Beck to Jimmy Page to Eric Clapton to Pete Townshend and many more call Eddie the INNOVATOR, and the man that started the new revolution..Again, the great Frank Zappa said Eddie reinvented electric guitar! He has been called the most influential and innovative guitarist since Hendrix..I know Steve Vai and Satriani are PHENOMENAL, but you have made a grave error..Eddie was the first..After 1978, the rules of rock music, as well as rock guitar, CHANGED FOREVER...Not bad for a guy who never had a guitar lesson and BUILT his own guitar from second hand parts and painted it with Schwinn bicycle paint..lol..And hey, where was Rhandy Rhoades too? damn.."
1,Don't buy this,"Poor film quality, poor filming. I was not impressed with this video at all. Cameraman zooms in at strange times so you can't see what's going on. 100% amateur work. I also own one of the Larry Metz films and it's 10 times the film this is. Knowing how to process deer doesn't mean you know how to make a movie about it. I had always wondered how meat cutters can do it so fast. This film answered that question. They don't trim anything."
2,Not what I was looking for,"The video is ""grainy"" and the production value is low. There is some good information but you cannot see the process as well as I had hoped. This is a good product to give you an idea of what you will need to do but do not bank on this one to have youself ready to go."
3,"So, So,....Soul","I was greatly dissappointed by this ""Soul Collection"" by the Drifters!! It definitely wasn't their best work!! The sound wasn't that great either!! I don't want to ""put it down"" too far.....for I am a lover of Soul Music!! But...like I said: It's just So..So...!"
1,rubber dissolves after 2 years,"I bought one of these korky brand flappers and the rubber dissolved completely after 2 years, coming disconnected from the support. There should be a product recall. If the house happens to be empty when it falls apart (like a vacation house) you cold be stuck with a nasty water bill."
3,Can you say sweet,"I think that this chili is an aquired taste. The first time was ugh, gonna have to throw these away. The second time eating it was better. I think this could be a really good product if they dropped the sugar content down. The spicyness is a good warm feel. but not take your breathe away hot by any means. It was also a little thinner than I had hoped for, I tend to like my chili thicker so it stays piled up on a spoon. Overall the taste of the spices were pretty good, except for the sugar of course."
5,"Quite Good For A Canned Chili. Spicy, But Not Overly So.","My nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market carries a lot of gourmet and health-related items and I like to try them. One I picked up recently was Amy's Organic Chili. I bought both the regular and the spicy varieties and I'm reviewing the spicy one here. It's quite good for a canned chili. I'd say it's at least as good as any other canned brand I've ever tried. Plus it's fairly low in fat and seems to lack that oily topping I associate with canned chili. I't's a little higher in sodium than I'd like, but not by much. The taste is quite good. It's somewhat zesty but I'd rate the spicyness as mild. The meat is ground and occurs as tittle interspersed grains rather than larger chunks. Of course, it's organic. I've always liked chili and this is a good one that I can keep stashed in my pantry. Amy's is a good brand and I'm very satisfied.Gsry Peterson"
4,"Tasty, though a bit pricey","This chili is pretty tasty, and it's a great option for people who are vegetarian or vegan but who don't have the time, skills, or desire to cook for themselves. I wouldn't describe this chili as spicy, but I think that's might be more of a personal taste. My one qualm is that this chili is a bit expensive at about $3.00/can. When I bought the case at Costco, it was probably about a dollar cheaper per can, but overall a decent value, as one can=one meal for me."
1,Bland and absolutely awful.,"This product was so bland i could not add enough salt. Also the taste and texture is just awful. The kind of product that gives tofu a bad name, if I had eaten this first I would never eat anything with tofu again!!I find myself gagging a little just thinking about eating this product it really was that bad.Sorry"
1,poor description of contents,the game disk is full of demos with time limitsthis is a BIG DURN RIPPPP OFFthought amazon watched their sellers betterthey lost me and quite a few other customers with the negative aspect of their adsi can not trust them
5,Great Action + Wonderful Romance,"This is the sequal to ""The Scarlet Pimpernel."" It is a truely wonderful book that any action lover would like. Chauvelin is as crafty as ever and Marguerite is as beautiful and devoted to Sir Percy Blackeney, her oh so fashionable dandy and wealthy husband. If you have seen A&E's version this is the book you will find closest to it. Good reading!"
4,Fun read,"As someone aspiring to read Spanish, this is an excellent book. The vocabulary is not too difficult and it is a good light read."
3,Crusades: A Poisonous Chalice Drunk to the Bitter End,"The Crusades Crescent & the Cross, a two-DVD set by The History Channel, gives a satisfactory overview of the first three crusades in Volume I. The program would have gained in credibility by giving a more balanced view of the underlying events. The crusades were first and foremost an answer to the relentless advance of Islam in the Near East. However, The History Channel rightly highlights the atrocities that crusaders committed against Muslims, Jews, and some fellow Christians during the crusades. Volume II contains an interesting overview of the religious, military order of the knights Templar. The bonus program called ""History in the Making: The Crusades"" in Volume II does not add anything significant to the narration of the first three crusades. Most viewers probably do not care too much about how The History Channel produces Volume I."
4,Jihad Forever,"By providing a collage of doco, cinematography and to date journalistic features created of and in different timings, this movie educates on The Crusades and then epoch and peoples very much.It bridges the past with the very future by including contemporary interviews of Tariq Ali, for instance, known already for his book ""The Clash of Fundamentalisms: Crusades, Jihads and Modernity"" and cinematographic cooperation withDerek Jarman."
1,not a history of anything but Islamic propaganda,"Absolute rubbish. I'm a medieval history PhD student and this was worse than most of the History Channel's nonsense. If you think you'll learn anything about the history of the Crusades from this empty bombast, then you're quite gullible indeed."
2,Biased,"They portray Richard The Lionheart as a brave warrior who would fight in the midst of battle but Saladin as a barbarous, pompous man who would just sit there and loot riches instead of the great, handsome man he was."
4,History Channel Excellent as always,Very good overall history of the Crusades. After watching Kingdom of God is was great to have a real history perspective. Very Good.
3,History on a small budget.,"In the era of computer generated armies, dinosaurs, and natural disasters, a fine story deserved a little more umph. It was very obvious that the History Channel did not have the means to duplicate the impact of motion pictures like Kingdom of Heaven. I had a feeling I was watching 20 high school students acting a period piece. The thousands of crusading soldiers attaking Saladin's army looked more like 50 out of work extras doing their best.Visually a disappointment, but the story remains as relevant now as the year 1097 ."
3,The History Channel Presents The Crusades - Crescent & The Cross,A good production. The cinematics and special effects improved the documentary immensely. I wish that there was a little more depth as to how the muslims rose to power in the middle east before the crusades. It would help to clarify the christian views of why going to war was considered necessary. Also a bit more balance of the christian point of view vs. the muslim point of view would have been nice.
2,"David, avid reader of the Crusades","I was completely disatisfied. If you want do learn the truth about the crusades don't watch this, read a book. This was brought to you by atheists and made to look like the Muslims were the good guys when both sides at times weren't.Facts are also left out. Prior to the first crusade Muslims burning of the Holy Sepulcher, the church that was built on the site of Christ's empty tomb ,Muslims shutting out Christians who seek pilgrimage to Jerusalem.It doesn't even acknowledge Saladin's siege of Jerusalem.It makes the viewer think that he took it without a shot being fired.Etc,Etc!The reenactments looked fake and the knight's uniforms and placement in battle were wrong.I was realy hoping the documentry was going to begreat but it fell extremely short."
1,Definitely one-sided,I agree with others here that have said that it was pro-Islam.It leaves out whole chapters in the history of why they were fighting.They made the muslims look like the good guys & the Christians were taking over their land -excuse me -who was there first? Mind you I'm an atheist but I love the truth & not some political correct bs.
2,Muslim PC Crap,"Although most of the facts were correct (legalistically), the spirit of the documentary was framed in PC terms, and hijacked by a pompous, final ""authority"" on the crusades, a muslim scholar from the UK.In particular, the muslim scholar (I forgot his name) was a narrow-minded, intolerant, and prejudiced individual. I especially detested the callous disregard of the meaningful contributions that the Catholic Church made to protect innocent Christians from persecution. Many of these persecuted Christians had roots that went back hundreds of years in areas that were ""Islamitized."" Moreover, the Catholic Church, protected Christian pilgrims: an honest, God-fearing people.P.S.: In case you're wondering I'm not Catholic. This documentary just pissed me off with it's historical revisionism."
1,Can there be a 0 star rating?,I bought this book because it includes a source disk and I did'nt want to reinvent the wheel in BASIC. What a drag to debug this code to get the calculations correct. It would have been faster for me to write it up from scratch!There are no meaningful comments in the code nor any clue in the text.A complete waste of time and money.
1,This a book for Basic not Visual Basic,"The title indicates the book uses Visual Basic. The back covers says programs will also run in Qbasic. This was a great programming language, but this book fails to use any of the modern programming features of Visual Basic. A real disappointment."
1,Errors in code listings and no comments to help correct them,"Too many code errors and very little help on how to correct them. The theory behind the code is extremely sketchy. Hence, the main reason to buy this book would be the included diskette containing the mathematical algorithms, but those too are erroneous. Suggest writing routines for oneself rather than investing in this book."
4,Relatively nice book,Before using algorithms one should check code first. Otherwise pretty nice solutions. Recommendable for reading.
1,Shallow and Scarce--Students were not engaged,"I bought this DVD to show to my Spanish classes during our fiesta del Dia de los Muertos. However, the video was not as informative as I would have liked. There are a lot of traditions that could have been shown and explained in more detail to make this video better instead of focusing on individual testimonials. Also, they could have taken this video into the heart of Mexico to gather more footage instead of Southern California, but instead they created a film that in some way lacks true authenticity and depth. In addition, there were times when I thought they put way too much emphasis on the performance of a certain band. Watching them on stage seemed to be a major filler for dead time in this video in lieu of thoroughly exploring the history, traditions, and celebration of this Spanish holiday. I would NOT recommend this video if you want a well-rounded explanation for students."
1,Day of the Dead video,"I am a high school Spanish teacher and bought this video to show on the Day of the Dead, but honestly, it is quite boring and does not do a very good job of making this fantastic holiday come to life."
3,Day of the Dead,This video was interesting but not one that I would show in a classroom setting. I tried to show it to my high school Spanish 1 class but the students were not interested. If you are interested in Day of the Dead and how it is celebrated here in CA then it is useful but I don't recommend this for classroom education.
1,An Absolutely Terrible Text,"Simply stated, this is the worst textbook I have ever used or seen in my life. Poorly organized and terribly written, this text may be fine for someone who has already had linear algebra and wants a compact review of the material, but it is an absolutely terrible source to learn from. The author does an incredibly poor job of explaining the concepts and mathematics behind linear algebra, forcing the student to learn the material completely on his own using other sources. My professor remarked one day that this is the best book on the market. If so, the market is in a very sad state right now. Do yourself a favor and get another book, and if you're a professor, for the love of your students and mathematics, DO NOT USE THIS BOOK IN THE CLASSROOM."
1,THIS BUCK [is bad]!!!!!!!!,"I gave this book one star only becasue there was no 0 star rating, this is the worst math book I have ever used. It is poorly written, there are lots of mistakes( which to this date 05/29/03, that have not been correted on the authors' web page). This book was poorly organized, over priced, and had a weak book binding (my copy began to fall apart!!).Please do not buy this book, unless you like to waste your money on useless material."
1,Awful book,"This book is horrible. Not only does it do an awful job of teaching you linear algebra, but the book itself falls apart pretty easily. Now I'm stuck with this (way to expensive) book and I won't be able to sell it since people tend to like the pages to be in the book when they buy it. For the record, I do like linear algebra, but that interest was developed by my professor but not by this book in any way."
1,agreed! worse math book EVER written,"this is by far the worse math book I have ever read in my life! not only is it hard to learn from the book due to the errors and bad workings, but the examples done in the book do NOT help at all with the problems, and solutions given in the book are so few. STAY AWAY from this book, the author does not deserve your money!"
1,"As a textbook, of no value","You will love to attend lectures after getting this book.Because it teaches in a way of confusion, while I can see the author knows the material very well, I would assume this is not written for students. (what for? ask the author.)Since the book is so unclear and off the point, it does offer examples. Examples that doesn't relate to the practice problems at all.I have no other problem with my calculus book and I'm not a lazy student. I only use this book as a practice problem source. (Otherwise I'll be confusing myself truthfully, it always make the material harder, while my professor can make it easier) A good lecture and a helpful professor, that's all I'm counting on.Do not get this book, do yourself a favor! I'll be reselling it to Amazon right after I'm done with LA I&II.; I don't sell books for the most of the time (I consider them as a fortune), but not this one."
5,Goats of the World Great information Background and Plates,"This book had some great background information on goats in general, was very nicely arranged (by region of the world) as well as description of the goats. The pictures were great. This book overall is good for anyone that has an interest in the caprine world as well as the common animal enthusiest (sp?)Zeke"
5,Fun to Read,"This book is fun to read and the illustrations are great! Anyone who enjoys reading historical information would also enjoy this book. The descriptions are detailed and the depth of information provided is a joy to those who enjoy raising goats and other livestock. This would be a good book for people researching agriculture and geographical cultures, as well.Very enjoyable reading and looking at the many graphics, maps, and pictures."
5,worth waiting for,An outstanding book on the subject. The illustrations are perfectly done. I wish more books of this excellence and scholarship were written on the topic. It is well worth the price. Sarah Baumgartner
3,Another good read from Tamar Myers,"I have followed this whole series, and this is on par with the others. Abby continues the new life in Charleston, while we get to know a little more about Abby's brother and Wynnell's husband as Abby tries to save her friend Wynnell from being convicted of murder. Much of the book seems to avoid dealing with the old characters (such mama, Greg, and Wynnell). In other situations, it appeared that some characters were introduced for a purpose (such as the lawyer), but not much was done with them in the end. There are a few twists that make this an interesting read. The humor typically comes from Abby's sassy remarks, as always, but the humor starts to wear off after awhile."
1,Was the Author phoning it in?,"I don't ask much of a cozy mystery, but Tamar Myers' Statue of Limitations just doesn't measure up to even my low standards. Written in the first person, this series milks the Southern Lady shtick for all it's worth, but the routine is neither charming nor winsome. Perhaps it's the sloppy editing (Rhubarb ""tort;"" motion alarm ""censor;"" ""to reproof"" instead of ""to reprove"") or the the slow pace, but I am quitting on page 201 of 353. Just can't bring myself to care who conked the socialite with the garden statue of David at the Charleston B&B."
3,Thought It Was Just Ok,I thought this book was just ok. Didn't think it was anything special. At times this author reminded me of Janet Evanovich's wisecracking nosy characters but then the plot would falter or the characters would change. I think part of the problem is this is the first book of the series I've read and from reading the other reviews the earlier books were stronger and more interesting. I think I'm going to try at least one of them because of the glimpses of good storytelling I found in this book. I didn't hate this book. I actually liked it but just felt there could have been so much more that the author could have done with it. I'm not going to write a plot summary since Amazon and other reviewer have already did this. I just didn't like how it seems like the author would introduce characters and give them a role then forget them. I think I would want to try the other books in this series first before I recommend this book. It's not a great book as a stand alone.
1,Seller is a thief!!!,"The seller did not send the 3 items I paid for. The seller only sent 2 of the items, and one of them was incorrect. They have not responded to my emails. I have been ripped off!!! Do not purchase from Intrepid Business!!! Amazon is getting a bad name for sponsoring them as well."
1,Arrived damaged,"This item arrived with a chip in the enamel. Also, it arrived in a generic bubble sleeve with no identifying product information, brand name, etc. This made me wonder if I had been sent a returned item minus the original product packaging. I am returning it and will not reorder."
5,Works perfect!,I purchased this because I wanted to be able to make my own lemonade. This squeezer is heavy duty but not difficult at all to use. I can't imagine why anyone would give this a bad rating. It works perfect. It gets ALL the juice from the lemon. I'm never buying frozen lemonade again!
5,Nice lemon squeezer,Very solid and well made. Love the fact its dishwasher safe. Had a different model that wasnt and the finish came off in the dishwasher and I had to discard it.
5,Wonderful Candy Mold,Every year I make a cake for Christmas featuring the Nativity in some sort. I found this mold that was extremely easy to use. I used white chocolate on a dark chocolate frosted tier cake and the effect was beautiful! I even used this to make candies for some children in my Sunday School class and they loved them. It is a simple way to bring the birth of Jesus back into the focus of Christmas.
5,U.S. Fan,To Answer Kerry(The Last reviewer)We do like Will Young in America.I have heard very little of His music and would buy it all but cannot afford the Import prices! So Please release in the U.S. Will and We will buy it all!!!But From the songs I've heard He is great and a Big Talent!!!!JonathanJettNJett@aol.com
5,Big Bill's #4 of 2001,"You've got to order this CD to fully understand just how good it is. On paper, one may describe them as a basic rock/alternative/power pop combo with good melodies and cool keyboards. However, the execution behind all these great songs is absolutely incredible. Although fully original, comparisons could range from Big Star, to Thin Lizzy, to Badfinger. Track #1 Everything Hits at Once would be a mega-huge hit if radio stations weren't so intent on playing music like Staind and Creed. Other great tunes include #6 Anything You Want, #4 Lines In the Suit, and the killer instrumental track #10, This Book is a Movie. Hearing this band makes you say: ""There's just something about them""."
3,lets not get ahead of ourselves,"To be kind, about half of the material here is cool. The rest is pretty boring. This is actually my least favorite Spoon album. The first 4 songs are really catchy and have an ""edgy"" feel. I don't know what about the lyrics are ""literate"" though. See--the song about the fitted shirt and how they don't know how to make shirts (which I agree with) so he'll stick with his dad's old clothes. ""Kill the Moonlight"" does what what their going for on this album much better I think. The earlier albums are rougher, quicker, more ""rock"" oriented. Check out ""telephono"""
3,Girls can Tell,"The Spoons hail from Austin, Texas and the CD was recommended to me by a friend who hails from that town. I am not saying that he was listening through 'rose tinted glasses'!!? but the record didn't quite live up to the way it had been described. Nevertheless very good listening."
3,great lyrics but underwhelming sound,There no denying the presence of the singer and the lyrics are great. But it also sounds like the band is not quite up to the task of doing something interesting with the singing and lyrics. It all just misses. The drummer is especially banal but the guitar-work isn't much better.
2,A disappointment,A bland and immature exercise. Full of songs that just go nowhere. One repetitious riff does not a song make.
5,So understated that it cannot be overlooked,"I find it very hard to write a review of this album. I know that it's one of my favorite CDs right now, but I can't really express why. The songs in and of themselves are not unorthodox or different, yet something about them is just wonderful and addictive to listen to. I especially like ""Everything Hits At Once"", ""Me and the Bean"", ""Fitted Shirt"", and ""Take a Walk"". ""Take the Fifth"" can get somewhat annoying after repeated listens, but the rest of the album is constantly listenable. There's something about the understated vibraphone trills and just the right amount of electric guitar that makes this album not too loud and distorted, yet not too soft (though I do enjoy music on both sides of the spectrum). This album is just...right. Anyone who likes unique Indie rock should give this album a try. It's a gem."
5,Good hat,"Very well made, fit feels much better than your other hat styles/brands. Just wish my dog wouldn't have chewed it up..."
5,excellent choice,this is a classy vest and tie for formal to evening attire to going out clubbing and knowing how to dress it down and look classy!
5,Security in a New Light,"Since 9/11, the security industry has been evolving. The need for standards in the industry is imperative and this book discusses a varity of industries and their standards of care. This book is a great reference for anyone in any industry that is looking for information on security. Building Security: Handbook for Architectural Planning and Design is a must have."
2,Analysis is needed before classifications,"What I got from the book is some private impressions not really security design. I don't deny that it contains some useful tips but I can not depend on the book as a reference in my work as a security consultant.I liked the way of presenting facts, but we need modularization.Another thing, the book tried to deal with everything but actually you missed most important detailed things (a jack of all trades is master of none) and also nothing mentioned about important sites like telecommunications stations and maritime."
4,gift for a friend...,"she seemed happy with itit's quite pretty, material is softgot it for a good pricedefinitely a good purchase"
4,Definitely worthwhile for video,"OK, it's not an super high end/expensive item, but for anyone with a real world budget, this is pretty good. I was very surprised at how big an improvement it made in watching video (once I got the settings and levels right on my receiver). The purchase is entirely worthwhile. Dialog is noticably clearer than simply running the video sound thru my main speakers (and mine are pretty high end). For anyone whose stereo budget is under $5k this is a very useful addition, in my opinion. Even in a higher end system it may fit in, for any but the super picky and hyperwealthy."
4,bad shoe dye,i apply boot polish to shine and protect shoes coloring rub off. as if it were not dye properly. the shoes themselfs are fine.
1,Embarassingly bad,"Try wrapping your brain around this sentence:""Unless the hardware and firmware release levels are inventoried and tracked in conjunction with the network, the NAS systems become unassociated storage servers unbound to the confines of the network in which they operate.""Or this:""The corollary, or trade-off to this condition, is the economics of speed and capacity to price.""I'm sure the contributors worked very hard to fill up the 526 pages of this book, but oh dear, oh dear, oh dear....."
4,"For Indian standards, a progressive love story","Had seen this movie via rental & was impressed w/ the storyline and the depiction of the characters - very tastefully done. So, purchased it (as is my habit)."
4,unique story,"As usual i always love to see Rani starring at any movie, i like to see her pair up with this guy they seems so match each other instead with shakrukh khan.dvd quality is good i dont hav complain, story is unique and setting was nice."
4,Powerful breastroke,"This dvd is about 6 focus points of powerful breastroke: streamlining whilst gliding, pointing toes to the sides and then kick, closing feet together after kicking thus hiding it before the next cycle of kicking, jumping up and front to get the maximum head pull, dive to the front rather than down thus channeling energy to the front, and wide and fast armstroke.But to be fair, Amanda stated that some of the techniques are especially her own style and not for everybody.This video has helped me in achieving fast breastroke, fast enough to challenge a decent freestylist at 50m just by applying fast start-up, powerful kick and streamlining, and with just an average of 8 strokes per 25m length."
1,Sondheim's Worst!,"Normally, I love Stephen Sondheim's work. I consider Company, Follies, Night Music, Sunday in the Park, Pacific Overtures, Into the Woods, Sweeney Todd, and even the much derided shows Anyone Can Whistle and Bounce. But this one is...BAD. Yes, I just criticised Stephen Sondheim. I literally could not finish the show. The story is weak, the script sounds like it was done by Andrew Lloyd Weber (from me, that's as low a blow as you can get) and the lyrics, usually Sondheim's showcase, are clumsy and ineffective. The whole show has a breathy, affected air which ruins any pretense of true passion. The only good thing about the show is the logo."
4,Easier to follow than the cast album,"I liked this musical very much! I remember watching the Tony Awards the year that the original production won the Award for Best Musical over ""Beauty and the Beast""--the more likely contender for the top prize; and I thought it was a mistake until I had seen the original cast program. I had only heard the cast album of ""Beauty"" and once I saw ""Passion"" I saw ""Beauty"" as an overblown, juvenile production for the kiddies and I don't see how it could have been nominated. I think that Jere Shea is very good-looking gentleman with a good voice as Georgio, Marin Mazzie is a beauty of an actress as Clara and then there is Donna Murphy in her Tony Award-winning performance as Fosca, the unattractive yet passionate older woman reaching out desperately for Georgio's love. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Sondheim--the Broadway genius who wrote the score."
5,A stunning musical,"I first found out about Passion as an avid Donna Murphy fan and i was once again not dissapointed by her performance or by the show itself. This is the most moving musical i have ever seen. Stephen Sondheim has once again struck gold with this beautiful and heart wrenching love story.Donna Murphy deserved the 1994 Tony that she won for this performance and the way this was filmed her acting really shines. Her facial experesions and the emmotion that she taps into is phenomenal, and it is such a difference from other roles she has taken on (ex: Ruth Sherwood in Wonderful Town or Anji in Star Trek Insurrection) and this is a true testement to her acting ability.I recomend this to any musical lover or anyone who loves a great and moving love story."
5,amazing history - we need more of this,"this is what music theatre can do. move you. make you smile, and cry....and think.The DVD is amazing. In quality, performances, editing, and the audio commentary. If you claim to love musical theatre. and say that you want new works to happen..this is for you."
5,Bible prophecy at its best!,"Although the book was wriiten over 100 years ago, and some of the resources quoted are outdated for our day, the principle behind this volume and its subject of armageddon is amazing!The author has deep insight into the deep things of God, much of what he has forseen in scripture has been fulfilled, and continues to be fulfilled. The verse-by-verse commentary on ""The Lord's Great Prophecy"" of Matthew 24 and 25 is insightful and an asset to those student of end time prophecy."
1,Completely inaccurate,"Just a very poor ""article"". The views are outdated and lack scientific rigour on a very basic level. I couldn't recommend this to anyone."
4,Good band work,"The quality of the dvd is good and all members of the band had made an excellent performance. Undoubtedly, which is able to meet the requirement of Allan Holdsworth's fans."
5,Visual Bible 3-Episode Set,"This is a great product,really makes the bible come alive --the whole chapter acted out word for word. My religious ed students loved it. Can't wait for the rest of the Gospels to be produced. the only draw back is in the Gospel of John the chapter and verse is not displayed at the bottom of the screen as it is in Matthew"
4,The Visual Bible- A MUST!,The visual bible is a great tool! The acting isn't as bad as someone thought here (in my opinion) and while the actor for Christ is no Jim Caveziel...it's really quite sufficient. For today's media driven generation (especially teens) this is PERFECT! You can also watch it by chapter and verse so it's easy to stop and pick up where you left off or just focus on one parable/passage.
5,Visual Bible is Great,"I use these videos to teach Bible studies. Scripture is verse for verse, and dramatizing is great. Everyone loves this form of Bible study."
4,"Very nice set, good price","This set contains 3 movies based word-for-word on the NIV - New International Version -Bible of the Books of Matthew, Gospel of John and Acts. My favorite is the Gospel of John, I like the way the actor portrayed Jesus. Acts is very good too. I love the way Dean Jones as the Apostle Luke narrates and weaves the story together. These dramatized movies really help bring out things that one misses in just reading these Books of the Bible. They also have Spanish with English substitles - good for practicing either language. I don't think I've watched Matthew all the way through yet.Overall I would recommend getting the set."
2,Playback pauses and freezes,"The videos were delivered promptly, and I eagerly popped the first disc of ""Matthew"" in my player. All was fine for the first half of the disc, then the playback began to pause momentarily. By the end of chapter 10, playback pretty much ceased. Ditto disc 2.Tried the next set, ""John"". Pretty much the same story. Contacted Amazon, they said replacement discs were not available, though to be fair, they did offer a refund. Don't want a refund; I really like the DVDs. Next step, copy to my computer and see if they play from there."
1,not worth buying,"An audio version of the bible would be better. The terrible acting is a distraction. It is sad that there is no money or good dirctors for religious movies. Also, most Christian movies start with more ads than any other kind of movies. These should be thrown out with the money changers! So disappointed I had to write my first review."
5,Excellent service!,"Being in Britain I was unable to purchase replacement blades for my Philips HP Series Shaver since about 1990, maybe even earlier. I bought the shaver in the late 1970s. I thought, why buy a new shaver when all I need are new heads? I continued using the same shaver heads I bought in the early 1980s. I'd tried to buy new ones about 1990, but they were obsolete by then. However, when I went on the internet I found a company in the US which had a few sets of blades, so I bought a set and had it sent to a friend there, who then mailed it across to Britain. From the order to my receiving the shaver heads was less than two weeks. I'm so grateful to the Goodmans company for sending my order so quickly. So I'm now using my 1970s shaver with brand new blades, having finally taken the old ones out after using them continuously for approaching 30 years! Is this a record?Dave Strickland, Doncaster, England"
2,Norelco Shaver Heads-Not Sharp,"Noreclo 1912 Shaver Head Set, HP Series Replacement are not as sharp as we though they would be. Perhaps they have been used before shipped? Factory rejects?"
5,Paco Rabanne,My purchase was easy and efficient. I received my order in less time than expected and was very happy with the product.
1,Poor deal even for the money,"This is NOT the ninth you want, the name William Bolden is a pseudonym for Alberto Lizzio, i believe, but the main thing to know is that this is poorly recorded and a poor performance, there are some Very good budget Beethoven Ninths available by proven conductor, i would recommend George Szell as an excellent place to start"
2,Spirit Horses,Misleading - Linda Kohanov only wrote the Intro.Repetitive photographs and sparse text.
2,Spirit Horse,"I am an equine artist, and bought this book for the photography. I found it to be very poor. A lot of the pictures were bland, uninteresting, and many were out of focus. I resold the book."
2,less than stunning,The photographs are mostly in browns and beiges like old stylephotography. There is also too much repetition in my opinion.I was expecting color and drama and felt disappointed.
5,A True Sense Of Spirit,"I have never met Tony Stromberg, even though we share the same name. His work ""Spirit Horses"" however, captures the passion, freedom and spirituality of these magnificant creatures, and that photography speaks volumes about the man himself. Mr. Stromberg has, through this photographic glimpse into the very soul of horses, put us all in a better place as we journey across the plains with each turned page.In viewing this beautiful book, I got a sense of the message that the horse communicates to us about the simple truths of life, and it sits on our coffee table for all to enjoy.Thank you Tony, what a gift to all of us!"
5,The spirit of the horse...,"While there are a lot of romantic horse picture books available, Tony has collected many images in this book which transcend the expected and lead us into the essence of equine. The textures and composition amaze... From the dust, to the lips, to the eyes, to the hair, these images can take the viewer deep. I am not a ""horse person"" per se, but the artistry and beauty in this book is so very rich that it surpasses that perspective. Along with the sheer beauty, there is humor and irony, strength and flow, and much more. I am very pleased with this book and hope to own a large size print from Tony's portfolio someday."
5,"Made a very nice gift, delivered by pack pony, to friends.","A quality calendar, and lovely gift for horse friends. The photos are gorgeous and it is like hanging artwork on the wall."
5,Breathtaking,"All I can say is Spirit Horse's is just Breathtaking. A beautiful book,I would recommed it for any horse lover."
5,Nice gloves,"As with other Mechanix gloves I've owned, these fit well according to size, and are comfortable and durable. Would buy again."
4,Losts of fun?,"My 4 year old loves this he is soo into Deigo that he got his brother fighting over it. It has a button on the drum that is Diego talking, makes elephant noises and drum beats and the head moves. I didn't think much of it but for a fan like my son I guess it was worth it."
1,Contains old information about the book market.,"A great idea that doesn't come off well. This market changes so rapidly, a book would have to be put out monthly in order to keep up with it. The short story market is practically closed to any except famous writers, and magazines like Woman's World which use a lot of mysteries have such esoteric needs, no one can figure out what they are. Study the market by using Amazon and you'll learn a lot more on your own."
3,Napoleon in Gray,"Overall Williams has written a decent biography of one of the South's most colorful Generals. He does a good job with life after the Civil War and a good job describing Beauragards role at Shiloh and Charleston.Unfortunately Williams really just skimmed through Beauragards life before the Civil War. The reader gets almost nothing concerning Beauragard at West Point, Mexico, and in the 1850's. At Mexico no real detail is given to any of the battles Beauragard participated in. We get some basics about him at Vera Cruz, Cerro Gordo, and Mexico City but Williams just doesn't go into detail enough.I thought he could have done better with the conflict with Davis but overall he hit the most important points. I liked how Williams made clear that Beauragard wasn't a bad general, but neither was he a great general either. I think Williams did good at keeping relatively unbiased concerning Napoleaon in Gray.Overall it is worth the read but it could have been better."
4,ready for a change?,"I must admit I miss Jerry Garcia as much as the next fan but this band is approaching the musical threshold one so heavy dominated by the Dead in their Phil and Donna days. This CD is so new age that most, if not all of todays 3 chord ""rockers"", would be hard pressed to produce a cover live. The rhytums laid down in here will hook you from the start and wait you will with excited anticipation for the strangly hip and often jagged guitar riff wandering around but not lost. Call it fate, but plan on hearing of good things happening to this band. They can ROCK!"
1,Corny Pastiche,"Tortoise's music used to be a lush and convoluted affair, and their rampant borrowing of motifs from aged soundtracks and lounge jazz were made all the more palatable by the way in which these were integrated with contemporary electronica and good ol' fashioned rock attitude. But ""Standards"" is beyond the pale - devoid of any real creative direction, it is a shameless jumble of hackneyed instrumental references. Way too clever and media-literate for it's own good, it offers too many references and no musical message of any real substance - the sound of post-modernism gone horribly wrong.The musical content of this album scores two stars, but it loses another due to the overprocessed and unsubtle production - ""Standards"" sounds hopelessly overcompressed and totally lacking in natural dynamics."
2,Prog rock instrumental noodling,"The CD starts out reasonably well, with sort of a generic anthem-rock instrumental number that could have come from an old Joe Satriani album. But then it takes a serious turn into lightweight doodle-noodling that quickly becomes downright annoying. When I first bought the CD I was listening to in the car, and I actually turned the volume down in embarassment that someone in a neighboring vehicle would hear it. Overall, this sounds a lot like the 70s rock band Kansas, only without the fiddle or the vocals, with a dash of Manheim Steamroller (""Fresh Aire"") and maybe some Jethro Tull. Bad bad bad."
4,TNT is a hard act to follow,"In terms of music, Standards is great. In terms of Tortoise, it is only pretty good. Most of the tracks are good, but the first couple of minutes of some songs is just build up for a cool ending. The bonus track Blackbird is a funky electronic-track, but Blue Station doesn't really go anywhere. I recommend this to any Tortoise fans, but if you're new to Tortoise, check out TNT or the self-titled album first."
4,"but of course, tortoise","Well, the godfathers of post-rock return with a 10 song disk. The rock-jazz, eastern, instrumental, ""I don't quite know what genre this is"" sound has returned. This disk is less synthesized and symphonic when compared to TNT, their last release. This album is more rocking and ""in your face""--kind of like their self-titled debut album. At first I liked it, but it sounded like all the bands that Tortoise had influenced, and it did not blow me away. The more I listen though, I realize that this is ahead of most of the imitators. It will please the jazz nerds, the post-rock nerds, and most likely, you. Yet another great Tortoise release. Listen many times and be rewarded. btw, Tortoise was the backing band for Brazilian composer Tom Ze during the last year..."
3,Practical idealism in the 1960's,"Sincerity and hypocrisy, good works and ambition, vie for people's attention in this 1960's comedy. Were all suburban places of worship really only concerned about bake-offs and musicals, building funds and keeping up with the Joneses (or Goldbergs, as the case may be)? Young Rabbi Abel is sure it isn't so, and doesn't plan on giving up, even after embarrassingly superficial interviews, constant pressures from board and members, and low attendance at services. His adventures seem like heavy-handed satire, but it gets more interesting as various characters turn out not to be all bad. Everyone has their hopes for spirituality and social action. For some a clergyman is an encouragement, for others anathema. In the end, some people do get some good things done. And yes, it's a funny book, so if you remember the 1960's, Heaven Help Us is a way to look back and laugh, but also learn."
4,excellent beginning,"animation at it finest? the first four episodes offered in this dvd are a nice beginning. the fortune telling witch seems to possess positive and negative attributes. the 19 year old boy is as annoying as anything, somewhat reminiscent of the fool in the deck of tarrot cards. his efforts to pay off his debt lead him to complete the mysterious stories of the other visitors. the plot is superb and reminds each of us on our journeys the value of acceptance of our minor burdens and acceptance of spiritual guidance. overall, an excellent video!"
2,slight,"i had no idea what to expect when i began playing this, but i was hoping for that unexpected find. admittedly i haven't watched much manga, but right off the bat i recognized several manga standbys -- the spiritual (ghostly) world, over-the-top eccentric side characters (two adolescent girls who repeat things in unison, annoyingly), and the too-cute (also annoying) bouncy stuffed-animal-like object -- and quickly my hopes for something totally cool and new sank, and sank further as the episodes plodded on. nothing about this felt original or inspired. all the characters were stock. the artwork, however, was nice. and the wish giver yuko was sexy. but mostly i felt disappointed and impatient watching this. but again, that may be because i'm not by any means a manga afficionado."
4,For the Most Part I Liked it,"Watanuki sees spirits. They follow him around, make his life miserable. One day they get to be too much, he starts running and he finds himself distraught in front of a red gate and he is mysteriously drawn into the house behind.This is the home of Yuko, the dimension witch, who can help Watanuki with his spirit problem, for a fee. If he works for her, apparently he's a pretty good chef, she'll make those spirits give him a break. He doesn't want the job, but alas, he doesn't want the spirits either. So thus you have the basis for this series, the first four episodes are on this collection.If you're a fan of Clamp you'll like the animation. If you're new to this style, it might take a bit of getting used to, but I think you'll find you're drawn into the story and Watanuki's adventures fairly quickly. I did find Watanuki's screaming a bit much at times, but other than that this is a very enjoyable anime and I'll be checking out the rest of the series."
3,Mysterious,"What young man wouldn't want to serve Yuko? Beautiful, insightful, seems helpful. Watanuki enters service to Yuko hoping she will free him of creepy spirits - although perhaps it would be enough it she freed him from his own annoying habits. Still, as the authentic fortune-teller points out, he has not been without resources for getting by.Four curious episodes and I don't know where they are leading. The pace is slow but the mysteries seemed deep enough to compel watching until the end (i.e. of the fourth episode, completing this first collection). Watching and listening to Yuko was a treat in itself. Perhaps more could have been done with her and irritating Watanuki could have been done without? Just a thought.The songs, one at the beginning and one at the end (both included among the extras) are enjoyable: the lyrics sound quasi-Buddhist.There is something to be learned here but until that becomes clear, enjoy watching, when Watanuki isn't acting out it's either pleasant or intriguing."
3,"Good, but not epic","The Arms & Equipment guide is a very useful book, no doubt, as all its cyberware, extensive clothing lists, and valuable equipment is invariably a must for any alternity player. however, when it comes to the weaponry section...there's much to be left out, for instance where's that arc pistol when you really need it, and just really how hard is it to come across some of these items. without a good head on their shoulders, a gm could easily lead a monty haul with this one."
3,Nice but not essential,"Written in the style of a sales brochure, this supplement provides lots of useful gear for Alternity players. The weapons section doesn't feature many new guns though, most already listed in the basic rulebooks (Players Handbook or Gamemasters Guide). Also included are stats for personal gear, clothing, utility equipment, computers, and vehicles. Well illustrated throughout and features some original ideas. A nice, though not essential addition to the rulebooks for busy GMs too lazy to dream up their own high tech gear."
5,"Sabot Rifles and Mass Cannons, who could ask for more?","this book is awesome! its filled with cool weapons, armor, and specialty material for clothes like Antiscan and Stealth cloth. an awesome suplimentary for only 12 bucks!"
1,Underwhelmed by Underworld. Mental masturbation. Wasted time,Underwhelmed by Underworld. Mental masturbation. An overly-long conceit of 800 pages of insufferable prose that wasted my time. I stopped at page 300.
3,More promise than bite.,"Any American will fall for the first chapter of this book. The scene of the Polo Grounds, the mix of dead icons and working stiffs, everything is brilliant. And then the idea of tracking down the ball is intriguing. But for me it never all came together. Some story lines never led anywhere and others were just beat to death. The book is either 300 pages too long or 200 pages too short."
1,"long, boring, uninspired, dull, in a word, garbage","I read this book because someone compared it with Ulysses and cited it as one of the most important books of the 20th Century. The resemblance to Ulysses stops at the number of pages. Both books are over 800 pages but it ends there. Persevering through Ulysses and the unique style of Joyce takes a lot of effort and the reader is rewarded in the end with greatest affirmation ever written ... Yes. Yes. On the contrary, De Lillo's opus seems to descend down into back alleys, garbage dumps and landfills. I suppose one could write a doctoral dissertation on the garbage metaphor in Underworld. The smart reader is advised to forget about metaphors and just leave it at garbage period. I haven't read anything else by this author and was quite disappointed that he failed to live up to the hype. Might a suggest a career writing copy or commercial jingles instead?"
3,Not bad...not great,"I know books like these are supposed to be lauded for their experimental narratives, but I do like a good plot, and I couldn't really find one here.The nuclear war subplot seemed forced, like DeLillo was trying to make drama out of something mundane. His countless digressions confused me (even if they were courageous), and his ""God's eye"" viewpoint was exhaustively descriptive, so much that it made me feel claustrophobic, which I believe is the opposite of what the 3rd-person omniscient is supposed to do.My husband is a huge DeLillo fan (he insists ""White Noise"" is the best), and he did warn me not to read ""Underworld"" first. It might be a question of style, but DeLillo's writing isn't a style I enjoy."
3,"Some Great Bits, But Too Much Chaff...","Any book that attempts to encapsulate the Cold War, post-WWII, American experience is destined to be a long, long read. The problem is that it's just tough to keep up good writing for 800+ pages, and while certain vignettes were really interesting and absorbing, others weren't. The prologue--a set piece at the famous 1951 ""shot heard round the world"" Giants-Dodgers playoff game--is sheer genius, working in a young black truant, J. Edgar Hoover, Sinatra, Gleason, and news of the Soviet Union's first atomic bomb test. Overall though, there were just too many balls in the air, and it was a bit abstract at times for me."
5,An Uncontestable Classic,"This is easily one of the most remarkable novels in all of modern American letters. Granted, it dwells in that rarified and charicteristically self-selecting family of novels such as ""Gravity's Rainbow,"" ""Under the Volcano,"" ""Moby Dick,"" The Sound an the Fury"" or, even, ""Absalom, Absalom,""etc., etc.The thing about this book that gets me-and it shares this with all of the above- is how it resonates in the soul, man! This book- lumbering, frustrating, maddening thing that it is- ultimately folds you into it; you, as the reader hauling all his or her own correspondences and shared history-become complicit in all the smallness and grandeur of the later 20th century DeLillo evokes. And, ultimately, this book changes the way you think, the way you see things, and the manner in which you participate in your own culture."
1,Not worth the effort of wading through the 800-plus pages,"When I first picked up DeLillo's monster, I thought it was great. One of those books that you can't seem to put down. Then, after I read about 300 or so pages, it became harder and harder to pick it up, until finally I put it down permanently after close to 500 pages. I experienced a great sense of loss at the fact that I had wasted a lot of precious time that I could have devoted to one of the classics. If you like repetition, though, you will enjoy this book. DeLillo tends to repeat certain passages over and over, which in a sense is why the book seems so long and drawn out. Close to 500 pages into it and I couldn't possibly see how or when he was going to end my misery, so I did by turning it back in to the library."
2,much ado about nothing,"I can't believe i wasted hours of my time on this ""masterpiece"". Dellilo strives at every oportunity to conjure the most complicated dribble of words imaginable. His imagery is way too verbose and he is obviously trying too hard. The storyline is the most disjointed one i have every known. It seems to be building up to some over-arching climax but fails miserably in its execution. As other reviewers have pointed out, there is no ""main"" character that emerges. The story required an enduring, likeable character to help us through the mess. It is obvious that Dellilo is a brilliant exponent of the English language. However, with Underworld he has intentionally sought to write a masterpiece. It doesn't have the raw elements required to emerge as a classic. At best, mediocre"
3,I can't decide.,"I slogged through this endless mosaic over the course of about 50 lunch breaks. As with some of Delillo's other books, I had no idea what's going on. Every time I felt like I knew what was going on, plot-wise, those characters/that storyline, went away. Never did I find fusion among the various stories or characters.But. It's Delillo, and there is something so transporting and lovely about some of his sentences. Absolutely definitely not all of his sentences. But some of them make me stop reading, read the sentence again, and almost start crying. He has beautiful words.After I finished this book, and had to have a mental IV for about a month, I started missing it. I couldn't remember what I thought it was about, but it emits some kind of literary pheromone that attracts me."
1,Underworld,this is one of the most ponderous books I have ever read. It lacks a clear focus and drags you from chapter to chapter like a dental pick!! It was poor.
2,My Dinner with Andre,"If you liked the movie, ""My Dinner with Andre"" you may like this book since it too goes on and on. Like greyhound 9, I just couldn't make it all the way through. I am on page 222, and have considered giving up since page 30. I keep hoping the characters will be more interesting - but it hasn't happened yet. Both the writing and the characters are flat."
1,"Long, overdrawn","Might have been a decent read if it had been edited. From time to time the story line would get interesting and I would try to stick out the book to the end. Unfortunately, the few pages that flowed were followed by another 75 or so pages that didn't. Boring, confusing, and by page 400 just not worth finishing."
3,"Many moments of brillance, but a slog in the end...",good thing I was on a three-week vacation or else I would have put it dow
2,"Savor the prologue, trash the rest","On a flight to Libya back in 96, my friend Steve handed me a copy of Harper's. Read this, he said, it's about the best you'll ever read. It was, of course, DeLillo's glorious story ""Pafko at the Wall"". Later, here it is as the prologue to some of the most verbose, long-winded, meandering drivel of recent years (apart from Salman Rushdie, natch). Does DeLillo even have an editor these days ? Anyway, if you can't get a back issue from Harper's, here's my tip: Borrow the book, photocopy the prologue and treasure it again and again at your leisure."
2,I gave up,"I tried, really _tried_ to plow through Underworld's 800+ pages. I just couldn't do it. Too much like work. I can appreciate what DeLillo was trying to do to sum up post-WWII America, and using the travels of one of the most famous baseballs in sports history is certainly a clever way to do it, but I simply never felt engaged in this work. The characters seemed flat and uninteresting...and I got really fed up with nearly every character speaking like Jackie Mason. ""What? You want I should finish this book? You should know from books!"" I suspect that if you are about 50, and you grew up in Brooklyn, you'll enjoy this more than I did."
4,An important novel for the end of the millenium,"This is an important novel. It is not a cheerful one,it's realistic and scary, yet profoundly revealing of our society and values.It's a summary of who we have become, of our culture, or at the very least a well-educated view of the last half of this century.There's a lot of images here, a movie in words, the places and people come alive under the author's pen. Amongst all the descriptions and dialogues, you will find little sentences that are worth re-reading often.I was especially touched by the epilogue, a brilliant overview of Us,now.One thing did annoy me at one point, the jumping in time parts were sometimes dizzying.Still, it was a book where I learned, felt conflicting emotions and that willl stay within for a long time."
2,Detritus in the Bronx,"Remember the vacant lot in the Bronx where everything and anything might be found? I present that image as the missing theme of this text -- a dumping ground of old items and events designed to pluck momentary, however pithy, recollections and memories from the reader which are then immediately thrown back onto the pile because in the end it's still junk."
4,Read Ulysses first.,"I picked up Underworld because I was struggling through James Joyce's Ulysses and I needed something less perplexing. Had it not been for that juxtaposition, I would have abandoned Underworld. But, reading Joyce liberated my reading style and I was able to just enjoy the ride DeLillo took me on. Much of it felt like I was eavesdropping. I didn't always know who, what, when, and where, but it certainly was fascinating. This book is not about the last page, it's about all the pages. Relax and enjoy."
4,Often genius,"This large volume by Don Delillo is a great book, placing Cold War American life under the microscope. Though events often seem choppy or meaningless to the story, this book reaches, at times, the high expectations that its author aims for. The prologue, as long as it is, remains the best and most powerful section of this book. I could easily see it being extracted for large college anthologies for 20th Century Literature. This wasn't the best book to come out of 1997; John Banville's The Untouchable was. However it's one of the best, along side Philip Roth's American Pastoral and Thomas Pynchon's Mason & Dixon."
2,Not so hot-runs the gamut of interesting to extremely boring,"When I read the original review I was interested because the book begins with the famous Thompson Home Run Game. As a lifetime Giants fan, I was intrigued and anxiously awaited the book's arrival. However, reading the book was a chore. The initial chapter with a young boy frantically scrambling for the home run ball led me to believe that I was in for a treat and would be through the 800+ pages in no time; I was wrong. No treat, and the book took forever (I'm not adverse to lengthy stories, I love Michener). There are a few sharp spikes in the story that captivate, but between those are long, ponderous passages where you just wonder what is going on and why--I found myself saying ""get on with it."" I finished it, but I was left wanting . . . wanting more fleshed-out spikes of interest and wanting less about characters that seemed like space fillers. I don't know why the editors love this book."
3,beautiful writer poor storyteller,"I hate to be judgmental, but this guy can write well. He just seems to forget about plot and character. Its hard to get through a book like that. I was able to read White Noise, The Body Artist, and Cosmolopois, but they were much shorter. I started this book, put it down around page three hundred, then read six other books. I picked it up again since it was supposed to be modern America's best master's best work (sorry David Foster Wallace, RIP). I just can't do it. I was able to read it, but it was hard, like reading a book of beautiful essays, but none that had any connection other than the author's voice."
4,"i have to agree with the consensus, it's really not for ever","-which is not a bad thing. some people enjoy its framework, others don't. nothing more. a book that really requires your attention most importantly your thoughts inbetween the times you're actually reading it. otherwise you'll immerse yourself into a lost world of american history's not so newsbreaking yet highly interesting (fictional) events. yet even with so much information packed into the book it manages itself to wrap itself around one central theme in the end - peace."
2,"Provacative stream of consciousness, but difficult to follow","As a first-time reader of DeLillo, I was seduced by the wondrous first chapter in Underworld. All of the praise for this book you will come across is well deserved when directed at this sweeping prologue.From this pinnacle, the book quickly turns downward. Or rather outward - in a smattering of images and moods. These broad-stroked moments are alluring to the reader, and in some cases are enough to sustain one through many difficult passages. But the more I read, the more I was hoping for some piece of the story I could hang onto a little more tightly.Sneak a quick read of the first chapter, slide the book back onto the shelf, and walk away."
2,What?,"A dense, impenetrable and ultimately dull, directionless novel. Perhaps I don't ""get"" it because I don't live in America, never have, and never will, but this whole bloated affront to forests just rubs me the wrong way. It takes fifty pages for some kid to get to a damn baseball game, and it's downhill from there."
1,A tome by any other name...,"I received this great, heavy book from someone who mistook me for jaded or goofy enough to enjoy it, apparently. Something is amiss with language if DeLillo's work is critiqued as genius. My guess is that 'genius' is French for 'Annoying, Yet Still Boring'. I read thru this pile as a perverse exercise, perhaps atoning for sins in my past lives. It was with great pleasure that, as voluminous as it was, I transformed it into a jolly good door stop. The novelty wore off, alas, and I dropped it in my library's return bin as if it belonged there. For this, I apologize."
3,100 Words or Less,"Déjà vu! That's my reaction to Underworld, and unfortunately it's not good.About 100 pages into the novel the slow burning realization finally hits home: I've read this before.Maybe a dozen years ago, I read this novel and do not remember any characters, plot, image, scene, or dialogue. Only when rereading certain sections did I begin to admit ""Oh yeah, this sounds vaguely naggingly familiar."" Nothing specific. Simply a general feeling I've been bored by all this before.What a sad commentary on a book to remember nothing about it. Or is that a reflection on me?"
4,Re: Book cover photo of Underworld,"Did anyone mention that the cover photograph on this book is an eerie portent of a world-changing event that happens a few years after DeLillo published his novel?Look closely at the clouds-high skyscraper presumably in New York City with a crucifix on a church in the foreground. Note what-looks-like a bird flying towards the top floors of the skyscraper.Does this remind you what went down in NYC on September 11, 2011?"
5,Masterful !,Quite simply Mr. Delillo has cut ot a niche in the literay world with this book alone. His use of metaphor and epigramatic paragraphs is a testament to his magisterial talent. Some search for history and plot and character development in this magnum opus ...well these tone deaf readers will come away disappointed for Delillo writes English prose in a magnificent poetic style which surely isn't for all ....only those who love ....truly love language for languages sake will find this book to be as beautiful as i did ..there are aspects of this work that stand on their own as essays and even short stories. If one is searching for a linear history of the cold war or a social history of the last 5 decades of the last century don't read this book ...but if one wants to grasp the poetry of this era and its language from Lenny Bruce to J.Edgar Hoover buy it read it and tell a friend.Future generations will be taught this book in colleges for many years to come i predict.
4,sometimes things you don't fully understand are still fun.,"This book is loved by many and reviled by others. But I am struck by how many of the negative reviewers feel compelled to criticize the length (or weight) of the book. Yes, it's a lengthy read. That much we can tell from simply looking at it or lifting it! If that fact alone causes the prospective reader such distress they'd do themselves well to make another selection. I suspect that those who do actually read the damn thing will find much to enjoy and contemplate. Yes, in fact I did read the entire book, and I recommend it without reservation. Although it is true that I could not explain it to you. I confess that going back to it after a few days often left me at a loss to recall earlier characters and connect all the dots. But never did I fail to marvel at the beauty of the writing and , now several months later, I still roll some scenes over and enjoy. Seems to me that reviews should be submitted by those who have actually read the book."
2,Annoying.,"I feel compelled to finish Underworld, since I slapped down the $27.50. I find it one of the most unbearable books I've ever read. Wait for the paperback edition (or get yourself a wagon, like I did) because you're going to be lugging this loser around a long time."
3,Underwhelmed by Underworld; pretentious; mental masturbation,"No way for 800 words of self-indulgence and overwrought prose to keep even the enlightened reader on task. I did last 300 pages. The writing is,of course, good--but give me a break."
1,The king's new clothes,"A classic example of the sort of book that 'everyone' raves about because they don't want to appear uncool by not doing so. Ignore all the hype and the mad stampede to heap praise upon this - it is, quite simply, tedious and unreadable. The style is turgid and the prose pretentious. It lacks structure and development, and is populated by characters notable only for their forgettableness. Believe me, you have better things to do with your time than waste it on this. Don't let me detain you any longer - we have better books to read."
2,Unreadable,"Largely about garbage and waste, this huge book (deceptively seductive in its jacket copy and ardent reviews) is essentially a waste of money. If you are a lover of fiction in search of a good story line, avoid UNDERWORLD. Delillo's prose reads like an experiment for a creative writing class. Although I enjoyed the first chapter, I soon found the story not a story at all but a ramble from topic to topic. Delillo sprints without warning from character to character, and time frame to time frame. In a word, I found UNDERWORLD to be: ""unreadable""."
1,Underworld puts you to sleep,"The book's style is rambling and hard to follow. You don't get the sense that there's a story. Reminds me of Pynchon's style which I find ambiguous, elliptical prose."
2,Says more about its fans than America,"A good writer has written a deeply irritating and pretentious book. It has brilliant spells but at other times it is so pompous it's embarrassing. ""Cosmologists of waste""...what does it mean? To love this book, you have to lack confidence in your own taste and understanding, the kind of person who goes to exhibitions (by the likes of Klara Sax?) because you think it's good for you, and because you are afraid your friends might get there before you. Go back to Saul Bellow for brainy thrills."
2,I just don't get it!,"The first 80-odd pages were intriguing. But the further I read, the more disappointed I became. The book has some stunning imagary and keenly observed set pieces, but there seems to be little substance beneath. To me it was like going down a hill on a go-cart with four flat tyres - you expect it to hit pace at the next turn, only for it to continue to limp along and eventually grind to an embarrasing halt."
5,You can talk forever.,"Don Delillo's Underworld is one of the greatest efforts from any living writer to answer the most basic questions of all time, what is man. His charachters, his dialogue, his sense of time, sense of place, his weltanschaung, all join forces to make Underworld nothing less than a masterpiece."
2,Boring beyond belief,"What an incredible waste of supreme talent! Don Dellilo writes with imagery and poise second to none. I took pause often to marvel over his writing skills. However, the only reason that I finished Underworld was several plane trips with no other reading material available. The reader begs for this marvelous author to actually tell a story or teach us something about the human heart. I am not sure what we get instead. It reads more like an an author's notes from Creative Writing 101 than a novel. It's one thing to get angry about a book, often a mark of great art (e.g. Phillip Roth). It's an entirely different thing to get bored. Underworld rates a generous 3 only because of fantastic prose, but I would not actually recommend it to a friend."
3,Some fantastic writing well hidden under verbal trash heap,"Even though I was often apathetic and had the feeling of slogging through a jungle with a dull machete--I have to admit there were passages of pure poetry that left me pleased and even excited. Nothing, though, in the entire book comes close to matching the breathless delight of that prologue. That alone was worth having to try and struggle through the rest of the novel. I give it a six rather than a two or three because the guy's obviously a fantastic writer who needs to buy a few red pencils and spare the rest of us his writer's self-indulgence. I think there's probably a fine book in there somewhere--or even two or three..."
2,"Too Dark, Too Pretentious, Too Too","Underworld has the distinction of being the first book I have put down (in many senses of the phrase) since The Adventures of Augie March in the eighth grade (sorry, Saul Bellow). The setting is dark and not really evocative of its period or its place. The gimmick of having the characters live backwards through the narrative is just that. The female characters are poorly drawn, and the male characters carry around so much angst that they sink below ground. I am both a Cold War kid and a hazardous waste professional, and Delillo needs a get a life more pertinent to mine. All in all, you can indeed fool all of the reviewers at least one time."
3,"Magnificent beginning, then peters out","The first section is a tour-de-force and it propelled me forward with great delight and expection. But from there the barely-existent narrative just sort of ambles along, almost aimlessly. De Lillo's prose is terrific, and almost owrth the read in itself. But, if youre like me, you also wish for a story that has some momentum to it. Post-modern in every sense of the term, both good and bad."
3,This book is not easy to read but worth the effort,I enjoyed this book. Not what you would call an easy read and a knowledge of the terminology of American baseball would have been handy. Love his writing style and the myriad of characters. I don't think it was profound in any way just a fascinating read about an interesting selection of people. It lived up to expectation after hearing the author inteviewed on the BBC. It was as intelligent and interesting as he was.
3,"It isn't ""Godfather""",I think I am guilty of mistaking it and reading it expecting something like Godfather by Mario Puzo. Was I disappointed? You Bet!First the good news. The command on english the author has is commendable. It just flows.But the bad news... There is barely a plot. You have to keep track of so many characters and the time periods do not have a chronological order that you feel exasperated and willing to give up. I think more than the usual average would have given up reading this after starting.If what you expect is a good literary treat and not a great plot and story this is for you. Otherwise it is a strict no-no.
5,Underworld Cuts Deep Into your Soul,"This book covers many subjects with a very detailed point of view. Delillo can fit a lifetime's worth of feeling and emotion into one paragraph and there's about 800 pages of it for those who can handle the pain of introspection. I think people have problems with it because it forces you to look at your own life and all the relationships and decisions that have led you to the point where you are now. 'Underworld' is about memories: the good ones, the bad ones, the forgotten ones and the ones that seem insignificant til you remember them 10 years later. Not for the faint of heart."
5,The Writer as Virtuoso,"DeLillo is to writers as Pavorotti is to tenors: a virtuoso, a show-stopping athlete. UNDERWORLD is about connections, the supporting web beneath appearances, a verbal (and nounal, adjectival,adverbial, gerundial) paean to the esoteric mystical perception that all things are one.It is simultaneously ribald, blasphemous and reverent, spiritual in all the deepest and truest senses. This writing is simply astonishing, stupefyingly grand and good. It reveals our species-specific (special?) ability to anthropomorphize and invest even inanimate objects into the web. Everyone from housewives to terrorists can (and, I suspect, DID) find inspiration here.In a sheerly technical sense, this writing is so good, it has a whiff of brimstone about it...like what they used to say about Paganini's fiddling. As long as UNDERWORLD is, it's over far too soon."
3,Almost there,"Underworld is almost a masterpiece. It is a very good piece of writing, but it lacks in character. It is a work which is almost like the nightmare of the Bruegel painting , and it is a very visual book, from garbage to mushroom clouds to artworks based upon garbage. An interesting book to study if one bothers to let the mind roam the scenes. However, there are, for me, glitches, especially with the way the central female character, Klara Sax, is drawn."
3,"Reluctantly, I give this three-stars","Excellent writing, of course, and fascinating material, characterization, etc. but I just gave out after about 600 pages. I just felt I was wandering around and around in a cornfield; like watching an Andy Warhol movie. I couldn't get a handle on any plot; couldn't see where it was going. Afraid of plodding through to the end only to find that there was no there there."
2,Why Bother?,"DeLillo grabbed us with White Noise, and has dropped us ever since. This book, although poetic at times, and although is represents ""the way people actually talk"" is tedious, chaotic and difficult to stay with. If ""reality"" or ""historicity"" are the benchmarks of a good book, you'd have a better time sitting in the lobby of the Smithsonian and trying to eavesdrop on every person who walked by. I gave up on the cusp of part 5. Why bother?"
3,Shallow,"Delillo is a talented wordsmith. But he has nothing to say. For the ""underworld"" of America, he remains comfortably in the realm of baseball and lenny bruce. So many scenes try very hard for depth -- but not from an honest feel of the world. Rather, they proceed as though airy structuralist constructs will produce truth out of theory. This is a book written for critics, meant to be understood to death. Which, I think, is very different from previous Delillo works. But it fails. Because whey you cut back and forth between subway graffiti and elite ""artist"" hobnobbing in the way Delillo does -- which is to say, without anything that we don't already expect -- whatever point about ""above/below"" that he tries to make becomes downright trite."
2,who cares,"I read this book, because it was recommended by a friend. After reading the opening story about the ""Shot Heard Round the World"", I was prepared for an amazing book. But to my disappointment, it turned out to be boring and convoluted. I get was this book is about--a deconstructive look at the American psyche during the cold war period. It is a loosely tied together set of stories--glimpses into people's lives really--linked by the number 13, a baseball, nuclear war and garbage. But who cares? For all of the author's witty prose and random occurences, the book does not do what it should--tell a story. The author could have made the book 400 pages or so and done the same thing. Instead, he gets too caught up in his deconstructionist experiment. Don't read it unless you have a lot of patience and time on your hands."
1,Ick.,"A semi-pretentious friend of mine recommended this book to me. I should have seen it coming.Tried to read it, got through about three hundred pages, and still mourn the time I wasted trying (as well as the tree that gave its life for the printing)...This is book is boring in an ""epic"" sense of the word. And I don't just that ""it didn't entertain me"". I mean that it's a monument of sterile self-indulgence, vacant pretention, and pathological wordiness. Somehow I can't help but see it as a symbol of the excesses of our times: 800 pages about nothing, and people praise it.You might like it, but don't say you weren't warned."
2,A Disappointing Offering from a Good Writer,"""Underworld"" is the type of novel that frustrates me. This is because DeLillo is a good writer and the ideas about which he writes are great, yet somehow he manages to create a mediocre work of fiction. I think that he tried to make his canvass too large and as a consequence DeLillo has created a novel that has little cohesiveness. The disparate characters and settings are united under the umbrella of the Cold War, but these sketches of prose and ideas never gel into a novel nor into a true story. I understand that DeLillo writes in a ""post-modern"" genre, more or less, yet a novel full of seemingly disconnected events still needs to have threads of story connecting them, however tiny these threads may be. As a series of vignettes or a colletion of shortstories it may have worked, but as a novel, it is too long and just doesn't work."
2,A poor adaptation to Kindle,"I haven't finished the book yet so I won't comment on the story itself. I will say though that this is the poorest adaptation to Kindle that I own. I'm 80% through and there have been typos and formatting errors throughout, averaging about one every couple pages. Line breaks that would mark a change in scene or time seem to have been omitted and quotation marks are sometimes missing, making the dialogue hard to read. I understand this is a postmodern work but I don't think these were intended by the author. ;)"
2,Delillo's exhausted themes,"I was disappointed in this work. Like Whitenoise and Endzone(not to mention his other novels), Dellilo is still writing about the same problems of our American culture, that is, we are too much of a ""consumer culture"", everything is a ""simulacrum"", and we live in an age of crisis or apocalypse. Dellilo needs to move on and write about something else; Postmodernism is dead, if it ever really existed, and perhaps Dellilo could write something less formulaic and something with a little more heart."
3,"Half-way There, But Still Going Strong ...","I hope it doesn't seem too absurd to review a book I've only half-read, but my feelings for this novel are so mixed, I needed to know the views of those who had got to the end.It appears that people either love or hate this book, (although everyone seems to like the opening chapter.) I can't say it's the best American novel I've ever read - but I have certainly never read anything like it. Like its characters, it yearns - to be whole, to be liked, to succeed and so far I think it is on the right track.If it ever finds a plot, I'll get to the end a little quicker, but if it doesn't, I think I'm happy to follow wherever it takes me.Curious."
2,Tuckers out in the end,"This book starts out brillantly with an amazing first chapter about a single baseball game. The quickly changing scenes (ballgame to J.Edgar Hoover in stands to announcer to kid in the stands) captured the spirit of America of the time. Then the next few chapters show some promise that the characters will be intriguing and watching them develop will be fun.Alas, by the time I was 300 pages through the book I was already tiring of it. Not wanting to give up after having committed the hours to read the first 300 pages, I trudged to the end. What a tiresome/disappointing end it was. The last chapter was simply silly. I felt Delillo was trying too hard to make a profound point of which he just wasn't capable.Would I recommend this book to friend? Maybe, especially if (s)he likes baseball (I love the game). Will I read another Delillo novel? Probably- though it will have to be short (White Noise?)."
2,Hanging on for dear life,"I'm only about 200 pages into this octopus, and its eight arms (read: subplots) are slowly and painfully entangling me. I want to survive until the end but I will freely admit - it's tough. This is not exactly a page-turner, but it's so adventurous and promising that I'd like to finish it. I wanted to get other readers' opinions for some possible encouragement. This is my first go with DeLillo. Is this typical of his style? So far, this book does not fill me with desire to read his earlier stuff."
3,not as good as I thought,"I expected alot more from Delillo after reading the many great reviews of his latest book. But I find myself disappointed at this long, fragmented prose. The story lacks any coherent flow, it is merely a good paragraph here and there but that doesn't make it a great book."
2,"Pretentious, written for effect, not readers","DeLillo has created a tour de force. Unfortunately, it is a legend in his own mind. Artfully presented, the prose is heavy and dense, the characters are built up at a glacial pace and the plot is still relatively remote after 300 pages. This, combined with the incessant time-hopping chapters, made for a most unpleasant experience."
2,What the hell is this all about?,"The first 60 pages are spectacular! Then it goes downhill from there. I could not finish this book. I stopped at page 181 and couldn't go on. I have read a few other reviews here and agree with those who did not like it. It is bascially a bunch of unconnected stories that do not have any sense of purpose or narrative for that matter. I couldn't care less about the characters and cared even less about what they were talking about. A condom factory?! Why was that put in there? Can anyone explain this to me? I returned the book back to the bookstore and picked up ""Lloyd What Happened"" by Stanley Bing and a baseball book by Yogi Berra. If I want to know what REALLY happened to baseball in the '50's I'll listen to Yogi."
1,Disappointing,"After a wonderful start, this book became an amazingly boriing exercise about half way through. I would not argue Dellilo's brilliance as a writer, however, some deeper sense of humanity seems to be missing in his characters. Also, there is a pretentious arrogance that comes across in his writing. He tries too hard to show off his ability to be a brillian descriptive writer. If he would of done a better job of getting us inside the heads of his characters instead of just describing them in a ""I can see through everyone, aren't I brilliant,"" sort of way, this book may have worked. Why did this book get so much hype?"
2,ex - cruci - ating,"Delillo is a keen and insightful observer; this populates his book with brilliant phrases, sweet cadences. He also happens to be in love with his style; this has removed any sense of balance or proportion from this tome.Here we have an author who flogs a good idea to death and then one more. In his world, if drinking tea is pleasant, it would be even more so to grind on the leaves.I read someone comparing him to Pynchon. Ha! This book is a smudge compared to the brush-stroke of ""Gravity's rainbow"".Not recommended."
1,Unreadable,"I can't tell you how many times I've picked up this book and become bored and confused. This book is unreadable and uninteresting. It's the kind of book that, once you put it down, you can't pick it up. Don't bother. This book ranks in unreadability with Mason & Dixon."
1,When will it end?!,"I'm 200 pages shy of completing this novel, a feat that has spanned over MONTHS. To put it simply - and without boring anyone with ten dollar words - this book is not worth the time. Classics like Moby Dick and Ulysses are read in schools across the country. I doubt this book will ever reach such high standards, and expectedly so. I'm lost, confused, I've had enough of the baseball pity. What do all the other people have to do with the story? If they're all intertwined, then someone explain to me HOW! I'm forcing myself to finish this novel, only because I'm hoping that at the very least, the last or penultimate line will reveal the secrets and explanations behind all the dead air."
1,As a former fan of DeLillo's,"I was very disappointed in this effort. The opening bit about Bobby Thompson's homerun bored me to absolute tears. It was cliche-driven, to say the least. Nothing new there. I waded through hundreds of pages before I found anything to really hold my interest, and by that time I'd determined that it just wasn't worth it. Now I have to go back and read Libra and White Noise to make sure I wasn't dreaming when I read those books and thought they were great."
5,Breathtaking!,"Reading this book is like listening to brilliant and accomplished jazz musicians trading fours, playing about America."
5,"creamy, dreamy and drugged","Once again, Don DeLillo has outdone himself, this time both in length and sheer reading pleasure. Sure, the common complaints are the fact that this is quite a hefty novel with little interconnection between the plot or myriad characters, but we don't read DeLillo simply for the story. His writing is masterful, self-assured, and simply wonderful, making the reader feel ""creamy, dreamy and drugged,"" paralleling Edgar J. Hoover's sensations when first trying on his leather mask. If the length bothers you, it is quite feasible to read other books in between, as this book, written in sections, can be easily read in the same way. Although not as directly forceful as White Noise, there are truly beautiful moments in this book that will really make you glad that you read (and finished) it."
2,very long and boring,"I bought the hype and got the hardback. At best this is a used paperback read. I kept waiting for it to get entertaining. It did in parts, but not nearly enough to make it an enjoyable read, This was one of the most painful reads I've went through. I finished, which is better than quitting, but it took a long time to do it. I read several other books in between."
3,This heavyweight tome is a big bore.,Forget it. Don DeLillo should have thrown this unfinished manuscript in the garbage. Klara Sax is the dullest character in literature. Reread WHITE NOISE instead. What a disappointment.
3,Read Infinite Jest instead.,"I held off commenting until I actually finished the book, but how could I know it'd take me five months, on again off again, to finish it? I liked the first 3rd or 4th of the book all right, but then it fell into this unending cycle of basically trivial accounts of unconnected (and worse, uninteresting) peoples' lives. Who cares about Klara anyway, or Sister Edgar, or etc? The book never gives us enough of these characters to get involved. Manx Martin was kind of intriguing, but he's the exception that proves the rule, if you ask me. And the one cool idea was nuking garbage. Ultimately disappointing. My advice is to read Underworld, by all means, but then (if you haven't done so already) go read DF Wallace's infinitely superior ""Infinite Jest"" and have a real good time. Infinite Jest covers a lot of the same territory (tv, nuclear dread, drugs, etc), but much more intelligently (and entertainingly) and with characters you actually care about."
2,I might have to read it again to say anything intelligent about this book.,"I made it all the way through, which was an accomplishment. It is beautifully written, but about all I can tell you about it is that it is about a baseball. And a lot of other stuff. I really liked White Noise and Libra, but this book is a lot more obscure."
1,"Tried to read this, twice, and failed both times...","so many words, so little dialog, so few characters to really know and like (this requires dialog)...just didn't get it...bored me to death..."
2,WHY? WHY? WHY?,"I have read a great number of novels in my short 24 years, but none thusfar have left me scratching my head more than underworld. The only consolation that I have is the fact that I only paid 7.99 for this book new at B&N.I agree with the reader who stated that the first 50 pages or so were delicious, however the rest of the book to me was almost completely undigestable.This is perhaps the only book by DeLillo that I will subject myself to. These are only my opinions, but I feel that over 800 pages are a far-sight too many to go through only to be let down.I STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT BUYING THIS BOOK. IF YOU MUST CHECK IT OUT, GO TO THE LIBRARY, AND SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED DOLLARS!"
5,Exquisitely photographed,"It's hard to overstate the beauty of the photography in this book. Peter Lee demonstrates remarkable skill in giving each image the respect it deserves. Potters, pottery fans, and photographers alike will delight in the richness of ""Warren MacKenzie: An American Potter."""
5,No Brainer,This is an easy-to-use device that works almost as soon as the broadband connection is screwed in. It has a great range and the wireless/modem combo saves space while conveniently merging two abilities into one. I'm surprised there are not more gateways on the market.
2,Pricy and not worth it,i thought this would have more than one ethernet plug but it only has one.I thought this would be have a bigger area coverage but it doesn't.I don't have wifi connection outside the room the modem is in...and I don't really have a big house. I tried changing the settings but they don't really work.I feel like I wasted 100$.Definitely will not buy again or recommend to friends.
2,"Great for web browsing, Poor for online gaming.","Great: easy setup, combined with modem and wireless router, no need to purchase any additional equipments for you to surf the web. Has 1 Ethernet connection and 1 usb.Poor: not good for gaming. Port forwarding or triggering isn't working well with gaming. Decent speed, but you will get disconnected from an on-going game frequently."
3,"Fine modem, poor wireless...","It works fine as a modem, but the built in WLAN is too slow. If I knew I it would be faster to port through my old Linksys WRT54G I could have saved myself half the price and just bought the modem only version."
4,"Works well, good range, easy to configure","I implemented this in my daughter's apartment that she shares with four other girls.Comcast is the cable vendor.This went very well, I configured a unique SSID, set up security, all the girls laptops came up fine.Comcast had a wizard that came up on first use that actually configured the broadband connection.Range has not been an issue so far."
4,works Fine.,Had a couple of problems with it. It was New in the box. After the weekend I've had to restart it to reboot. Other than that works fine.
5,"Easy to set up, works perfectly","the instructions that were included were great, I had no problem setting up my secure wireless network, and now all 4 computers can connect to the internet and each other effortlessly"
1,Never get this product# disappointed,When I got this product I was super excited to save money from cable companies. Unfortunately the seller did not add the installation disc nor the manual so my modem is practically useless right now. I tried looking for an installation download but to no avail yet I found the manual which was even still pointless without the software.I tried to pay the cable people to set the internet with the modem but they found it to be defective anyways so there is pretty much no point in getting it. No one should ever get it because its a waste of money and time that I cannot get back.
1,Unhappy,Product did not work. Returned product at my expense and have not received a refund. I sent an email but have not received a response.
1,Homade copy of software,Definitely not what I bargained for. It came with a homeade copy of the software for it. Have not been able to get it to work and don't know if it's a hardware problem or software. I have just decided not to purchase items of this nature through Amazon anymore. Do not recommend!!!!!!!
1,Worked ... for a while. Seller a nightmare,"This unit was purchased on Amazon and supplied by a reseller.The modem was pretty easy to set up, worked for a while, then kept resetting itself. I returned the unit. Three weeks later I'm still trying to get my refund from Amazon's supplier."
3,Would be great but,This unit would be a great combination modem/wireless router except that I cannot set any of the security features. I have spent more than 3 hours on the phone with Motorola technicians and have tried two units. Both have this problem and the technicians do not how to correct it.
1,Never buy a motorola surfboad,I get constantly disconnected when using this sufboard. I have trouble connecting to the internet even using my computer just a few steps away from thr modem. I ended up buying a Linksys router.
1,Less Than I Expected,"In order to have my Vonage phone service work with this modem, I had to turn the built-in firewall off. This took quite some time to figure out. The broadcast signal strength could be stronger. Also, the broadcast signal interferes with my home security TV system. Motorola's Tech Support offers little assistance and does not respond quickly enough. The full documentation is on the CD. A hard copy would have been very helpful."
2,Motorola SG90 Cable Modem with switch,This modem is a decent product which lacks instructions to set up a wireless network. I find that customer support needs improvement. The jury is out on this one.
5,No hassle wireless,"I replaced the TimeWarner supplied modem with this (only hassle was with TimeWarner--they wanted their modem returned before they would change the id to the new wireless. They still charge you for theirs anyway.)The result is much better than the Linksys I have elsewhere. Plus, unlike Linksys, there have been no problems in several months of use. It has a wider range (through block walls vs. Linksys which couldn't make it through wallboard)."
1,Wireless Modem,"We purchased this item with the intention of using it to replace the modem from Comcast that we were paying a monthly usage for. After reading the instructions for installation, we called Comcast and were told this modem wasn't working. We notified Amazon, and they notified the seller, who emailed us requesting info, because the modem was new. Well, it was new to us, but it was out of warranty from Motorola, whom we contacted. It was manufactured in 2007/2008 and ran out of warranty in 2010. We notified the seller, and they stated that they really weren't a modem supplier, that it was the last one they had and it had been laying around for a while. An email from the seller offering to refund our purchase price and letting us keep the modem (which was useless to us) was received and we accepted that result."
2,Worked great...for a while and then cost me more,"Picked up the SBG900 in January and it worked great until a couple of weeks ago when it would not hook up with the internet. Tried the old reboot that they seem to need every once in a while and that fixed it. Cool. Except that it happens 3-4 times a day now. I then jumped through the hoops with the Motorola techs and it was determined after a week that I was due a replacement. (don't use the e-mail approach, call them) But I have to pay shipping to get it and again pay shipping to return the defective one. So much for the great warranty. Amazon stands behind anything I have bought here, no fees for replacement of defective products. Go figure. No more Motorola in my future, too many other companies out there who would want my money."
4,Thank goodness for kids,"I purchased the surfboard to replace a dying gateway. Once it's installed, it works well, but I'm greatful for my son, who after 3 attempts got it up and running. I'm also greatful he's learned to walk away from things that are frustrating him for a while and come back to them later!"
2,easy and reliable,"I've had this over a week. All my setup issues were cause by my ISP. This set up easy, and provides solid signal.Update:After months of using this. I hate it. The signal is good for about 25 feet, the device needs to be reset every week and is in general cranky."
5,Good solid modem,Reliable modem and wireless router in one nice package.I have not lost a connection yet.
1,router and NAT must be disabled to work with Vonage,"The Motorola SBG900 is notorious for its incompatibility with Vonage, the Voice-over-Internet-protocol (VOIP) telephony provider. Vonage devices simply do not work reliably with this device if the router and network-address-translation firewall are enabled. Mine came from the internet service provider (ISP) so I had no choice in the matter -- it was the cable modem the ISP insisted on issuing -- so I had to negotiate with the ISP to cripple the firewall and router functions. Once that was done, it began to function as a simple cable modem and allowed me to connect my own router, which supports Vonage. Thus, if you are interested in using Vonage or a similar VOIP service, avoid the Motorola SBG900."
1,THE WORST MODEM I HAVE EVER OWNED,"The title says it all. Every 5-10 min i have to reset the modem, even with a direct connection. The signal constantly goes out. If i could give it a zero star rating, i would. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MODEM. You will be very sorry you did."
3,motorola surfboard sbg900,"pretty easy to setup without proper installation software except for networking,found same modem on different web site for a whole lot less money"
1,worse ever.,"I've never seen a worse modem ever, if it's not gonna works from even a couple of meters far away why should I use this product..! it's not a big house at all, there is not any wall or something between modem and computers, it stays near of my room but there is not any efficient solution at all either, but if you check the price of this modem you're gonna see that it pretends it's a quality product. The matter of fact is it's not. My third floor neighbour uses apple product modem and I can use that connection from first floor and absolutely better than mine which stays near of my door. It's more expensive but it definitely worths.."
4,Very good customer service,We received one that didn't work very well. But we gave it high rate because the customer service was very good.
3,no support for product,I was trying to use one modem/router. that is why I bought it. till now I have not found installation cd or easy to read instructions. using as regular modem still connected with a second router
5,Motorola SURFboard,The item was in great condition and arrived very quickly. The item did not come in its original packing but still included all the essentials. The router was easy to setup and overall works very well a!
5,Perfect so far!!,"I am using the modem and wireless router with a PS3, laptop and printer. I have had no problems so far. I'm saving money by not having to rent the cable company's modem and I get the wireless router to boot. I can gain access to the network from anywhere in the house and my PS3 has no lag time. Overall, I am glad that I purchased this item."
1,Does not keep the connection,After only one week of use the modem started to drop the connection every few hours(not only the connection to my wireless devices but even the one to my wired computer). I bought this based on the good reviews but I made a mistake as I should have bought a router from a reputable brand. Motorola should stick with wired cable modem not wireless.
3,Very Good Product.. Very Bad Technical Support!!,Have a good range and a good security system..I had a small problem when I first recieved it.. it was software-related.. I called the technical support. They were not really helpful.. They suggested to return it to Amazon.com .. I hate that.. I tried to press the very small reset button behind the modem. Every thing went ok.. and it worked as best as new..
1,30$ to protect your wifi with this unit,"Amazon has nothing to do with this issue. We got our package as promised and in good condition. I paid the NEW price, but when I ran the software for start up, it wouldn't remember the security settings. I contacted Motorola and they said the product was NOT new. The warrenty had expired last febuary, it is now 8 months past that date. They informed me that they could not help me until we showed them we purchased the item NEW. Once we did that, Motorola customer service could help us add password protection to our WiFi for 30 dollars. This particular unit's software DOES NOT come with it for free. Even though it is one of the more expensive units out there. I know I can monoter who is using my internet and even protect my computer, but when has companies charged for this? I'm with others, get two different units and call it day. Add 30 dollars to the cost of this unit, because that's how much it would really cost to get the same features as something else."
1,No use to me,"It worked perfectly as long as my laptop was the only computer being used wireless, but when another computer joined in hard wired, I kept getting bumped off the connection. There was also only one outlet for a direct connection - most annoying if you have more than one computer that you want to connect without using wireless. It was no use at all to me and I returned it."
2,its ok,Most of it works just fine. Yeah its nice to have a modem and wireless gateway all in one but it doesn't always work with my setup.I have a voip phone. It is the only thing plugged into the modem. Everything else is wireless. Whenever the phone rings all wireless connections are dropped. I would assume this to be the case with any wired connection that causes a jump in bandwidth use. This is extremely obnoxious! I'll probably send it back and go back to my old modem and router setup.
3,Not what I had hoped for,"The photos, illustrations, and layout are beautiful, and at first flip through I found several pieces that I wanted to make, but when I began working on them I found the directions to be incredibly vague. This is not a good book for a beginner to learn from. I am generally very good at learning new skills from books, but the information just isn't there. I found I had to refer to other publications to figure out techniques and then guess at how to make the pieces shown here."
3,DISAPPOINTED,"I recieved the book yesterday. Alot of the designs and projects are relatively simple to make. I find that the same designs are repeated throughout the book. As with lariats, chokers, and simple strung neclaces. The instructions are vague, and many times are left up to the student to figure out. There are diagrams, but no threadpath to find out where to start or end. In many cases there is NO threadpath at all. There are better designs and instructions in bead magazines.I don't recommend this book, I am only an advanced beginner and bored with it, and disappointed!"
4,A Pretty Good Book,"This book has both it's high and low points. I've enjoyed looking at the different necklace designs and the 'basic skills' section has been very helpful. However, I've found that some of the instructions are vague or otherwise less than helpful. If you have an intuitive sense of what you're doing (or are willing to experiment) that's fine, but otherwise things can get a little confusing."
2,"Quantity, not quality","The book is definatly a case of quantity, not quality. The book had nice pictures, but the directions were impossible to follow. They are incredibly vague, and the author doesnt even tell you what part of the necklace you nare making. The author would of been a lot better off only putting half of the projects in the book, and writing more detailed, step by step instructions. Even if I could follow the instructions, I probably wouldnt of made any of the projects anyway. They are all very old fashioned and just not wearable. The colour scemes on some of the necklaces, such as the dichroic triangle are awfull. I suppose this book would be more sutable for the older, more experienced beader"
2,Senior Citizen Style,"I too believe that the instructions are vague but the pictures are nice. One star for effort and one for the pictures. I also think that all the designs are for old ladies. Yuck, wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Well, unless I didn't like them."
1,SAD AUTHORS HURRY SO MUCH!,"With just a little bit more time and making the publisher PAY ATTENTION, books like this would be MUCH better. The vague directions that lead no where, are a real disappointment.I do not need to write a huge story on how badly this book was put together. BE SMART! go to the library or Book Store and look before you order here. Cheaper prices do not make a bad book better."
2,Cool looking but finicky to use,"This caddy was everything I needed to organize our ""more-than-basic"" sewing supplies. It very neatly holds and contains lots of little spools, needles, buttons, and bits of other things, however it is difficult to open and close. This is due to a pretty cheap plastic construction and rough edges that bind moving parts.You definitely get what you pay for with this unit, but I would save up for a slightly nicer one if I had it to do over."
4,pretty good movie,i have the dvd of sissy pike and i liked it. its about a crazy los angeles girl named sissy who moves away. she makes a friend. its pretty good.
3,Should be a double tell not a triple.,"This is a misleading name in that the sound tell doesn't work. If I hold this up to my ear with other signals silenced, it sounds like an excited cricket but isn't heard from more than a few inches. The flashing light probably has some special situation applications. The vibration seems to be the most 'vibrant' signal and can be heard if you are close to it and it is sitting on a hard surface. If you have it in your pocket or clipped to a shirt pocket, it is easily felt although the depth makes it feel bulky. If you plan to carry this in a purse, you are likely to miss signals but since I don't, this is speculative. If you are in another room when it signals, you probably won't hear it. The operation is simple and easy to comprehend. Generally, this has more pluses than minuses. If you prefer a strong sound signal, this isn't for you."
4,Great timer for meditation,"This timer works wonderfully for our meditation group and several individuals have purchased it for their own use at home. The flashing feature doesn't seem to be available on other timers. It would be nice if it also had a clock feature, but it works very well as a timer. It is handy for kitchen use at home, especially if you want to go into another room and take the timer with you."
3,Shake awake,This is Not what we expected. I thought I was ordering the Sharper Image product. Got something much cheaper and chincier. Disappointed.
4,Simple Yet Gorgeous,"I had never even heard of Olmi before getting this film, which is odd since I've been exposed to many other italian postwar directors. Therefore, I FIDANZATI (The Fiances, or The Engaged) came as a complete surprise to me. The storyline, sometimes slow and wonderfully hypnotic in places, centers around the life of a construction worker who takes a job in Sicily and moves away from his fiance in northern Italy. It's the classic romantic ""abscence makes the heart grow fonder"" storyline that is usually trite and banal. But somehow, amazingly, Olmi manages to pull it off, mainly through the great performances of the two leads and the brilliant editing towards the film's conclusion, where they read letters and thoughts to one another in a way that distorts past, present, and future. Highly recommended, as is Criterion's new editon of Olmi's IL POSTO."
1,Cheap plastic,"The instructions say that you can bend the plastic piece to fit inside the tank, well, it broke when I tried bending it. The company won't respond to emails either."
2,Weak,"Pretty lazy documentary. There are many interviews with nobodies with little or no connection to the band. Many facts are all wrong. (ie: ""VU was formed in 1964 by Reed & Cale and then quickly recruited Morrison & Tucker"" ""Nico was Hungarian"") May be a good introduction for a newbie. But serious fans can skip over this."
3,VU: Under Review Under Review,"I bought this CD thinking it might be a complete rip-off.I thought maybe there was no VU music on it at all. I was wrong.It is quite good.It has some good early Velvet footage(with Cale singing Venus In Furs in the background) and interviews with actual members( Mo Tucker ,Doug Yule) of the group.It was nice to hear from them instead of hearing Lou spin his usual B.S.It is not the definitive documentary and doesn't claim to be.If you are a true Velvets fan I think you will enjoy it."
4,(Victorialand - Liz) x Eno = Imperial,"The music here reminds me vaguely of Cocteau Twins' Victorialand, only much slower and without the forward momentum that vocals would provide. I am also reminded of Brian Eno's atmospheric Apollo album. As suggested by the title of track 7--Music for Labour--this CD is good to listen to while at work."
2,For Beginners Only,"This book consists of one page overviews and explanations of various types of home visiting programs. It would be interesting reading for early childhood education or social work students, but does not contain the depth needed for the professional home visitor. This is a Zero to Three publication and does not meet the high quality standards I have come to expect from their materials. This book is expensive and simplistic for what it claims to be."
5,I love Richard Lugo!!,"I recently attened the O-Town concert in Philadelphia, PA and Richard Lugo was the opening act!!! He is a really good artist and a great dancer. I am defintely going to buy the full cd tomorrow. Not only is he a great singer and dancer, but he is so hot!!! I am like a number 1 fan of *NSYNC and O-Town and I am gonna become and number 1 fan of Richard. He was really nice and cool to the fans. I wasted a lot of film on him. I guess being the same age as him is cool. Usually all the guys in music that I like are 4-9 years older than me. For once there is a guy who is my age and he is so hot!!! Maybe even Richard is reading this now. I just wish I could know a little about him and maybe even meet him. I think that would be the best!!! I hope you enjoyed my comment and I strongly suggest that you go out and buy the cd tomorrow. I am sure the music will be as great as the pictures are inside the cd. lol"
2,What a jerk!!,"I have read a few of Diana Palmer's books and have liked them. This one however was not worth the pages it was printed on. J.B. is an awful man. He was not your typical alpha male, he was cruel and emotionally abusive. I couldn't find an ounce of sympathy for him and I found myself angry that Tellie didn't feel that she deserved better than him. Like I said, I like Diana Palmers books but this one isn't worth the read."
2,Disappointed,"This is my first Diana Palmer book, and will be my last. The story was very predictable, and bad boy and sweet girl get together. I didn't like the moral character of J. B., one mean individual, and after a couple of days of Tellie getting her memory back, things change. Sorry, maybe I'm a realist, but a leopard doesn't change his spots over night. Anyway, sorry...I was hoping for a much better read."
1,Disappointment,"As a major Diana Palmer fan, I looked forward to this new book (instead of a reprint) but I was so disappointed! This book is the worst of all the other books (abused as a child, orphan, cruel man, no interest- then an engagement, etc.) strung together into one book- I actually said ""yuck"" when I finished it. I agree with the reviewer who said that they have ""outgrown"" Diana. I have kept some of my favorite Diana Palmer books and do reread them. This is not one that I will keep."
