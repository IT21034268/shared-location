1,Worst Music Device,"I bought this pathitic box for quite some money, only to find out within hours that the software took about 30 min. to install on a Pentium 4 with 4 gigs of ram. Not only did the software installation go badly, the actual transfer of songs was long and unreliable. It takes about half an hour to transfter to cd JUST ONTO THE HARD DRIVE. You must transer it using the software due to it uses some weird formatte. Then burning the songs took another ten minutes. When you did get them on, youll find that after an hour, the song data gets mixed with each other, and the tracks start 10 seconds into the previous song. Out of all the music devices ive used, this is by far the worst one ever. I do not reconment buying this excuse."
5,Very Sensual,"This is a story of a young and alluring beauty, the only daughter of a rich merchant, who offered herself as the price to a well-known criminal lawyer Patrick Hamilton , in return for his defence of her father in a murder case. You encounter here the different human sins-- greed for money, lusts for political power, social eminence and carnal gratification..etc.. Anita Mills writes a story so full of passion that some of the love scenes sizzle . But they are so beautifully sensual and erotic that one enjoys them instead of finding them resentful."
1,Junk,Add me to that list of people who bought this highly rated timing light based on reviews only to go to use it for the third time and find that it had no display..........dead. Buying from local bricks and mortar stores and paying a little more is starting to look better and better.
4,Equus 3568 Review,"This product is great. It is mildly priced and well built. I have timed my '95 GMC truck, my dad's MGB, and '68 Volvo with it. The readout is crisp and easy to read, simple yet lots of features, and good quality wires and clamps.If you are a DIY'er and love cars and trucks like my father and I do then this is an essential tool to have in the garage."
3,Equus digital advance timing light,"Like the adjustable up/down buttons for the advance, maybe a litle slow (one speed) and the tach is a great feature!I am disappointed in the brightness of the strobe. Almost impossible to use outdoors."
1,Equus 3568 timing light,"The product is great when it works,I bought two and both have stopped working with in approx. 1 year."
3,good basic light with one major flaw,"The major flaw I found is that the user is unable to specify the number of cylinders for the engine tested. The light is set for a four cylinder engine, which is fine if you are using it to set the timing on a four cylinder engine, but if you have more or less the light is reduced a basic nonadjustable light. Otherwise the light is fine."
1,Bad product!!,"I bought two equus 3568, and sell one for a client, inform not display inductive advance, later on one month of use!!I am an argentina customer, and lost my money on this purchase..."
3,I'll Try Anything Twice,"I've had one of these things for a couple of years and in that time I've used it probably a half-dozen times. I just went to use it again and it died. The idea is so solid that I'm going to buy another one to see what happens - but for $80-90, which is what they sell for, I suppose you can't expect much. Others in our club have these and swear by them - so perhaps I just got a bad one. We shall see.-Jon Thompson"
5,Great,"Works great. I like the shape as it lets me get into tight spots. Easy to use. It's from China, so it should be less expensive, but it is still a good product."
1,It doesn't work...,I used this lamp four times in my car and it didn't work no more. A complete waste of money for a new equipment. I'm very disapointed about the quality of the product. I'll try to fix it by my own because almost 100$ is a bit expensive for my pocket. I won't buy another one from this people.
5,A great addition to your Bridge Game!,"I bought this book after I got Contract Bridge for Beginners... This book should be on the shelf of any bridge player! It's not the best book for beginners, but it could be used by a beginner as well as an advanced player. If you are a beginner, you should buy Goren's Contract Bridge for Beginners. It's short and to the point. Bridge Complete expands on many of the items in the beginner's book and offers many new items."
3,putnam hitch,"the putnam hitch arrived very quickly in the mail. the box was destroyed and came in two pieces (box and hitch). luckily the bolt bag was zip tied to the hitch itself, so all hardware and instructions were there. it took a skilled mechanic to install because the attachment plates were welded slightly too close together, about 4mm, so i had to bend/pry out the plates to open the gap. also the carriage bolt would not fit into the sliver of the access hole so i had to grind the head very narrowly to fit into the slot. the instructions were not in ""chinglish"" (nice).other than that the hitch looks very clean and shiny with a good quality coating. this install job took about 2 hrs and a lot of sweat."
1,IT'S PORN!,This item was sent to my 12 year old nephew. Several pornographic images! Do not get for children. This should have been stated in the description.
3,Ductigami - Too short to know,"I liked the book. But, it felt rushed and not enough stuff. I expected it to have more projects. A kit would have been nice with a couple of rolls of tape."
4,Good Book,I purchased this book for my father - the Mr. Fixit who has everything. He loved it. The directions and illustrations are fairly easy to follow and there are some cool things to make. Here's a tip: give a roll of duct tape with the book!
2,Interesting but with some inappropriate content,"I ordered this on behalf of my daughter for a Christmas gift for one of her older brothers. I didn't take time to read all of the reviews and we received the same unpleasant surprise of some toilet humor and a few suggestive or nude images in the 2006 edition. p26 - apron on Eve in a famous painting of the Garden of Eden (wish I knew the original artist -- left this one untouched since the duct tape apron covers Eve); p50 - tool belt on a nude female angel sculpture (I duct taped over this one) & p76 - older yet suggestive female shower curtain picture (again, duct taped over). The projects look interesting, so it's my hope that it will still be enjoyed at Christmas with a roll or two of duct tape."
2,Returned this item,"I purchased this as a gift for my 12 year old grandson. After I looked at the book, I saw it was patterns and ideas for larger items, not the small origami items he had been making on his own. My grandson had, without instruction, already exceeded the knowledge contained in the book."
1,"Needs to come with an ""adults only"" warning","I purchased this book for my 10yo girl for Christmas. I'll admit....I didn't look through it first. It never occurred to me that it would have adult themes/pictures/jokes in it. What a disappointment! My poor girl was offended by the pictures (thankfully she saw only 2 of them before she handed it to me to ""fix."") I thought that I could tape over the pictures (or tape a couple together)....so I did. Imagine my surprise to find that the book also contained inappropriate (for children) jokes.As for the usefulness of the book....does anyone REALLY want to make a shower curtain out of duct tape? Or a cooler/lunch box? Seriously? I purchased the book with the hopes that my child could make wallets, hair bows, covered pens, even aprons. But let's be real. The cost of the duct tape to make one of these larger projects would be more than purchasing the item readymade at the store."
5,Duct Tape Crazy,This book was purchased for my 12 year old grandson who LOVES to make items from duct tape. He has an amazing collection of duct tape; but we had not been able to find a good book on simple projects. This is the one is selected and both my grandson and I are very happy. He will continue to make and remake these projects throughout the year.
5,speedy delivery,I was very happy with the speediness of receiving my order! It came much faster than any catalog order I placed! Thank you!!!
2,Buy the older edition,"The older edition (not available, looks like, though abebooks may have it) is the way to go. Exactly the same projects, without the un-funny ""man show"" misogyny and toilet humor. I would give that edition 5 stars, if Amazon had it. I bought this one because I needed my own copy, but I think I'm going after the old one. This one really is a turn-off - makes me not want to have anything to do with it, to be honest. I'm glad my library had the old edition and I read that one first."
2,Totally Improper!! Total Shame & wast of time/$,"I purchased this book as a slightly serious gag gift for our Pastor who loves Duct Tape & WD-40 & believes that it can fix anything :o) I thought it would be great to put into his Christmas bag, boy was I WRONG!!! I couldn't believe the pictures in this. So glad I looked through this before I wrapped it up, never thought I'd find what I found in it. Yeah I get it art is art but you don't have to put Naked & 1/2 naked people/statues & in the pictures holding or modeling something with Duct Tape I mean come on. It's porn with Duct Tape people!! It just totally ruined the book & my whole plan cause I know it would've made a great gift. It wasn't just 1 page either I counted at least 5 pages or more that needed to go & you can't rip them out because on the opposite side is the final directions for the prior projects. Some of the art work was cute, like the dogs w/ the Duct Tape rain coats but the other pictures ruined it so I'm returning this."
4,The pictures are stickers,Yes the pictures are stickers and they may wear after use for while. The batteries get put in the base and is secured with a screwed on cover. The sounds are quite long too not short and realistic as well. There is a buffered edge of wood around each picture which should help the sticker not to be too worn over time. Certainly a good educational tool to discover the sounds of animals on the farm with a visual too.
2,Poor audio quality ruins great concept,"What a great concept ole ""melissa"" and ""doug"" came up with. Blocks with different farm animals that only make the sound of the animal when matched up correctly. Unfortunately, they should have spent a little more in the audio department. All the sound is garbly and distorted. Even better, the rooster sounds like he's being butchered, the horse sounds distressed, as if being chased by a pack of wild hounds.I would have been willing to pay a couple of bucks more for a better product."
2,Disappointing,"This toy is good in theory. However, it's quite disappointing when you try to use it. The blocks have to be in the holder just right to get the sounds to work. Then, when you do get them in the right place with a match, you can't really hear the sounds. My kids didn't play with this toy much at all. I recently threw it in the trash - that's how disappointing I found the toy to be. I would not recommend it."
5,Learning from this toy in so many ways,"I bought this toy for my niece when she was about 16 months old. She loved it. The pictures, the sounds. Three months later, she's grown with the blocks. Before, she lacked the dexterity to orient them in three dimensions so make the animals match up. Now, she can handle three dimensional movement, no problem, and her challenge is to get the front and back to match up in the right directions. She knows what animals they are , knows how to make the sound of all of them (woof woof!), and when a pig or a cow shows up in another book, that she can go over, get the blocks and arrange them to make the sound. She. Loves. Them. Melissa and doug - two thumbs way up."
3,Cute idea but not fun for more than a couple minutes,"My daughter loves animal puzzles so I thought this would be a cute different toy. The idea is good, and I'm not sorry that I bought the toy but: it's a little harder for my daughter than I thought. She is a pro at actual puzzles but this was hard for her. She had a hard time putting the two halves together in the right direction. The other thing is that they aren't painted as other melissa and doug puzzles are, they are just tacky stickers that can peel right off."
3,Remember to get batteries,"Got these for my grandsons for our Christmas eve dinner, and thought as most toys do today they would not need batteries, but they do. So before you plan to use this toy you will need a screwdriver and batteries installed. Also being made by Melissa & Doug, I didn't expect to have to do more to this toy then to watch the boys enjoy it!"
3,Not up to the usual Melissa & Doug quality,"We love Melissa & Doug toys, but this one falls far short of the usual quality. Sounds are garbled and often no sound is produced even when a match is made. Our kids quickly discarded this toy.Instead of this toy, try the LeapFrog Fridge Farm Magnetic Animal Set, it is only a few dollars more and the kids love it!"
3,Could be a little better,"Supervision required. Right out of the package my little one focused in on the little round contact things on the blocks and started trying to pull them off. And well, she managed to remove part of one so you really have to push hard now to get the dog to bark. Also the sounds are ok, but could be much better/clearer. She has a hard time understanding that the blocks have to be turned the right direction and may match the animals but not right ways but that will come with time. Playing with this lasts only through one round of all the animals, then interest is lost for the day. At least she does play with it and laughs at the sounds."
3,Great if you have one small child...not so great if you have more than one small child.,"While the blocks themselves are great, if you have more than one small child it can get a little dangerous. I have 2.5 year old twins and when one is trying to put the blocks together the other slammed the other block down catching her finger in the cradle. Lots of tears.The sounds are cute and my kids like it lots. Only one kid at a time though!"
1,Christmas present that only worked for 1/2 hour - disappointed!,"This was so disappointing, I brought this as a Christmas present for my little girl. On opening it was a hit with matching the animals and the sound of the blocks. However after 2 turns of making the animal, the sound started to fade and after a few more tries, no sounds came out at all. I tried other batteries in case, however nothing has made these blocks work again.Disappointed in the product, I brought Melissa and Doug as I thought this was a good product, will think again before buying any of their toys."
5,A great performance by the greatest singer,"The CD is great. Michael's vocals are as strong and passionate as ever. The CD also includes a lot of Michael's witty and interesting auto-biographical anecdotes (Including one on how he got to be Phantom). So, what's not to love: Great tidbits about the first and best Phantom ever to light the stage and his great voice yours to enjoy over and over again."
5,Absolutely enchanting,Michael Crawford is one of the finest singers on stage today. And this album of his live concert is filled with beautiful music and electricity. I would highly recommend this.
4,Terrific!,"Listening to Mr.Crawford is like being stroked by a velvet glove! His voice isn't for everyone, but it hits me where I live. Sure, some songs wouldn't be on my song list for this venue, but this is just one of several CDs/DVDs that I listen to frequently. A must for any Crawford fan who wants to hear his work beyond Phantom of the Opera. He's such a born showman, watch Barnum and see if you don't agree."
5,The companion to the DVD / VHS of the same thing!!!,"Great companion if it could be called that to the""Michael C in Concert"" VHS, DVD....I have the DVD of this, as well as the CD reviewed on thispage.......!!!!Iv'e never seen Mike in the flesh untill I watched thison PBS-- loved his dialogue with Gene Kelley--hilarious-""Took a bath, then another shave. This time I'm Bleeding""-as quoted from Mike!!!!This CD is always a great follow up the concert, butit's up to you!!!One thing-- ""Papa, Can You Hear Me"" WAS NOT on the DVD/ VHSconcert-- 4 1/2 stars for the DVD review...."
5,You will Not be disappointed,"I have been a HUGE Michael Crawford fan from the time I saw him perform Live years back at the Macy's Parade. His voice is AMAZING and I became a fan instantly. I have never seen Mr.Crawford perform live other than on Television that day at the parade,but this Cd is the next best thing to seeing him in concert. There are personal stories that he shares,my favorite being how he was so star struck and nervous when he met Gene Kelly,who if you are a fan of Mr.Crawford's or even Ms.Barbra Striesand,know he directed them both as well as the late GREAT Mr. Walter Matheau in ""Hello Dolly"". This is one of my favorites and I love Mr.Crawford's speaking voice as well as his great singing voice! A must for any Michael Crawford fan"
3,pretty good!,The book in my opion was pretty good and covers everything but genetics!!! This book is good if your intention is not on understanding the more complex side of how they get certain colors frm breeding bettas with certain genes!
2,Does nothing to dispel a persons misconceptions,"The interviews were a little interesting, the book was well written and structured, however it does not discuss the relationship of prostitution to stripping, pervasive influence of government and/or organized crime nor the long term effects such exploitive use of a strippers beauty may have had on their relationships since. The concept seems to need a little more in-depth exploration. I also felt that the critical, feministic theory is limited to only a few paragraphs and it should have been covered more thoroughly. I don't think this book does much to challenge a persons preconceptions or prejudices."
4,((,"Best make-up ever! The only complaint is that the plastic on the back of the compact breaks before it is gone leaving you with a rubberbanded compact, it liteally falls apart! I have been using for 2+ years, every one of them does that."
5,Extremely pleased with ALL Larenim products!,"I splurged and ordered several Larenim products.(foundation, hocus pocus, eye shadows and dusk til dawn) SO happy I did! I have problem skin, (psoriasis) and have tried MANY products, several department store brands and a 'consultant' line, with mixed success.I love the feel of the Larenim line, my skin doesn't feel cakey or itchy and the look is fantastic. I feel confident again, Thank You Larenim."
3,Short and not so sweet!,Not only was each episode shorter than normal but there were only 8 episodes. It was like ok lets get this over with and move on. Even the ending was too quick and should of had an epilogue. Do Not recommend this season but instead try season 2 or 3 for a good grasp of the show.
4,"Unique, easy-to-read kids adventure","Ever since the Harry Potter series (of which I'm a great fan) exploded in popularity, it has spawned a few of what seem to be knockoffs, none of which come close to being such good quality as ol' HP. So I was a bit suspicious when I picked up this book, especially because many of the characters are British, but was pleasantly surprised to find, as I kept reading, that this book strives to be unique and not mimic JKR's style, story or anything else.At first, too, it seemed like a flimsy plot - nothing but ""Oh, good heavens! Another adventure has befallen us! Pip-pip, cheerio, etc."" I thought it was just going to be ""rinse and repeat""...one pointless adventure after another, but after a bit I got interested in the characters and ended up enjoying this book. It's good adventure for younger readers and with no harmful topics to speak of. Check it out!"
4,Goood Book...,"I actually liked this book better than I expected. So the story startes with inteoducing Larklight, home to a family of normal human beings. Arthur Mumby and his sister Myrtle take care of their father because he has been greatly depressed since their Mothers death. After they receive notice of a certain Mr. Webster is to arrive, their dad begins to feel hppy for company. But when Mr. Webster arrives they are ambushed by an army of spiders who want a precious item in Larklight that can help control the universe. After Art and Myrtle escape without their father, they meet Jack Havck and his crew which they soon accompany in the adventure of their lives.!!"
5,Fun and fast steampunk for young teens,"This book was so much fun! I loved the mix of Victorian sensibilities with space colonization, especially the use of Industrial Revolution-era technology (with a little alchemy thrown in) to create spaceships and stations. I liked the unique qualities attributed to each planet and their inhabitants. The story is a very familiar adventure/fantasy formula, but the setting and characters make the book."
5,A charming and delightful book!,"I honestly think this is one of my new favorite books! Absolutely wonderful! Funny, creative, cute, charming, endearing, fast-paced, and sweet!Delightful characters fill the book from cover to cover. The plot is both intriguing and pretty complex without being too confusing or obvious. The illustrations add to story and seem very fitting to the style of writing.The book is filled with wit and heart. I adored it!"
4,Bordering on great,"Of the sixteen tracks on this CD, ten of them are reallygreat-""Rose Ellen"" being my favorite. A couple more ofthem are really good and the rest aren't bad. If""Sunday Morning Comin' Down"" had been included, I wouldmost certainly give it 5 stars. I have several of theold LP's and I am looking forward to more releases of Nat'smusic on CD. I think he was really an underrated artist.Many thanks to Nat's wife."
5,great lights,I'm very happy with the lights. They work great with a great price. It was worth the purchase.
2,Sends Mixed Messages,"The movie wasn't horrible. The acting was fine. The dancing sends mixed messages.Some characters purport to pursue self-respect. At the same time, they engage in sexually aggressive dancing that borders on erotica at times.Other movies were able to be creative without being sexually suggestive. Unfortunately, it is almost every dance that the males are behind the female dancers in crude and sexually suggestive manners. The only exception seemed to be with all-male crews."
5,Honey 2,Really enjoyed this movie. Kat Graham is great in this movie. Watch this movie I think you enjoy it also.
3,Honey 2,Honey 2 has a good story and more dancing than Honey. I still like the first movie better because I really liked Jessica Alba's style of dancing better.
5,Perfect for my needs.,Just right for drawing up your soccer coaching ideas. I very much like the fact that the opposite side has a half field display too.
5,Great Coaching Aid,This is a must for anyone coaching U12 or above where the kids are really starting to understand positions and movement on the field.
3,does what it should,I bought this for my rec soccer team of 8 year olds...it comes with a black dry/erase pen but nowhere to put it...no velcro or anything so I had ot attach my own velcro to it with a string. Makes it much easier. It has 2 sides..one a full field and the other half a field. As longas you arent bothered by the loosey goosey pen then this is a good value for the money.
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I did not enjoy this book, but I confess that perhaps I simply misunderstood what this book would be about when I purchased it. I was looking for a book about Isis, and instead got a book about a woman who seemed to be suffering an identity crisis - a subject that from my point of view, has been done to death. That I am sure is not the authors fault, but if you are looking for a book about Isis, you will be frustrated by just how little this book really refers to her."
4,We need remastered reissues!!!,"I bought the LP's of ""Sound of Music"" & ""Like This"" in the '80's. Yeah, I had A CD player, but, albums were still less expensive. Remember the record companies promise that CD's would drop to the price of LP's? Mmmm... what happened to that? I'm gettin' a little off track, I guess... so, yeah, I thought those were really good albums & I also remember seeing Holsapple playing guitar for R.E.M. in Madison. Great show! So, ok, what is it that makes ""Sound of Music"" cost $18? Supply and demand? Stop that! I've got a stand alone burner that did a nice job of the analog to digital transfer. But, of course, the inevitable crackles & pops are now digitized in all their glory. Guess I'll just have to live with it until a reissue makes for a more reasonable price. If the price is not prohibitive for you, you really ought to get it!! Great pop hooks!! PEACE!!!"
1,"Poor Quality, Bad Item","I bought this item as a gift for my friend and after just ONE DAY of wear the ""brass"" band in the middle had completely lost its fake coating and revealed the cheap metal underneath. The inside of the ring did the same. If it were actually sterling silver and brass as the company claims, this would not have occurred; rather it was cheaply made of metal with goldtone and silvertone coating.After much hassle and disappointment I was able to return this product for a refund of my money.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS PRODUCT."
1,Not Quality,"Unfortunately, I also had a bad experience with this ring. I bought it for my husband's birthday the end of October and by Thanksgiving it already looked awful. He only wears it on the weekends because he can't wear jewelry at his work. Needless to say, I am now buying another ring."
3,It powers the device but it doesn't work with firewire.,"It's physically compatible with the GV-D800, and it powers the device, but it doesn't work with firewire. The GV-D800 only seems to be detected by the PC when being used in battery mode."
2,Not for KRZR K1 as advertised,"I desperately needed a battery for my KRZR K1. I ordered this only to find when it arrived that it is NOT the battery for a K1 and does not work, but rather is for the CDMA version of the KRZR, the K1m. As Wikpedia puts it: ""A GSM/EDGE model is released by AT&T, Rogers Wireless, T-Mobile, and Cincinnati Bell Wireless under the name MOTOKRZR K1, and a CDMA/EV-DO model was released by Pocket Communications, Verizon Wireless, Sprint PCS, US Cellular, Alltel, Bell Mobility and Telus Mobility under the name MOTOKRZR K1m. The exact features and technical specifications differ somewhat significantly between both models."" You want the SNN5779 Motorola BC50 for the KRZR K1 (GSM)."
3,Decent OEM battery for Motorola KRZR K1,"It perfectly fits to Motorola KRZR K1. It's OEM battery so the battery cover looks different from original one and it has old manufactured date, probably it uses a recycled cover. Comparing to original battery, this OEM has less capacity and is not as flesh as the original one so the usage time is shorter than I have expected. But, it's less than a half price of original one so I would recommend this to someone who don't really need a continuous talking time that the original battery provides."
1,I wish I could rate the item!,I would love to rate this item but that would require for me to have recieved an item in the first place.Accesoryone has gave me nothing but trouble regarding my order & then threathned me by saying if I want a full refund I would have to retract my comment that I posted stating the problems that I was having with them.The bottomline is I will never order anything from this seller anymore!!!
4,Motorola BT50 Battery,"The product is the same OEM battery that came with the Motorola V323i. The battery performs well. With only moderate use, the charge lasts several days. The same battery costs quite a bit more at retail cell phone store or service provider."
1,BT50 battery junk!,"Bought this battery thinking I was getting a good deal. I was wrong. After paying a hefty shipping charge for an item that weighs practicly nothing, I recieve it and it won't hold a charge for more than a half day. Worse than the one I was replacing.Very disappointed!"
3,he has a trait like Brad Pitt,"Oprah once said that Brad doesn't like to talk about his looks. He stays focused on promoting a film or a cause; he never says, ""Look how hot I am!"" Similarly, here Jay Cutler talks about his gym routine. He never once says, ""Look at how hot I am!"" even though surely that's what many viewers are thinking. He spends the first 8 minutes fully clothed, so he does tease you a bit. I'm so used to seeing bodybuilders posing onstage that to see one practicing in a kitchen was unique. Jay has a low, manly voice to match his Herculean body. There is an extras section that is nothing but an imitation of MTV's ""Cribs."" Although his house looks huge, he showcases only about 3 rooms which make it seem like he's in an apartment. This DVD was probably designed for people who want to bodybuild, rather than people who lust after bodybuilders. Still, Mr. Cutler is delicious eye candy and I was entertained watching this despite being more likely to lift a doughnut, rather than a barbell."
3,House of Mirth Much Better,"The first Edith Wharton book I read was House of Mirth, and I was hooked. I read Age of Innocence and continued with this book, The Best Short Stories of Edith Wharton. However, these short stories are not of the same caliber as House of Mirth. They don't engage the reader, and after I finished a story, I couldn't help thinking, ""Was that it?""Read House of Mirth instead; it's a very dark and cynical book."
2,ok,"really enjoyed davids bedroom album, however, not to enthused with this album, Some of the lyrics have that smooth melody but after listening to the whole album, it doesnt quite compete with davids bedroom album"
3,ok,"not a classic such as Triage or bedroom stories,but better than most things you could hear today."
5,Great disc,"If you are fan of his, you will immediately recognize Baerwalds sharp, inciteful lyrics. His songs are widely accessible to all who listen. One of my favorites in a long time!"
4,Do yourself a favor and pick this disc up...,"Well, I assume the review listed here from David himself is legitimate (?), but in any case I still say pick up this disc! If for no other reason, at least you are supporting a talented songwriter who gets little, if any, recognition or airplay from ""the business"".This CD includes a sampling of selections from David's self-published ""A Fine Mess"", presented here in slightly polished up form. I believe ""A Fine Mess"" is now somewhat difficult to find (see http://www.dbinfosource.com for more info) so while I do prefer the grittier, more expansive two discs worth of material on that release, if you can't find it or are looking for a place to start, then by all means go with this disc! To me these songs are personal contemplations on love, hope, loss, faith - they are sometimes sad, sometimes funny, your basic roadmap of life. I'm glad to have them!"
2,In Retrospect I Should Have Left It Alone,"In retrospect, I think I was trying to make a hat out of a pair of shoes, and should have left well enough alone with the material on ""A Fine Mess"". Though I'm as narcissistic as the next guy, I honestly can't really recommend this album. Better to track down a copy of ""A Fine Mess"", if you're interested. Or better yet, ""A Love Supreme"". Just my two cents.David Baerwald"
2,misrepresented,"I have a large dog weighing 80 pounds. I have always chosen the mega tablets. It would have been nice if they would have informed you that they were NOT mega tablets, very sneaky with picture advertised"
3,Quick Read,"My first glimpse of Elizabeth Gunn and Jack Hines and, although I'm not yet addicted, this was a novel I enjoyed as it was a quick read and had very good aspects of it.I found the beginning court room drama slow going but once the verdict was in things started heating up and became interesting. The relationship and struggles of Trudy and Jack remind everyone how things will work out in the end if they are meant to and give the reader hope of a better tomorrow.Gunn's sixth Jake Hines mystery has me curious as how the tale of Jake began as well as how it will end."
5,GREAT SOUND FROM A GREAT CITY,"DISCOTHEQUE IS ONE OF THE BEST CLUBS IN THE WORLD (AUTODENOMINATED ""BEST CLUB IN TOWN"") IN BARCELONA (SPAIN), KNOWN FOR IT'S BALEARIC HOUSE SOUND, TAKEN AFTER IBIZA. EVEN THOUGH TIJUANA CLUB IS NO LONGER AROUND, IN CONJUCTION WITH DISCOTEHQUE, THREW SOME OF THE BEST PARTIES AROUND AND THIS CD CONTAINS SOME OF THE VERY MUSIC THAT MADE THESE CLUBS SO FAMOUS. ELEGANT VOCAL BALEARIC HOUSE WITH INSTRUMENTAL, MIXED BY THEIR RESIDENT DJ AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE, SERGIO PATRICIO."
5,Don't Let the Name fool you!,"This CD is basically a release of great house toons from the night club Terasa in Barcelona, Spain. The name ""Tijuana"" in the title refers to the name of an after hours club, also in Barcelona.(I've been to both and they take their house music seriously) Let me be the first to tell you that this CD is a great find. Both CD's rock with the same type of uplifting Spanish/Disco house vibe that made Ibiza blow up in 1999. Is it a surprise? Barcelona is only a 20 minute flight from the great island."
5,Good fit and Comfortable,Like the title says it was a great match for me. I have washed it a quite a few times and still looks and feels great.
3,"great t-shirt, but sweater is a bit too tight!","you truly get more for your money with this duo pack of a comfortable shirt and sweater. i am 6 foot tall and slim and i thought the ""Large"" sweater would fit me just fine, but the hood is tight around the neck and sleeves are not long enough for comfortness, i recommend the sweater for the junior-high kids. the t-shirt fit me just fine. great logo and cotton."
3,maybe not,"I was going to buy these cake boxes but then I noticed a couple of things:1. Shipping costs (only USPS and that's expensive).2. Seller's attitude (not one I'd like to encounter should there be a problem). Seller's typical response to a problem is something to the effect of ""sorry you didn't see the fine print"" (see the seller feedback tab for Confectionary House)."
1,These boxes are made badly,I have been using boxes for the past 3 years from other makers to ship cookies and cakes. This box is half the weight and does not stand up to handling. It is hard to put togeather and was shipped all bent up so I had to toss out 20 of the boxes and iron the rest flat.This is a shabby product even though the price was good. I should know that you get what you pay for.
5,George Clinton proves that he can still bring on the funk,"George Clinton's new album Dope Dogs is a work of art. The funk scene is not quite what it used to be, and people are expecting some sort of major change in the music industry, having to do with techno and rock. George Clinton has successfully made that change, while not even trying. The new sound he's created still has that P-Funk sound to it, but you can easily tell that if funk were to ever change, this is the direction it should be headed. Give it a shot."
4,Dope Dogs,Not necesesly a clasic but for George Clinton fans a must have giving you the funk from begging to end
4,Coyote Myths,"I bought this book because I am mainly interested in Coyote mythology. This book has a large section devoted to tales containing the Coyote in one context or another. All in all, there is approximatly 100 pages of Coyote ""tails."" This includes a section devoted to the ""Coyote Cycle"" reguarding animal myths."
2,not great for the tourist,"I bought this in anticipation of a 10-day holiday in Japan, wanting a basic grasp on a traveler's vocabulary. The first several chapters of this series just struck me as random sentences. While they are grouped into topics (Introductions, Eating & drinking, etc), you just get a few stock sentences (""Do you have any cakes?"") but no topical vocabulary lists - so what if I don't want cake, but sushi? I'm putting this aside and buying the Berlitz phrasebook."
4,good price,These batteries are manufactured in China ( it says it all over the box and the product ). They are a truly generic product and have no company name written on them. But that's ok as they perform pretty good. I am not sure how much charge they really hold or if the Panasonic charger that comes with FZ20 can charge them up to their full capacity. However what I know is that they perform at least on par with the original Panasonic battery ( do last more but not really double ). I would have liked a double battery very much but even at the current level these batteries are worth the money. They are cheap and work well. Not much more that I could ask for.
5,Great Foam,Used this to make a rock wall in my saltwater tank. The rock pieces I used adhered rather well. I made the mistake of laying it above newspaper which it stuck to.. and took forever to get off with a small knife. Next time I would try standing the wall up. If applying outside you should not have this problem.
5,Great stuff,"This product did exactly what I hoped for, and while it wasnt all that good at filling cracks over 1 1/2 inches wide it was perfect for smaller openings. It was easy to use, and to get into small spaces, it solidified well within the stated time and was very easy to cut and shape. I will definitly be using this product again."
2,Too little at too much cost,"The exact same compound found in most stores works just as well. goes much further and blends fairly well to natural products such as stone, sand, etc. This product is a ""rip off"" because of the supposedly intended use."
5,knock-out story and wonderful writing,"The Language of Light is a perfect curl-up-on-the-sofa and spend a rainy day reading kind of book! The characters feel as real as good friends, and I loved the glimpse into the world it portrays. Best of all, the writing is lovely!"
3,Disappointing ending,"I love the way Meg Waite Clayton writes. I thoroughly enjoyed this book until ending, which came abruptly and left many questions unanswered. The story was lovely, just not complete."
4,who's your caddy,Entertaining book revealing hidden characteristics of golf personalities. Particularly interesting to those who play the game and follow the pro tour.
4,for golfers,"This was another gift for my grandson and he hasn't had a chance to read it yet but if it has to do with golf, he'll love it!"
4,Laugh-out-loud funny,"Talk about inside the ropes! ""Who's Your Caddy"" makes ""A Good Walk Spoiled"" look like it was researched and written in Feinstein's basement. Reilly not only gets inside the ropes, but inside the players' heads and family lives, and in John Daley's case inside his jockstrap. He's also a master story teller. His profiles of Lehman, Daley and Duval alone are worth the price of admission."
1,Save Your Money,"Juvenile. Puerile. Sophomoric. Disappointing. I'm sure there are other perfect words to describe this book, but they don't come to mind immediately. As a golf fan, I expected so much more from this book than it delivers. I expected an inside look at what makes pro golfers tick, but what I got were, in no particular order of either ""Boring"" or ""Who cares?"", the following topics:1. How Donald Trump cheats2. How beautiful Donald's live-in is3. How Deepak Chopra deludes himself (read the section, then refer to any of Bill Murray's monologues in ""Caddyshack"")4. How amazed Reilly was/is at the size of John Daly's penis (Seriously... it's in there)5. Which LPGA stars are sleeping with each other6. Which LPGA stars are sleeping with other players' caddiesAnd on and on and on.... In a nutshell, save your money. This was the worst book I've read in a long, long time."
3,I'm not a golfer...,"I'm not a golfer, I bought this for my husband who is. However we did have this lying around one day so I picked it up and started reading. I really enjoyed the chapters for people that I recognized but I'm sure I lost some of the inside jokes had I known who some of the other people were. All in all though I found it a good read the whole way through."
2,"""Quite Distasteful"" Old Chap","The book starts off well, but the chapter about John Daly is really distasteful. Irony is, Reilly falls into the hole he dug for Daly. Some of the things the golfers did and said to Mr. Reilly were obviously not meant to be published. However, Mr. Reilly betrays their confidence in hopes of some cheap laughter at their expense. Pro-golfers will take a dim view. This book could have been great, but cheap tricks and crude language are never funny, Mr. Reilly. And the chapter on the lady golfer reeks of sexism. This book may only earn Mr. Reilly the ""John Daly"" of sportwriters title, and not much respect from tour players."
2,He phoned this one in,"As I finished the book, I realized that it annoyed me that Reilly took up caddying without really trying to learn how to do it. He started at the Masters with no experience and didn't do very well. He didn't seem to improve much . . . even with experience. I thought he showed a fundamental disrespect for his craft, the game and for the golfers he served by taking this approach. Thinking about my reaction, I thought about the responsibility we all have to do our best to serve others when that is our task. I'll try to do it much better after reading this book."
2,"Who's Your Caddy: Looping for the Great, Near Great, and Rep","Disappointing. Reilly is a better writer. The book is not so much about caddying, as the title might suggest, as it is a series of lightweight, cliched personality pieces about a variety of golfers, professional and recreational, and pseudo-golfers (that is, big stakes golf gamblers). Was the book edited? As just one glaring example, in the chapter about David Duval Reilly recounts Jack Nicklaus giving advice to David Duval during a practice round at the 1992 U.S. Open while standing on the famous 18th tee. Why not ""the famous 18th tee at Pebble Beach,"" or wherever? I follow golf, but I can't recall the course where the 1992 Open was played. I'd put the book in the ""browse at the beach"" category."
4,VERY INFORMATIVE ABOUT GOLFERS AND THE TOUR,Enjoyed the book but felt like he carried it to far with the John Daly chapter. Did not tell what was in all the golfers bag he caddied for like he did Dalys.
1,Can I give no stars?,"Reilly is the master of the one-liner -- the hacked-out, ridiculously over-the-top one-liner. Want to know what John Daly is packing behind his zipper? Reilly is your man. Want to know what Nicklaus thinks of Reilly's ""looping"" ability? Get this book. Want to hear Donald Trump go on and on and on about the waterfall he built on his new golf course? Reilly has the goods.Poor Reilly. He thinks he's funny. No, he is convinced that he's HILARIOUS. He's not. He's a hack who, every blue moon, writes a decent column for Sports Illustrated. This book is to be avoided at all costs.Wamt to know what an unhappy, seething reader who wants his money back looks like, Rick? Come find me."
1,Worst BOOK EVER!!!,"I made the mistake of buying two Rick Reilly Books because I like sports and I enjoy humor. This book was a disappointment on many levels. Not worth your time. This book is not funny. Don't waste your money and if you have insane amounts of money and can waste it, don't waste your time on this book."
1,not what I'd expected,"I purchased this book with the intention of teaching myself to read blue prints however was disappointed to find that it is a copy (and a bad one at that) of a work which is evidently considered to be a historical document, and essentially useless for my purposes as the top half of each and every page is blank. The copy fills only the bottom half, and the last third of the text/prints are cut off, as if the original were larger than the current page and no action was taken to correct the problem before the book went to print. I can't see its value as a historical reproduction, as so much of the information is missing. It is, in my opinion a total waste of money, and I would advise anyone looking at this book for any sort of technical knowledge to look elsewhere."
5,The dictionary is balanced and readable.,"This is the best of the philosophy ""dictionaries"". Far from a bias toward the East or against the Continent, the CDP has one fairly obvious selection critieria. Anybody still alive doesn't get in. There is no Derrida, but there is also no Putnam, no Davidson, no Searle, no Rorty, no Habermas, and so on. Each of these philosophers are discussed in articles about particular ideas. They just don't have biographical entries. The only serious quarrel I have concerns the use of the word ""dictionary"". Many basic philosophical terms are omitted and the articles, though coherent, balanced and readable, are of encyclopedic length. Looks more like a small encyclopedia of philosophy to me."
5,Indispensable reference for philosophy graduate students,"This dictionary is handy for quickly learning the basics about a philosopher or idea. The entries are concise, and I find the definitions of analytic terms especially helpful for precise understanding. When I started graduate school, I used it enough that I decided to buy a second copy so that I could keep one at home and one at the office."
3,"Good for Analytic, but Oxford Companion is Better","I have used both the Oxford Companion to Philosophy and this dictionary. I prefer the Oxford Companion because it contains more definitions and clearer expositions. But both books neglect recent Continental types of philosophy; yet, the Oxford fares much better in this regard than the Cambridge."
2,Disappointing,"The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy does contain entries of adequate length for such a publication. However, there are lamentable absences (ie: no entry for Derrida). Also, this dictionary does exhibit a strong bias in favour of eastern thought. These factors detract greatly from the quality of this work."
4,A useful reference work.,"As a classicist/medievalist I have found this book to be very useful as a reference work while working on my own areas of study (intellectual life in late antiquity and the high middle ages). I suspect that other people working in different philosophical fields would find this work just as useful, as this edition covers a wide variety of philosophers from vastly different times and places. As someone who is generally interested in philosophy and the history of ideas, I often enjoy browsing the sections on individual modern, postmodern and Asian philosophers, and so I have found this book to be helpful in expanding my own intellectual horizons. Anyone else seriously interested in ideas and/or their academic study will also find this volume both interesting and rewarding."
4,review corrected-better than the Oxford dic.,"Previous review corrected: after using the Oxford dictionary for some time, and then returning to the Cambridge one, I found out that this is absolutely better, more extensive and comprehensive. Oxford dic. has a more amiable format with bibligraphies etc. but the coverage of this one is far broader.Well, okay, this may be the best available of its kind.. but still poor in many respects. Tainted by a ridiculous multi-culturalist concern which doesnt befit a serious philosophical attitude.. philosophical concepts are mostly absent outside the current analytic terms, and continental philosophy seems to be represented in terms of a poor treatment of certain important figures rather than serious explication of relevant concepts.. If youre a student of analytic philosophy you'll find important concepts like truth tables or coherentism covered in detail.. that is the only satisfactory aspect of this dictionary."
4,Really strong one-volume resource.,"I think the Encyclopedia of Philosophy is the best English reference work on the subject (see my review for that item). However, it's hard to take that four-volume set wherever one goes, so I picked this up, and am pretty pleased with it.The coverage is thorough and the entries are, for the most part, pretty thorough, also. I recommend it for someone looking for a single-volume survey of major figures and ideas. I hear Oxford has a good cyclopedia of philosophy, also, but I got this because I have several other one-volume-type resources from Oxford, so... you know, variety."
3,mediocre,"Author has agenda as to what should be considered philosophy and included. Examples: The economist John Maynard Keynes rates an entry while ther are no entries for Jacques Derrida, differance, or Khora. Would like a philosophy dictionary that gives me a definition of hyperousiological rather than a listing of every person who lived and published a paper with the word philosophy in it."
5,The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy,Excellent reference book and well organized. A great read. It is a large book and easy to read.
4,"Very satisfying. But sure enough, an hour later...","This fine reference performs its function admirably, cataloguing the most important milestones in the history of philosophy and explaining abstruse ideas in clear language. What it really lacks, though, is some good ethnic jokes."
3,Sort of Helpful,"The organization of this book sucks. It's alphabetical, but most of the contents for vocab terms say ""See..."" and give no page reference or anything. The book is really long, probably longer than the Bible, but it does have some helpful hints. It is, however, written just like my lectures, which is a bad thing. It could be clearer and less annoying. My class said this book was ""not required"" and now I know why."
4,Decent computer value,"I have had my A15-S129 for over 3 years now and it still serves me well. Some other reviewers complain of poor quality, but I believe they have handled it rough. I agree that some problems such as overheating can occur if you are watching videos. The power required to run such a multimedia task can push the limits of the system. Make sure the vents are not obstructed. The battery run time is short compared to some others, but if your use is with the power adapter most of the time it won't be a problem. My battery needed replacing after 2 years. The graphics speed is very good, but not enough for serious gamers.I will be getting a new computer soon and I would consider a Toshiba again.UPDATE: I have retired this laptop, but not before one of the lid hinges failed and the lip could not stay up with just one intact hinge. I used it for 5 years which is probably a reasonable life span for a laptop. I've since gotten a HP G60. I'll write a review for it soon."
3,Affordable - but comes with a catch !!,"Bought this on Black Friday 2003. Thankfully I purchased a 3 year warranty because I used it up! Two power adapters, two displays, and a cooling fan replaced. This thing runs slow and HOT. I upgraded another 512 of memory and checked the cooling fan and it is working. Unit runs so hot it shuts itself down. Last week it finally told me why, the harddrive started grinding and crashed! Now I need to decide if the cost of a new HDD is even worth it. I may just put the money into another unit instead."
2,Average.,"It has a mediocre processor at best (Celerons are just awful at handling graphics), very little RAM, a small hard drive, a very puny graphics card (32 megs, but they must have figured 'why waste graphic horsepower to push a Celeron'), and no wireless connectivity. Also, it is neither svelte nor is it cheap.I can fully understand the concept and occasional appropriateness of bare-bones, entry level machines but I would suggest the interested buyer also consider the Gateway 200 or the Averatec 3150."
2,Very poor quality computer--multiple repairs,"I have had my A15 for about 2.5 years now...they system has worked well but several parts have either cracked or failed over this time. First, the cooling fan tore itself apart and had to be completely replaced. Next the AC power connector cracked. Additionally, the hinges on the monitor are very loose and conventional wisdom is that they need to be replaced with new (not used) laptop hinges which cost about 100 each (one for each side of the monitor!). Now the headphone jack has a short in it and sometimes the speakers work after plugging in a headphone and sometimes not. The system has very poor battery life and heats up much more so than other laptops I have used. I will never buy another Toshiba...its construction stinks! Again, the system itself works fine...but these ""side"" problems make it more irritating that it's worth. I would strongly NOT buying this machine."
3,OK for the money,"I use it to check mail and for web browsing.Quite OK for the purpose.Feels (plastics) a little cheap.But watch out for the rebate delays. Bought the computer 3 months back and mailed the rebate form within a week and opted for extra battery instead of cash. Last month they said there is a 4-6 week delay in getting it. As of last week it is still 4-6 week delay due to the battery being on backorder. If I opt for cash now, it is still going to take another 4 weeks to receive the check.Meanwhile, I was able to order the same back-ordered battery from Toshiba website without any problem.Let me see if they ever ever send the rebate cash or battery.So, inspite of the laptop being a good machine at a good price, I may not buy a Toshiba product again."
4,yep,"I have recently baught one, it is a good computer. Got a good deal on it, which made it afordable, it even plays my games well."
4,Fun History,"Fun history for children. Yes the Chicken and the ship are not to scale (about 1/32) But kids don't care,use these with children books on James town and acquire other toob sets for more history and more fun."
4,Great playset!,"My grandson loves this. I only wish the characters were a bit larger. Having been to Jamestown a number of times, I appreciate the variety of characters and objects--especially the ship, which was a big hit with the grandson. It's an educational set and entertains children with vivid imaginations."
3,"Good detail, size proportions bad","Like other Toob figures size proportions limit playablity. Pieces have molded-in ""leans"" so peices fall easily. Historic figure detailing fairly good."
2,Not much of Jamestown,"I bought this for an office prank- long story- but as with all the toobs, there is no clear story, the scale is a bit off- the chicken and the pig are the same size, the ship a bit bigger. There is better stuff out there."
4,Basil Willing + A Haunted Room = Fun Reading,"I ""discovered"" Helen McCloy by reading ""Cue For Murder"" (which remains my favorite of her Basil Willing stories.) This one takes place later in his career and is entertaining on its own. Only problem I had was that even I could figure out the solution well in advance (which I usually cannot accomplish no matter how many mysteries I read.) But I recommend it for lovers of ""golden age"" mysteries. (Especially if you can't find ""Cue for Murder."")"
1,"Great pictures, bad historically","Apparently the author was a collector on the US mainland since he apparently did not do much historical research in Hawaii. The dates are usually off about ten years. Also from his book you'd think all Hawaii produced were rayon shirts when cottons, in Asian prints, have been most common!"
3,Pretty pictures; not terribly informative,"I've been told Steele's take on history is somewhat spotty; I'm not an expert so I can't confirm or deny that. To be honest, I've never even read the text. But the photos are numerous and great; there are over 125 full shirts in full color, many of them full-page as well. That makes the book perfect as an painting resource, which is what I use it for. If you're a fabric designer, costumer or artist, or just dreaming of the islands in their jet-set days of Lana Turner and Elvis Presley, this book is a good resource."
2,...not for the historically accurate collector.,"While this book does show some nice photos, it fails to deliver accurate information. The dates on MANY of the shirts are off by about 10 years or so and the book does very little to help the serious collector or anyone with more than just a passing interest. A much more informative book is 'Hawaii Unbuttoned' by Craig Callaway."
5,of turk art,I'm student and I have very intrese for the ottoman art for islamic. the miniature of this kultur s very nice.
3,Intelligent and spiritual interview,"This is a 30 minute interview with George Harrison and Ravi Shankar in 2003, the interviewer being a Frenchman, the questions not translated into English, so I didn't understand any of the questions, yet it didn't really matter.George said that he isn't a particularly good musician or songwriter, and that he loves Indian music. He said he could churn out hundreds of trite songs, but the only songs he would be interested in writing would be spiritually valuable songs.He shared his philosophy that we are eternal souls living in mortal bodies, and while the body changes throughout our lives, the soul does not change. He described life as a play written by God in which we are playing the parts.It was nice to see George. He is an old friend, for us in the hippie generation. It's nice to see such an intelligent and spiritual man."
3,A little bit different than what I was expecting....,"I love Terrence Parker's work. Most of what I already have is either earlier soulful house side projects or his equally fun work with Seven Grand Housing Authority. He is one of those artists that definitely has a way with chords and song structures that makes your body move while tugging at your heartstrings a little. I bought this album expecting much the same. However, I was surprised to discover that this has a more introspective and possibly autobiographical feel to it. The tracks are mostly downtempo (80-100 bpm I think), but the feel is still his, especially on the piano driven slow burner ""Real Love"". It's a good example of how you can take very few elements and make a track significant enough to rival more multi-layered efforts. If you like the feel of house music, but prefer your tempo at more of a hip-hop speed, you should buy this album."
5,Excelent choice,There is not much to say other than this is finally what i wanted...i waited few months trying to find a right rack and by accident i saw this one in a restaurant. I did my research and use amazon to do the purchase and im happy with my wine rack.
2,Not to be trusted,"I recently heard a presenter say Apache performed by Jorgen Ingmann was written by Ingmann,he told me this inaccurate statement is in Jacobs book,wrong it was written by Brit Jerry Lordan so how many other mistakes in the book?"
1,"Well, yes you can break this Trowel!","Purchased this set as I have, in the past, found Fiskars to be a good product. However, while digging weeds from my garden; the head snapped from the handle. Although the head is metal, inside the handle, it is attached via a Plastic insert. The plastic is attached to the head and then pressure inserted into the handle. Pressure on the handle in the digging motion can Snap the handle and it cannot be repaired. Not a good design."
2,Not Incredibly Sturdy,"So, having read all of the amazing reviews on these garden tools, and hoping to get into a little gardening for the first time this year, I decided to make the purchase. However, as I was opening the package, one of the tines on the Cultivator snapped off. I have yet to ask for a replacement or return these, but I did not expect to have a broken set of tools before I even hit the dirt. Besides the breakage, the tools themselves seem well-made, which makes the break even that much more puzzling."
2,Shovel broke first day,"I own all my garden tools through Fiskars. This set I was excited about, but the first day of planting tomato plants my handle broke. My ground isn't rocky or dry, the shovel broke like you would expect a Wal-Mart shovel. Was so dissapointed, as all my other tools are high quality Fiskars, i.e. rakes, shears, shovel etc."
5,This was a gift.,"As I haven't heard any complaints about them I suppose they are good, or at least good enough :) My wife did use them as well, and she thought they were OK."
2,Would not buy again,"I forgot who I bought these items from online, but the digging tool ends are blunt causing you to work harder trying to break up soil, I would have preferred the tips to be alittle more sharper."
5,Garden tool set,I love the set. It has been made with the best material. I know I'm going to enjoy using them when I start my spring planting in my flower pots and yard.
2,"Bought it last year, 2 out of 3 broke","I wasn't using it too hard and kept it out in the sun for roughly only 1 month. Next time I used the cultivator, it broke as I was trying to dig out some weeds with it. The trowel (without the measuring lines) also broke quickly (within another month of use) but that was partly my fault as I was exerting a bit too much force to dig away at some hardened clay-like soil. Only item still working is the trowel with the measuring lines."
4,"Large enough to get the job done, small enough for a woman's hands","I bought these because they would fit in the Fiskars Garden Bucket Caddy that I ordered at the same time. I was kind of leery at first because the handles looked large. A lot of the garden tools you find these days, especially the ones with soft handles, have such large handles that they are practically unusable for women like me with small hands. I have only had them for a few days, but they seem well made and durable.I would recommend them to anyone, but especially to people with small hands."
3,There OK...a year later,"I've had these tools for over a year now and so far they have held up pretty well, they are solid for the price. I don't have much use for the weeder, I mainly use the transplanter, I do quite a bit of planting and even when using gloves the handle can really wear on your hands. I wouldn't really say these are ""softtouch"" with my blisters. Take a look at the other gardening tools here on Amazon, such as a hori hori if you do alot of transplanting."
3,"According to the State of California, these tools contain lead.","This is a heavy duty garden tool set that is manufactured in China. I was really impressed with the heft of the tools. They have come in handy this summer. My major issue is that these tools have the California label that mentions that they may contain lead. This is not mentioned on Amazon.com. I am a bit of a hypochondriac, so it still freaks me out."
4,Great price for a great set of garden tools,"My wife recently came in from the garden where she was planting garlic for late planting season and exclaimed that she loved her new garden tools. It seems that every time I would use her trowel, I bent it and she bought another cheapo to replace it. This year I bought her this set and she could not be happier. They are solid and husband-proof."
2,NOT made in the USA,"I purchased these because they were advertised on Amazon as being made in the USA. They are not. Stamped right on the metal parts is CHINA. So, if you want to buy a product made in the United States, this is not it."
1,very cheaply made,One of the three pieces broke the first time I used it- it snapped in two as soon as I put it in the soil. I'm sure the others will do the same- these were not built to last.
5,Great Bargain and Saved me from a Spider!,"I was excited to dig around in my flower beds with these. They worked great -- light and durable. Great bargain for the money! Plus there was a Black Widow hiding under some old brick, and I totally killed it with the little shovel. After that, they earn my seal of approval!"
5,Fiskar garden tool set,I bought 2 sets for my daughter for Christmas. I have the same set and have used and enjoyed them for years.
2,What a huge waste of money...,"This DVD contains six rounds. The questions are the same everytime you play that round. So once you've played one of the rounds, you know all the answers. For the price, that sux. I expected different random questions every game, not so. I bought this game because it's packaged like it's a rock based game. (Guy with the Les Paul guitar on the front of the box, Lollapalooza sample question on back, and it comes with a Hard Rock Cafe poster which the box for the game has their logo all over it) so I bite. Then the game has questions about country artist Clay Aiken and the rapper 50 Cents. What's up with that? Plus the game's main theme music is C+C Music Factory's ""Gonna Make You Sweat"". It was still rather enjoyable, except the DVD kept freezing up. So overall, avoid it unless you can find it for five bucks or less!!!"
2,Fun game while it lasts (which isn't long),"I really enjoyed this game at first and loved playing it with our friends. BUT, after playing the 6 games you're done. What a waste for the money. You basically get 6 hours of playtime total and you might as well throw the game out. Big Bummer. Wish I bought the Scene It Music edition instead..."
3,"Fun Game, but short shelf life","My family got this game about 2 years ago when it first came out. It was a lot of fun for the whole family, my cousin was 12 at the time, and it was her favorite game to play on Family Game Night. However, if you like quiet games, this isn't the one for you. The entire family will end up screaming out the answers. The best part was Battle of the Bands, which is a lot like the game Planet Hollywood. They give you a category (Bands with one word names,etc.) and you have to give answers one team at a time. Whichever team can't think of anymore or repeats an answer loses the challenge.The biggest problem with this game is that it only comes with 6 games, so once you've played all of them you're done. You can play them again if you wait about a year or if everyone playing has a really bad memory."
3,Worth a listen,"Bought this mainly for their cover of ""Lovesong"", and that's pretty much the high point of the album. They have an interesting sound, but the songs pretty much all sound alike, except for the two covers. Add this to a mix, so you get the songs one at a time, they sound pretty good, but when taken one after another they start to drone. Tobey has an awesome voice, but when a band is just two people and only one writes the music, you don't get much variation in sound, unfortunately. Add in another guitar player and/or a drummer, and they might have had something that lasted more than one album. To summarize, I should have just downloaded the single, but then again, this might be more to your tastes than mine."
2,Jesus,This group totally destroys two excellent songs created by two other excellent artists. You can tell just by listening to love song and how soon is now? to get an idea of how boring and uncreative this band is both vocals and sound.
4,Rock Music you can Dance To?,"This debut album from Snake River Conspiracy (SRC) is an interesting blend of Hard Rock and Techno. It ends up sounding somewhere between Garbage and Industrial Techno. Most of the songs are pretty good with ""Breed"" and ""Vulcan"" being the two stand out tracks on the album. The only weak song on album has to be the song ""Somebody Hates You"". My only major problem with this debut album is that it features two covers, the Cure's ""Lovesong"" and the Smith's ""How Soon Is Now?"". While they did a pretty good job with the covers, having two if them seems unnecessary and takes away from their original tracks (especially since there are only 11 tracks). Overall, the quality of the songs is above average and I prefer ""Sonic Jihad"" to the latest Garbage offering ""Beautiful Garbage"". Any fan of Garbage should check this out."
5,how soon is now? and vulcan,"this cd is a very good one, but it's not like ""vulcan"". Vulcan and how soon is now? are my two favorites. i recommend this cd. it's really good"
5,They just rock!,This band just plane rocks...sure a couple of songs on their cd do not need to be on their becuase they just dont go with the reast of the songs...I saw them in concert in Ft. Worth when they opend for APC i was not only amazed by the awesome sond they put out but how hott she was.
2,An appropriate album name,"An appropriate album name since I usually associate a jihad with something negative.This album really doesn't hold up that well. Sure it has a few decent songs like ""Breed"" and ""Oh Well"" and I guess I kind of like ""More Than Love"", but for the most part these songs are pretty bad.Also, just as an aside, the intro to ""Strangled"" sounds a lot like the intro to the song from the opening credits of Goldfinger. Just an observation."
5,one of the greatest albums ever recorded,this combination of edge and sensuality is a masterpiece. this is easily one of the 10 cds i'd take to the moon with me.
4,Cool album!!!,"I had to listen to this CD a few times before i got a 'feel' for it and could really get into each song. Good lyrics, cool vocals, alot of variety and additions in each song! Very original and very fun. Great beats and tunes and simply an awesome album!!!"
4,A different album from most,"I bought this album based on a single song (the cover of The Smiths' How Soon Is Now?) that I had heard on an online alternative station. I listened to the sound clips that Amazon had available and decided to take a chance. I was well rewarded. This album is a odd blend of punk and new age, withhaunting vocal and brash intrumentals. I found the mix to be one I enjoy a great deal."
4,Interesting tidbit,"Okay, maybe only interesting to me. I just realized why 'Breed' sounds familiar. The intro and brass parts are sampled from the original 'Planet of the Apes' movie (just before Heston yells out his 'Get your stinkin' paws off me' line).Overall, a great album."
5,"Perfect fit, pretty easy to install","It fit my unit, and works, but I did not keep it on the vac, I just cleaned up my old one and it worked again. But I'm keeping this one as a replacement when the original eventually does go out."
3,Works well,"I bought this a few years ago to replace the original that the bristles had all but worn down. It works great as a replacement. I did run into an issue, though. If you happen to vacuum up damp carpets (using the carpet absorbers, etc), you may eventually have a problem like I did where I hadn't used my DC07 for a while (its my backup/spare) and found that the brush bar was seized up. Turns out the bearings had rusted through and seized, so I ended up having to replace it again. It was probably due to the accumulated hair/fur/fibers that collected around the bearings getting damp and promoting rust. Sure, it lasted a few years, but that was with really infrequent use. I'm assuming it uses cheaper bearings that are not stainless steel, hence the rusting, which is not exactly ideal since its not like the consumer is expected to ""lubricate"" these areas for rust prevention.Anyway, the replacement works great out of the box and if you never vacuum damp carpet, then you shouldn't have an issue."
3,"Good item, not quite Dyson quality though.","Since there is no way to order a new brush from Dyson, it's the next best thing. The seller is wonderful, unfortunatly due to patents you can't clone the same thing."
2,Not my favorite,"While the author made some strong and lyrical points in the book, I didn't think it constituted it's 300+ pages of self-commentary. I love cerebral books, but this was was drowning in... I don't know how to say it. I would read a few pages at night trying my hardest to finish the book and I'd fall asleep... That's how disappointed I was in the book. Anything that puts me to sleep instead of keeps me up reading is not the book for me. I finished it, but I doubt I will remember it."
2,an unfinished book,I could not get into this book. I found it tedious and boring and could not care for the characters. Social commentary in your story is fine but this felt like nothing but social commentary. I have had the book for several months and will probably never finish it; it puts me to sleep.
2,what a snore,"Other than ""Answering Machine"" this basically is a boring record. This is not worth the money."
1,damn long time,It took almost one whole month to get my cd and once it was here I had to shell out more money to get it from ups. Not a happy camper at all
3,Between great and bad,"This is a decent enough album. If you liked her ""Garden"" album, this one is much the same, with spritely music overlying cooing lyrics about love. It doesn't set my world on fire, but it's eminently listenable."
3,So so,"I really loved ""The Garden"", but this CD was only so so for me.What I liked about her other CD was how unapologetically fun and cheesy it was. This CD seemed a little blah. It wasn't bad, but it didn't have much that jumped out for me."
4,Should have been released now,"I believe if ""Between The Days"" was released now the album would have had better sales than it did in 1998. At the time of this review I can't recall the artist that this album sounds like, which is not doing the album justice. In my opinion, if you come across the Australian or Japanese edition of Between The Days with Merril Bainbridge covering ""I Got You Babe"", is to skip the song. The song is a reggae duet with Jamaican rapper Shaggy and does not fit on the album."
1,Caution...May not be who you think it is.,"This is not the 80's pop group featuring Claudia Brucken, Michael Mertens, Susanne Freytag, and Ralf Dorper. This is Jason Petty, a West Coast based youth pastor and member of the Tunnel Rats crew. I have not listened to this album but I rated it 1 star because he should not have used the name of another group. I guess expecting a new album by the real Propaganda was just ""Wishful Thinking""."
2,Best of Lobo,"The recordings on this CD are not the original hits heard on the radio. These were recorded at a later time at a totaly different recording session. It was advertised and sold as Lobo's original hits. Sorry, I wasn't fooled!"
1,Headed For The Trash,"We bought the 10-quart version of this pressure cooker 18 months ago to replace one that no longer worked well after 20+ years. When the new one arrived, the lid seemed to be slightly malformed and the cooker would not hold pressure. We returned it to NESCO under warranty, and its replacement arrived with three broken feet and a defective gasket. NESCO replaced these parts, again under warranty, and we ruined several meals before we gave up on it for a while. Yesterday it seemed to be doing fine --no steam leaks, pressure controller working ok -- when there was a sudden explosion of steam and liquid from under the lid. We think the gasket may have blown out, although there is no apparant defect in it. It's out of warranty now, and headed for the trash can. We will not buy another NESCO product."
3,Great Pad / Breaks Often,"This pad is better than any other pad I've used (I have used 3 other types). I slips less than others with a similar form and doesn't feel weird like the thick foam ones. Also, it picks up most stomps, unlick the arcade pads (the ones I've used were inset, so my foot would get caught about a centimeter above the arrows sometimes). That being said, this pad breaks fairly often with intense use (I've gone through about 4 myself with about a year of intense play) and it does slip a little. If you are willing to replace them every now and then, don't mind a little slipping (less than others), and don't like the other pads for whatever reasons, get these... they are usually priced cheap too."
3,Hmm...,"Today is day 5 of taking this multivitamin. I happened to stumble across it in my pantry and thought, ""why not""? I've been on a new health kick (eating much healthier and working out daily) so I'm hoping this will give me an extra boost. I eat a granola bar for breakfast because I don't have much time in the morning to make a gourmet meal. I take this right before I leave for work and about 5 minutes later I'm hit with a terrible weird nausea feeling. I do feel like I may up-chuck, but I'm able to hold it down. It only lasts for about 1 minute, and then I'm fine the rest of the day. Considering it's only been 5 days, I can't comment on any results. But if you have a weak stomach, I don't suggest taking this. This vitamin must obviously work over time, because if it didn't, it would have been pulled from the shelves a long time ago. I'm going to try and tough it out!"
1,"Do not use! Terrible! Sick, nausea, vomiting!","This pill is TERRIBLE! My girl friend and I, early 20's, tried these to get more vitamins and of course, boost our metabolism, get more energy, and lose some weight... UGH. Without food, just head to the bathroom or grab the nearest trash can, IMMEDIATELY! It's like someone punching you in the stomach. But even WITH food, we STILL got nauseated, BAD stomachaches, and vomiting. It does give a bit of an energy boost that feels like crack (j/k) for a short period, but it is NOT at ALL worth all the pain, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, headache, CHEST TIGHTNESS, and uncomfortable feelings that come with it. When 90% of these reviews are telling you the same, bad side effects, do NOT use!"
1,Violently Ill,"I have had good experience with other One a Day vitamins and bought this one. I have taken it twice and both times I have been violently ill. I am not sensitive to caffeine, but something in this vitamin makes me vomit within minutes of taking it. They need to rework the formula. I do not recommend this vitamin."
1,OMG I took this 15 minutes ago and I feel horribly sick.....,I wish I would of researched this vitamin before taking it today was my first day trying it I started coughing within second of taking this vitamin and threw up some of the food I hate with it....After that happened my throat started hurting an feeling swallow and it's hard to swallow now. Then my top of my mouth feels so irritated! Now i'm getting a headache and a stomach ache. I do not recommend this crap for anyone I was fine before taking this pill felt great an energetic ready to go to the gym and now I feel like laying in bed and throwing up! I tried this for a extra dose of energy and hoping it would help me get to my goal weight I never in my life thought a vitamin could make me feel so horrible.
1,DO NOT USE!!!,"I thought that since this had the One a Day name, it would be a safe supplement to take to help lose a couple of pounds. The first day I took it, I vomited within ten minutes of taking the vitamin, even though I took it with food like it suggests. I had an upset stomach and vomited on and off throughout the rest of the day. I decided to give it a second chance, but the same thing happened the next day. I'm not sensitive to medication or supplements or anything, so it's just the vitamin. I wish I could give it zero stars, but unfortunately that's not an option. A couple pounds is definitely NOT worth being sick all day everyday. I will not continue to use this vitamin and strongly encourage others not to start. One a Day should look into a safe way to aid your metabolism, not one that makes you sick. Extremely disappointed in this product!"
3,"So far, So Good","Today is just my second day taking this little miracle pill, and I've had no problems. I started working out about three weeks ago, but I haven't been able to shake this sluggish feeling. I would wake up exhausted, (which didn't help during my work day). At night, I could barely keep my eyes open. I purchased these vitamins from Publix just to see if they could help me make through the day. My energy improved tremendously. In reading the reviews, it appears everyone has experienced nausea. I would highly recommending eating with these vitamins and also be sure to read the ingredients. I made the mistake of taking a multi-vitamin on an empty stomach and ended up feeling terrible for the remainder of the day. I didn't want to give 5 stars just yet, since I've just started, but I will update. Also if you're taking any medications, double-check with your doctor."
2,Beware!!!,This is not my first time trying a One A Day Women s pill. I used to take active mind and body but couldn't find it anywhere. I do want to loose a bit of weight so I decided to try the Active Metabolism and well just like most of the people who have taken it I threw up. Just ten min after taking it I had to pull to the side of the road but the pill was still in my system so during the day it gave me incredible gas(basically makes you want to go #2). To tell you the truth though the active mind and body used to make me sick as well but not the point of actually needing to throw up. The whole day I had a headache and just felt very sick. This pill is not for everyone so be aware of the side effects and if you are like me with a weak stomach when it comes to pills don't bother with this one.
1,Do Not Buy!!,"The first few times I took this it would make me nauseated but I was able to hold it down, I just figured that once I got used to it the feeling would pass. Well today I took it and had to run to the bathroom to throw up. Not worth the side effects!!! It will give you a little bit of energy IF you can keep it down!!! IEW"
1,BEWARE! Made me ill for months!,"I've been getting night terrors and vomiting for months, and I finally realized why. It has caffeine, so when I realized that it may be causing my night terrors and night illness, I switched to mornings. The first day, I had to pull over to the side of the road on my way to work to throw up. I stopped taking it, and Googled it today. It is causing MANY people night terrors and vomiting. All those sleepless nights and missed days of work...I'm almost in tears realizing it was just my stupid vitamin all along. Please don't take this...it almost ruined my life!"
1,great if you want to vomit your pounds away,"I was hoping this would be a great way to get my vitamins and also boost my weight-loss efforts... however, it only made me nauseated, and on one occasion, made me vomit. I stopped taking it after that."
1,Threw it up immediately,I was very excited to take this vitamin hoping it would give me a boost of energy. I took the vitamin after eating and within 5 minutes I threw it all up!! An hour later and I still feel sick and very weak. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. This is the first and last day I will be taking thirst vitamins. Huge wast of money.
1,Simply awful! Should be pulled from store shelves!,"The first day I took this supplement, I experienced dizziness and was queasy within hours. Felt faint and hot with prickly chills. Also felt the need to sit down to gather myself several times throughout the day. Takes overnight to feel better again. Drink lots of water to flush the yuck out! DO NOT take these! Can only be doing more harm that good. There's no reason that a vitamin should make you feel so ill."
4,Great product for gradual weight loss,"When I started taking One A Day Weight Smart I was weighting 220 pounds, 5 months later I was down to 165 pounds, a 55 pound loss!The pill works effectively but I did experience side effects such as frequent dreaming activity especially at the start and if taken without first having eaten a good meal expect some nasty stomachaches."
1,Stay away!,"I've been taking a variety of vitamins for decades and none have ever made me as sick as these. I took this vitamin on three separate days. The first time was in the morning after a small breakfast a few weeks ago. Shortly after, I threw up. The second time was right before bed last week. Within an hour, I threw up. The last time was just today about 30 minutes after lunch. I threw up within 15 minutes of taking it and have been dizzy and lightheaded all day.I'm not sure if it's the effects of the guarana seed but the rest of the bottle is going in the trash. I simply DO NOT recommend these pills."
4,sick...,"I notices that many people said that this product made them ill. The first few times I took it the same thing happened to me then I noticed that the bottle instructed to eat with food. That might help. Otherwise, it's a good vitamin. I'm not sure about the effect on metabolism yet; I'm still measuring that."
3,Good and Bad,"I have been taking this for a little while now and it makes me very nauseous. Yes, it did make me go to the bathroom and gave me a lot of energy but recently it has actually made me throw up everything i ate. If you are good with multivitamins than i recommend it but if not do not take."
2,Throwing up and no sleep!!!,"I recently started taking these vitamins. I have been unable to sleep at all since I started taking them. I lay in bed for hours wide awake but tired. On top of that I get horrible stomach aches, and if I dont eat a decent size meal with my pill I immediately throw up. I havn't been taking them long enough to know if they will help me lose weight, but at this point i don't know if i'm wanting to find out!!!"
4,Negative Comments Not Justified,"Im reading these reviews about all the people who got dizzy and sick from this pill. I have taken many other multivitamins, and if you take it on an empty stomache, you will get sick most likely. I think the directions even says take with food. So I take this after I eat, and Im fine! Yes I have barfed from it...but it was my own fault not eating with it. Read the instructions people before you slander a product/brand"
2,Makes me sick,"I was eager to try this because my friend told me it gave her a big energy kick. I read the directions and some of the reviews so I knew to take it after eating. However, even after eating it makes me really sick to my stomach. I feel like I am going to throw up -- even a couple hours later I will get a big waive of nausea. You just can't get through a day well feeling like that. I've been trying a couple weeks now hoping it would get better, but no such luck. I will not be able to take these anymore as a result and want to warn others to be careful. I tried varying types of food - amounts - no help. Good luck to those who try them."
1,So Glad I am not the only one.,"I am so glad I am not the only one getting nauseous after taking this vitamin. I thought it might be something else, I tried everything and it comes down to this pill making me sick! I am going to stop taking, not worth it. I will stick with my coffee for energy."
1,Felt nauseous.,"I took it once, right after lunch, felt nauseous. Will go back to regular Women's one a day. The Active Metabolism does not work for me."
1,Not worth it!,"This product did not help me lose any weight at all, and caused intense nausea. If I wasn't careful to always take it with a good meal, I would always vomit after taking it. I took it for about a month before I finally gave up, and since then I've had headaches, insomnia, and irritability. I wish I never would have started taking these!"
2,Mrs. Brown,I have not achieved any weight loss with One A Day Weight Smart. I believe it is just a vitamin with no weight loss benefit.
4,"the family ""package"" with its goods and bads..","I love Tony Parsons as a writer and I have read all of his previous books and finished this book in almost a day.its a very emotionally book that deals with the beautiful thing called: pregnancy, having a child and living as a couple.maybe the fact that I am pregnant at the moment and could easily relate to it and at some points I almost cried.... (really).but.... there were some medical ""facts"" that were mistakable and that made the enjoyable reading being less enjoyable..I loved it but it wasn't Parsons's best but still I recommend it to anyone who is expecting a baby, having a baby,planning to have one or just living with the great other..."
2,The Family Way,"Very trite, forced and one dimensional. Bought book in $1 discount rack and felt relieved when I finished it."
2,Primarily an art exhibition,"I bought this book hoping it would be a good reference for a report I am writing about the Huichols, for my cultural anthropology class. The book turns out to be essentially a showcase for the yarn art of Mariano Valdez, the husband of the author. While the art is colorful and interesting, the book did not serve my purpose of gathering detailed descriptive information on their sacred rituals, as the title suggests. The text basically describes, in short paragraphs, what each piece of art represents. It gaves some basic insight into Huichol deities and animal allies, but only in small snippets, so it is hard to put all of these puzzle pieces together to form a cohesive overall picture or understanding of their religious practices. A nice book of art, but not much else. It is also a fairly thin book -- not worth the price, in my opinion, unless you feel that the high-quality images of Valdez's artwork are worth it."
4,More than you can see,"This book is one of the few books that give insight to the beliefs of the Huichol Indians. While it is a thin book, it reveal a lot about their culture without revealing too much. While it does not tell you what they do in their peyote hunts, or ceremonies, it does showcase why they do conduct ceremonies which is just as if not more valuable that the details of a ceremony. The art work is fantastic as well as the photography. Concise language explains the meaning of the photos which reveals a people's belief in a higher power. I recommend this book for anyone who can read between the lines to see culture the exists there in the art."
4,An amazing look into the art of the Huichol,"I've travelled extensively through Mexico in search of a book that showed the art of the Huichol. This was the first and most complete book to show in detail the various yarn paintings and there meanings. It's a good look, for first timers, into the Huichols sacred rituals, the yarn painting. To those who have not seen the yarn paintings first hand, this book has excellent examples of what the Huichols have been creating for the last quarter of a century. Mariano and Susan Valadez have also included an over view of the Huichols myths and how their stories are depicted in the paintings. This book was recomended to me by a Huichol from Jalisco, Mexico; and now I recomend it to you."
4,"Sturdy Stand, Except...","I bought this for my wife who plays the violin. She really loves it and says it's perfect. Except the actual music holder, which folds up to hold all the metal stands is made up of ""not so great quality"" plastic. And when my wife opened the package, two broken pieces fell out of the box! I'm assuming that happened in shipping, with the metal bars moving around inside. It wasn't a crucial damage if you keep this assembled all the time. But that wasn't the case with us.But, Musician's Friend was really helpful when I contacted them and they're sending out a replacement unit right away, without us having to send the defective portion back and waiting weeks without a stand. Kudos to them!! Amazing Customer Service!"
1,Much lower quality than expected,"A friend recommended this to me, because of the convenience of folding away into it's own case. However, it doesn't have a handle, and it doesn't fit into any standard size bagThe music shelf is very flimsy as was previously noted, so I expect to be taking pieces in an out of my big music notebooks constantly. The stand back folds up to become the case, but it doesn't seem to lock when you unfold it, and the screws that tighten it aren't great. You constantly have to watch that it's not going to fold up and dump the music.I used the stand three times, and the ring that allows the height adjustment just snapped. Not as I was adjusting it, but as I was sitting and playing. The whole group stopped playing to have a laughing fit, but fortunately it was just a rehearsal.I'm hoping that the merchant will agree to replace or refund this item, but all in all, I am very disappointed in this product."
1,Not good quality,"This product arrived in pieces - the sides of the folding part were all cracked open. It was shipped with no padding in the box, but the plastic it's made of is flimsy and brittle, so I don't know that it would have helped. The shelf that holds the music is very thin plastic and does not lock on tightly, cannot hold books, only sheet music, because it's too flimsy. The legs are sturdy but very heavy, you might as well get a regular metal stand. The stand is very short, you can't use it if you stand to play or sing. The fold out knobs do not lock the stand open, it keeps collapsing. I just threw it out because it was such a pain to use and could not hold my music books."
2,"Concept good, reliability bad","I was so excited when I found this music stand. It was sturdier than those thin metal folding stands. It was compact when folded up and easy to carry. It was easy to set up. But I've had problems with this stand and am now shopping for another one to replace it.First, one of the legs was too loose. It slid out each time I moved the stand (and in my flute choir, we move around a lot during performances, so this was not good). So I had my handy husband alter the leg and it was better than new. But then, after a performance one night, I heard a snap as I was putting it away. One of the pieces that the legs fit into cracked - and not one that was holding the ""altered piece"". After many hours of super glue and tape repairs, I'm giving up on this. We fix the piece only to have it snap again.My recommendation is this stand is not good for frequent use."
2,Not very sturdy stand,I have had this stand for 10 years. I use it if I don't have a lot of weight on the stand. It is flimsy and easily tipped. I've had to spray WD 40 on the joints cause they get stuck every now and then.
1,Broke first time....,"Broke the first time I used it. Cost me $12.00 to send it back. Flimsy product, also difficult to assemble."
1,Don't bother,"If you want to read some good books on the Viet Nam War, try Run between the Raindrops, The Battle of Hue, Operation Ripcord, or anything else. This book was not worth the money I wasted on it. It seems as if Mr. Helms gathered all his letters from his service and just included lines from them. There was very little dialog (memory may have failed him). I am not criticizing his service to this great nation, nor would I ever to presume to tell him how to write a book, but I would not recommend this book."
4,Well Designed,"I bought this to illuminate the keyboard on my 12"" Apple Powerbook when I work in the dark. It works well, and shines impressively bright and wide. I even use it to read by simply sitting it on its back on my lap as I read in bed and pointing the lamp at my book. It's too bad the lamp's arm isn't telescopic or it'd make for a perfectly good clip-on booklight right out of the box.This device is well built, folds into a form that protects it from damage, even when thrown in a laptop case full of stuff that might crush something built less solidly. And it has a nice retracting USB cable. The retraction device for the cable, like most I've seen on devices like this, can be a bit finnicky but with the right pulling technique works correctly about 90% of the time.Update, May, 2005. The light died. No idea why. So, maybe it's not as good as I thought. :)"
2,BEWARE: Three movies with same and similar title,"This one was produced in 1998 and stars Jeff Rector. Basically an FBI agent finds that vampires are killing people--then add gore and juvenile acting.NIGHTFALL (1988) was based on Isaac Asimov's book and stars David Birney, Sarah Douglas, Alexis Kanner--good sci fi. ISAAC ASIMOV'S NIGHTFALL ( 2000 starring David Carradine) is recent version, better version of same novel adaptation. In my opinion, LOOK for either one of those, not this dud."
2,A brief comment,"This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I haven't seen Ed Wood's Plan Nine from Outer Space, so maybe it's just the second worst movie ever made, but anyway, it's up there. The actors looked like they rounded up a group of homeless people and gave them some acting lessons. The acting was poor, the dialog was worse, the sets were hoky, and the overall implementation of Asimov's concept was atrocious. Even the audience was laughing derisively at how bad it was after the first half hour of the flick. I give it two stars just for effort since it's at least based on the Asimov story and perhaps their heart was in the right place, but otherwise it would rate one star. Possibly worth seeing if you've seen the Ed Wood movie just to see if this one is actually worse."
4,This Film has GROUND ZERO's Clyde Lewis in Cameo,"I remember hearing about this movie on Ground Zero. Clyde Lewis the guy who co wrote the script,plays the baggage guy who smokes the cigar and swears like a truck driver. His head exploding in the small scene in front of the Creamation place was a masterpiece of horror. In fact You wouldn't recognize him without his beard and black clothing. Adam Smoot is really good. He had a Cameo in the Movie Clay Pidgeons. Rector over acts in this Movie but he was okay on NYPD blue with his brother Jerry. I like NIGHTFALL not because it's a blockbuster but because of it's cult potential."
3,Truly Heroic Effort by the Reader,"This was the author's first published novel and has a whole lot of flaws that range from too much swearing (and I don't mean from a moral standpoint but a prose standpoint, I got really tired of hearing about some diety's ""balls"") to huge chunks of exposition thinly disguised as conversation. Then there is the ultimate sin, being told that the action in a long section of the story was unnecessary, just sort of a character building exercise. Oh, someone or other's balls! It wasn't even an interesting long section of the story for the most part.However, I just bought another book read by Raymond Todd because he gave this one such a heroic effort. Really. Faced with a made up language, long tongue twisting names and some embassassing prose he soldiered on valiantly. This man is a professional.So if you like pseudo medieval fantasy with a bit of cross dressing and in need of some pruning shears give this one a shot."
5,A black child's perspective of life in the 60s,"This book is one of the best books that I have read in a while. It is written from the perspective of a black boy growing up without a father in Maine. Mitchell, the boy, grows up as you are reading but you continue to see his life experiences from the original eyes that you came to know at the very beginning of the book when Mitchell is only seven years old. The rest of everything that happens to him and that he experiences is painted by his experiences as a child. Mitchell, like all of us, carries the baggage of his culture, his family and his myths with him throughout his teenage life and adulthood. This book is so well written and so beautifully chronicled that I cannot imagine anyone not loving it."
4,Best Blondie Live Gig EVER!,"This is a short but very exceting live gig from Blondie, Deborah at her very very best."
4,fairly good,"for those whom expected to hear the tunes of thetraditional flamenco music, please take a few minutesand listen to thesamples before you confirm your purchase.this CD adds a new blend to the concept of flamenco, nottypically my type, but it is worth listening, speciallythe 1st and 8th track, that is, ""Tres Notas Para Decir TeQuiero"" and ""Bolero de Vicente""."
4,easy rumba,"Music, like movies, should be evaluated on the basis of their intent... Vicente Amigo has come out with a very good collection of romantic rumba background music, a kind of flamenco lite. He's an excellent guitarist, and he has succeeded. Any serious musicologists (or wannabes) who compare this with Sabicas or ""pure"" flamenco (whatever that is) are barking up the wrong tree. By the way, the ""real"" gypsies I know listen to Cher, Prince, and Mexican hiphop, along with all the rumberos on the radio. Sabicas, Camaron, and Elvis are wonderful, but they are dead. So, wake up and smell the jasmine."
4,not that bad!,"I thought this cd had a great collection of new age music. I wouldn't say it is classic flamenco, but the tunes were calming, inspiring and worth listening to!Similar to some Govi stuff I have."
2,Corny,"I own several flamenco CDs, and ""Ciudad de las Ideas"" has to be the one I listen to the least. ""La Tarde es Caramelo"" and ""Ojos de la Alhambra"" are the only songs on this CD worth listening to. The rest of this CD is painfully corny and boring-- especially the first track, the last track, and the title track. I like Vicente Amigo, but this is his worst album. Most of the songs just don't have the hearty essence of real flamenco. For some good, innovative flamenco, I highly recommend the music of Gerardo Nunez and the albums ""Jucal"", ""Calima"", ""Andando el Tiempo"", and ""La Nueva Escuela de la Guitarra Flamenca."""
2,"""%""$","relative to his fist cd 'de mi corazan al aire' this is not in the same sublime light; but this is very good music non the less. it lack the original spontaneous sound that i know he is capable of, of which there are wispy hints. its as if he is trying to play, instead of letting it FLOW; a delicate art. i hope he returnith to the melodic spontaneous sound that places him right at the top of his art in a realm of his own. my star rating is more based on his own potential rather than comparing it to that of other artists."
2,Modern Flamenco,"This artist has gone too far away from what flamenco is. If you want to listen to Real flamenco there is Camaron and Jose Merce.If he is intending to call his music new flamenco, there are far better artists in doing that.Try Gipsy Kings, Ketama, and NovaMeno."
5,Fabulous CD,"This CD is an ecstatic glorious combination of East mysticism and Western vibes. The distinct unique sound of Indian instruments weaved with Western guitar and rock sound makes me want to get up and dance, shout with pure joy, every time I play this CD, which is everyday.I am also a belly dancer and have created dance routines just for this CD. Everywhere I have played Anant's music people have fallen in love with this extraordinary sound. I played this for a Hindu friend of mine and he immediately fell into the rhythm and mood this CD invokes and bought CD's for his family.I cannot say enough about this Anant Jesse's music, it is exuberant, delightful, dynamic, eclectic. Highly recommended. I hope that Anant is soon back in the studio, I am waiting."
5,Best study ever,If you study the Bible and find it hard to understand and confusing this Book goes a long way in explaning why the Bible is so misunderstood. This book gives insight that is compelling and demands consideration. The most worthwhile study I have ever read.
3,"Not much from Dennis Miller, but OK","This is a taped show of the Young Comedian's floorshow with Dennis Miller as host. He cracks a few introductory jokes and then the stage belongs to the other comedians, who are similar in style and funny all over. Just don't mistake this for a Miller-Video and you'll have fun."
4,"A nice mix of rock & folk, live & ""produced.""","There are some new songs here and sufficient differences in the songs that Ashley has recorded before to justify buying this CD. If you are new to Ashley, this would be a good buy--there's high energy in this one--though her Grammy-winning ""Lesson of Love"" still stands as tops. This live album has no long ""chat"" pieces, so it stands up to replays well."
5,Worked well,"Worked fine, cut easily and completely. Cookies were completely formed. The top part near the candle cut fine as well."
1,Very disappointed in this coffee urn,"We purchased 3 of these coffee urns for our school Parent Guild about 4 years ago and have been disappointed ever since. We ordered them because they were a good price for a stainless steel urn vs. aluminum. However, they have NEVER brewed really hot coffee or hot water. You can actually stick your finger into the coffee just after pouring and you won't get burned!! Also, the Glass Coffee Cup Level Gauge broke on one of our urns and we haven't been able to find a replacement. We are considering getting rid of all 3 urns and buying something else. Don't get these ... you'd be better off with a plain old aluminum Westbend!"
4,Beautiful but somewhat complicated,"Being a master at putting together IKEA furniture, I thought that purchasing the kit for this music stand would work out fine. Warning: this is a whole, 'nother order of assembly! It requires some basic woodworking skills and tools, neither of which I possessed. With a little help from a friend, though, I was able to assemble, oil, and wax the stand. Completed, it is really beautiful. It doesn't adjust quite as low as the metal music stands do, so someone playing from a chair might want to check the height. But it is a gorgeous small piece of furniture, with graceful, simple lines and elegant presence."
3,A little light on content,"I went into this hoping for images of the stores, advertising, layouts - across time. While there is some of that, quite a bit is taken up with images of individuals who were part of the story, people at dinners and events where official pictures would be taken. There are even a few family get-togethers! They're only good if it's *your* family.I was really hoping for more of a focus on the stores themselves, their products, and the ephemera associated with it. This one isn't a purchase - see if your library has a copy to flip through."
2,This book was very poorly written...,"I am sorry to say that this book was most assuredly the worst book concerning tactics for getting started in real estate that I have read. It was full of spelling errors, grammatical errors, and typo errors. This should never happen in a published work. One gets the feeling after having read the first two to three chapters that the author simply wrote down as much as he could remember and then hurridly put the book out for sale at 22.00 bucks a pop. The author also has the annoying habit of using exclamation points where they are not needed!The author, after the first parts of the book, resorts to giving the reader terms of the business. Fantastic. I think we can all find out what those terms mean without having to buy this book.Save your money and look elsewhere. This book is not worth it."
2,"A ""Just OK"" starter book","Although there is usable, valuable information in this book, overall it's just OK. There are a lot of errors that should have been caught. That lack of attention to detail in a listing or sales contract could land you in court.There was also some padding to make the book bigger. When the author tells you to make a list to compare brokerages, he includes the list three times so you can compare three brokers!My guess is, that in the future, the author will write a better, more in depth book about real estate. He knows the business and has been very successful. In the meantime, ""Your First Year in Real Estate,"" by Dirk Zeller, is a better introduction to the profession."
1,No Substance Here,"I just finished reading this book and am very disappointed in the lack of content. I wouldn't even recommend this book for someone new to real estate (as I am). It contains sections on prospecting, assisting buyers, assisting sellers, etc, but does not give you any good information in these sections. It basically tells you all sorts of things that you should think about when it comes to prospecting, buying, and selling, which most likely is what you are already thinking about and were hoping to find answers to in this book. Unfortunately there are no answers here. Save your money, there are much better books out there (for example Danielle Kennedy's ""How to List and Sell Real Estate"" provides much more content and gives advice on how to DO things and not just what to think about)."
4,Bookviews.com Review,"If you're thinking of starting a career in real estate, pick up a copy of Mark Nash's Starting & Succeeding in Real Estate... Nash is the founder of the Training Institute, LLC, in Illinois that provides state-approved pre-license real estate education, so he knows whereof he speaks. As he points out, the Internet has transformed how real estate is bought and sold these days when people have access to information that formerly was held by the real estate firms. How one can effectively use the Internet is the key for future real estate agents. For the beginner, this book will no doubt prove very helpful"
1,He needs a proof reader,"I have read many many books in my 40 years, and I have NEVER seen such an EMBARRASSING collection of misspellings and poor punctuation in any book, even those which were self-published. A run through a basic spell checker was obviuosly never done, and author has very poor grammar skills indeed, not knowing the prover use of their vs. there.Its hard to take someone's advice seriously when their writing skills are so very very bad. I would be embarrassed to release this book."
2,Mark Nash's Real Estate book,"Frustrating to read, due to all of the grammatical errors. It gives you the feeling that most of the it was transcribed from illegible notes made on a stack of napkins, or directly from a voice recording made while driving a car. Maybe with better editing the next edition will be worthwhile, though most of the content seemed pretty basic (though, I'll admit, I'm no real estate pro). Right now, I would invest my book dollars elsewhere."
4,The only way to purchase this on CD!,"We children of the 70's remember this CD well. I personally have been looking to replace my 8-track version for years. While not released in the U.S., this Japanese import is currently the only way to buy this album on CD. While the liner notes are in Japanese, the lyrics are also offered in English.What matters, however, is the music! Hearing these old songs again, ""Nights are Forever"" and ""I'd Really Love to See You Tonight"" being the hit singles, just filled me with joy. The other songs, ""Prisoner"", ""Showboat Gambler"", and all the rest are really superb, mellow pop-rock songs. I was amazed that I still remembered most of the words, and all of the feelings came flooding back.For those who have been awaiting release on CD - this version is well worth it! (One star reduction for the Japanese liner notes and jewelbox spine text)."
4,Got the job done.,"I ordered this dress for my 4 year old daughter. It was not as cute in person, but cute enough. The description from one store said tiara included, but the description from the store I ordered the costume from said tiara sold separately. I bought a tiara from another store, only to find a cheap, broken tiara in the package when the costume was delivered. Overall, the costume worked out for us, and the shopping was easy. I just wish the description was a bit clearer."
3,Worth watching.,"As the title suggests, Sammo once again shows the self-mockery that he's well known for. Naturally, this is part of his enormous charm. Unlike Hollywood's representation of the hero - who more often than not is handsome and nearly always gets the girl - , 80's Hong Kong cinema usually featured a hero with not much going for him and that wonderful innocence that has sadly gone. In 'Enter The Fat Dragon', Sammo is naivity personified, but is also blessed with extraordinary skill; his scene with the nunchukas is worth the price on it's own. The poor quality of the Dvd and the lack of remastered subtitles hinder the marks for this film, but if you want to see the real Sammo (not the watered-down Martial Law one), check this excellent cult-classic out"
4,Some of Samo best stuff............or Bruce's,This movie is really a good movie.....once you get through all the comedy.Like an obviously Chinese guy acting like he is a black guy....like they couldn't hire Jim Kelly to play the part.The action is still really good.Samo is a good Bruce Lee inpersonator.He may not look like Bruce but you can see and feel he is a good fighter in his own rite.All those whose who are true martial artists will see that this is a good movie and even worth paying for.
2,Mikey is the best but overall I'm disappointed,My son got this toy along with the other three for his fourth birthday. We like Mikey the best but they were overall a disappointment. They go terribly slow although Mikey is the fastest ( they all go different speeds ) They do nothing more then roll straight across the floor. By the commercial we thought they did a lot more. They make no noise nor do their arms or weapons move that is all manually which is hard to do when they are rolling across the floor they'll fall down. He likes them but it was not all that he thought they would be.
2,get back on the cross...there's no fire here,"On Get Off The Cross, Firewater sounded like a Tom Waits, Pogues, Nick Cave cover band doing original tunes. It was absolutely wonderful, a 5-star affair. I couldn't wait to get my hands on the follow-up. The wait went for naught. This was a monumental let down after the magic and moodiness of Get Off The Cross. Ponzi has few, if any, stand out tracks. Firewater was a real cool band that seemed to ruin the effect once they realized how cool they were. Grab a copy of Get Off The Cross...We Need The Wood For The Fire before you purchase this lesser effort."
2,2 Songs! that's it!,"On this entire Cd there were only 2 really good songs. The best having to be, "" So long Superman"". THis song was extremely good but it alone wasn't worth the money."
4,They Might be Giants + Noir,"This is definitely not your everyday music. It's in the same zip-code as They Might Be Giants, but several shades darker. While listening to some of these songs I felt as though I were embroiled in some '40s detective novel. Some of their punchlines in songs like ""Droppin' Like Flies"" and ""Green Light"" just gave me that feeling. It's almost like listening to an entire CD of songs in the same vein as Elvis Costello's ""Watchin' the Detectives."" Another thing that sets them apart from their peers is their texture. The regular use of varied instruments helps keep your attention. You don't feel like they're just grinding it out. If you're looking for something more inventive and entertaining, this is for you."
1,Whoa!....Wait just a minute! This set is 2X the price of individual ones....almost!,"Order each CD individually, please! This doesn't make economic sense. Don't go blindly down the path of Amazon. This price must have been concocted prior to the agent having his/her morning coffee! Only as long as this ""Gold Box"" deal lasts today is this particular deal even worth considering."
2,Over priced,I own the first CD and bought it when it came out. I don't remember what I paid for it but I know this price in gold box is just crazy. You can pick up any or all of these CD's just about everywhere this time of year.I like the CD I have becuase it (at the time) put a new sound to Christmas Music. The one main reason I did buy the CD is Bob Seger is on there with his version of Little Drummer Boy. Bob Seger is my favorite singer and I just wanted the CD for one song.I really like Madonna's music but when I hear her sing Santa Baby I just want to scream. She sounds like a really bad Betty Boop.Listen to the samples of the songs and buy the CD's you like at the dollar store or Walmart..... for less money.
1,A Total Ripoff...,"If they can repackage and sell these for $90, I'm going become a seller and hawk my Hall and Oates LPs"
1,Are You Kidding?,Don't even consider buying this. How can Amazon post such a non gold box price? We the consumer aren't dumb. I thought economic downturn meant businesses would put their best wares forward at a discount to entice the consumer into buying. All i've seen at a lot of places is garage sale garbage at a Macy's price. Get with the program please!
1,la musique,A fun cd. Having read Cutting For Stone and being the presenter for our local book group I wanted to hear the national anthem that was mentioned so prominently in the book. It's played in several different versions here and the music is absolutely contagious. Wish I would order more ethiopian music.
2,They broke!,I was disappointed because they broke! One of the posts broke away from the base and now I can't wear them.
1,Not worth the money,"This isn't even a book. I may be wrong, but it looks like a bunch of photocopies bounded with spiral bound. The contents of the packet are basically the same thing you would get from the Immigration and Naturalization Service if you call them and request a naturalization package. And if you get it from the INS it's free. There's also a tape that comes with the packet that could help people who don't understand English very well practice what the interview would be like. This is probably the most valuable item in the packet. It would be useful for someone who can't get anyone to read them the questions in English. I recommend instead (if your first language is Spanish) Carlos F. Paz's Practica para el Examen de Ciudadania (available at Amazon). It's a real book, with more content than this one, and it costs four times less."
5,"Comments from Marguerite D. Cordice-Bayley, Esq.","I have seen some of the packages produced by the American Immigration Center and they are quite well done, very self explanatory, the writing is easy to understand and the instructions are easy to follow, you are also prompted to seek legal advice if you need it."""
5,"If you don't dig this CD, you'd better check your pulse","Kumi's voice is infectiously fresh and arresting, Naoki's guitar relentlessly driving. All kinds of (chiefly North American) influences are strongly present here: indie, country, straight-ahead rock, Cal-Mex, Morissette angst, hints of Grace Slick and early Airplane. But far from being simply a talented pastiche (a charge always unfairly leveled at Japanese groups), it stirs all of these elements together into a brilliant, dream-like evocation of youthful, danceable, and---yes---sexual, energy. Love Pychedelico's seamless mixture of English and Japanese lyrics adds to the mesmeric force of the music. Get this CD, you won't be disappointed."
3,Great Idea but needs to be more durable.,"My 6 yr. old twins were very excited to receive this for their birthday and get to decorate their room. It was a great tool to use to have a discussion about the planets as we blew them up. (Which took about 1/2 hr using the included foot pump). I appreciated the included booklet for additional information about the planets, but only wish it was a little bit more kid friendly. After we took time to blow them up and then hang them, it was only a few hours later that three of them lost air. Needless to say, despite the fact that they come with patches for fixing them, I wasn't happy to have to do this just after receiving them. Overall a nice toy idea, but a little dissapointed with the lack of sturdyness. - Victoria"
1,Great idea. Poor quality.,"The pump is essentially worthless. It took less time to blow them up manually. The small planets are very misshapen. The shape is more like that of a lemon than a sphere. All but 2 did not hold air more than a day or two. Saturn looks like it has pieces of shoddy, plastic-encased scaffolding hanging off of it. Very disappointing."
1,neptune had a hole in it and won't hold air,the product is every colorful and easy to use. The quality of workmanship in not so hot.
2,Great Idea with Poor Design,"Pump is a joke. I used my electric air pump or else this would have taken hours to inflate. Even so, the whole process took approximatley 4-5 hours (including repairing Saturn with worthless patches provided). Saturn is poorly designed and had a tear hole at the point where the rings connect to the planet (a hole and this is discovered the first time we inflated it)! The smell of the plastic is so strong in the room we have to keep the door open and ventilate it during the day. If the smell does not disappear I am repacking the product and returning it for refund. I recall the scandal last year in China for using toxic paint in toys. Who knows if these Chinese manufactured products were or were not involved in that disaster. I do intend to call the manufacturer today and request a replacement Saturn. I don't expect much, but I will give it a try. A great concept, but poorly produced."
5,Awesome for a Classroom,"I absolutely love this product! I am currently a student teacher and even though I haven't used this with actual children, all my friends want this product for their future classrooms. I used it for one of my science lesson plan presentations which requires my classmates to act like 5th graders. They loved manipulating the planets and putting them in the right order. However, I cannot wait to teach the solar system to my future students and hang the planets from the ceiling. I love that this product was made to be able to hang them up. The Sun is absolutely HUGE! It took the longest to blow up. This product is much like a beach ball and after some time air will escape them so you may have to re-pump which is something I have already done with the sun but it wasn't horribly bad or deformed it just was kind soft.I know this review is pretty much random facts or thought but I'm just so excited about and I want you to know what to expect.Love this product! Highly recommend it!"
5,ceiling,We hung them from the ceiling and it is great. We gaze at the planets during story time and it is all good.
2,Far below expectations,"The planets do not form a toy perfect sphere. In the case of the Moon, Mercury and Pluto, the prints are largely absent from the surface and are all nearly equal (blank). Saturn's rings are heavy and give the impression of being a hat that ring. The idea for inflatable solar system is good, but that, specifically, is very poor. Keep them hanging because my 3 year old son is very picky about those details that he does not know ... (translated from Portuguese by Google Translate)."
3,This is cute for a young astronomer.,"I gave this to my six year old grandson who is really into the Solar System. He likes it but he did say to me ""The size of the planets is not right. Earth is way smaller than Jupiter and way, way smaller than the Sun, but it doesn't look like that here."" If a six-year-old can determine that the inflatable model is not to scale... So take that part of it with a grain of salt.Another thought is think about where you are going to hang this. My daughter has tall ceilings in her home. For them the display is fine. This is going to be hanging very low in a house with only 8' high ceilings. They also hung them along one wall because the room has a ceiling fan in it that gets used. Other than that, it's cute."
5,Incredible planets!,"This looks great hanging from the ceiling in my son's room. We also got an extra mercury (so we are pretending it's Pluto's moon). The only thing about this is the smell when first opening it. It took about a week of airing these out in the garage to get that rubber smell out enough to hang. Then it took a few more days in the bedroom to finally have the smell go away. We knew this from other ratings though, so we were prepared for it. The sun is huge! And I found the ""average"" sizes to be accurate as described."
1,Poca calidad,Este producto es uno de poca calidad para el precio q tiene. El olor al plastico es desagradable los dos globos mas prqueños vinieron defectuosos con rotos. En fin perdi mi dinero y mi sobrino quedo algo triste ya q dos de los globos vinieron rotos y el olor tan fuerte al plastico le causo alergias.
2,Very Cool,"My children are very love it. I have just one bad feeling , and this bad feeling is the ring of Saturn. Hmmm.... This ring not looks like a rint at all. Maybe that help if the ring can be also inflateble.If you can step over the ring of saturn problem, you can enjoy this merchandise."
3,Decent,"This set is decent for the price, however, I was disappointed that Saturn's rings were flimsy (as others had indicated) and also, Saturn would not stay inflated."
2,SAD SAX: BEYOND BLUNDERDOME...,"In the future (2019 to be exact), the world is destroyed by nuclear holocaust. This causes a gang of dirt-bike / golfcart-riding derelicts in cute white outfits to roam the land in search of other survivors to run down in painfully slooow chase sequences. Enter Scorpion (George Eastman) in his 1970s model sportscar w/ dryer-duct hoses sticking out of it, and a big plastic bubble mounted on the roof! Man, that's the very definition of cool! He's out to rid the planet of the guys in the groovy white costumes. Fred Williamson stars as Nadir, the wandering archer of the wasteland. His humongous moustache and exploding arrows aid Scorpion in his quest to save what's left of the world. Watch for the gut-bustingly hilarious decapitation and exploding body scenes! You'll be howling and rewinding all night! Oh my! ..."
3,Italian movie makers meet Mad Max,"Warriors of the Wasteland has to be one of the number one picks for a bad movie night. Chips, dip, margaritas, and a few of your best friends and you can have a howling good time. Movies depicting ""the end of the world as we know it"" nearly always have near naked women, strong heroes, and crazy villains. Don't forget the really strange cars and killing devices.This one almost had a plot, borrowed from the Mel Gibson film, Mad Max II (Road Warrior). WOW does have its fun moments. Fred Williamson as Nadir, a wildly uniformed archer, is fun to watch. The female lead, whose lines number maybe three, is a beauty for the guys. The lead, Scorpion, is handsome. And the little boy with the ability to fix almost any automobile is a charmer, even as he uses a slingshot to kill one of the Templars, the villains who are intent on killing every living thing on earth.If you decide to watch this film, don't expect much, except for a lot of laughs. Have another margarita."
1,"good try, but I don't think so","This movie is obvously a spin off from the Mad Max movies. It's LOW budget like the first Mad Max, but horribly written. The fight scenes are not believable at all. The bad guys are supposed to be roving homosexuals, but again Not believable.In short I think that while Mad Max is a good movie to try to copy, not by whoever wrote this. I bought it so the writers won."
2,Good concepts but outdated.,"I had to write this review because there were nothing but glowing reviews when I purchased the book. This book is OLD. I think it was written in 1977 and it reads that way. The author uses a lot of hippie terminology. It just gave me the feeling that it was really out of date. I am admittedly a self-help book junkie, so I feel embarrassingly qualified to review the thing. A lot of his concepts seem ""new age"". Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with that, it's just that over the last few decades writers seem to have become more and more adept at sharing this kind of knowledge without sounding hokey. Do your self a favor, buy something written in the last couple years. If there are any ideas worth keeping, rest assured, your favorite contemporary author has borrowed it and made it easier to understand."
5,outstanding contribution to the field of human rights,"I was honored to write the foreword for this outstanding book. This book takes us beyond social justice into the arena of human rights. Issues relating to vulnerable populations including women, children, disabled persons, racial and ethnic minorities, and gays and lesbians are magnificently covered within a human rights context. This volume effectively brings social work into the 21st Century!"
2,Boring sequel,"I read this the other day and I wasn't so impressed! It was boring, confusing and bloated.The Story is that Cole's friend Jason's brother is missing. They search the whole Philadelphia for him, but he's nowhere to be found. Until he meets Brenda, He must unravel the brother's escape from home.Unless you are a Die-Hard 6th sense fan, there is very little reason to buy or read this book. Boooooring."
5,great,its just as i remembered it outstanding cd. too bad after the 2nd cd they went pop this band had alot of potential.great cd
5,SSSoooooo underated!!,One of the best albums by an underated band!!!Akira's tone is so awesome on this!!BUY!!BUY!!BUY!!
2,Japanese pop metal,"This 1985 album was the first real breakthrough for Loudness in America. It was a total gamble. So, producer Max Norman (as he always did in those times) made them change their sound and become ""hair-metal"" - with all the package: make-up, outrageous clothing, reverb drums, etc, etc. THe final result was not a bad album at all, but, at its best, it sounds like just a pedestrian metal album filled with weak pop metal songs who serve only one purpose: make room for the magnificent solos of Akira Takasaki, a genial guitarist with feeling and melody. It's a shame that LOUDNESS sold out, but, hey, they were only listening to their managers..."
4,GOOD GUITAR WORK,"ESTE ALBUM MUESTRA UN POCO DE REMINISCENCIAS DE OZZY PERO CON UN PODER EN LA GUITARRA QUE SE NOTA DEPURADO POR PARTE DE TAKASAKI.RIFFS PODEROSOS ,COROS MELODICOS Y PODER EN LA VOZ.ALTAMENTE RECOMENDADO PARA LOS SEGUIDORES DE ESTE GRUPO"
5,These guys can PLAY!,"Loudness was unfairly lumped in with all the '80s so-called ""hair-metal"" bands because of their look (probably due more to mis-management than actual personal styles), and unfortunately that label seemed to have stuck with them, despite the release of 4 brilliant CDs, this one being the first Major Label American release. Led by the ""Oh yeah Yngwie? Check THIS out!"" guitar work of Akira Takasaki, Loudness was a band of guys who could PLAY, not pose. Yes, the lyrics are fairly simple and sometimes juvenile, but I don't remember anyone else writing anything considered prose at the time either. Especially if you are a guitar player, this CD is a must have. Try to see whether or not you can match up with the straight picked solo in ""Clockwork Toy"" and then call this mediocre. I don't think so."
5,Great Chicken Fryer,It is preseasoned just like described. My food does not stick in the skillet. Browns food great. I love my new skillet. i recommend buying this for your own kitchen.
5,Lodge 5Q chicken Fryer!,"Nice fryer! Toughest part is convincing my wife to not wash it, she's getting there! Thanks, she loves it and so do I!"
5,Great pan for some serious cooking.,This cast iron pan is a great size for some serious cooking. I love good cookware and this pan did not disappoint me. It is heavy and a really nice depth.
4,pretty good,"I like the pot but it does start to rust very fast, my solution was to cook it some more in the oven and it was fine."
5,Simply amazing,"Being the proud owner of several other Lodge cooking vessels, I boldly tried my hand at frying. All I can say is wow.The chicken fryer works wonders on chicken, veal, and cube steak. All of the cast iron properties come in to play when using the fryer, and it provides the control and the stability needed when frying foods. The heavy weight gives it stability, and the heat retention properties mean that you can control your cooking efforts more efficiently.Try the fryer, you won't be disapointed!"
5,This is the ONE!!!,"If I had but one pot on a desert Island this is the one. I bought this chicken fryer (pot) for my grown, married with kids, daughter for Christmas. It has become her ""everything"" pot. I has not left the stove top in over a month! It is heavy and does not move when she puts items in or takes them out - making it a safe pot. It heats evenly - making it a good fryer. It has a lid - making it a good stew pot or good for those Ox tails she likes to cook (I don't eat them personally). It is a rough and tumble pot with a surface she can abuse with her metal utensils - unlike my much more expensive non-stick surfaced pans I won't let her touch. In short she love this item and I am ever so glad I bought it for her."
5,Long car ride anyone?,"My kids love Dr. Seuss, I love not having to read to them in the car! Great for trips when you just can't take another row row row your boat. These are all read by actors that Mom and Dad know so it's great for us to hear them reading childrens books."
4,Wonderful,"My kids loved listening to these audio books as toddlers. We generally played it on their bedroom stereos and the background music didn't seem to take away from the narration. Now that I know what I know about Kelsey Grammer, I guess I wish we'd gotten the Dustin Hoffman or John Lithgow version, haha, but ce las vie, I guess. Always a classic!"
2,Boring. Disappointing. Only 1 good track - Cat in the Hat,"Strengths: The 1st track has Kelsey Grammar narrating Cat in the Hat. Kelsey does and EXCELLENT job! So your expectations are high for the CD.Weaknesses: After track #1, it is downhill from there. The rest of the tracks are boring.My kids (who are 6 and under) love listening to books on audio CD. However, my kids started tuning out the CD after track #2. I have tried playing during quiet time and in the car. I found the CD unbearable to listen to especially in the car because it is boring and makes mom sleepy. Save your money.Suggestion: If you can buy the MP3 of Cat in the Hat with Kelsey Grammar or purchase the the audio CD for ""Green Eggs and Ham"". The Green Eggs CD is excellent and you stay awake."
1,Churches Duped by Green Extremists by Henry Lamb,"Churches Duped by Green Extremists [article]by Henry LambHenry Lamb is the executive VP of the Environmental Conservation Organizationand chairman of Sovereignty International.[...]Few, if any, of the churches realize that the National Religious Partnership for the Environment is the outgrowth of extreme ecologists who believe the Bible is obsolete, that the earth - gaia - is the giver of life, that human beings are but individual cells in the gaia organism, and that the United Nations is the evolving ""brain"" of gaia."
1,A pathetic book from the 60's.,George Will reviewed this book and said that it was the worst book ever written. He was right. If you want to understand the insanity of that period just read this book. Reich was convinced that bell bottom jeans made one incapable of taking himself seriously and was transforming the nation.There is a factual mistake on every page of this book. It is difficult to immagine how the author became a professor at the Yale University Law School.
1,I've read this book.,I've read Reich's book and I do not think he had one original idea in the whole book. It was a waste of printer's ink.
5,Worthy Successor...,"It was a pleasant surprise to discover this book. Its description reminded me of Martin Gardner's Fantasia Mathematica and its sequel, The Mathematical Magpie. In fact that is exactly, deliciously, what William Frucht has given us. In an afterward, he tells how he begged Gardner to put together a new mathematical fantasia. Gardner finally suggests that Frucht put it together himself! Gardner's original anthology is one of my favorite anthologies of all time, and Frucht's successor is satisfyingly worthy. Three cheers for Frucht! Now if only there were sequels to the sequels...one sequel in the first square of a giant chessboard, two in the second, four in the third, eight in the fourth...ah, yes...what a beautiful thought, albeit a tad mite greedy...but like Stanislaw Lem's theoretical dragons, maybe the theoretical sequels to the sequels could sometimes be partially real..."
5,Best intro reference for graduate students,"This is by far the best graduate text for basic probability and statistics that is currently made. It even nicely incorporates Bayesian material in a completely relevant way. No, it is probably too complex and abstract for complete beginners in probability as many of the reviewers here have suggested. For anyone with even just a basic background in statistics or probability, however, it is perfect. It is straightforward, comprehensive and most importantly highly readable. There is no comparison to other probability/statistics texts I own--if you are pursuing any sort of graduate level study in statistics or basic probability this the textbook to own and reference."
1,Awfully Structured,This book has far too many dependencies between chapters and sections. The authors keep making forward and backward references that make the book needlessly complicated.
2,Have to do previous exercises,"Is the same version as the hardcover even though it is a different picture. The book is always referring back to exercises in previous chapters for explaining topics in later chapters, but if you didn't do the exercise or don't know how to do the exercise then you are stuck!"
5,Good,"Its a really good book for starters, especially with a weak background in math.. it may be little too exhaustive but overall I think its a good deal!!!"
2,Good Book ? Yes....For Self Study? NOOOOO !!,"I am doing a self study and do not have any facility to get help of any instructor. I purchased the book after got good reference from some of my friends. The content of the book is pretty good...BUT when it comes to the problems...there are a very very few worked out examples (as usual they are the easiest ones)...Addition to that the publisher decided to earn every bits of pennies. So they created a Student's solution manual. No where in the publisher's site anything mentioned about the manual. But when I purchased , found that the manual has solution for ONLY Odd numbered solution (for them the answers are given in the original book). I was wondering whether they have another solution manual for EVEN numbered problems...!!!The instructor's manual is out of stock and you cannot download it from the publisher's site (unless you are an Instructor which I am not).Now I am wondering how I can get help on the even numbered problems....any idea???"
2,Too much theory,Relevant material is buried underneath too much theory. Not enough examples. I bought this book to supplement another book to and I had to buy another one to supplement this one.
5,Shipped fast,The book I orderd came very quickly and was wrapped a lot yo prevent damage. I am really pleased that the book was well taken care off and was in fact brand new and undamaged.
4,Intuitive and inspirative...,"I think this book is written in a very comprehensive way. But there may be someone who feels tired of too big kindness shown by the author. The chapter on special distributions is outstanding, especially. It is a good training to utilize basic probabilistical ideas while solving inspirative problems contained in this book, isn't it?"
2,"Excellent Book, Not in Good Condition","It's very good book in Probability and Statistics, a must-have for any researcher.Book's Condition is bad. There're 2 pages severely scratched."
1,Same old slop,When the smoke cleared it was obvious that these guys didn't have an original bone in their body. Very predictable. No edge. R&b sugar pop! Based on that they should do O.K. for themselves.
4,TOUCHING IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE!,"""FurryFeatherySoftSleekLove All critters!""-- Critter Love (back cover)When I picked Critter Love up, the first thing I noticed was the fuzzy feeling of the hippo on the cover. As I read through the easy reading, attractive book I notice there were more fuzzy feeling creatures. What an attention-grabbing effect for the kids to enjoy as they gaze at the home-style illustrations.Critter Love is a book that tells kids to be kind to critters. No matter what kind--wild and tame--or what size--big or little. There are drawings of elephants, alligators, giraffes, turtles, sheep, dogs, cats and even a porpoise or two.I'm not sure if the author meant it to be, but this is an entertaining tool for the youngest school-aged child in the family. With the colorful illustrations and simple wording, it teaches them at a young age to respect animals. The pages are thick for easy handling and extra wide to hold the fun illustrations."
5,The best electro-soul album of the last 25 years?!,"I bought this on vinyl when it first came out in 1982/93, and let me tell you, nothing has ever equalled it for sheer force, drive, and sexiness - the first four cuts, including the title track, the addictive should-have-been-bigger-hit YOU ARE IN THE SYSTEM, IT'S PASSION, and STAND UP AND CHEER are peerless elecro-soul of the 80s kind, when they really did sound years ahead of their time - and still do. I cannot fathom why this CD has been out of print for more than decades, while so much dreck gets reissued on CD, but I am really glad I have mine. Wounded Bird reissued their second and third albums last year, why not this one?"
4,David Frank & Mic Murphy Funk,"Sweat [Bonus Tracks] (1983)1. Sweat2. You Are In My System (5 Stars)3. It's Passion (4 Stars)4. Stand Up And Cheer5. I Won't Let Go6. Go For What You Know7.

With the bonus tracks, takes this CD to another level. Fabulous extended tracks!"
2,"Close, but no cigar.","I used this book in my beginning AutoCAD LT 2000 technical drawing course. I liked the approach, topics covered, and drawing exercises. However, mistakes were abound. I ended up having to make handwritten notes on each of the pages so the student's could get through the hands-on problems. Without my personal notes, the student's frustration levels mounted to a point where they shut down. Once the notes were distributed, the students did enjoy the text."
1,completely misled,"As the previous reviewer stated (which I wish I had read beforehand), the picture of this product is completely misleading! I had assumed I was buying a complete case of these pads. I have never bought them before, and cannot locate them in any stores near me, so I had no reference as to whether the price was comparable to a case or not. There is no product description stating that the price is for a single pad! The picture shows a case (box)and 3 pads laying next to it (appearing to be product placement showing the specific color of the pad...they are color coded for those that don' know). Because of these factors, I had made an educated guess that I was buying a case....6 actually, 2 of these, and 4 of a different grade. Imagine my surprise when I opened the small box UPS delivered to find only 6 pads in it!I am currently trying, with no luck, to contact MSC to get this rectified."
1,never reieved the product,recieved one of the two products from this company and worte to let them know I did not recieve this one. They said they'd ship it out but I never recieved it. oh well
1,Not at all useful.,"The tape is not at all useful. It is difficult to learn Tai Chi from a tape and impossible to learn it from this one. The style is not well know in the US. The tape is not presented in a manner conducive to learning. The most popular Tai Chi style in the US is the Yang style. If you wish to try to learn Tai Chi from a tape, try ""Tai Chi for Health"" with Terry Dunn. The tape first shows the entire short form with a brief history of the art. That is followed with step-by-step instructions. The tape ends with the entire form again. I learned the sequence in about 4 months of intermittent study but constant practice. It is a nice form. I prefer to work with an instructor. He/she can explain more details and watch your form."
5,Samba: Resistance in Motion,"This is a fascinating look at movement in Brazil and the relationships between different types and styles of movement. This is a good place to start an exploration of this subject. It is a subjective account, although the historical information seems to be adequately researched. The value is more in the vivid snapshot the author creates of a period in the development of music and movement in the country, rather than as a comprehensive historical depiction. The author sometimes moves back and forth in ways that may seem unrelated until later in the book, so readers should be patient."
2,A tough and Trying Read,"I am a high school sophmore. I was assigned this book for my honors report in my World Cultures class. When I was first told that this would be my book I was excited because I thought that I would learn a lot about history and be able to betterstand the world around me. NOPE! Im sure that I didnt understand a single word in the entire book. The book covered so many topics that each was given just an overview. No background information was offered an I continually had to ask my father what the millions of acronyms stood for. I hated the book. It was pure suffering for me to read. I wouldnt ever recomend this book to anyone who is looking to begin a study of history. Only if you have a strong knowledge of history, and you enjoy reading lots of ratios and whatnot would I ever reccomend this book."
4,MAGNIFICENT SERVICE,"I have been ordering textbooks for about a yr.now from Amazon. By far, this is the best service I have come across.Thanks for your excellent customer svc."
1,A dumb kid can talk to horses! oh wow!,"This book was the dumbest book I have ever read. I mean- HELLO this isn't fairy tale land. The dumb kid can talk to horses- ooooh how original! I don't think so. CRAPPY. In my opinion this book was DUMB. I've read MUCH better books than this one. If I could give this book a 0 star, i would. This book is totally boring & nothing interesting happens and boy did it suck!I'm telling you,DO NOT read this stupid book, Michael Slade-- you can do better.STUPID STUPID STUPID"
5,Fox Run Double Sided circle cookie cutters,"Sturdy, worked well without the dough sticking to the cutter. Love all the different sizes. The different sizes allow room for a lot of creativity. I have daughters who love to bake."
5,A love story...but so much more!,"Powers of Fate is the love story between Mario and Antonella. But it is so much more than just a love story...it's a slice of history...a story of destiny...two lives from two different worlds, eventually coming together. It provides a personal view of World War II from both a soldier's and a victim's point of view. Powers of Fate is a wonderful story of courage, survival, personal growth and the strong bonds of love and devotion of family. Reading this book is an invitation sit by the fire and look through a close friend's family album or read their diary. It's about the power of love and about all the women who left their homelands, families, and everything their lives were made of, for the sake of it.Cecilia A. Schneider, Santa Barbara, CA"
2,One out of three...,"This is a collection of 3 stories - the first one is so shallow and the characters so vapid that it almost discourages you right then and there from watching any of the rest. The 2nd story unfortunately does little to revive your interest, its only slightly better than the first in that you do feel something for the bufoonish chracters and do get a feel for the atmosphere of life in a working-class Tel Aviv neighborhood. But the 3rd story more than makes up for the first two - its funny and engaging and suspensful all at once. If you get this movie just skip past the first 2 parts."
4,INTELLIGENT BALLADS PERFECTLY INTERPRETED,"This collection contains Richard Harris' magnum opus, the majestic MacArthur Park that has been so much covered, even by Donna Summer in 1978. He performs this impressive song with the subtlety it requires, soulful and understated at first and then with greater passion after the instrumental break. Didn't We Also Make It This Time is a good interpretation of a well known song and my other favourites include A Tramp Shining, the beautiful The Yard Went On Forever (a song of childhood nostalgia that comes close to MacArthur Park), and One Of The Nicer Things. The orchestral arrangements are splendid throughout and Harris wraps his voice expertly around the poetic lyrics of Jimmy Webb. You'll love this album if you enjoy smooth balladry and intelligent lyrics."
1,sick idiots,"grossly dumb fools in need of violent correcting ruined these classic recordings by bungled remastering, eliminating the tracks' dynamic range so as to make them sound more like what they've been told is the sound of Today. those nabobs. i hate them. i do hate them."
2,Uninspiring,"I wasn't impressed with this CD. I primarily purchased it to get a copy of MacArthur Park, one of my all time favourtie songs. It is pretty much the only track worth listening to. The sound quality is grainy, Harris' voice is thin and reedy, and the songs are uninspiring."
2,"Except for ""Mac Arthur Park"", pure sludge","Jimmy Webb is an interesting composer. He either writes great songs or terrible ones. There is no middle ground with him. If you have heard his hits, you have heard all of his valuable work. Mac Arthur park was a hit, and, deservedly so. It is musically captivating. Though the lyrics have been made fun of, they make sense to me. A wedding was meant to take place in Mac Arthur park and the woman stood him up at the altar. That explains the (wedding) cake being left in the rain. It is a song of loss. It is a great song. The rest of this album is sludge to my ears. Lots of syrupy strings, little melody, lyrics that try too hard to be poetry and end up sounding like a bad greeting card. Richard Harris can barely sing, but his voice DOES work on Mac Arthur park. The rest of this album stinks."
5,The Webb Sessions 1968-69,"Anyone who wishes to know what made the music of the 60's so special need look no further than this album. From the simple elegance of 'Didn't We' and 'Dancing Girl' to the complex imagery of 'MacArthur Park"" and 'The Yard Went On Forever' this album displays the talents of one of the finest songwriters of the 20th Century sung by someone who really understands the music and lyrics. There may be individual songs by Jimmy Webb that others have interpreted better, but you will never find a more perfect combination which highlights Webbs's genius than this compliation of two great albums. It is one of those rare albums that does not date: reflecting both its time and yet still managing to be relevant today. Anyone interested in the best music of the 60's would have to have this CD."
4,putting is key,"While it is true that putting is 90% mental, there are some very good suggestions on both attitude and technique in this book."
4,putting technique,This is an excellent book. I personally prefer Stan Utley's book but it was interesting to note the areas where Utley and Stockton agree and differ.The one thing that is clear from both books is that there are many legitimate ways of putting.
2,Dave Stockton's Putt to Win,"I watched Dave Stockton on the PGA tour and have always admired his putting ability. After he retired and became a putting guru I looked forward to his book on putting. Did he adequately describe his putting stroke? Yes. Having a proper stroke is essential yet it is only part of putting. Every book I have ever read on putting does a poor job on 'reading greens' and this book also does a poor job on this aspect. I don't care how well you strike the putt, if you don't know how to read the contours of the greens you will miss the putt by feet and not inches. I recommend you seek out a PGA professional who will teach you how to read greens. Not all PGA professionals are equal in this regard so ask around different clubhouses. Once you can adequately read the contours of the greens you will understand the break, understand the grain, and finally be able to judge the speed of the putt."
3,so-so after 1 round!,"Couldnt help feeling somewhat disappointed after reading it. Guess Im more of a mechanical type player... this book talks more about feel and positive thinking! Anyway... it did help me hit the sweetspot more often (the book does dwell a little on mechanics) and since Ive only played one round after reading this, I guess its too soon to judge!"
4,StocktonPTW,A good book which takes most of the mechanics out of putting. It enforced my belief that the smaller muscles should control the putter. Back to the way I putted 50 years ago
4,Good,I think the book is well written and Stockton simplifies the art of putting. I am sure it will help most people. I highly recommend it.
5,This putting book is a winner,"One of the game's greatest putters helps the rest of us putt better. Although he provides some great hints on technique, better yet was his help on attitude. Approach menatally to putting is everything, once one has a basic technique down. I also really benefited from his method of reading greens. This book has helped me putt the ball in hole more often. Thanks Dave."
2,hard to follow moves,"I bought the other Nekea Brown DVD and I really liked it and found it challenging for a step DVD. This one...not so much. Now I'm not the most coordinated person in the world, but I really found the queuing and explanation of the moves to be difficult to follow on this one. Sometimes I don't get all the moves the first few times, but geez with this one, I've done it about 10 times and I'm still lost! Lost = bored = no sweat or increased heartrate! I move one to something else so that I could actually work out without having to rewind several times!"
4,It is a good book to have in your list,This is one of the standard books for preparing for catholic high schools.However it is not the only one. I bought the book for my son's exam preparations. It has served its purpose. Gave him a good idea about the test questions. It made him feel confident.
1,BEWARE - DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"I second the comments of the previous Reviewer. The Publisher and Editors of this book should be SUED for allowing so many errors. It is terribly frustrating for kids trying to complete 15-30 seconds per question when, a) there are no correct answers, b) there are multiple correct answers, c) there are typo's or missing information in the questions. And the Answer Key is full of errors too. Just awful !!"
1,Book is full of mistakes--BEWARE--do not buy,"This book is full of mistakes in the diagnostic tests, as well as the full practice tests. There are multiple mistakes in every section--verbal and math. Do not use the answer keys--they are wrong! OFten they contradict themselves. If you buy this, make sure you check your child's work, and correct the mistakes in the book."
1,Don't buy this book!,"Don't waste your money (and time) on this book! It is filled with errors as other reviewers have cited. I only wish I had read their reviews before I purchased this book for my child, who encountered more than a dozen errors on the practice tests. The editors and proofreaders of this book should be ashamed! I am talking about the 2009 edition with the orange cover. Another reviewer says this book is an improvement over a previous edition. Faint praise at best."
2,Excellent if it lasts,"Over the past few years I have owned a number of these machines and all have broken down . I'm lucky that all were within the warranty period . I will say that I use it for two 25 minute periods a day but they break down too easily and are not as durable as they advertise . I would gladly pay more if I knew they would last . They all break in the same place . You would think that they would do something to improve quality . While working ,there isnothing better but workmenship is lacking . By the way I weigh less than 185 so my weight is not an issue ."
2,Be ready to use the warranty...,"We had this machine for 4 months before it broke and needed to be replaced. Our's broke at at a welded section under the handle, where the bar coming up from the foot stirrup meets the cross bar under the handle. My wife was the only one using the machine and she is 200 lbs, well below the suggested weight maximum, so this seems like shoddy work to me.At the end of the day, the $300 we spent on it would have been better served getting a membership to a gym for three years."
1,Fitness Quest Inc in Ohio is Closed,Gazelle Power Plus. I have been trying to locate current information on Fitness Quest Inc in Ohio to get replacement parts for a Gazelle Power Plus. I have found that that location in Ohio is closed and haven't found any other information on it. Does anyone have another company that replacement parts for their products can be purchased from?
3,Could last longer,"This is a great product to use if you are trying to lose weight. Since I live in an apartment, it fit just right. The only problem was, after about 2 years of using it, it started making this really loud noise. Apparently something in the hadle bars had decided to pop off from it and I couldn't replace it. This also happened to the bar that connects the piston to the body too. So not only did it make a loud noise and made me felt like I was going to fall off of it, I couldn't even use the pistons anymore.But, the workout you get is good and it helped me to maintain the weight I was at. Just be careful of it after about a year of owning it."
5,The way to lose weight!,"This is the best machine to use for losing weight! You feel great, look great, and have a happier life! It is so easy and fun to use. I used to have the slimmer gazelle and have now switched to this one. The pistons are a great addition and provides an extra workout. But if you are just starting out I would start with the lowest level.This machine is also easier on the joints. The difference between this model and the other models is that it feels sturdier and has the power pistons. The only flaw I found is the exercise video it came with. It is this women who I dont even know doing the workout routine. I want Tony Little!!! I had to buy his workout video because Tony Little is the best in getting you motivated! You can get the video at his website: www.tonylittle.com Overall, the Gazelle Power Plus earns an A plus in my book!"
3,squeaking!,"Bought the Power Plus 8 weeks ago to replace 2 other Gazelles that we have had and gotten rid of due to squeaking so badly that they could no longer be used. This squeaking emanates from the connections to the rear parts of the foot pads where the cables connect. I am finally beginning to realize that this is an apparent design flaw that unfortunately has not been corrected with the Power Plus. We have oiled the connections and tightened the bolts that can be tightened but it does not improve it. There are also pieces of black that keep shedding off of these areas. I am truly disappointed since this is a great way to exercise without killing your knees! But I am not willing to keep replacing these Gazelles if they cannot fix the flaws, especially since the costs are much higher now."
4,Fun,"It's very sturdy, it's held up well. I have no complaints and have been using it for over a year now. I like how you can increase resistance. It does squeak a little now, but not much and not to the point it would concern me. I just wish I could store it away somehow when it's not in use as it does take up a bit of room in my tiny apartment."
1,Ratt CD,"I ordered this product as a Christmas gift, received an email that it had been shipped. Then received another email that I could expect delivery between Dec. 20 - Jan. 7. For the price paid (almost $200), I would think it should have been sent UPS so there would be a tracking #. Never received CD (it is now Jan. 30th). I did receive credit to my account in full (they say they do not have a replacement), but that doesn't help that someone did not receive their Christmas gift! Very disappointed in shipping method."
4,warren guitar wiz,"In a few words raw guitar work by warren. warren de martini is a guitar wiz. since this ep is not around anymore, cause its out of print, and if you can get a hold of one do it, and hold on to it cause its worth keeping, really it will be worth some money later not that it means get rid of it, but really hold on to it. it won't be easy to find later."
3,"Good Basic Information, Some Detail Inaccurate","I have recently purchased this book to get information about agencies I where might want to apply. It provides the addresses and some phone numbers for most larger agencies. It was lacking in information for some of the smaller towns. In one instance, the name of an agency was incorrectly listed (I worked with this agency & knew first-hand what it should have been). This might be minor, but for an applicant sending a letter of inquiry, it would not look very professional to ask about employment if you don't know what the department's name is! Overall, though, the basic information is there (no web sites, though), and a little leg work can get you the rest."
5,A Definite 80's Classic,"This being one of three 5 STAR recordings by INXS. I can't get enough of this album. Almost every song on this album had a video and it was a total breakthrough album as well. Starting with ""Original Sin"" and all the way to the last note of ""All The Voices"" it is fantastic. Sandwiched in-between those songs you have ""I Send A Message"", ""Melting In The Sun"", ""Dancing On The Jetty"" and my favorite track ""Burn For You"". ""Love Is (What I Say)"" is also a great song. You can't go wrong with this one."
4,A good introduction to Django Reinhardt,"This cd was enjoyable for a listening session. There are enough familiar tracks (""Paper Moon"" and ""Pathetique"") to pique the interest in the European Jazz of Django Reinhardt.It takes a couple of spins to get to know this album. I had never listened to DR before. The music reminded me of what Don Ho would play on his ukelele during his TV show run. Only when you realize when it was recorded can you appreciate the innovation of his music. Jazz is American in creation. It is also quite rhythmic in tempo. Reinhardt and other Europeans broke that convention with arrythmic variations to their music.I may be wrong, but, Django's influence can be detected in Led Zeppelin of all places (Jimmy Page using a bow on his guitar!).All in all if you want to learn about European Jazz this disc is a good place to make a start."
4,Greatest Guitarist Ever! Great Packaging! Good Sound!,"No less a guitar great than Les Paul has declared Django the best guitarist that there has ever been. Les Paul should know as he's lived through many of them including Eddie Van Halen. From a guy who totally improvised great solo after great solo at speeds that Eddie could only reach by using his two-handed technique, Django just used the two working fingers of his left hand. Incredible! I used to own the old 2-disc ""Djangologie"" covering his material prior to this period and although his playing was great to hear, the hiss and bad recording wasn't so I'm glad although we have here the '49 version and only 23 tracks, the sound quality is vastly improved and is decent considering what must have been the condition of the original master after all these years. I also like the cardboard packaging and the liner notes. If you like to hear great jazz guitar played in the acoustic style, this is the one to get. Recommended."
1,"Right title, wrong book","The book I received was not the illustrated version depicted, just a plain hardcover version. Could have bought that from someone else for half what I paid for this."
5,A very intimate look at a very talented player,"Scoop is a collection of Pete's home recordings and demo's for the Who. What makes this collection so outstanding is the view we get of his works in progress. You can hear his original ideas for ""Bargain"" and see how close it was to the finished version on Who's Next and then turn around and here the differences from the seed of ""Magic Bus"" and the one we know from the actual release. What cements this CD as an all time masterpiece however is the vast collection of songs that never saw the light of day anywhere. These were essentially Townshend's throw-aways, songs that never went anywhere but in Pete's head. These tunes display the genius that Townshend possesses, and that his abilities extend far beyond his hits. Fans of the Who should consider Scoop an essential part of any collection, and anyone who appreciates eclectic songwriting will love this record."
5,Get A Scoop Of Pete,"I first heard this album back when it first came out in '83. It was love at first listen. It has been in my Walkman/Discman/iPod ever since. First of all, I am a huge Who and Townshend fan. Listening to this album was like being in on the creative process. It was also very enlightening to hear classic Who tunes as Townshend first recorded them, as he first imagined them, before any of the other members of the band had any input into the final product. And some of the songs that didn't make it onto a Who or Townshend album are a pure delight (Cookin'?)Just a great slice of Who and Townshend history that still sounds great over 25 years later."
4,tapes almost forgotten,"this is a double cd which i bought in vinyl form many years ago. it's the first of three, maybe the best (but the whole series is at least very interesting). it's a collection of tapes that Pete used to conserve in his recording studio. there are many tracks, most of them would become hits or versions by the Who, played by Townshend at synthesizers or acoustic guitar, or both. it's a must for fans of the group, but it could be useful for the others. it's cheap, too. enjoy your listening."
2,Edition Problem,"I bought this box set twice and both times I had to send it back.Two or three cds can only be played in the first tracks and sometimes in the cd player you'll read the message NOT DISC or after cleaning this cds will play and stop,play and stop and you will never listen to the complete songs.I think it is an Edition Problem a big mistake for Global Underground."
1,A Disappointing Book,"Despite the fact that the info page for this book carries the publishing date of 1997, the book was first published in 1965, and it is showing its age. Much of the information is sadly out of date. For example, recent and widely published work on the equine eye has discredited the ramped retina theory. Nonetheless that theory is presented as state of the art information. The information in each chapter is repetitive, poorly organized, frequently uninformative, and to make matters worse, the writing style is dry as dust. I am not suggesting that horsemen from an earlier era have nothing of value to share with us, but this particular book is not worth the time it takes to read it."
1,Not worthwhile,"As another reviewer said, stale information. There's been a heck of lot of research into horses since this book was first published fifty years ago that has made this book obsolete.If you're interested in the actual mind of the horse, how they and other animals think and what they think about, Temple Grandin's book Animals in Translation is a fascinating alternative."

5,"Great Literature, Delivered Very Elegantly","I am 64 and have been listening to various types of music for 50 years but only recently discovered Kate Wolf. She immediately became my favorite singer/songwriter. It seems that her music is the music I have always been looking for but had never found. I agree with another reviewer who noted that one can listen to Kate almost continually without tiring of her. I was very saddened to learn of her untimely passing just when she was reaching her pinnacle.I have now acquired almost all of Kate's recordings and this album contains most of her best songs but a few are missing like ""Love Still Remains"" and ""Great Love of my Life"".All Kate Wolf fans should watch the ""Evening in Austin"" video to see the refined professional she had become just a few months before she came down with leukemia."
5,magnificent,"if you are a folk music fan.. if you love great lyrics and wonderful.. instrmental backup.. if you love passion and feeling.. if you love a beautiful,clear, fresh voice.. you will love this album.. stumbled onto it today at a music store, and listened to it twice ... thats five hours.... just ordering three more sets for my children."
5,De Best Mouse!,"If you liked U-Neek get this one! Starts off with Zum-Galli excellent, Local Fisherman wow! I love every track, Good Eek all the way through! My first album (yes LP) was Wa-Do-Dem and this release, U-neek and the original are my favorites! The others only have a few tracks I like (including both best of's). Get it!"
5,Very emotional and written extremely well,"In the second book in this series, Heather gets a letter from her birth mother, Donna, and doesn't tell anyone about it in fear that her adoptive mother will be hurt by it. However, Mrs. Cohen has already talked to Donna about the letter and now it's up to Heather to decide if she wants to meet her birth mother. This one is a bit more serious than the first and third books, but still great all the way. It made me wonder if the author had had a simliar experience for it was written in so much detail."
1,This book is EXACTLY the same as DAUGHTER OF GOD,by another publisher!!!! I read Daughter of God and then bought this book. It looks like they re-published it under the Daughter of God title to take advantage of the Da Vinci Code popularity since this book was published ~1988.
4,gorillas in the mist,this movie came in very good shape and in very good shape. along with all that it is a very interesting movie about a lady doing studies on gorillas and living right with them. Good movie.
5,excellent,"i loved this movie! when you think about the incredible odds that she overcame by going into the jungle, a city girl living in isolation, that she was so involved in her work wasnt so surprising. i actually bought this movie as a gift for my daughter because she wanted it to add to her collection"
5,Diane is a hero for Animal Rights!,"One of my favorite all time movies. I love the relationship between Diane and Simbagari. This movie portrays the plight of the mountain gorilla and Diane Fossi's fight to protect a regal species that is defenseless against man. She is one of my mentors because her determination, rage against the atrocities, and passion for the protection of these gorilla's is boundless. A MUST see."
5,Sigourney WeAver,"captures the heart of a woman (Diane Fossey..)who many people claim was nicer to animals than peoplE.Sigourney probably worked with the same Gorillas in the movie that DiAne Fossey did.My anThropology teacher claims that Weaver had Fossey down pat: Her loOk and voice.I'm never tired of looking at Sigourney on screen:She's just a force and a serious actor at heart: Her comedies are not without serious statement too.This is a movie where she's taking some risks.Sci-Fi or comedy,seriOus roles--Shes really quite got it all.A role modEl.A gay icon and stRaight mother..Nothing fazez this woman does it?"
2,Poorly written,"The Pros:The author is a physicist, and so provides a solid analysis of the physical possibilities of tomorrow's wars.The cons:The author is a physicist, and can't write his way out of a paper bag.There is some interesting material in here, but the painful writing style makes it hardly worth the effort. Frequent digressions and asides (like this one!) make the text difficult to follow. Key points are skipped over while others that to me seem obvious are covered in excessive detail.Worse, I think, is that the analysis is just not very imaginative or insightful. The technological possibilities are explored adequately, but the political consequences of those possibilites are handled clumsily, if at all.I found this book frustrating. The author obviously knows his stuff, and I kept thinking ""this SHOULD be interesting"".But it's not."
4,Great Cd! Love the enhanced part of it.,"This cd is good. The best part is the enhanced part on it. It has all of their full video's on it (26cents, Fly(The Angel Song), Boy Oh Boy, and Jimmy's Got a Girlfriend). It also has a five minute video of the making of Jimmy's...., a screensaver, wallpaper's, links to there sites, pic's and there bio. Any Wilkinson fan will love this cd."
5,This is worth every cent!,"When I read the reviews from the pros, I try to figure out where they come up with that stuff... Not only is this CD great to listen to, but when I heard Tyler sing those solos, my heart nearly skipped a beat. This kid can sing! The listener can really tell that he feels what he is singing. Amanda and her father have done an excellent job, too, but Tyler shines through this time. Each track is unique and heartfelt. I would review each individual song, but I would sing my praises for each...It would get tedious. Just buy the CD, trust me and all the other fans out there."
5,THIS IS SIMPLY THE BEST,"Mandy Barnett is on the verge of stardom. She has managed, along with the late Owen Bradley and his brother Harold to recapture the true ""Nashville Sound."" Musicians the likes of Pig Robbins, Buddy Harman and Hal Rugg have given support this young women deserves by playing in her band. Although the obvious is to compare her to the late Patsy Cline, Ms. Barnett is truly a stylist in her own right and at the age of 23 has a uncommon understanding of the music she has chosen to sing. She has a smooth, sophisticated sound and this seems to be rare in Nashville these days. I don't know of anyone to whom she can be compared. This CD is full of powerful stuff and Ms. Barnett has done us all a favor by recording it."
4,"Young, Talented, and Beautiful","I hope Barnett doesn't make a career of mimicking Patsy Cline. She's too good a singer to live in someone else's shadow. It's nice to hear a latter-day tribute to the Owen Bradley sound, and at times, it's almost as if Patsy is there in the room. But I like the songs that point to Barnett's possible future, like ""Ever True Evermore,"" a western swing number in which, instead of perfectly reproducing Cline's cloying, restrained swooning, Barnett lets that big, pure voice of hers run free."
5,Mandy is a Breath of Fresh Air,I've been a Mandy fan for several years now and no one comes close to her talent. If you think her albums sound great you should see her in person. You can log onto mandymusic.com for more information on this incredible young woman.
5,A special talent,"Mandy is definitely a special talent. Her voice packs an emotional wallop that will knock your socks off. Pity that most country radio stations probably won't play her. Her music definitely doesn't fit in with most of the over-produced, inoffensive and emotionally vacant dross being churned out these days by the Nashville hit-making machinery. Guess you'll just have to buy this CD to find out how good she is!"
2,Starts off with promise then goes downhill.,"Chuck Austen's run on the book starts off looking like a classic, fun superhero story. Sure there are a few kinks, but they can be ironed out as time goes on. Unfortunately, that's not what happens. These kinks grow to be major problems and start to overshadow any good that there is in the writing. The characters start to act less and less like themselves, the dialogue gets worse and worse, and sexula themes are just clumsily thrown on en masse in unnecessary and uncreative ways, in hopes that just their presence will be enough to entertain."
1,"Excuse me, I've lost my plot device, could I borrow yours?","If you're an X-Men fan, there are hundreds of other stories that you should read before this one. Not because this story depends on the others, but because the others are all better. This story is weak. Really weak. Contrived plot devices and poor charactorization. Some of the reviews of this comic are better reads than the comic itself. If you want a real story, check out Grant Morrison's New X-Men. While he uses stock stories (evil twins, anti-mutant groups, secret government agencies, and other cliches), he manages to make them interesting again."
1,"Lacking, at best.","By no stretch of imagination is this a good story. But even so, this is Chuck Austen at his finest. Sammy's story is somewhat interesting, and there's something to be said for the actual plot. It makes sense, at least, although absurd coincidences nd other contrivances are immediately apparent. The artwork is also decent. Not recommended, but it's bearableI would absolutely advise against buying this, unless if you can find it at a very, very low price. It isn't worth more than four dollars."
2,Description not fully made,The chips sounded so good with sun dried tomatoes and balsamic vinegar but the first taste was almost to hot to bear. Since I do not like spicy things and do not think that the bag stated it would be hot it was quite a shock.Because it was a large box it was really too much trouble to send it back plus the postage would be high so I lost them all.If you like spicy food you might try these but otherwise stay away.
1,Very bad actors and sound!!,"I just got done watching this movie and would not recommend it to anyone. The sound was terrible, sometimes it was hard to hear and understand what anyone was saying. The actors in this movie did some of the worst acting I have ever seen. I would suggest renting this movie instead of buying it that is for sure. This must have been and extremely low budget movie so buyers beware. Not a great movie!!"
1,DEAD MOVIE!!!!!!,"I HAVE JUST PURCHASED THIS DVD ( WASTE OF MONEY . I JUST FINISHED WATCHING IT ( WASTE OF MY TIME). THIS IS ANOTHER HOME MADE HORROR. THE SOUND, PICTURE QUALITY WAS BAD I MEAN REALLY BAD. THE ACTING MADE YOU SQUIRM AS WITH THE DREADFUL DIALOGUE.WHY CAN'T THESE PEOPLE JUST FIND EMPLOYMENT IN THE REAL WORLD AND STOP RIPPING PEOPLE OUT OF THERE HARD EARNED CASH TO BUY THIS TRASH. IT SEEMS THEY PUT AN AWFUL MOVIE IN A GREAT DESIGNER COVER AND SUCK US IN. OH, AND THE COVER HAS PRINTED ON IT UNRATED, NOW I KNOW WHY! MAYBE AMAZON SHOULD HAVE A PREVIEW OF MOST MOVIES SO WE SEE THE QUALITY BEFORE WE BUY THE TRASH. THIS IS SOOOOOOO BAD PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY OR BUY MY COPY. yuk!!!!"
5,Deadhouse,"This movie is a top notch thriller, great acting, especially cara dalton, unbelievable and what a hotty!!! must see..."
2,Criminal law & criminal procedure,did not have a lot of updated information. the language was not very friendly. common law languagewas not very user friendly.
1,Awful,I payed for expedited shipping and it took three days for the seller to even ship it out. The book finally arrived ten days later and its not even new. I payed for a book listed new and the cover is dirty and there is writing on the inside of the cover. Highly disappointed and a waste of money. If I didn't need this book to take my final exam next week I would return it. How this seller has so many good reviews I don't know. Obviously you can't always trust the review rating percentage.
3,"there was black tape all over the book and it was an insructors edition, the pages are all good and everything though",the tape was covering the words on the front cover of the book. It was becuase the book was a test edition and also a teacher's edition. the book is the same as a students book that i could of bought in the book store. the only downside was the tape on the book. i would of liked to know about that before i received it.
5,Nice,Very happy with this. Good quality. We got tired of constantly replacing all the cheap plastic tarps. This one is much better quality and should last us a lot longer.
5,Darryl Worley,"Darryl's new album self titled, is his best yet. If you have any of his previous albums, you won't be disappointed with this one. If you are new to Darryl Worley what are you waiting for get your copy today."
1,Have you ever wanted to ram ice picks in both your ears?,"On our way from Kansas City, MO to Albuquerque, NM last week, somewhere near Amarillo TX, this song came on the radio. My wife and I laughed and laughed at first. ""Who could write a song this bad?"" I thought with a smug smile on my face.Then terror came over me as I wondered, ""Who could like a song this bad?"" Of course, I WAS in Texas. But still...This guy is a no-talent as.s clown with a penchant for cliche yung kuntry choruses and pathetic attempts to cash in on jingoist sentiments with lyrics like ""have you forgotten about Bin Laden?""Do the world a favor and don't buy this idiot's music"
1,Not your feel good bears of past.,"I'm not too surprised that they are not the same care bears of the past, but they could have at least tried. These bears are smaller than the original and are made of a hard plastic. The feel of them is not enticing to my 3 yr old. Their arms and legs do not move, and I'm still trying to figure out the point of the stars on the clouds. The cloud that moves with the bear on it squeaks as it rolls and the umbrella doesn't move unless you move it with your hand. It has gone straight to the ""I don't want to play with it bucket."""
4,Entertaining video,"This video has a good mix of stage banter between songs and great performances. The footage is more ""natural"" than the 20th anniversary video -- Maddy plays to the camera a bit too much in that version.Purchase this -- you won't be disappointed."
5,A SUPERB FILM: ESSENTIAL CRICKET HISTORY...,"A very well done film, focusing on the history of West Indies international cricket mainly from the 1970's through the 1990's. A very exciting account of the emotional ride and courageous battle this core of great players endured during their ""golden age"" of dominance.Personal accounts by Viv Richards, Joel Garner, Colin Croft etc. make this a most accurate and thrilling journey through an unbelieveably successful period of cricket. Controversy, Kerry Packer, stereotypes, etc. abounded, but nothing deterred from the overcoming victory of this unique group of players. The action footage of these incredible athletes is worth the price of the dvd alone.This is an essential film for all sports fans, and even those just interested in the social and political trends in the West Indies during the era in question.GREAT."
1,Wrong zone for NZ,Wont work on our DVD as the wrong zone for New Zealand. Pretty stink Christmas present this proabbly should be mentioned when purchasing from overseas.
1,Did not play on my American BluRay.,"Well, that was very Disappointing. The description indicated the disc would play in US players, but that was not the case."
1,Dose not work!,the Blu-ray dose not work at all. its just a blank disk. i tried it in 2 different players and also in a play station.
1,This rating is for the film,"I imported this blu-ray disc from UK twice, and none of them played in my Sony BD player. This disc is not region free as it says..."
1,Not Pleased,"I am very unhappy with this purchase. I read many good reviews about this particular documentary. With my Dad being a West Indian and an avid cricket fan, I thought this DVD would make the perfect gift for him. However, when I tried to play the DVD it would not work and the screen was just plank. Needless to say that my Dad was very DISAPPOINTED. Because the gift came from me I received the blame and I had to be the one who was apologizing to everyone. This is the first time in my many years of buying from Amazon that I was not at all satisfied with my purchase. I gave it a rating of one star only because there was nothing lower. I would like to receive my money back or receive a brand new replacement DVD in working condition. I suggest that in the future that you test your products before sending them out."
4,Refresh our thinkings about Sales,The book is very important to refresh our thinkings about Sales.There are a lot of ideas ( no new ideas ) that will help us to revival our Sales strategies and ways to manage our Sales Depts.
3,Good for older seadoos,Good overview repair manual for older SeaDoos or general maintenance. Seloc books are reasonably easy reading if you can't get the manufacturer manual.
2,"Buy another copy of ""Live 1981-86""","JJ's best band was the N&D1 band, and his live album 1981-86 proves it. This album brings us a good version of ""Is she really going"", but the rest is nothing but a pale shaddow of the original from the 80's. I like JJ music enough to be hoenst and tell, that his N&D2 is not comparable to the original, and so that live album, that was made by N&D2 band. Dissapointment would describe very well my feelings."
2,Antiques,"This was a birthday present for a relative that enjoys ""junking"" or the art of recognizing the value of an item."
1,Helen Trent,I wonder if anyone who has listened to this album knows what the title means and who Helen Trent was. I cannot imagine that the people who like this kind of music could possibly know. Here is a hint: radio.
5,The Eternal Sadness of the burdened heart,"Military history focuses on battles and campaigns in linear time stopping and starting around the time of the war. WW2 Memoirs cover in greater detail the lives of the particpants usually before and during the war but usually stop there or only give a brief postscript. This work is unusual because the author tells you up front the basic story and then unfolds it from there. The knowledge of Norval Carter's fate looms like a shadow over the story but nevertheless his death and his son's (the co-author)discovery of his father still will bring the tears when you get to those pages. This is a story about the meaning of courage, sacrifice and the meaning of being a father and husband. The story covers the events of the war and the buildup for D-day in enough detail that even someone with no knowledge or interest in military history will enjoy and understand this story. At a slim 199 pages it is a very quick read. I highly recommend this book for anyone."
2,Dubious judgment.,"I lost faith in Cooper's book before I even got to 1933. If you want the German Army's self-portrait, look here & in Barnett's ""Hitler's Generals."" Otherwise, read elsewhere.An example from memory: discussing WW1, Cooper trots out as if they were true the platitudes about the army's remaining steadfastly non-political. This works if you forget that Ludendorff was *running the country* in 1917-18, having arrogated dictatorial powers to himself, cowed the Kaiser, run off Bethmann-Hollweg, etc., etc.Needless to say, the ""non-political"" bit is nonsense, in WW1, during Weimar, and after Hitler's accession."
4,the German Army 1933-1945 a review by joe schmo,"The German Army 1933-1945 is a book that is essential to understanding the great conflict of world war II.Much of the information which has been documented thousands of times over the last fifty years has been compiled in a refreshing new manner, reversing many outdated concepts of the German war machine held by the world today.Particularly analitical in terms of the effect of Hitler in the years of conquest and equally so in the two years of Germany's disasterous collapse.Perhaps one of the more entertaining, unbiased reports of the six year war and the entire era for Germany."
4,The German Army's Military Failure,This was a great book outlining the Germany army from its conception in 1933 to its end in 1945. Cooper explains in great detail the relationship between Hitler and his Generals. It also details battle throughout the war and Cooper makes great use of German General's journals. It is a great read and a must for anyone with interest in World War II.
4,NOT SO BAD,"THis book is not so bad as TOm Munro below says it is. After all, there will always be controversies when writing about WW II, be it covering the German, Russian or Allied side. THe book is concise and coehrent, well written and with dynamic reading, one of the best you can get in only one volume."
3,review,"The transformer is small and took a long time to arrive, even with expedited shipping. But my grandson does enjoy playing with it and the colors are vibrant. At 5 he is a huge transformer fan, with more than 100 transformers."
5,THE HARMONY IN THE BACKGROUND SOUNDS SO SWEET,Theres not enough words in this world to express how good the sound of his music really is. For a long time i been truly in love with his background sound(KG) I just would like to say may god bless you.
3,Ehhh... It's OK,"See I'm a teeenager and I got this camera on sale its a great value, you get what you pay for, the software which accompainies it STINKS, but for saving memories and quick photos for someone on a tight budget its fine, though I plan on up grading. The camera is a good idea for parents with kinds which want a camera because if it gets destroyed its not alot of money but you should get memory ad it only holds 17 photos, on a good day. Peace."
2,Better for a child's hair,"I wear my thin, shoulder-length hair pulled back. This barrette is so shallow that it doesn't secure the hair. Also, the ""onyx"" color is much darker in person than in the picture."
3,Ho Hum,"This product is okay. I give it a C or C+. It's more fun, actually, to just draw the hangman stick figures on a piece of paper.I tried to use it in a Spanish class for children. Even though there were only about 6 children in the class, it was hard to use in that setting. It was too much of a distraction for the class.It might be okay for kids travelling in a car. Of course, that was the kind of setting it was made for. Maybe I'll give it to a family who is planning a road trip."
3,On Love Talker:,"I love Elizabeth Peters and believed this book to be a very good one. Although it is not one of her bests and may at times lag behind it is still a very good and interesting book. I do recommend one book though, The Seventh Sinne"
5,The Love Talker,"Unlike some previous reviewers, I thoroughly loved this story. True, Aunt Lizzie is a bit ""much,"" the romance a bit too low key, and a trio of spinster/bachelor siblings odd, but the weaving of Lizzie and Laurie's love of fairy tales into the plot is both delightful and chilling. The author keeps you guessing up until the very end, while building suspense and dread. Elizabeth Peters/Barbara Michaels can always be depended on to deliver a good romantic and/or gothic mystery."
3,Strange,"Ms. Peter is normally one of my favorite authors, but I found this one strange from beginning to end. It was entertaining, but not up to the usual. The ending in particular bothered me somewhat, it seems that a few chapters are missing."
3,data base engine,this book is wonder for all programmers who learn visual basic. it is used for back hand tools for visual basic and oracle. it is known as RDBMS.this book is wonder for all programmers who learn visual basic. it is used for back hand tools for visual basic and oracle. it is known as RDBMS.this book is wonder for all programmers who learn visual basic. it is used for back hand tools for visual basic and oracle. it is known as RDBMS.
4,Very quick but fun read,Enjoyable read. Its refreshing to have a gay detective (sort of) I will read his other book as well. Just wish it was a bit longer. Read it in a few hours. Fun though.
3,A promising debut,"This energetic thriller centers on Adrien who owns a small specialty bookstore (all mysteries) in Pasadena, California. One of his close friends is savagely murdered and the police target Adrien as the prime suspect. When another friend is also murdered, Adrien is forced to figure out the killer's identity before he becomes the next victim. And are the police detective's motives sinister or not? And what about the mysterious journalist who keeps popping up? I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery, but found the editorial errors rather distracting. And Adrien is constantly referred to as middle-aged and he's only 32!! It makes one wonder about Josh Lanyon, the author."
5,"Move Over, Hansen and Nava, Here Comes Lanyon","This is a hugely entertaining first book in a proposed new mystery series set in L.A. The mysterysurrounding the brutal murder of a young gay man is deftly and cleanly handled. What makes thebook really go is the narrator, Adrien English, whose best friend and erstwhile lover (sort of)Robert has been stabbed to death in a Los Angeles alley. Adrien finds himself implicated in thecrime, but, worse, he's being stalked himself by the person who likely killed his buddy.Adrien is a wonderful character and narrator, a real person, unlike some protagonists of moreestablished and touted series. He's funny without being mean and smart as a tack.This is a smart book, well-paced, sweet, and suspenseful too. What more could one ask for?Well, the second installment. I can't wait for A DANGEROUS THING!"
3,Enjoyable...,"I just finished reading Fatal Shadows and found myself saying, ""This was a good book!"" I ordered Josh Lanyon's next book, A Dangerous Thing, before reading Fatal Shadows, so am now *really* looking forward to it. I liked Adrien's sense of humor. I hope his and Riordan's relationship continue in the next book. I like Lanyon's dialog style of writing. If he had gone mostly narrative, it would have been boring.I would have given the book 5 stars, but the typos were bothersome because you had to re-read some passages in order to figure out what Lanyon was writing. And, the book wasn't long enough. With just 150 pages, it ended way too soon. You wanted to keep reading."
5,Do not miss this one!,"The first book in the five-part Adrien English Mysteries ""Fatal Shadows"" is a gem. It is a riveting, darkly chilling and beautifully written mystery. Bookshop owner and author Adrien's employee is murdered and Los Angeles detective, sexy Jake Riordan seems to focus on Adrien as a suspect. Adrien begins investigating on his own and the game is afoot! What makes this book a treasure is Adrien English. Adrien is a strong, lovely person whose take on his world of family, employees and Jake is funny and at times, aching painful. He's also got a wonderful, sassy mouth. The shaky relationship between Adrien and closeted Jake is angsty and moving. Josh Lanyon's writing, humor and storytelling are superior. And, Adrien is unforgettable. Just WOW! This book began my forever love affair with Adrien, Jake and Josh Lanyon's writing. This series was voted the All-Time Favorite M/M series for a reason!"
5,Favorite mystery series!,"The Adrien English Mysteries are a genius blend of romance, adventure, drama, and of course, mystery. Josh Lanyon seems to write a perfect book one after the other, but he hit the ball out of the park with this one. Adrien and his supporting cast are wonderful, well rounded and explored characters, making every new addition to the series an excitement and joy to read. The books are written in the POV of Adrien, who is sarcastic, witty, humorous, sexy... what else do you need in a good narrator?I've re-read the book several times, it never gets old!"
4,Meet Adrien English,"This is the first book about amateur sleuth Adrien English. About 222 pages in large print, author Josh Lanyon introduces the reader to a bookstore owner, aspiring writer who's one-time best friend turned employee is brutally murdered in the back alley outside his home. It's up to English to connect the dots, to discover the connection between the death of his friend and dark threats he's been getting of late.Josh Lanyon spins a simple tale of innocence, of childhood secrets and lies in a tightly framed mystery. Fatal Shadows is a solid mystery, an easy, quick read that urges the reader forward to the truth, with the hint of a relationship budding between English and closeted detective Riordan. The last 50 pages will keep you from closing the book's cover until the truth is revealed."
3,Good story...good characters...lousy editing,"I enjoyed this debut work...I liked the bookish hero, Adrien (""with an e"")English and I enjoyed the mystery.What bothered me was a complete lack of editing. Characters are introduced without any explanation or tie-in. They pop up later with identies, but there are pages and pages between them and their reason for being in the story. References are made about events, again with no lead-in explanations.A good editor could have helped this to be a great story.I look forward to more English mysteries. I just hope the author asks for assistance with subsequent stories!"
2,Unsatisfying,"The book is a reasonably entertaining quick read, at best.The typos went from mildly annoying to incredibly frustrating as the novel progressed - at two points it seems that sentences, if not paragraphs, have been dropped.It was the ending, however, which earned this book its low rating. The killer's motive is ridiculous. I don't want togive anything away here, but I thought that the ending of this story (which I think is meant to be sexy and romantic) is fairly offensive. I'd like to go into more detail as to why, but won't spoil the ending.Even the most starved gay mystery lover should feel his patience tested by this one."
4,Light Entertainment,"Very light reading. Cotton candy mystery. There's nothing in the book that I would call either romantic or erotic. For that matter, there's almost nothing really gay about the characters either. Hard-sell fans of either mystery or m/m will not find this superb. But there's no reason not to recommend this and it is a fun quick read."
3,okay story,"This is supposed to be a story about a gay cop and gay store owner investigating a murder. Of course, I bought it for the sex and kept waiting and waiting for the sex scenes to develop. I was disappointed with this author's book as well."
2,Marware is better,"See those open corners? Sooner or later you are going to scratch up your iPod on those. If you want a quality leather case, check out the Marware CEO Classic. They make 2 sizes, one for each of the 3G dimensions, so you don't have a nightmare getting your 30Gig iPod out of the case you jammed it into, and your 10, 15, or 20 gig doesn't slop around. Also uses the Multidapt system, which allows you to switch to different types of clips, even a bike clip is available.The corners of the CEO are open a tiny bit, but they should protect your iPod from all but the most bizarre of circumstances."
2,Very Poor Protection,"This is an expensive leather case (although it feels like cheap vinyl) that simply does a very poor job of protecting an expensive ipod, due to the open corners."
4,Great,"great music, stands the test of time!!!!!would recommend this cd for your collectionits classic glenn jones, would buy again."
1,PLANT'S WORST SOLO EFFORT,"I'm surprised to still see this on sale! Contrary to the reviews here, this was an experimental album that flopped for this reviewer.The songs are dodgy and Plant's musical direction is muddled. If you're a Zep fan and want to explore Plant's career - any other album except this one would be recommended.Don't waste your time on this!"
3,Worth A Listen if You Have An Open Mind,"I bought this album when it was originally released and was very disappointed. I was looking for something more similar to Plant's first two solo efforts, Principle of Moments, and Pictures at 11. This album is a big departure from those albums and from previous Zeppelin works. However, 15 or so years later, giving the album a second chance, I see that it is not so bad. You have to have an open-mind to appreciate it though and not be expecting something similar to the prior works I mention. It is more upbeat and seems less serious than the previous works. It also features female background vocals on some songs, which were and still remain to me the least desirable element on the work."
4,weak when compared to his other works but still good.,"Different sound from Robert on this record, good album but not nearly as good as his other albums. Still a must have."
3,Robert Plant's song sixes & sevens.,"Should you put on the head phones and listen to this song. It is most interesting. And, what about the instruments used. Did the guitar run his licks thru an electronic devise to obtain the tubual sound, or, was this sound produced from simply a wine bottle? Either way it was pretty cool to listen to. Thank you Mr. Plant!"
2,Kind of Like Miami Vice meets cool bass lines,"I bought this CD for the song ""Little By Little"". I love that song. The bass line is one of the best in rock history. It is right up there with the creativity of Geddy Lee's bass lines.The rest of the CD is nothing like it. In fact, it's as if you're listening to a Miami Vice episode soundtrack. It dripping in 1985.I agree that fans either will love or hate this CD. I am undecided. It's one of those CD's that probably has to be listened to at the right place at the right time. To me, driving is always best, but I haven't felt nostalgic enough for the 80's to be so enthusiastic about it.Paul Martinez, the bass player on this album, is the saving grace. How have I not heard of this guy before ? His bass lines are incredibly memorable and thoughtful. He doesn't take the least path of resistance.Other than that, the rabbit hasn't jumped out of the black hat yet for me."
3,Not for casual fans,"This album has some terrific highlights but I'd also venture to say it has 2 or 3 of the worst misses Robert ever put to tape. It was experimental, even by his standards, and in that respect, it was freeing and achieved some new things but some of them just aren't pleasant or interesting listening.I give it 3 stars as a fan. I'd expect a casual listener or fan of Zeppelin era material to give this closer to a 1.5 or 2 stars and only because they might fondly remember ""Little by Little"" being included on the soundtrack of an episode of ""Miami Vice.""Unless you're feeling nostalgic, check out ""Dreamland"" instead; also a departure for Robert but one with a startling degree of sonic success."
3,Still worth it....,"Even though its probably not his best album,its definitely a staple in his career.It really is a must-have for true fans,and just like all of his works,it may take a little getting used to but in the end its sure to please."
3,Doing what he loves to do.,"This one I was excited to buy, as it came out straight after the beautiful Honeydrippers album. I am proud of Plant for trying to reinvent himself and making a modern sound out of Zep. But only Little by Little and Sixes and Sevens are instant classics."
4,Humm...,"I felt I had to write in because of the mostly negative reviews of this effort.Maybe it is because most of these people dont know what they like, but like what they know.The band is the best he has ever played with, the sound is very, very good and all of the songs are good. Some are better than just good. The other records have one or two songs, this, on a whole, is the best record he has put out. I say, listen again!"
4,Simple but Comprehensive,"Jones manages to focus in on the most basic parts of 18th Cent. art, from its light-hearted Rococo beginnings to its more serious-minded and sometimes political NeoClassicism. What he lacks in detail he more than makes up for by writing in an accessible, straight-forward prose that doesn't require a Master's Degree in Art History to be understood. He provides numerous illustrations, many of which (unfortunately) are not in color, and he also touches on major accomplishments in architecture and landscape design. This book is a great introduction for anyone interested in a study of 18th cent. art or even for the curious layman, but it is probably too general for serious researchers."
3,Background chic,"Solidly second-tier trip hop act seems to constantly orbit that consistently quite-good-though-hardly-great quality level, with their lightly brooding, atmospherically beat-driven female vocalizations often providing splendid late-night backdrops but offering slight replay."
4,"Clear and informative, but not for newbies","If you are omnivorous, you may not be ready for this book. Brian Clement, who took over the Hippocrate's Health Center from Ann Wigmore, truly believes that raw vegetarianism is the only way to go. The book is filled with useful information, but it may be hard to digest if it's the first time you read about how living food can change your health for the better, or even for the best. The introductory part is very open and may scare you and drive you off the whole subject. If you want a book that will give you a first ""taste"" on the subject of raw vegetarianism, pick ""Be your own doctor"" by Ann Wigmore.Other than that, this health book is realistic, and informative."
4,a good intro to raw,"I had already read quite a bit about the raw diet and attended several seminars on it by the time I came across this book, so I didn't get much out of it because it is an introductory book. However, I can recommend it for those new to the idea."
1,Not so good.,"No, cause it doesnt work good. Notice how most the people have just started . Well...Mom tried this diet. She was into health foods before.Lots of yoghert and the usual health store stuff. But she still wasnt in so good health.At first you feel better on live. You think it working.Then, after a year, you arnt better.The docter tested her allergies. Suddenly she has allnew ones!! Allergic to all the raw stuff:avacados, sunflower seeds.So this diet doesnt work.Penny"
5,Breathtaking!,"This book was, simply put, breathtaking. I don't know why someone would wish to sabotage the overall rating by giving this masterpiece one star...but clearly they were not reading the same book I was. To each their own. I found the facts within the book quite accurate myself....having read more than one hundred books of its kind and finding no inconsistencies. The pictures within the book itself were magnificent and well placed throughout the book. The text itself was also very informative and showed that the author was very well versed in the ways of the cosmos...both theoretically and factually. I highly recommend this book to anyone with interest in our cosmos. You won't be dissapointed."
5,Amazing suspense,"I've grown very fond of Pronzini's ""Nameless Detective"" books in recent years. I had this one sitting in my ever-growing ""read soon"" pile, but I almost passed on it because I thought the plot --- Nameless is kidnapped, blindfolded, and then left ""shackled"" in a remote mountain cabin --- sounded pretty lame and didn't really appeal to me. But I gave it a go, and once I started reading it was the classic case of ""couldn't put it down."" This novel was not only gripping, but there were plot twists and elements to the story that I didn't expect. Both pleasing and surprising. Needless to say, this one was far from boring. In fact, I'd rank it as one of the very best in the dozen-plus books in the series that I've read so far. Pronzin has written a bunch of them and I'm happy that there are many more that I haven't read yet; always nice to have something to look forward to reading. If you have enjoyed any other books in this series, be sure not to miss this one."
2,not worth buying. Focus on his first book.,"I don't normally read self-help books, but I had read the first book by Dr. Maltz and found it appealing and interesting. I wanted to learn more and decided to purchase this second book with the hope to learn more about Psycho-Cybernetics. Much to my dismay, this second book called ""The magic power of self image psychology"" adds very little information to the good first book written by Dr. Maltz called Psycho-Cybernetics. I was expecting to learn more about the servo mechanism of success and found a book unfortunately shallow and weak. If you are interested in the works of Psycho Cybernetics by no means buy this book and purchase the premier book (Psycho-Cybernetics)where Dr. Maltz shares his experience with patients and suggests some intellectually compelling fresh ideas."
2,I LOST MY MONEY,"THE CD ARRIVED ON TIME, BUT I EXPECTED A TANGO CD AND IT TURNED TO BE FULL OF BALLADS AND SONGS. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCT IN THE BOOKLET INSIDE. IT'S ONLY ONE FOLDED PAPER WITH THE NAME OF THE SINGER AND THE TITLES. NO MUSICIANS, NO ORCHESTRA NAME, NO COMPOSERS NAME. VERY DISSAPOINTED BECAUSE I THINK I WON'T LISTEN TO DE CD ONCE MORE. I HARDLY WENT THROUGH HALF OF IT, AND IT SOUNDS ALL THE SAME."
1,Disappointing 3D and colorized version of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD,"I was very disappointed by this 3D colorized release of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. I found out after purchasing it that it was not made from the original negative or film elements, or by the original producers of the film. It is not even high def. It is grainy, colors bleached out, with poor contrast. The 3D on this release is very poor. I have seen very good releases of this film (made from the original negative) but this is not one of them."
3,Not bad second attempt for a young band,"Not a bad second attempt for a young band at the time; very similar to their debut album. Basically a rough little rock album from the New Wave period. Some great stand out tracks like 'Stay Young' and 'Night of Rebellion', but many fillers as well.This album and their debut album basically sound like warm up for their third album, 'Shabooh Shabah' which was to take the australian alternative music scene by storm in the early 80s.This is a great buy for the serious Inxs fan, especially if you are not Australian as I doubt any of these tracks made it outside of Australian college radio at the time of release. Fans from their commercial period will be found wanting however, and I wouldn't suggest this is the Inxs album for you.However it still gets several plays a year from me, and that was worth it in my book!"
3,Decent new wave pop/rock,"This effort isn't the band's best, but it's a decent album. The disc kicks off with the bass driven rock track ""Stay Young"", which is probably the most accessible and enjoyable song on the album. Following that, the rest of the album is fairly standard new wave rock fare, featuring funky intricate bass lines and guitar with accents from analog synthesizers and occassional horns...and even caribbean influences on the title track.While there are occassional elements of the band's later (and more substantial) output, this disc is quite a bit different and less memorable. If you're a fan, then you might want to pick this up for the few standout tracks... However, if you don't have the band's later albums, I would suggest starting there first..."
4,INXS' Indie Rock Album,"Stripped down, simple, with much sparer arrangements than on their later Aussie-funk-pop records, this is INXS' closest attempt at American early '80s indie rock. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But when it does click (as on ""Follow,"" and ""Stay Young""), the results are as good as those sweaty kids in the garages of Athens, Georgia."
4,A lot of wow,"Shawn Levy's book is vivid and well-written - a book about a time and a place that really seems to know its stuff. I appreciated his strong mix of first-person sources and already published material. He's got a flair for describing people and events in crisp, colorful language, a flair that suits this material well.I'm not sure he proved all his conclusions about the greater influence of ""Swinging London"" but that does not diminish the impact of the book much. Recommended."
4,wesley's 52 sermons,"a front page was missing (the one with the publisher's name, isbn, etc). other than that, i am perfectly satisfied with the book and the seller's response. the page really doesn't mean anything to me, as i didn't really care, but i believe the seller should have noted that in the description of the item."
5,These are not genuine Hershey's,"I bought these because they looked like Hershey's Kisses, and I love anything chocolate. I was dissapointed after tasting one and finding that it tasted like rotten eggs. On top of that, people were asking me for the rest of the day if I had been eating out of the toilet. It could have just been that the one I tasted had gone bad, so I give it 5 star overall."
1,Awful,"Shipping ok, but the product just sucks. It came with a lot of defects, first of all the second time I used the laser the front part just got out and couldn`t put it back because it wouldn't stay where is supposed to again. I fixed that with glue, but after using it a few times, the laser was each time bigger but less brighter, awful product and extremely expensive by the way."
3,good product,Pretty good product fairly satisfied with my purchase. I did expect a littler stronger beam withe the reviews. my friend orderes one around the same time for just a few dollars more and his is much stronger.Good shipping time pretty good quality product just wish it was a little stronger beam.
5,Green Laser Review,I gave one to my son who is a math teacher and he hasn't put it down since Christmas. The green laser is visible when pointed at something half a mile away and it's cool to see the beam all the way if there's anything in the air for the light to bounce off.
3,One Sided,"The book is good except for one issue and it's a big one. It states that it is a Ilocano to English dictionary as well as a English to Ilocano dictionary and it is NOT. It is only English to Ilocano and worthless for translating from Ilocano to English, which is why I bought it. Very dissatisfied!"
4,Ilocano: Ilocano-English/English-Ilocano Dictionary and Phrasebook,"Very good review. Although good for beginners and intermediate students, one would need a more thorough book for further study in the nuances of the language."
1,Rentals? What Rentals? This is definitely not the Rentals...,"I'm not sure what happened to the Rentals I remember. Perhaps the lovable, geeky group was kidnapped and replaced by some sort of Stepford-wife android band. Maybe the REAL Rentals have retired from the music industry and are living on a private island or something, and this is a group of clones, which, not unlike that Bizarro guy from Superman, are beginning to deteriorate into clumsy, pitiful, confused creatures. Anyway, I'm pretty sure that isn't Matt Sharp's voice. I don't remember it sounding all affected and raspy and, as some other reviewers have noted, ""british"". Not that I have a problem with British people! Don't get me wrong! The point is, PLEASE bring back the Rentals (the REAL ones), because frankly, I am not buying this. (Unfortunately, I did buy it -the album, I mean - but I only listened to it once, and that was about a year ago. I still haven't gotten over the trauma.)"
1,What the hell happened?,"I'm a big weezer fan and I really loved return of the rentals. My friends and I had been waiting and waiting for this CD to come out. We special ordered our copies, and when they finally came we tore into them with frenzied excitement. But what we heard was nothing like what we wanted to hear. I know that bands change.. but what was Matt thinking? I keep reading all of this stuff about how he recorded on a tiny little tape recorder and all this crap about how relaxed it was over in europe making the CD but it sounds like things were too relaxed. Matt's vocals are ass on a stick. Petra and the distant sounds of Moog are the only things keeping me from throwing this CD away."
2,Huge Dissappointment,"This tale has played out a thousand times. Over and over again it keeps happening throughout the world. A band puts out a GREAT first album, I mean completely genius. The second album is awful. This is a classic example. Return of the Rentals was a gift from god, but this... this is just new school punk [junk]. Some of the songs aren't that bad, but none of them pass the level of mediocrity. I don't know why he decided to sing like the typical skaterpunk poprock, but uggh. I used to think that Matt was a genius and that his leaving Weezer is what caused them to fall so far, but now I realize that 94-97 was just a really groovey time that will never be repeated. The magic is gone. Emo died with Mykel and Carli Allan."
1,I waited for this?,"On the day it was released, I called ahead to Sam Goode's to hold a copy for me, because it was the last copy in town. When i popped it into my CD player for a long drive, at first, I was unimpressed. Listened to it again, still nothing. Tried a third time, and it was my last. Instead of the Moog-gy goodness of ""Return of the Rentals"", or even the kooky falsettos from Weezer, I got a production that was put out, because Matt Sharp needed money to feed his european party trip. There was no continuity, and no catchy songs. Just music that probably sounded good when Matt Sharp was waking up from his last hangover."
3,ouch,"when matt sharp quit weezer, everyone was a bit upset, but the first rentals album rocked, weezer got a new bass player and everything was great. but this album isn't matt sharp quality, not comparing it to the other albums he's done, but looking at this album purely from a musical stand point, its not that great. and knowing what matt can do and then seeing him not do it is worse. this is an ok album, but if you don't have the first one, that would be the one to buy."
2,What happened to The Rentals?,"Every expectation I had of this album was completely crushed as I listened from beginning to end. The original sound that made ""Return of the Rentals"" such a great album is gone. This album sounds all too mainstream and nothing at all like that sound that keeps me playing ""Return of the Rentals"" over and over to this day. There's a couple okay songs but otherwise the album is a flop. Beware Rentals fans......you may be in for a big dissapointment here."
2,About the length of truly engaging material,2 1/2A sophomore release from the Weezer sideman finds his band loosing most of their Moog-heavy qualities which made them semi-attractive in the first place. What is left is a great majority of heartfelt mediocrity and a few good songs that cancel out a few bad ones.
5,"Like Other Reviewers, It Took Me A While To Appreciate","after i read the early reviews of this cd, i bought a used copy because I was worried it would be a waste. But I will tell you that this is a fabulous album, that has songs of many genres, but I liked all of them (except one...). It is different than Return of the Rentals, one of my faves. But it's different in a good way. Like Return, it's one of those cd's i can listen to nonstop for hours. But give it time, it took me 5 listens to get into it."
5,The Rentals have done it again!yeah!,"This new album is just as good if not better than Return of the Rentals. If you liked Friends of P. you will like this, more!"
1,Huge disappointment,"Matt sharp,why did you make a britpop record? The rentals were once one of my favorite group,with such delicious b52s pastiches like the first album's songs...now it this group is just another blur or suede..."
3,Not what I thought it would be.,"After waiting anxiously for this latest release from the ever jubilant Rentals, I have to say I was pretty disappointed. Though there are several songs that I enjoy listening to, I can say that I can't remember the last time I put the CD into any CD player I own. Compared to ""Return of the Rentals"", which is peppy and electric, with the incorporation of the glory that is Moog, Petra Hayden's luscious voice, and music that makes you want to just jump around, ""Seven More Minutes"" is slow and awkward. The perfect music to listen to when you are hungover and depressed. Good songs? Yes: ""Getting By"", ""The Cruise"", ""Barcelona"", and ""Keep Sleeping"" are filled with classic Rentals sound, but also express the progression of their music. Other songs, well, as ""Keep Sleeping"" expresses - ""try, try to stay awake,...""."
2,"It's not a total loss, but...","the guy who made the comment about the euro-raver chic or whatever was right. This is an utter disappointment. Matt Sharp has always been a self centered rockstar (did you see him mugging on Weezer's Pinkerton tour?) and now he steps into the boots fully by calling all his britpop buddies to come and make this just a grand old party. Don't get me wrong here, I like Elastica and I like Blur, but Big Daddy C? What the hell? Just one of the ridiculous moments on this album. The Rivers Cuomo-penned track is sadly lacking, as well. It's not that artists aren't allowed to make an album different from the previous one. It's quite a generalization to say that that's what critics of ""7 More Minutes"" mean. Matt can make any kind of album he wants. He chose to make a bad one."
3,ehh its ok,"Everything that made ""Return of the Rentals"" good is not in ""7 more minutes"". I was very dissapointed with this cd. I got ""Renturn of the Rentals"" last summer and that was my summer album, I listened to that cd for months and I didn't get tired of it. When I got ""7 more minutes"" I listened to it for a week and then I put it up. There are only a few songs that I like on this cd. Keep Sleeping is my favorite, but if I do listen to the cd I have to skip a lot of songs that I just can't stand. But all in all this album is ok, but no where near as good as ""Renturn of the Rentals""."
4,"Needs more moogs, but still great.","If your expecting a carbon-copy of ""The Return of the Rentals"", forget it. This album is much different. However, it is still quite good. My only concerns are the lack of moogs which made earleir Rentals so catchy, and the fake british accent Matt Sharp is going with."
4,Solid release.,"This album sounds like what it is, another Rentals album. It does sound like Matt Sharpe changed his singing style though. He's ditched that robotic monotone sound for the more 'glam goo-goo doll' breathy vocals. But that's really my only complaint. The first 2 tracks start out right where ""return of the rentals"" left off. I'm not really a fan of this kind of music, but it's definately a good release. A solid effort by a solid band. Is it just me, or is ""Barcelona"" a pixies out-take? And i mean that as a compliment >;-)(velouria, bossanova, cecilia ann, barcelona? maybe it's just the song title) If you ever get the chance to meet Matt Sharpe, ask him to do his Morrissey impression. That's some funny sh*t!"
5,Fabricadabra is Material Magic!,"I am first most a rubber stamper and have found that if it stays in one place long enough it must be stamped on! Sandra McCall's projects are easy to follow, easy to reproduce, and they are elegant and classy.This DVD is a superior quality craft video. I own tons of craft videos and it is refreshing that the sound quality is pristeen (I've had tapes that the first time you play them the sound is warped from inferior tapes and almost unplayable); the camera closeups and angles are well planned and thought out and Sandra's presentations are easy to follow with clear, concise instructions. The gallery shows tons of projects with links back to the tutorial-project section of the DVD. You will LOVE every minutes of this DVD (even the bloopers are great)!"
2,"Too Basic, Not worth the money","As a long time crafter and fabric artist, I found this to have precious little new information. I expected more from this DVD."
1,Disappointing,"This DVD was disappointing. This is by no means a steel cage death match, not that I would want to see one. Nor is it a particularly good boxing DVD. The disk contains various girl fights, some of them within a ring on a set and other set up, ad hoc, in people's back yards. THe fighters are unattractive and the men behind the production are obviously exploiting them. It is pretty sorry, over all. If there was even one good fight, or at least one beauty and the beast (promoters love a damsel fighting a beast, where everyone can cheer on the beauty; no such luck here.)"
2,Not exactly what I was expecting,"It could definitely be me, but I was actually expecting it to be in German. It was a horrible price to pay for a surprise of an English text!"
5,best book of kernel methods,"It is the best book on kernel methods. It covers a wide range of subjects.The best thing is that after finishing one or two basic chapters, you can read the rest of the book in any order; most chapters are almost independent to each other. At the beginning of a chapter, the authors list the prerequistites, so a reader knows whether he will be able to understand the chapter.For now the book still reflects the state of art. But it is a fast changing field. I hope the authors will update the book in the future."
2,S.BURLEY'S REVIEW,"AS A TRUE FAN OF EVANS WORK WITH A COLLECTION OF 30 PLUS ALBUMSFEATURING THE GREAT PIANIST AS LEADER OR SIDEMAN I WAS RATHER DISAPPOINTED IN THIS RELEASE. THE THING THAT STRIKES ME FIRST ABOUT THIS ALBUM IS HOW AWFUL THE PIANO AND DRUMS ARE RECORDED(THE WORST SOUND QUALITY OF ANY EVANS STUDIO DATE I'VE HEARD ).THE MUSIC IS FAR FROM ESSENTIAL. NONE OF THE SONGS STAND OUT IN PARTICULAR. THE RUNNING TIME OF THE ALBUM IS UNDER 34 MINUTES.IF YOU'RE IN SEARCH OF AN OBSCURE GEM AS I WAS,YOU SHOULD PASS ON THIS ONE."

4,Quick absorbing story!,"Although I do not remember Shakespeare In Love, I do remember I didn't like it. I enjoyed this book well enough but the story didn't have a thicker plot as much as I would have liked. I wish things had worked out between her and Nate but all is well that ends well!"
2,"Nice idea, but...","""My Father Had a Daughter"" is a good, quick read, but falls down seriously in two places. The first is the device of having her run away to London disguised as a boy and playing Viola; like it or not, this is going to make people think of another Viola in ""Shakespeare in Love"" though the end result is slightly different. The second, and greater, obstacle to realism is the fact that it's well-documented that Judith Shakespeare, far from reading and writing fluently, was actually quite illiterate; Samuel Schoenbaum mentions it in his life of Shakespeare, and shows a picture of a document where Judith had made her ""mark"" with someone else signing her name for her. As a romance, it's a good story, but when writing about a real person, a writer shouldn't stray so far from easily-found facts. Surely a good story could also be told about an illiterate Judith, though it wouldn't involve reading her father's plays."
3,didn't hold my interest,"""My Father Had a Daughter"" started out interesting. Then it started to be what felt like a rip off of ""Shakespeare in Love"". I lost interest and stopped reading."
3,My Father had a Daughter,"My Father Had a Daughter is the perfect blend of fact and fiction, which will satify anyone who has ever wondered about the private and personal lives of the famous. William Shakespeare's daughter, Judith, is smart, sassy, and determined but still sensitive and emotional, everything one would guess the child of the groundbreaking playwright to be. Judith is real, she is alive, and it is easy to become engrossed in her emotions, and share her joy, rage, and disgust. From the time she is a young child, through her adulthood, she makes her own rules, yet at the same time, learns to understand the workings of the world and her place it in, never oblivious to her role as Shakespeare's daughter."
5,"An accidental find, an absolute delight!","I found this book in the discount bin in a bookstore on the boardwalk along the Jersey shore. I had accidentally left the books I had intended to read at home and was looking for something to take to the beach with me. I ended up devouring this book cover to cover so quickly that I had to go back for more books. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I liked the writing style and loved the story. I quickly grew fond of Judith and became very invested in how things would turn out for her. It isn't often that I am easily swayed into putting aside the actual life of a real person used in historical fiction. However, we know precious little about the real Judith, and I highly doubt her real story could be more compelling than what Ms. Tiffany has written. A good read, especially for young women with an independent streak like Judith's."
4,Squier goes solo,Happy Blue is for any 'real' fan of Squier.I has surprised too when first put this onbut like someone else said it grows on you.It's just Squier live in the studio with aguitar! Just lay back and picture him playingin your living room without a band. The songRiver is just one of the best things he everrecorded. Happy Blue is just a great bluessong but the surprise is Stroke me! wow!How can a classic be made into another classic?This is not typical Squier but it's still Squier!
4,A new side of Billy Squier,"Glad to see Billy come out with a new CD. Happy Blue is not your typical Squier CD and long-time fans will be surprised by his blues and acoustical talents. Although you may be asking yourself ""Is this really Billy Squier?"", listen to the CD a couple of times and it will grow on you. It is a nice change of pace to most CD's on the market today. I really enjoyed the CD and hope Billy is back."
4,Lady Jane Grey and Christian Perfection,"Let me first say, I enjoyed this book. Improbable as it was, I felt that Lady Jane Grey had a consistently pure voice in this novel. However, the ages of everyone else were a bit skewed- the hero, Richard Stocker is too good to be true, but a good narrator. As the story opens, he is sixteen. I suppose for the story to work he has to be impossibly young. It is pleasant to think that Lady Jane was idolized by a contemporary male. Historical fiction of this period may usually be narrated by a female and it is nice to have a male point of view.The story is a bit of a stretch, but I was able to suspend judgement and devour it. Stocker is appealing, and one can forgive him his self-promotion given the fact of a thoroughly quick rise in status in Tudor England. I guardedly recommend this book."
3,A good story but not historically accurate.,I was disapointed it was not available on Kindle but still enjoyed the book. Her life was a sad story but it was a littleunbelievable in spots. The hero was a little too much but still a enjoyable read.
3,hamster likes it,I really like this addition to my hamster cage but it falls really easily. I'm not sure if I attached the piece wrong but I think the fact that it is falling is not very safe for the hampster
4,Nice addition,"This attached easily to our cage. It is a bit difficult to remove the top, but that is probably best for keeping our hamster inside."
5,Hampsters favorite part of the house!,"We have a cage that has all the snap on accessories.. No matter what we add or change, this Lazy Look Out is the hampsters number one hang out. She spends 90% of her time in it!"
5,An album which puts a smile on your face....,I'm a great fan of Jim Brickman and I've nearly all his albums. This is one of his best work. I don't know how Jim Brickman does it but every song he writes is beautiful & gives you wonderful happy thoughts. Looking forward to his next album.
5,"""A Room for Meditation""",I enjoyed listening to Mr. Brickman's cd especially at times when I need to relax and unwind. We need this kind of music if we need to survive in this stressful world we live in these days. Thank you Mr. Brickman for sharing your talent as a gifted pianist.
5,Taking Jim Brickman For Granted,"Jim's new CD is generating strong sales and reviews. However, some fans have complaints about his latest CD ""Love Songs and Lullabies"". One issue is the 38 minute CD length. I enjoy an artist who can make concise musical statements without feeling the need to fill out an entire 80 minute CD.Interestingly enough, the fact this CD has been released less than a year after ""Simple Things"", has also caused criticism. I much prefer a hard working artist who is building a strong catalog of work to some who are only motivated to release new material every five to ten years.I'm afraid some people assume this is simply the soundtrack to his current PBS special. These are actually studio recordings and are comparable to any of his prior releases. The album cuts are varied yet consistent, a mix of instrumental and vocals. It just goes to show you can't please everybody all the time. I do feel some fans are taking Mr. Brickman for granted."
3,no words...PLEASE!,"I am a huge fan of Jim Brickman's music...HOWEVER...this new release has too many vocals...and only 1 of them is worth the disc space![ ""You"" ]Why do you TRY to sing,Jim? You are very talented ...just PLAY!This is an example of an artist trying to please too many different people...and none of them will stick with him If he strays too far from his roots."
2,"Same old, same old","I'll admit that I have been spoiled by so many great recordings of Jim Brickman that my expectations are high. However, this CD doesn't do much for me. Several of the songs sound way too familiar, as though he re-recorded the songs just to sell another CD. The CD lacks a personality of its own. I'll probably use it as backqround music when I have guests over."
5,Strange as ever.... Never Better!,Never again will there be such a mesmerizing artist as Klaus Nomi. This CD is only so close to capturing the wonder of him. Can't stop listening.
4,Great blues/boogie rock!,"The other reviews are pretty accurate, but I wanted to add that Lonesome Dave of Foghat fame makes a guest appearance singing High On Your Love. As all good Savoy Brown fans know, Lonesome Dave was SB's original rhythm guitarist in the 60s and sang lead vocals on Looking In and the live side of Blue Matter.This album came out when almost nobody was playing this type of music anymore, right in the middle of grunge, it was like manna from heaven for my ears!"
5,It will touch your heart and soul.,"I have this ""album"" (before CD's) and it is so worn from play that I ordered the CD. EXCELLENT! I highly recommend this CD to all people and especially Christians! It will indeed touch your heart and stir your soul."
1,rotten canvas,the canvas lasted about 6 hours before the grommets started ripping out . lesson learned now will only by canvas i can look at before i buy
3,Canvas Tarp,"Ok tarp, a little expensive, shipping was too much and the canvas is a bit thin. Go for a thicker tarp. If you cover anything with somewhat sharp edges it will poke through the tarp."
1,Trash - This is not an example of Brazillian Work,"First of all. I am from Brazil and this was a ""Brazilian production"".But Every Brazilian CG ARtist just hate this production, cause it's a shame for the world to had something like that produced here. Brazil is very strong in Computer Graphics, exporting so much talented artists to around the world, and we have tons of very good artists here. Please, don't consider that production as an example of Brazillian CGI Capacities, this is the worst thing we ever saw on our industry...This Review is just a answer from the Brazilian CGI/Artists and Animators, to alert you, that THIS IS NOT A REPRESENTATION OF BRAZILLIAN ANIMATION CAPACITIES. We don't like that too, and it's not, in any way a sample of our work. We can do any production here, with the same Level of quality of any bigger studio, for sure. So, don't take this trash movie as a sample of Brazillian work. It's not."
2,Best Sex Writing - Not Sexy Writing,"Reading the stories in this book made me feel like I had a front row seat on the lives of various people I wouldn't care to meet doing things I wish I could have spared them. The sex wasn't sexy, nor were the characters in the stories, though well drawn and believable, interesting enough. I normally might find an inside account of the professional sex industry fascinating for instance, but as it is described in Porn Valley Story, I just was glad when it was over. While there were interesting statements about sexual inclinations and preferences of many characters in the book, the writers never moved me to care about them as people.A previous reviewer likened this collection to typical New Yorker stories. I believe this person is correct. There is the same flat feel to these stories as one finds in The New Yorker. If you subscribe to that, you'll love these."
2,Same as Rinaldi Quartet,"Which I had already bought. 'this info should have been provided. It's a good story, however and I do recommend it."
3,Interesting Listening,"Beck is a master lyricist, and this album doesn't dissappoint. I respect the fact that he was so committed to honest performances that he left some obvious and glaring mistakes on the album. The best song is the only one I can't mention here because it's a curse word. Figure it out and enjoy. The album's sound itself is very stark and bleak, as are many of his songs. It's interesting, if not entirely listenable."
2,Beck before he developed his talent,"I love all other albums by Beck but this is not even in the same ballpark as his last four. This is one of those ""roots"" albums where you can hear the earliest indications of work to come but its poorly done. Some people might like the ""raw"" production but I can hear the performance errors. Glimpses of his trademark lyric approach can be found here which offers some entertainment but I'm giving it 2 stars because its that far away from Mellow Gold, Odelay and Mutations (which all deserve 4-5 stars). It feels like Beck wasn't really trying on this one."
2,A dissapointment compared to his later work,I remember hearing Looser Baby and Where it's At for the first time and loving them. I even listened to Odelay and enjoyed the album. This cd just doesn't seem like Beck. It's more country sounding than alternative. Maybe the later stuff just isn't Beck. Still I like his later stuff better. It's much more entertaining and filled with catchy dance tunes that you feel like you are at a ho down. I recommend albums like Odelay and Mutations. But that's just me.
1,"If you like Mutations and Sea Change, well, there is no guarantee that you will like this.","I thought I would probably find something on all of Beck's albumns that I would like. After buying and listening to this one, I am not under that impression any longer. I didn't like a single one of these tunes enough to keep it in my collection. Do yourself a favor and be sure to listen to the samples before you buy this one."
2,not down wit it,"Many serious Beck-o-philes refer to this disk as prime, unadulterated Beck. I think it has more to do with the fact that it's a relatively rare record and they feel cool because they own it, but maybe not. I know people that say the less bells and whistles Beck sticks in his songs the better. But I like those bells and whistles!I also think Beck is a very gifted songwriter, but there's simply not much here that turned me on! I don't own it curently, but I've heard it repeatedly and I just can't get into it. Sorry Beck-o-philes, but I'll definately go for MELLOW GOLD, ODELAY, MUTATIONS and MIDNITE VULTURES, - not this."
1,Can't Take It Any More!,This was the worst beck album ever made some people give it a 5 star sorry i'm not going down the path again no way I don't know what it is but I just can't stand this album!
5,"Take That Foot Out, We've Got Reviewing To Do","Even without the numerous bonus tracks that were slapped onto the album because of it being the anniversary edition this album would still be stupendous. Beck's earlier stuff is very unpolished and lo-fi but that is the charm of his songs... he doesn't take himself too seriously, something the modern Beck has fallen into tenfold.As I said, the original album is great and varied so with the bonus tracks bringing the track list up to 32 tracks, it is well worth the purchase even if you aren't the biggest Beck fan. This could be the product that launches you into his fandom and makes you get his other albums.The bonus tracks provide a neat look at what could've been on the album but wasn't. This product is well worth the money."
4,Expanded Fun,"4 and a half stars. If you are familiar with this CD you know all about its stripped down charms and humor. Sparse arrangements and Becks voice coupled with just a guitar and a little percussion. Its is amazing how even in its barest form Becks lyrics remain funny and interesting.This edition comes as a cardboard digipak with a great inside gatefold of additonal pictures. I loved the original so I was glad that was not changed. Of the bonus tracks Teenage Wastebasket is hilarious, there is Feather in your cap in a different version than on Stray Blues and the Odelay Deluxe. And you also get a 'demo' of Its all in your mind which wound up in a different form on Sea Change. Here in its rawest form it is still affecting. Plus a 'studio' version of One Foot In the Grave which is different than the 'live' on stage version that can be found on Stereopathetic Soulmanure. Overall the bonus tracks expand the variety of the songs from the original CD without changing all of its low-fi charm."
5,Just a darn good CD.,"I bought this CD based on how good Odelay and Mutations were. It did not disappoint me. I loved it. It ranks as his three best along with Midnite Vultures and Odelay. It's pre-popular Beck, but don't worry--he still knew what he was doing before Mellow Gold skyrocketed. Get it: you won't be disappointed."
4,great first album,"beck's first album and also one of the greatest. has a mix of folky songs and a bunch of abstract ones with low voices probably created by calvin johnson(halo benders, dub narcotic). this album is essential if you are trying to understand how beck got the ideas for his following albums. highly reccommended."
5,git git git git on up with that lo fi sound... awww right!,"ya know he's a mighty good leader and this disc proves it right, we go down to the sleeping bags startin' a fire and man that sure ignites, the flame in yr mind, soakin up a real good time and when yr [bottom] is cold just shake it to the sounds of the burnt orange peel, rockin with a fuzz box! ya can't beat beck at his own game, cuz man he's on tha move, but if show up soon, ya sure can groove to the spirit that moves him all the way through hollow log, throwin a line in at the 14 rivers of soul brotha! Can you dig it?! How can you not?! This is the total spiritual vibe! sing it beck, sing it! Tell 'em how it is... the girl dreams, painted eyelids... how can the ladies resist?!?! You got to feel this one folks! Ain't no party like a Beck party cause a Beck party don't have you gettin sick in the morning... it's all here folks, you need this like you need holes in yr head to hear thru!!! peace out."
4,5 Times Less Fats,"I like the subtle taste of Baked Lay's Potato Chips. They are thinner and easier on the bite. They are also more fragile that you see more crumbs inside a bag, no wonder they put more air in it as an added cushion.Compared to the original Lay's, the baked chips has 3% fat compared to more 5 times of the original with 16%. Also, it does not contain trans fat while the original has 6% of guilt on it. The baked Lay's has tad more sodium though. Honestly, nothing taste better than actual slices of fried potatoes, But it is great to have a choice if you are conscious about your health."
4,portion control for munchies,"Since I have become wheat-free, Baked Lays has been my go-to snack (pretzel withdrawal needs a 12-step program, for sure). Keeping me relegated to a single portion is a huge deal, since I can munch my way through the large bags in two days. These are handy for travel, too. Cannot in all good conscience give 5 stars; who are we kidding? There is no nutrition here...only a lack of seriously high-fat chips (even popcorn can claim fiber) Enjoy it for what it is!"
5,A must read for those Interested in the intelligence field,"This is an easy reading book that never seems like lose its focus. For me, it was a book I simply couldn't put down. The history appears accurate and the stories were very interesting. I would call it a very nice bird's eye view of a field that is sadly, a part of the way we must forever do business."
4,This narrative held my interest to the end.,This is a first hand account of a proficient CIA operative from his own perspective. The fact that he was promoted to positions of increasing responsibility attest to his credibility. A most interesting read.
4,Not a how-to manual,"While Allen Dulles played a pivotal role in the US intelligence service, especially as head of the CIA, his book is not a tell-all revelation of the inner workings of a spy agency. It is however a great history of the cold war told from the perspective of a spymaster. He slips in some lingo like ""dead letter box"", but does not really get into the nitty gritty. He covers most of the already public spy stories. If you are studying the period of history from WWII to 1965 this book is a great read with an important perspective."
3,Great information... but incredibly dry.,"It's really all in the title. The information available in this book is excellent, reliable, and backed up with anecdotes and references. However, it's very dense and reads like a bureaucratic report, making it difficult to get through. Definitely not a casual read."
4,Good old book.,"This was written back when the Soviet Union was in full swing, and the author gets his start somewhere between the Boer Wars and World War I. I find the book fascinating as it is a subject I love and it's in the forgotten era of late Imperialism and ending in the Cold War. Great Read from an over knowledged subject matter expert."
4,Very informative,"Great book. More of an autobiography, but very interesting and definitely worth the read for any spook enthusiast or military mind."
3,A bit dated,"A solid book if you are looking for a study of the fundamentals of American intelligence. However, it's very dated."
5,WOW!,"Just when I think I have everthing Jay & Kay ever made, out comes this CD. These guys were famous in the 50s for their wonderful trombone duo. It's a sextet combo, & it sounds like it was made yesterday. The only tune on it I've heard them play before is ""It's all Right with me.""Amazon has a list of samples you can listen to, but, like all Jay & Kay albums it's a 5 star deal.In the original liner notes, let me just quote some of it"" The degree of influence that these two men have had the past several years is large.... And although sometimes their sound sounds indistinguishable.....As a matter of fact, in some of their musical qualities they are almost at opposite ends of the pole.""If you're not familiar with these guys, it's high time you were. There is one error in the liner notes, it's that this is a sextet, not a quintet."
3,Your Perfect Swing,Good book not as good as the LAWS Book. Rehashed alot of the information from the LAWS of the Golf Swing book.
1,Never received the item!,"I purchased this item and had a confirmation email, and I even called the store to inquire about the item. Several days later, while waiting for it to arrive, I received a refund and email stating that they sold my item, which I had already paid for, in their store. So I cannot give an honest review of this item I wanted so badly!"
3,Pontiac's Rebellion,Excellent book! It's one of those you can't put down once you've started it. Definitely worth the read.
4,A fascinating and unique compilation,Some of the finest pop music ever crafted. Chic and fun in a way only French artists could manage. Check out my article on the album:[...]
4,Their masterpiece?,"While I've only heard approximately 50% oF Mecca Normal's recorded output, I believe this short, little LP is there masterpiece. All 11 cuts are keepers and they flow remarkably well considering their broad range of emotion. David Lester and Jean Smith are at their best as Lester improvises warped guitar jangles and thick power riffs under Smith's affected nasal croon. Smith's vocal venom is as lethal as another Smith, Patti Smith. From introspective and brooding selections like ""Throw Silver"", ""Cherry Flowers"", and ""Not Yet"" to bracing and electrifying numbers like ""Held"", ""Once"", and ""Flashlight"", this album begs for frequent listens. Particularly of note is ""Clatter"" which is one of my personal favorites of the duo's fertile collaborations."
4,Kids,I bought the item for young children who were traveling. They liked it. I received it on time. Service was great.
2,Only half good...,"Fatboy just makes a lot of rhythmic noise! Very bad for your heart if you'd ask me. Oakenfield way more melodic. So definitely don't go for the new, but choose the cheaper used"
5,Reserve 150 minutes of your life a day for this!,"What can I say about such a perfect compilation? I wouldn't be able to do it justice. Fatboy Slim's set is full of energy, great for any party. He should have become a surgon with the kind of precision he lays down. From the light ""Summer Samba"" to the ""Psycadelic Reel,"" the first disc kicks, and is very reminicent of the sets he did last summer(Red Rocks anyone?). All this said, Okenfold's set is not over shadowed. His selection is simply orgasmic. He waxes a groove like only he can, and in my opinion is even better than Tranceport. If you like eiter of these artists, even remotely, buy this album. And Relax...You will live longer."
4,Fatboy Slim competing againstr Paul Oakenfold,"As a big collector of Fatboy Slim CD's I was kinda disappointed by the first three songs on the CD, since I expect more of a beat and the classical Fatboy Slim style. I regreted buying the CD, however, I was proven wrong after I listend to it for a second time - and his compilation is really one of the bests on the market. Just don't expect, what you would as a Fatboy Slim Fan, because you won't get it."
4,"Essential Selection, Vol. 1","I did not care for the Fat Boy Slim Cd, not really my speed. However, I truly enjoyed the Paul Okenfold CD. It flows well and is very sexy. My friends have requested to borrow this CD many times over. Enjoy!"
3,a decent attempt,"The thing that inspired me to listen to this cd is the mere artists involved. Paul and Fatboy themselves rank among the best dj's in the business. However, after listening to the two cd's (one designated for Fatboy Slim; the second for Paul Oakenfold), one can clearly distinguish the two tastes. Don't get me wrong, the Fatboy mixes were not too bad, but Oakey does a marvelous job on his cd. I would much rather have the chance to purchase Disc 2 separately because simply put, Paul Oakenfold is a genious at what he does. Check this cd out if you're into Fatboy Slim, even though the tracks don't last long enough to build a tight beat of any sort. Definately check this cd out if you are an Oakenfold fan of any kind. This is worth having just because his talent graces the trance filled tracks of disc 2. 3 stars for me, but Oakenfold may just take it up to 4 or even 5 ...you be the judge."
3,"Good, but nearly nothing is absolutely 5 stars!","First of all, I believe that nearly nothing out there deserves 5 stars. It has to inspire awe to do that, so even the best gets 4. I gave this 3 because the two mixes are disjointed. Do not get me wrong, both DJs are the best today, however the two are significantly different in how they approach this mix.By itself, the Oakenfold mix is 4.5 stars. Its a great flow from one track to another and finishes with Moogwai, the best track to finish with. Also by itself, the Fatboy Slim tracks are pretty good, maybe 3.5 stars on its own. Each track is different but logically placed with regards to the previous track.The main trouble with this set is that the two CDs should not be played one after another. The styles are completely different in treatment of this genre of ""DJ"". I prefer disk 2 by far, and this alone would be worth buying, even at the 2 disk price. But that is the problem, its buying 2 disks when afterwards I really only needed 1."
1,HORRIBAL,Recived this book over a month LATE !! In HORRIBAL condition !! AND WAS SENT THE WRONG BOOK !!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY !!!!!!
2,"Crappy cameras, cheap price...",These cameras are horrible. I purchased a system with 8 cameras and all of them have difference coverage area! There is no way to adjust the zoom so that you can get the coverage you need. I do not recommend this to any one.
4,"Average quality, good value for its price","The picture quality is ok and night vision functioned as expected. The camera's field of view was too narrow and zoom was too far for my requirements as a backyard camera. I had to twist off the lens cover, buy a separate wide-angle fish-eye lens to get the proper coverage. The picture quality suffered of course. I highly recommend that buyers understand how wide an area they need to monitor. Installation was simple and I'm glad that many CCTV cameras are using standardized 12V power cords and BNC to RCA connectors so any DVR/VCR system can be made compatible with a simple adapter."
1,"Interesting toy, no support","Interesting toy, no support. When first installed picture was great both during the day and at night. Picture quality started to break down over time to the point that IR was all but useless. Replaced cameras and had same result. Installation is simple. Don't expect any support or warranty backup from Swann. Swann does not seem to be interested in taking care of their product and our experience was that they were grossly unprofessional. Even getting a phone call returned was a major task.PRO: Inexpensive, easy to install. Interesting toy.Con: Picture quality breaks down over time with IR mode worse than daylight mode. Don't try to ID anything from it as the picture quality is too poor. Don't waste your time trying to get support or warranty service from Swann.Having purchased these units and replaced them twice, if you are interested in any serious level of security or ID go to a better quality unit not Swann."
5,Excellent Cameras,"I'm using 2 of these cameras, 3 Q-See cameras, and 3 Sylvania cmeras. This camera has excellent daylight picture, and good night vision capability from 20-30 feet. The Sylvania cameras have good daylight pictures, but not quite as sharp as the Swann Bulldog. Stay far, far away from the Q-See cameras. They are advertised as having similar capabilities as these, but daylight picture is grainy, washed out, and extremely dark. Night vision was useless. I've got 2 Q-See 4-channel PCI capture cards, which work well."
4,Escaflowne is great...,"Escaflowne is great -- perfect for all ages, adventure, action, romance, intrigue -- and I'd recommend getting it except that I personally find it difficult to shell out $25-30 times 7 or 8 or 9 (whatever it is!) sets of episodes. I wish they'd release the whole series in a set like they did on VHS and then I'd pay for the slightly-reduced cost. Well, maybe that's silly. If that doesn't bother you then get Escaflowne. It pulls the whole mechanoid-fighting genre into a wonderfully engaging storyline.And please, watch it in Japanese with the English subs on! So much better!"
5,PROBABLY THE BEST ANIME T.V. SHOW!,"This is defenetly one of my favorite movies ever! (Well, I know it's not a movie, but it feels like one!) One of the reasons I like it so much is because it is like a blend of about every genre of anime in one! It has fantasy, adventure, swordplay, magic, romance, robot-like armor, and even comedy! It is very fun to watch and makes your mouth water for vol. 2! By the way, I love the title song, ""I Don't Need Any Promises"", and the end credits song, ""Mystic Eyes""! They are sooo cool!"
5,Vision of Escaflowne,"Perhaps one of the best anime series released in recent history. If I could rate this series with 10 stars, I would. Perhaps what makes this series so great is that it is not of one genre. It mixes fantasy, mecha, shojo, and just about anything else you want to think of into 26 episodes of perfection. This series was released around the same time as the much herladed Evangelion, but Escaflowne never disappoints, which I would venture to say Evangelion does.For those who don't know, August 19, 2000 will see the release of Escaflowne on US television on Fox Kids. I think it will lose a great deal in the conversion, but at least it is being seen.Watch it. Love it. You won't regret it."
5,One Kickbutt Animé Series!,"One of the best I've seen, and Fox just had to ruin it all. I downloaded some episodes into my computers, up to 15 so far, and all I can tell you is that IT REALLY RULES! DON'T WATCH FOX'S CRAPPY DUBBED VERSION! WATCH THE UNCUT VERSION! You'll be happier watching the uncut version. There is violence & foul language, but what do you expect from the mecha war story?"
5,"Well Written story, well developed characters, well done","My title for this review says it all. This entire series is well done, not one aspect is a let down (maybe a little unoriginal though). It's for every one, you'll still enjoy it even if you have piticular tasts."
5,Was it all a dream?,"Hitomi,a schoolgirl from Japan, likes to give Tarot Card readings to her friends. But, she discovers one of her classmates is leaving the country. She does a reading and is disturbed that she pulled ""the card of distant separation"" and is baffled by the ""Courage"" card.The classmate is Captain Amano, which Hitomi has a crush on. She tells Amano if she can beat 13 seconds on the track, she would like Amano to give her first kiss with a boy.BUT, a white light appears on the track and suddenly a boy in strange clothing is there. The boy is Van Fanel of ""Fanelia""After Van kills a dragon that comes soon after him, he is sent back to his world...along with Hitomi!Hitomi finds herself on Gaea, a world with the Earth and moon both hang in the sky. Natives of Gaea call the Earth ""The Mystic Moon"" On Gaea, Hitomi has adventures with Van, Merle and other people.Will she ever return to Earth?"
5,This DVD is awesome.,"On this DVD, you get a lot of extra stuff. There are three music videos, which are really enjoyable.The grapics in this show are awesome and it's a funny show. I would recommend this DVD to fans of Sailor Moon and Gundam Wing."
5,Will draw you in and never let go.,"I love this series so much. I own the VHS box set and am slowly starting to collect the DVD's.The animation is breathtaking, lush, unique, and simply wonderful to behold. The music, well, what can I say about Yoko Kanno's soundtracks that has not already been said? The plotline, characters, conflicts, and love triangles are magnificent.There is no describing or explaining this series. It must be seen to be understood, and with every repeated viewing, I am as mesmerized as before. Sure, some of the details get a little cloudy, and you may be left scratching your head at some things, but the entire work is so superb, the ""flaws"" really don't detract from the whole.A MUST SEE for any anime fan."
1,Dubbed - argh!,No Japanese audio track! What were they thinking? A beautiful DVD ruined by English voice (over)actors. Please... save your money until they re-release this video in the proper format.
1,a book on settlers of Maryland,"This book was a total disappointment to me. I ordered it thinking that it would contain stories about the settlers and their lives, but it contained a list of people."
5,This voice deserves so much credit,"For those of you who love diva-esque female vocals, this release is not to be missed. As much as I don't care for remixes, the album version more than makes up for it. Mix powerhouse vocals with the team that gave helped Cher's CD ""Believe"" become one of the biggest albums of her career and you have a guaranteed smash. This will be an artist you will hear about in the near future."
4,I will love again,"Lara Fabian's ""I Will Love Again"" is almost a Cher sound-alike, but is lively, club-style, dance music, that blends the distinctive use of piano and other acoutical instruments to a crescendo that really is pleasant to listen and jam to. It starts off kind of slow, but builds passionately and ebbs and flows throughout the song, with a beat that one can steadily groove to on the dance floor without losing energy. A very good addition to one's dance collection for 2009, even though it's been around prior.Artley Edwards, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, USA."
2,Yukk!,The song wouldn't be bad but her screaming wrecks it! And these singers think they need to scream to be great! I think it's the exact opposite! I think they would be great if they just sang softly!
5,Hex makes the remix to dance,The Hex remix is great for mixing in the dance floor a lot of people enjoy dancing to her voice and beats it really a cool record. she also looks hot.
2,Trite and shallow,There's nothing novel about Lara Fabian or 'I Will Love Again.' It's mediocre vocals on top of an infectious dance beat - as if we don't have enough of that kind of thing these days in pop music. A release like this is just another reason why Top 40 radio can easily put one to sleep - as it has been able to do for some time now.
5,The best ball book out there,This book is truly awesome. It is very clear and takes your workout to a new level. For those of you trying to improve strengh and balance you must have this book! I honestly can't say enough great things about this little book...you have to try it for yourself
5,"Simple: If you have an exercise ball, you need this book!","If you plan on using your exercise ball to help you get in shape, then this book is for you. You will learn MANY different exercises to get the most out of your exercise ball investment. Very colorful book, with nice pictures so you have a clear idea on what you are doing, and NOT BORING! Recommended!"
4,practical guide,"Nice little book, accessible to anyone with little training experience. Exercises may originate in classic training programmes for movement muscles (known by gym-goers), but are always adding instability to make them more beneficial."
3,A Good Starting Guide for New Fitness Ball Users,"Ms. Westlake provides a good how-to that covers streching, basic and more advanced exercises. There is a section on safety, which could be increased. As a therapist I recomend anyone using a fitness ball be on a padded surface and an able bodied spotter should be used initially. In other words, do not try some of the exercises on brick or rock surfaces (as pictured), until the technique is mastered - a gym mat may be more appropriate."
2,Good presentation but dated,The book (3rd Edition) has an orderly presentation that builds confidence but there are scattered elements that are factually wrong and thus tear it down.
3,I'm new at this...,"I am new at this video on demand thing. Seems very easy. Now, about actually watching this video, two things I noticed. I found it difficult to ""Pause"". This is a problem when watching an hour and a half of CHESS. My dog will not stand for that! For a beginner, this video seems to move a little too fast. The speed is okay at the beginning, then it gets a little hard to follow. Also, wondering why anyone would make those moves in the first place. Okay, that's about my first 15 minutes of experience with video on demand and chess..... maybe more later when I get some more experience. With on-demand, not chess."
5,1 dope cd,hollow tip brings the flows. i met hi and he is no trick. he comes at u with live flows and sicc beats. buy this cd. ull be happy with it
5,Classic,This Cd is Hard!! This is in my opinion Hollow tip at his finest. Every song slumps and every word is G. this is the best cd to ride to because Hollow just straight puts it down for an entire cd. buy this if you dont have it. This is a CD that put Sac On The Map!
4,Good,"I like it. This is simply a good movie. It fills with exciting scenes. The movie takes place on many countries including New York, New York in the US. For the acting, Matt Damon always rocks as Jason Bourne and this time is no exception. For the direction, it is all make sense. For the visuals, it rocks all the way. Overall, a great movie."
3,Action packed movies.,I thought the movie was boring didnt see very much action other two movies were better than this.
3,That's it?,Predictable and uninspired. The plot is weak and took some lame turns. I suppose the only good think abou the movie is that it answers the open questions about Jason Bourne's identity and how he became what he is. The other movies were better.Not recommended.
3,The Bourne Chase,"Though extremely well made, ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is basically one long globe-hopping chase. At least Matt Damon proves he can handle the grueling task with considerable skill. This sequel lacks the narrative depth of its predecessors, yet succeeds as a slick action-thriller. It will be interesting to see the next chapter in the Jason Bourne saga."
3,"Great Movie, Bad Cinematography","What a fantastic, action-packed film. A great group of characters, well-acted, great special effects. The camera angles were intentionally choppy and disjointed. Very uncomfortable to watch. I wanted to see the hand-to-hand fight scenes, but the filming (designed to make it ""feel"" like a fight) obscured everything. That made it less enjoyable. A+ for all but the filming, which was a C-."
4,"This is crappy case idea, but the movie rocks!","I picked this up on tuesday at target, and let me just say i could have saved 8 bucks if i would have just bought the regular dvd! This so called ""Limited Edition"" is merely just the regular $16.99 version with a horrible looking faded gold case and a tiny booklet called TOP SECRET Bourne Ultimatum files. There is nothing new in the files booklet, just some of the characters from the movie and a couple of fight moves. Just buy the regular dvd and save yourself some money. Anyway, this movie is by far the best movie ive seen this year. Two Thumbs Up! Love all the key elements to this film. Matt Damon is awesome. Get It!!!"
4,Bourne Ultimatium,Saw this in theaters and bought the dvd. Give it 4 out of 5. It's pretty much the same as the other 2 movies.
1,Can't Play on my Sony DVD Player,"It might well be a good movie, maybe not. I wouldn't know because like Ocean's 13, my Sony DVD player won't play it! My cheap DVD player will, but not my good one. It will play on my computer too, but not my Sony DVD player. Am I the only person this has happened to?"
3,Overhyped,"Not as much action as I was led to expect from the many glowing reviews, it starts off kind of slow, for a substantial part of the movie. There's also a slow chase section in the middle where his pre-Bourne girlfriend (or not) is running from an assassin. The rest of the action, however, is good but often seriously marred by the overused jerky-cam filming which makes the action unintelligible. It's a cheap and silly technique that has to die, and soon. When you consider how much effort, training and planning goes into these action sequences, it's just dumb to obscure it by wobbling that camera as much as they've done here. Also, why does he never wear a disguise, walking around in public with impunity?All in all, I'd say Live Free or Die Hard was a better action film."
3,Ultimate disappointment....,I thought we ended this part of Jason's life already. This one didn't really much to the story. The shaking and whirling of the camera hurt my eyes and made me strain so much that I ended up getting a headache! It was okay as action films go but I didn't see what all the fuss was about. Bourne #1 was the best so far.
1,Bad Rental -- Motion vs. Compression == Bad,"This has to be the worst rendition of a rental service. Downloading this movie via TiVo and amazon.com Unbox makes me feel this is the worst idea ever. I was rejoicing in the idea, but on a 60"" Sony screen delivering 720p, this movie should have made me feel like I was there. This made me feel like I had wasted the $4.00 and will be unsubscribing from the service immediately. The ""widescreen format"" turned out to be only 1/4 of the screen size, and *any* motion within the movie caused ghosting, creating a big headache for watching. I'm sure this is at least a good movie in content, but in the end, it's in the quality of the end product."
1,"Very slow, very disappointed",I pre-ordered this item a month before release. In the past it came right when release was expected. However this time it was ONE WEEK late. I had to go buy a copy in a regular store.Would not order again via Amazon for a nice movie being released on DVD.
2,Not In Blu-ray,"It's a shame that this, and the other two films in the series, are not available in Blu-ray. I'd defintely buy it then. Otherwise, I'll refrain from buying it in DVD, and certainly won't purchase it in this format. One day, when this stupid format war is over, then we can all buy one format and be assured that our purchases won't become obsolete in a matter of months."
5,Loved the movie,If you liked the first two Bourne movies you will love this one as well. I hope they continue to make these great movies.
1,"caution, may cause epilepsy","The cinematography in this film is laughable. It is filmed in such a manner that you are made to believe you are in the action...not a bad concept, however the execution here is awful. the screen is so violently unstable, it is near unwatchable. I actually did get a laugh noticing that in a situation where you would expect screen movement, there is none and vice versa. In an intimate moment between the two leads, the scene is shot from several angles including the closet, hall ect. The camera is shaking as if a child who ate too much sugar is holding a handheld, hiding in the closet. Conversely, a scene shot through a snipers scope (where you might expect a little screen movement) is so steady I did chuckle. The movie gets one star from me for some good fight sequences. My advice, spend your money elsewhere, or rent it if you loved the books."
2,"Driving backwards off a parking garage, crashing and walking away? Oh, I don't think so...","This one really pushes the implausability meter. I mean, initially it works, and I'm with it. But when we get up to to the sequences of ""jumping off a roof through windows and landing perfectly"" then the serious doubts start to manifest.Great, breath-taking action and jerky cinematography (but would it have killed them to mount the camera, just once, for just one still scene?)The big payoff at the end was sortof a dud. I won't give spoilers here but... that's it? That was the big three-years-of-running, three-film secret?I dunno. Not much of a payoff. Now Bourne vs. 6-7 super-soldier guys in hand-to-hand.... that would have been cooler.Thumbs down if you need to, but I bet you thought the same thing..."
2,Poor quality for HD,Watched it on kindle fire hd.Mulitple fast scenes were blurred and wavy.Other scenes appeared faded and grainy.I assume it was the DVD and not a problem with the Kindle Fire HD...who knows.Sorry...
4,The Bourne Ultimatium,"This is a go-to molvie for me. once a year or so I want to watch it again...great chase scenes, even if a bit over the top-very touching scene at the end...perdictable but still good action movie."
4,Great movie,"We really enjoyed watching all the movies in preparation to the last one, they all are as good as when we went to the movies"
4,Great movie,The Bourne Ultimatum is must watch movie for me. The movie is great and entertaining to watch. However it lacks something for me to give it five star.
3,Dumb Move Bourne,"Why did Bourne tell the section chief (Noah, I think his name was) that he was in his office robbing him? Though the end could have been the same (they tracked Bourne to the alternate address based on information independently derived), it wouldn't have required the New York car chase. In my opinion, the movie would have been better without it. On its own, this movie deserves two stars, but since the movie is necessary to conclude the Bourne series, and I'd give the first move 5 stars, it is propped up by it predecessors and earns a third."
2,"Good Movie, But HD side not working",Great Movie. But only the DVD side worked and the HD side did not work
3,good movie but what is with the awful camera shots,"This is a good movie, but you get motion sickness watching the dialogue. The ""artistic"" motion of the camera looks like the person holding the camera was drunk and gets extremely distracting making it hard to watch"
2,Would have been OK if not for 2 major flaws,"Not a bad thriller, but this film has two major problems:First, it is filmed with a ""modern"" shaky effect that gets tiring after a while.Second, there is (to my taste) a major scenario bug: without giving up the end, there is a moment when Bourne is on the phone with his worst CIA ennemy after Bourne managed to lure that guy and his minions out of their building on a false pretext. At that point, the super pro and efficient Bourne decides to tell his ennemy where he is, launching a 10 minutes chase episode. Why on earth would Bourne feel he has to give up his location ? There is ""some"" credibility (that is to say, if you agree to go along with the genre) in the rest of the movie, this kills it."
3,ok,Couldn't really get into the movie and was a bit disappointed with have to wait and hour or so to see if it had downloaded yet.
1,Shock,Was waiting to write a review as I did not remember if I purchased from Amazon on from one of your contributors. Purchased over a month ago and just placed in my DVD shelf. We finally had a free evening a few days ago and dcided to watch it. What a surprise there was no DVD in the sleeve. Just put it aside because I did not know where to complain.
5,could have been good,"This movie might be good. unfortunately my house was burglarized and it among 350 other movies were stolen. I will get it again,if that means anything"
3,"movie might be good, but the shipping isn't","I couldn't tell you if the movie is good because I haven't recieved it, even though it released two weeks ago and I pre-ordered it."
3,Jerky,"The downloaded movie is jerky, during fast chasing scenes. Almost blurred. The plot israther thin, but good action. It took a long time, for Borne to recapture his memory.The whole movie was rather dark and badly lighted. But, he gave good performance."
5,Bourne 3,"This is a fantastic way to end the run of Matt Damon's time in these movies. They did really well with wrapping his story line up, and the movie is just as good as the previous 2. Fans will like this one, if you haven't seen it already, I'd definitely recommend you do it. Make sure you watch the 2nd one first, though, just round the whole experience out."
4,Good movie..Great service,Thoroughly enjoyed the movie until it couldn't play anymore. Mailed it back and within 2 days I had a brand new one in hand. I appreciate that type of service.
4,The Bourne Ultimatum,A very well done movie with plenty of action and suspense. Edge of your seat thriller. You really understand Bourne's identity and background in this movie.
5,Great!,Being the last movie in the series it is all the one would expect for the final show down. Highly recommended!!!!
5,A great 3rd,"The Bourne Ultimatum (Widescreen Edition)All three movies in the series were excellent, but I believe this one was the best of the three. A fine way to end a great series of movies."
5,XBOX 360 HD Drive users....Just press OK on the remote.,"I was upset that the HD side of the dvd didn't work. I even though that it was defective and sent it back for another one and the new didn't work either. I so PO I was ready to just give up...until I came across the person who said that using the XBOX 360 HD DVD drive just press OK on the remote and it should work. It can't be that simple right....well I tried it and worked perfectly, so I wacthed the movie again in HD this time and enjoyed every minute of it!!!! Thank's for the help and I hope this may help someone else."
3,"PAUL GREENGRASS, OPUS 5","**1/2 2007. Directed by Paul Greengrass. If hysterical editing and a tremulous camera are your cup of tea, this movie could please you. No second degree here, no artistic ambition, just popcorn cinema. Already forgotten."
5,"Bourne to Tangier, MICHAELmATICIAN to Algiers","Jason Bourne goes all-out in this film, and finally discovers why he's a deadly Frenchman. From Berlin to Moscow, then Tangier, back to London and even Madrid, Bourne tells it like it is. It is quite surprising that he didn't cross paths with MICHAELmATICIAN (often in Algiers). Bourne spends a few nights on Coke binges and other nights trying to uncover the conspiracy that created him and his new identity.This is a film of boundless action and international intrigue, it is the stuff that nightmares are made of. Director Paul Bluegrass does a superb job of delivering a gritty yet concise view of a world divided by borders and McDonalds franchises covered in blood. Jason Bourne has no problem overcoming trained assassins and mercenaries, but continues to struggle with cell phone reception. The pacing is such that Bourne hasn't a chance to eat, sleep or shave. This film is a must see for the citizens of Algeria.2.342"
5,One of the best,"It is one of the best action movie of this era. I would recommend. Matt is a superb actor, who gave the movie class."
4,Ultimate Ultimatum!!!,"From the East to the West to everplace in between, Jason Bourne leaves no stone unturned in his search for his past. He has new adversaries - ruthless government officials that have used America's war against terrorism as an excuse to revive Treadstone and kill anyone they consider a threat. The action is non-stop, the suspense intense. A satisfactory conclusion to a satisfactory series.JASON BOURNE RULES!!!"
2,Poor packaging,"The movie is great. The disc, however, is poor. The case is one of the worst I've come across with the locks and the center retention being far too tight. The disc is plain with little to no graphics. It's like they gave up on the normal DVD packaging because they released a high-def version. The extras were okay.Movie = great, everything else = mediocre."
1,Do not get ripped off..!,"The movie itself is a good conclusion to the trilogy, but do not download it from Amazon Unbox. Drive to the video store, walk if you have to, but don't try to watch this heavily compressed version of it. As the other reviewer said (and I wish I had trusted them) the high speed motion which is an essential part of this action movie is made unwatchable by the video compression artifacts. It's not even like other high speed mpeg artifacts I've seen such as those on digital cable where everything goes blocky - this is like true ghosting like early LCDs. I tried to watch this on a 43in plasma TV and it was awful. Every time something moved quickly there were two or three overlapping versions of it.Take the advice of these reviews - don't buy or rent this movie as a digital download. It might only be $4, but it's $4 wasted."
3,The Bourne Ultimatum,I enjoyed the first two episodes in the Bourne movie saga and so was disappointed with this third (and presumably final) episode. The clarity of the audio was very bad and one needed sub-titles to learn what was going on. I expected a lot of car chases and jumping off buildings but there was hardly a gap between stunts so that the action lost credibility and I lost interest after 30 minutes into the movie. I was unable to access a menu which was another frustration.
1,Bourne Ultimatum - HD DVD 2 bad discs,I have yet to see the end of the movie.Two HD DVD discs have both been defective.Disc freezes and will not continue playing.Amazon have been very good - am waiting for third disc!!!!
2,So many chase scenes it's tedious,"The movie is 70% chase scenes, 10% fights and 20% dialogue and plot. If you like action movies and don't care about plot, character development or acting, you will love this film."
2,Some good action scenes + Big illogical holes = Worth watching once,"It has some good action scenes. However, the movie is completely ruined for me because it contains big illogical holes. For example, when Bourne and Nicky tried to evade the assasins, Bourne never wore disguises. The movie showed cameras in the malls, and in the streets recording movements of everybody. Nicky had to dye her hair to look different. Yet Bourne did nothing. He did not even wore sunglasses! And the CIA could not catch him!In another scene, the local CIA chief, tried to save his life by making a run for another country after being found out he had leaked top secret information. While doing this, he's using the passport with his real name!Yeah right! Please be reminded that he's a CIA local chief.This kind of movie is good because it's thrilling and it's brainy. It makes you think. This movie insults your intelligence. I found the first installment was more thrilling.This film's worth watching once."
1,"Good plot, poor camera work","The third installment in this trilogy had a good plot, although a bit disappointing to me at the end.After watching this movie I had a headache from watching the hand held camera bounce around in all of the action scenes throughout the movie. It was very irritating trying to follow the action when the camera was constantly bouncing around. I would have rather had them spend the extra cash that is required to film scenes using cameras on tracks, etc. which would have given the movie more clarity, especially in the fight scenes which Matt Damon handles so well."
2,An So SO movie at best..,"In the movie during a fight scene, the technique of the ""tumbling/jerky camera"" is used - made me a tad motion sick. A great movie - no.. A good movie - no.. A so so movie - okay. For people who like implausible movies, they will love this movie. After awhile, the negativity becomes really annoying. A so so movie overall in my opinion."
4,bournie,a nice conclusion the the Bourne Series. could have used a little more imagination on the ending.
4,Bourne Ultimatum,This is an action packed movie (series) and will keep you on the edge of your seat!
4,Bourne is back and exciting as ever,"Bourne is back for the third installment of the series. If you haven't seen the first two, they aren't necessary, but I would highly recommend them. In this episode, Bourne is more reflective as he tries to piece together his past. The reflection does not last long before chase scenes and fighting sets in. The story is good, as are the action sequences. I enjoyed it thoroughly.While the action genre is not my favorite, I do enjoy an occasional action show. And since my brother had a new surround sound stereo to go with his new big screen, it was an ideal time to enjoy. I think that if you view them in moderation, they are much better individually."
3,Bourne Ultimatum,This was a let down from the first two in the series. It looks like they had to get something out and did not think it through properly.
2,Motion-sickness,"I love the Jasom Bourne films so much, and I couldn't wait for this to come out in the theatres... but the crazy camera-running-after-the-action-scenes causing the constant bumpy image seen through most of the last half of the movie made me stop watching the movie while in the theatres. :( It was horrible, and it took me a while to be able to continue to watch it. I don't mind the occasional shakiness, but this film's camera men ruined this otherwise fantastic movie! :("
1,Here come the errors...,"My PS3 works fine. This ""flip disc"" contains the DVD on one side and Blu-ray on the other. This Blu-ray WILL NOT PLAY IN MY PS3.Unfortunately I've already purchased the whole individual collection and now must return it to Amazon."
2,Poor direction ruins a potentially good story,"The bourne trilogy seemed to devolve as it went. Bourne Identity was the best, Supremecy was good and Ultimatum disappointed. I look at the direction as the principal flaw in the 3rd film. Jittery hand held camera shots, too many jump cuts too frequently and a ping pong between extreme close ups and long range shots. Whatever happened to setting up a couple cameras at a normal distance to clearly follow the action? Matt Damon was good in the role as was most of the cast, but for me the poor direction really detracted. This isn't a movie I anticipate ever watching again."
5,The Bourne Ultimatum,"Jason Bourne (Damon) is still searching for his true identity, and is once again becoming a thorn in the side of the CIA. Noah Vosen (Strathairn), head of black ops targets him for elimination, and soon he is on the run again. This time around agents Pamela Landy (Allen) and Nicky Parsons (Stiles) are on his side, offering their assistance to stop the darker aspects of the CIA as well as help him find himself.""The Bourne Ultimatum"" is an excellent action movie, and a fitting end(?) to the Bourne trilogy. The best of the three and the best threequel of the summer, ""Bourne"" is nonstop action with a smart story. Matt Damon falls back into Bourne's shoes easily, and the supporting cast is once again top notch. The ""Bourne"" series has delivered top notch stories and action from the beginning, and it would be a shame if it didn't continue beyond this point. This is one of the best action trilogies ever made. I highly recommend this film."
5,"Fast paced, action packed, and plot!","Rarely now do you actually see a good action movie, that has actual plot and isn't just about the next big explosion. I have watched this movie twice now and it continues to be better every time I watch it... mostly because there is SO much going on that you have to watch it a few times to catch all the details! Definite buy!"
2,Geared Toward Dim-Wits,"with a 5-second attention span. I'm glad I didn't actually pay to see this thing. It's suitable for anyone who thinks on a fifth grade level and doesn't concern him/herself with realism. Amazing how everyone in this movie is almost clairvoyant and knows everything everyone else is doing and where they are on the world map. It's as though everyone has the omniscient power of God. Further, as in a lot of these phoney action movies, a lot of people (mainly Matt Damon) apparently have the stamina of Olympic long-distance runners, since they run, jump, dive, etc. for lengthy periods of time without getting much winded. And, of course, one can jump multiple times through glass windows without getting cut. George Smiley, where are you?"
1,"cut,cut cu-t, c ut spl ic e","Only one thing to say about this debacle. While I really liked the first one, the new director and editor have screwed this into a cocked hat. I began counting the edits in the film about 15 minutes in. I gave up during one of the many fight scenes when I finally couldn't keep count. In a slow scene you might actually get one that's 7 seconds long! In the fight scenes the edits come so fast and furious - they're in half seconds or 12 frames. The longest I was able to count was about 2 seconds long, and that was an exception.So, the fights make no sense. We just see bodies in motion. If you turn down the volume, its ludicrous at best. BOO!! Two sequels ruined by this crappy techinque of substituting action with frame to frame editing! Even MTV never got this bad!"
3,Shaky Camera,"What's with the shaky camera ??It's crazy..it takes away from the film,blurred,shaking.Plus,do you think they could have done away with oh perhaps 20 less guys shooting at him at one time ??Please !That's what is so good about the Bond films,it pits much less activity atone time and adds to the suspense.I mean,this guy is good but to fist fight with 15 guys at one time getsto be just ridiculous.Disappointed with this film.I would have forgiven the second gripe but the shaky camera was justplain poor film making.Plus to really show how bad it was..the second movie I watched was 3:10 To Yuma. That movie was stunning with the filming. It made the first onereally stand out against the blurred,shaking mess."
5,Non Stop Action,Although it helps having seen the other two Bourne movies. This one is an outstanding action adventure from the very start. You will literally be glued to your seats.
4,Back For More,"In The Bourne Ultimatum, Jason Bourne is one movie closer to discovering/remembering who he was before becoming a lethal killing machine.Back for more is:Matt Damon, Julia Stiles and Joan Allen. Adding to this movie's cast is all-time-greats David Strathairn and Scott Glenn.Similar to the first 2 films, the government agencies are trying to hunt down and eliminate Bourne's threat.Bringing back the vicious hand-to-hand combat scenes along with dizzying chase sequences, The Bourne Ultimatum is a perfect culmination for this trilogy.But then I heard there are rumors of a 4th movie possibly being ready for 2010 (but we'll have to wait and see)Just one bit of trivia about this movie: Matt Damon never smiles in this film. Ever. The only smile we see is during a flash-back. Guess if you've been hunted for a while, you'd be somber too."
5,What's the title?,"I gave this movie a 5 star rating because I really liked it.Unfortunately,I was really ticked off because I expected thereto be SOME relation to the book.Other than the title,this moviehas nothing to do with the book whatsoever !!!I hope that they will make a movie of the book titled The BourneUltimatum some day, because it has a really good story."
3,Encoding Issues!,"I'm sure this is a great movie, unfortunately I couldn't watch more than a few seconds without getting motion sickness! This is the second movie in a few months that I have downloaded which had some kind of encoding issue or something similar. Every time the camera moves quickly, the screen blurs slightly and it creates a really unviewable movie. Anyone else seen this issue with Unbox movies d/l to TIVO boxes?"
3,"Good story, shaky picture","I enjoyed this story and the acting was good enough not to detract from the storyline. The action scenes are very hard to truly enjoy since the director would zoom in for a close-up making it impossible to see what was going on. Combine the inappropriate close-ups with the ""fad"" of shaky cameras and I'm really glad I did not pay full price for the DVD. It also reinforces why I don't see movies in theatres anymore. This director is now on my list of not worth the money movies."
3,"Ho, Hum","This was mainly a ""chase"" movie - many good chases, but too many in all made it tedious toward the end - and another unresolved ending to boot! The plot was thin, though the director did well with a very weak script.The Bourne movies need an end - no more sequels."
1,A warning to all thinking of buying this film on DVD!,"***WARNING***This is a warning to all the people thinking of buying or renting this film: the whole movie is done with a hand-held camara. It makes watching this film painful and dizzy. I couln't watch more than 20 minutes of this film and then I got a real bad HEADACHE. Please be aware of this because no matter how great this movie is, the ""jiggly"" effect just makes this movie a real pain on the eyes.What a shame! who thought of making this movie with a hand-held camera?"
4,great delivery,"This product arrived on time for me to put in my Son's stocking for Christmas, and he loved it."
5,Outstanding Movie!,"This movie turned out to be a classic. In this most recent Bourne moviewe start where the last movie left off. Bourbe is quickly making hisescape from Moscow. He once again arrives in Europe. Upon his arrival heis pursued by CIA assassins. They fail in their goal to kill the everelusive Jason Bourne. There are wild gun battles and nonstop chase scenesin his European stay. He and a female companion escape Europe and returnto New York. He immediately has to dodge CIA assassins. Once again youhave blazing gun battles and high speed car chases. Bourne finally learnsof his past. He finds out his real name(David Webb),and how he became aTreadstone assassin. He also is able to discover a CIA conspiracy thatinvolves the killings of American citizens. The powers that be go all outto cover this secret conspiracy before it becomes public. Excitement fromstart to finish. Be sure to see this movie. It is one of the better filmsto come out."
3,"Good Movie, Problems With DVD Quality",I really enjoyed the film...however the DVD quality is very poor. I have had to replace the DVD twice due to problems with the movie freezing (did verify the problem was with the disc by playing on two different DVD players)
5,Another great Bourne movie!,"This movie is action packed from beginning to end! It is very well directed with many talented actors. There is no dull moment in the entire movie. The car chasing scene in New York City was amazing, but, in our opinion, not as spectacular as the Moscow chase scene from the 2nd Bourne movie. The bonus feature on how the movie was made was equally entertaining. Great dvd to add to your home movie collection."
1,I hate Amazon,I love The Bourne Sieries.....Rate them a 5 Buy the DVD Do not watch it via Amazon.Video on Amazon stops and starts unexpectedly. Worse than commercials
1,Defective out of the box,"I should have heeded the warning of another reviewer who tried to install this scanner on a Dell XPS with a dual core processor. After being up all night and installing and reinstalling the scanner software innumerable times, I gave up and returned the Microtek i900 to Amazon. Not only would the scanner not preview or scan anything, including documents, photos, transparencies or negatives (I tried them all), but it made such a thunking, jackhammer-like racket that my husband threatened to divorce me if I did not return this very disappointing piece of equipment immediately. As soon as I get my refund, I'm ordering the Epson 4990 -- it's cheaper and hopefully will actually work straight out of the box."
1,"But, what If it worked out of the Box","Can only give 1 Star - it did not work out of the box.No Lamp light, no carriage movement, and sort of looked like somebody blotted their pink lipstick on the mirror.Had high hopes, if it had just worked.Maybe this was one in 10,000, maybe."
3,Microtek Flatbed Scanners,"Please note: I purchased a somewhat different model - 6100 Pro - over 1 year ago. I was unhappy with the purchase from the onset and have subsequently purchased a Canon 8400F ... a great scanner.The Microtek took very good scans from photos and film (35 mm slides). However, it rarely worked. It failed to recognize my computer and when I finally achieved a good scan it just stopped. Eventually, I convinced Microtek to replace the scanner however, the same problem recurred. I tossed the Microtek and bought a Canon.I could not recommend Microtek for a mid level flatbed scanner. In addition their customer technical service department is courteous, but they are almost impossible to contact.If you want a flatbed scanner in the $250 to $500 range you should look elsewhere."
1,Inadequate Software for new MACs,MAC USERS TAKE NOTE!!!The OCR software is only compatible with OS 9 and has not been updated for newer MACS that no longer ship with legacy software. THANK YOU AMAZON for an easy return policy.
1,decent scanner - terrible service,"Mikrotek is not helpful with problems. The scanning is good but it keeps loosing the connection to the scanner. No help to be had from Mikrotek. I had to repeatedly reconnect the cables and when I am in luck it decides it is connected. But a lot of the time it decides it is not connected. After two years I upgraded to Mac OS 10.8 and Microtek has discontinued drivers and won't support OS 10.7 or 10.8 so it won't work. So I have to thrash a perfectly usable 600 scanner because the manufacturer refuses to support their own product! Not very green. I shall not buy Microtek in the future because you can't trust they will update their drives for new operating systems. What a waste of 600, what a waste of electronic equipment."
5,Delighted,"I selected this product because I needed a new scanner and wanted one that could scan my large collection of 35mm slides as well as prints and documents. I have scanned a couple of dozen slides so far and am very pleased with the results. The color is true and the resolution allows for good detail. The software includes Adobe Photoshop Elements, which I had not used before, but I'm finding it easy to pick up. I'm using that to erase the small bits of dust that my pre-cleaning did not completely remove. I would recommend this product for anyone needing to digitize a large number of slides."
1,Non-existent customer service... avoid Microtek,"I almost bought the i900, but wound up buying the i800 instead. You can read my full review under the i800 page, but basically I've had a pretty terrible experience with this company. My scanner suddenly broke after a couple of months, and the only way to contact their tech support is to wait until they email you back which seems like it takes anywhere from three days to two weeks. My replacement scanner had very dirty glass on the inside surface.It seems like many people are having these same problems. Do yourself a favor and buy another brand."
1,No U.S. Service and No Reliability,"One of my principal reasons for purchasing the i900 was to able to scan 8x10 negatives on a reasonably priced flatbed scanner. Its specifications were superior to others then on the market (the Epson 4990 had not yet been introduced when I bought). Unfortunately, the solenoid that reverses the mirror on the scanning light broke (after warranty, of course) and THERE IS NO SERVICE IN THE U.S.!!! While I might be able to use the scanner for negatives and chromes, everytime I scan there are three colored lines going in the direction of the scan that must be removed by Photoshop, a painstaking, mind-numbing process. There is simply nothing to reocmmend this scanner."
1,Mac Users Beware!,"If you're a Mac user, don't buy this scanner if you want to be able to upgrade, or if you're already running Lion. Microtek has discontinued drivers and won't support Lion, so it won't work. In fact, if I were you I'd avoid them entirely. The scanner has been fine for me, which makes it all the more frustrating that I'll have to get rid of it simply because the manufacturer refuses to support their own product. They deserve to go out of business. I'd like to suggest that you help them and avoid Microtek like the plague."
4,Aluminum Popcorn Scoop,"This well-made scoop has worked well to fill popcorn bags in the teacher's lounge. My only concern is that the handle seems short, so that it doesn't fit comfortably in the hand."
1,Big disappointment!,"I'm raising a bilingual baby, and I was hoping this DVD would be something like ""Baby Einstein"" with a Latin twist. However, what I got was a mediocre puppet show featuring a JalapeNo puppet with a guitar (!!) and boring closeups of a mobile that I could've done on my own camcorder. What a disappointment! My baby loves other DVDs, like Juana la Iguana and Baby Neptune, but this one doesn't hold her attention for more than a minute. Don't waste your money on this DVD!There is a huge market for good Spanish-language DVDs for kids...can anyone come up with a decent product???"
5,My baby and I love this great video!,"Congratulations! We need more videos like this one. My baby loves its image, music and friendly puppets. All of them show her something about my beutiful land- Latin America. As a mother of two, it has been very important to me to raise my children not only bilingual, but also bicultural (most of my family lives in Latin America)and this video has been the only one that has match our expectations. My baby loves it as much as she loves her baby einstein videos. My husban and I are waiting for more videos and materials like this to help us with our goal.It is a great buy!"
1,Not as I expected,"This DVD consists of hand puppets, music and an occasional Spanish word. It covers only colors and shapes. It might be good with a Spanish-speaking adult to guide the child, but It really doesn't do much to teach Spanish. I noticed that one other reviewer had my same opinion. I believe that this DVD is not much better than a home video. I purchased several other products that were much better. Check out other reviews and make your choices. I am returning this product."
1,sure sure,"I purchased the book, ""It's Time To Call 911: What To Do In An Emergency"", at the outragous price of $28.99 because I knew that it was a good tool for teaching pre-schoolers their full names, addresses, phone numbers, and how to react in an emergency. I, previously, used this book in a day care setting with remarkable results. I was able to purchase it then retail for $10.00. It is now unavailable as it is out of print. My intention was to use it to achieve the same results with our grandchildren.The advertisement indicated the book as ""new"". It arrived, well packaged and undamaged, in a timely manner. However, the book was not, in fact, new. It did not appear to be unused and when I attempted to use it, it did not work.Thank you, Amazon, for your very professional manner of completing the sale and delivery of the merchandise.The seller clearly misrepresented the item."
5,Teach About 911,This lifesaving book will teach your child what to do in the case of an emergency. The board book makes sounds when you dial 911.
1,Time to Call 911,"This book is discontinued, I believe, but I did get it about 5 years ago and my grandson learned about 911. Now my granddaughter will have to learn a different way because I am returning this book because even though the seller said it was in perfect condition it didn't work. There is supposed to be sounds as you press the buttons for 911 so they get the idea but it's going back."
5,A good idea . . .,"I am a Preschool teacher and I bought this book because I read in the newspaper about a small boy- age 4 who was given this book from his Grandmother. The boy learned how to dial 911 and more importantly he learned when to dial 911. Well, wouldn't you know it his mother collapsed and lost consciousness- he dialed 911 and saved the day. I personally used this book with my students during fire safety week. They enjoyed it thoroughly and they now know how . . . and when to call 911."
5,Very Good 911 teaching book,"This book help my son with special needs learn and understand about calling 911, I recommend."
3,MUCH WAS UNBELIEVEABLE!!!!!,"This is the first Knief book I have read. I really liked the character, John Caine. An ex-navy seal and about as tough as they come. The book as a fairly good story line and the dirty videos that are mentioned would make a good mystery story. I was turned off by the unbleiveable part about John being dumped in shark infested waters and swimming 10 miles to shore and lived to tell about it. Then later in the book there is a fantastic storm and these two small sail boats continue to hold up and get them close enough to fight and then leave. I don't think so. May read another one but will try to find one used, don't think I want to pay the price of another new one if it is as unbelieveable."
3,Magnum or McGee??,"I was not bored with Diamond Head. Actually it flowed along pretty well. The story was interesting and the characters had substance. My major complaint is the simliarities of John Caine to Thomas Magnum and Travis McGee. An ex-Navy SEAL who hides his life savings in his boat and does favors for friends while commenting on life's mysteries from the pilothouse of his boat, well it's been done before. When the next Caine novel comes out I will give it another try. I only hope Mr. Knief has me thinking of John Caine after I read it and not Thomas Magnum or Travis McGee."
3,"Good start, loses it in the 3rd act","I found the first two-thirds of Charles Knief's ""Diamond Head"" to be a fairly complelling private eye novel. His hero, former Navy SEAL John Caine, is a unique tough guy who can both out muscle and out think his adversaries. The novel is written with considerable wit and style and Knief provides plenty of local Hawaiian color to spice things up. If Caine is a bit too close in lifestyle and personality to John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee, we can forgive him for the tribute.The problem with the novel starts as the climax approaches and it goes from being a gripping private detective story to reading like the script of a Steven Segal movie. The violence goes over the top and plausibility goes right out the window. Knief is hip enough to make Caine's love interest a modern tough woman, but unfortunately he falls into the old girl-taken-hostage-by-the-badguys routine.Overall, not a bad first effort from Knief, but there is considerable room for improvement."
1,Poor man's Andrew Vachss,"A cliched effort. The hero, a charismatic loner who can disable multiple attackers unarmed, yearns for the tough, but beautiful female cop. The despicable villain spills the entire plot points to the hero, but refuses to kill him while helpless preferring instead for a ""Batman"" type of execution. Yeesh. Like a bad TV show.Does not compare to other entries in the genre, like Michael Connolly (""Black Echo""), Dennis Lehane (""A Drink Before The War""), James Lee Burke (""Neon Rain""), ..."
1,Le Vian Yellow Soho,The watch arrived with a dead battery. A new one showed the watch is broken anyway. The chronograph functions would not center or work. Stuck hands. The watch also had many scratchs on the side with the LeVian name. This was a total failure. Still waiting for my money back. It's obvious this was sold and returned without Amazon checking the watch out. More dissapointed in Amazon than the overpriced broken watch.
1,didn't work,I have to say I was very excited about this car. After my son opened it and tried to race with his big brothers all I got were tears. It didn't work. We tried to exchange the car but we couldn't. I have to say the seller was amazing. They credited our card immediately. Great company bad item..
2,Broke and remote didn't always work,I got this for my daughters 1st birthday. Put the batteries in and it was hit or miss as to if the car would even go. Even with new batteries sometimes it would not respond to the remote for hours then all of a sudden work for a little while and again back to not working. And after a few short drops a wheel broke off. I returned this item and will not be getting another. I am vary disappointed.
4,Good For Toddlers,"This is actually better than I expected. I received the car. When it runs, the headlights flash on and off and the hood goes up and down. The chunky remote is just the right size for little hands. It has two large buttons. The blue one has a large arrow on it, and it makes the car go forward. The green button has a circular arrow on it, and it makes the car back up and turn. That's it - very easy to operate. There is no antenna to break off, unlike other remote control vehicles. It does not move overly fast, and it ran just fine on our carpet. The description does say to choose one of the three vehicles. I thought $12.38 was a very reasonable price."
2,Warning! You only get ONE of the pictured toys!,"The picture shows a train, a car, and a helicopter and the description also deceptively makes it sound like you're getting all three, unless you read carefully. In actuality, you're getting one of the three (at random). We ended up with the train.We purchased this as a gift so we haven't had a chance to see how durable or fun it is, but based on the sneaky description I'm giving it two stars."
5,The Shadowy Men are taking music to new and wonderful places,Even professed non-lovers of instrumental music will find their feet tappin' and their minds hummin' when The Shadowy Men On A Shadowy Planet take the stage (or the stereo!) Never has music been this much FUN. Ever!
3,"Standard stuff, but it keeps you reading","After reading books like The Kidnapper and Psycho, you cannot read Firebug and feel a bit let down. I mean I guessed the ending, and to do it on book by a writer respected for his cracker jack twist endings, well it's a little disappointing. But what makes the book worthwhile is Bloch's talent for getting you deep inside the psychotic mind. That alone is worth the price of any admission ticket."
4,Shouting FIRE In A Crowded Paperback,"This feels like a Cornell Woolrich noir potboiler: neurotic hero struggles with weirdos to uncover a mystery. Who's the culprit? Might it even be... HIMSELF?? Bloch is always fun to read, and this gives good pulp value for money-- the stuff about cults (our protagonist's area of expertise) is amusing, and the improbable plot twists (well, plot devices) keep things tumbling along until the finale. Everyone's a suspect! A bit dated (published in 1964), it's still fun-- suspend disbelief and keep tongue placed firmly in cheek while reading."
2,Disappointed,"I am disappointed in this video. Maybe I should have read the fine print better but I thought it would show more arena bullriding and competitions. Too much interviews, not enough action."
5,The real story,"Everyone knows the story of the three little pigs. Or do they? The big bad wolf explains in his own words that all he wanted was sugar, never meaning to eat anyone. This hilarious story, which I find more believable than the official version, is written by Jon Scieszka and superbly illustrated by Lane Smith."
5,The True Story Of The 3 Little Pigs,"This is a book the entire family can enjoy. It is completely hilarious for a children's book. You know how kids get hooked on a book and want you to read it over and over and over again? Well, this is one of those books that you HOPE they want you to read over and over and over again. It is just a lot of fun. I highly recommend the ""Wolf's"" side of the story about what ""really"" happened with the three little pigs. Adorable!"
5,The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs,"For over 200 years we've been told and believed the story of the three poor little pigs and the big bad wolf. Now it's time for the infamous wolf to tell his side of the story. He says that all he wanted was to borrow a cup of sugar to make his dear old granny a birthday cake. He has a terrible head cold, but things go from bad to worse. It ends in the Big House: the Pig Pen. Was he framed? Big and Bad? Could be. Hilarious? Positively! Young and old will enjoy this ""sequel"" to The Three Little Pigs."
5,Sooo much fun!,"As an adult, I love this book even though it was gifted to my 1 year old son for his birthday! I recommend a thick Texan drawl--it busts our kids up!A word of warning to those of you buying for young children. If your young toddler doesn't know the original story of the three pigs, he/she won't get the concept of the wolf having a different perspective on how things ""went down."" This is more suitable for older children, but don't hesitate to buy it for yourself and wait until they too are pulling it off the shelf!"
5,Amazingly Funny!,"I'm a 12 year-old kid, and I still love this point of view of thestory the three little pigs. I got kind of tired of the old story ofthe three little pigs, but this book is incredible! It's like a whole other story!I don't acctually own the book(unfortunately), but it was read to me at school once. It makes me feel sorry for the wolf, because I always thought that he had no feelings and that he was just a bad and mean wolf.I heard many versions of the three little pigs. The one where the 2 little pigs get eaten and the 3rd stayes alive, the one where all the pigs stay safe in the 3rd pig's house, and many more. But I must say, out of all the versions I have ever read, this one was defenitly my favorite one, and it deserves 5 stars. I greatly recomend it to you. END"
1,Not very good,I get the feeling some of the reviews here are from the author's friends or publisher. This is not a good book. It is gross and unbelievable for children (why did the pig die? falling in a hole does not kill you!). It is immaturely flippant for adults. Forget this book.
4,True story of the three little pigs,"I think that this was a pretty fun and interseting book. It is about the wolf from the three little pigs, and hes telling his side of the story. Overall i think that this is a pretty good book, and is defintly fun to read."
5,Stephen S.,This is a very funny book. Instead of the usual three little pigs story this is told from the wolfs point of view and as you can guess makes the wolf the good guy. For example the wolf says the reason he blew the house down was because he sneezed. He also says that the three little pigs were very rude. So in finally I would say this is a book worth reading because it's so different from what wealways heard growing up.
5,The True Story of the Three Little pigs,"The book, The True Story of the Little Pigs is about how the wolf gets to tell his side of the story. In this classic and old story it is twisted into a laugh out loud book that is very entertaining to all ages."
5,The True Story Of The Three Little Pigs,"I am writing a review on 'The True Story Of The Three Little Pigs'.There are a lot of stories called 'The Three Little Pigs and The Big Bad Wolf' but this is the true story.I like this story because it is very funny.I like the part when the wolf sneezes because he has a cold.Then the pig's house falls because it is made of staw.The pig is just laying there,so the wolf eats it.Then he says;Think of it as a hamburger just laying there.That is funny."
4,Not for little kids,This is interesting spin on the traditional story of the three little pigs. It is told from the perspective of the big bad wolf. I read this to my 2 1/2 year old and I doubt I will be reading it to him again until he's a little older. This book is geared more for older kids and adults. I found some of the concepts hard for small children to understand; comparing eating a little pig to us eating a cheeseburger. Most of the illustrations are very cute but some of them are a little abstract. This is very entertaining for the appropriate age group.
5,Two sides to every story,The students in my third grade class love this story. They were very interested in finding out what the wolf's side of the story was! It is a funny way to look at the same event from two different points of view. I introduced this book as part of a newspaper mini-lesson. We talked about always finding out both sides of the stoy they are working on. My students now take this lesson to heart as they write their own newspaper articles.
4,It's a great book for people who have alot of exuses to say.,"It all started with a cold and a cup of sugar. My favourite characters of this book were all the pigs. I liked them because they were all pretty dumb except the last pig which was mean. The third pig looked very rich. I thought he might have owned five million sacks of sugar. Sometimes the stories we hear are not always true. There is always another side to each and everyone's story. This time the wolf gets to share his with you. Did the wolf ever get the cup of sugar after all? If he didn't, then you can give it to him."
5,Great Read,"I read this book in grammar school n' just absolutely loved it! It's funny n' witty. So I bought it for my young niece to enjoy the same experience I did as a child n' she just loves it too, even if her favorite pic in the book is of the lil' piggies butt in the air! Definitely a great read, and a must buy for any age."
5,uproariously funny,"I was in a children's store looking for a book to buy my godchild, when I stumbled upon this prize. This book was absolutely hilarious. The whole concept that it was not the wolf that should be blamed, but his sneezy, runny cold, that is absolutely priceless. I am sure my godchild and her mother who will read the story to her will enjoy equally. This book should adorn the shelves of every family with small children."
1,I found this objectionable,"I thought this was a cute concept and was looking forward to giving it to my grandchildren. However, I was horrified when the wolf ate the pigs. The book was very funny except for this part so if eating the pigs doesn't bother you I would recommend it. However, I will be returning it."
5,truly a fun book to read,This book is awesome! I bought this for my 5 year old and we both enjoy this classic tale with a twist! It is great for boy or girl and has beautiful pictures. The story line is captivating and is a frequent read in our home.
4,The True Story of the Three Little Pigs,The True Story of the Three Little Pigs is a fun childs book. It is has its own personal twist and a story u never read anything like. The story of this book is very funny.While you are reading this book you can imagine it going on through your head.The illustrations of this book are also really creative.I give this book a two thumbs up.
5,The TRUE sory of the 3 little pigs,"I loved this book! This book allowed the wolf to finally explain himself with what happened with the 3 little pigs. The wolf was not trying to eat the pigs all he wanted to do was get an ingredient for his granny's cake. There is a story about the three little pigs already, but in that books it is bias and I think it makes the wolf look bad, when he really isn't. It taught children that the wolf should not always be blamed for the things that happen with animals smaller than he. I think if children read this that they will learn to hear both sides of a problem, and not just assume which is right, and which is wrong."
5,The truth speaks for itself!,"It may have been written as a children's book, but I'm surethat people of any age will enjoy it. There's nothing likefinding out the other side of the story and having a goodlaugh when you see how silly the misconceptions we haveof the wolf are! It is definately one to keep on the shelvesfor a lifetime of laughs. :"
5,An excellent book for children of all ages to enjoy,"Jon Scieszka's ""biography"" of Al wolf's tru tale of a sneeze and a cup of sugar is an exciting and funny book. Al Wolf tells his tale as a simple misunderstanding and a Wolf that ate 2 pigs because he didn't want to waste any food. This new twist of the original story creates a new story for young kids to enjoy. Al Wolf makes the kids believe that the pigs are evil and that Al shouldn't be considered big and bad because his diet consists of cute fury animals. An excellent picture book for kids to see how the wolf is illustrated as a proper man, and the pigs illustrated as slobs. A must-buy book for all children."
5,I thought this book is a very useful tool.,"I am a graduate student studying elementary education. I used this book to do a project on point of view of different characters in the same storyline. I first read the story ""The Three Little Pigs,"" and then I read ""The True Story of The 3 Little Pigs!"" It is a perfect way for students to see two sides of the same story."
5,purchase,i only read this book once and found it to be a very cute story. the price was good and the shipping was quick thank you very much
2,Customer,The book wasn't in good shape and I really was dissatisfied with what they had sent me nevertheless I kept the book.
1,THE TRUE STORY OF AN EXCHANGE GONE BAD!,I bought this book for my daughter. It took almost a full month to arrive. I found that to be excessive since I paid alot for shipping and handling. When it finally came we sat down to read it. Much to our surprise there was writing all over inside of it. This left me having to answer the question of why I bought some other little girls book. If I had known it was this damaged I would have not purchased it. I feel the description was very in accurate.
2,Frustrating and Disappointing,"Couldn't wait to get these, but my daughter and I were very disappointed with them.They're dusty and don't have enough variety.Who wants to see camel hair, dog hair, cat hair, sheep hair, mouse hair, etc., if there's no real distinction between them?Also the insect slides consisted of bugs that weren't flattened properly, so what you get to see is a lump that's supposed to be an ant, another lump that's a fruitfly, and so on.How hard is it to lay the ant flat on the slide? If it's hard for Learning Resources, they shouldn't be in the business of making slides.I feel completely ripped off, and I feel bad that my kid doesn't get to enjoy what could've been an awesome educational experience."
4,Review for Prepared Slides,"Great for instructional purposes, a good variety of objects, well-mounted, but the slides are quite dusty. Each specimen looks like it's floating in outer space, surrounded by a field of stars. They were probably created in an environment with poor air quality."
2,Not really for a microscope,"If you are looking for prepared slides to view under moderate magnification with a microscope, these slides are not for you. They are made by scotch-taping large specimens onto a glass slide. Since they are not thin enough to transmit light, they are more suitable for a dissecting microscope with top illumination. The Konus brand is much better quality."
3,You get what you pay for,"48 specimens for less than $[...] bucks. That's less than 50 cents a specimen. I wasn't expecting a lot for my money and I didn't get a lot either. There's a reason why these slides are in the ""toy"" section. They're good enough, for the price, but certain not high quality. The better your microscope (both top and bottom illumination is really necessary for the insect specimens), the better your experience."
4,Arrived promptly and the child was satisfied,"I ordered this for a seven-year old boy who already owns a toy microscope and wants more slides ""so that he can be a better scientist."" He seemed entirely satisfied.I am hesitant to review in detail because I haven't viewed the slides personally.I don't believe that the quality of his microscope is very good (was purchased by someone else for less than $20) so it speaks well to the slides if he is able to use them at all!The slides arrived promptly in the busy holiday season. They were clearly marked and organized, and after a long evening of searching seemed like a very good choice."
5,sliced thin,Very nice. Samples are sliced thin so you get a great illumination on them. Daughter 9 loves looking at them.
4,discovery,It displays an interresting diversity of specimens. Kids loved it. Four per slides is a good set up. Helps understanding life.
4,Very good pre-made slides.,"I purchased these slides along with a microsope as a Christmas gift for a 7 year old. Glad that I purchased some pre-made slides. Making her own was a little too difficult. She still loves looking at hair, insects, salt, seeds, etc. but these were a great start on slides that are too difficult for a young child to make."
4,Good slides,These slides are very educational and interesting. My daugther got these slides along with a microscope for Christmas and has had a very good time looking at all the different slides.
3,Is o.k. for beginner,"Is a good slice, but just for beginners, as soon you have you micro you will be start experimenting with another thing, so you will uses a short time. Maybe is a better idea buy a book for learn to prepare your own slice.This is just my opinion"
3,interesting slides,"great for use with the Learning Resources Microscope, until you can make your own slides."
5,So much fun they don't know it's educational,This is a higher quality than expected. My 7 year old operated it with ease and excitement.
3,Faulty description of prepared slides,"This description says there are 48 prepared slides, but there are only 24.Not good! And not up to your standards."
1,Too warped to focus well.,"Go with ""bigger kid"" prepared slides. You have to be there to help the little littles with the scope, anyway."
5,The best monitor! Love it!,"We decided on a video monitor for our second child. We put it in our first child's room while I was still pregnant with #2 just to try it out. We fell in love with how we were able to see everything so clearly! It allowed us to see when he fell asleep and woke up without disturbing him. We had to get the second camera so we could see both boys at the same time. There are two channels, so it's easy to flip back and forth. We've never had interference, even when they sleep in the same room. I would recommend this camera to anyone!!!"
1,Not good 2nd camera,"We bought this a second camera for the handheld monitor + camera. It initially worked but for some reason after a couple of days there was no video, only audio, from this source. No amount of configuring with the two cameras would make this unit work. The company, Healthcheck, gave us grief to no end about returning/exchanging. Not until we gave them a bad review on Amazon.com did they relent. You shouldn't have to go through so much fighting to force customer service!"
4,Works good,"We've had this product for about 5 years and it's currently on it's 3rd kid. The battery is no longer any good, and the LCD is starting to fade, but 5 years is a great lifespan for a product like this and I think we've gotten our moneys worth. It's saved us countless trips up and down the stairs to check on coos, or bumps in the night."
5,MUST HAVE,This is a must have for parents. It is so nice to see your child sleep without going into their room and waking them up. I can't live without it. So when I found out I was pregnant again when my son was only 7 months old I needed to have another video monitor. Don't go out and buy a whole new unit just buy this camera. I have the one pointed at the toddler and one at the baby. It is great. Just switch from one channel to the other to see the boys. I have heard that it doesn't work well if you have a lot of other baby monitors around yours. I don't have any kids next door to us so it works great. MUST HAVE!!
5,A Great First Encyclopedia,"I bought this encyclopedia for my first grader and rising kindergartner. The scope of topics is very wide while the entries range from short to more extensive for what the publishers label ""Special Features"". This is a list of 37 ""important topics"" ranging from the continent of Africa and Art to Dinosaurs, Earth and the two World Wars. The illustrations are excellent and the use of bold type in the entries alerts you to separate entries for those words. I find this an outstanding jumping off point for my children to peruse and answer their questions or lead them to deeper questions. Most attractive to me in my comparison to other encyclopedias was the more tasteful and less explicit treatment of the Reproduction entry. We're not ready for that much information."
2,"Flashes of brilliance, BUT...","I tried to like this album. Really I did. Some of the songs were memorable, even showing flashes of brilliance at times (""This is Who You Are"", ""Mephistopheles' Return""). What ruined it for me were the cringe-worthy moments, which unfortunately abounded on this disc."
3,melodramatic,"This sounds like a high school glee club version of GREASE. Melodramatic, with Mephistopheles in the Travolta role and Beethoven in the Olivia Newton John role. Hyperbolic and tries too hard."
2,not what I expected,"I have some of this music, really liked but this is not the one. It was okay nothing I would tell others to buy.Mary Lynn"
5,A Last Illusion!!!,"I'm not going to analyze this CD from each and every aspect. The song A Last Illusion is worth the price alone! Yes, it's that good! I'm a hugh Savatage/TSO fan, and I have to say, A Last Illusion is one of the best songs either band has done! I listen to all kinds of Prog/Power Metal, and in my opinion Rhapsody has nothing on the Trans-Siberian Orchestra! Actually, TSO's music sounds more real and less overdone. Do yourself a favor and buy this disc if you like symphonic metal! Madness Reigns!!!"
5,Beethoven's Last Night,"If you like TSO, you will like this older non-Christmas music. I bought this cd because we were going to their spring concert & wanted to be familar with the songs. I ended up falling in love with the songs and still listen to it all the time. All their music have a story line, so read the booklet that comes with the cd. I would also advised getting NightCastle their newest cd."
5,TSO comes out of the X-mas closet.,First thing I have to do is give kudos to the TSO engineers for great mixing and effects. This CD is full of musical fades and reverbs throughout the album. Good Job. Next I have to go ahead and say that the musical content on this album is better than the engineering. The rendition of Bethoven on this album is outstanding and the searing guitar work is brilliant. Open your mind a little bit. This is a great concept album and has much potential for comercial sales. Especially due to the fact that it is not a Christmas album. There are many artists that are doing the same thing. Don't mistake musical genius for a lack of talent.
3,"sorry, Aire Effe :)","Aire Effé from Alton, Illinois, and anyone else who's never heard bach or beethoven on guitar before, it's been done for so long,starting in the early 1980's by guys like Yngwie Malmsteen, Paul Gilbert, and many others. even though you've never heard it, it's been done MANY times, and i must say by WAY better guitar players :) no that this guy isn't good, but he's nowhere near as technical as any of the neoclassical guys. here's a list of the good guys if anyone is interested.... Yngwie Malmsteen, Jason Becker, Paul Gilbert, George Bellas, Vinnie Moore, Tony Macalpine, and Chris Impellitteri. There's plenty others, but these guys are the most classical-derivitive. if you liked the guitar playing on this album, check out anythign from these guys, it'll blow you away!"
5,Beethoven`s STILL ALIVE !,"Its taken awhile for this CD to grow on me but now it has I am ready to write a short review on it. The vocals are great, the music is fantastic ,ultimatly this CD gave me the feeling that Beethoven is secretly still alive and had something to do with it, as its so haunting and emotional. Paul O`niell your a credit to music and your fans.GET THIS CD give it 5 plays to sink in, and enjoy!"
4,Entertaining,I have listened to the CD several times over the last week. I am a Big fan of Beethoven. This CD is very entertaining and I can envision this CD becoming a very good play. The mixture of Classical and electric music is quite intriging. It's Beethoven with Malmsteen playing with him. The story in the CD is Excellent.
3,Overall: Pretty Good,"Music: Excellent Singing: Mediocre Storyline: HorribleWorth the purchase, but an instrumental version would be better. The characters who do Beethoven and Theresa are good. Mephistopheles is overly enthusiastic.The storyline puts the music to shame. It's like A Christmas Carol gone horribly wrong. I would recommend this title if you like the classical/rock blend. The orchestra with guitars and drums make for a very unique sound. However, if you want a good story or good singing, I would recommend Andrew Lloyd Webber's Whistle Down the Wind."
5,Exceptional!,"Truely an excellent album, this rock opera explores a great but suffering composer's reflection on the value of his life's work, on passion and despair, altruism or self interest, honesty and deceit, love and loss. Be sure to read the lyrics and storyline contained in the case insert. Somewhat in the style of the classics Christmas Carol and Its a Beautiful Life, the protagonist has the opportunity to reflect on how his life affects others, and how things might have been different - while haunted and helped by spirits. Distinctly Trans-Siberian Orchestra, sometimes rough and jarring, sometimes sweetly melodic. I'd love to see this album performed as a stage play or film musical."
5,Exceptional,"I recently saw TSO in concern in Rochester NY near Christmas and was floored with the production. I had seen the lit-up house to their Wizards in Winter song on the ""Last Christmas Eve"" album. So I was only to happy to explore more. I bought that album right away and played it constantly. Loved it.Not having the fill of their music, and thinking it was time to move on from a Christmas theme (It was February)I ventured into this album and fell in love with this one as well.If you like theatrical type music the like of Meatloaf, but with more musical oomph, you will love their stuff. There is a story and magnificent voices. The voice of ""Beethoven"" on this album is fantastic. Wow.Songs 6, 12 and 15 rank as my favorites.I hope to buy more of their stuff.The creator of TSO, I understand was the creator of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" of 70s fame, an album I was addicted to (and I am not religious at all). No wonder it is so great."
4,You like Meat Loaf?,"If you like Meat Loaf, you will really like this album as well. In fact Patti Russo who joined Meat on his Bat 2 tour and sang on his ""Welcome To The Neighborhood"" album sings her heart out on this disc. The sound is what you get if you take a little Andrew Lloyd Webber (""Evita"", ""Cats"", ""Jesus Christ Superstar""), Jim Steinman (Meat Loaf, Bonnie Tyler, Celine Dion etc) and just a dash on mid 70's Alice Cooper and you have Trans-Siberian Orchestra. In fact, the album does sound very much like the Webber/Steinman written ""Whistle Down The Wind"". The plot of ""Beethoven's Last Night"" is a bit strained, but the music is fantastic. Standout tracks include ""The Moment"", ""Vienna"", ""Requiem (The Fifth)"", ""After The Fall"", ""Mephistopheles' Return"" and ""Misery"". A pretty cool album for the adventurous mind."
3,"Not as good, but OK","In short, this is a good CD, but the material doesn't measure up to the level of the Christmas CDs. There are some memorable songs, but a lot of throw aways as well..."
2,did not like it,i bought two of there cds a the same time. since i like the one song wizards in winter on cd lost xmas. so i bought this one at the same time. will never do that again just thought the songs would be like the wizards in winter cd lost xmas.did not like this cd either only a few songs where any good unless you are a trans-siberian orchestra person you may not like this cd.
2,Not up to par,"While I recognized that the Christmas offerings from TSO were a bit contrived, they were full of extremely interesting music. This CD is loud and often strident. It has its moments, but not enough to excape being a disappointment."
2,Savatage Fan Disappointed,"This sounds like a Meat Loaf and Jim Steinman Bat Out Of Hell cover band. But not as good. Coming from a die hard Savatage fan, saying that Meatloaf made a better album than Paul O'Neil is disappointing but true."
1,Don't waste your time or money,Largely vocal and not too good at that. I was hoping for more instramental and was hugely disappointed. Guess I should have read t he Amazon review first. Love some of their Chrismas music but hate the vocal.
1,I hate opera,"The group fooled me ""Orchestra"" meant music but this group insists on having someone sing on each track. When the guy shuts up the music is quite good but they apparently want to do opera. I was personally hoping for something akin to ""Switched on Bach"" some modern rendition of Beethoven's work. Its probably fine for those that want to listen to someone sing but it was a disappointment."
1,A great CD...,"... for the microwave, or under the short leg of your table, or as a shooting target. Tooth-rottingly sugary, pretentious, overblown, commercialized crap from a half-a$$ed sell-out 80's band."
4,A Rock Opera waiting to happen!,"The Trans-Siberian sound we have come to love in Christmas music comes to pay a visit to Beethoven. From the opening overture to the soft lullabye ending, this disk is a wonder to the ear. I cannot seem to get it out of my player. The majority of the music is original material, but homages to Ludwig are present as well as Mozart's Requiem and Rimsky-Korsakov's Flight of the Bumblebee. While listening to the music and reading the lyric sheet I could not help but picture this album done as a rock opera. I cannot wait to see the tour that will follow this album. The only downside I could possibly see to this particular disk is the over-use of suspended chord changes and the singular use of character voices (we hear a LOT of Jody Ashworth who sings Beethoven's part). All in all, I would gladly recommend this CD to anyone who likes their classical music ""rocked up"". Keep up the good work, T-SO!"
3,Beethoven's Last Night,"Nice Beethoven music, disappointing as it was not the usual Trans-Siberian Orchestra style. I had quick service on this item which was great for Christmas"
1,Lousy CD,This CD left a lot to be desired. One good song on the entire CD. I was expecting a little more from Trans Siberian Orchestra.
5,Incredible,"This CD is magnificant. Not only that it's clever. I would recommend this CD to everyone from a classical lover to a new age music fan to a traditional rock music fan. If you like the creativeness and lush musicality of Meatloaf's works, you will love this Album. It shows great creativity and true artistry to create a work like this. It also takes a lot of guts to create such a story line about someone so famous. The story line is wonderfull, the music is superb! I Hope that this will be produced the same way Tommy was. It's fantastic! Take the advise from the other reviewer's and listen to it all at once. at least for the first time. This CD shows a good deal of thinking and artistry. Trans-Siberian Orchestra and all those associated with Beethoven's last night has a true gift for music, storytelling, and poetry. If I could give this album ten stars I would."
5,Another Day at Work,"Trans Siberian Orchestra is, without question, the most unique performing group today. They defy being labeled, yet transcend all genres of music. Whether you are a classical buff or wont settle for anything less than hard rock, this group turns their stories into pure enjoyment for their listeners. Certainly worth the price, and certainly worth the time to listen and enjoy!"
2,"Not half the CD ""Christmas Eve"" is","If you're planning on buying this because you LOVE the Christmas Eve CD... Don't! You will be sorely disappointed. The original material on this CD is not very good, and there is very little Beethoven music. Without the magic of the Season to lend it beauty and power, this TSO release feels too contrived."
3,It's ok,"This Cd is a little on the different side. If it were just music without the singing, it would have been a little more enjoyable. It's like listening to a rock musical.A bit unusual. Not to my taste. I really enjoyed the Christmas music these guys put out. This CD is not like their Christmas music."
5,TSO ROCKS!,You only need to see Trans-Siberian Orchestra one time in concert to become an all time fan. A must-have CD to add to your TSO collection.
3,not sure ?,"To be honest in this review I Have to say I`m not sure about this? I listen to Beethoven and I like Savatage ,I don`tthink its a bad idea trying to blend old classics and modern semi prog together, but this missesits good thats about it. I would like to say to get itbut i will say if you are a Paul Oneil fan and you liked poets and madmen you will probably like this, but I`m still not sure?"
3,Just not as good as the others,"""Over the top"" is a good description of this CD. I was enthralled with ""Christmas Eve And Other Stories"" and found this one to be a disappointment. Guess I'm just not one who believes that lyrics should be screamed."
3,Disappointing after such a long wait,"I looked forward to this album's release, especially after hearing TSO's treatment of ""Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring,"" on THE CHRISTMAS ATTIC, but I was disappointed by the final product. The instrumentals are still good but there are far too few of them. The choral numbers are identical to those in ATTIC and the soloist voices, except for Patti Russo, sound like good community theatre, at best.The plot, while cute, has little substance and a too-cute plot ""twist"" at the end. The lyrics are simplistic and reminded me of some things written by friends in college, or maybe an improv song on ""Whose Line Is It Anyway?""I had great hopes for this album. It's too bad that TSO got so wrapped up in wanting to be Broadway producers and forgot about making good music. I'll just program my CD player to play the good bits and leave the rest out."
4,Another good TSO album,"TSO always does a great job of mixing different genres of music and this is no exception. Personally, I love songs without vocals much much more than the ones with vocals. I just don't feel their singers are that strong and often sound like they are ""trying"" too hard, but maybe that is just me. Still a good album and I recommend it."
5,Oustanding,"Just perfect for the Prog Rock enthusiast and all-round musician alike. The indentification of ""classical"" music quotes throughout the CD is a delight. An intelligent and creative use of cross genre musical output. I just wish Beethoven and Mozart were around to hear it."
5,Masterpiece,"I have all of TSO's CD's and have seen them a number of times in concert. I consider this CD a masterpiece of music. I can't stop listening to it. When you consider what a wasteland most music is nowadays, this CD is in a class by itself. If you haven't seen TSO in concert yet, I strongly encourage you to do so - their show has to be seen to be believed. I took my reluctant wife and daughters to see them several years ago, and to say that they were blown away is an understatement. Now we all go each year when they tour."
3,Decent,"The concept of the cd was what initially drew me too it. A 'rock opera' centered around Beethovens last night on earth; a scenario that obviously has some merit. However, the plot line (such as it was) was weak and the characters were unremarkable. The story is difficult to follow unless you are listening really closely and have the liner notes in your hand. That being said the musicians obviously put some heart and soul into their work, and it does come across. The music itself is vibrant and interesting in it's concept. I like the versions of Fur Elise and Requiem. Unfortunately, the talent of the musicians aren't able to overcome the flaws in the music themselves. An interesting diversion, especially if you are a fan of the Christmas albums, but if this is going to be your introduction to Trans-Siberian Orchestra I would recommend checking those out first."
2,"Great Musicianship, Missed Opportunity","CD reminds me of some of the Alan Parsons Project efforts. The music is great on this, but I have to say some of the vocals were, for me, unlistenable. Zak Stevens and the girls (including Patti Russo, of Meat Loaf's band) were excellent. But Ashworth? Not his style. Sounds like a credible/good metal singer, but totally unsuited for this. The songs he sings lead on ruined the CD for me."
3,"Good concept, mediocre production.","I greatly enjoyed the first two TSO albums. However, I feel that the inspiration behind this disk was forced and contrived in places. Fans of TSO will most likely enjoy parts of this album, but in places the songs simply become operatic slugfests. Standout tracks include ""The Dreams of Candlelight"", and ""I'll keep Your Secrets"", and the album's finale is very touching. Even though song quality is lacking in places, the production quality of this album is first rate."
2,Performance found lacking,"While the musical compostion of the piece is superb and the instrumentals fall just short of excellent, the vocal performances on the score are sorely lacking in musicality. Most of the the songs seem to fall more in the catagory of speak-singing then actual song, the music of the lyrical parts apparently sacrificed for the sake of clarity of the word and meter. Sadly, it detracts from the piece as the lyrics tend to be rather humdrum. A disappointment, especially for a fan of both Beethoven and classical-rock fusion."
5,TSO - Beethoven's Last Night,"Exceptional music. Awesome composition combining classical and contemporary music. At first lyrics can sound depressing, but as you take the time to listen you can appreciate the multitude of feeling that come through the music and lyrics."
5,No one does it like Anthony Newman.,"First off The Brandenburg Concertos are the greatest thing ever. If you want your mind blown by the ahead of its times sound of Bach at his near mightiest then go Brandenburg. Then, let me say that no one does these concertos better then Anthony Newman. He is awesome! He'll kick anything into overdrive and add his own flavor to it. Which is exactly how it should be done. If there is already a recording of a certain piece then what is the point of recording another just like it. Change it up people. Come on, let's reinvent this stuff, let's be as innovative as the master composers who wrote this stuff would try to be. Do you think if they were in our shoes that they would just be doing the same old recordings over and over. No, they would add originality to it. This here is an original interpretation and I think you should hear it."
3,"Ok golden Earring,not great.","Golden Earring being one of my top 5 bands,I hate to rate this low.Not enough meat here but a couple of nice potatoes,if you get my drift.The songs do not venture in to the flowing uniqueGE territory that I am used to.Loving Cesars drumming I also hate to say, that here it almost sound like he is only using one arm.But hey, I still like to throw this one on every so often ,just for a change."
2,not the best,This is not build like the other toys of the series. Very limited when posing. The accessories are too heavy for the figure and he falls over. Mattel needs to build a better figure. He looks great but slightly small and not manueverable enough.
2,Yikes!!,"This is 1 of those book where you say: is this the same author who wrote so & so books?I can't bellieve this is the guy who wrote The Puppet King & The Last Thane. These characters are as cold & rigid as Icewall itself. The story is flat & lifeless too. I won't be reading the other books in the trilogy. Matter of fact, I didn't make through all of this one."
4,Gadzooks!!,"Dougie really does the job on this one! great plot, well written, lots of action....all the ingredients to a DL Masterpiece! this one is for sure a hall of famer in my book! Great characters, well planned and developed, suspenseful (to an almost annoying point!!) i cant wait to read the next two if they are going to be anything like this one was!! one of my fav's now. Its a good one so dont miss out on it if you are a DL fan!"
4,It was Good,"I liked this novel. I found the setting to be unique, and I liked the character of Kerrick the exiled elf. While I found the story better when reading the entire trilogy, I did not find the characters lifeless as others have mentioned. This is not the very best of Niles, but I found it to be a good story to breeze through."
4,A bit of a slow start to a great trilogy,"This book definitely gets off to a slow start, but it picks up at the end. And when taken as a part of the Icewall trilogy, it rates a bit higher than it would as a stand-alone novel. It is set in the Dragonlance world, but a reader would not need prior knowledge of DL history to enjoy this. Fans of Dragonlance and fantasy in general should enjoy this- Niles is a talented author."
3,Where are the editors?,"I can't believe they still write books these days with this little editing. I would have given this book four stars out of five but the obvious spelling and grammatical errors just grate on my nerves after a while. As to the book, it starts out very slow, picking up steam until the end. By the end I would say it was a very good book. Hey Mr. Niles, if you ever read this review and need a better editor, I would be more than happy to look over your books a final time before they are released for the small fee of $10 (or if you just want to buy me a beer thats good too) Let me know!"
2,Niles at his blandest,"Perhaps it was his attempt to capture the mentality of the barbarians and ogres featured in this book that lead Douglas Niles to such a blockish storyline and such unconvincing characters. Douglas Niles brought me to the world of fantasy with his Moonshae Trilogy and kept me reading with Druidhome, Maztica, Kinslayer, and Kagonesti. He is one of my favorite writers in the genre. I'm not sure how this trilogy bodes for his fans."
1,Review this book before purchasing,"I purchased this book sight unseen based on the author's description. Once I received it, I was disappointed in the lack of new information or insights. Most of what is provided in this book is more thoroughly presented in other machine quilting books. The only ""new"" technique presented is a description on how Caryl Fallert creates her machine quilted feathers. I also found the exercises and sample quilts uninspiring. I would heartily recommend Guide to Machine Quilting by Diane Gaudynski and Infinite Feathers by Anita Shackleford instead. At a minimum, view the book in person so you can decide whether its worth spending your money on."
2,"Topic is interesting, but style is lacking","Gil Bogen's book on Johnny Kling is informative- but rather poorly written. He uses language in describing the early twentieth century games that is clearly derived from the ""purple prose"" of the times, but it comes across as awkward and stilted. It would be one thing if he simply quoted such language- but his version of it is forced. In addition, there is much ""blow by blow"" description of games, which gets boring very quickly. Finally, he persists in calling Johnny Kling a ""premier catcher"" in seasons where he caught 100 games. This is an arbitrary categorization- it is true that there has been discussion over the years of catchers who caught 100 or more games the most seasons ( sometimes the most consecutive seasons), but I am not aware of any place where calling such catchers premier is established.The most interesting part of the book is the research on his Jewish heritage. Otherwise, I would not recommend it."
5,toilet chemical,"The chemical works well in our tank, easy to install and worked on the first flush. We recommend this product to everyone."
3,Bought to use as KaBoom Scrub Free cleaner replacements.,Three fits holder perfectly and work just as well as KaBoom. Smell is much less than Chlorine tablets. Life seems about the same. Price is pennies to dollars over KaBoom.
2,Not really 10.5 inches...,"This pan is useable. My biggest complaint is that the cooking surface is not 10.5 inches, the top rim is. The cooking area is only about nine, which makes a huge difference. It isn't really even big enough to cook bacon, which is why I wanted a square pan. I use it for eggs and cornbread, but I think my cornbread tastes better in a round cake pan. I like the way it looks. I am not sure how well it was pre-seasoned."
5,Perfect for my steak!,"I love using this cast iron to cook my steak indoors. It has even heat distribution and sears the meat to perfection. Two medium sized steaks could fit side by side and it would cook the steaks to a good medium rare at medium to high heat for 5 minutes each side. Cast irons are the best cooking tools, they can outlive you and they even get better with long use. They make a good heirloom too... just imagine passing them down from one generation to another."
2,"Good, but...","I am a big fan of cast iron, but the shape of this pan is not conducive to cooking over a burner. By nature of its shape, you tend to get a hot spot in the middle, and cool areas in the corners. (This is because the flame is round). You would be better off getting a round skillet instead."
4,"Great Pan, Terrible Coating","The ""seasoned"" coating on this product is horrible. The factory coating must have wax or something and to rid the pan of it I followed the instructions to add additional seasoning to the pan. The result was a sticky mess. I decided to stick the pan in the oven using the cleaning cycle, a method I use to clean my commercial grade half sheet pans and it ridded the pan of the sticky problem. I then used a vegatable oil and seasoned the pan using a process similar to the product instructions and all is good. Great pan, terrible coating!"
3,Not my favorite,"Hmmm... only a few cuts on this CD that really speak to me - otherwise, felt like lots of filler material."
5,Aslan's Crazy World,"Aslans crazy world is well.... Brilliant!, An Irish Top 10 twice ! its timeless classic rock music from the hearts of the musicians who wrote and perform it. When you buy this your are only getting a glimpse of their brilliance, you will have to buy the album, then surely travel the world to see them live."
3,"Brilliant Art, Great Concept, Muddled Characters","Templesmith is a master artist and conceptualist, but Singularity 7 shows that he still needs some work on storytelling and characterization. Some of the characters are hard to tell apart, and no character ever comes out as a lead. I have no problem with emsemble pieces, but there were characters that seemed like they were only in the story to serve as a lead, then never got to be one. The boy with the dragon tattoo on his face, for example (those who've read this will understand).Negatives aside, Templesmith's art has always been exceptional, and he does not break from that here. Plus, the concept of the story is extremely engaging, even when the characters are not. It's too bad that this is a self-contained story, because the story could have gone on as a series for quite some time. I have high hopes for his current series, Shadowplay, and hope to see that published as a collection soon."
4,Ben Templesmith... extraordinary!,"I will be simple... Great story (it is Templesmith debut as a storyteller), the art is his own kind, very special, I love all the details of his art and this terror scy-fi graphic novel. I rate this book with four stars (instead five) because the quality of the binding is disgusting..."
2,For Readers looking for the strange,"Then this is for you. It's an interesting story about a post apocalyptic world, but the art just threw me off. It was chaotic and a bit jarring. The story was decent, with flat characters and some gore.Wouldn't recommend unless you like strange graphic novels"
3,Singularity 7,"Product came with very heavy / prominent creases and one small tear in a page. However, that still made it no less enjoyable as a story - which is unbelievably fantastic i might add - a testament to Mr. Templesmith's ingenuity and to his mastery of freshly crafted ideas. I actually can't remember where the tear was - very small and i fixed with some tape. This sort of thing would usually bug someone as finicky as me but the art/ story really makes up for that. I would really recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Mr. Templesmith or of works of the post - apocalyptic genre."
2,Muddled and Mediocre,"If you want an idea of Singularity 7, think of the liner artwork from a third-tier industrial band combined with the writing of an angsty teenage aspiring novelist, and you'd be in the right ballpark. This is not to say that Templesmith's art is without some technical ability; it's more to say that it's painfully unoriginal, and the melty surrealist style serves to neuter what little action is available in the book, leaving mounds of mushy exposition to carry the plot.A much better version of a very similar basic story can be found in Snikt, the post-apocalyptic Wolverine story by Tsutomu Nihei, for those in desperate need of a moody, nanotech apocalypse story in graphic novel form."
1,eye-opener of perverted criminal justice,"The book persuaded me to abandon all arguments why the death penalty for murder is a good and effective idea. The celebrated case was not based on racial profiling but on status profiling. So a drifter (no fixed employment or residence) caught up in a criminal case is deemed ""guilty until you prove otherwise"". The book is not even about prejudice or narrow local interests it's about piss-poor police forensic investigation and a perverted one-eyed view by the DA to convict and punish before the trial begins."
4,Cedric Bebnow,"The is a very well written and easy to read book. However Mr. Morrow does not insult his readers by being to elementery. The logic in the book goes beyond making the message clear. As you read you will begin to see what part you play in the ""killing"". This is the best non-fiction books I have read in four years..."
2,Disappointed,I ordered this book because I had a copy of the 365 day meditation book and this one was a 52 week book...Not nearly the same effect. Disappointed. Will continue to look for the 365 day version.
1,dumbed down,The author (i.a.) has written better books.Here he takes the low road in a production thatmost math aficionados regard as a forgettable andmisguided venture.
4,NICE SET...NO COLOR GUIDE?,"I can see why some Folks don't like the Fox Run Flower and Butterfly 11 Piece Cookie Cutter Set, They are very small, Not for Cookies and I knew all of this, after reading your Reviews. I've got many Cookie Cutters: Tear Drops Butterflies Circles Animals Maple Leafs all kinds of Flowers...etc, however, this is Exactly what I was looking for, something small to give that special touch to Pies and CakesThey are well made Not Flimsy at all, I was very surprised, the only problem is the Set doesn't come with a Color Guide like in the Picture of the Item, without one is hard to put the Pieces back in the Tin...so what I did is very simple, I took a down shot Picture of the open Set, Print it half size, cut and insert it inside the Tin, now you have a Guide to put the Pieces back together! ... Because of the missing Color Guide it only gets four stars. Check my Pictures Posted, Thank You"
4,Very small yet quite nice,Ideal for small applications. In general I wish they were larger for making cookies as I would likely get more use out of them that way.
2,"Cute, but they rust easily.","I bought them last year for under 7 dollars. As cookie cutters, these shapes are really small. I use them to shape cheese and fruits instead. They are cute, but they are easy to rust, so I have had to trash several of them. They are really NOT WORTH your money."
3,Tiny,"Cute cutters, but not for cookies. I'm keeping them to use in decorating, but there is no way you could use these to cut cookies."
5,Cookie Cutters for Fondant,I used these cutters recently to make fondant butterflies for a cake. They are the perfect size to go with fondant flowers. Their sharp edges made the cutting easy. Just be careful to remember where each one was in the tin or you won't be able to get them all back in easily.
4,i like it but...,"The cutters are very cute & I have already used them to make tiny peanut butter sandwiches for my daughter. Cleanup would be difficult if I didn't still have bottle brushes with the nipple cleaner brush attached, but that works well on the nooks & crannies. The problem is getting all of the cutters back in the tin! There aren't pictures of each in the bottom as is common with other tins of this type so trying to work the puzzle to get them back in is frustrating. Other than that, I love them! Now that they are back in place, I plan to trace around them with a pen so I will know how to get them back in the case."
5,Good quality japanese 80's metal,"When it comes to Loudness'american released english language albums,this one is the best.This is the first Loudness album that incorporated some slight elements of pop but it was just right and would give way to an even poppier sounding next album, Hurricane Eyes although that album was a disappointment because they took that pop sound way too far.This album,Lightning Strikes has great songs and it is a must have for fans of 80's metal.The guitar work of Akira Takasaki is great and is on par with people like Eddie Van Halen.The vocals are great too.Faster paced songs like""Face to Face"" and""Black Star Oblivion"" sound like speed metal.This band shows that they are versatile as well as being extremely talented.Every 80's metal collection should have Loudness in it."
5,Neil Connelly finds a way to rock the reader!,"Buddy Cooper Finds a Way is an inventive, completely original novel that does not invite comparisons to anything that's being written today. In it, Connelly creates a world in which the hoopla of professional wrestling blends seemlessly with the insanity of daily life. It's a world that the reader can easily buy into, thanks to Connelly's tight, no-nonsense prose, his sharp eye for detail, and the wrestling lore that he expertly weaves throughout the narrative. The material is often hilarious, yet darker, more serious issues also permeate this many-layered work. Buddy is a fully-realized character; his situation is dire, his fate uncertain. Connelly has crafted a thoughtful, compelling, page-turner of a novel that will resonate on many levels. A must-read!"
3,The Best of Musikladen: Al Stewart,"I was dissappointed at the length of the video. Quality was good, but too short"
4,Great vintage Al Stewart,This video is Al Stewart live on a German TV show in 1979 playing about seven of his best songs from the 1975-1979 period. The picture quality is pretty good and the sound is clear but a little muddy in places--remember this was a TV broadcast. The band is great and the performances sound amazingly close to the studio recordings but with more intensity.
5,45 Minutes Is Not Enough - I Want More!,"There are very few performances of Al Stewart inmortalized on DVD or video.The video and audio quality is good for a concert taken place over 25 years ago. But, most important, is the performance of the artist, and Al Stewart has a way of elevating the audience to a much higher level, and that's what I percieved while watching such great concert.Great songs, great performance. Don't miss this opportunity to adquire a rare gem. Once you see it, and enjoy the songs, you will want more of Al."
4,good dvd to relax to,Al is overlooked in the music biz he has a great sound not all the showoff stuff that is on a lot of music just great music
1,knockoff,"I am Michael Sporn, the director of THE RED SHOES starring Ossie Davis. This DVD is not my film; this is a knock off produced by Goodtimes and features my name on its packaging, though I had nothing to do with this poor product. I urge you not to buy this version of the film and complain to Amazon about the mislabelling of this DVD."
1,Unable to view the film,"When I received the DVD and tried to play it on my American DVD player, I found that it is formatted to be played only on DVD's that are sold in Europe. I emailed the seller that I couldn't use the DVD and he told me if the DVD was opened he couldn't take it back. I looked at the description of the DVD again and found nothing to inidicate this required a special DVD player to view the film. So I learned a valuable lesson. DO NOT BUY from EBAY sellers unless you know exactly what you are getting."
4,Good Shoe,"Good Shoe. It was kinda tight when I first got then, but I am breaking them in now. They are cute for being a non-slip shoe, and the price was great too! I am happy with my choice :)UPDATED 10 months later- Very Pleased with these purchase. Would order again. They are comfortable to stand in all day long. They haven't worn down at all, even with 40+ week running around at work. Worth every penny!"
3,not for wide feet,"If you have a perfect foot, with a nice arch, I could see ordering this shoe. Otherwise, it's a case by case basis. I ordered these shoes and they are not what I was hoping for and I will be returning them. The opening to get your foot in is very tight. I have a wide foot, but I usually wear medium width shoes. I can get my foot in, but it is very apparent that the inside of my foot ""hangs"" over where the shoe is meant to keep the foot in place. The fit as far as sizing length was on target, I wear a 9 and ordered a 9. But, I could see that after some time wearing the shoe, it would begin to wear on my foot. I could stand to go up a half size in this shoe since I will be running around a restaurant all day in them, they shouldn't fit so snugly to my foot. I was going to order a wide in this shoe, but I read a review that the wide isn't that much different from the medium width."
5,zapatos mujer,zapatos confortables y durables mi madre esta muy contenta con este articulo y recomienda a los compradores a que compren este articulo
1,not comfortable,These shoes hurt my feet. Would send back if I could. I wouldn't waste my money. They made my feet sore.
2,maybe for young feet,"these are cute , and comfy at first, but with heel spurs they just dont have enough cushion and support. plus, they are so low to the ground I had to roll up all my pants. going back to a sneaker style ."
2,Not content w/ the size,"The shoes were in excellent condition although the size run a little small and it's really tight.So if ur thinking of buying it remwmberto buy it in a bigger size, at least one size bigger.for example if your size 7 choose a size 8"
2,Not too good...,"I think that this volume has lost focus. The monsters seem completely uninspired (come on - a brain in a jar! ) and most hark from other, better sources. The black-and-white art seems to be low-grade and threatens to rub off on contact (on further examination the suspicion proved true). The saddest part is that all creatures are accompanied with background stories a la Rogues Gallery, but infinitely poorer, barely even scraping the surface of Ravenloft's nature. It really hurts to see this sort of thing from TSR."
1,Quirky says it -,"I was looking for a female version of moon river, and bought this based on other reviews. Victoria's voice is very odd - sort of like Cyndy Lauper singing in a baby voice. Definitely an acquired taste - I'm curious to hear her other cds, but I don't think I need another in my collection."
3,"Are you the ""good for now"" girl?","This book is good for one chapter alone! Are you the ""good for now"" girl or do you have ""wife-potential""? Three regular guys answer questions you've always wanted to know. How to measure the quality of a man's attention? How soon is too soon for sex? This book even goes into the ""Ugly Truth"" - basically, things men would never tell you outright. Sounds like the perfect book - well, almost. It doesn't touch on the foundation of these thoughts or experiences. The authors are pretty vaque about their experiences in certain situations and there's a lot of repeated information. This book is very helpful in the beginning stages of relationships. It helps you determine where you stand. This book doesn't delve very far into intimacy or steps toward engagement."
1,Don't waste your time.,"Besides not wasting your money on this book, don't waste your time. It seems to have been written by three men who have formed their own post-collegiate fraternity, complete with sticky floor and women of little or no self-esteem. I'm aware of many of the differences in outlook between men and women, but even with those in mind, I'll wait to find a man who has matured more than these three have.In addition, the language, sentence structure, and content structure of the book are written at a very low reading level. Are the authors not able to write at a higher level, or do they assume that women won't be able to understand a more sophisticated read?This book made me alternately laugh and cringe. Good for a raunchy comedy, but not so good for a purported self-help book."
2,What the Three Yuppie Stooges Want,"These three guys from My Town (maybe I should leave) with their all too recently acquired ""professional"" credentials (Congratulations, graduate!) presume to tell the ladies how best to go about pleasuring them, and at the end give away these ""ugly truths:"" Looks are almost everything to a guy, and men cheat on women they love. If you are good-looking enough will they not cheat on you? No, because they want ""sexual variety."" So, if you are a ""10"" and don't mind your man having ""sexual variety,"" then all you have to do is properly perform oral sex on them and be ""nice"" (not brilliant or interesting -- a no-no!) and God willing, you should be able to get yourself a yuppie who cheats on you. Happy hunting."
2,These three jerks are laughing all the way to the bank,"...and so are other self-help authors, publishing companies and relationship shrinks, as women get more and more confused about how to deal with men.This book is full of contadictions, like ""professional men don't have time for games and won't stand for them"", while the rest of the book makes excuses for their own game-playing. But we're supposed to applaud them for their ""honesty""No wonder ""The Rules"", in all its absurdity, still managed to sell millions of copies"
1,Garbage,"This book was given to me as a gift and I read most of it. It isn't funny and I don't need these guys to tell me what THEY want. I don't want a man like them, anyway. There are many other books that are far better if you want real advice."
2,"A lawyer, a doctor and an accountant walk into a bar...","If this sounds like a joke, it is. This book is a laugh-out-loud tour into the minds of three very self absorbed individuals. I kept calling my friends to read sections out loud. Beach reading, definetely.Is it helpful? Not really. Ultimately, the surprising thing is not that ""professional men"" don't think like women, as the authors seem to think. The real ""ugly truth"" is that the come across as so...unmanly. Kind of sad and wimpy in a selfish way. So go ahead, give your phone number to that hot construction worker that harasses you every day on your way to work. Since one of the authors' theses is that a man is either attracted to you when he meets you or he will never be, at least you know where you stand with this one."
1,Waste of Money,The advice in this book alternates between painfully obvious and painfully juvenile.Hopefully these authors will stay single for a long time.
2,Depends....,"If you are interested in having a passionate, fun, sexual, ""relationship"" with a man that you don't really care to hang on to in the long run, this book gives great advice on how to keep him hooked until you are bored with him. That will not take too long, I suspect, if he has very much in common with any of the three authors. However, if you are interested in a long-term relationship with a man based on love and respect, you will discover what he wants better than any book can covey. Here's a crazy thought....find out for free what your man wants..ask HIM! And listen without criticizing or becoming defensive. If you can't deal with what he really wants, walk away. One more thing, yes, some men do cheat on women they love....and many of those men are left by their wives/girlfriends who no longer love or trust them. If a man loves a woman enough to commit to her, he should be able to muster the restraint it takes to prevent the destruction of trust in the relationship."
1,Wimpy yuppies..,"I totally agree with the revewer who said that the book is about what spoiled, fed on baby-formula yuppies want (and what they never get). My advice for everybody is to forget this book and look for a real man, a man with a heart. How to find him: don't pretent that you are overly OK and ready to always please him and all these sleazeballs will fall off you by themselves. Unfortunately, there is an element of the sad truth in this book: some high-income men do tend to be self-centered, heartless, stiff, emotionally blind robots; you need to learn to open your eyes and avoid these men. Forget their money and costumes! The book had helped me to do exactly that. A woman is worth for what she is, and stifling yourself up to somebody's boring and empty life will not do any good; those men who still don't get it in their 30s will have to live alone or learn it. The book reminded me of the famous Ted Bundy's quote: ""I am the most coldhearted son of a witch you can ever meet""."
2,If you want the typical preppy man's view,"Some advice was relevant, but it would be easier and cheaper to browse sections that appeal to you at the bookstore. There are other books out there that give a better overall view of the process of dating and relationships (e.g., Gray and Hendricks) also from a male viewpoint (and with Ph.D.'s and more relationship experience)."
1,No wonder these guys are single.,"I wonder if this book should have been entitled ""Scared Gay"" & used as recruiting propaganda by the Lesbian Avengers. If not, the L.A.'s should give it a thought, as this book makes heterosexuality for women out to be something like God's curse on Eve. It manages to bash men in a way that would make Andrea Dworkin proud. Men are shallow, selfish, lying, manipulative & deceitful, according to this ""book"". What is unfortunate is that some young women are going to read it, take it seriously & think this is what all men are really like. This book should have been titled ""What Spoiled, Shallow, Arrogant, New York City Yuppies Want In A Woman - And Why They'll Never Find Her."" Take heart. There are many kind, decent men out there who want commitment & marriage & aren't looking for a breathing Barbie doll - but you're darn well not likely to find 'em in a yuppie bar, ladies! ""Momma, don't let your babies grow up to marry lawyers..."""
2,Arrogant men stroke their egos,"Big deal, so these men have a ""extensive CD collections"" and fancy degrees (as they REPEATEDLY remind us). What they don't have is any moral depth whatsoever.I'm not upset by the information contained in the book, just completely turned off by the shallowness, materialism and ""we are the greatest catches in the history of dating"" tone of the authors. Give us a break and get some humility, guys.Sincerely,A professional woman who owns a mere 16 CDs."
1,PLEASE don't buy this book-these guys don't deserve a cent!,"This book is so bad it can not be rated. The entire book is three New York men telling women why men do what they do and to just suck it up. Men cheat - deal with it. Men just want sex - live with it. Men will ask for your phone number without any intention of calling - get over it. And let's not forget what men want....Men want to watch sports while you sit quietly next them. Men want you to be considerate and nice. Men want you to boost their ego. Men want to keep a little black book. Men want you to perform oral sex. Men want, men want, men want.... And let's not forget about man's fear of rejection - boo hoo. It is no wonder these guys are single - they are pathetic losers."
4,Definitely Funny,"Its like the initial version of ""Hes Just Not That Into You"" but with less bite/blunt, and more justification and humility. Pretty decent read... but again, a strong dose of skepticism well do you well while reading it."
1,Men are pathetic creatures and women must understand that,"This is one of the stupidest books I have come across in a long while. Men are so fouled up they have an innate need to cheat (justified by the authors as wanting variety instead of what it is--abuse), want only beautiful women, and want women who will cater to their every need.Not the most jaded feminist could have ever written such a man-hating tract."
1,Puh-lease!!!!!,"What a crock! These guys are using the oldest tricks in this book.. I Mean, come on. Flirt with a guy so he'll notice you? Right. How about these guys do some of the work themselves? They want us to act like hookers but they won't even pay... I actually bougt this dog book... Girls, don't waste your $..."
2,A mediorcre book that is just commonsense.,"I'm a man who read this book, and I don't understand why so many women hate this book. I'll admit, this book doesn't tell much about how to make a man yours, and it's nothing but commonsense, but it deals mostly with what is on his mind. What were you expecting? Do you hate your boyfriend, or father because he may think the same way?The only problem I had with this book was that these guys gave the impression that all men cheat and want a ""ten"" for a wife or girlfriend. ""Looks matter the most."" There are plenty of men who look for more than just that.Other than that, can any woman tell me why it is wrong to tell what is on his mind? The section: ""the awful truth"" and ""facts about men"" was the best parts of the book, and something that women should know. Why hate a book because of that?Email me."
2,Over Generalizations,"I found this book sitting on my mother's coffee table and read it out of curiosity. While some of it was mildly amusing, it should be noted that it seems more written on how to snag a man with the authors' particular personality types, than how to attract a man in general. Some of this is true for some men, some isn't. I think it's a problem when each gender becomes a stereotype to the other. All men are not any certain way, just as all women aren't any certain way. We are people first, genders second.The few parts of the book that weren't written with this bias seem largely common sense to me, and not especially more true of men than women. Overall, while not quite as demonic as some reviewers make it out to be, the book isn't really worth it. I'm not an expert on relationship self help literature, but I don't think it would be too difficult to find something better."
1,This book was written by men?!?!?!,"Instead of spending your hard-earned money on this book, buy The Rules and The Rules II. The Rules gives much better advice than this book did. I bought it because I figured since men wrote it, it must be accurate. These men are just capitalizing on women's insecurities. Stick to The Rules!"
1,These are typical guys? How sad,"These jerks should speak for themselves. Ofcourse they can find many men to agree with them on..whatever they want to. But not all men are like this and if the authors are average guys, then women want and deserve better than average."
4,"Yes, the truth DOES hurt.","Having skimmed most of the book and read some parts in-depth, I feel the women who give this book bad reviews are afraid of the truth.Instead of reassuring women, this book is a necessary shake-up. And for the women who discount the authors because they're unmarried, I'd like to remind everyone that there are plenty of good catches who haven't met the right person yet :)So, the bottom line - if you want to benefit from the cold, hard truth, read this book. If you'd like to skirt reality for a while longer, this isn't the book for you."
4,What Men Want,"If you really want to know what men want read the book... I found it very true and helpful. If you notice all the positive reviews on this book are by men. The negitive are women. I don't want to know what women think, that is why I bought the book, my girlfriends could never help me understand the man I was dating, this book helped me understand everything and also how to approach non commitment issues... listen up ladies the men are telling you the truth, you want to really know what he is thinking read the book, you may not like it but at least you know the truth"
1,The worst advice a woman can ever get,"Three bachelors got together and decided to write a book about what men want, professional that is. So ladies, here's the brief synopsis: men love oral sex (especially if you let them ejaculate), won't consider one-night-stands as potential girlfriends, and want a girlfriend who's a professional, yet domestic, reserved, yet wild in bed. I got news for you 3 bachelors, with that attitude you will not get more than a shallow, bimbo for a girlfriend and as soon as she gets some brains she will drop you faster than a New York minute. Do you ever wonder why you're still single?"
2,Okay...but nothing new,"This book was decent, but I think I read it too late as so much of the focus seemed to be on babies. Also, I already knew most of the information in the book because I've been looking into Montessori for quite a while now. However, other reviews I've read about this book is that it doesn't explain enough for those new to Montessori. Maybe there is just a problem with the explanations in general. I really wanted to learn more about the actual activities, but I'd say it is okay for someone just learning about Montessori. However, I didn't read the sections that pertain to infants since I have a toddler. My understanding is that some of the advice is controversial--such as letting a baby cry it out (something I'm totally against and most research is too). I think it does a decent job of introducing the basic principles but I'm looking for a book about Montessori activities step-by-step."
2,Disappointing,"If you are completely new to child development and the montessori method than Montessori from the Start would probably serve you well as a fairly accessible introduction. I, however, was hoping for either a more in depth explanation of montessori principles relevant to this early age group or specific exercises and games to play at home. In my opinion this book was rather superficial with lots of repetition and unhelpful complaints about parenting practices today. There are better books out there on the theory and better books out there if you are looking for practical tips."
1,Don't waste your money or traumatize your child with this drivel,"Rife with poor writing and outdated, harmful advice, this book isn't worth reading even if it comes to you free. There are far too many wonderful Montessori books out there to waste even a second on this garbage. This book might be fine if you want emotionally distant, manipulated children, which isn't the Montessori way to begin with. The writers support many peculiar and scientifically contravened ideas. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Angry that I wasted my money,"[...]Montessori is not a parenting style, attachment parents or more mainstream parents can all apply montessori methods at home. How long the baby nurses, where they sleep, at what age they sleep through the night, none of that is montessori! Different cultures parent differently, and one of Maria Montessori's main criteria for montessori education was that it be relevant to the era and culture that the child lives in. She never went into specifics on any of the crap that these authors go into.I think it is wrong for them to infiliterate their own parenting tactics under the banner of Montessori methods, I hope to find a book that is more relevant and true to what it advertises that it is on it's cover and cover notes."
4,Badly underrated album that deserves to be heard,"Not to be confused with his signature 1990 album, Johnny Gill's 1983 debut album might disappoint fans of New-Jack Swing, but certainly not those who love the bubblegum-type sound of early New Edition (which didn't feature Gill when this album was released). It did yield one minor R&B hit ""Super Love"", is well-produced throughout, and features two great songs in ""Guilty"" and ""Half-Steppin."" This album is difficult to find (even on tape) so if you see it, grab it."
4,sizes are too small,"I bought the LARGE size of this hat for my son when he was 18 months old and it fit him well. It was a fantastic hat for him and I really liked the coverage and the great shading for his eyes. However, he is now three years old and while he is still wearing the three year old sized shorts and shirt I bought him at the same time as this hat, he has outgrown the hat completely and it cannot be forced onto his head. I have trouble believing that this size would fit any child of 8-14 when it is too small for my, admittedly large, three year old. I would like very much to buy him another one, but there is now no size that would fit."
3,"I like Pires, but...","Here she employs almost irritatingly slow tempi in the first and third movements of the concerto maybe in order to produce crystal tones, which was pretty succesful in her performance of Chopin nocturnes. But, unfortunately, I feel that her beautiful tones don't compensate for the musical momentum, which is desperately essential to this concerto that was written by young and ambitious Chopin."
4,I looked everywhere for this song,"I looked everywhere for this song. It is a single CD. ie, it has different versions of the song. Very nice."
2,earasable,well you can earase a lot of stuff if you want to i mean if you write alot its helpful. you know what i mean?
5,Excellent,"Great movie regarding love, compassion, commitment, dedication, and above all we see how God works in our life for His glory"
1,Ruination of Perfectly Good Christian Novel,"My wife read the book and was very much looking forward to going to see the movie. However, the movie was not true to the book in most of the christian aspects. Items such as the chikds cousins teaching him how to pray and more of the part where the family was in Haiti and the childs interactions with the Haitian children. The movie producers decided to only make the movie for a secular movie audience and left out all of the important christian aspects of the book. If you read the book first and then saw what they produced as a movie, you would seriously be disappointed in the movie. They ruined a perfectly good christian novel. I can't believe that Mrs. Kingsbury actually let the movie producers get away with what they left out."
4,Hmmmmm?,"Great movie unless you read the book first! I feel Karen Kingsbury was not true to her book. The personalities of the adoptive parents were not developed and made to look selfish in the movie, whereas the birth parents were made out to be hero's. Did Karen have second thoughts about how she portrayed both sets of parents in her book? And where was the basis of all of this...God?"
3,GOOD movie,THIS MOVIE WAS A GOOD MOVIE BUT THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A CHRISTIAN MOVIE AND WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT NOONE ECKNOWLEDGED GOD. I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT SOME OF THESE MOVIES JUST THROW A LITTLE BIT OF CHURCH IN IT AND IT BECOMES A CHRISTIAN MOVIE.IT HAD WONDERFUL ACTING BUT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN FAMILIES RELYING ON CHRIST OR TURNING TO CHRIST.
4,I liked it,The product was in very good condition. The movie itself was not a very good movie. The book was better.
3,DVD Dandelion Dust,"Like Dandelion Dust is a dvd that relates the effort that the main characters, a married couple, cope with having adopted a child and not being able to procreate on their own. I think that the film would have benefitted from tighter editing as it seems to become repetitive in relating the story of infertility. It could be upsetting to those couples who are in the process of trying to adopt. Otherwise the film does depict the trial and error of adoptions which can cause upsetting consequences for the natural birth mother and the adoptive parents. Anna M."
1,Like Dandelion Dust,"I was EXTREMELY disappointed in this DVD rendition of Karen Kingsbury's book. I am a big fan of hers and, after reading the book, decided to use the DVD as the basis for our church fellowship meeting. What a shock to find that the screen writers had removed any reference to faith, which deeply penetrates Kingsbury's books and serves as an inspiration to believers struggling with daily challenges in their lives. I had to paraphrase parts of the book to explain to others how different the DVD was from Kingsbury's theme. I was going to donate the DVD to our church library, but will not be doing that now that I know that all of Kingsbury's references to faith have been removed form the DVD. I won't watch it again, so it will wind up in the trash...what a waste of money!"
2,Not the best...,"I mean, I guess the writers were trying to get at something... But it wasn't well portrayed through the movie. I do regret buying it. I only watched it the first time I got it. Eh. That's my general opinion on this DVD. EH."
2,Disappointing compared to the book,"If you just see the movie and haven't read the book it seems like a fantastic movie, however, if you've read the book you will know that the ending fell flat compared to the book. Molly and Jack became Christians at the end of the book and this was not the way the movie ended. The book focused on God's redemptive power. I really enjoy Karen Kingsbury novels, but the movie version of a terrific book by her was a huge disappointment."
4,Cute and Good Quality,Fit like a charm. Doesn't slip off which is often the problem with kids slippers. Good quality.
5,Individuality,This is an exceptional book. It is particularly interesting for those that are interested on evolutionary and developmental biology. It will also be helpful for those that think they know what an individual is.
5,Awesome workout!,"This is an advanced level workout but you can follow the modifier for a less intense version. The music is great and while Amy is not the best at cuing, you will be fine once you learn the moves and do the workout a few times. There are 7 different premixes and a very helpful detailed description of each premix."
2,You'll Sweat but I couldn't get past the Terrible Form,"First of all if you're looking for something short, this is not it. The workout is 89 minutes. I needed something I could work out to 30-40 mins a few times a week. But the thing that bothered me the most about this workout was that Ms. Bento has terrible form. If she ever actually punched someone with those punches she would hurt herself. I have a black belt in martial arts and ten years of training and I could not get past how bad her form was--I would be afraid that viewers would inadvertently hurt themselves imitating her. She has clearly not had any formal training at all in throwing kicks or punches. It is extremely disturbing. I definitely got a good sweat on but could not get past her terrible form. I had to modify almost everything so that I didn't injure myself by following her poor form."
1,A total waste of money.,"This looks like it was written on the fly. It is filled with generalized topics with nary a detail on how to do anything. A majority of the book is about starting a small business, this in generalized form as well. The last 15-20 pages discuss apartment property management, again in only a generalized context. Spend your money some place else or send it to me......"
1,Need to find good book and How to Manage Property Mgt.,"I did not purchase this book but based on the previous critic I guess I will not, but that still leaves me empty, can anyone recommend a book on How to start your own busines on Property Management."
4,"Fast Sam,CoolClyde,and Stuff",I read this book because it was an assignment for my English class.I think young adults can relate to this book because there are some events that occured in this book that they may have experienced.
2,"Ok, but not quite up to par.","This book was served a good point, but the plot was what really hurt it. The plot developed slowly and the climax was not much really maximum intinsity or enjoyment. The end was to slow and depressing. The group in the book call themselves the ""Good People"", but it seems when the interfear things just get worse."
4,"Fast Sam, Cool Clyde and Stuff","What an awesome book. This novel takes place in New York City during the 70's. It is very entertaining. I am a teacher in an inner city school and I had my students read this. They literally would laugh aloud while reading it. Although it takes place during the 70's, there are still issues in which my students could relate. I definitely recommend this novel to middle school children, both urban and suburban. Hats off to Walter Dean Myers!"
4,Always a pleasure to see and hear YES,"While YES plays perfectly (of course), the makers of the DVD could have cleaned the sound a little better. Aside from this, the cutting of the acoustic first half of 'All Good People', and annoying early 70's camera effects, the band JAMS!"
2,Not recommended,"As a Board Registered Art Therapist and instructor, I made the error of recommending this book to students before I actually laid eyes on it. What a mistake! When one of my students, also a trained art therapist, received it, we literally laughed. This is such a poor example of literature on how to understand children's art. Even more disturbing were the strange pseudo-drawings of children's art made by the authors. Clearly not recommended when there are so many better books available."
2,Not a realistic tool for screening child artwork,"As a graduate art therapy student who has been working with children for years, I found this book to have very few realistic examples of children's artwork. Many of the images were clearly created by an adult and therefore provided very little help as to what to look for in childrens art. In addition to the poor images, I didn't find much of the information to have therapeutic value."
2,These are not new techniques,"Hey, it is erroneous to say that these are ""new techniques,"" when in fact they are 50 to 60 years old. What the authors did was do a new study with these techniques and then try to offer a convincing book on analyzing children's drawings. The problem is, it is not very convincing. One cannot use the indicators the authors note to establish child abuse in a slick fashion. We already know that the techniques the authors based this study on are not reliable, so they really just built on what was already unreliable to begin with. I understand their need to help children in distress, but that was not really accomplished here."
2,cookbook approach to children's expressive work,"As a therapist I was very disappointed by this book because of its cookbook approach to children's drawings. Using lists of characteristics may suit the adult need to justify a diagnosis, but is this a real service to children? I think not and was very disturbed by the authors' view of children's expressive work. An antidote to this book is Understanding Children's Drawings/Malchiodi; this book presents a humanistic, respectful view of children's drawings, one which I can comfortably use in my own work with troubled or abused children."
2,Simplistic view of the meaning of children's drawings,"I have to agree with the reviewer who said this is a cookbook approach to children's drawings. While there is need for ways to understand what children are communicating through their art, it is not through rating isolated parts or characteristics of their drawings. This book is about how drawings can be useful in determining child abuse, but this seems like an abusive way of using children's art for diagnosis. This book unfortunately does not treat children's expressive work with the respect and dignity each child deserves and I was left wishing that the authors were a bit more sensitive in their approach."
2,Comedy Lover,"My husband and I did not enjoy this particular comedy skit as much as we have enjoyed other Steven Wright pieces. The ending video was very dark and serious: not what we were intending to view within a ""comedy""."
3,Still funny but a bit different,"The strengths in Wright's early work were that his humor was much smarter and much cleaner than most comics, while being fall-off-the-chair funny.This work is that funny--Wright's genius for wit is still working. But he relies much more than he used to on vulgarity.And then there's the short film. I'd like to watch that with someone who gets it, because I didn't. It was all Wright's blandness without any of his brilliance. I didn't even make it through."
2,Disappointing,"The standup comedy at the beginning was OK, but not the best Steven Wright material that I have heard. However, most of the video is a movie that he made that was very boring and not funny at all. The ad for the video did not mention this movie (except maybe in very small print) and it took up most of the DVD.The jokes in the comedy routine at the beginning seemed more like filler to make a DVD than his original humor. There is short video of an old standup routine from years ago at the end of the DVD, but the quality is poor and you can hardly understand what he is saying.I think that Steven Wright is one of the funniest comedians around. Several years ago, I caught him on a radio station in Missoula, Montana, and I had to stop the car because I was laughing so hard that I thought that I would get into an accident. However, this DVD lack a lot of the originality and quality that Steven used to have."
2,Blink and you'll miss it,I love Wrights wit but just to be clear here is what you REALLY get on this DVD:20 mins of Standup50 mins of some werid movie he made5 mins of standup recorded in 1988 with a handheld.Now more of the first and less of the 2nd two and this would have been good.
1,Sad,"I am a huge Steven Wright fan, but this latest effort doesn't live up to his usual comic genius. I kept waiting for it to get funny. It's sad to see such a decline."
3,"Great Content, Same as ""I still have a pony""","This was a very funny DVD and I'm a big Steven Wright fan, but I was really disappointed that this was the same performance as that found on his recent CD ""I still have a pony."" For many people this will not be a problem, but it is something to be aware of before you buy."
3,Disappointing,"I purchased this disc thinking that it was an actual stand-up routine. I does indeed have a stand-up routine on the disc but only about half of it. The other half is a ""movie"" that is not that funny and makes no sense at all. Pick another Steven Wright release."
1,Mind-numbing...,"I was introduced to Steve Wright's work during an acupuncture/massage therapy session & laughed until the tears were running down my face; maybe it was a temporary euphoria thing (or maybe this vid was not representative of the rest of his stuff - I hope not!), but it was mind-numbingly boring. I kept waiting for the slyly relevant zingers I remembered from the CD I'd heard, but they were woefully scarce. I even closed my eyes to ascertain if it was a visual thing. Not so. Perhaps I should try a CD or another vid."
1,is this not closed captoned?,"is this not closed captoned???English subtittles???he was just on David Letterman and it WAS captioned but amazon is not showing this DVD is.They say practice makes perfect, but since nobodies perfect, I stopped practicingA friend of mine has a trophy wife, although it's apparent its not first place"
4,Variety?,"I love Natacha Atlas. She is the only artist from the area that you can listen for hours without getting bored. Ten minutes of Nancy Ajram or Nawal al Zoghby and I am done. My only issue with this CD is its lack of variety! Natacha could easily have a 2 CD ""Best of"" set(the one I made is three), so why does she then put three different version of just one song on this disk?There is a lot of great material out there by Natacha and I think she wasted a great opportunity to put out a CD, and wasted it by providing numerous recordings of one track.Either way, it is a good CD, and I cannot wait for her newest project to come out."
3,Definitly Different.,"I LOVE her cover of ""You Only Live Twice"". Haunting and surreal at the same time. To me, it's the best song on the CD. I'd buy the whole CD for that song."
5,I need MORE!!!,oh my gosh these are the best books ever... i even did each book 3 times for book reports.. i love themm... i read the whole book in one night and thats not to common for me... i LOVE them... and now i need to read more... because i have another book report but i read them all already :(... so now i have nothing to read... so im just going to do survivor... for the fourth time :P... soon im going to get caught so pleaseeee make more and add on to the series... PLEASEEEE
3,Beginning Sorting Set,"The description of this item does not say sorting tray not included. When you order this, realize all you will receive is the plastic counting items. The picture is a little deceiving, but the assorted counting items are nice."
1,Quacker Snack Mix,"I purchased what I thought was the Munchies Snack Mix pictured and was disappointed when I received the Quacker Snack Mix (Baked Cheddar). This item did not contain anything I thought I was in the picture displayed. If I hadn't opened and given some to co-workers I would have returned for a refund. Please do not picture different items than what you are actually offering as this is deceitfulQuaker Snack Mix, Baked Cheddar, 1.75-Ounce Bags (Pack of 60)."
4,Rough n ready,"Ok, ""Right on the tip of my tongue"" is one of my all-time favourite pop-soul songs, so I was longing to get this album when I discovered the tracks were newly remastered and mixed by none other than the legendary Tom Moulton. And ""Right..."" sounds absolutely fantastic in full stereo! Apart from Brenda's gorgeous version of ""Don't Make Me Over"" there's nothing else here that rivals the title track, but the music is nothing less than energetic and soulful, if often very rough in performance. Worth buying as a good document of earnest yet fun soul music."
5,Refreshing and interestingly different,"It's so nice to see an applique pattern book that isn't the same ol'. The designs are unique as I have never seen these flowers before. Linda Poole also shows how to set these bouquets into circles, ovals and frames. I like that a beginner to an expert can have choices and her technique is one that I just learned in her class and love it! It travels easily and makes so much sense."
5,different and delightful,"This book is for those of us who want to do something new.Full of colorful flowers and other turkish designs done in bright colors and with glue stick applique approach. Well written and Makes me think of a ""Baltimore"" quilt done in these flowers. Well written and easy step by step instructions.Even those who do little applique this will show you a new way and a unique type of quilt."
4,Factory of Cunning,"An epistolary novel that offers a ""sequel"" to Les liaisons dangereuses.I found Factory clever, often devastatingly funny, wonderfully differentiated in its voices and considerable in its tension -- the latter two qualities being difficult to achieve in epistolary novels. Some of the plot elements -- Violet's experiences and the long-lost sister -- are well-worn, but the manner of telling is so fresh that it doesn't really matter. ""Mrs. Fox"", unrepentantly awful and cheerfully unsinkable, is a gem.I think some readers will have trouble following the plotline, especially in the beginning, and the quick-spoken, intricate period diction, particularly in Mrs. Fox's voice, may lose some, but the book rewards close attention. It would appeal to readers who enjoyed books like SLAMMERKIN and THE DRESS LODGER, but its tone is far more arch.Recommended."
1,Factory of Cunning,"I could not even finish this book, which in and of itself is not normal for me. I kept waiting for it to pick up but sadly it did not. I cannot even give it one star. Although I had to pick one or I couldn't go on."
1,I would rather poke out my eyes with hot knives.,"I would rather poke out my eyes with hot knives than read this book again. I don't think it would be possible for me to care any less about the characters. The writing is not enjoyable to read. It is as if the author was doing an exercise in a writing - perhaps becoming bored with writing, or maybe this was her thesis in getting her masters. I love to read good books, heck - even mediocre beach-reads are OK. If you are stranded on a deserted island and have only this book as entertainment - take a walk and look for pretty shells."
1,"No, How True!","Not How Rude, How True! You know that a book is truly dreadful when you chose to shut it and concentrate on the traffic backed up on the New Jersey Turnpike rather than be tortured with its labored language and disgusting olafactory scenery even one more second. I agree, the author appears to have been working on an academic degree, and I can't imagine the reader who enjoys turning to the ""glossary"" to see the myriad definitions of obscure fabrics while really engrossed in a gripping novel. There has to be a reason that there are so many used copies available two months after its debut...."
5,Thoughts From A Wing Commander Fan!,"Hi! I reckon this soundtrack rocks! I have been a fan of Wing Commander since I can remember, so it is great to hear music appropriate for that universe. I have seen the film and currently own it on video, it is great, but the music is way better! However, the CD is too short and is missing some vital cues, such as the torpedo battle with the Kilrathi half-way through the film. I noticed this music while watching the movie and was a little annoyed when I discovered it was not included on the CD, however it still rocks so YAY!"
4,Worth listening to...,"Loved the games, in fact one of the reasons i loved them was because of the music scores. The movie is not worth giving a comment, but the soundtrack is pretty good, but honestly i think the soundtrack in the games are better, especially WC III, it's simply amazing..."
2,recordingto a disapointment,"the notes have been compressed, so if you have a real stereo not some sony out of the box system you wiil be disapointed. all low notes are gone and the brass has a tin quality."
5,One of the best soundtracks I've heard.,"This soundtrack rocks! My opinion of the movie it was put to is different, however. This soundtrack saved the movie from falling, bigtime!"
1,what are these other reviews talking about???,"Not only was this movie terrible, but the soundtrack was equally awful. The video game has better music, a better story, and better effects than the movie could ever hope to have!"
4,Even better for fans of Built to Spill & Beat Happening,"I just heard about this band recently, so I don't know a whole lot about the Halo Benders.Built to Spill and Beat Happening have been two bands I have enjoyed for a few years now. When I found out about The Halo Benders I just had to order a couple.The combination of Calvin Johnson's(Beat Happening) voice along w/ Doug Martsch's(Built to Spill) vocals intrigued me to hear it for myself.And it does work. Maybe sounds a little ""out there"" to some- but hey that's what I like.Calvin Johnson has a really deep voice and Doug, well it's hard to describe his voice, but it's lighter(or shinier) with a lot more range and melody. Sometimes they use their styles together or separate, makes for an interesting listen. Singing in different pitches.My favorite song is (""single""): ""Don't Touch My Bikini""Might sound a little challenging for listeners, if you're not familiar with these two bands(Built to Spill & Beat Happening).- To me it's a joy!"
4,"Okay, alright!","this is the perfect cd to listen to in june, with your shirt off, after a few beers, while cutting your cool indie rock friends hair and talking about how you have no money for toppings on the pizza. sound gross? yeah, it is. a great wispy pop cd that is hummable and amiable and will make you smile and want to start a band called the Malo Henders."
3,Some Good Stuff,"Some songs are harder to get into than others. But, still worth a listen in the car. Kinda takes me back a little. :P"
4,Can't go wrong with Halo Benders,"Want to hear something that you will never hear on FM radio? Here you go. Martsch and Johnson are a unique combination. Not as good as The Rebel's Not In, but that's hard to top."
5,Don't Touch My Bikini!,"This CD is good for a long car trip. It's cool indie rock with a 60s feel. All the songs are good, but the second's my favorite. There's one that reminds me of the Clash...but that's probably just me."
3,5 for Content; 1 for Poor book production,"This is a must have book for any Elvis fan. Unfortunately, the paperback version is a poor cousin of the original hardback. First, the paperback was produced from the same proofs as the hardback, but on smaller stock. As a result many pictures - and a few captions - have been cropped; this is quite irritating. In addition, the binding is awful. After only a few weeks perusing it, the pages in my copy began to fall out. The publishers should not have allowed this to happen to such a superb reference work.I hate to harp on the production values, because I do love what Jorgensen has done here, but advise you to order the hardback instead."
3,Not the masterpiece it could've been...,"This book started off so good that I couldn't put it down. The author leaves no stone unturned in the 50's. Everything you wanted to know about how Elvis, the colonel, and RCA went about their business is there in black and white. You find out how and why every recording was recorded. You'll feel like you were there in the studio with Elvis and also behind the desk in the colonel's office.But come 1961 or '62 this book starts slipping big time, especially pursuant to Elvis' movie recordings. Whereas for the 50's the author wrote paragraph after paragraph detailing each recording session, for certain 60's sessions all he did was give the statistics (song, publisher, catalog number, etc.) Near the end of the 60's and on into the 70's the author gets back on track and gives us plenty of background. But I can't help but be disappointed with approximately 1962-1966."
5,Essential Elvis,"Great book. Honest - not sleazy, not pandering. The sessions are fascinating, the studio people and musicians that mattered get their dues and the hard slog behind making it all sound so good, (as well as the causes behind the otherwise inexplicable trash) becomes clear. This one's for the music."
4,Remembering 'The King',"This is a very informative references book about Elvis. I was wanting to find a good book on Elvis Presley and this was the best one that I saw. I can tell that it was a book of passion for the people who worked on it.There are not as many pictures as I would have liked ( I love picture books. ) However, it is very interesting and one of the better materials I have found about the man.The writers are also not afraid of showing Elvis's downward spiral during the last few years of his life.Like Buddy Holly and John Lennon. A lot of people still believe that Elvis left this Earth too soon.But the good thing though is that we still have his music and memories. That still make people happy even to day and I hope they still will. In the future."
3,Day-Timer Universal Checkbook Holder,"Product is nice, but the cost to ship it was almost as much as the cost of the product. Not worth the total cost."
4,Universal Checkbook Holder,"The checkbook holder was the right size for what I needed. I don't carry checks but needed something to put my registry in and to hold receipts and small items like paperclips, stamps, change, id, and credit cards. And you can just carry the holder for quick trips instead of a purse. It was a little pricey but worth it for my needs."
3,great recording should have been better,"I love these mini LPs from Japan. I also love the Count Basie Band. But our friends from Japan messed this one up pretty badly. First, the original Roulette label used for the CD face is the orange and yellow edition, which is NOT the original red, yellow, blue & green bars over white label. Second, the sound is not the beautifully restored sounds you will get from Mosiac Records. Instead, it is an older master which was used on the 1987-1988 Vogue releases from France. So as the other reviewer points out, you will hear a lot of tape dropouts. This is particularly notable this Basie series of CDs from Japan. Hopefully (but I doubt it will happen) the Japanese company will re-release the ENTIRE line of Basie Roulette recordings (and Maynard too, please!) and get it right the second time around."
2,weak parts of a good product,This is a nice product but the two clips broke off very easily. The base of the clips that attach to the body are very weak. It is just a matter of replacing them with stronger alligator clips. The store that sold this product mailed free of charge 6 replacement clips. Customer service was very prompt and courteous correcting this problem. I would buy from this store again.
3,No son muy resistentes,"Compre el set para mi hijo de 3 años de edad, el vaso se le cayo y ya esta roto. El plastico es muy tostado. son muy lindos pero no duraderos."
4,"Fun, but lacks in Competitive Edge","This is a good start for someone who wants to start their pokemon collecting and playing. Other than that, this product isn't where to spend your money: The exclusive cards are very weak, the rest of the cards in the deck aren't strong at all, and this deck costs a full 3$ (on average) more than the other, better pre-constructed deck.I would suggest getting the EX Team Rocket Returns ""James Theme"" or EX Dragon ""Windblast"". ... or EX Hidden Legends ""Wish Maker"".(these are the best Decks, but the other ones all serve as good templates to start constructing your own deck)."
4,Wonderful,"This is a great CD. With these three artists together on one recording, how could go wrong!"
3,Not bad.,Good blues but a little disappointing on the sonics. I bought if for Tab Benoit's cover of Willie Nelson's Nighlife. Decent live version of this song.
2,THIS CD SHOULD HIT THE ROAD!,"I got this one to complete my Debbie Davies collection. This album sounds like it was hastily thrown together to make a quick buck on three well known artists. The audio is ok, but the bass is over mixed and thumpy. The guitars are under mixed and have a boring dead sound. Good songs are: NIGHT LIFE, LUBERTA, I CAN'T AFFORD MYSELF, I PUT A SPELL ON YOU, and HOMESICK FOR THE ROAD."
5,salsberry soothin,"The best album on the K records label, Dub Narcotic is my drug. This album will shake your brain loose. This album mimics a Dub Narcotic show and is great."
5,"Jake, I love the tacos...","Oh, my god...I can't believe that people actually reviewed this video! I thought my best friend and I were the only State-ers out there...I love this video, and I am sooo saddened by the fact that The State is no longer on TV. I recommend this video to anyone who....has eyes. I think it's one of those things that everyone needs to see just once!"
5,MTV:The State: Skits and Stickers,"the state is an absolute work of comedic ingenuity....this tape is a must for any state fan, they collect some of the best sketches (tacos, monkey torture, porcupine racetrack, to name a few) along with three never released skits...the state's dry humour and sharp, cunning wit has an air of sophistication to it with a mixture of childlike antics to back it up....i've spent years memorizing and recreating episodes with friends...great fun for all! ...hurry up, though, this tape is out of print and is a rare species.....absolute brilliance!"
5,"a must for ""State ""fans!","This video is such a hilarious collection of the very best State sketches. If you remember watching the State fondly on MTV as I did, you'll love this video. THe funniest sketches are Pants, Lowell Maximum Security Prison, Jesus meets Louie, The Jew THe Italian and the red-head gay, and the grand finale . . . Porcupine Racetrack!! This video is a must for ""The State"" Fans."
5,You'll get your ten bucks worth . . .,"When I found out this video existed, salvaging skits from HANDS DOWN the best show ever to appear on television, I was happier than the Redhead gay. My only regret is that the Toothbrush skit is omitted (my all time fave). But I could watch the Taco Delivering Mailman 30,000 times and I'd still be on the floor. ""I'm outta here!"""
5,mtv sickens me.,"I've looked for a state tape for years finally found it and it is quite simply the funniest sketch comedy around. Now I don't know the specifics but if mtv simply decided to cancel the show they don't know what they had... It is super witty and yet extremely bass, which for my money is the best kind of comedy. The real greatness of the state is it's pace. This video is a mile a minute assualt of doug, barry and lavon and louie... in closing where is that great skit of the variety show... it was a pretty strange one but maaaaaaaaaaaaan was it funny... ""would you stop kissing my former wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiife""... pure hilarity... if you like sketch comedy just order you won't be dissappointed..."
3,where's the muppet,"Although i do love The State very much, there are too many good sketches left out and not so funny stuff put in, like the Porcupine Race sketch. What happened to the Bluberry Johnson sketch, the monkeys doing it sketch, and the muppet hunting sketch? They really need to make a second tape with the classics on it."
5,oh my god!,oh my god! the state was my favorite show and i had taped all the episodes but over the years of leanding them to my friends i only have one. this video brought back my favorites that i totally forgot about. you need this!
2,Misleading cover!,"A book on human morfologic evolutionand ancient tools (stones).A few words on culture precisely.If you don&#65533;t want to read aboutbones, stones, more bones and morestones read instead ""The Prehistoryof the Mind"", by Steven Mithen."
2,"Misleading Title, May be good otherwise","Looks like I will be the minority voice in these ratings. While _The Dawn of Human Culture_ does cover many aspects of human evolution clearly and well, explaining theories and pitfalls, and including a lot of clear sketches, most of the book is just that, a rehash of evolutionary theory. The authors don't get to the subject at hand until very late in the book (in fact, I haven't finished reading yet, and only the knowledge that they do eventually make some sort of a point is keeping me reading it). I think I would have enjoyed the book more if I had been better prepared going in, because I kept expecting to read something really new and interesting."
3,Interesting facts mixed with dull visuals,"The narration of this series is fascinating. I enjoyed hearing the unusual facts presented by the narrator. However, the photography was, for the most part, dull. My parents' home video of riding a train was only marginally more boring. My four-year-old son adores this series and plays the tape over and over again."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I ordered the wrong product, too small for what I was looking for. Needed big butt cheeks for Halloween and this didn't do it. Also, you can't sit because the buns are hallow and will leave dents. It wasn't expensive, so it wasn't too much of a loss."
5,Lost Early Scruffs Classic,"Recorded amid a decaying post-60s Memphis music scene, the early Scruffs struggled to create an antidote to the nightmarish boogie and southern rock scene that had replaced it with power pop that echoed a mix of the Beatles and what was then popular in the U.K. At this time Alex Chilton was all but forgotten and could be seen clawing his way up to a stage to attempt to join the group for a song, rarely attempted to record anthing, Chris Bell died in a car wreck, and Andrew Loog Oldham cut a few songs with Van Duren at Ardent and left without paying the bill, John Fry had forgotten about Ardent and rarely showed up at the office, had lost interest in music. Tracks 1--10 were recent Exeter graduate Stephen Burns recording without a band, and the final lineup came together for tracks 11--24 at a time before record executives even knew there was a New Wave to ignore."
3,A good buy for the price,"The first minute it runs 3 mph. By the fourth minute, it runs 2.5 mph. For the fifth and sixth minute, it runs 2 mph. At the seventh minute, it runs 1 mph and requires a lot of steering for left-right drift. It will travel over one thousand feet.The remote range is about three hundred feet.It does not run in reverse (backwards).The boat battery is rechargeable. You can buy extra batteries at amazon.com to extend your boating time."
4,EXCELLANT IF YOU NEED TO RESEARCH THE AREAS OF THE BRAIN,EXCELLANT IF YOU HAVE RESEARCH TO DO ON BRAIN TUMORS OR THEIR TREATMENT
5,one of the best trance-techno albums I own.,"I liked every last one of the songs, some more than others. This album has the right blend of everything. The songs have an awesome beat and at the same time it doesn't start to grate on your nerves like a lot of techno songs."
5,Old School George Acosta,"One of the BEST CD compilations by George Acosta. This CD has taken me back to my younger more vibrant days. This CD ranges from some of the best house to a lot of great trance. Different from the other types of music that George has become accustomed to playing, this CD in my opinion is his BEST. Check it out. You will not be disappointed."
2,Not quite what it pretends to be...,"This book is not what it bills itself as; that is, a guide to wedding planning. It's really more of a humorous or satirical book ABOUT planning a wedding, or a spoof on more traditional wedding guides. It won't help you plan at all, though it may make you laugh sometimes, which could be usefull if you've o.d.-ed on more conventional wedding advice. However, beware: it has an annoying tendancy to sink into hackneyed gender stereotypes-- all women want to get married and have lavish, traditional ceremonies, all men avoid matrimony unless tricked or manipulated into it by scheming women, and, once snared, they are completely uninterested in the event itself, etc., etc. If you go for that kind of humor, it may amuse you, but don't purchase it if you want practical wedding planning help"
2,Amateurish,"Not much fun in producing the mediocre. Definitely not professional as advertised. Try another product, or stick to Microsoft Publisher."
5,Now I feel like I really know R. L. Stine!,"Reading this book was like having dinner with R. L. Stine. I live in Columbus, Ohio and R. L. was raised right outside the city limits.This book is told through his voice and being the great story teller that he is, he captivated me with even the smallest facts about his career.He is honest about his downs and ups and is humble about his own success.I was so sorry when this book ended, it felt like my friend had to leave after sharing such a wonderful visit with me.This is a great resource for book or oral reports!"
1,"Re-Recordings, Don't Bother","All these tracks are re-recordings and NOT the originals. If you like the hits of 1970, and who doesn't - - pick-up Billboard's 1970 compilation or anything from the Time-Life collections. I also recommend the ""Now and Then"" soundtrack. Great stuff.I was looking for the original of ""I Just Can't Help Believing"" by B.J. Thomas and found it on a 1995 release called ""Best of B.J. Thomas"" on the Laser Light label. Even iTunes didn't have the original."
1,I should'a read the previous review !!!!!!!!,"I was thoroughly disappointed with this CD as most, if not all, of the tracks are NOT the ORIGINAL hit recordings. I try to read reviews, etc. to determine if CDs have the original recordings that made them hits but must have had a lapse in this case. In my book re-recordings, even by the original artists, just don't cut it, no matter how ""good"" they are."
2,Flashing Back,"Your typical complelation album, replete with the obligatory hits of the period. The selection of songs is acceptable, and does adequately reflect the period. If you were able to enjoy even a couple of these hits when they were initially released it may be worth the expense normally associated with such albums. If you are looking for something that has great substance and impact, look elsewhere. Listening to this album is just like turning on the AM radio, but without the advertisements or annoying DJ."
1,Yuck,"This was overwhelming with the smell of lavender even though it is one of the last ingredients. Way, way too ""perfumy"" for me to even use. If you are sensitive to essential oils that are not made properly and are too ""perfumy"" don't buy this."
2,$1000?,hahahaha one thousand dollars! The movie is fun but it's not worth a thousand dollars! How ridiculous. I hope that is rectified shortly.
5,"1'000,000 Fans no pueden estar equivocados","Si alguien decia, que Bon Jovi era solo It's My Life, con esa caja está muy equivocado. 4 CD's + 1 DVD. En total 50 canciones, 38 de las cuales, nunca escuchadas antes. Y las 38 dignas de estar en un cd, pero no lo hicieron, como dijo Jon: ""Por no encajar con el significado del disco"". Quizá no, pero no hace falta decir (mas bien sea escuchar) que canciones como Last Man Standing, Radio Saved My Life Tonight o River Runs Dry, serian un exito asegurado.Una buena compra para los aficionados a la BUENA música, y obligatorio para todo aquél que sea fan del mejor grupo de rock. 20 años y 100,000,000 millones de discos vendidos lo demuestran."
5,bon jovi always,"Bon Jovi is my all time favorite artist and group and they kicked butt again. But I have to wonder how many other songs they did that aren't realease, I would love to listen to them as well. I highly recommend it. I would give it 100 stars out of five."
5,BON JOVI ROCKS MY WORLD,"BON JOVI IS THE BEST ROCK BAND EVER.I WILL ALWAYS LOVE BON JOVI. THIS BOX SET ROCKS THESE GUYS WILL ROCK YOUR WORLD JON, RICHIE DAVE and TICO WILL BE HERE FOREVER. THERE IS NOTHING BUT GREAT SONGS AND POWERFUL VOCALS.ON CD 3 YOU WILL HEAR TICO, RICHIE AND DAVE SING. RICHIE SAMBORA SINGS A VERY POWERFUL BALLAD IF I CAN'T HAVE YOUR LOVE THAT WILL KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF!!!! TICO TORRES SINGS ONLY IN MY DREAMS HIS VOICE IS W O W!! AND DAVID BRYAN SOUNDS LIKE ELTON JOHN SINGING MEMPHIS LIVES IN ME.BON JOVI MEANS ALOT TO ME I WILL LOVE BON JOVI TILL THE I DIE"
2,I know why most of this stuff was unreleased,"It seems that the guys in Bon Jovi actually have a taste in music. Had they released much of the stuff on this box set as studio albums, they would have had a much shorter career than the 20+ years that they've been around. I've always wondered why so many box sets were typically an overproduced greatest hits package, and now I know why they are. 90% of the tracks on this set are horrible. Bon Jovi is a rock band, and yet this box set is made up of terrible ballad after ballad. I'm afraid that this is one collection that will be collecting dust amongst my CDs after one very long and painful listening trying to find at least a few worthy tracks to listen to multiple times. Most fans will be better off sticking to their true studio albums and leaving this set to hardcore fans."
4,THE BEST OF THE REST,"I have been a fan of Bon Jovi since about 1988 (I was 8 at the time), but I must admit that I lost faith in the band after the exellent Keep The Faith. Not that their albums have been bad since then. But they have only contained a small amount of the great songs that we all know that they can write. It's not because I'm against bands growing.I got the box set as a Christmas present ( I am a fan after all), and it totally suprised me. These songs are great!! There are of course non of the big hit songs like Living On A Prayer and Wanted Dead or Alive, but still great songs. This box set made believe in Bon Jovi again and actually fall in love all over again with the band. the only thing that bugs me now is the fact that they left some of these great songs of their weaker albums. But hey, Jon wanted to leave of Living On A Prayer on Slippery when Wet."
2,"1,000,000,000 CAN BE WRONG!","I loved Bon Jovi growing up and was excited that there were all these unreleased songs that everyone seems to be saying are worth something. Unfortunately, the set is good only as proof as to why the songs never made it on their previous albums. They are simply inferior. I urge Bon Jovi fans to listen to some selection before forking the $40+ dollars to buy the set."
4,A Revelation,"This box set revealed to me a couple of interesting bits of information about this band that I was unaware of. One, not only is David Bryan an excellent keyboard player he can really sing as well. Two, the drummer sounds like Tom Waits.Effin' A! :)"
2,Average&Very Lucky,"Bon Jovi understood Arena Apeal real early in the game&were able to maintain that. this Box set has alot of reject Material that you can see why never made the Offical releases.they pretty much have been coasting after there ""New jersey"" album. over the top ballads&still trying to re-capture that Groove&Hook for ""Living on a Prayer"". truth is they are must remembered for doing the MTV Unlugged for ""wanted Dead or alive"".One of the Few Hair Bands that Escaped the 80's how&Why is still a Mystery??"
2,"100,000,000 Bon Jovi fans are wrong","Firstly where's that statistic title come from? Anyway whatever it's a great display of unsurprising self-indulgence from Bon Jovi. Okay, I'll be fair - there are a couple of half-decent tracks on here but most of this box set is made up of rubbish that to put it frankly didn't make the cut. Jon Bon Jovi is no Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen; they're two artists which have massive amounts of unreleased high quality material and can easily put out a release like this comprised almost wholly of excellent material. Bon Jovi however; yet again Jon has tried to emulate his idol Bruce Springsteen and failed miserably. Springsteen & the E St Band released a similar title a few years ago; the critically acclaimed Tracks which was made up of rare and unreleased songs. Bon Jovi however simply don't have the material to back this up hence this woeful release that can only be defined as substandard."
1,"100,000,000 Bon Jovi fans can't be wrong?","Yes they can, Bon Jovi, yes they can. When will amazon.com let us give zero stars for a review? With all of the great site upgrades they have done for us, they still deny us the zero stars option."
3,"Very good, with some flaws","I found this book to be a comprehensive history of spaceflight. The book is more historical and political in perspective than technical. More technical information and more illustrations would have helped. Coverage of the early twentieth century up until the sixties is wonderful, but the more recent chronology of the book progressively declines in authoritativeness and interest. Overall, I recommend the title for those who are interested in learning the complete history of spaceflight."
3,Good general summary but too broad to gain true insight,"Burrows tries to give the reader a general understanding of what went on in the ENTIRE space program. He should be commended for trying to cover all aspects (manned, planetary, US and Soviet) but because the subject matter is so vast, he is only able to cover stories at a top level. The detail is not as great as in Deep Black which was limited to a much smaller, specific subject. Nevertheless the book is of historical value for those who are interested in a broad brush, top level summary of the space program."
2,a partial view of the space age,"As a spanish, a found the book lacking an incredible amount of knowledge about the space program of Europe. I do not doubt the credentials of the author, but I can not understand his permanent confusion between the French and the European Space Agency (the equivalent to NASA) programs. It seems, from the text, that the well known Ariane program is a french bussiness, whereas it is actually the result of the collaboration (and the money) of more than ten countries.There is almost no discussion about the japanese and chinese space research. Little or no mention about the great scientific satellites from the United States, Europe and Japan that flew in the last 25 years. A lot of coverage for the Voyager missions, that seems to be paid by JPL. And no background of subjects very relevant to the modern world, as the communication satellites technology.In summary, a book just good to find trivial information, but not a good record of the ""first space age""."
2,disappointing,"More a political history than a technical one, and not very engaging. I agree, though, that the research is broad."
4,Good book on space politics,This was a very good book and worth keeping if you're a space nerd. The book covers the history and politics of mankind's use of space. The book is a little light on technical details. For example the author mentions Skylab but doesn't note the problems NASA had with that program. The book follows the people and politics and analysis pretty well.
5,get this album,This cd is great i recomend this cd because bizzy bone and krayzie bone goes off on this cd and any other ones so go get this cd its phat.
2,Not impressed...,"I am very disappointed in The PJs soundtrack. The PJs is an outstanding show and I purchased the soundtrack in hopes that it would be the same. The only true gems on the entire CD are ""Get Involved"" by Raphael Saadiq featuring Q-Tip and ""PJs"" by P-Funk icon George Clinton. If these two tracks were released as singles, I would not have purchased this CD."
2,Only Two Songs Worth Listening To,Get Involved (Raphael Saadiq/QTip) and What I Am (Sy Smith) and the only gems on this cd...the rest is throw away music
4,Very pleased with my purchase,I have been needing a solid case for some time and finding one for only $60 was nice since most cases like this start at $80.
2,Expensive Looking Case,"I ordered this case because of the low price tag, but was surprised when the invoice said that the case was nonreturnable.Especially, when I opened the case and discovered that the inside compartment, and lid were partially separated from the inside wall of the case.I assume the problem was improper installation at the factoryFortunately, I was able to fix the problem with some extra screws, glue, a small piece of wood, and a clamp.Unless you are fairly handy, or wish to roll the dice, hoping to get a good one, I would not recommend buying this guitar case."
4,Low price with competitive quailty,"This hardcase is not perfect in quality but considering the lowest price among hardshell cases, this can be one of good choice protecting a bass guitar never minding case damage."
4,Just what I needed,"With bass guitar case prices being what they are, I searched on Amazon to get a case that would protect my new bass after bringing it home from a local vendor. The vendor wanted about a hundred dollars for a bass guitar case, and I ended up taking it home ""naked,"" unwilling to pay that much. AM I GLAD!My advice on items like this is to shop around. You can pay a lot more for the same exact item somewhere else, and most chain stores sell at elevated prices (compared to online).The construction of this case is nothing out of the ordinary, but it does well for what I paid; I don't expect to get the same as something ten times its' price. For what I paid, this case is a bargain, and I would recommend it over the $100 one because it IS a much better value. The money left over got spent on other items on my Wish List. You can do the same. All my best!"
3,"If I ran a library I'd label this for ""young adults""","I got the trilogy as a gift, and I'm halfway through the second book. Not much depth to this - it reminds me of the Sword of Truth books by Goodkind. I imagine younger readers looking for a straightforward adventure yarn would get more out of it than I do. E.g. the fight-scenes are all very Errol Flynn with no screaming, blood or pain or anything else resembling realism."
2,Lack of adventure.,"Salvatore's best writing comes in his depiction of action. I am a fan of his attempts at psycho/sociological commentary in the guise of a fantasy, even though he beats you over the head with them more than he really delves. I like a good balance of intelligence and excitement.The Sword of Bedwyr did not make me want to run out and read the sequel. It makes me hope the sequel is better, but I'm in no hurry to find out. I just kept thinking it was slow and relatively uneventful. I tried to make excuses for it, thinking ""Maybe he wants to tell the story of a hero who isn't born superior to all around him (say Drizzt?), and wants to show how that character develops into someone more interesting.""Well, an origin story doesn't have to be action-packed to be intriguing, but if the intrigue doesn't pay out, then you're stuck with a dissapointed reader. My advice to R.A. on this one: A little more, little earlier."
2,This can't be a Salvatore book,"After immersing myself in several of Salvatore's tales (Icewind Dale trilogy, Dark Elf trilogy, etc.), I picked up this series. Unfortunately, it was nowhere near as interesting or compelling to read as his other titles. I agree with the earlier reviewer in that I could not for the life of me get into the story. I didn't even finish the last book, simply because I didn't really care what happened. Not at all what I expected to be, I can't really recommend this to anyone but the most devout Salvatore fan. Instead, read the Demon Wars Saga: much, much better."
5,the sword of bedwyr,"i think this book is exellent. it had extreme action, and a gripping plot. if I reccomend any book this I one I definitly would. I my self am about to start the second Luthrien's Gamble."
2,Oliver is a brilliant characterisation,"The main character fails but Oliver, the halfling character, is brilliant. It appears the fully fleshed Oliver was dropped into a lame story written around him. However, R.A. Salvatore remains by favourite author by combining spell casting & artifacts into all his books."
5,Another Salvatore classic...,This isn't Salvatore's best book but it is still full of all those elements that we love so much about Salvatores' books. In here he introduces you to a character that plays the classic role of an epic fantasy hero and his little swashbuckling sidekick as they go around defeating one-eyed brutes that seem to come to them all the time. The action is unrelentless and there is a lot of comedy in this book as well.
5,A SWASHBUCKLING EPIC ADVENTURE BEGINS!,"THIS IS A GREAT SWASHBUCKLING FANTASY ADVENTURE.A YOUNG MAN MUST OVERTHROW A EVIL WIZARD KINGAND HIS OGRE ARMY TO FREE HIS LAND. HE IS AIDEDBY A DARING HALFLING, A LOVELY WARRIOR WOMAN,AND EXOTIC HALF ELF BEAUTY.THIS SAGA HAS EVERYTHING: STIRRING BATTLES, HUMOR, MAGIC, ANDVILE VILLIANS."
3,Good,This is not any where close to his dark elf trilogy and ice wind dale trilogy. It is a good read if you find yourself with nothing much to do and want to read a book.And to all of the posters saying that this will be the last salvatore book that you read you should reconsider I did find the Lord of the Rings and Wheel of time better then this book but they are not as good as his dark elf and ice wind dale trilogy my favorite books.
2,Why a trilogy out of this book?,We're far away from Forgotten Realms with this book. Don't waste your money on this book. The hero is hallow and it's simply too easy.Meet Dritz instead.
3,"Mediocre, at a high school level.","To be honest I bought this book for the cover. I read the book in high school, when I hope most who read this book do.Honestly, Salvatore is not for developed minds. He writes towards a coming of age/ juvenile audience, and uses borrowed themes, races, and even plots to appease his readers. He garners no authentic mythology, but festers on clichéd artifacts such as crystals and swords.If you like clichéd smutty fantasy, you will love this book. If you like soaps perhaps a particular soap called ""Passions,"" you will love this book.If you are looking for diverse, authentic mythological high fantasy, you are bound to be disappointed with any of Salvatore's work.Extra note: The pretension of the pseudonymous pen-name disgruntled me as well."
2,Disappointing work by Salvatore this time,"After reading the Cleric Quintet, and the Dark Elf and Icewind Dale trilogies, I was excited to find this book. It was a disappointment though, and it seems weak compared to those other series.For some reason the story and characters just failed to interest me and it was more like reading a book written according to some recipe than a cohesive whole. All the usual Salvatore elements are there: protagonist, sidekick, villains and fantasy settings. But they didn't gel into anything believable or engaging so I can't recommend it. It was as if Salvatore tried to plug in these elements, expecting them to make an interesting story, but for me at least, it failed. Anytime I find myself hoping the protagonists are caught or killed, it's a bad sign.My opinion seems to be in the minority and the series may have improved after this first entry, but I'm not willing to buy the other books in that faint hope."
2,It is smaller than I expected,"My friend's copy is bigger than the one I received. Also, the picture is not as good as the big version. Think it is the reason why it is cheaper."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,ALL THIS STUFF CAN BE DONE BY GETTING YOUR FREE FORMS FROM THE IRS. I FILED THE INITIAL PETITION MYSELF AND GOT MARRIED ABOUT A MONTH AGO. I THEN DECIDED TO BUY THIS PACKAGE. WASTE OF MONEY. IT DID NOT TELL ME/ OR SHOW ME ANY THING THAT I DID NOT KNOW. I JUST BOUGHT IT AS A SAVEGUARD. IT IS INCOMPLETE AND SOME FORMS ARE OUTDATED. FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE TWO AFFIDAVIT OF SUPPORT FORMS THE SHORT VERSION(THAT YOU FILE INITIALLY) AND THE LONG VERSION(THAT YOU FILE AFTER YOU ARE MARRIED.
3,Bitterroot,"good story but the author would sometimes fracture it with frequent, unrelated descriptions of the area the story was taking place in..."
2,Steeveegee,"I'm a Burke fan but Bitteroot is overloaded with contradictions and implausible acts with no less than a dozen kidnappings to what end is not clear. Ole' Billy Bob Holland can't seem to hit his butt with a gun but we are constantly reminded of his being an ex-Texas Ranger. We are also reminded that Mr. Holland went to Viet Nam as an ROTC lieutenant. ""Rotsies"" got no respect and I'm glad we didn't have any that lasted in my unit.I've contacted Mr. Burke's staff to help clarify some minor inaccuracies with Dave Robicheaux being an ex-LRP. Not only was I a LRRP in the 82nd Airborne I also trained close to Burke's Louisiana setting and ironically have been all over Western Montana, an area that simply would not tolerate the charcters in ""Bitteroot"".I'm looking forward to Burke's next offering and also hope he cuts back on the ""Nam Angst"" he seems to invest in his characters."
4,Good read,"James Lee Burke is one of my favorite authors. His work is good and easy read. However, this book was not easy for me to relate to as I am not from the south, nor do I have experience with some of the lingua that was used. This did not detract me from the story which was excellent!"
3,Enough is enough,I always look forward to Burke's work. But it has finally grown wearisome. And more predictable and violent. Turn to any page of this novel and you can find some depravity. It is almost cartoonish. And where is the great writing that has characterized Burke's work in the past? This book is essentially a parody of his past work. He is a wonderful writer whose first Holland novel seemed to offer wonderful promise. It's a promise not fulfilled.
2,A Landscape Devoid of Purpose,"As a novelist myself (The Legacy, Savage Press Oct. 2000), I began reading James Burke's latest tome with an eye towards learning something about the Great American West and the interplay between the land and Burke's fictional charactors. While the desciptions of Montana soared and provided a stunning background to ""Bitterroot"", the lack of any meaningful plot and the use of cardboard people to populate the landscape was disappointing. I had never read any of Burke's stuff. I was anticipating a northern version of Tony Hillerman. I was sorely disappointed."
4,a full-flavored read!,"In BITTERROOT Burke takes us far away from Louisiana, the land of his birth, to the high country of Montana & continues the development of his new character of Billy Bob Holland.One thing Burke does well with his characters, is that they all have a past. I don't like characters cut from whole cloth, because when I read I want to lay my eyes upon the patched quilt that makes up a character's life, that way I truly feel like I know them.The social content deals with some very real probelms that are ongoing in today's society, & raises questions about just where one should place one's feet when straddling the fence. It also makes it very clear that fence straddling can be a dangerous occupation."
3,Beautiful paragraphs......ugly story,"James Lee Burke can write with a beauty seldom matched. Many of his past books are among my favorites. This one is filled with some incredibly beautiful paragraphs but the story is strangely lacking in feeling or believability. Terrible things happen one after another and everyone just seems to sit around, eat, fish and make love then wait for the next terrible thing to happen. Burke is a wonderful, warm human being in person and it generally shows through in his books even amid the horror that happens in his worlds. This book has no warmth, no tenderness no James Lee."
4,shove the leftist point of view,"Is it legal for an ex Texas ranger to buy a handgun from a dealer in Montanna? just curious..like the story and writing, don't care for the anti-business/rich vs poor slant.."
2,"Old formula, meet new setting.","The seediness and depravity of the New Orleans wards so beautifully depicted in the Robicheaux novels does not transplant to rural Montana well, nor without laying bare the formula that underlies most of Burke's books. A host of psychopaths, degenerates and Mafiosos mix with a stage full of psychologically damaged innocents and not so innocents including the trademark flawed ex-lawman and his violence prone pal. Burke's gift for flowery agreeable prose which in past outings has raised this genre fiction to the threshold of literature here fails to camouflage the obvious retrofit that is Dave Robicheaux of New Iberia reborn as Billy Bob Holland in Montana. Two thirds into the story and the work seems to have degenerated into an aimless daisy-chain of one violent confrontation linking to the next act of heartless cruelty, all involving characters who are difficult to care about."
3,A little flat,"A long-time Burke fan, I found this offering a little flat. The storyline is intact but the prose is substandard for Burke."
5,Read him once...and you're addicted,"James Lee Burke ... I'd read him anywhere, any time, any place, any whatever. The man can write with a force which is breath-taking. His books delve into the character of men in stressful circumstances...men working within a code of honor that is a throwback to other times. His characters live and speak with the pain of ghosts...convincingly. These men carry their pasts alongside their futures within the despair of realism. They face life's travails with a stoicism almost puritanical yet still find the joy in living. Once you've read ""In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead,"" you will be forever addicted to Mr. Burke and can only anticipate the next gem, and this is it."
4,Great games for all,"This game is great for someone trying to learn new casino games and perfecting the games you already know. Some days the slots pay out and some days they don't. When playing poker some days you get good cards and others you don't, just like the real deal. I'd purchase this again if i had the chance!"
3,"OK, not perfect","Program works fine but have to have disc inserted to play. Can't change opposing players features or chat - you play with the same 3 people all the time- who pretty much keep repeating the same chat lines. Other than that, there's plenty to do and see with decent tutorials for first time players."
2,You can't play it without inserting the CD,"This game was fun the first time I used it. But, you can't play it without putting the CD into the drive EACH time you want to use it. Too much bother. I bought it used, I'm going to sell it."
3,"""Promo"" for Among the Stars",Former Moody Blue Mike Pinder issued this 5-song EP back in 1993 as a sort of promo for what became his full length solo album Among the Stars a couple of years later. All 5 of these tracks are on Among the Stars.
5,lovely children's book,"This book is very well illustrated and the expressions on Habibi's face are priceless. Both my children can identify with habibi deciding she needs a hat as they're also very into the dress-up mode these days. Lovely book, would definitely recommend to all ages."
3,Good With Cream Cheese,"I was a little disappointed in these cracker flats -- they just didn't wow me. My roommate, however, has become addicted to them. I find they taste very good with cream cheese. With or without cream cheese, though, they seem to give me heartburn (not sure why). If you have never eaten these before, I would not recommend buying the pack of 6; see if you can find one box (in a health food store probably) and try them first."
3,Could be better,This replacement seal just doesn't fit right unlike the one I'd purchased a few years ago. This time around I think the seal is making the top more drafty because it doesn't fit properly and allow the top to come down far enough. The cutouts aren't big enough and it won't slide around the windshield frame so the top doesn't come down enough to get a good seal around the door frame. I paid a bit less this time around and apparently got an inferior product as a result.
2,Not effective,Used this filter cleaner as directed on my spa filter. One week later the spa display indicated that filter should be cleaned or replaced. Soaking the filter overnight is really the only effective way to clean the filter. No short cuts!!
5,Dora the Explorer 3,Great learning tools for my 3 year old. It's repetitive and straight to the point. Lots of day to day problem solving issues.
4,Good and entertaining,I found this to be entertaining and interesting for the kids. The stories are fantastic and my little boy enjoy it
5,Great,My son loved that I bought this. He is so happy he can watch this show anytime he wants. It's his favorite episode.
1,Dora,"I am sure under different circumstances I would give this a higher rating! As it is, my 5 year old granddaughter was playing a game on my Kindle Fire and somehow went to the move section and clicked on this and bought it without my knowledge! So....I paid over 12.00 for a movie that I really didn't want! Oh well! I learned an important lesson!"
2,Not what I'd hoped for,"I bought this so I could download it to my laptop so my daughter could watch Dora when wifi is not available. However, Amazon won't let me download it to my laptop, only to a kindle fire. So it was pointless to have purchased it. I can hook up to netflix if I have wifi. Should I have known better- probably, but I'm still not happy."
3,Mediocre results,"I ordered this prism for my 4 year old daughter. We took it outside and in full sunlight, it will create the rainbow effect, but not as easily as I would like. We had to hold the prism up above the ground and catch the light at just the right angle to get a refracted color pattern. I think a glass prism would probably work better, but then it would also be much more breakable. The instructions say to use a flashlight, but unless your flashlight produces full spectrum light (maybe an old model with an incandescent bulb), I don't think this will show any separated colors."
3,Too small,"This is a very slim prism! Each side of the triangle was only 3/4"" and it was 4"" tall. The height wasn't the problem. Trying to focus a flashlight beam through the 3/4"" side was very hard. I was able to get a rainbow, but it was not very well defined."
2,"Does work, just not well.","The prism does work, but it take a bright light and a very dark room. It doesn't give off a vibrant color spectrum and isn't something that will keep the attention of young kids. Overall, I expected more; but I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Does not work!,This prism does not work. I advice you to look for a different prism and not waste your money on this one!
2,"Alfalfa, all grow'd up and singin' Jazz","Where do you start with this album? If you enjoy the sweet tones of Alfalfa from the Lil' Rascals, then this is the perfect album for you. The plain, mundane, off key tones of BoB [Spelled Backwards] are no match for the brilliance of the real players on this album. Overlooking the vocals, ""Bravo"" is the word I would use for the beatnik musicians who put real jam to jazz. Is there an instrumental version of this album?"
4,Get Up and Swing to the Grateful Dead!,"Swingin' to the Grateful Dead (1999) is about as upbeat as you can get. The album is a brassy instrumental tribute to the best tunes the Grateful Dead ever recorded. The songs range from big band swing to dixieland. As you listen to this recording, you'll be truckin' and swingin' and you'll be amazed at how powerfully the Dead's stuff transcribes to the world of jazz big band."
1,dead fans,"If you are a true dead fan you will more than likly hate this cd. I'm sure jerry's turning in his grave, It's an insult to the dead and all the dead members. In short this album should have never been released!"
5,A Total Blast! Love it!,"Swingers and classic rockers take note...this is great! This cd will make everyone start tapping their toes and dancing to the music. Marsh cooks on sax (et al), the horns are awesome and the production is fab! Great to hear the real instruments, (not a lot of programmed tracks) the real deal! Great Fun! I put it on at the office and people were coming in asking where to get it before the first track was over. You might have to lock up your copy to keep it in your possession!"
4,If you're a TRUE music fan...,"then you'll know WHY this album was made. I, unlike the rest of my generation, am really into jazz, especially swing. If you are a true music fan, not only do you at least appreciate the grateful dead, but you can trace them back to the jazz era. THis album goes through many styles, which is nice, too. The Grateful Dead can be traced back to folk (obviously), which can be traced to jazz and blues. I really like this album and was really excited to find it. I do recommend it."
5,"A warm, moving collection of stories",A House of Butter is a great collection of stories. There is a straightforward honesty and openness to the writing which I really enjoyed. Several selections are quite touching. Buy it.
3,"""Cutesy"" little read.","This is a small book that basically gives 100 recommendations to obtain or maintain health. Most of the advice (even though there's nothing in the way of in-depth) is sound although it's pretty much just common sense. In other words if you are moderately health-conscious I don't think you are in for any great discoveries. One of the more ridiculous suggestions in the book was that you could get the daily amount of water you need simply by the foods you eat and that you shouldn't drink a lot of water. Anyone who is anyone in the fitness or nutrition industry will tell you how important and absolutely vital it is to drink water owing to the facts that it keeps you hydrated, cleans your system, and is the best natural diuretic we have. At times this book comes off dry and monotonous but it's one of those books that's interesting enough and ""feel good"" enough to keep you reading long enough to get through it without too much distaste."
1,CRACKED after a handful of uses,"I've had this set for just about 1 year and only used it a handful of times. Tonight while roasting a pork loin on 450 degrees, I heard a large ""bang"" come from my oven. When I opened the door, I found that the dish had just cracked and split all the way down the side. Very disappointed! I thought for the price, this stoneware should last perhaps more than 5 trips in the oven. I am not rough on things and all my Pyrex and CorningWare has far outlived this costly, over-hyped piece of junk."
3,They will break eventually,"These are great for cleanup and they bake OK, but they will break after a couple of years of use. I'm not sure if it is because of continued heating and cooling, but mine have broken ""in the oven"" while baking. 350 degrees after about 15 minutes for the last one. Good while they last, which is limited."
5,Perfect size,"These bakers are perfect for when you want to cook smaller portions. Sometimes I hate to use my oven for small dishes, so I pop these in my toaster oven and they fit perfectly. Food has always cooked perfectly in them and I love the fact that they are microwave and dishwasher safe as well!"
3,Made in Thailand??,"The sizes are ideal for a light dinner for two plus a dessert (I added a few pics so people can get a better idea of the size of these bakers). My only disappointment was that I was under the impression all Le Crueset items are created in France. Even though the box informed me that it was created according to specifications ordered by Le Crueset, I guess the only way to really know is to compare them with the other cookware I own. The bakeware is beautifully finished, almost flawless from what I can see so far as I took them right out of the box. I shall post here again somewhere down the line if they worked out or not."
1,Beware,Both pieces are extremely small. You should not expect to have a practical purpose for them. They look great but are not useful.
1,Happy until item cracked in half in oven,I wonder has anyone else had this problem. I purchased about a year ago & was excited that this could be used in a hotter oven. I was using the other day in a 425 degree oven when I heard a noise & was shocked to see that it has split about halfway & all the way through. I now had two approximately equal pieces. Would really like to hear if this is just a freak occurence.
1,"Nice pan, but not protected in package.","Gave this item as a gift. When opened it had a chip. The chip was in the package so I know it happened while shippping. It was after the return date, so I left packing feed back and a picture for Amazon to see. They did not reply. I think the item would have been great, but the experience was a 1 star,"
2,"too small, look at measurements carefully",Quite disappointed with how small the product actually is compared to how gorgeous it looks in the picture. Should have been careful about the measurements. Many people can easily make the mistake and buy it and like me not bother to return it although not happy with the product either. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT.
3,Mostly Classic Jazz,"Mostly straight ahead jazz with solos from vibraphone and sax etc..on every song which gets a little old but every instrument sounds good and with some top name backups. Mostly jazz standards with a few originals. Jon does a good job on jazz vibes with a Milt jackson approach that sounds not quite as soulful. Nothing to get too excited about, just straight ahead jazz."
3,Would have enjoyed more Sylvia and less Antoinette.,"This book requires great leaps of faith. If I'm going to leap it should be with the real psychic, not someone watching from the outside. The story is told with great respect for it's heroine and not a great deal of detail. Would have preferred Sylvia in her own words."
1,Please Consider!,This is an incredibly awful book. I clung to every word she said and honestly felt enlightened. That was before I did some more research on the book. Now I feel sick to my stomach and can't believe that I ever liked this book.
