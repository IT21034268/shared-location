1,"Player problem? Maybe, but disc problem, too!","The problem is clearly related to certain DVD players having trouble reading some information on the DVDs. You can point your finger at the DVD player, but the real question is why did Disney release a disc that clearly is troublesome for so many players. Two different copies did not work on the four DVD players I tried (including the one on my computer, so even that is not a universal solution). Disney needs to fix this problem and provide free exchange somehow. MGM had a similar problem with a James Bond disc (Man with a Golden Gun) which only surfaced on some players - they provided for free exchage through the mail. Disappointing that Disney is not doing the same..."
1,Do you have time/money to waste?,Three separate copies of the DVD version did not work in my player but did work in my PC DVD-rom drive. How disappointing for my five year old who has been looking forward to receiving the movie since we saw it in the theatre. A letter to the Disney store pointed me to Buena Vista technical service but didn't say anything about a known problem with MOST DVD players. Beware consumers! Unless you have time and/or money to waste you may want to think twice about purchasing this one in DVD.
4,GOOD MOVIE,Although I thought the fiirst 15 minutes of the movie were the best and it was not one of Disney's best. I Still liked it alot very educational for kids getting an idea of what happened to the dinosaurs.
1,G. L. Strytler's book would make a better flick!,Length:: 1:52 MinsWho would win? Dragos or Dinos?Adventures With Boys BOOK 5: Dragons Versus Dinosaurs (Adventures With the Boys)
2,Parents Be Warned,"Hello, I know this is a childrens movie but did Disney remember that? The violence in this movie was unacceptable. Working at a local theatre I saw first hand the number of disappointed parents faces and horrified childrens faces. Disney thought of there money book before they thought of the children on this one. Two thumbs down to them. I love almost all Disney movies but they severly disappointed me with this one. Not only was their to much violence this story has been done before, or does nobody remember ""The Land Before Time"". Littlefoot and his friends were much more lovable than Aladar and his hormones! Now all bashing aside the movie does work and has some very good moments, including fantastic computer animation. However if you have younger children 8 & under I strongly suggest looking before you leap."
2,dinosaur,"land before time was better. this does have great special effects though.I just get sick of the misplaced or orphand animal,like in 9 out of 10 disney films."
2,Fair movie and bad quality Blu Ray,"I was VERY disappointed with the quality of this Blu Ray. I was hoping to be amazed by the quality, which would have enhanced my viewing pleasure and raised my thoughts of this movie, but this wasn't the case. As some have said, this does look like a DVD transfer and not a direct transfer from the original digital source like some other discs out there. I hope Disney will rectify this problem as Sony Pictures has done with Fifth Element for it's customers and fans. I expected a better product from such a major studio. Bad Disney, bad..."
3,good movie,my kids watched this movie until it died. The movie had some great graphics and was a fun film for the family.
5,NICE FAMILY MOVIE,My granddaugther & I used to watch this movie over & over... it kepted her (& myself) laughing.. very lovely family movie...
3,Decent enough quality for bluray.,"For now, this is the best quality this movie is ever going to look in HD. The video still doesn't come close to the quality of other CG-animated fare on bluray like Cars, Kung Fu Panda, The Incredibles, etc. There is an abundance of compression artifacts in the image which are clearly visible on screens larger than 60 inches; and the blacks/shadows fall off into dark grays. Perhaps Disney should go back and remaster this movie using a better compression codec like AVC instead of MPEG2 which was used for this bluray and encode the audio with a lossless HD codec like DTSHD-MA. CG-animated movies deserve to be mastered in the best video and audio codecs for HD bluray---Disney get with the program why dontcha?"
3,Let's Make a Buck!,"I'm not reviewing the film here, just the Blu-ray release. With all the touting about how great Blu-ray discs are and all the special features available, Disney gives us SQUAT on this release. I had wanted to replace my 2-disc DVD version with this, but noooo! Almost all of the special features on the DVD were NOT ported over to Blu-ray. Disney also did this with Fantasia and Fantasia 2000, leaving off the making-of documentaries found on the DVD releases and the additional short films. Seems the beancounters have a total disregard for the fans and collectors of these movies!"
1,No.,"This is a more realistic version of ""The Land before Time"". Plot? ""This place is destroyed we have to move as a huge mixed herd to another one except this time we'll do it looking like real dinosaurs instead of cute singing ones with eyelashes.""don't waste your money."
3,"Animation excellence, but not for young viewers","Animation scenes at times border on Imax quality, but the topic-dinosaurs is not for the young or nightmare-prone viewer. Despite having cuddly monkeys to help offset the large often scary dinosaurs, the gruesome fight scenes are too much for those with young kids. The movie does come round full circle like ""The Lion King"", but the visuals make this much more scary as all is more realistic."
1,Very Scary for Tots,"A very nice looking movie, the special effects made the dinosaurs look that much more realistic. The story itself was pretty bland...somewhere down amonst the lesser Disney films like ""The Fox and the Hound"" But the violence in the movie really detracted from the movie.I bought this movie for my 4 year old son. The first Dinosaur attack had him screaming and in tears. I shut the movie off after the big dinosaur looked like he was going to start snapping the heads off the little ""monkeys"", and watched the rest after he was in bed.You may want to consider potential nightmares for youngsters (which my son has had for a few nights). Too bad Disney didn't opt to make a more family-oriented movie like ""Song of the South"" or ""Bambi""."
2,This film deserve a grade of D -- for Dinosaur.,"A dreadful bore, ""Dinosaur"" doesn't have a single original moment in it. Everything is something we've seen somewhere before. The politically correct story chugs along to a predictable ending, without one moment of novelty or surprise. Children who haven't seen many movies might enjoy it, but adults will wish they'd found a better way to spend their time."
4,EllieandBoo,"It's been awhile since I've read this book, but I really enjoyed it. Dr Kaiser's book takes you inside Amish homes where she delivers their babies. What really struck me was the fact that many Amish women keep working...canning food...sewing...cooking... right up until the time they are ready to lay down and push the baby out! Dr Kaiser fights her way through snow storms, battles attacking farm dogs and deals with some quirky Amish people which makes for some very entertaining reading!"
3,Should have gotten pink?,"I purchased this in wisteria. The first thing I realized was that it was like a mystery to get it one. Aside from the halter top, there are strings in the back criss-crossing among other things and I felt like I was caught in a spider-web trying to get it on. Once, I got it on, I basically looked like I was wearing a bathing suit, not sleepwear and definitely not any type of sexy lingerie. Bonus: I had realized, it also came with a thong. This should be relabled as ""very complicated, very not sexy"" lingerie, not sleepwear. The material is otherwise and pleasant. The look is nowhere near as flattering as it is on the model so unless you look like her...don't."
3,Good book to learn the basics,Book great for the entry thinking person to learn the basics of how car washes work. Defenitly a great starting point. Dives a bit deaper than just basics and sets you up for understanding the biz.
2,not great,"The estimate for an automatic wash was not accurate. I checked with a national company and the price was double what the book listed, also the book had typos (very unprofessional)."
4,Book: Planning for Biodiversity by Sheila Peck,"The book starts off pretty technical, but it is textbook being used in an Ecological Restoration class. It does have some good useful information and the Case Studies at the end of each chapter help pull all of the Chapter info together."
3,Air Battles during the Korean War.,"First, I commend the author for writing a book about a little explored topic. Many books tell of the land warfare in Korea, but few detail the air battles involving Mig 15s and Sabrejets F-86s. This book attempts to do this, and I think suceeds in showing the violence of the air war. The author breaks his book into chapters detailing the exploits of individuals waging this battle. Unfornatunately, it tries to cover too much in a very short book. One gets a good sense of the first year of the air battles, but nothing of the last two years.This is a good, though average read. The material covered is unique. I just think the author tried to be too broad in his historical approach and personal stories, and didn't do either very well. An average read about a little written part of the Korean War."
5,no more grody sponges,"I love this, because it lets my sponge dry from all angles, and the coated wire won't scratch my sink."
5,What I was looking for...,I purchased this basket along with the mesh sink basket in an attempt to clear clutter on my sink rim. This tray holds my sink drain and disposal cover along with my sponge and scrubber. Perfect for what I was needing. Sponges now drip into the sink instead of sitting on the rim and my drain covers have a place to be other than the sink rim. My sink area now looks much neater.
2,"Handy, but has 2 big problems","At first, this caddy appeared to solve the problem of utencils loose in the sink and sometimes falling into the garbage disposal. But I soon found there are a couple fatal flaws and I won't purchase it again. First of all, the openings in the basket are so large that the tines of the forks would stick through them and get lodged in there. It needs to be a finer mesh, but not so fine that particles gather in the bottom. Secondly, like other reviewers, I was dismayed to see the rust forming in the white coating. It is unsightly, so in the garbage it goes. I'm going to look for a stainless one that has smaller holes in it. I cannot recommend this coated wire sink basket."
4,This is my second one.,"I wish the hang over part was smaller so it could hang over a wire rack. Otherwise, it is great."
4,wire basket,"Nice basket, good quality. Bought it as a silverware basket (my dish strainer is to small to lose a ton of space for silverware). It could be a little skinier (takes up a lot of space in the sink) but it depends on your needs."
1,4 weeks old and rusty,Can you imagine my disappointment? So do I toss this or let the rust drip down and stain my sink?
3,"Not too good for play, but nice as a souvenier.","The cards arent are not jet black in color, they are a pale black so to speak. Also, the artwork is such that telling the difference between the suits is a bit of a problem."
3,Novelty item,"I bought these because of the design. I don't play bridge, but thought I would try them out. I like the design, but they really seem thin. I'm not talking about the width... I know bridge cards are smaller than Poker cards. I'm referring to the weight of the card (thickness). They seem very flimsy compared to other Copag's. Other than that, they are fine."
3,Good as a novelty item...,"...but not so good for actual use. It's hard to tell the value of the card if you can't read the numbers in the upper left/lower right corners of the card. With standard cards you can count the number of hearts/spades/diamonds/clubs in the center of the card even if you can't read the number in the corners of the card clearly. With these cards the non-face cards all look like aces if you can't see the value of the card in the corners. For example, 2-10 of clubs all have a big white club in the center with little black clubs on the large, white center club. The ace of clubs has the same white club in the center of the card with one small black club on the white club. It's hard to see the little black clubs so from a distance, or if you have bad eyesight, they all look like the ace of clubs.They look cool and I like Copags, but I don't recommend this particular set for any serious play."
3,Dark Cards,"These cards have some great flair, however, I found them hard to read and tell between suits. I've since gone back to regular white backed cards."
5,SAW THEM IN CONCERT,"I saw JCS live at the EDGE b-day bash and they kicked ass they played the one chord song but my favorite was high because Jimi HAHA is a freakin idot jumpin around saying,,,, HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
5,You must try this album,"If you like Rock, this could possibly be the best album you will ever buy. Now,I NEVER give bands a 5 out of 5 howver, I thought that this cd deserves ever praise that it can get. If you are any sort of fan of the 90's genre of rock, you will like this album. There is no doubt about it. The fact that this album was overlooked for so many years give you an opertunity to discover a treasure that so amny people have looked over. If you like rock, take a risk and buy this album. It will be worth it!"
4,Thanks..,thanks for good service just got this past week with in a few days..thanks again come back if you have what I looking for...
4,Better Than BYOS,"This album is really enjoyable. It's far better than ""Bring Your Own Stereo"". There's more rock here and better hooks. I like the guitar style and Jimmy HA HA is a good vocalist. My personal favorites are ""Outhouse"" & ""Spiderweb"". The only song I skip is ""Schoolbus"", but its a comical song. Overall this album is really good and will stay in my cd player for a while."
2,"Misleading title, some other issues, Budge's survey is more interesting","First, this has very, very little to do with witchcraft or magic in Europe. The first part is about Mesopotamian magical texts, while the second one involves questions of divination and curses in the Old Testament.This book is also quite simplistic and does not provide a very deep look at any of these subjects.I would recommend ""Amulets and Superstitions"" by Budge as a better coverage of the same material despite the fact that it is a century out of date."
1,Definitely Not Restored,"I am only going to review the print quality; you can read the other review for other useful information. In this case, just as Warner states, this is an unrestored print and it shows. The picture is fuzzy, the sound is awful. It may be partly the way it was originally recorded, but at times the background music annoyingly overwhelms the dialogue. Having an unrestored print with scratchy sound does not help. Worse still, the sound is about 1/2 second or more late to the picture, and out-of-sync sound-to-image is my pet peeve; it pretty much spoils a film for me. I made it all the way through the film, which I actually thought was a pretty interesting movie, particularly the Wheeler and Woolsey stuff, but I can't watch it again. One last thing: during much of the great tap dance scene, Wheeler's legs are cut off, out of the bottom of the frame. Either the director was a moron or this is horrendous print."
2,Key Song Missing,"Was anxious to get this old musical as I had heard a lot about it - it has great historical movie value. I received it a year ago, and the print was alright, but missing was ""The Kinkajou"", a supposedly hilarious dance number. I had only heard the song on a CD and looked forward to seeing it. I couldn't, because it is not on this Warner Archive DVD. I felt cheated but didn't want to send it back - I had already sent one back which wouldn't play. Buyer Beware!"
1,Stop Stalling Already,"Now I have been an avid fan of these books. I am one of the fans that would wait at the bookstore the day it came out and read the whole book before the sun went down. OVer the past 2 books, however, the stalling has become utterly ridiculous. I used to defend the authors when people would down the books because they believed that the authors main motivation was money. Now I believe them! The series was supposed to be 7 books long and that was apparent in the intial 4 books, but as popularity grows they get slower and slower. No one cares about these no name characters. It's like you wait 6 months for the book to come out because he waits till page 400 (out of 450) to get a plot and a climax going and then he leaves you hanging. Mr. LaHaye you have an obligation to you fans (the ones who keep you on the best sellers list) to write quality novels, not books with a start, garbage in the middle, and a cliff hanger in the end."
2,Why a new reader?,"In the first 7 books, there was the same reader, now, with the mark, there is a new reader, which is always a pain in the butt. This new author also tried to imitate the accents of each person. Not fun to listen to. Add to this my opinion these books are nothing but poorly constructed religious porn."
2,Not a remarkable read,"This book based on the end times in Revelation disappointed me. Written on the level of a fifth grader as one reviewer observed, it has cardboard characters and lacks the qualities of good fiction."
5,loved it,"hubby bought it, loves the series -- looking forward to more.. received it very quickly -- and it's in great shape"
3,...Excellent Character and Plot Growth Continues Yet Again,"Again, Book 8 builds on the extremely successful writing changes in Book 6 and 7. Book 8 continues to make the point for good plot growth and some new characters are added to the mix to provide an excellent change of pace."
4,Slow but still enjoyable,I have been waiting on this book for months and as usual I was not disappointed. The difference with this book is that the action is much more intense and gory. The feeling that I got was that this book was getting you ready for the next one. I read this book in a day and 1/2.
2,We Don't Get It?,"The reader from ""suburban Detroit"" implied that anyone who criticizes this series is not a Christian. I have been a believer for over 40 years, believe in the pre-trib Rapture and the Millennium, and to me, this series STINKS! The characters are unbelievable, the plot is unbelievable, and you would have to be able to swallow a camel to accept everything they are feeding you. The number of books in the series is also unbelievable. Forget this pablum and read your Bible instead."
1,Waste of Money,I own and have read all eight books in The Left Behind Series. The Mark was truely the biggest waste of time and money I think I have ever made. All Filler.
3,Stretching the Series,"All of the previous books held your attention and the action moved. This one re-hashed the previous stories too much and had little action. The last book (I hope) will wrap everything up, or do they intend to keep on and on? This will be the last one I read."
4,I liked this one!,"I started to read Left Behind several months ago, and unlike most reviewers, I didn't like it. I kept picking it up and putting it down nut it just didn't appeal to me.I picked up The Mark and I was pleasantly surprised. It's much better than I had hoped. It is interesting. It is a quick paced book. It has elements of a good spy novel, and it kept me turning the pages. I read the book in two days. (My family shared in the reading as it was easy to read aloud.)I approached reading The Mark as a ""last ditch"" attempt to get into the Left Behind series. I must admit, I think I might go back and read some of the other books. If they are as good as The Mark I will be pleased.The Mark is highly enjoyable reading."
2,Good writing?? Come on!,"After reading many of the reviews I don't understand how anyone could possibly think this series represents good writing! It is so poorly written that I almost gag on some of the dialog. The first half of the first book was the best, got me hooked on the story, but it went downhill after that. The only thing that has kept me going is that I do find the story fascinating....and I'm also the kind of person that will sit through a really bad movie just because I have to find out what happens at the end! It's so disappointing because this series, with good writing and better characters, could have been really good."
3,Starting to get bored with the series,"Lahaye and Jenkins have somewhat redeemed themselves from their last book (The Indwelling), which was a total disappointment. The Mark flows the same as the past 3 or so. I believe the original concept was for 7 books and they have extended it to 12(?), however it is beginning to amaze me that can stretch one event over 300+ pages. The writing is getting pretty thin, with a lot of unnecessary ""filler""...not much substance. I would recommend borrowing the book from someone or buying it second hand. Mine's for sale!"
3,I liked it!,"Yes, it was an easy read. I have read the whole series and never spent more than a few hours reading it. Still, the plot made it irresistable. That being said, the ""Left Behind"" promoters have left no stone unturned and parlayed this into an industry unto itself, like ""40 Days of Purpose"" or TBN - buy the audio tapes, buy the tee shirts, join the club - and, hey, don't forget to buy a nice Christian coffee mug and bumper sticker while you're at it! My husband calls all the little extras ""Christian crap""-- and I tend to agree.If you want a good, fast-paced, easy-to-read story, with some theology thrown in to boot, read the book, enjoy it, and bypass the cofee mugs and tee shirts! If you just HAVE to spend money, send a donation to the Gideons so they can put a Bible in someone's hands, or send it to Operation Christmas Child or some other worthy cause :)"
4,A very entertaining read,"Emphasis on ""entertaining"". Scriptural content is kind of light here, but the story is gripping. Nicolae's personality is almost cartoony at this point (why is his middle name ""Jetty""? Where did THAT come from?), but there's a lot more characterization and detail than the last one. As for the Chang controversy, since he didn't technically ""take"" the mark, perhaps it doesn't count? Unfortunately the Bible doesn't have anything to say about that. Altogether, though, it's an enjoyable book."
1,"Oh, Come On... How Much More Nonsense Can We Take?","If another one of these books invades the market, we all might as well go into our closets and pray! I'm surprised that the authors haven't yet come up with a legitimate Bible verse that defends their personal influence they are now employing on our would be ""end-times"" society... But, then again, how gullible of a society are we? It's really sad to think that the Christian community regards this... as ""truth"" disguised as fiction. I seriously would start praying for our Christian authors and our Christian publishing houses. The authors and publishers, who are probably millionaires by now, are certainly laughing all the way to the bank! Amen Brother!!!"
2,Did not hit The Mark,"I have read all the Left Behind series and anxiously await as each becomes available. Was very dissappointed with the latest ""The Mark"". I felt as if I was being preached to or reading a sermon throughout the whole book. There was really no story to the latest in the series, and felt it was just an effort to drag the series out."
1,"This is for CHRIS , the pastor","THANK YOU..THANK YOU...just for agreeing that these books, while I have no doubt are well intentioned, are blatently poorly written, lack depth..black and white, Saturday cartoonish in their problem solving---I have read ""Christ Clone Trilogy""..they were good...enjoyed very much....I've read all the Left Behind..I""m a Christian..and I wish the writers would step up to the plate and write....I cannot recommend these...and I'll try ""We all fall Down""..."
5,Great Book,"The Mark, along with the rest of the series, is the most awesome book I have read. I would recommend this for anyone, whether you are a new believer, been a believer for years or if you're still not sure. This book, along with the rest of the series will bring you to Christ. This book, along with the rest of the series is the number one book I would recommend."
2,I don't get it!,"I have done my best to stick with this series, but so help me, I am giving up. I've read enough end time thrillers to offer SOME semblance of appreciation for the genre, but it escapes me how this droning rehash qualifies any more. I quit. And I quit on this note: for all the Apocalyptic novels I've read, there is NONE that delivers the power and the punch of Glen Klier's THE LAST DAY. Anyone who raves about these LEFT BEHIND ""sermons"" owes it to themselves to read a QUALITY work of Judgment Day fiction with well crafted characters, plot and suspense. THE LAST DAY presents all of this and more, including a ""spirituality check"" that is both provocative and mind opening. Neither THE MARK nor any of its predecessors comes close to THE LAST DAY in challenging the reader's mind or soul."
2,"Might be Interesting, but not Biblical","Matthew 24:34 ""Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled."" This was said back in the first century in regards to the devastation talked about in the Left Behind series. Yes, all this hullaballoo about something that happened in 70 AD. We, as Christians, need to become better scholars of the Bible. We are a horrible witness to the rest of the world. May God have mercy upon us and bring forth the true teachings of the Bible regarding Eschatology."
4,Believers resist the Mark,"In the latest installment of the Left Behind series, Carpathian has come back to life and is insisting that all people receive his mark. The believers resist and there are several martyrs among them who lose their lives to the guillotines which Carpathian imports for just that purpose. There is one significant convert in this book and the action seems a bit crisper and clearer than in the previous two books. This book is clearly a transition to the time when the Tribulation Force will be dispersed to gather new believers to thwart Carpathian's plans before they disappear so they are not forced to accept the Mark of Satan. Hopefully, the remaining 3 years of the Tribulation will not require 8 more books!"
4,The Mark,This book is part of the Left Behind series and I have absolutely enjoyed reading this. I recommend the book and this series to anyone.
3,pokey delivery,"The book arrived by the delivery date stated which took nearly 3 weeks. I ordered other books in this series from other sellers and they all arrived within the first 2 weeks. The book arrived in good condition and the seller met the designated delivery date, but I felt it could have been shipped much quicker."
3,words,"""Noodling"" is annoying. ""Niggling"" is annoying.these are their favorite words.someone please make them stop."
1,TWO MANY WORDS NOT ENOUGH SAID,"I THOUGH THE BOOK DRAGGED ON AND ON WITH OUT GETTING INTO THE STORY NOT AT ALL THE QUALITY OF PREVIOUS BOOKS. ARE THEY JUST SELLING BOOKS OR TRYING TO GET A MESSAGE ACROSS? I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE STAYING CLOSE TO SCRIPTURES IF YOU ARE A PRE TRIB BELIEVER, BUT NOW THERE ARE TWO MANY THINGS THEY ARE TAKING LIBERTY WITH. CAN'T FIND WHERE YOU CAN SERVE TWO MASTERS."
4,Nice Story but Disturbing Audiotape,"From the Unabridged audio versionOne of the better entries in this series.Frank Muller is a fine reader and I usually have no problems with his work. But his interpretation of Nicholi in The Mark is way off. The previous reader (Frank Perone?) gave Nicholi a soft and becoming voice. A voice that was truly beguiling. Muller on the other hand give Nicholi the voice of a count Dracula. yes I kid you not, Count Dracula. And because Nicholi sounds so evil, he become less compeling, less believeable and it makes the tape seem too cartoony.As far as the believer getting the mark. I think as far as this story is concerned I think it may be possbile considering the circumstances that were laid out in this book. However, I don't think any rational reader is going to come away from this book with the conclusion that you can have both. The most likely conclusion, at least mine was, I wonder if a quick beheading is going to hurt."
1,Pure marketing...,"I absolutely agree with one of the previous reviewer of this book (cdlana from Bishop, CA USA). Although first book in this series was rather slow, next two or three books really kept me up almost all nights reading them. Unfortunately, it took me seven books to realize that this whole series is becoming more and more a clever marketing plot. And it's not just because the authors always leave everything unresolved in the end, forcing readers to look for a next book, but this last one really got me. C'mon guys, in all those previous books you were talking about how important it is to make a choice between accepting or rejecting ""mark of the beast"". Bible clearly says there could be no half-way through this, or so you said. Now, here we go. You're actually contradict it in this book #8. All this just to make sure you keep the plot hot and your readers willing to buy another book of yours. Let me tell you, you have just lost one of your readers."
3,Seemed like filler to me.,"Though I have enjoyed the series so far, this book seemed like filler, just something to put out there. Maybe the next book will be more exciting."
3,Clearly Inferior to the Rest,"I have read all of the books in this series and I feel that this one does little for the series. Not with the wonder, politics, and action that made the first one a (legitimate) success, this new one is a cash cow and that is apparent to everyone. I thought this would be a 7-book series, but because of its success, who knows how long this can go on? The authors can continue to put mediocre books on the shelves and they will be blockbusters regardless of their quality. This book aparently contradicts itself when the young Asian boy recieves the mark of the beast, but still can be saved. There are some good parts to this book, like the escape from the gas station and the plot to get the believers out of Dodge, but all in all it is an average book. And I expect better from such a blockbuster sucess."
2,Little activity in this book,"Overall, I've enjoyed the Left Behind series.The latest volume, The Mark, falls short. Very little happens here. It can be summed up as: More people are brought to Trib Force HQ. Some believers die. The Beast starts requiring the mark. Three sentences expanded into 400 pages.I'm a Christian. I like the series. But I can't abide seeing the Christian authors milking the Christian public (and others) for all they can. This is the sort of thing that puts Christianity in a bad light."
2,"Same Old, Same Old...","While I am a staunch pre-trib, pre-mil holder, I just found that after a while these books all began to run together. I thought that they were very well written but I just couldn't get into them after Appollyon. I would suggest that teenagers read these ones instead of adults."
1,GREEDY GREEDY GREEDY,Whether or not you agree with the theology presented in this series you have to admit it is a fantastic premise. However the writing is truly horrendous. I could ignore that but what I cannot ignore is the apparent greed of the authors who are in cahoots with their publishers. Originally this series was supposed be seven books long but when it became a huge hit the publishers asked the writers to expand the series so they could sell even more books and make bigger profits. Personally I don't care how many books they write as long as they tell a good story and keep me entertained. Unfortunately this seems impossible to do. While this book is not as bad as Assassins it isn't much better. It's all filler. Very little happens. Just alot of lecturing. If you took out all the padding the book would be about 50 pages long. Don't waste your money. If you really want to read this book take it out of the library. Learn from my mistake
1,Alot of Rehash...,"My biggest complaint with this and the last 5 books is the repeating of the previous story to catch you up to speed in the present book. If you are reading the 8th novel you in most cases don't need 5 chapters of refreshing your memory of the past 5 books. It seems the authors took a great idea and somewhere in the middle decided to get a little greedy and try to stretch the series out to sell more books. The first 3 years of the tribulation and the rapture were over in less than 3 or 4 books but will the end of the world come, I won't pay 18 bucks a book for the next 20 books to find out."
4,I am looking forward to the next book !!,"I have really enjoyed the first books in the left behind series, so I came into this book expecting a lot. I was very excited about the headquarters location change, but was a little disappointed that the entry into the building was not explained clearly. Book eight is not as exciting as the last book, but it will still keep you on the edge of you seat most of the time. Like the rest of the books, the ending is abrupt, and leaves you hanging. I look forward the next book, and hope that it will be a little more exciting."
2,Stuck in a time warp,"This book,all 400 hundred pages,was by far the worst written of the series. The authors are dragging out the series with long detailed, boring ""fillers"". They know they have us hooked and are trying to gain profit, instead of the true meaning of what the series is supposed to be about. I enjoyed the other 7, but this one was awful. Of course we have to wait another 8 months for the 9th book, and of course I will read it, I am hooked. Also don't buy the video ""Left Behind"". Although the 1st book was great, the video was just as bad as ""The Mark"""
2,Bored with this interminable story!,"I've had it! I stuck with this stuff out of loyalty, but you can count me teminably frustrated. The story doesn't go anywhere! Same old rehash, fiddle-faddling around, dragging the reader into yet another book like a Saturday afternoon matinee--""continued next week."" I've been taking to heart some of the other recommendations for alternative EndTimes stories made here, and of the three other books I've read, Kleier's THE LAST DAY is unquestionably the best. It seems to me that if you're going to write an Apocalyptic thriller, you should at least get your money's worth of thrills, not to mention a measure of suspense and provocative spiritual thought!"
1,The Mark,This movie was dumb not well done at all. I feel that this movie could of been done better and with a better story line.
2,"fillers, all of 'em","Seriously, since book 3, all of them have been an 80% retelling of the previous installments and 20% new stuff.If i wanted to read the previous book, why bother buying this one? I've had it, I'm throwing the towel.The Christ Clone Trilogy managed to pack all its content into 3 small books. And seems like left behind isn't offering anything that christ clone trilogy did not. At this rate, it wouldn't surprise me if the series was 'left behind' by more readers before it reached its conclusion."
5,Left Behind,"I,ve read all 8 books and Im waiting for the next one they are taking too long. I've never read so many books so fast, didnt get much sleep, but I would finish them overnight and ran and bought the rest of the ones I needed. At this time I'm now reading the Bible and I love it and will not stop reading it. I was a very catholic person, but now after Left Behind I have converted.I'm also reading a amazing book called Once a Catholic, is incredible. I thank both Mr. LaHaye and Mr. Jenkins for opening my eyes. And I think your grammar is excellent! Please harry anb finish the next book, I'm waiting. You guys are my HEROES!!!!!"
4,Can't Wait for the next,"Sure there was alot of review in this and the previous ones but that is for the people who havent read the first 7 books, I just skim through the review parts and enjoy the story, which I believe is a enjoyable interpretation of the book of Revelations."
4,I felt like I was there!,"At church the other day, during worship, I was thinking about what heaven would be like. For a momennt I got excited at the thought of meeting Tsion, Buck and the Tribulation Force...then I had to remind myself that they are fiction. The first half of this book was especially captivating. It took me through every emotion. It also taught me, as it relayed the authors opinions of last day events. Though fiction, I do believe that future events could be similar, and the Christians alive at that time will truly be my heros."
5,The Mark,"I thought the book was awesome! Many twists and turns. I thought this was the best in the series. The Indwelling wasn't nearly as exciting. On a religious note, I found it to be very accurate biblically and causes many to question their own life style. I would highly recommend it to all!!"
1,Enough already...!,I've read them all so far and had started to find them redundant and simplistic. This one put me over the top. Enough already. Get to the point. PLEASE don't write another 4 books to get to the end. I'm really disappointed. What started out as fascinating has been turned into something dull.
5,Great book!,What a blessing these books are! The Mark as well as the rest of the Left Behind series are excellent. The characters and the story line are fantastic. These books are a great witnessing tool as well. I have encouraged several people to read the books and some have been saved after reading them. I invite everyone to read these books you will not be disappointed. There is also a kid's series for your children to read. I have read these as well and they are just as interesting as the adult version. The series is also available as a dramatic audio and there is also a video on the first book. Once you start to read the books you can't put them down and even though the characters are fiction the story line is REAL. Thank you God for Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins and for giving them the knowledge and the talent to write these books.
2,disappointed,"I am shocked that the authors would dare publish such a sad excuse for a novel. I was a believer in Christ long before picking up the first book in the series, and I was quite moved with the first several books. However, it has become clear to me that the authors are simply looking for excuses to fatten their wallets and extend a book series to what will eventually be 12 books according to their web site. NOTHING happened in this book!! With the exception of Hattie's transformation there was no signinificant character development or advancements in the plot. I have lost a lot of respect for Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins."
3,Scripture based but 2 dimensional,"Face it, the only 2 reasons to read this book are that you've already read the previous books in the series, or you are interested in one possible future in the time of the Book of Revelations. I own up to both.Unfortunately, the authors have for several books now dropped their character development and vivid descriptions of the sets, places, and events in their books beyond the barest minimum necessary to get to the next evangelical episode. As the old saying goes, you catch more flies with honey than vinegar, I would have hoped the descriptions of the ruins of Chicago, the smells and sounds of Babylon after the Indwelling resurrection, and the emotional trauma of facing the death of a central characters beloved girlfriend would have generated a few more words and effort to attract some human emotions to this series.I hope the authors understand this message and bring the remaining books up to the level that the spiritual understanding has continued to be at."
2,Not Up to Usual,"When first introduced to the Left Behind series I completed the first seven books in approximately 10 days. I found them to be compelling, exciting and thourally enjoyable. I was so looking forward to #8 and literally was at the store as soon as it opened to purchase the book. I am very disappointed in The Mark. It is very slow moving, there seems to be no character development or growth. It was easy to put down and was definitely not the ""compelling read"" that I had so previously enjoyed. Of course I am not sorry that I read it and probably would recommend it to left behind readers however it is disappointing. I hope that more character development and story line development are in future books."
1,Christ Clone is a lot better!,"I kept reading Left Behind hoping it would get better. It didn't. I also read (actually started reading) We All Fall Down, but there the foul language was SO EXCESSIVE I couldn't keep going. Finally I read the books of The Christ Clone Trilogy (why do I feel like Goldilocks here?) and it was ""just right!"" Actually it was GREAT! So if you're tired of Buck and Rayford playing James Bond, and all the females in the LB world cooing, have a look at The Christ Clone Trilogy."
3,Read Christ Clone Trilogy,"I finished the series in a matter of two months. I just couldn't stop reading this incredible series. But I have got to say that if I hadn't read the Christ Clone Trilogy by James BeauSeigneur I would have missed out on the best end of times books I have ever read. This series seriously had me thinking the bad guys were good and the good guys bad until the third book in this series ""Acts of God"". I suddenly figured out how the antichrist's deception could really happen. So much more realistic then the left behind series. I sure hope book 10 picks up the pace!"
3,Would You Take the Mark?,"As a Christian, have you ever doubted your ability to stand up for your faith in Jesus in the face of overwhelming danger or ridicule? During the reading of this book, you will be able to determine for yourself which line you would go into: the Right or the Left.I found myself identifying strongly with the Christian prisoners in Greece who were forced to make a choice: the Right line or the Left line. This book allowed me to determine without a doubt which line I would fall into if forced. For this I am grateful to the authors and they achieved their purpose as far as I am concerned.As for as the ""Reader's Digest"" format, the light writing style, and the oversized font and spacing, try to ignore these annoyances and simply concentrate on an enjoyable little thriller."
1,Read a real Christian writer,"Dig up some old C.S. Lewis - he was a much better Christian writer (and writer, period)."
5,Sheer Fabulous Madness!,"This disc the two Ab Fab specials Last Shout and In New York. There are tons of fun extra features. This disc is a great choice for any fan of the show. If your into British humor and massive family dysfunction, this is a great pick for you! There's nothing quite like watching Patsy and Edina 'get along' with Saffy and 'the Old Woman'. The sarcasm and snide remarks are not in short supply with these two main characters around!"
2,"How lame could ""Gay"" be? Extremely","The New York special ""Gay"" is extremely weak. What makes it worse than just mediocre is the use of Whoopi Goldberg... the queen of unfunny comedians. Who let her into this special? They ought to be fired twice.It was Ab Fab in search of actual gags... horrible. Most everything flopped. Like at least one reviewer mentioned, Mo Gaffney is actually funny in this special (which is a pleasant surprise). Of course, Jane Horrocks as Bubble is fairly good, and she's just as good in her other appearance. ;)To be fair, most people are going to get this for ""The Last Shout""... and that's worth the price BBC/WB asks for, but it's still not as good as the good old days. Perhaps it's on par with series 4.Buy it if you must, but shake your fist in complaint because ""In New York/Gay"" is some of the worst drivel produced for television."
4,Fuji FinePix S5100,"Please, could anyone tell me if this product is compatible with Fuji FinePix S5100 ?Thank you!"
1,Possible power issue fix!!!,"I have been racking my brain trying to solve the power issue of trying to transfer large amounts of pictures to the iPod without it dying. Here is an idea that I haven't seen anyone mention yet, that involves not buying this camera connector at all: Apple sells a Y cable (or ""splitter"" cable) that has a male usb connector on one half, and a male firewire on the other. The intention of this cable is to allow charging of the iPod (by connecting the firewire half to a wall AC Adapter) and transfering to a computer (by connecting the USB half to a computer) at the same time.If you can charge and transfer at the same time in this situation, couldn't you also, in theory, connect a female to female usb gender changer to the male USB half of the Y cable, and then plug in your camera or a USB card reader to the resulting female USB plug, allowing full AC powered transfer?"
4,"great, but had some difficulties","The Apple iPod Connector is very good. It preforms as if you were connected to a PC, but it takes a little more time. I would reccogmend this to anybody who goes on vacation and takes a lot of pictures. But remember to not lose your camera USB Cable."
2,I'm an Apple fanboy ... but I don't recommend this product.,"I own a lot of Apple products but this is one that totally fell below expectations. I picked this product up on vacation in Las Vegas to store my pictures and thought it was an awesome idea.Unfortunately, it did not work well with my Panasonic Lumix camera. It would either run my 30GB iPod out of batteries or wouldn't transfer all the pictures. As mentioned, it's incredible slow too.On my recent trip to Italy, I brought a number of high capacity SD cards which are very low in price these days."
1,Unreliable,"I bought this product for a trip. Although it worked when I tried it at home, the first time I tried to use it on my trip it failed after downloading half the pictures from my camera. It then mucked up the ipod, nothing worked until I reconnected the ipod to my computer when I returned home.Basically, I found this to be a very unreliable product and a waste of money. I should have bought extra memory cards for the camera, instead of on this worthless product."
2,iPod Camera Connector,It's only OK -- can't select which photos you want to download from camera to iPod --forces you to take all of them whether you want to or not.
4,nice option to a pocket full of memory,"I bought this for my iPod Photo just before a trip to Italy in September 2006. We were gone for three weeks and took photos everyday (100-200 each day). Each night we downloaded the photos onto the iPod without problems. Yes, it took a bit of time but it was done while we were in the shower and dressing. Later in the evening we enjoyed the photos played back on the TV (if we had one available). We are now preparing for another trip to Italy (wine buying in Tuscany and Piedmont) for three weeks and looking forward to the same experience with the iPod Photo and the photo connector. Oh, yes, bring two iPods. One for the music in the car while experiencing Tuscany, Piedmont and Italian Riviera and the other to hold those precious photos. CIAO!"
5,This album is EXCELLENT!!!,"This album was my first taste of rai, and it was delicious!! Cheb Khaled has a wonderfully smooth and deep voice, and his melodies are incredible. THis album really is a fusion of all types of music and is nothing short of magnificent! I listen to the album every day at least once, and sometimes 3 times. I bought it in France at Fnac @ Les Halles, and I have been back for two weeks. It is the best souvenir I bought for myself in my travels! Cheb, shukran!"
5,Astoundingly Fantastic,"I have heard Khaled's music mature progressively into the next one, coming to Sahra which is one of the most evocative and melodious album I've ever heard. Aicha and Douha are par excellence. Truly hummable and an amazing musical treat !! Highly recommended."
5,"Great Melodies, Wonderful Voice","I am not a particular fan of Khaled. To be honest, I was introduced to his music by a friend about two years ago, when I discovered that one of my favourite songs from a group was indeed a cover/translation of one of his songs. To be honest, I loved this disc. I haven't heard much more of him beyond what is already here, but this disc made me want to explore a bit more his music."
2,Too little eclipse - too much Java,"I had hoped to find in this book the things I had not found out between the weeks I was started using Eclipse and the arrival of the book. I thought that it would detail in to the nitty gritty details that cost you hours to find out.Even though it covers Eclipse it seems more a Java programmer manual. The examples used in the book are a speech synthesis program and some Eclipse plugins. The problem is that way to many pages cover the code of the examples and the way to program them.If I had wanted to find out about those thing I would have bought a book about that. I wanted a book that told me about Eclipse, not about how to write a program."
1,Poorly made product,I recently purchased two of these adapters for a trip to Ireland. For those who are looking at buying this...DON'T. This adapter cost me two curling irons and a hair dryer. This item is a complete waste of money. I suggest that you continue looking for another adapter.
2,doesn't adapt two size prongs,Most US electrical devices now use a a plug with two different sized prongs. This adaptor does not allow for the longer prong. So if you're looking for an adaptor so you can dry/style your hair during your vacation - don't get this adaptor!
4,Useful in Ireland,This was part of a set of implements that allowed the use of a notebook on a recent trip to Ireland. I would recommend it.
5,Perfect!,"I bought this adapter for my trip to Ireland and Scotland and it worked great. Very simple to use, no issues with frying electronics and it's a great size - not too bulky."
2,Consider the sources,"Very disapointed with this book. Majority of the short stories, seemed more like ""war stories"" and not delivered with the essence of what was expected from a book with such a title. Don't be fooled."
2,Wrong tool,"I ordered this ten mm valve adjusting tool and the offer was for this set of feeler gauges with it. Well, It did not say what sizes they were and when I got it, it was worthless to me. Only one of the feelers was within the range I needed for the job I was doing."
5,Vol II is also Bellisima,"Actually I prefer this disc over volume one only because it contains more material from her best Italian Lp ""Love Italian Style"". her voice is more supple and the music and voice combined is like warm, soft candlelight, a glass of wine and thou. You can't get any better than Connie Francis. This collection was one of the first attempts to release her best material--her Lp work and I hope this is something we are going to see more of, particularly her latter cuts where she is at her vocal peak. Kudos to Polydor for this 2 set collection. Now that Universal has acquired the material, I hope they have the good sense to follow suit."
3,"Nice, but the mix is off","Dechen's voice is very nice. The problem is that in the final mixing the guitar and other instruments is too much in the foreground. Dechen's voice seems to be covered over and often you cannot hear what she is saying. This is also hampered by the fact that her voice is often near to the same octave as the instrumentation. This should have been fixed in the mix but alas, what could have been a much better CD is left wanting. On a number of tracks she sings background for herself and often this is not mixed well with the foreground voice also being obscured. She is obviously very talented but my conclusion is that this work is technically overreaching and many of the vocals and instrumentation overly complex.If you want to hear her in a much better work then start withDewa Che"
5,"If you love Mac, this is a must have.","This CD is full of good songs that range from country to pop to yes, classical. The title song, 'Cuttin Corners' is soft rock that sound quite sexy. 'Second Fiddle' is country/pop with a good beat. 'It's Easy' touches on classical with the acoustic piano. Everything Mac does, he does well and as is with a lot of Mac's songs, he tells a story. This is a great CD to listen to while driving on the interstate or while relaxing at home."
5,This Book Will Touch Your Pilgrim Heart!,"Sarah York brings intelligence, wit and astute observation to the complex subject of human transformation. No stranger to suffering herself, York's accessible text quickly builds your trust level to the point where you are able to see how her insights and illustrations touch points of meaning in your life. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is contemplating or in the midst of change . . . or everyone who wants to go deeper in their quest for meaning."
3,Hell in a cell,I love the fact that it included all cell matches but 1. I would give it 5 stars but the first disc was really scratched
4,I got passed the blurring,"This is a great set for fans of Attitude era FEDERATION fans. That was when the best of these matches occurred. Anyway, this set is missing one match (UNDERTAKER vs BOSSMAN) but everyone knows that.Now for the part that is annoying, at first.They have to blur out the classic attitude era scratch logo everywhere it appears on the screen and it can be distracting at first. They also have to blur out any visual WWF's and have to censor any verbal form of the abbreviation. It's still unclear to me why they aren't allowed to use the scratch logo anymore if they can use the classic one. I am aware of the lawsuit, but it still doesn't make sense why they have to blur it out.Aside from that this DVD set is really good. I even enjoyed the WWE era matches (I stopped watching wrestling shortly after the name change).I recommend this disc set to anyone who loves those brutal wrestling bouts."
2,This wasan't the best wwe DVD I've seen,this wasan't the best wwe DVD I've seen at all I mean yeah they did include all of the Hell in a Cell matches from 1997-2007 but however there was one Hell in a Cell match that they left out and that was Undertaker vs edge Hell in a Cell match from this year's SummerSlam pay per view overall I wouldn't reccomend this DVD to other people maybe my favorite wrestler Randy Orton should have a profile DVD from his life growing up to where he is right now Randy Orton deserves to have a DVD out one about his life that is and I would've wanted to know if the Hell in a Cell match between undertaker and edge was included in this three disc set but it's not included in this three disc DVD set at all I really hope they do a Randy Orton DVD.
3,This is a decent easy-listening CD,"I enjoyed this CD for easy-listening; it's good for hearing when there is quiet and one can really listen to it. It doesn't have any ""hooks,"" so it requires that listening where things come on their own. It's good for quiet times because it is beautiful."
3,Small Press Magazine,"""Susan Raab's An Author's Guide to Children's Book Promotion is a short but packed collection of tips and ideas for authors who want to take a more active role in marketing their own books, especially children's books...Raab's Guide is a handy and accessible reference full of useful pointers.""-- Small Press Magazine"
2,"A good treat, but...","Our rats love this treat, as they do with most type of treats we give them. I am only giving two stars after reading the list of ingredients. It contains a lot of sugar and partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (trans fat). Health authorities worldwide recommend that consumption of trans fat be reduced to a minimum as it is more harmful than naturally occurring oils. I assume it has the same effect on rats.There are a lot of good and healthy treats on the market, so why take the chance..."
3,"My rats like them, but they have hydrogenated oils","Like the title says, my rats go nuts for these things. But after looking at the ingredients list I saw they had hydrogenated oils, which are very bad. So I'm letting my rats finish them off, but after that I will not buy them again. But it seems like most treats on the market have the same ingredients. Also they melted together during shipping so it's like one giant block of yogurt treat. All in all, they are ok, but unhealthy and melty."
4,3 out of 4 rats approve,"3 out of my 4 rats go crazy for these, the other one is indifferent. I was happy to read on the ingredients list that it's not just a sugarbomb. Dairy can sometimes interfere with Doxycycline however, and perhaps other antibiotics, so if your rat is being treated for all-too-common mycoplasma you probably want to choose a different treat."
5,Great for Rats,My rats looooove these. I mean seriously they will do whatever i want them to for one of these. Helped me to litter train them!
1,Very unhealthy,"I got these as a treat for my dwarf hamster. I wasn't looking for some super health food, but I was kind of grossed out by the ingredient list. It is too large of a hydrogenated fat/refined sugar treat to give to my small hamster on any sort of regular basis. I don't recommend getting this as a regular treat. Really, I think your hamster would be much better off with a natural treat, like some raw carrot or a nut."
3,Irresistible treat but SUPER FATTENING! Not for diabetes prone species,"All the good reviews of this treat won me over to buy them for my new hamster, but I learned later that winter whites are diabetes prone species. I had to stop or limit the treats to no more than 1/3 of a drop a month. This treat is like candy since its mainly sugar and the crude fat is minimum of 21% which I find to be quite high. Also the smell is sickeningly sweet to me. And the use by date is about a year for the one I got which I don't find to be long enough. Since they're melty, I put them in the fridge or the freezer to prevent them from going bad and melting together. I like to rub a little bit of the treat on chew toys to encourage them to use it since my hamster tends to ignore them. These yogurt drops are really unhealthy, and should be used as special or rare treats than as regular daily treats."
1,"The Term ""Cruel and Unusual Punishment"" rings a bell...","I saw the commercials for this movie and could not WAIT to see it. When I rented it, I wanted to DIE! The commercials made it seem funny and politically incorrect (which I love), the movie is very preachy. It was like a two hour curch service with some special effects and no holy water. Skip it!"
1,AWFUL,I went to see this movie the day it came out. The theater was almost empty. All of the funny parts in this movie were given away in the previews and they wern't even that funny. I walked out of the movie after about 45 minutes. This is the first time I have actually wished the projector would catch fire and burn the tape. It was AWFUL.
2,Pales in Comparison,"Other than Brendan Fraser's performance, this was a poorly done movie. It's all very predictable, corny and stupid. A better movie is the original starring Dudley Moore. It deals with the subject of selling one's soul with intelligence and dry wit, something completely lacking in this movie."
3,Big Fun!!!,This movie is so funny!! I guarantee you will LYAO!! Brandon Frazer is the man!! My husband & I LOVE this movie!!
4,Hellaciously Funny by Director Harold Ramis,"Harold Ramis [Ghostbusters] put together a fun film with the every boyish Brendan Fraser and the ever hot English actress Elizabeth Hurley as the hellish devil.Brendan's character is a klutz with not too many social skills who just wants a change. The Devil gives him three wishes -- the first is a cheeseburger -- and the story goes. Elliott goes through some self-discovery and angst as he begins to realize that all he has ever wished for, he already has.I found the drug cartel one especially funny. I barely remember the Dudley Moore version and so won't attempt a comparison. The comedic timing and music are really well done. Kinda a morality slapstick play!Commentaries by the actors and director, a ""making of"" featurette and Spanish subtitles are a light fare for this DVD.Ghostbusters Double Feature Gift Set (Ghostbusters/ Ghostbusters 2 and Commemorative Book)"
4,"If you liked the commercials, you'll like the movie","This movie is what it claims to be. It's a funny, simple film about a guy wishing to be what he thinks will make him happy. This comes with a good, old fashioned lesson about being who we are and all that..... I would have given this film a 3, but the incredible performances of both Fraser (Encino Man, Gods and Monsters) and Hurley (Austin Powers, Permanent Midnight) make me really like this movie.Fraser is perfect as the lovable loser Elliot. His geeky personality is painful to watch and makes you route for some intervention, even the devil. When his wishes take turns for the worse is when Fraser is really showing a lot of comedic talent. He ability to show the different personas with the changes is great fun.Hurley is as about as sexy as the devil can be. She makes all the horrible things she does seem a little more fun. You may want to own this one. It's worth having for when you have friends over."
3,A One Joke Screenplay with a No Joke Ending.,"Brendan Fraser's Brilliant Comedic Timing and Elizabeth Hurley's Adequet Comedic Timing save this film from being a Comedy Dead Zone. Harold Ramis' films (especially ""Multiplicity"", ""Analyse This"" and ""Groundhog Day"") have always been more than just ""Good-for-a-laugh"" comedies. Unfortunately, that is Exactly what this film, and thats fine, but with Ticket Prices as high as they are, you may want to wait for Video and DVD.There are a few Laugh out loud moments and Liz gets into a few great outfits, but all-round, the laughs are few and far between. As for the ending.. Well, it is nearly a movie killer. The Laughs stop dead, for nearly the last half an hour, and that is unacceptable. It is a silly, calculated, contrived and downright stupid ending that makes you forget all the good stuff before it.If you are a real fan of the stars, see it and leave when theres half an hour to go, you'll have a much better impression of the film."
2,Rates the same as Mannequin,"I give it 2 1/2 stars because it has some redeeming, feel good things going on at the end. About the same as another goofball teen flick set in San Francisco with the sexy female who engages in sexy play acting with the goofy male lead, and does magical things - Mannequin. So if you think Mannequin is great, then you'll love this. Switcher, you are one sick puppy!The plot is somewhat similar to the original 1967 Bedazzled (which I would rate at 4 stars), but without the witty, funny dialog. And without Peter Cook's thought-provoking theological musings, or Dudley Moore's whimsical musical scoring. So the newer version of Bedazzled resembles the original in title only. And there's a big difference between a goofball teen flick and a classic witty black comedy. It's sort of like Stripes made up to follow the same plot as Dr. Strangelove."
2,Not worth to buy,"A movie full of nonsense... Bad scenario, bad acting... I dont think that this movie gives anything to the viewers even a smile."
4,"A good time, but you might want to rent it first...","Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley star in this comedy in which Fraser sells his soul to the Devil (Hurley) in exchange for seven wishes. The movie consists of sequences in which Fraser is living out each of his wishes. These sequences are VERY FUNNY at first, but they get less and less funny as they go on, to the point where they get tedious. When I saw this in the theatre, people's laughter decreased as the movie progressed because some of the ""punch lines"" are out of place. This movie has its moments, but it's not 100% funny. They also slap on a cheesy moral (""never wish to be somebody you're not,"" which would be Okay for a family film, but this is rated PG-13). If you are attracted to Elizabeth Hurley, buy this. Otherwise, watch it before you buy it. Overall, it's a good time to spend two hours."
4,Seven wishes? I only need one and it's Elizabeth Hurley!,"I recorded this movie on my DVR mainly because it was in HD and I had never gotten around to seeing it. It was really a pleasant surprise. I am not a fan of Brendan Fraser by any means, but he pulled off a bunch of characters and showed more of an acting range than I knew he had. The real star of the show is the devil herself. Elizabeth Hurley looks amazing in her many (and I do mean many) sexy outfits. Her face and body alone are worth watching for the 90 minutes, but her acting holds up good as well.Bedazzled isn't a great movie, or even a really good one, but there is enough humor and eye candy to keep almost anyone entertained.3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars"
2,Pass...,"Maybe it was just me, but I didn't find this very amusing or interesting for that matter...perhaps unlike others I don't find Liz Hurley all that... The premise of the movie is the lonely loser meets the devil and she gives him 7 wishes...Ya ok, believeable... The humorous parts weren't that funny...and I think they could have picked a better loser than Brendan Fraser..although I think Liz Hurley played her part to a T... I wouldn't recommend this film unless you like sappy lightweight humor movies..."
5,IT'S AWSOME!!!,I only saw this yesterday!This is a great funny comedy yet for more adult ages. It's about this guys who sells his sould to the devil only to win over this girl 'Allison'. (who might I add isn't very pretty) So then he tries to get out of his 7th wish but....won't tell you the rest. Buy this!
3,Disappointing for Brendan Fraser fans,"OK, so maybe I don't like to see a cute guy playing a geek. And a really, really geeky er, geek! But Brendan Fraser just didn't do anything for me in this movie. So I think I'll stick to The Mummy etc.This film isn't funny. If you like really cringe-worthy humour, then yeah, you'll be laughing so much, you'll be crying. But it just wasn't funny.Elizabeth (or Liz, as she'll always be known) Hurley was great in this film. That is, until she opened her mouth, and that English accent was like nails going down a blackboard. Bet the Americans went nuts for the accent though, but I just couldn't look at her and hear the voice.The finale is a tiny bit strange, and you have to look at the cast listing to understand what the hell is going on. But its understandable - eventually.A good film. Just not funny."
2,Not so bedazzling,I wasn't a big fan of the movie. I thought it was stupid. Ben Frazier wasn't that great and Elizabeth Hurley wasn't any better.
1,The worst of Brendan Fraser,"I love Brendan Fraser, but even MonkeyBone was better than this one. I didn't even laugh. A very predictable movie that just does not hit the spot. Sorry Brendan!"
3,cute movie,i bought this for my boyfriend its one of his favorites - likes lusting over her. = ) its a cute movie love the credit they give God in it and doing good for others is always best - shines godly love!
2,"Smiles only, no laughs.","Can`t understand why many people rate this movie as one of the year`s best...It`s a so, so comedy, not with too many laughs. One that`ll keep you tuned on cable TV, but I doubt you`l watch it again and again on your DVD.Video transfer is very good, sound also, using the surround speakers and sub channel very well.Elizabeth Hurley and Brendan Fraser seem to be doing something while they had nothing else to do. Their acting is a passtime. So is this movie.If you`re a fan of Hurley, she`s better and sexier on Austin Powers. If you`re a fan of Fraser, look for The Mummy."
2,"What the ""hell"" was i thinking??","This movie was a joke(unfortunately not in a good way)!When i heard of it,it looked promissing because Fraser and Hurley were starring in the movie,and i'm a fan of both.So,What went wrong?I`ll tell you what went wrong:This movie provides nothing new,maybe except for the script,that i thought it was somewhat good and not usual in a comedy film,that's why i rated 2 stars instead of 1!Even a stupid ten year old kid could write better jokes than the ones on this movie!Don't waste your money on this one!"
3,Hey this movie is not so bad....,"I just finished viewing ""bedazzled"" with Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley. This was one movie that I had read bad reviews about, and I left it on the shelf at the video store. Well tonight, some jerk had not returned my reserved copy of Space Cowboys, and Bedazzled was the only movie I had not seen that was available. I held my nose and rented it. Hey this movie is not so bad. Brendan Fraser plays 8 completely different characters with some degree of skill, and Hurley does her Austin Powers beauty role with a great deal of comic timing and wit. Don't expect too much. Its a solid 3 stars - a light hearted romp, that has more going for it than the Dudley Moore version. Hurley's easier on the eyes too."
3,Ho Hum...,"Geek loves Girl. Girl ignores Geek. Geek sells his soul to the devil for seven wishes to help get the Girl. It's a mediocre romantic comedy. If you're a huge fan of the leads, worth a see. Otherwise, ho hum..."
3,Bedazzled-Not your average Devil movie,"Ok, I may not go to church, or pry or do any of that stuff, so I thought that the thought that the devil could be Elizabeth Hurley was quite amuzing. I saw her in both Austin Powers movies, and she seemed so different in this movie. Elliot (Fraiser) the office geek who has no real friends, just thinks he does, goes to a bar one night, unsuspecting that he would meet the devil. At first when he exchanges a few words with his crush, Alison, she walks away when Elliot is looking the other way. He says he'd ""Give anything to have that girl in his life,"" Elizabeth Hurley comes into the scene. A wonderful sexy devil, she bears several revealing outfits. I for one praise The cast of this movie, for makeing a new version of the older one, in 1967. I hope this is helpful, and have a Happy New Year!"
4,"Can stand on its own, even as a remake","The original version with Cook and Moore was great, but this version has enough charm and wit to carve its own place. Brendan Fraser has had an up-and-down film career, to be sure. Some of his film choices have been, well, less than bedazzling. But he really gets to shine in this film. He essentially plays 6 or 7 variations of the same desperate character, and he breathes great comic life into all of them. As The Most Emotionally Sensitive Man In The World and a Very Manly Basketball Player, Fraser shows remarkable comic talent. His character's office co-workers also appear as supporting characters in his wish/fantasy segments, and they are delightful in minor but comical bits.It is not always fair to compare remakes to the originals, and in this case ""Bedazzled"" is a film title with TWO very funny and clever versions."
4,For its time an ok movie,"They could have added more comedy to the story, but I think it is an ok movie for a night."
3,Slick Hollywood formula film->forgettable,"In the pastThe Devil And Daniel Websterand you could meet the devil at the crossroads and become a famous musicianby selling your soul.Having met some of the people in Hollywood, it is likethey don't need the devil, you know?Dan Brown, of da Vinci code fame, went there and failed to sell his soul in the music business.I saw this right after it came out on TV: I forgot it.You pretty much watch it and then, forget it.Next time you see it, the movie is pretty much brand new...forgettable."
4,NO SNAKE SCENE,"This was a pretty funny movie, Branden Fraser does his multi-part role with plenty of laughs, and Elizabeth Hurley plays the she devil part well, and she looks great as always...my main gripe about this movie is the misrepresentation given on the box, especially to those who might buy or rent the movie with the presumption that you are gonna see sexy Elizabeth Hurley in a red bikini w/ a snake. A snipet of the scene is even shown in the movies trailer, but it was deleted from the movie. Hurley herself mentions the scene in an interview, and they told her what snake scene?, it's not in the movie. Why it is'nt in the movie, but on the box and was in the commercial for the movie is absurd....still a good movie, just be aware you ain't gonna get that snake scene."
4,Not Bad,"This movie isn't too bad. Actually it is halarious at times. The overall message of the moving is great, so there's a actually you learn something by watching this movie. The special effects are pretty good, the setting seems to be San Francisco."
3,not quite what I expected,"I realize that this is a remake of the 1967 film, but I found the plot to be somewhat interesting yet a little far fetched. Elizabeth Hurley's playing the devil?...Come on! I think the movie would have made more sense if she was a sorceress instead of the devil but that's just my opinion. I have seen some of the movies that Elizabeth Hurley has been in and I have to agree that her looks have brought her much fame in Hollywood."
3,Guy Flick,"I predict that men will like this movie more than women, because of Elizabeth Hurely, but it barely had a plot, and the previews basically gave it away."
1,ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzz,"Snore feast! This movie is garbage. Not funny, predictable and done many times before. Someone tell Brandon he can't act. The only positive point I can make is Hurley looks great! Wait for HBO and save your money."
1,terrible,"this is one of my favorite underdog movies, but when the package arrived, despite still having the plastic wrap around the dvd case, there was no dvd inside. Do not buy from this company"
1,Bedazzled Scores A New Low.............,"I went to see this movie at a special for-free screening and was mad because it wasted my time. This movie is not entertaining flat out. One: The story has been done to death. This version does put more comedy into it but not enough to talk about. Two: All the best parts were on the preview. I know it's a cliche' but it's true if you watched the preview there is no need to see the movie , other then to waste an hour and a hlf of your life. Three: totally predictable build up with the most anti-climactic/entertaining ending of 2000! The only thing Bedazzling about this movie was Liz Hurley's outfits. Sorry, 1 star"
4,Very funny,"This is a clever story, and the roles are acted beautifully. Elizabeth Hurley is devilish -- what a naughty teen she must have been!"
4,Fun movie,"This is such a fun movie. The whole stealing souls thing has been done countless times, but the main characters in this are fun , and the storyline is simpistically funny, and even a little philosophical. Great saturday night with friends flick."
2,Funny for a MINUTE!,"This movie was kind of funny with the man's 1st wish, but as the movie went on and on it got really boring and predictable. You are better off getting something else and more funny. I seriously almost fell asleep during this movie! GET SOMETHING ELSE! There is a major reason why this movie is so low priced! Waste your moola on something that is a real COMEDY!"
4,Pretty good,"I thought this was a really great movie. Some parts were predictable, but such is the case with most films of this genre."
1,Way Too Much Language,"I was really disappointed to find that I wasted my money on this movie only to realize that the F*** word makes up every other word in the first 5 minutes of the movie. Offensive, completely un-necessary, repulsive, juvenile, annoying... The list goes on and on. It completely ruined the possibility of me continuing to watch this movie. I'm a young, educated woman. I don't want to hear that ridiculous mess. It is a turn off and absolutely ruins the movie-watching experience for me. What a waste of good talent when the writers/director/producers can't or aren't willing to come up with anything more educated than having the actors say ""F*F*F*F*F*F*F*F*F*"" repeatedly."
3,Bought it for Scott Porter...,"Upon first viewing I hated it. It's so predictable. Not a good story at all. But I love Scott Porter and if you like him, it's worth a watch. Gave it 3 stars because I think Scott's so perfect, it was good to see a different version of him for once."
4,One of the better date movies,"This one has a nice pace. I was drawn in from the start. The tale is Wall Street meets Friends meets When Harry Met Sally, sort of. I wasn't familiar with these young Hollywood stars and starlets. Andrew McCarthy of ""The Breakfast Club"" plays the Gordon Gecko character on Wall Street here. This is a boy gets girl film, but the twists are interesting. Worth watching."
3,Appearances Can Be Deceiving?,It's an interesting story that's well-told with well-placed flashbacks and cleverly left out details that are revealed later.But I struggle to find a message to the story. It's essentially a chase to see who ends up being the good guy out of the two.Is the new guy going to take the lessons taught by the seasoned guy and take his job as well as his girl?Or is the seasoned guy too good to be true?The reveals at the end are believable but fall onto rather uni-dimensional character archetypes. And the good guy only ends up being the good guy because he's just not as ridiculously bad as the other guy.
2,boring,"They show you the end of the movie at the beginning. There's no real character development, it jumps around a lot. It's narrated by the guy you're supposed to hate, not even by the girl. What?"
2,The Good Guy but unenjoyable film,Did not like this show at all too much unnecessary language for me and very predictable outcome without a real conclusion. Not great performances by the stars which is a shame.
2,Not so good,"This was not a good movie. It is Boring, slow and predictable. Watch another movie as there are plenty of movies out there."
1,Don't wast your time!!,"Don't waste your time watching this movie because you will regret it!! The story-line, acting and the writing was terrible, so basically the whole movie was dreadful. What I regret most is that I will never get back the time I wasted watching this stupid movie. I was hoping for a nice funny romantic film, but I was very disappointed and it was simply boring. Save your money and time!!"
5,Well done!,"As previously noted, Site 18 details the experiences of a young radio operator in post-WWII Japan- during the height of the Cold War.Mr. Waldron authentically recreates both time and place, introducing and bringing to life a likeable assortment of characters. Memorably etched in anecdotes featuring- among other things- fake birth announcements, ""Mohawks,"" and Horseback Inspections!You don't have to be ex-military to appreciate this interesting and enjoyable book!"
4,Beautiful but not full size,"It's a really great replica however, as others have mentioned, It's smaller than the ones in the movie. The chain is very pretty too! When I'm not wearing it, I leave it out because the whole thing is lovely and very movie accurate."
4,"Good,classic western",I really liked Gary Cooper in this role. He was very handsome. Jean Author was good as Calamity Jane. There were some exciting sequences in the movie. I would have given it 5 stars but I don't like unhappy endings.
4,Jean Arthur fans will like this one!,"This film was one of Jean Arthur's favorites. Jean enjoyed playing the role of Calamity Jane, although CJ never looked this good! Neither in films nor in real life was Jean Arthur a ""girly girl."" Jean had to learn to crack a whip for this one and she is great! Cecil B. DeMille spins a pretty hysterical story by implausibly bringing together a host of famous Western characters: a veritable famous old westerner ""one-stop-shop."" I laughed a lot at the story, and admired Jean's wonderful performance!"
3,Great apart from all the censorship...,"The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man in Sports EntertainmentOverall this is a pretty good buy for any wrestling fan, it includes most of the Rocks most famous and most exciting matches (The Kurt Angle matches are a must). I gave this 3 stars because of all the WWF logo cover ups, I mean seriously why on earth the World Wildlife Foundation thinks it's necessary for the WWE to blur everything out is beyond me, at times it's ridiculous..I mean covering up the logo on the belt? Arghhhh...they really should be some sort of warning, because it could ruin alot of peoples viewing."
5,the rock,"very recommand, original and best disk ever made, i'm one of million & million of rocks fans, i recommand to try it,"
3,Almost the Most Electryfying DVD in Sports Entertainment,"Ok - so i'm a huge Rock fan. BUT, wouldn't it be smart to actually interview the man for his own DVD???Not once do they sit down with The Great One. The narrator just goes through his career from start to finish... discussing rivalries and battles etc...It's all story.. We never hear what he was thinking about his matches.. How he got along with people backstage.. Problems he had on the road.. Nothin!!So, it's good cause it has a tonne of his matches, but also kind of annoying because you never get his opinion on anything.. (Compared to the Triple H - King of Kings or The Legacy of Stone Cold DVD where they talk about what they went through at certain stages).Great backstage segments - excellent for a laugh.."
3,The Rock Is The Greatest WWE Entertainer Alive But...,"WWE Should Strongly Consider Leaving Out The Royal Rumble, Wrestlemania And Soon To Be Released On An Anthology Summerslam Matches Out Of This Collection. For One Thing These Matches Are on The PPV DVDs Already. And The Wrestlemania 17 Match Is On Many Other Non-PPV DVDs. And Coming Back To The Anthologies, Since They Are Available In Volumes. I Don't Think Many People Would Have A Hard Time Obtaining Those Royal Rumble, Wrestlemania And Soon Summerslam Matches. So If Somehow WWE Sees This PLEASE DO NOT INCLUDE THOSE MATCHES and include others not currently available on DVD, and then this will truly be an electrifying collection !!!!!"
2,don't know about this one?,"I will not get this one. sure having a good backstory can be a nice sell but the rock has had too many DVDs made about him. (I really wonder how much of it will be new and how much will just be taken from his old DVDs)the matches really don't do much either, 4 vs. HHH, 3 vs. Mankind, 2 vs. austin along with 5 other matches are from raw or smackdown (meaning we will get cut outs for commericals). Plus none the matches listed on the DVD have that ""lost gem"" feeling.WWE just put this together without any though because the name of ""the rock"" can still sell. (sadly)"
1,Geeez... He needs to be forgotten,"The Rock...Great wrestler. A long time ago. The business needs to just forget about him just he like forgot about the business ""if you smell what DWAYNE is cookin""?"
3,Not enough of his funny interviews..,"Although the rock may have been one of the most entertainig supserstars, this compilation doesn't give him as much credit as he deserves. There's not a lot of his funny intereviews and when you are done watching all 3 discs, you're left wondering, ""What about that time he...."" or ""Hey, they forgot about that one..."""
2,Not Worth Owning,"This dvd like the triple h dvd set was a huge let down for me. I'm glad I didn't fork out $20 for this set, instead I watched a friends copy. If you want most if not all of the rock's promos featured on this set, UNBLURRED do yourself a favor and try and find the 2 disc edition of Just Bring It. I also recommend owning the older WWF dvd's ""Know Your Role"" and ""The People's Champ"" forget owning this one."
1,Terrible,"while the mounting options aren't too bad, this thing fails at the rather basic function of mirroring. the surface of a mirror is smooth. the surface of this is not. reflections are wavy and distorted - and I don't mean the distortion inherent in a convex mirror, I mean waves across the surface. don't buy it, buy a smooth mirror."
3,Hmmmm......It's OK.,"My initial use for this was to see my son, who is now forward facing, while I was driving without having to adjust the rearview mirror. Other reviewers are correct in saying that the view you receive is really small and it make it difficult sometimes to see if my son is asleep or not. Also, the suction cup isn't the best and it falls down at times. Because of all these issues I really don't use it anymore for it's intended use...but I still use it! In both my car and my husband's car my son's seat is behind the passenger, which makes it more difficult for a nosey passenger to see what's going on back there! I've actually taken this mirror and suctioned it to the passenger window, pointed it at an angle and now I can see what's going on without having to turn around. This is actually the best use I have found."
1,worthless,"I never imagined it would be so small, I could hardly see it in my mirror, let alone see my baby reflected in it. The suction cup does not work. It never stayed up on the window for more than two minutes. no matter how cheap it was- it was paying money for nothing."
2,Non extendable arm,The arm is too short and can not be extended making it difficult to use because my car has a steeply slanted windshield.
3,Confusing description,"It looks that are two mirrors in the package, but its just one, I though that was one for the front of the car and another for the rear window, but no, its only one mirror with two different options to use... I'm just installing, and hope it dont fall with drive."
2,Disappointing,"The premise was good, but the pacing was slow and the ending was lousy. I don't understand the enthusiasm for this book."
2,"Starts out great, ends flat","After 50 pages I was thinking that this is the kind of book I would buy for my friends and make them read it for their own good. But once the story turned fantastic it really bombs. Other writers have put the magical into ordinary circumstances and wrote great books (""The Master & Margarita"" or stuff by Shirley Jackson), but this guy basically wrote an episode of the ""Twilight Zone"". The main character is the most unlikeable guy I've come accross since I read ""The Fountainhead"". He is a whiney, selfish, self centered, un-clever Hawkeye Pierce from MASH, and since he is the narrator, he is in every page and every sentence. The author basically stops writing the best character, Saxony, like he got bored with her. This book has some great stuff, but mostly it seems uninteresting baloney that would sit nicely next to ""Peace Like A River""."
2,"A beginning, a muddle, and an abrupt end","The numerous ""Twilight Zone"" references in these reviews should be seen as a negative, not a positive. Original episodes were 22 minutes -- for a reason... the stories could not sustain the willing suspension of disbelief longer than that. Witness the numerous misfires when the show was expanded to an hour. Carroll's book crashes and burns early for the same reason... among others: a nasty, unprepossessing and utterly passive lead character who settles for being told everything rather than discovering anything; the abandonment of another main character in mid-tale; and a completely rushed, totally undeveloped finale. The tale literally just stops -- dead. An extremely unsatisfying read."
2,Not as creative or as entertaining as I had hoped.,"I know that there is a difference between not liking a book and not liking a character in a book but in this case I couldn't help not liking this book or its author because of the novel's protagonist. The protagonist was dull and a male chauvinist. I was not compelled to empathize with the character on any level and I mostly found myself hoping for something awful to happen to him in the end. And when nothing awfully suited happens to him (At least nothing bodily awful happens to his character. If his lover is blown up, being the male chauvinist that he is, why would he care about a woman? They're all the same and completely interchangeable, right?), I was only disappointed that I wasted my time reading this 'C' minus book when there are so many other good books to read out there."
3,"by anyone else , an absolutely INCREDIBLE first book...","...but from jonathan carroll, i felt it to be somewhat of a disappointment. right when i got to that point where there were but thirty pages left for me to read, this one really started to lose that bit of magic that we find in all of carroll's writings. just a real disappointment, the ending to this one. don't think i'd be one to tell you what it is, though. it's just that it was unneccessary; none of you won't see it coming from when you're just half of the way through the book. not bad, though. not bad at all."
5,Land of Laughs -- and terror,"The first of Jonathon Carroll's books I've read, this one remains very high on the list. The book starts off as a light-hearted romp and ends up an edge-of-the-seat horror novel, and it succeeds admirably in both areas."
4,A good introduction to the work of Carroll,"I don't think it will be for everyone, but this is a fine novel with a terrific ending. It is a work that begins slowly and builds to a terrific climax. Carroll has written many fine horror tales and I think this is his best. Not quite Ray Bradbury but very close."
5,Carroll shifts our perceptions of everyday reality ...,"I first starting getting into Jonathan Carroll when I read ""After Silence"" and was delighted to have found such an original and engaging author. Needless to say this was followed by disappointment when I realised how much of his work was out of print and difficult to obtain, so I was delighted to read on Amazon.com that ""The Land of Laughs"" was to be reprinted.This story, like most of Carroll's work, starts out set firmly in the real world, but as it progresses the boundaries of experience are shifted, until it becomes mind-blowingly surreal. Somehow - and this is the true strength of Carroll's writing - I found myself accepting even the most outrageous ideas as if they were somehow natural and inevitable.I must say that I didn't like the ending - not that it wasn't the right ending, or even the inevitable one, but I just didn't want it to end up like that for the characters involved ... or for the book to end at all, for that matter ..."
2,"good features, bad sound quality",this product has excellent build quality and features. the aluminium case is very sturdy and the headphone 'remote' is layed out well. HOWEVER! i have never heard such a terrible sounding discman before. the music came out very muffled in the low end and a little distorted at times. i would not recommend this.
1,What Happened?,"I have owned several Sony Discmen. This Discman, the most recent that I bought, has all of the features that I wanted, except one, the most important one--good sound. This Discman in fact sounds worse--muddier, weaker, more distorted--than other Sony units costing one-third the price of this unit. This Discman is among the most disappointing purchases I have ever made."
1,Terrible Sound Quality,"Previousely to trying the D-EJ985, I owned a D-ES55, which was manufactured about five years ago and was large enough to house electronics that could provide clear and strong bass output. The D-EJ985, however, is very small and cannot give any bass clarity. The sound was terrible and I returned my unit. I'd rather spend the money to have my D-ES55 repaired. Anyone hoping for clear bass notes will try another player. LISTEN BEFORE YOU BUY!"
2,Disappointing collection,"Those of you who may have read that this collection has vector art files--beware. There are .eps files but they merely contain jpgs of the clipart. While the selection is OK, I found the artwork to be a little shabby. It seemed like they were scanned from something. Some types of designs that I were hoping would be in there, like kimono motifs, were not. Is it useful? Certainly. Disappointing? Definitely."
4,"Very nice for faces, animals and repeating motifs","I've been looking through this series for ideas for polymer and metal clay jewelry designs. The faces and figures are lovely, and the repeating motifs of flowers and geometrics are very nice. The dragons are a little lame, but I like Chinese dragons. The gin spirits are delightful and so active, they more than make up for the lazy dragon motifs. A very passible source for design ideas."
5,wow!,"This cd takes you on a journey, a pleasant journey. I truly love the 2nd song called ""do you"" featuring Ray-ray, it makes me want to give my husband a hug. ""All for love"" is just really smooth and the whole cd is just great. I recommend it to anyone who loves music."
3,lacking in the qualilty I expected,"While I love the voice of Pavorotti, I was disappointed in this CD. It's clearly copies of recordings, and doesn't have the quality I have heard on earlier cd's.I would recommend getting his cd's of his actual recordings, not a compilation cd like this."
2,What the heck?,"I'm so glad I didn't pay for this disc, instead checking it out from the my public library. The first track, ""Caruso"", had me thinking I was playing the wrong CD. It's not so much that it's electronic accompaniment. It's really bad synthesizer music. Horribly bad. Inexcusably bad. Cheap-lounge-singer-who-can't-afford-a-piano bad. That train wreck of track sets exactly the worst tone, destroying the mood for the rest of the album. If it weren't for some of the later selections from La Bohème and L'Elisir d'Amore, this CD would be a total loss. Even then, these gems are completely drowned in a gushing flow of treacly Italian ""classics"" apparently aimed at a certain demographic of blue-haired, tittering Pavarotti fans. I don't mean to sound like a snob. It's just the bad vibe from that first track rattling me. My advice: get it from the library and listen to your favorites. Avoid everything else on pain of intense aural assault."
1,Not latest singing before he died,Disappointed again. Early version of him singing. I want to hear his last few years. Don't need to say anything else.
2,The Very Best of Luciano Pavarotti,"This weekend I purchased ""The Very Best of Luciano Pavarotti"", Romantica. The first track, Caruso is terrible. Classical music, opera, etc, should never be played with synthesized anything! This is especially true with voices like Pavarotti's. This first track was CHEAP and tinny sounding.Pavarotti is good, but I think that the title is misleading.Classical music should be with real musical instruments. Lesson #1, if it takes electricity, it's NOT a musical instrument."
3,Video Quality Not As Good As Expected,"While this cable works just fine, I was underwhelmed by the quality of video translation from PDA/Phone to Large Screen. Part of the problem, with Touch Pro2, is that you can't use this video out cable at the same time as synchronizing the phone with your PC. Another issue is that I normally use a dock that has the Phone standing vertically...when the video out cable is connected, the screen display orientation switches to Horizontal (Landscape)."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"Not a very good product at all! Cheaply made. I didn't know it was a generic - I couldn't tell from the product description that was shown when I purchased them. It inferred that it is OEM, but it's not!"
5,12 (3x4) Oral-B EB-17 -12 Power Toothbrush Replacement Brush Heads,"Genuine parts from ""YoungZebra"" - Fits on Oral-B electrical toothbrush model ""ProfessionalCare 8500DLX"""
3,oral b,not exactly what I thought the product was. it was not exactly like the ones that came with the triumph. but they will do.
1,Wouldn't buy again.,"This item was advertised as being compatible with all models of the Oral-B battery-powered toothbrush. The brush heads appeared to fit my Oral-B toothbrush but it kept popping off the shaft while in use. After less than a (frustrating) month of use, a metal piece dislodged from within the brush head, making it totally unusable. The 4mm cylindrical metal piece dislodged into my mouth and could have caused injury if aspirated into my lungs."
4,An important point,"This is a great book, and still relevant. It suggests that evolution has been running at different speeds in the different areas of human biology, culture and science, and uses this distinction to try and understand why mankind is so very bad at dealing with long-term threats like global warming. The proof of Ornstein's central idea is in the increasing cartoonisation of the world that has continued in the media since the book was published. We are essentially still monkeys. argue the authors, monkeys with clever toys, and we still respond to threats like bangs and baby-snatchings in exactly the same way that we used to when we lived in caves, and the modern media and its masters know this. If anything the so-called 'War on Terror' proves the authors point 15 years after the book was written."
2,The Velveteen Rabbit VHS,"I have owned numerous copies of The Velveteen Rabbit on VHS by FHE. I have never had a good quality tape yet and this latest one is especially awful. The sound quality was faded right from the start. As a Mom of an Autistic child that loves to rewind, and play the same part over, this tape cannot handle it. It will bend, curl so easily. I have had Disney movies last for years, like 10 years. I love this movie and I just hope they put it on DVD soon."
5,Every child should have this....,"Every child should have this tape. It has a touching story, great graphics and terrific narration. You can't help but fall in love with the little velveteen rabbit!"
1,Worthless book,"Aside from a few interesting sidelights on journalists' working conditions fifty years ago, in the Dark Ages of news gathering, this book is a complete waste of time. Poorly written, quoting long, unimportant conversations no one could possibly recall in such detail, amateurish in the extreme, this book did not deserve a publisher. What a waste of money and time. It provides some of the flavor of the public consternation felt at the time, but that doesn't compensate for the horrible boredom of the rest of the book. And even those aspects were ruined by incompetent writing skills."
4,"Covers not only the crimes, but the aftermath and Caril's incarceration","A thorough, no-frills account of the Fugate/Starkweather case. Their murder spree resulted in the deaths of 10 people in Nebraska and Wyoming in the 1950s and was notorious at the time, but is largely forgotten today. The author, one of the journalists who originally covered the story, records the trials, Starkweather's execution and Fugate's prison sentence and appeals in meticulous, minute-by-minute detail.I only wish there had been some speculation or insight into what caused Starkweather to go off, and whether his girlfriend was a willing accomplice or a terrified hostage as she later claimed. I wish Ann Rule would write on this."
4,Perfect size!,This bag is the perfect size for under the seat or even overhead bins on commuter carriers. It can fit a laptop + accessories as well as a change of clothes & cosmetics. Great for a quick trip or as the bag to take on the plane for longer trips.
3,Thought it would be roomier,"Thought there would be more room in the interior. Also, it is a challenge to get it down the aisle of the airplane because of the width."
1,not as convenient as website description,"The telescoping handle takes up much of the room in the 'largest' compartment, therefore packing even for overnight (particularly heavy clothing) is not easy....in addition this product (supposedly designed by stewardesses?) was too wide to roll down the aisle of an average airplane (Airbus 3 and 3 seat)"
2,Not what I was hoping for,"This is a very well constructed rolling tote, that is not the problem. It is poorly engineered and will not stand on it's little wheels. I took it on a trip to Alaska right after I bought it, and it fell over 9 times out of ten. If you are one to not completely fill your tote, this might work better but I don't see why it would be a benefit to have a bag that only worked when partially full."
1,ZIPPERS BREAK,"I have several Baggallini products which I love. I bought this 2/09 for an upcoming trip. There were only a few items in the bag, yet the clothes compartment zipper came apart before I got to the airport! Rezipped several times - zipper came open each time. Rather stressful having one's underwear on display at the airport & taxi stand. Even 1/4 full it is too large for under the seat. On the return trip I checked the empty bag with its opened zipper. Returned it & got my money back. Other sites have reviews that cite the same problem."
2,Zipper Issues,"Although I love the form and function of this bag, the bag has had zipper issues since day one. The plastic zippers get stuck in place. And the bag is not overfull. Vaseline helps!"
2,"Too descriptive, too lengthy","This book pulled me in two directions. It annoyed me and entertained me at the same time. The picture that Ansa paints with her words are gorgeous. The descriptive writing is good, however, I WISHED SHE WOULD GET ON WITH THE D#@* STORY!!!!!!!! I didn't care how the story ended because I didn't ""know"" the characters. Yeah, I got lots of background stories about Lena and the people around her, but I rarely caught a glimpse of who she was as a person during the situation she was going through in the present. I only knew how others perceived her due to the copious amount of descriptions that Ansa provided. I stopped reading the book about halfway through. I only got halfway though because I was determined to finish it this time (2nd time trying to read it). I couldn't do it.If you want to read it, check it out at the library."
3,"A Good Read, However...","""The Hand I fan with"", the sequel to Ansa's first book ""The Baby of the Family"" was a good read, it would have been much better if the author did not dwell so much on the materialistic Lena, but the warm and spirited Lena, I found it to be intertesting but a little boring. The fact she was born with a ""veil over her face"" was overrated, but I found it neccessary to tie in the ghost lover. I found the story sweet, a nice romantic ghost story. It seems as though the writer wanted evryone to really connect with Lena, so I think she went a little overboard, but I sitll reccommend the book as a good read. However ""Ugly Ways"", was her better book."
5,MUST READ,"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK BUT STARTS OFF A LITTLE SLOW. EVER HEARD THE SAYING "" THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEAN?"" JUST GIVE ANSA A MINUTE TO GET INTO THE FLOW OF THE BOOK AND SHE WILL HAVE YOU BEGGING FOR MORE."
3,All parts of the book,"This book is good and the author IS a gifted writer and the story is good. That story had so much realness in terms of emotions. Like, We all want those thing she had and received from Herman. The love story is good and the reminiscences are good. It is kind of long-winded, though. Like I could relate to the love and I gave it to my man cuz it reminded me of our relationship. But I knew he probably didn't read it because it took so long to get into it. Lot of details But overall good. If you really like to read a lot then get it. If not skip it."
5,Blistering!!,When I heard this book was about ghosts I thought nah! But I couldn't possibly pass up an opportunity to get better aquainted with Lena. She'd captivated me in 'The Baby of the Family' and I was ready for more. I am really glad I persevered. The plot is tight and you find yourself rooting for an improbable ending. As a bonus the love scenes are scorching!
5,"Excellent Book, read it!","Excellent book, enjoyable read. Great characters and very visional. Also, very interesting story and love interest!"
2,"Too Much Detail, Not Enough Conflict","I found this book to be a real let-down after Baby of the Family. Like Baby of the Family, this book was rich in detail and speech. However, in Hand, I kept waiting for something to happen to Lena, the main character. Sure, she summons up a ghost and has lots of sex and love. The problem is, everytime the story started to move forward and show a little conflict (a female ghost rival, an angry town that feels forgotten by Lena), the conflict is resolved far too easily. The book encourages us to stop concentrating on the material and enjoy life as Lena learned to do, but it was hard for me to identify with a woman who can stop working with no financial impact on her or her lifestyle (huge piece of land, beautiful house, nice clothes, horses, top-notch car, etc.) I think Lena's in an far easier position to drop it all than most of us and her transformation was uninspiring. I'd put this one at the bottom of the three Ansa books."
2,HATED IT,"KEEPING IT SHORT AND SIMPLE. I THINK THE CHARCTER RECALLED TOO MANY EVENTS OF THE PAST. IN FACT I SCHEMEED THROUGH THE BOOK A LOT. THE INTIMATE SCENES WERE GOOD, BUT TELL ME WHO COULDN'T CONSTRUCT A GOOD LOVE SCENE IF THEY PUT THEIR MIND TO IT. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR YOUR LIBRARY. ALTHOUGH IT IS IN MINE BECAUSE I PURCHASED IT BEFORE I KNEW.DONT WASTE YOUR TIME."
1,too many descriptions -,"I know some books take some time to develop and i enjoy lengthy descriptions, but unfortunately every page is a lengthy description of every possible thing. I was reallly looking forward to a nice read - but had to stop after 70 pages."
1,Much Too Slow!!,"I completely agree w/ the other one-star reviews. The book started out much too slowly -- who cares about Lena's clothes, memories, and so on? Let's get to the story. The ghost visitor idea appealed to me, but it took forever for Herman to show up!I made it through, though -- after the first chapter, I just skimmed the rest. Finished the thing in about 2 hours that way.Won't read the rest of her stuff."
1,Hated it,You have to be kiding. Tears of bordom prevented me from finishing this. It took fifty pages for her drive to work and be shown a room. She went had too many back flashes and when the author resumed to the present I'd forgotten where we were. Too much redundant information. I don't recommend this book at all.
4,Grow Old With Me Sundial,"I purchased this sundial to give to my husband on our first anniversary since clocks are one of the gifts to give on this occasion, but I thought a sundial was more appropriate. He liked it; I liked it. He is going to make a cedar pillar for it. It was as described on the website and it was delivered promptly even though we live in the sticks and some delivery services have trouble finding us. Only criticism I have is it is somewhat smaller than I visualized. The dimensions were probably there but I failed to read them. Overall, good buy and I think it makes a great anniversary gift."
4,"Great gift, wish it came with a stand","I know they sell the stand separately, but I wish the sundial had a temporary display stand. I bought this as a wedding gift for a close friend. They loved it. Its a great design with the brass giving it a quality look and feel. It will be a bright spot in their garden for years to come (or so I hope)."
5,Stunning!,"We absolutely loved this sundial! It was perfect for a 50th anniversary gift, but would be great as a gift for any special occasion. It was nicely detailed, and easy to attach to the tree trunk base which we ordered separately."
2,the great ghost rescue,"this book was not what i thought it would be,i didn't care for it.delivered in good condition."
2,Total Let Down,"Nuno is an awesome guitarist...one of the best. You'd never know it listening to this cd. There are some cool songs, I guess, but nothing to showcase his true talent."
1,Nuno Fails Miserably with Solo Effort,"Nuno Bettencourt's ""Schizophonic"" is a total failure, and a major disappointment coming from one of the rock world's more talented guitarists. After setting a high standard for himself with Extreme, especially on the thematic album ""III Sides to Every Story"", Nuno apparently expects to ride the wave of previous success rather than to come up with new and innovative ways to express his considerable gifts."
5,WHAT WAS HE WAITING FOR?????!!!!!!!,"As a dedicated guitarist, I have listened in awwe at Nuno's flawlessness. This CD is the traditional Nuno we have all been waiting for."
5,Nuno Bettencourt Schizophonic,Excellent. I'm a huge Nuno Bettencourt fan. He's fantastic and Schizophonic is an excellent sample of his skills. Of course I have my favorite songs on the CD but I like most of his work.
5,Divine!!!,"I was pretty sad when I read in some magazine that Extreme, one of the most promising rock bands of the nineties, was history. I considered it to be a great loss to the world of rockmusic. Then by coincidence I found out that the great Nuno made a solo album named ""Schizophonic"". I tried to get it at my local CD-store, but they didn't know it and couldn't get it for me. Luckily there was Amazon. I ordered the album, just having heard a few seconds of two tracks, and boy, am I happy to have ordered the album. According to me it is way beyond excellent. Nuno did a great job, even though he very modestly shows what he is really made of. I think it's one of the greatest albums of this decade and I truly hope that there is a lot more to come."
4,Its a good survival book,"Its a very good survival book, I recommend you to read this book with the help of some other well illustrated books, this one is well illustrated too but not perfect at all. I recommend it for outdoor enthusiast, and for boy scouts. I recommend to have other books at hands specially in the venomous animals and poisonous plants as well as edible plants, this because some plants are not listed, only few, as well as some dangerous animals."
4,"Life-saving content, bad printing","This is the official military survival guide used by all US forces so its got everything you're likely to need if you get stranded in the wilderness. I used it for a guide teaching Civil Air Patrol cadets. Some of the survival lessons are aimed at in-field military (duh) but the techniques are clearly presented. Unfortunately, the print quality isn't what you might expect and several parts of the book looked like they'd run just a bit short on ink (budget cuts?). Once you get past that, though, its everything you need in a reasonable sized guide. Put it in the backpack and go. You're now reasonably assured of a safe return."
5,Things every man needs to know!,"I am in the JROTC Marine corps. and i own this book. This book is terrific on explaining things to the simple person, and it gives you the nowledge of what you need to know in certain situations. It is a very good book and i would recommend it to anyone that was serious in going into the Armed Forces, or just the average 'camper'."
2,Wasted my money,"First off, this book is dated Jan 1970 and there are no revisions listed inside the book, as to imply that it's been updated over the years. No, it's the Jan 1970 copy. And even at that, The information is so general as to be useless. For example, it says about Alligator encounters and such that one should avoid contact with large reptiles because they're likely to inflict injury. Well, no freaking duh!Wasted my money."
2,"Not very specific, not good","This is not a good survival manual. It doesn't explain some very basic and essentials well at all, people who gave this a good review are probably people with no experience. I recommend Mors Kochanski's books.Has some good info about what to do if lost in the ocean but much of it can be found online."
3,Not what I expected,One of the main reasons I purchased this book was because the first review says it has color photos of the plants. My copy does not have color photos.
2,Disappointed,The item arrived in good condition and quickly but it was not as described as far as the information it provides it left a lot to be desired.
3,"Um, You Don't Have To Pay For This.","This, like many other military manuals, is available online. Just type the FM number into your search box and a list of links to it will magically appear."
2,"Keep in mind, this book is from 1970","An... entertaining... manual, but don't read this expecting to conquer the wilderness! Some of the information is clever and useful, such as different types of shelter, navigating by the sun and stars, and a fairly extensive list of edible plants (black and white drawings only but still pretty accurate ones), but other information is very outdated, most notably some of the information on reptiles and fish. For example, treating a snakebite by cutting the skin and sucking out the poison - NOT a good idea, and will cause more tissue damage than benefit! Also, the idea that barracuda are aggressive fish that attack without warning or provocation... some of this stuff is straight out of a B-movie. Still, not a bad place to start if you're a novice and want to learn what dangers to watch for in the woods, and it's pretty cheap (free online if Google ""FM 21-76""). Experienced hikers/survivalists/etc will know to look elsewhere for more up to date and accurate info."
4,Basic Skills,"The Oct70 edition has the basic skills needed to survive for a short period of time in a well suited area; however, it is not as comprehensive as newer editions. I suggest obtaining the new CDROMs or the newest print copy (I believe it was in 93)."
3,Excellent Information and Presentation BUT Needs To Be Updated!,"This book is very interesting. I started out planning to give it a quick look and ended up reading it almost cover to cover. It contains a lot of very useful information; however, it has a 1970's copyright date and some of the information seems to be outdated. For instance, with respect to snake bites, it still recommends cutting the bite to suck out the venom and applying a tourniquet. Most authorities now indicate that these practices are not only no longer recommended but are actually now considered to be the cause of most of the serious injuries (at least from the venomous snakes in my area).With a simple update to insure that all information reflects current knowledge, I would feel comfortable giving this book 5 stars and recommending it to everyone. That said, it is still chock full of valuable and potentially life saving information and at the price, it is still a good investment."
5,All The Reviews Helpful,"The Amazon.com reviews have all been most helpful, especially the 1 October one by ""West Point"" author Norman Thomas Remick. As such, when I read through ""Survival"", I feel I am obtaining education on Wilderness Medicine important enough for a United States Army doctor to have. I believe this is an essential book for everyone. Thank you."
3,"Good, but not great :l","A good book with very useful info, but I was hoping for some color photos or something so I could better identify edible plants, etc. There are only line drawings, which makes it hard to identify the plants, etc. I think there are newer more recent editions that one could find. I plan on trying to find one."
4,a good compilation of mclauglin's best works,"I recommend this cd to anyone not familiar with mclaughlin's works. It encompasses everything from his early stuff with the revolutionary electric band, mahavishnu orchestra to his more quiet, layed back acoustic stuff. He tears it up with santana as they trade intense distorted licks on john coltrane's ""love surpreme."" Mclaughlin gets really interesting and worth hearing sounds from his guitar on ""do you hear the voices left behind"". He makes evident his scalar approach as he improvs over this bepop-sounding tune. If you want a taste Mclaughlin's extensive sophisticated style without just hearing a small period of it, this is the album. The album is both intense and relaxing with different changes in mood and style. My personal favorites are his works with the mahavishnu orchestra and ""guardian angel"" and ""aspan"" from his work with the trio on the album ""friday night live sanfrancisco"" with virtuosos al di meola and paco de lucia."
2,"ROBERT WISE, OPUS 14","Sponsored by the U.S. Senate (Senator Estes Kefauver gives us a lesson of civic spirit at the end of the film), the Captive City is a disappointment. First of all, John Forsythe seems to have one and only ONE facial expression during the whole movie. One may appreciate a few sequences that allow Robert Wise (Orson Welles' editor forCitizen Kane (70th Anniversary)) to present two actions in the same shot thanks to his perfect command of the depth of field but that's about all I have to say here. Already forgotten. Unfortunately."
2,No love but a lot of jungle,"The book starts off with a lot of promise. A bunch of Europeans fleeing for their lives in a helicopter from the ravages of African civil war. Our hero and heroine are the only two people who get left behind and so they have to make the journey out of the jungle on foot. Although the jungle surrounding is conveyed very realistically, the plot and character development never takes off. The couple's harrowing journey does come to an end. And that's when the hero disappears to reappear in the very last pages. The re-union is unconvincing since it's not known how they fell in love in the first place."
3,Good Idea,"Kind of hard to install it the way it says, but if you are a do it yourselfer you should have no problem, i had to modify it by just hanging it straight down which works perfectly."
3,"Works, just...","At our old home we just used Jack in the Box foam balls. No jack in the box balls out here, looking back I coulda bought or scrounged up something cheaper. It works, but 3 stars for cost."
2,Won't work on all doors.,"I may have something unique but this ball would be about midway on my cars (one subcompact, one medium sized SUV) if I tried to install it according to the instructions. It could be hung from the garage ceiling and would probably work OK."
4,Unexpected Fun,"New, old author of a fun romp of a story. Incognito American heiress (?) and sighingly gorgeous Prince, also incognito, falling in love and having one action-packed adventure after another. I loved it. Never heard of this author until a recent recommendation and will be reading more of George Barr McCutcheon's works."
3,Indispensible for any briefwriter,"My practice focuses on law-and-motion and appellate law. Well-written and persuasive briefs are my bread and butter. Garner's book helps me butter the bread. I have several of Bryan Garner's books (The Elements of Legal Style; A Dictionary for Modern Legal Usage; his two editions of Black's), but this is the one that has had the biggest influence on my brief writing. I received it at one of his brief-writing seminars. Since I attended the seminar and read the book, the quality of my briefs has increased exponentially. Garner guides the brief writer from the initial planning stages, through framing the issues (invaluable!), editing, punctuation, word choice, tips for impact (don't start a sentence with ""however""; use ""but,"" ""although"", or insert the ""however"" after the subject), and even technical tips about formatting (e.g. using bulleted lists.) I recommend it wholeheartedly."
5,This is a great book for modellers of all skill levels.,"I bought this book when I first started building models several years ago. The information in this text allowed me to move beyond the ""slapping the parts together"" phase and I eventually gained enough knowledge from the book to enter contests. The book gives every imagineable detail of scale aircraft construction from beginning to end. I highly recommend it to all modellers."
5,Fun on St. John,"Pam Gaffin does a great job of guiding visitors on St. John Island. We used her helpful information for hiking the trails, using the maps she included. We rented a jeep and used her tours to navigate the roads. We followed her advice and found some woderful snorkeling. It was a marvelous vacation, made better with the information she presented.Donna EckerRochester, NY"
5,"Great, fast drive","While this drive does produce a bit more noise than many 7,200RPM drives, consider that it's spinning at 10,000RPM, so more noise is to be expected I would think. And, of course, it also gets a little warmer than the normal hard drive so make sure your case has proper cooling. The rotation speed makes a difference, even a noticeable one. I saw many benchmarks attesting to this fact before purchasing the drive myself, but I knew it was worth it for myself when I saw how fast Windows loaded with this drive compared to the 7,200 RPM drive I had beforeIf you play games with long load times, move lots of files around, or just want Windows to boot up faster, this drive is worth the price."
2,I would still recommend a bigger 16 MB cache hard drive,"All you will get is a whole lotta noise, and the speed is really not all that , even when I overclocked the sucker. My other PC using a Maxtor 16 MB cache 320 GB Sata 2 hard drive does way better for the same price.Don't waste you money, for the price I paid I could have bought me a 500GB hard drive with all the partitions I ever dreamed off."
4,Good Stuff,"I saw Cat Mother and the All Night Newsboys at the Fillmore East in Greenwich Village way back when. It was a great concert and I bought the album and loved it. Loaned it to someone and never got it back. Glad to get this CD. The music is varied. Some tracks are deep, some frivilous, some spark memories, some are toe-tappers, all are good. ""Good Old Rock 'n' Roll"" can get you dancing. ""How I Spent My Summer"" brings back memories of some of my activist days. My favorite has to be ""Bramble Bush,"" a melancholy piece with the mood heightened by rain and thunderstorms. ""Track in 'A'"" is a solid instrumental. An unusual album from an unusual group. Try it, you'll like it."
1,DVD fail,"A big, fat DVD fail, for the three reasons Todd (and others) stated: releasing the edited version, making it fullscreen when it was made for widescreen, and the poor generic cover design (when they could've used the great promotional poster).Let's wait and hope for a proper release of the film sometime further down the line. Do not buy this DVD."
5,If I could give it ten stars I would,"A lot of the cartoons I loved as a kid haven't aged well. I suppose they figured that the story didn't necessarily have to make sense as long as it was fun. Eight-year-old me was entertained so it's hard to argue with the thinking.Still, shows like Batman the Animated Series elevated the quality of a lot of kids shows. Sure there will always be some garbage but overall I think the modern takes on 80s properties are huge improvements.This movie plays with that. My exposure to the modern TMNT cartoon is pretty limited but it looks pretty impressive. It also seems to take itself VERY seriously for a show about giant talking humanoid turtles. The old TMNT embraced its goofiness. They play off each other perfectly.It's like the Odd Couple but with more mutants and throwing stars."
1,Poor Release,"This is just a poor release of a very solid movie...a movie that fans enjoyed the film. But you give a movie with no features, plus it is the ""Edited"" version which is ridiculous, since the Unedited version was online for FREE. This is ridiculous and shows disrespect to the fans who poor money into this franchise (like me). Even the color is poorly done...it advertises the movie badly and is misleading, showing no signs of both the 80's cartoon versions or the black and white comic book versions (both of which are in the movie...but you wouldn't know that by the cover).This is crappy and an idiotic strategy. Paramount and Nickolodeon are off to a poor start after buying this franchise...you're not giving the fans any respect...so I give a good ole' 'piss off' for trying to make a cheap buck off of this."
1,They slap the fans in the face.,"Awful cover, Showed in 16x9, animated in 16x9, and aired in 16x9. Yet the dvd is in 4x3! Terrible, Terrible. The people who did this did not care, so as fans, we should not care either. I for one will not waste my money on this disrespectful dvd release."
2,I made a mistake with this purchase.,"Basically, I bought this on the word of a friend that said it was amazing and well done, a terrific turtle movie.My friend apparently has exceptionally low standards.I did not realize it was the finale of the newer Turtles show from 2003, which I didn't find nearly as charming or entertaining as the one I grew up with. It has the flat, over-saturated, copycat feel of Jackie Chan Adventures. I found it less entertaining to see the original turtles treated like bumbling wannabes by generic, steroidal turtles, instead of schooling the new kids.I guess if you like the newer cartoon from 2003, you will love this ... I certainly didn't."
2,Its the end of an era,This was by far one of the best films of last year & I only give it 2 stars because it's the edited version of the movie. Hopefully Nickelodeon will realize this error & release the directors cut somewhere down the road. So for now we'll have to settle for this. Despite the 8 or 9 minutes cut outta the movie it's still a great view & a most terrific finale to the TMNT 2k animated series. Another serious set back too is why the heck are there no special features on this disc? A documentary on the making of this flick or a feature about the TMNT universe or history would've been a real treat for fans. What a shame.
4,cut out?,"What part has been cut out? I want to get it, but not if the good parts have been cut out...those of you that have it already can you send me the link from youtube for what part is missing? Thanks for your help"
1,Garbage... .,"It has been said before and will be beaten to death for months, but, come on now Nickelodeon......just release the FULL F-ing version will you?I knew after the acquisition of the TMNT kingdom there would be undesirable consequences, but, I implore you, do your first release properly.Don't set the tone for years of disappointing life long Turtle worshippers.All I cay say is put this out in Full AND Wide screen, the COMPLETE 79+ minutes and add bonuses for the sake of being worth the extra cash.Live with integrity, Nickelodeon, live with honor. Don't release garbage."
4,Good Panamanian Flag,"I am panamanian and I know how the flag should be. I bought it and the colors are a 100% correct. The only minor flaw is that the seam or needlework (Not sure about the word) was made with red thread, so you can see little red lines along the edges of the flag, specially over the white and blue squares of it. That's why I gave it 4 stars. It also has 2 rings on the left side.I also uploaded some pictures.Other than that, is a good flag."
1,THIS FLAG IS INCORRECT,BLUE STAR SHOULD BE IN TOP LEFT HAND CORNERD ON A WHITE BACKGROUND-SOLID RED IN RIGHT TOP CORNER-BOTTOM LEFT SOLID BLUE-AND BOTTOM RIGHT A RED STAR ON A WHITE BACKGROUNDIT APPEARS TO BE SHOWING UPSIDE DOWN...WOW
2,The End Of The Trail,"After reading dozens of R.Howard stories,from Kull to Breckinridge Elkins I was looking foward to this collection of dramatic westerns.For some reason they just didnt hold my interest.Unlike most of his other stories these seemed very dated.I realize they are seventy years old,but Howard's other writing seems to me to be as fresh as if it was written last week.There are a couple of good stories, ""Law Shooters of Cowtown"" and ""Vultures of Wahpeton"",but mostly its like the difference between watching a western like ""Shane"", and then watching ""Hopalong Cassidy"".I did like the three ""spooky"" westerns and I thought a poem ""The Sandhills Crest"", was excellent.If you are a Howard fan,like me, you might like this just to get a taste of his western work, but if your looking for exciting western action I would probably look elsewhere."
4,Even Tom Clancy could not make up this real life story...,"I constantly had to remind myself that ""The Feathermen"" isNOT fiction. However, I'll take the word of a man who haswalked across some of the worst terrain in the world.Ranulph Fiennes is a former member of the elite Britishcommando unit, the Special Air Service (SAS). It is broughtto his attention that three members of his former unit havedied mysteriously (just think how hard it would be to kill anSASman!). Enter the Feathermen, shadowy members of agroup sworn to help out ex-SAS soldiers.Fiennes goes into great detail how the Feathermen battlea group of mercenaries called ""The Clinic"", who have beenpaid by someone to kill veterans of a long-forgotten foreignwar.Then ending is as shocking as any book of fiction, andSir Ranulph (he is a baronet), builds the suspense in a waythat you will probably lose a bit of sleep staying up readingit"
4,Liked this book a lot,2 Thumbs up. A lot of twists and turns I didn't expect. Beautiful prose and great character development as well.
3,horn replacement,"I bought this horn as an exact replacement for original equipment on my boat. The original one lasted less than two years. The outside still looked new but the sound stopped working and could not repair it. I put a plastic cover over the end when not in use, to keep moisture out. I hope this one lasts longer."
3,The playlist has COMPLETELY different songs!,"This is one CD where Amazon.com doesn't offer you the ability to sample the songs, they are simply listed in the item's description. I can tell you why that is...because the songs they typed into their description ARE, in fact, the songs that are on the CD, HOWEVER, when you put the CD on the playlist is COMPLETELY WRONG!!! For example: The first song is listed as ""Tick Tock"", but it's actually the Doodlebops theme song!! The 11th song plays ""Getting Along"", but the playlist shows it as ""When You're Good at Something"".If you search Amazon's web site, you'll find 2 audio CDs by the Doodlebops BOTH with the title ""Get On The Bus"", but each has different songs listed & the cover art is different. It's very confusing & I'm awaiting a response from Amazon on how to proceed.Get on the BusDoodlebops - Get On The Bus"
1,Doesn't Work on My PC's CD,"I have contacted themoviegiant regarding this new CD not working on my rather new Dell computer. They said it should work but gave no clues as to how. Then they said, at my expense to send it back (they could not provide a return label) and they will check the new CD for flaws. They should have refunded my money immediately and I would have gladly sent it back because it is useless to me. I will not deal with this company again."
4,Good introduction,"Mahalia Jackson is also one of those artists, who I love, even if I don't like their musical style too much. But Mahalias blend of gospel, blues and rock is irresistable. Her powerful, honest, authentic interpretation is marvellous, her voice is absolutely stunning and amazingly emotional. Combined with her exceptional personality I think her work is absolutely brilliant, and disregarding any musical styles deserves my deepest respect. I have no words to describe this wonderful music. But I can easily recommend Mahalia Jackson for any music fan who wants to hear music which enters your ears and settles in your heart. And I think this CD features a good mix of her work, and is therefore a very good introduction. But feel free to check any of her CDs, for she has much more to offer (Newport 56 live, etc.)! If you're young and you don't like this music today, keep her in mind. Perhaps in a few years you will never like to miss her again. It took me 20 years to rediscover her!"
5,Excellent gift idea.,I gave this to my oldest daughter for her birthday last year. Now I am having the hardest time thinking of a gift to give her this year. Beautiful watch. She is lucky that she never has to wind this or replace batteries. The time is accurate and the design fits her to a T. I like the Eco-Drive better that both of my fake Rolexes.
5,Perfect,"For a hip hop album, it is very hard to find one which is solid from start to finish until I listened to this. If there was such a thing as a chillout hip hop album this is it, such a smooth non-agressive style which is awesome to sit back and listen to in a dimly lit room with a goblet of Brandy (Mr Burns style).It does have its highlights, for me being Fakin Jax, Center of Attention, Microphonist Wanderlust, Grown Man Sport and No More Words. If you don't own it get it, if you have friends who haven't listened to it share it. I am glad they only made one album, as nothing InI could do after this would be good enough."
4,"Why Jip Me On ""Old San Juan?""","The original LP was a masterpiece. Why did they deliberately ommit ""Old San Juan from the CD?"" Why???????"
5,Access All Areas!,"This is a fine look back at Spyro Gyra in the early days of their recording and touring. Members Chet Catallo, Kim Stone, Eli Konikoff, Geraldo Velez, and Dave Samuels were still members of the group, and City Kids was the newest release at the time this cd was recorded live, in Florida. This reissue starts off the classic, ""shaker song,"" skipping over ""Old San Juan"", which appeared on the original album. ""Serpent In Paradise, Conversations"", and ""Morning Dance"" are highlights throughout the album. This live cd is great, just as it was when it first came out. If you like Spyro Gyra, you'll love this cd."
3,"What! ,,,,Where's Old San Juan","The original was 5 stars, but I can't believe that the definitive Sypra Gyra piece has been left off this CD. It was their concert opening number during the 80's and showed that jazz could both swing,and rock. Is there a place where this classic can be obtained? Please tell me a boxed set is in the works which will feature this lost treasure."
3,who is the brainless?,who is the brainless that didn't insert the piece Old San Juan in this CD? it was the best piece in the vinil edition
2,What a long strange trip it's been...,"The title of this book suggests that there is to be presented in these pages some new ""evidence"" to the argument that someone other than WS wrote the Shakespeare plays. But there is so little that holds water here that it is quite literally laughable. From misquoating some passages, to misinterpreting meanings of words and/or wording, and only quoating a small fraction of a famous open letter and then shading the meanings to suit her evidence, the author makes her research seem sullied. Her anti-Stratfordian bias runs rampant. If one would believe her, a glovers son couldn't write the greatest plays in history, but the son of an illiterate shoemaker could. As interesting as this book is, it leaves one with a feeling that there is no reason for this sort of hero-worshipping claptrap. Mr. Sam's or Mr Schoenbaum's Shakespeare books are much better."
1,Not the right book,"I needed a book to give an efficient overview of SQL as used with the JDBC. This book has not suited my needs. In the ""Why I Wrote This Book"" section of the Introduction, the author says ""There are many good books on SQL, but almost all focus on interactive SQL..."" As far as I know, SQL is SQL whether it is used interactively (queries entered directly by end-user) or from application code. Also, this book contains way too much Microsoft Access and Microsoft SQL Server specific SQL, not the makings for a database-independent Java application."
1,This book requires too much of Microsoft's software,"Nowhere in the description of this book does it say that you need J++ or Access, however, all the examples required them. All I wanted to do was learn SQL, not purchase J++ and Access, nor did I want to learn them. My goal (when I grew up) was to learn SQL as applied to any database, hopefully IBM DB2."
2,Not much JDBC,I found that this book does not cover the JDBC API in depth at all. It skimps over it in a couple of chapters and the remainder of the book covers Access development and SQL. I guess I was looking for more of a JDBC sepcific book.
1,Bad flick.,"As much as I liked Jennifer Garner in Alias, she couldn't save this movie. Boring, slow-moving plot. Unlikeable characters. Bad dialog. Don't waste your money."
2,What Did I Just Watch?,"I watched ""Catch And Release"" tonight and I really have no idea how I feel about it or really what I just watched. The structure of this movie is pretty much non-existent. The scenes seem forced and strung together, albeit some parts are genuine and really personable. I'm a big fan of Jennifer Garner, that is why I watched this movie and of course she didn't disappoint. Overall I feel like it was just bland and not very good."
1,Did they have to put Kevin Smith in it?,"He adds nothing to the movie except his sick jokes and terrible non existent acting. And Jennifer regretfully plays an airhead role, she is starting to turn into an Angelina Joile, and we don't want anymore trash in Hollywood, try Washington DC."
2,TRIES but is very poor,"Who doesn't LOVE Jennifer? The movie just drags on & on without explanation. LUV her reference to the boy, Matty, though. A recollection of much better movie, 13 Going on 30.Watch when you want something light, or better yet, don't."
4,Cute Chick Flick!!,Found this to be another cute chick flick that at the end you leave feeling good. Jennifer Garner is a delight. Sweet and gorgeous at the same time. One of the prettiest actresses out there. Very fresh!!! Plus her husband isn't hard to look at either!!!
2,"""Catch & Release?"" I say just let go!","Boy, am I bored. I can't think of anyone who I'd like to recommend watching this, except for some uptight teenage girls. I just finished watching it. The main plot isn't all that bad. It could have had its niche. But the director managed to make a slow-moving,lifeless piece of work which I think most viewers would find it hard to sit to the end. The only thing that got me to watch this in the beginning,like some other viewers,is Kevin Smith. I love to have a chance to see how he acts in other people's movies. But I can only say even with that, the movie is boring like hell."
2,Artwork on front is damaged,"I Love this movie and couldn't wait to own it. However, it showed up with creases and wrinkles all over the front artwork. This is the second one I received this way. The first time, I returned it because I thought the problem stemmed from the way it was packaged. Apparently, it wasn't because the replacement was in worse shape than the first. It was even difficult to get the packaging off of the item. Part of it is still sticky despite my best efforts. I own numerous DVD's and Blu-rays. I have never had a problem with any. There is just something wrong with Amazon's copies. Very disappointed in the packaging. Love the movie!"
1,Stupid and disgusting,"Anymore, ""romantic comedy"" means people acting like out-of-control animals. There was no romance in this movie, just trashy sex. My teen daughter and I quit watching after we began to see it wasn't going to get any better. What a waste of $2.99!"
4,Nice movie,"This was really a good movie. I want to say it was a "" Chick"" movie, but can't. The men in this movie were really good. And hey, you can't beat Jennifer Garner and Timothy Olephant. Grab a soda and some popcorn, and curl up on the couch with your sweetie for this one."
2,People behaving badly...,"What would YOU do, when your fiancée apparently dies just before the wedding, and you have a funeral the same day wedding flowers are being delivered? When the wedding cake is sitting in the cooler, ready to be served? And when one of your fiancee's best friends from high school is caught in a compromising position with a caterer, hired for the wedding, but now at the funeral?Whatever you can expect from this scenario (which is what you learn in the first 5 minutes of the film), the bad acting, awkward dialogue, and the weird plot twists just don't add up to make this a film worth watching.However, my spouse would give it 4 stars, she says. What gives? Good thing I am the one writing the review"""
4,Critics have been overly harsh!,"Okay, I actually agree with some of the criticism this movie has received. For one thing, I too wish we would've been introduced to Grady. Also, as great as Kevin Smith is, his ""quirkiness"" seemed a bit forced and unnatural at times. And Juliette Lewis? She's a pretty cool lady too, but I think there could've been better casting for this role.Despite this, C&R; is a really warm movie, and I think Jennifer Garner and Timothy Olyphant had GREAT onscreen chemistry; their relationship to me was believable. I think people who are giving this movie 1 or 2 stars are definitely being hypercritical- take it for what it's worth, which is strictly entertainment value.Finally, I think the music featured in this film alone should earn the movie at least a 3 star rating! The score is beautiful, and the soundtrack is equally amazing; it all falls perfectly together with each scene, shot in nowhere other than Boulder, CO."
3,"Good bits, bad bits","I don't think this movie deserves the very good or very bad reviews.I think it lacks a polished ending, some of the characters are not very well filled out (where are Gray's parents? Girl-friends?) & editing is what has killed this movie. Several scenes that possibly wound up on the cutting room floor (the original director's cut was over 3 hours) might have been better in the movie, and vice versa.I don't think the central romantic relationship is that unbelievable. Attraction is a strange thing. I also think people who say Gray wouldn't have gone for Fritz perhaps miss the point that ours AND Gray's first impression of him is supposed to be proven to be incorrect. Perhaps a couple of scenes to help us warm to him might have helped?All in all I don't think this was a disatrous movie but sadly I think it could have been so much better as the central premise is an interesting one and it had a good cast."
2,Falls Flat,"I barely made it through this movie. The story contained an endless string of awkward moments with nothing uplifting in between. Well, it tried to be uplifting in places, but fell flat. There was no drama and no successful comedy. The actors gave monotone performances and none of the characters were particularly likeable, especially Jennifer Garner's character. In my humble opinion, watching this movie was, frankly, a waste of time."
3,Eh....,I mainly wanted to see this movie because I am a huge Kevin Smith fan. I was so excited to finally see it. What a disappointment. The funniest scenes were in the previews. The ending to me was extremely cookie cutter and stale. Disappointed to say the least!
1,Flaming Pile of Narcissistic Bilge,"One of the earlier reviewers claimed this was a great date flick. Maybe.... for hyper-high maintenance dates, or future stars of Court TV's Snapped. This movie was bad, I cannot stress how bad. The story featured a bunch of early thirty-somethings doing nothing, but whining about why they couldn't be happy, lying, and doing the right thing by doing wrong. (Just a question. Is everyone this screwed-up as portrayed in this movie? Am I the odd one for not lying to my wife and slacking off at work? Guess so.) They are so self-centered and shallow that they simply become extraordinarily annoying when only twenty minutes past. The choices they make just complicate their lives with one another, so they can inflict more pain on one another. Oh well, just do yourself a huge favor and skip this waste of time. After all an hour and a half is still an hour and half, and the time you watch is time you cannot get back, ever."
2,This was a comedy??,"Wow, I really struggled with not shutting this movie off and throwing it away. I got through the movie just to see who all ends up with who because there were just nothing else to think about. I couldn't even imagine any of these situations really happening in life. Too much of a stretch for reality. Jennifer Garner is the only real reason to watch this movie and even that is a stretch."
3,Creative Attempt...,"I would definitely recommend viewing this movie prior to purchasing it. I enjoyed it for its creativity. Romantic comedies are usually very formulaic and this was a story that I had not seen before. Some of the characters were two-dimensional. The overall story kept me interested over the course of the movie. Several people I saw it with loved it, some just thought it was okay. I tend to lean more toward ""okay."" It was fun to watch, but I don't think I would purchase it for myself or as a gift. If nothing else, it there would be a couple dozen romantic comedies that I would recommend before Catch & Release, still it was an interesting story."
3,I Don't Know - It warmed on me,"At first this movie started out so depressingly real I was put off. The wedding cake in the refridgerator at the wake?? Bleh, bummed me out. After that we see Gray slowing getting past all the mourning and looking into this man she was going to marry. Its a glossy look at death recovery and love, and its not done all that great. Some of the comedy is not that funny, other times it is."
4,Loved Timothy Olyphant as Fritz,"I liked the movie. The chemistry between Jennfier Garner and Timothy Olyphant is great. I really enjoyed watching Timothy Olyphant. He looks incredibly handsome in this movie. I loved the bad/good boy image he portrayed. He is very sexy, mischievous, sweet, and vulnerable. Sometimes a player and sometimes shy. All in a hot package. The first kiss between Gray and Fritz is amazing.Although I loved watching the new couple fall in love, I do think that the scene when Gray got in Fritz's bed was a little rushed. It seemed like she was doing it to get even with her dead fiance. It looked more like rebound than falling in love. I do not feel they really got to know each other."
4,Film with depth,"Though the studio clearly had no idea how to market this delightful film, it shines amidst more lackluster and formulaic movies. It may not fit into a ""comedy"" or ""drama"" category, but the writing and acting portray greater depth - how you can laugh and cry all at once. Showing that life is more that just funny lines or easy love stories, ""Catch and Release"" offers complex characters and honesty. Beautifully done."
5,Not a big J. Garner fan...,"BUT! I love the movie. I loved the voiceovers, Garner was wonderful and I felt empathy toward her character. A really great idea and movie."
4,DVD movie,"Bought this for my daughter in law when I was visiting her. She had never seen it, It came quickly and was enjoyed."
5,awesome,never saw this movie out in theaters was really good glad i purchased it;D it was sad at first but it had a good ending.
3,sweet movie,"sweet movie, somewhat predictable, but a good movie to curl up to with your dog on a rainy day and just relax."
4,Sweet film,"Catch and Release is a sweet film. I enjoyed the interaction among the characters, expecially Grey and Fritz. And who doesn't enjoy a happy ending!"
3,Good because its different...,"No its not your typical chick flick...and thats what makes it better than most ""date"" movies...Some will complain that nothing happens during the movie...and thats true...we get no big sweeping storyline arcs...just the day to day results of a life ended too soon...Jennifer Garner is (as always) sweet and pretty and Timothy Olyphant grows on me more and more each time I see him working--a GREAT mix of sleaze with heart...I love the restraint of the director--not showing the dead fiance at all, limiting the # of locations in which the action takes place...in fact, it could easily have been done as a play on a single stage for the few number of locales it was filmed at...Good supporting actors who we also get to see try and deal with the loss of a great friend...All in all, nicely done and worth a look..."
4,A solid drama/romantic comedy movie,"I bought this movie for 2 reasons. Jennifer Garner and Kevin Smith. I'm a huge fan of the hit show Alias, and would give any movie staring Garner a try (though I must admit I was bored out of my mind with Electra). As for Kevin Smith, I'm a huge fan of his View Askew movies, and it was nice to see him doing a simple acting role in a movie with no connection to anything he wrote or comic books. He was basically ""the buddy"" in this film, but delivered one of it's most memorable performances. The story is typical romantic drama/comedy that doesn't bring anything new to the table, but the same old stuff works nicely. The only character I didn't care for was Dennis, a moody character who's purpose in the film I couldn't quite figure out. Even so, this was a definite worthwhile DVD purchase."
1,Good background noise for a nap...,"I don't even know where to begin. This movie starts slow...and just gets slower. There's very little character development, despite that being the one of the main (implied) themes of the movie. The acting isn't great and the script was lousy. Since I'm one of those people who always tries to find something nice to say, I'll mention that I loved the house. The layout was open and beautiful but it didn't really fit the mood of the movie. Garner's ""trapped-in-my-mind/trapped-in-the-situation"" attitude with the situations in the movie really didn't fit with the home she was staying in.There needed to be more action (vs. boring dialouge) in this movie. There are too many twists and turns and only a vague storyline. If you absolutely ~have~ to see this movie, borrow it, rent it, but whatever you do, ~*~don't~*~ buy it. You'll only be able to stomach the monotony once (if you're lucky)."
1,Bad guy wins the girl,"I didn't get this story at all. How can you explain that the guy that has sex with everything that has two legs, wins the girl and the long time friend that expresses his loyal, long suffering love and devotion for her, doesn't even have a chance for a date??? When she chooses the gigalo (or is that someone that gets paid for it?), I was dumbfounded and found the movie a waste of my time and values. I will give the copy I bought away for the cost of shipping, or burn it, same difference.There are still people here in America with common sense, that know the difference between love and just hot sex, that still want to enjoy a great story. This had neither."
1,Sock it to me!,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Seriously - ever. None of the characters are believable. The portrayal of Boulder, Colorado was highly exaggerated and glorified. The acting is horrible. If you like garbage, afternoon, TV-quality movies with horribly fake and ridiculous sex scenes, this is for you. This is like the ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" without the sisterhood, the traveling, and certainly without the pants."
2,"Okay, but not wonderful...........","I love Jennifer Garner, she is a great actress, and I thought this film would just be a nice sweet romantic comedy with the perfect touch of drama. It was that, but it just wasn't gripping and didnt seem to go below any surface of the film. I thought the relationship that developed between Jennifer's character and the guy she becomes involved with would have developed or been portrayed differently. Maybe the soundtrack could have been different as well, music helps bring a film together, and sadly, this one just didn't seem to flow. It was kind of predictable, but just missed something, I can't explain it, just that something that is like a nice cup of hot chocolate with just the right amt of marshmallows on a cold winters night.I'd suggest renting it first, before you make a decision to buy."
2,Mediocre,"Jennifer Garner has a smile that can light up rooms, but not even her charm can save this very mediocre movie: the plot is facile and glib, you can predict the end of the movie after the first five minutes, and the entire film suffers from a lack of definition: is this a romantic comedy? Is it a tragedy? The director seems to want to do both things and the result is a failure. I look forward to seeing Garner in a better movie than this one."
1,Catch & Release,"This movie was terrible, It did not hold my interest, there seemed to be no plot to it.. I was bored and wish I had never bought it. A total waste of my money."
1,NOT AVAILABLE for DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have tried to rent this twice and it never was sent to my unbox video player. I even tried a different movie and the other movie worked fine. I am upset with Amazon because there is no contact information to relaying that this video does not work!
4,Touching,"If you have ever lost a spouse and found out a ""secret"" they had been hiding from you, this is a good movie to see and help you understand your feelings of being betrayed and help you in your quest to trust again."
3,good movie,I'm not a fan of romcoms but I did enjoy this movie. The love story between the grieving Grey and Fritz was good and you really wanted them to end up together. Good movie to watch with your friends and a tub of ice cream
5,Catch and Release is a great movie!,Glad I bought the movie even though I've seen it on TV a dozen times.
2,Please enter a title for your review,One of the least engaging movies I've ever endured. It's hard to know how to criticize it when I can't see anything it was attempting. The biggest problems are how little of a sense you get of who the characters are to each other and the cryptic way the plot unfolds without containing any interesting mysteries. As a Kevin Smith fan I don't understand why he thought this movie was worth his time. Even his part didn't make me laugh. I'd give four stars to his commentary track that goes a fair way to redeeming the overall product though.
2,It has moments,"A friend recommended this to me and I understand why he liked it. The movie is original in some ways. It shows guys grieving for friends. It shows the community of a small group of friends. It shows humor in very a real way in tragic situations.With all that being said, the movie dragged for me. The humor is very understated and doesn't come very often. The romantic relationships are forced and very cliche in the story. None of the characters are all that likeable, although the acting is top notch for the most part.The movie just didn't work for me."
1,Was hoping for more romance.,"Is this how love and romance is in the 21st century? The scene with Jennifer Garner in a bathroom hiding in the bathtub while a friend of her dead fiancé is having sex with a woman he does not know, not knowing Jennifer is in the bathtub, was pretty shocking. I think movies like this set a terrible example for young people. I was hoping for a movie with some romance, instead this movie has people using sex as if they were eating potato chips. Plus, Jennifer's character sure didn't grieve long before she was in bed with the same guy who was in the bathroom scene.My mind is agog with the lack of respect and loose morals that both men and women display in this movie. Had I known, I would not have watched it, let alone bought it.I give it one star instead of none, because the scenery was pretty."
4,"Great Band, Great Collection","As the other reviews stated this band IS under rated. Some of my favorite 80's songs are included on this CD collection. This collection is also pretty much complete and includes all of their big hits. Today I still enjoy listening to ""All You Zombies"", ""Where Do The Children Go?"" and ""And We Danced"" now just as much as I enjoyed hearing them back in grammer school. Whenever I hear ""Satellite (my favorite Hooter's song)"" and ""Johnny B"" I think of my first girlfriend and dammit I still own the copy of ONE WAY HOME she gave me. Those were great memories. I also like the inclusion of ""Time After Time"" on this CD. Many tend to forget that Eric Bazilian and John Hyman wrote most of the songs on Cyndi Lauper's debut album SHE'S SO UNUSUAL. If you like the Hooters and if you only own Nervous Night definitely add this CD to your collection. I really liked ""Hanging On A Heartbeat"" from Nervous Night. I really think that would've been cool to include here."
5,awesome,"comes with a wall charger and car charger, light is orange/red when battery is charging, turns green when battery is done charging, works awesome! bought two for 1/4 of the price as one OEM version... I LOVE IT"
4,"1st DOA, re-shipped, 2nd works fine","Ordered this charger from SF Planet and received the charger promptly but it did not work at all (no lights came on, left in charger requisite time, battery never got warm at all.) Contacted seller by email, was told they rarely malfunction, but they shipped out another and told me not to bother doing anything about the first one. Replacement works fine. Doesn't feel too sturdy, but has held up with careful handling."
1,Item not pictured,"I have a canon rebel XT, I lost my charger some time ago and bought this one as a replacement. The on the XT battery ( at least my model )it has 3 contacts. In the photo this charger has 4 pins at the base and 2 at the top. I was sure that my XT battery would fit it some how. When the charger arrived it it only had 2 contacts for charging, and would not fit my camera battery at all. Waste of money for me, but if your battery only has two contact points you can give it a shot."
5,"Diane Poppos, nuff said",Just get it for Diane Poppos. I would look for anything with her in it and in way you get her as 2 for 1 in this mag since she does a letter column in this one
3,"Good story, but a lot of errors.","Stargate SG-1 is my favorite tv series, so when this book was released, I had to have it. While it is an interesting story, dealing with the ideas of necessary evils and standing up for what you believe is right, it has so many errors and conflicts with the series it's based on that I was nearly outraged when I finished it. If you're at all familiar with the show, many of these errors are painfully obvious, and greatly detract from the enjoyment of the book. While it is a good story, and the characters are portraied just as in the series, it could have greatly benifited from some more effort on the author's part to keep the book accurate and true to the show it was based on."
3,Little Bit of a let down,"The book started off good and grabs you into the story, but then it ends up disappointing. The biggest issue I had with this book was the ending. It was too rushed. The pace of the book was good until 2/3rds of the way in - then it just rushed to finish the story. It was like the author was under an episode time limit and had to squeeze in the necessary criteria for an episode and follow it's time schedule. It left too many things unanswered.I also didn't agree with some of the things the author did with the characters - having Daniel and Samantha inbibe in drinks just is out of character for Samantha. It's too easy to get carried away with the saracasm for O'Neill and the fact that Daniel walked away from Sha're is not believable in the least."
3,Price you pay OK,"The Price You Pay was OK for an SG1 story but not totally terrific for scifi. I didn't think there was enough challenge for the team, but, hey, I am not the author. OK for SG1 fans, but not very sci fi overall."
2,not my type,"i didnt enjoy this book, the general idea was good and tepical but there are big holes in the book that make you wonder. they did not chich if there is a dhd on the planet, they did not have radio comunications, they could not dial home but home suppose to call to know what was wrong, they made damege on that planet & and the locals may be punished by the gouald for their actions and all they did is to tell a kid to contact the nox enen the nox closed thier gate after their first engagment with sg1"
1,Could We Hire Another Author?,"Like many SG-1 fans, I was excited to see an original novel based on the series. However, Ms. McConnell seems to have some problems writing science fiction. (I've noticed that I dislike her ""Quantum Leap"" books for much the same reasons.) Not only does she need to watch the series more, in order to more accurately capture the characters and their relationships, she needs to study the series ""bible"" to figure out the science behind the Gate and various technical devices and situations.The further into the book I got, the more irritated I became; Carter's character is particularly off-base, first season or not. The plot has large holes in it, most revolving around problems following through on the science of the series; towards the end, it becomes downright illogical. I would have given this book no stars at all, but I love the series -- and the cover picture is nice.I hope we get more original novels for SG-1, but not from Ashley McConnell."
3,Could have been better.,"Once again, Ms McConnell has given us a book that is dissapointing. I really think that it is the length of the book that bother me. The book was so short-198 pages-that there is no time for development of the story. The plot is hurried along without giving us a feel for the characters. I do realise that back story on SG-1 is important, but there is a little too much. The end was rushed and the ""bad guys"" of the story seemed a little too childish and cartoonish to be scarey or believable. I hope the next one is a little longer and more in depth. Perhaps it might do the author well to actually read up on the show a little more."
4,A great first step through the Stargate!,"A thoroughly enjoyable read for any fan of SG-1 but particularly new fans. One comes away from Ashley McConnell's fast-paced story hungry for more! I love how the author brings the characters to life: O'Neill's dry sense of humor, the true love for knowledge that drives Carter and Jackson. She outlines the basics of Stargate technology, the Goa'uld, and the SGC so new fans know the score but this is artfully woven into the story making it a great read for any fan. What are you waiting for...step through the Stargate and enjoy!"
4,A good empirically-based treatment workbook,"This is a sound approach to treating panic and anxiety. The exercises are based on the clinical literature and the author's experience as a therapist. The book is in workbook format with large pages and very long lines of text across the page, which makes reading it difficult for some clients. In addition, the client has to be fairly well educated to benefit from the text. It would not be very useful to those who are not very good readers or those who have little formal education (e.g., high school dropouts with little interest in reading). Nonetheless, the ideas are useful for therapists who can incorporate them into their work without using the text per se."
5,Panic Disorder,"This book gives all the necessary information for someone to help themselves with panic disorder. The chapters are clear, the homework precise, and the lessons learned are valuable. I enjoy this writer and have purchased her hardcopy book that goes along with the workbook. Both are an excellent investment."
4,Very good,This workbook is good so far. Takes time to do the exercises and work through it so that it is effective. I'm learning a lot
5,Solid and good design,"The blade is what I expected from Gerber, a well engineered robust design. The grip is just big enough for my hands but can probably fit well enough for the avg to smaller hand as well. The blade appears of good quality and thick enough to tackle the job."
2,Buy the pill form!,"I have only used this for a few days. I have not noticed increased milk production yet, hopefully that will come. However the drops are the most vile thing I have tasted to my memory. This is probably more effective than pills, but you might actually take the pills."
2,"May work for some, but tasted horrible and didn't work for me","I followed the instructions but it tasted horrible and didn't work for me :(. I would give it another try with my next baby and see if it works then, but no luck this time."
1,Tastes like a hard shot of liquor and nasty!,"The taste is really hard to swallow but not totally unbearable. I had no increase in milk, i was really disappointed because I was hoping it would work."
2,ick.,"I purchased this Goat's Rue after reading that it was a somewhat effective treatment for PCOS. I wish I hadn't read that. It tastes absolutely VILE. It was all I could do to choke it down each day. I HAD to mix it with water, though it says not to take it with more than 2oz. (I mixed it with maybe an ounce or two.) There was really no other way to get it into my body without mixing it with water. It smells like dirt but tastes a hundred times worse.I can't really say if it worked, because after about a month I just couldn't stomach it anymore. During the time I took it, I didn't notice a change in my cycles or any noticeable change in ANYTHING at all.If you want to try it, Amazon definitely has the best price. Motherlove brand is the best from what I've heard/read, but their website charges far more for the same size."
3,DIdn't work for me,"I used this religiously for three weeks and didn't see any improvement in my milk supply. It was dwindling badly and I was trying to pump for my daughter until she was a year old. But even though I used Goat's Rue along with Breastea, I saw no improvement. A very expensive effort, but not a useful one."
3,Educational equine theraphy,"It is a nice book but I was looking on how to do the system, I think E gala is very expensive ,There are many horse trainers and horse lovers who have pasture horses they could help other with, but the price is way too high.Good infor mation on pictures in the horses mind good to know."
2,Dissapointing,"This was a good price, and I liked the idea of having a shampoo and conditioner in one, as I was hoping it would cut down on the amount of time spent having to bath my dog. She doesn't really like being washed too much, so the quicker and less stressful I can make the experience for her, the better.Unfortunately, this product left my dog's coat (she is a long haired breed) feeling rather dry. It also did not have a very strong or lasting scent - less than a day later and I could not smell the shampoo's scent on her."
1,contains parabens,I won't use paraben products on myself! My two doggies are my family I Will NOT use them on my pets either!
2,SPILLS but fast delivery!,"I have sent this item as a gift for my parents. My mom just had a surgery done and I thought it would be nice if they can at least keep the dog little more clean without draining too much energy.It was nice that it got delievered right away, but I was told from my parents that the bottle got bloated and had spills all over. So the receipts, other manual/directions, or anything in papers are all soaked with the product and not legible anymore. I read good reviews about it and may be my expectations were high but minimal they can do is to deliever it clean and new. Especially, it was for a gift to close ones to show care I would have greatly appreciated it to be delievered in a new condition."
4,smells yummy,"all natural, it smells good, my white puppy smells good, smells clean and stays white. she doesn't itch, there are no rough patches. this is good stuff. it did come quickly, however with some leakage. i would have given it 5 stars if it didn't leak in transit."
5,Great smelling shampoo,"So many of the dog shampoos we have seen in stores smell awful. This is a great smelling product and keeps her coat shiny and soft. Even though our ""puppy"" is about a year and a half now we are still using this shampoo. The bottle is still over half full and we bathe her every 2-3 weeks (she is a miniature poodle) so it lasts a long time for the money. We also bought the mango spray to keep her smelling fresh in between baths. I really like the Earthbath brand products."
4,"Love this shampoo after first use, has worked out well","Used the Earthbath Mango Tango shampoo and after one try, dogs were not itching as much and they smelled good for almost a week. I would recommend this product to anyone. They do not sell it at Petsmart anymore, so now I have to go out further into the city and get it at Petco. I enjoy bathing my two with this product and they enjoy it as well."
5,Ingredient list for those who need it,"Here is the ingredient list for the convenience of those who have many allergies as I do. (Ingredients: Purified water, extra-mild renewable coconut based cleansers, aloe vera, xanthan gum, olive oil squalene (preservative). Also cruelty free. Works great, I LOVE the stuff!"
2,not effective,The product came promptly to my home which was pleasing. I have a white boxer with very dry itchy skin. When he came out of the bath after using this product he was so red I was scared! I have not used it since. I cannot say that it helped with the itching after the fact either. I actually think he was even more irritated and itchy:(
3,"Okay, but hate the cherry scent.",Do not like the cherry scent... So would not order again because of this...otherwise seems gentle on my older dog.
3,Earthbath Puppy - just ok,"Had high expectations for this and had done my research to find a good shampoo for my two new furbabies. Arrived quickly, but during a heat wave (100 deg temps). Shampoo had been in package on (UPS) truck for 12 hours (accord to tracking info from when out for delivery to time actually arrived at our house) and bottle was not only hot, but had leaked all over inside of packaging. Initially, looked past all that, as did smell good and was anxious to try it out on my new yorkie puppies. Alas, the smell doesn't last. Bathed both pups (lathering well, etc.), towel dried, and cannot even smell the shampoo. (A part of me wonders if it being in the heat, as well as leaking may have compromised the effectiveness of product, but, who knows?!) I gave it 3 stars b/c it is a safe product (both as in ""green"" and gentle for the puppies), but had higher hopes for a pricey puppy shampoo."
4,It works,My dog seems to like it and doesn't itch as often. It smells great when applying but not much of a smell stays with the dog
5,Gentle and clean for puppies,"Recommended by my breeder, I am very pleased with this product. It cleans gently and smells good. I am going to try other some of their other products too."
3,"Very gentle, but doesn't remove doggy odor","I've been using this product on my 11mo chihuahua and 11mo whippet mix because I couldn't find much that didn't make them itch like crazy. This did solve the itching issue, but my complaint is that it doesn't help much with the dog smell. I usually bathe twice a month and leave the shampoo on for 2-3 minutes before rinsing thoroughly and they still only smell clean for a couple of days. This product is great for dogs with sensitive skin but not great if you want a clean smelling house with indoor dogs."
5,Very gentle,I purchased this fragrance-free shampoo along with one of Earthbath's scented sprays. The combination keeps my dog smelling fresh in-between groomings.
5,the most practual self defence manual,As a student of Martial Arts this book is the best yet .. it is simple and effective and will work .. For i have studed Isshin-Ryu Karate and Ninjitsu for years (10) and Master Hie Long did his best work on this book a real eye opener . He may be gone from us . but he left a piece of him to help us defend our selves ..
3,"Excellent theory, but techniques are specialized","Everyone who thinks he might ever be attacked should read this book, but only if he is prepared to do some work in applying the information to his own way of handling violence. That's because the techniques presented are highly stylized. They look to me like Chinese Kung Fu. So unless you're an active practitioner of, say, Hung Gar, you're not advised to try raising your knee to your chest and kicking someone in the armpit while trying to survive an assault.Still, the illustrations are useful if you're able to map the techniques to movements you yourself are likely to employ. It's also helpful to imagine using the information armed and unarmed, and against opponents who are either. In other words, to use this book, you have to generalize. If you have to choose only one fighting book, then this isn't it, but I'd still call it essential reading."
2,Don't buy,This book is for those people who have NO training. Very very basic book.You will get more knowledge from a black belt mag. This is how weak this book is.
1,"Doesn""t Fool Any Bug's I've found","This pet bowl advertises ""fool-a-bug"" but it doesn't fool any bugs (specifically ants) that I've found in Texas. We bought this pet bowl and paid more for freight than the bowl so my mom could feed her outside cat. It worked for the first 3 days but then the ants learned how to outsmart the bowl. So much for a bug-proof bowl. Maybe ants don't count as bugs."
1,There is a better way!,"The Fool-A-Bug was no match for California ants. Perhaps there were fewer in this bowl than a regular one, but does it matter if one finds 500 ants in the bowl rather than the usual 1000 or so?However, there is a fix! After much research (and ant filled food bowls) I finally discovered how to defeat the ants. (See photo above.) Use the Fool-A-Bug bowl as a base and buy an Anti-Ant bowlIndipets Stainless Steel Anti Ant No skid Dish, 16-Ounce. Set your old regular stainless steel dish inside the Fool-A-Bug. Then fit the Anti-Ant dish bottom into the regular pet dish. After about a year of testing, not a single California ant has made it into my device. It may look a little odd but has the added benefit of reducing strain on the kitties' necks as they eat."
3,A little bigger than I anticipated,Does it fool ants? Too early to tell but seems to be doing OK so far. My fault on the size but the cats don't seem to care.
4,great til the dog chewed it up,"Finally found something the ants wouldnt get to. Just have to make sure to keep the little feet on level ground so no part of the base can touch the ground. Worked well until the day the dog got real bored and chewed the little feet up, now it sits lopsided and the ants have more access. Guess I need to find a metal version."
2,"Sounds fine, physical features... not","The headset gives me headache, I mean literally. Not enough adjuestment. Also, I wish it had a plug-in (being-wired) feature too so that I could still listen when the juice runs out, or when there's too much white noise / interference."
1,Is this thing UL Listed? - Frayed Audio Plug Rubber Casing,"I bought this some time ago and having never had a 'wireless' headphone before I can't say whether it's very good relatively speaking. It used to work once in a while, stop, I'd have to find a frequency it would work on, not very fun all in all. But that's not the issue I have here. I can't use it any longer in any event since the wire that goes out to the device you're getting your music or tv sound through has completely become brittle and is falling away from the wire. This from a ""Panasonic"" device which was a name I associated with quality of electronics and safety of their devices. I don't have enough electrical tape to cover this up and the wire is not easily accessible to me. Great, thanks Panasonic. So if you find this or any Panasonic headphones somewhere - Beware."
5,heaven,My husband puts these on and watches his TV and listens to his music and I don't have to get the headache from it. Great buy.
2,So-so performance,"On the one hand, the headphones really do free you up; no wires, no hassles. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the quality less than spectacular. Granted, this is my one and only experience with wireless headphones, but even from 2 feet away, I experienced static, line noise and frequent interruptions. This is especially true near phones - the transmitter base actually caused my analog phone to ring. Another disadvantage is that the headphones are rather large - for the sake of comfort, the ""backbone"" of the headphones arches way up over your head. In retrospect, I think they were overpriced a tad, given the above.However, to finish the review on a good note, I really like having the volume and power switch on the phones themselves. They are comfortable to wear. They are *not* noise-canceling, or even that well insulated against outside sounds, but in general, they get the job done."
1,poor connections,I've had these headphones for a couple of weeks now and will be returning asp. They worked pretty good fgor the first week but have since been unable to keep a connection any length of time. Makes no differance whether they are on surround sound or mono. You have to constantly keep pushing a button to reconnect. Very poor quality.
3,Fair quality,"As many have said, noisy artifacts of sound. My 900 Mhz portable phone sounds better.Many have said these are comfortable, but beware! They are NOT adjustable, so if you don't have the same size head as the other reviewers, you may find loose fitting headphones annoying"
2,Cuts out A LOT,"I am writing this review after smashing this product into many pieces. The static that cut in and out didn't bother me so much. The strange noise that came in and out that sounded like someone was playing with an old radio and adjusting the frequency didn't bother me that much. What led me to smashing this product was it constantly tuning out. It would tune out, I would press the tune button, music would resume. 1 second later it would go out again. Just as I'm getting into the music and the game that I'm playing I would lose the music which was very aggrivating for me. I was pleased witht he feel of the headphones, I even liked them when they worked for me. But I need something reliable and good quality. Panasonic did not provide me with said product, so I will go elsewhere for my headphone needs or wait till a better wireless technology arises for headphones."
5,For real readers,"What sentences! ""A girl and still a girl, and not a girl at a window, nightdress loose."" Raffel wants a real reader. Even if her style is tight--Dickinson comes to mind, especially with the dashes--it continues to spring open. ""The train's report, all mineral and animal."" She's caught the sound of illness, the panic of childrearing, the clipped exchange of argument, the muteness of love. I loved it because it can be read and read, with all the hestiations in the world."
1,A (for Awful),"It was all I could do to finish this book. The writing style was choppy, which others seemed to appreciate, but it drove me crazy. I felt like I was reading a book with my son who is just learning to read. I still have yet to figure out the point of the novel. Maybe this is just not my sort of novel? but judge for yourself."
1,Complete waste of paper,"It must be people with a vested interset in seeing this book sell that are giving it good reviews, because there is nothing good about this book.I don't know what bothers me more,the money wasted buying it, or the portion of my life wasted reading it."
4,love this album,man why did'nt this come out back in the day is beyond me love the beats wish future rappers would sample these instead of hearing these wack techno beats anyway green gold is my favorite on here and you get to hear mystic voyage with vocals also roy hits you with those psychedelic vibes long live roy ayers any fan of his should cop this and volume 2 both are worthy to add to youtr collection.
3,Cracking the Vaults,"There was a reason why this stuff was vaulted. This cd is Most Definitely for the hardcore Ayers fans. Most of the tracks sound like ""Running Away"" rejects. The Cd isn't ALL bad there are a couple of good tracks on here. Now Im an Ayers(head), but I wish I didn't rush out to buy this one."
3,Queriendo hacer un fuego de las cenizas de Soda...,"Eso fue lo primero que pense una vez oi ""Ahi Vamos"", el tan esperado disco de Gustavo Cerati. Las guitarras tomaron nuevamente el control sobre su musica, y nada malo con eso, pero tengo mis reservas. Hay canciones que parecen b-sides de Soda, con riffs reciclados y el sonido de early 90's que le dio a ""Dynamo"" toda la majestuosidad e importancia que tiene en la carrera de Soda y el rock latinoamericano como tal. Pero al ser un disco tan guitar-oriented, y al tomar tanto de Soda, se torna repetitivo, y hasta aburrido a veces.Quitarle merito a Cerati como musico, es futil. Pero conociendo la grandeza de su musica, al menos yo en mi caracter personal esperaba algo que me volara la cabeza. Y no fue asi. Poco a poco le he tomado gusto al disco, pero definitivamente me ha decepcionado. Es como si Cerati hubiese querido hacer un fuego de las cenizas de Soda Stereo, pero apenas pudo encender una llama..."
3,Un Paso Atras,"Cerati es un gran artista que con su musica te cambia hasta tu estado de animo; como por ejemplo la cancion ""Beautiful"" de Bocanada. Con este album simplemente se entrega al mainstream y da un paso atras en su madurez musical con lo que suena como si fuera una banda culaquiera sin sonido distintivo. Si quieres Cerati en su maxima expresion escucha Bocanada o tal vez Siempre es Hoy( No las horribles ""Reversiones"")."
4,"Por fin, carajo","Finalmente, Cerati caza la viola una vez mas y se dedica a lo que sabe, a tocar las seis cuerdas y hacer buen rock. Nada de letras muy profundas ni nada semejante, pero buen ritmo y buenos solos (aunque un tanto escasos)."
4,"This guy is mockin david bowie's thursday's child, that my friends, sucks!","Listen , the song ""lago en el cielo"" compare the melody and the the voice how he mocking the voice of the chamelon in his song ""thursday's child"" from the album ""hours"", come on!, i know Ceratti is a good writer and composer, come on!, is this an homage? who knows?, but is a good album, buy it."
2,Le falta algo,El disco me aburrio un poco. Es como si le faltara un ingrediente. Tiene canciones buenas pero como conjunto es un poco aburrido.
4,Great rock album!,"I have always been a fan of Soda Stereo, but I've had mixed feelings about Gustavo Cerati's solo work. This album in my opinion delivers the goods. It is a pure rock album with none of that poppish nonsense. I would recommend it to anyone interested in pure rock en espanol. The whole album is great, but some of the stand-out tracks are ""Adios"", ""La Excepcion"", ""Jugo de Luna"", ""Dios Nos Libre"", and ""Crimen"""
1,Very disappointing,"The book is a good introduction to the thinking behind Use Cases and their strengths, but I find their examples drive me mad, as their texts are sometimes ambiguous / confusing / incorrect / all of the above.This, for me, defeats the whole purpose of Use Cases, if they are not logically correct ... they say in the book to use Use Cases to record the requirements, but how on earth can you design a good system according to the requirements if they are wrong and/or incomplete in places?Have stopped reading it in frustration."
4,Decent,This book does a decent job of explaining the use of Use Cases in defining/documenting requirements. My only complaint is that the authors skip around in the text. Other than that the book was well thought out.
2,Use Case Religion,"I found it hard to believe anything these guys said. They put up strawmen so they could attack other methods of gathering requirements. Their use cases had exactly the same flaws they criticized earlier in the text. The book seemed more like a sermon than a serious discussion of use cases. On the other hand, it did have lots of step by step detail on how to do use cases. I am looking for another book on use cases."
3,How to design Use Cases iteratively,"This book is a ""not so bad"" book on Use Cases. It shows clearly how the Use Cases are completed iteratively, with clearly named completion levels. The book also tackle the problem of detailed rules attached to Uses Cases as well as risk list mitigation. On the bad side, I don't like the Use Cases decomposition the authors adopt and, even if a case study is a good idea, two case studies which spend the half of the book seems too much. Another thing about the iterative approach : to oulines the difference between 2 iterations, it should be interesting to use 2 colors or at least bold characters."
5,Why are not there actually singers like her?,"To say Connie was a triumph of the nature is not exaggerate. She was by far the best female singer not Italian who sang as anyone else the music of that beloved land. Her vocal inflexions, commitment and above all the absolute involvement in every piece he performed.And despite her personal disgrace she had the spiritual courage to keep going and shine like an eternal star."
2,McGoverns analyses poor - some historical data interesting,"McGoverns analyses seem to dwell more on justifying his actions in EPA than in providing the positions of the protaganists. He sets himself up as the great neutral party but he clearly thought it was his role to determine if the Campos had proven themselves ""worthy"" of treatment as a government. This was a clear violation of the policy of ""government to government"" that the federal government had directed Mr. McGovern to follow. Some of the factual accounts and history were interesting. The California Indian history was especially interesting, but what was the relevance? It seemed that he was making the implication that the Indians were trying to put in a dump in revenge for past slights yet he puts no meat on the implication. This seems to demonstrate a prejudice he never quite overcame."
5,works Great,"I aopted an 80 pound German Sheppard that had no training, she pulls constantly to the point of giving me blishter and she acts really goofy around other dogs. So I purchased the Gentle Lead, watched the DVD, (a must) and she has practically trained herslef, with very slight correction from me. I am very sensative to any pain for ahrm with my companion animals so therefore I was a bit concerned about this lead, but after using it I feel I can recommend it as a useful tool. YOU DO NOT NEED TO PULL HARD OR DO A SHARP JERK/TUG LIKE THE PREVIOUS PERSON MENTIONED. Now we go for walk and thee is no tugging or pulling. Give it a try and I hope you have the same success."
5,new dog!,"This collar made my one year old border collie into a new dog. Not only did it completely eliminate pulling within 5 minutes of fitting, but it also calmed him to the point that he had a much easier time with training. It seems to me to be a bit like a young child. He could overpower me and so thought he was in charge and I was constantly fighting for leader position, so he was always wild and hyper. Once I started using the collar, he realized that I am in charge and calmed down. Contrary to some other posts, I feel like it did help us,to a degree, even when off leash. Back to my thought about a young child, once they know where the limits are and who is really in charge (the adult or human), they are much happier.Like the other posts, I cannot over emphasize the importance of fitting it correctly. I had one of the trainers who teaches our obedience class, and is a gentle leader user, help me fit it."
2,Nice idea but not ready for large dogs.,The concept of the collier works fine except its not ready for the power of a large dog. Our German Shepherd broke the nose strap almost the first day. So if you have a medium dog or maybe a dog that doesnt pull its for you as it does work. But not for dogs that can pull you down the street as this simple fabric cannot hold the power of our dog.
1,Dog's With a Brain Chew thru It in a Minute,"Gee, this lasted about 5 minutes before I had a completely loose dog -- merely turning her head allows for chewing through the extremely flimsy materials and plastic!CRAP!"
2,Annoying to use,"Just hated this thing from the get go. Couldn't figure it out despite the video. Just too complicated all around. And once on, didn't give the results expected. Tossed it and grabbed the halti."
1,DON'T BUY this Leader Headcollar,My dog's behavior became Very VERY POOR and she would misbehave with this Leader Headcollar. After we did away with it she changed back to her sweet self; and every once in a while wanted to chase after LOUD cars when I was walking her on a leash.
1,Not Recommended,"Long, long delay in shipping. Overpriced. Vet does not recommend. Discarded this piece of junk."
4,Great product-But sizing can be a problem,"This product works very well. It stopped my 'sled dog' shepherd from pulling against the lead the very first time it was used (She was pulling on the collar so hard that she was constantly choking, gagging, and even throwing up). The only problem I've had with the gentle leader (other than price) is getting the right size. My dog is a border line small-medium dog with an average muzzle size. The nose loop on the small tends to be too small while the collar on the medium is too big. Needs more overlap on the nose loop with the next size up. If you have a big muzzle dog you'll need to get one size bigger than indicated."
1,Go with a Canny Collar instead,"In several places, the instructions warn you not to pull sharply or you risk injury to your dog's neck. Well, even if I'm super careful, my wild and crazy dog (which is why I needed this collar) may not be. I don't want to use a lead that may injure my dog. Aside from that, the strap kept riding up into her eyes. It seems that your dog must have a blocky head (e.g., Boxer) in order for that not to happen, but my dog does not. I returned the Gentle Leader, went web-surfing and found something made in Scotland called the Canny Collar. No risk of neck injury, no strap in the eyes and, yes, no pulling! Don't waste your time or money or your dog's neck with the Gentle Leader."
5,"It gives great results, if you use it properly and consistently.","Like all great tools, this is a great tool when properly used. It increases your dog's willingness to pay attention to what you say. It is a physical reminder to your dog that you, not him/her, are in control of things. Just as with anything else, do your homework before implementing this very effective tool. Homework includes educating yourself on the principles and strategy of use, proper sizing, proper fitting, etc. And remember, there are no true shortcuts to effective dog training. It takes a balance of the right knowledge, plenty of practice, consistency, and the right tools."
5,This works!,"Even with this device, 80 pounds of young German Shepherd at the end of the leash is no joke, but the difference is night and day."
1,Disappointing,"We tried to make these work for our 2 dogs, but they just never took. They were constantly trying to claw at them and never did what the video said. We were EXTREMELY careful to follow instructions, but never got the results we were looking for. Went to a SPRENGER pinch collar with is AWESOME for our more hard-headed dog, and to a choke chain for our other less hard-headed dog. They reacted much better to these and don't treat these collars like a punishment which they treated the gentle leader as."
3,eh,"Got a collar for each of my three dogs. It does help in stopping the pulling, but the collar does not stay put very well. I watched the video and followed the instructions but the collar would still rotate and would rub close to their eyes. Individually they walk fine with it, but together they still want to pull (although not as bad as without) and it doesn't bother them to have their face tugged on. I would find a head collar with more stability and that wont rub against your dog's eyes"
3,sensitive skin,"I will first like to say that I love this collar and feel horrible about the 4 stars that I gave it.There is a reason though.If your dog, like my bulky (muscular)80lbs white Lab, has any allergies and/or skin conditions, please limit the time that used.I used it for just three days and it rubbed the bridge of his nose raw. We generally went on walks of no more than 20 minutes with this.If your pet has sensitive skin, I would say to use the collar for a short duration and then switch to the standard neck collar, alternating the two.I have also used the chest type training harness that constricts the front legs when they pull and it too caused the same condition.If your pet has no skin issues... BUY IT!"
3,Worked great....but is rubbing hair off my dog's face! :-(,"I really loved this collar - and it worked well with my year old Chocolate lab. But I noticed that where the collar lays on his face - it is rubbing his hair off! He's too cute to have a face with a mark! So, I am going to discontinue using it with the hopes that his hair on his face will grow back! I wish the nylon around the face was made a little softer. I wonder if anyone else has had this problem?"
3,Not So Gentle leader,"Somehow this thing does work - however, my dog hates it. He is a rescue, so I'm sure we have some issues there, but although it keeps him from pulling me so hard, he stops frequently to try to get it off."
2,Good...but....disappointing,"We purchased this collar for our dog who is very dog reactive. It hasn't helped with his out of control lunging, but that could just be our crazy dog. Here's the reason for the mild review...it's only been about 4 or 5 months now, and it's fraying so much that I know we'll have to get another one very soon! I would expect longer wear from the product. Disappointing."
5,Great product,"I had one before that I used on my boxer, worked great. Used it on him from puppy to about a year and after that he didn't need it anymore. My old room mate stole it and I needed it again for my fiance's labs. The large works exceptionally well for the larger/younger/square headed of about 75lbs, but I think a medium may work better for the smaller one with the pointier nose of about 55-60lbs. The Young one hates it and keeps trying to eat it, so don't leave it on your pet unattended! This one even came with the instructional video. It's a good idea to have your family watch this prior to using the gentle lead. This isn't an instant fix. It does take a few days to get them used to it, but it makes leashed walks with giant stubborn puppies so much more enjoyable for me! Great buying experience with this seller. It arrived very quickly. These cost $17 at the pet store and they never seemed to have the large in stock. Very happy! :)"
4,Depends on the dog,"One dog we had responded very well to this product, one dog was completely unphased and one didn't mind it but didn't gain much from it either. I certainly think it is far more humane than a prong collar and more than worth a try with your dog. Either way, you have to give them a bit of time and reinforce good behavior frequently at the beginning to see how your dog will respond."
4,"I love it, my boxer barely tolerates it","The gentle leader works wonders at keeping my boxer from pulling me on our walk. However, it bothers him to the point of him rubbing his face on the ground or my legs to try and get it off. It doesn't make a mark or seem to obviously physically rub him raw, but he does show that it doesn't feel good."
2,My DOG doesn't like it,This was yet another of many attempts to get my medium-sized dog to stop pulling. He absolutely hated it and refused to go anywhere. It was like an episode of crocodile hunters- he was on the ground spinning and tangling in it to get it off. The part that goes over his muzzle was irritating his skin as well. I went with another no-pull leash-- the one with the hook on the chest and one strap goes under the front legs. That one works WONDERS if you can find it. This one is too difficult to get adjusted to.
4,GENTLE LEADER,"I got one of these for each of my dogs. They work but the dogs still fight it everytime I put it on them. One even rubbed the skin off her nose trying to get it off. BUT, it does calm them down and makes them walk nicely (when they're not fighting it). Probably just need more individual work before trying to walk them both together. I'd buy them again."
5,Life Changer,"After reading the instructions carefully, my very large (100#) Goldadore and I tried out the collar. In under 3 minutes, my dog was walking calmly beside me and not dragging me down the street. I was skeptical of the testimonials, and now I have become one myself. Great product! I also bought one for my small female choc lab and had the same results, although it took a little longer... maybe 10 minutes."
2,"Kind of works, rubs the fur off","I have a 110 lb lab who is a strong puller. When I first tried the Gentle Leader on him, it took a while to get accustomed to. After the initial training period, it worked great for a few months. He has started pulling again in the recent months, bad enough to wear the fur on his nose off from the nylon. It does not seem to bother him in the least. However, we run at least 20 miles a week and it is causing unsightly scabbing. It is also riding up into his eye area since he is pulling so hard. I really don't need this kind of resistance training! I'm trying a no-pull harness now, though I think he will be too strong for it."
5,Great for large dogs,"I have a 200 pound St. Bernard. I didn't want to use a choke collar because I don't think they are very nice so I bought the gentle leader on the recommendation of a trainer. How it was described to me is that you need to use it like a horse harness, that your dog will despise it for a couple of months and buck and try to rub it off but if you are consistent then your dog will soon love it and not give you any issues. The trick I learned was to pull up when he was being bad, make your dog look at the sky because dogs hate that. And it is like magic.....he stopped doing whatever he was doing! Now I am 105 pounds when wet so it should say a lot that I now was able to train my dog to walk happily besides me with the gentle leader. Not only have I continued buying them as he grows (now in X-Large) but I recommend them to everyone who has issues walking their dog."
3,Walk your dog!,"Gentle Leader Head Collar, Size: Medium, Color: Black was purchaed and recieved quickly. I tried it on my dog, and he didnt take too kindly to it the first few times, but after or tenacity, he now is use to it and tolerates it just fine. He pulls less and is easier to walk now.It works well when we are around other dogs."
3,Works well but caused injury to my dog,"I purchased this collar for my strangely strong and headstrong Cocker Spaniel after having terrible luck with previous ones. He is 10 years old and always been impossible to walk (especially when other dogs are around). The Gentle Leader collar worked well, but was NOT gentle on my dog. It helped control him, but if he tried to go after another animal, he would pull so hard that it made his mouth bleed and his eyes would become swollen.I ended up going with the easy Walk Harness (same company, I think). It has been much better."
5,Best purchase ever!,"I have two dogs in NYC and these were a life changer. Not only do they help correct pulling, but they making eating stuff off the street much more difficult. The small is big I have it for both my 16 lb Yorkie and 23 lb puggle and both have room. This gentle leader was a replacement for one purchased about 4 years ago. The dogs obviously werent thrilled about the leader at first but got used to them in just a few days. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would."
5,My Golden Retreiver hates this and I LOVE THAT!,She has an awful habit of wanting to pull and I've been uncertain of how to handle that. Plus she gets super excited when she meet new people or animals and doesn't know how to listen when they arrive at first. When this is on she hates how it pulls her nose to the side so much that she doesn't want to do any of the things that she usually does and she is starting to look at me to give her the sign that I feel she has settle enough for me to remove it. THAT'S GREAT!
3,"Little hard to get on, but works great once you do","Would definitely recommend four training to walk your dog, after you train him to let me you put it on :-)"
5,AMAZING for beagle mix,"I have a 5 month old Beagle mixed w/ black and tan coonhound and a sheepdog. She had become a nightmare to walk dragging me all over the neighborhood on our morning walks. A man at the local petstore suggested I try this and what a difference! I put this on my dog in the house before trying it out just to let her get used to it. She HATED IT and tried rubbing it off and rolling her nose against the floor to move it, but after enticing her with some treats and letting her get used to it she forgot it was on. On just our first walk it made such a difference. After just two or three gentle tugs on the leash she learned her lesson. She now walks ""loose leash"" on my right side with no hassle or pulling. AMAZING. I highly recommend this to anyone with a stubborn dog that is disobedient or pulls on the leash!"
5,Buy One,"Before I had this, my monster of a German Shepard could drag me through an alley. This product not only trains your dog, but helps with wear and tear on your face!"
4,"I like it, my dog hated it","My dog is instantly submissive with this collar, BUT, he stops every few minutes and tries his best to get it off. I only use it now when I know there will be a lot of other dogs out during our walks. I'm sure if I work with him more he will eventually give in to the collar and stop trying to remove it."
5,Love the GL!!!,This product arrived so fast. Fits my dog perfectly. I love the Gentle Leader!! It's made walking a 90 pound dog such a breeze. Definitely recommend the product and the seller!!!
2,Problems outweigh benefits,"This collar hurt my dog more than it helped him. I tried it with the neck very tight & nose strap loose enough to go to the nose but not over. My puppy wheezed, the collar didn't stay up high behind his ears (with just 1 finger room), and the nose strap kept sliding up to his eyes & cutting him under the eyes.So the trainer adjusted the collar to be looser & the nose strap to be tighter. So now there was no wheezing, but the tighter nose strap just made it cut him more sharply under the eyes and slide up over his eyes more easily which drives him crazy (understandably). He now has bald spots under his eyes & is always rubbing them.My dog's a lab puppy, normal sized, but the control this collar gives isn't worth harming my dog. Going to try the haltie (sp?) collar or something else. So be warned - it does help keep your dog from pulling, but it might not be worth it."
2,Dog Head Collar,Completely unsatisfied with this product. The product did not work as advertise. It might work for some dogs but I have a Boston Terrier which have short snouts and the product does not work at all for this type dog. I would check and double check before buying this type product again.
1,Terribly Cruel way to train a dog!,I found this a terribly cruel way to train a dog. Dog can't breathe when pulling on this harness. I would NEVER use it continually on any dog I owned. Use a regular harness and work with your dog instead of using a gimmick like this.
1,Dog chewed it off after first use!,It said in instructions that it can be left on but as soon as I left my 7 month old dog with it he chewed it right off. I had fitted it tightly but it has straps that just hang which he was able to reach. Needs redesigning.A call to customer service resulteed in a very curt reply from a woman who informed me that a dog could chew almost anything and offered a replacement for another $7.95. Why would they tell you it can be left on permanently?? I guess to get another $7.95. NO THANKS!!
5,Wonderful,"I love this product. We adopted a 3 year old 90 pound lab from the SPCA. Bella is the most loving and attentive dog imaginable, until we went on our walks. My neighbor recommend this product because it stopped her lab from pulling. The difference in Bella during our walks now is was nothing less than a miracle. Before it took all my strength to walk her, now with the collar on, my 8 year old walks her (with me by her side of course). Even when our dog caught site of a cat running across the road,my daughter was not dragged behind the dog. As soon as Bella jumped to give chase, the head collar stopped her forward motion.Bella even gets excited when I pick up the Gentle Leader, because she knows it is time to for her walk. The only down side I see is that casual observers think it is a muzzle, but I quickly correct them."
5,great product !,Wow !! I have a very big and strong 8 month old black lab who liked to pull on her leash. We tried many different products and techniques. Nothing had worked.... Until now ! The first time we used the gentle leader collar it worked like a charm ! We watched the video and offered treats and distracted her with her favorite toy each time she started pawing at the collar. It didn't take too long before she was walking and happily exploring the yard (without breaking my arm !!) A great product and I would reccomend watching the video before using it.
3,Wouldn't recommend for bulldogs/pitbulls,"The product does what it claims, gives you more control when walking your dog. The DVD is very helpful and informative. Wasn't a good product for my dog (Beagle/Endlish Bulldog mix) b/c all over the video it warns that the product could impair your dog's breathing passageway, which in my mind is quite a risk. My dog also would repeatedly lay down on the ground and stick his nose in the snow, scratch his snout etc--the dvd tells you not to pull with the gentle leader, leaving me powerless with my dog miserable and limp on the ground. I tried with treats and it didn't work for us. Might work for others but wouldn't recommend for dog owners who have boxer, bulldogs etc as this may impair their breathing. We had more success with yuppie puppy's no pull harness."
4,Great -But sizing can be a problem,This product works very well. It stopped my 'sled dog' shepherd from pulling me around the very first time it was used. The only problem I've had with it is getting the right size. My dog is a border line small-medium average muzzle dog. The nose loop on the small tends to be too small while the collar on the medium is too big. Needs more overlap on the nose loop with the next size up. If you have a big muzzle dog you'll need to get one size bigger than indicated.
5,Its like we've been walking for years!!!,"Our beagle has no home training and it's our fault. We've had him for two years now and we just let him out into the backyard to play. We didn't walk him. When we did try to walk him, he walked us. This leash is amazing. I put it on him. He didn't fight. He understood what to do right away. We walk our dog today like we have been walking him for years. Amazing!!!"
5,Great tool,"My wife and I are very impressed with this leader. We have a large Labradoodle and this collar controls our dog far better than the neck collar or harness that we've used before. While our dog is somewhat hesitant when she knows we're going to put it on her, once on it doesn't seem to cause her any discomfort. Highly recommended."
5,Godsend!,This gentle leader has been an absolute godsend. We got it for our five month old male German Shepherd. He was definitely a puller. He would pull my 12-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son whenever they would try to walk him. It was to the point where it was very unpleasant to try to walk him. After reading the high reviews and watching several videos on different types of head leaders we decided to go with the gentle leader. We are very pleased with this purchase. It only took our German Shepherd about a day to get used to it. The difference is like night and day. He never pulls now... it is so much more fun to walk him as he gently walks by your side.
3,Great for making your dog walk well but not without problems,"This halter made my dog who formerly pulled like crazy a pleasure to walk! The first day he had some issues getting used to it but he adjusted soon enough. After two days using it I noticed some fur less patches wear the halter went under his eyes, where it had rubbed the hair off. It hadn't been left on all day only for a few hours each day and still had noticeably caused irritation, my dog even got a pimple like irritation bump. Despite the problem I kept using it, keeping it on him ONLY when we were walking him and taking it off immediately after since it was the only way I could walk him.After having it only a month the nose adjuster fell off, making it completely useless!Although it fixes the walking problems I have to say its not worth the money and does cause irritation and isn't good quality. I would suggest a head halter, just not this one!"
5,LOVE IT!,"I have a very animal aggressive, 130 lb Great Dane, this head collar fit her perfectly, and it is much easier to control and train her with it than with a normal collar. I would definitely reccomend it to anyone."
4,Good training tool,"Bought this for my 45 pound pitbull mix because she pulled a lot during walks. She doesn't really enjoy the collar but once she starts walking she forgets about it. Works pretty well, stops her from pulling all together, she couldn't pull now if she tried. It just pulls her head down and she stops. Good collar."
5,Works suprisigly well.,"I was honestly surprised at how quickly this collar reduces pulling behaviors. The first walk was a bit of a struggle as my dog kept trying to pull it off of her face. But now, 2 weeks later, she sits still while I put it on and walks right by my side, needing only a very gentle pull to keep her on track."
5,Gentle Leader ... Extremely Effective!!,"My young dog (Standard Schnauzer) has loads of energy and all of my other leads have been relatively ineffective in channeling that energy during walks and jogs. (I am really not interested in inflicting pain to slow him down.) This Premier Gentle Leader Head Collar for Dogs did the trick; he is gently reoriented and under gentle but firm control. I can now ride next to him on my bike with this leader as my only control. When my dog sees me get this leader out, he comes bounding to get it on and go out for our ""bike run"". I attach a 5-foot GenuineDogGear braided snap leash to the Gentle Leader as the perfect shock-absorbing match for biking with my dog. I will be buying another set of this gear because I never want to be without this combination for this or any other dog I own. Be sure to study and follow the explicit directions about how to get this collar adjusted properly and about how to use it; otherwise it won't work so effectively."
3,not for all dogs,"This didn't work for my dog. She wouldn't keep this on, kept pulling it off, as if she couldn't stand thestrap around her snout. I think this is one of those ideas that seemed good on paper not not in reality."
2,Oshea,"Did not work for our dog. Lab puppy 5 months old. I am sure it works for other dogs as noted, but our dog, NO WAY. We later used a body harness. Worked much better and she walks just fine on this."
5,Love these gentle leaders,"I had to buy the med size for my puggle's 27 lb weight . I love the way she obeys and walks with it. My wife doesn't like the way it looks like a muzzle, but I don't think it does. I think it looks great and I really like the way our dog behaves with other dogs, kids and other distractions around. Great buy and I'd do it again."
5,This thing works,"I have a 150 pound Great Pyrenees, 70 pound Husky, 55 pound Samoyed.I bought this thing for all of them (but ofcourse in different sizes)I had to buy 2 extra because my samoyed chewed it up when i was away.It is not the fault of the product but FYI, it is not gonna last long in the mouth of a samoyed.However, This thing really works. I can walk all three of them without much pulling from them all."
5,So far: Walking Nirvana!,"We just got this for our 2 yr old lab/heeler mix. She's a great dog, but I guess we are not great trainers, because we just couldn't get the knack of teaching her not to pull on the leash. The first time we put the Gentle Leader on, she rubbed her snout on the ground a few times during the walk, but it was like walking a whole new dog. The leash was slack about 90% of the time, and as soon as there was even the slightest tension, our dog immediately slowed down on her own. There was absolutely no need to pull on the leash, encourage her to slow down, or struggle through the walk at all. We brought some treats along for positive reinforcement, and our 6-yr old walked the dog the last few yards to our house.We'll be sure to keep up with proper training, but it's great to have a tool that will help us make that happen!"
2,a waste for me,Everyone raved over this leader but I have not been able to get it adjusted to what the video says. Never used it because I can't get it on. I managed to get it on once and the dog pulled right out of it. I would not recommend this for a young dog but maybe an adult dog would do better
2,Durability is an issue,"I purchased this collar for a one-year-old lab mix. He is approx 70 lbs of puppy on the end of a leash, and I think he has aspirations to become a sled dog. He is part bulldog, and has a lot of muscle strength in his chest. He is easily able to walk us on a regular collar. The gentle leader collar made a huge difference with the pulling, and I have recommended this product to several friends. However, we have only had the dog for three months, and he just chewed through the nose band of his second gentle leader. Both times, the damage occurred literally in a matter of seconds. I had let him off the leash to assist one of the children, and by the time I turned around to reattach the leash, this collar was hanging in pieces. I really like this product, but I'm very disappointed with the quality in construction."
5,I Can Walk My Dog Now,"I have a very head strong medium size dog who pulled endlessly on the leash, choking, making terrible nosies and hurting my arm. I really don't know how to train dogs either, but I love them. My vet's wife suggested this lead and it makes all the difference in the world. I can't say as my dog loves it (he didn't like the leash either), but he gets to go out and we have fun as a result of using it. It does not hurt him. He can't pull me, so my arm and shoulder don't hurt and he gets to go out much more often, since it's a pleasure for me instead of a fight and a chore. I don't know why the ""animal trainer"" said this was a cruelty -- he doesn't seem to suffer at all -- he just doesn't get to yank me around. If you don't take your dog out because he pulls, this is the answer for you. So I give it 5 stars."
5,Gentle Leader Dog Collar,"Great product. Really helps my dogs behave when walking through the neighborhood, especially when other dogs are around. Bye Bye"
5,Great tool for dogs,"Check the sizing to get the proper fit, but beyond that it is a great tool for stubborn puppies. Most people will feel bad when they use it, because they will usually fight the first walk. They will plant their butt and throw a tantrum. This is just them getting over the fact they are losing control. Walk through it. It is just cloth, not metal prongs. It takes a little time for them to get used to it. My dog is almost 3 now so I rarely use it, but if we are out in a high stress, social situation where he feels he has to defend us from other dominant dogs. I can put it on and he'll instantly become submissive. It's very convenient for pushy, dominant dogs. It is only for walks and is not for leaving on around the house, they will get it off."
5,Lifesaver,"I bought this because my huge german shepherd drags me down the street. It was so bad, and she was so impossible to get under control that I just gave up on walks. I had known of people who bought the Gentle Leader to control barking, but I did not know it could help with training. It is incredible! The first time I walked her with the Gentle Leader, she tried to drag me for half a block, and then gave up and walked next to me (BY MY SIDE) without tugging the entire way. When we got home, I jumped up and down and hugged the crap out of her. I bought the Signature K9 Double Handle Braided Leather Leash (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CXIXN6) with it, which I also give tons of praise."
1,Gentle leader,"I received the gentle leader in late April, and the plastic part of the product broke in less than three weeks!"
1,Poor fit hurts dog,"I have two dogs, one a 50 lb. lab mix, the other a 35 lb. shepherd mix. Both of whom pull; the shepherd mix pulls terribly. At first the collars worked great. I put it on, instantly no pulling. However, after a couple minutes the dogs would begin clawing at their faces, causing one to bleed within seconds in desperation to try to get it off. The lab mix would do ok, occasionally clawing but not hurting himself. If the collar would stay put exactly where it is supposed to be, it may be better. However, the collar will slide down the neck even at the recommended tightness. The buckle/tightening portion of the collar is not so good and after a minute or so of walking will begin to loosen, thus causing the repositioning of the collar and making it harmful to the dog. If making it tighter, the collar will press in on the bottoms of the eyes of the dog, causing obvious discomfort. Be prepared to return the item if you get it."
1,Disappointing,"The leader did not work with my strong nine month old puppies. Despite following the instructions carefully, they writhed at the end of the leash like a snake the entire walk, stopping only to scrub their nose against my leg or the ground. After numerous attempts, their leash behavior actually grew worse. I would not recommend this product."
4,Sure,Havent really used the Gental Leader a lot because I tried it twice and both times my dog jumped around trying to take it off her face. So I think I'll try a few more times introducing it on our walks.
3,Gentel leader,"I give this leader a 3 star because I thought it would work on my Husky. The leader didn't work to well because I think it's a little small even though it's say's "" Large "" . My male Husky's about 80 pounds . This leader would fine for dog's 50 pounds or smaller."
1,Not so Gentle Leader,"We took in an 8 month old rescue dog. He is a Husky/Pit bull mix. Great dog but his chase drive is unbelievable. Probably because his previous owner allowed him to chase the cats around his house.he had absolutely no training before I got him and after our walks my arm would be sore from his constant pulling.After reading all the good reviews I purchased the ""Gentle"" leader.I watched the video and was very careful to adjust it properly.It worked great. On our first walk he walked right with me with very little pulling.After the walk I noticed a slight abrasion on his muzzle and figured I needed to adjust it further.After the second walk his muzzle was raw and bleeding.It did ""work well"" as I had complete control of him but the price he paid in fur and flesh was too high.I threw this piece of garbage away. I would not recommend this to ANYONE!!!If you love your dog do NOT buy the not so ""gentle"" leader."
4,works great,This product works pretty well for my high energy dog. I take her running next to my bike and she doesn't pull nearly as much.
5,Best thing I ever bought!,"My dog used to drag me down the street. Now that I'm using the Gentle Leader he stays right by my side with no more pulling. It worked from the minute I put it on him. Just make sure you watch the DVD to get the fit right. I'm so glad I bought it, definitely worth the money."
3,my dog hates it,"my dog is pretty tolerant of apparatuses, including various halters, a choke collar, and backpacks. The Gentle Leader is the only product that I absolutely cannot use with her. She rolls around on the ground about every 3 minutes when I try to walk her. The only reasons I'm not giving it 1 star is that I know other people who use it with success, it's well-made and well-designed."
5,MY rottie loves it.,"This is the best leach ever. It so much easier to hand a 70lb rottie. Our rottie tries to eat everthing on the ground, with this leach a gently tug an he stops rite away."
5,EVERYONE MUST HAVE ONE OF THESE!,"If you're on the fence at all...this is a must have. It is a miracle. I have a 50 lb. pit bull who pulled so hard with a harness, all kinds of collars, that it hurt me and was becoming a liability...he's a strong puppy! This makes him a dream to walk. He walks on a loose leash and I could hold him with one finger if I wanted to. If he acts up in the house, we put this on him and it calms him. This is a wonderful product, doesn't hurt the dog or the person. My mom always had them for our German Shepherds growing up. I think everyone who owns a dog should own a Gentle Leader. Absolutely a MIRACLE product."
4,Works like a charm,Great on our Great Danes. Wish it came in more colors though so we could have a specific color for each dog as it's important to get the fit right on the Gentle Leads and having to resize for each dog isn't pratical. We have it in blue and in red.
3,not durable for large pulling dogs,"went through 3 of these before contacting the company. i finally got the reflective harness which is more durable than these. my german wire hair has not destroyed the reflective one. it seems must sturdier. the other harnesses all ripped at the same place, near the d-ring. he is a puller, he's a bird dog, so naturally its an issue walking him. BUT i expect the harnesses to be more durable than these were."
2,Use occasionally,"The vet suggested this leash because the normal leash was making her cough worse. The gentle leader definitely made my hyper 30lb dog easier to slow down, but it didn't stop her from constantly pulling constantly after seeing a squirrel, dog, human, leaf, etc. She pulled so much that it fur under her eyes was rubbed/torn off. I will still be using this collar occasionally, but I am switching to a harness for normal everyday walks.UPDATE: I still use this harness occasionally, but only as punishment. She really hates this lease, and become overly subdued/depressed when she has to put this leash on. Yes she walks right next to me, but I only keep the lease on for 5 minutes or less."
5,Good Stuff to Try,A nutritionist recommended this book to me because I have arthritis. I found some of the suggestions about arthritis and other conditions useful. The book is easy to read and sounds like my grandmother.
4,Great for Resource,"Great addition for your reference library. I've been reading the Graedon's columns for years and have always found helpful information from them. I would not use this book totally by itself, but use it to live a better, healthier life."
5,Handy Guide,"Every household should have this for their first go-to for minor common problems. It could save you money and unnecessary trips to the doctor. I gave one to all my adult children for Christmas. It's very interesting reading and the authors are well qualified authorities on the subject. They include remedies that have worked for people even though nobody knows why. They also cover the possible side effects of certain herbs and their incompatibility with certain drugs. I consider this little book our ""health bible"" and it's certainly worth the money."
5,Easy Christmas gift,"I loved the book even gave one as a Christmas gift, That person is still raving about it! It was very easy, no parking space to fine, low prices, delivered right to my home nice will do it again"
2,Way to slow!!!!,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Also, this is the only time somone has had to actually force me to read! It takes Steinbeck a page to describe how an ant walked across the road!"
4,"School Project, Great Intelectual Story","We had to read this book for a 8th grade language arts assignment and most of us loved the book and the movie. Although John Steinbecks style of writing is often hard to follow, it always draws you in and keeps you stuck in the book."
5,A hard to put down book about human greed.,"The Pearl devours anybook ever written. With its shine of human greed and human discipline it is uncomparable to any book ever written. With its wild twists and roller coaster climaxes, it is hard to put down. John Steinbeck goes where know writer has gone before, into the mind of a greedy man. Kino, an Indian man, (main character) finds a pearl one day. This is no ordinary pearl, but the Pearl of the world. From there, you see an ordianary man, who loves his family and friends, give it all up to make him self richer. Through the selling of the peal he dreams of how happy he will become. His son will become educated, he will buy material things for his wife and himself. However, this is no ordinary pearl that can be sold so easily. Watch as Kino gives up his life, dignity, and character to purchase happiness. A result that will shock and amaze the reader is instore if you pick up this book."
2,A story that made us think!,"""The Pearl"" is about the differences between rich and poor, envy and to believe that the things you haven't got is better than what you allready have got. The story is good, it makes you think, specially about fighting for something you got the right to even if others make it hard for you. It also made us think of that we not always get what we except.Things that seem good can be bad because of peoples stupidity. Wealth is not the same as happiness. The feelings the story gives you are very good, but while you read, it is quite boring because the language is so easy. Somebody may like may John Steinbeck way of writing, but we don't. The book was not a challenge to read and it didn't actually give us much excitement and feelings, but the story made us think."
3,"The Pearl is a useful book, we recommend it.",We think that what John Steinbeck wants us to understand is that you do not need money to become happy. We think he want us not to underestimate the poor or the blacks. The moral of this story is what money can do to you and your family. People often get affected by for example a Pearl`s value and that they can gets a lot of money for it. We belive that John Steinbeck think of it as a relationship with a lot of joy and happiness and that we all should be friends.
2,A book for beginners!!,"If you have read many books before, do not read this book. This book is a book for beginners!! The author, John Steinbeck, described and compared the Indians and the ""rich"" people in an emotional way. But this is not enough. The story is very simple, but on the other hand this makes the book easy to read and understand. The simplified verson of ""The Pearl"" we have read, is most suitable for people who are to learn the english tounge.We recommend this book for ""english-learning"" students all over the world."
2,Simple and boring story: The Pearl by John Steinbeck,"From the first page in this story, you know what the following pages is about. But anyway it was something which kept us reading on. There are some climaxes in the story - week climaxes. You do not get into the caracters minds enough to really know them. The moral in this story, is something which all people can relate to - even if you are poor or rich. The theme is important,and the book could be very interesting if the authour had written the story more exciting. To conclude the review: The Pearl is a book for people who want a simple story, with not much excitement."
2,"If you have a lot of spare time, read this book.","This book is about poor people, greed, rich man taking advantages of the indians, happiness of rich people, mayby racism. This story takes place in Mexico, and the main characteres are two indians; one man and his wife. They find a big, beautiful pearl and they'll try to get rich by selling it, and they face trouble on their way.The good sides: The book I very easy to read, it shows how greed can change a person, and it has a good moral...The bad sides: It is soooo predictable, soooo boring, and there are no real action.If you have a very boooring summer-holliday, you can read it. We don't recomend it at all. Don't read it."
1,A big mess,"Doesn't exist any Return to Forever Romantic Warrior of DDBB. What it's shown in the catalogue picture is This is jazz vol.30, a very good collection of the first period of DDBB music, but Return to Forever is music recorded by the Romantic Warrior of Chick Corea in the '70. So for two times I received a cd with the front cover and the disc of the Romantic Warrior and the back cover of This is jazz vol.30 of the DDBB. It's supposed I will be refund but what I wanted was the DDBB record and I'm still without. Please change the catalogue or other customers will have my (and your) same problem."
2,Somewhat lacking,"This book isn't bad if you consider how thin and cheap it is. It sacrifices completeness, emphasizing learning in a short time ""what you'd be most likely to use."" It completly omits using ""tu"", claiming that one only essentially needs ""ustedes"" (a bit annoying). Overall, it does serve its stated purpose of serving those with limited learning time."
1,"Concise, but lacking one thing...","This book is a nice reference tool, however, it lacks one important thing. Tu. The familiar ""you"". I don't know how this book discounts such an important thing. If I were Dover Pubs., I'd make an updated version including tu. As a former high school Spanish student that wanted some review before traveling to South America, this book disappointed. If you are looking to travel to Brazil or learn a little bit about Portuguese, the ""Essential Portuguese Grammar"" by DaPrista is an excellent reference covering most bases."
3,Scott Stokely Disk Golf DVD #2,"There are some helpful hints, but it lacks video quality and is too short. Also the price is a bit high."
5,What Do You Stand For?,"This is an exceptionally well written book. The author explains ethics in such a way that children can truly grasp the meaning. Each section contains a story about character in action, character dilmmas, activities, and additional resources on the topic. I highly recommend this to all parents."
4,Must see,"This is a fast paced well written comedy that was featured at the Palm Springs International Film festival 2 years ago/ I don't have a clue as to why this movie was not released in theaters, but it is definitely worth watching. The plot revolves around a n'er do well father, estranged from his grown son, whom he asks to accompanying him on a road trip. The ensuing events are hilarious and sometimes poignant. The characters are believable and the acting is superb. Well worth your time."
2,Boring and Annoying -,"A terminally-ill con man and his estranged son cross the U.S. on $5/day - objective is to reach specialized treatment. The plot is old, the acting thin, and their constant conning others becomes quite annoying. This movie is not recommended for anyone."
3,It was different,My husband loved this movie. Since we both have a somewhat warped sense of humor we enjoyed it. Christopher Walken is the best.
2,"ho hum, better than a sleeping pill.","I am only reviewing this movie because someone might waste their time watching it based on the previous reviews. Watch the trailer first if you are entertained by that well OK see the movie.Old and tired script weak comedy slow and borring all the way, TV movie fare."
3,Disc 1 is very good,"I would have liked to have something more for the money. The sound quality, overall, is lacking. It seems as if this set was put together just to cash in on Tosh's name. The Honorary Citizen original song is beyond awful.The live disc is disjointed. The quality here - as we've seen on other releases - should have been much better.Truthfully, the militant Tosh comes out far too much here and maybe that is why I give the lukewarm review. I like the sound of disc one and despite the militant feel it is ok.What to like about the first disc: Here Comes the Sun - outstanding, Legalize It Version - cool dub version, Dracula (Vampire Version) - I do love this song.If you're new to Tosh and want to get the best introduction try Legalize It. That was one of my first Peter Tosh purchases and I loved everything about it."
3,"I only listen to the first disc,",My set is defective. The glue that holds the plastic cd holders to the cardboard box came undone a few weeks after I got it. The sound quality on all three cds sounds lousy and the volume has to be turned up to hear it at a regular level. The first Early Singles disc is awesome. I got my set when it first came out like 5 years ago so they may have fixed the quality problems since then. Too expensive for what you get.
4,they work well,I purchased a set of these and a set of wood ones. These are more stable. THey have really helped me organize my drawers to keep underwear/socks/tshirts and all my running clothes (shorts/tops/socks) organized. I'm definitely ordering more to finish the rest of my drawers
4,love it! no more sloppy drawers..,"I bought some of these for my baby's drawers. Her clothes are so small that after searching for a particular item, clothes would be all over the place! These keep sections organized, so its neat and easy to find what you are looking for. I wouldn't use it for my clothes, but it is really good for baby stuff! I only gave it 4 stars since I think it's pricer than it should be. However, amazon actually has it cheaper than stores. It's very easy to install, no hardware, just spring into place. It comes with optional stickers to hold the drawers in place even more, but they are not needed. I didn't bother with the stickers and actually like that I can slide it anytime I want to adjust the size of the sections. It's simple, but I love it! Very useful!"
3,drawer organizers,"I'm keeping these and am using them but could not use them in the originally intended drawers because the sides of the drawer were not perfectly straight, and these organizers require a straight surface on which to brace. They are also too short for many of my drawers. Still, where they work, they work."
1,Won't work on drawer.,"Drawer Organizer My drawer is 18"" wide,so loose it won't stay put.If your drawer is 18"" don't buy .sorry."
1,Awful product,"I'm really kind of pissed because I just bought these and 1. they don't fit my dresser, which is in fact 12"" deep, and 2. it BROKE when I tried to push it together. Not only that, this thing is loaded with a giant spring, and one of the shards is still embedded in my carpet somewhere and I nearly injured myself in the process. So, in short, I do not recommend this product because it sucks."
3,Pretty Neat,"This toy is pretty neat and for the price it is worth it. But make sure you pay attention to the age, it is for 8 and up. It is a good toy but not great. Some of the designs are hard to figure out. This would be something I would take if you are taking your child to a boring place where he or she is going to have to wait. Or if you have an autistic child this would be something that they would like."
2,ok,buy the origional mag blocks. this product is not as fun. My son is over the triangles and needs some squares or rectangles. Just buy the mag blocks.
3,Do not leave your windows down when parking unattended,"I found no benefits at all after installing these deflectors.Originally I hoped I could leave a gap open while driving in a hot summer day. I did not feel any difference in terms of air flow and interior temperature improvement when doing so. It is still noisy if you leave the windows open partially. Rain still coming in when in the window open in any meaningful way.CON:My wife left the windows down just a little bit in a hot summer day hoping hot air could escape when parking under the sun. When she returned the rear driver side deflector was missing.As much as it advertised it is machined by computer, you can see the double-tape showing under two of the window channels.PRO:Since they are installed in the window channels with ""hidden"" double tape, there would be no unsightly tape residue when the deflectors are stolen.Easy to install and as such easy get stolen if you leave a gap open to let hot air out in the summer."
2,A movie that could have been saved!,"Honestly, I'm not really sure what type of review I could give this movie! I mean the hard rock in background music was okay, and it has some pretty good action scenes to it! I really rented it because I wanted to see Helen Slater in it! I did get my fair share with Helen playing the Mary, the dim-witted flight attendant! I liked the scene with her and Russel Crowe debating who's the better ""Star Trek"" Captain! Crowe liking Kirk (of coarse), and Slater adoring Picard! But honestly the movie was a bit loud and story undeveloped (especially the ending)! Crowe did some fair share with his role of Zack Grant, but if Mel Gibson was cast in the role, that would have given the character some style and justice to his part! In all honesty, and not to offend Ms. Slater, but I feel that a 2 star rating fits this movie perfectly!"
2,No Way Back ... Thank Heaven,"Stupid story. Since when do skinheads work for the Mafia? And how did the Japanese get involved? When is the last time a Mafia king-pin kidnapped an FBI agent's son? Nevertheless, Helen Slater saves this from the re-cycle bin. She is sweet and good-natured and her scenes with Russell Crowe are the best part of the movie. (Get a hair-cut and a shave Russell. I got sick of watching you push your hair out of your eyes, only to have it fall back into disarray.) We saw L. A. Confidential and liked the three leads, Crowe, Spacey and Pearce, so we have been shopping for more of their work. We should have passed on this one."
3,Why I tapes this movie,"I tapes this film for one reason: Russell Crowe. True, this is not the best movie in the world. I don't even remember if it was released or was a cable, straight to video deal. No contender for Best Picture, & Russell did need to shave."
2,HUGE Russell Crowe fan but hated this movie,"I have almost all of Russell Crowe's movies, but unfortuneatly this may be his worst. Everything about it goes against what Russell prides himself in making a movie. His charactar's dialogue is contrived and unrealistic. He is famous for battling directors when it comes to the integrity of his charactar, but he didn't win this battle. His co-star Helen Slater played a stupid girl with stupid lines, again a co-star's charactar the Russell must have had little patience for. I can overlook a bad movie and still enjoy Russell, but I wasn't able to in this one."
2,My film spree,"I admit that I've gone on a Russell Crowe film spree. I think he is an amazing actor with unbelieveable range and depth. But this has to be the weakest film of his that I've seen. I haven't seen the first 3 films that he was in or ""Love in Limbo"", ""Rough Magic"" & ""Heaven's Burning"". So my opinion could change. This is after all just my opinion.I don't think the director knew what to do with his actors besides making them run around. This is film... let the actors faces tell some of the story. I just didn't feel that connection I've come to expect from Mr. Crowe.As far as Russell doing the the New York/New Jersey accent there was a bean instead of a bin/been. But I only noticed that one slip. Picky, picky, picky. Next"
3,Got to get a living,"No one would say this film is worth to keep forever, but... But, as one third zone thriller, one migth say the buying is acceptable. Certainly the occasion to see Russell Crowe in a widower/father part. A pity the relationship with the boy is so bad shown, a pity the character are so thin. A Z movie only available in video rental. Try it."
3,"FBI agent, widowed father in an action filled fix","This is not Crowe's best OR worst movie. I found a lot of heart in this story of a father trying to save his son, by going against his bosses, to surrrender an alleged murderer to the father of his victim. Good shoot out up front, good one in the middle, good ending. Great AZ location shoot!Helen Slater added much humor to a serious story, and Russell plays well with her character. Gives him a chance to smirk and crack wise. (Note the KIWI Mary carves for Zack).Anyone notice how there always seems to be some reference to Australia or NZ in every Crowe non-Australian or NZ movie? Worth a look for the Crowe fan. I love the long hair & beard."
3,If collecting the lot...,"While I am a huge fan of Crowe's... this was NOT one of his better performances.There is plenty of action, more than average suspense but the dialogue is lacking greatly.Phrases and sentences that just don't make a lot of sense permeate the entire script. More specifically, I found myself saying ""would they REALLY say that in this situation???"".Russell drops in and out of his ""American"" accent, which is a painful reminder of the fact that this is one of the earlier films in his now stalwartly coral of films.STILL, that all being said... if you are collecting the lot of them... it is worth the purchase if not for anything other than to be able to see just how far he has come.Enjoy!"
1,No Way Back from buying this clunker,"The first six minutes were promising. With a cast that included Russell, Kelly and Ian, I thought this would be a B movie that would be an enjoyable romp. Was I ever wrong. This movie just went straight downhill from the get go. Besides there being absolutely no chemistry between Crowe and Slater, it was painful to watch them. It was a painful experience all the way around."
2,"Not bad, not good",I like a few songs on this album but not very many. I'm a little disappointed that they didn't put very many good songs on it like they did on some of their other albums. Oh well. Must be because it's old or something... Got some good artists/songs on this album though.
3,"Wordy, wordy, wordy","Some people will be drawn in to his conversational style, so more power to them. But the insights that are present are buried beneath a torrent of words. He could use a judicious editor and a proof-reader. He also needs someone to steer him away from vast generalizations.The cover of the book is interesting. An intriguing photo that suggests an Asian young person, perhaps a female. But the book is written by a Caucasian male. And the Asian face suggests perhaps Buddhism will be found inside, when it seems rather to be a mixture of religious beliefs and practices."
5,All men should read this book,"This book tells the story of Paul Pokreife, a journalist living in modern Germany. Paul is collecting information on the sinking of a German cruise ship during WW2, but this book is about so much more than that. It is about living in a country that is stangling under a political correctness that shuts off discussion of the past and oppresses its people in the present, producing ugly and frightening effects.For me, the most touching scene is during Konrad's (Paul's son) trial, when the judicial system heaps blame upon Paul for the crime of being a male! Paul accepts the misandrist abuse, crushed as he is by the women in his life, and sees his son taken away, even more thoroughly destroyed by the system than himself. This is a touching book that all men should read."
1,Crabwalk walked,It never arrived. Was claimed lost in the mail. Good part - my money was refunded promptly and there was another copy on Amazon to purchase. Waiting to receive that one.
3,In the Prism of History.,"This book examines an historical fact: the sinking of the former Nazi ""classless cruise ship"" the Wilhelm Gustloff, laden with refugees from Eastern Germany in the last days of the war. The event becomes a prism through which the attitudes of three generations of Germans are refracted. Tulla Pokriefke, as a pregnant young woman, was one of the few survivors of the disaster; once an ardent Nazi, she became an equally ardent Stalinist; clearly she has a great need to belong. Her son Paul was born on the rescue vessel; now a journalist, he has few strong feelings, although he doggedly pursues his research into the sinking. And Paul's estranged teenage son Konrad turns out to run a website with neo-Nazi sympathies. All is interesting, but the tone is curiously detached and unemotional -- events as filtered through the internet rather than experienced first-hand. While this may be true to the mindset of a certain generation of Germans, it also blunts the book's impact as a novel."
4,The Cycle of History,"""Crabwalk"" starts slowly but soon weaves a hypnotic spell as the reader is yanked backwards and forwards through the history of modern Germany. It is with a sense of disgust that we watch events unfold - first the horrific sinking of a ship full of refugees, then the hardening of a survivor into a true believer, then a man's disassociation with all that has come before and finally the next generation's embracing of fascistic ideals of martyrdom and national revenge.The ending of ""Crabwalk"" shows how the German people's willed amnesia has created yet another underclass to fear.Chilling stuff."
4,It will never end,"Within this novel, the narrator effectively uses the characters personal observations of, as well as documents from, the past (of whose accuracy we cannot be completely certain) to obtain an understanding of the characters present day condition and motivations. The book demonstrates how remembrances (whether true or false) of this era of German history can provide useful fodder, fodder which forms our personal relationship with the past and which can guide or justify behavior in the present. And how the resulting behavior (e.g. pro or anti skinhead movements), can in turn, provide more ""useful material"" to be further manipulated by either. ""It will never end"". Translation could have been better, thus 4 and not 5 stars."
5,An excellent view of contemporary Germany,"Gunter Grass, born in Danzig, has seen Germany emerge from the rubble of the Second World War, through its division and reuinification, into the 21st century as one of the leading powers in the European Union. ""The Tin Drum"" explored repressed Nazi episodes, ""Too Far Afield,"" the persistent wounds of the Cold War, and now, in ""Crabwalk,"" how Germany attempts to come to terms with this tumultuous half century and move on. The story span three generations of Germans, but one sentence sums up the contemporary mindset of the country: ""The Germans keep flushing and flushing, but the sh*t keeps coming up."""
3,Grass Almost Makes the Great Comeback,"Gunter Grass has been undreadable for too many years. The magic of the Danzig Trilogy petered out after ""The Flounder."" But here in ""Crabwalk"" one is reminded of this great voice. Unfortunately the novel suffers from a narration that is too stubborn. If in fact the Gustloff ranks as one of the all-time sea disasters, the weight of this needs to be more important than the narrator's fears and denial. I found much to love in Grass' attempt to balance the sinking of the ship with the sinking of the narrator's life, but I felt it was unnecessarily coy at times. But still, a 3-star Grass is as good as one can ask for in these Shock and Awe days."
5,Worth the money,"I bought this device strictly to use with my Dell Inspiron laptop while watching DVD concerts---only with my headphones. The software allows you to choose from a concert hall environment to a padded cell! Actually about a couple dozen choices and yes, they do make a difference. You can also adjust the direction of sound, from stationary to ""moving"" from side-to-side, etc. I went straight to the website to download the software for my Vista Home Premium instead of using the installation C.D. For the cost of this little sound card, it's worth every penny!Jerry"
4,Good product,Small and convenient. Good sound. Need to reinstall the driver sometimes when change USB socket. It would be better if comes with a longer USB cable.
1,pops and clicks,Poor audio quality: clicks and pops. Even tweaking windows XP hardware video acceleration did not help.
1,Turtle Beach product support lacking,"This company discontinued their support for their older, but recent, products, rather than offer drivers for 64 bit systems. They do not stand behind what they sell... no matter how good a product is, if support dries up, it becomes so much useless junk in a hurry."
1,Eugh - Yuk!,"Some of you guys must have some crummy soundcards installed on your machines if this widget sounds better than your stock unit.In theory of course, the AA micro should be the business. It's a dedicated D/A or D/D unit as far as I can tell. But the transients are terribly produced - No solid sound stage, I'm also hearing added noise. And I'm not expecting audiophile quality either! I'm using a mid range pair of Sennheisers on my IBM X40 Thinkpad. Seriously, the installed sound card is quieter and does a far better job. I tried a variety of apps (musicmatch, mediaplayer, audition) with the same results. The noise is not constant, so must be in the conversion stages, instead of interference.Wanted to love this - but it's rubbish."
5,great product,"sound card on my laptop went out, instead of spending hundreds in repairs, bought this $30 card and fixed the problem. Simple as that."
5,The right choice,"My 3.5 yo Dell laptop blew its on-board sound card. The cost to fix it was prohibitive. One tech I talked to suggested an external USB sound card. After looking at the choices on Amazon and elsewhere, it appeared that there was a correlation between price and quality, so I went with this one for $29 vs one for $10 or less. Very happy I did. The sound is great through my headphones, and the software provides some interesting options. You have to play around with those options a bit - I did not find them intuitive, but that was relatively minor and the reason I gave it 4 of 5 on ease of use. Bottom line: Spend the extra $20, it's worth it."
5,No more hiss,"I bought this to eliminate the hiss, buzz, and crackle from my on-board audio, and for that purpose it works flawlessly. I didn't need to install any drivers under xp or xp64."
4,Does the job at a great price,I bought this for an older laptop that had incompatibilities between the built in sound andWindows XP sp3. Installation was quick and easy. It works in both the USB 1.0 and 2.0 slots.It definitely is an improvement over the built in sound. I noticed right away. The onlycomplaint I have (a minor one) is that it has no keyring like a lot of memory devices thesame size.
5,the item is very good,"the sound card of my laptop is broken, so I bought this device, finally I can hear sound again."
1,"great seller, terrible product","I ordered the TBAAM thinking it would provide better sound than my soundmax integrated audio on my 5 yr old laptop. And I was WRONG! the TBAAM sounds murky, unclear, and simply awful. NOT recommended."
4,Vista and DD/DTS,"I use the SPDIF output to connect to a DD/DTS 5.1 speaker system (Pioneer HTS-GS1 5.1-Channel Surround Sound System for the Xbox 360) from a Windows Vista laptop. It's nearly flawless. I experience some crackling/popping noises with some music files (not DVD's) but I can work around it by toggling between the SPDIF and analog ouputs in the software. For the price, I can live with this infrequent nuisance. Overall, a fantastic product for the capability it adds. Why don't laptops come standard with SPDIF outputs?Go to TB's website for the latest Vista drivers."
3,Inexpensive Optical Out for Laptops,The strength of this device is its ability to produce an optical output on a computer. this possibility is desirable for those audiophiles that have an external DAC without USB input. The use of the proprietary software that comes with the device is fun to play with but does not enhance sound quality.
5,Outstanding 3D surround sound,Amazing 3D Surround sound from this little device.Makes the music sound like you're actually there.
2,Good for loud OOOMPA-OOOMPA music,"...but not if you are listening classical and have more than below average requirements regarding sound reproduction quality. There is a ""hiss"" present all the time, cracking noises, nonlinear distortion, echo and other artifacts. I tried installing/uninstalling drivers, getting new drivers, all with no effect. If you want quality, get external sound device from XITEL"
4,Turtle Power,"Great fix for broken or lack of a headphone (1/8"") jack. Works great! Just plug-in, and play! Amplifies the signal. For the money you can't beat it."
1,Not practicable in Windows XP in non Administrator accounts,"Like most device drivers the Turtle Beach specific driver needs to be installed with Administrative rights. Nothing unusual.However, when a Non Administrator logs on (as is good security practice) the driver says is needs to be reinstalled, which is not possible without Administrator rights. Catch-22.Not usable for me as I don't use the Administrator account except for special purposes, a security ""best practice"". Without the Turtle Beach specific driver it works as a generic USB sound card with the default Microsoft driver(no reinstallation required!). No special sound effects then, so not worth the extra price premium over a generic USB sound card.Too bad the poor software implementation ruined a good piece of hardware, as when it works it sounds great."
4,Early In The Morning,"Late 60's, early 70's.....soft rock British groupcame out with two great songs...Early In The Morning,and Hitchin' A Ride. This CD replaces my worn out LPwith the same 2 songs, and it includes another dozenor so songs that were popular in England."
3,All For One,I bought this CD only for the song Hitchin' A Ride. I bought a CD with it previously that turned out to be a different version I didn't care for.
2,movie,lovers of their time-i found the movie to be very boring and poorly made. i already gave it away -disappointing.
5,sign,"Great sign! Gets the attention of trespassers entering my vacant property. There are plenty of snakes on that property and it's impossible to keep them out, or the unwanted people. Too bad I can't find a sign that says ""Caution People"" for the rattlesnakes."
4,"Abstraction, Specification & OOD explained well @ this book!","Percect book for a computer science student who must learn the fundemantal concepts of Object Oriented Design (OOD) in order to success and able to design and develop production quality software that are reliable, easy to mantain and modifiable.. It outlines the important steps for each chapter but the order of the chapters should be rearranged."
2,Liskov is not so great,"Just don't bother with it. Read Stroustrup all the way through and you'll be better off. If you really MUST do Java, read the online Java docs from Sun, starting with the tutorials. They discuss the same things Liskov does but without the idea of specification.Use a tool like JavaDoc or Deoxygen consistantly through your program and not only have you gained everything else Liskov discusses, you haven't spent time wading through her, often contradictory, arguments on the subject.Thats not quite fair, if you really do believe that an Object is a model of something in the real world, and not a clever piece of syntax for expressing your logic and enhancing readibility, than you will very likey LOVE this book."
5,"Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, you're the best!","Dr. Brazelton covers your child's world, from 0 to 3 years. ""Touchpoints"" is a great beginner book for anyone with questions on babies; once you pick it up, you won't put it down. Jam-packed with everything you always wanted to know, plus stuff you didn't know you should ask, Touchpoints provides a working vocabulary you can use on doctor visits. It is a frame of reference for many ""standard"" baby crises and those that aren't so common, providing examples of appropriate responses. Once you know how a baby's brain is laid out, and that you can say ""no"" but that it won't register until a small person is 3 years of age and begins to comprehend that consequences exist, you'll look to understand much more about children than previously, and enjoy them thoroughly. See Dr. Brazelton's TV show, ""What Every Baby Knows""."
3,A nice reference book,"I was fortunate enough to purchase this book used (cheap:-))through Amazon.com. This book is interesting although I didn't learn anything I didn't already learn someplace else. Although in all fairness, by now my baby is 8 months old and have passed through the most difficult first eight weeks. I would recommend it to people who are having their first baby and don't know where to start in deciphering the emotions of their newborn, and boy is there a lot to know about that! I wish you all the best of luck, and please try to learn as much as you can BEFORE the baby arrives so you won't be up at 3am anxiously flipping through all of your baby manuals trying to figure out what is going on."
2,Never used it to solve actual problems,"I got this book when I was pregnant and started to read it then. I had a lot of trouble with the writing style - Brazelton came across as so full of himself that I had trouble learning from him. I put it down when I couldn't stand it anymore. Now that I have been a mommy for a year I realize that I have never relied on this book. I have tried to look up information about developmental milestones, breastfeeding, eating, and sleep but never found anything to answer my questions here."
3,"Some good points, but little in the way of reference.","When my wife and I purchased our library of child care and development books upon the arrival of our first child, I got this one, too, based upon Amazon's recommendations and the author's expertise. I agree with the reviewer from Eugene, OR, who can't decide if this is supposed to be a child-development reference, or Brazelton's musings, and reflections and experiences in dealing with parents. While the author is apparently an expert, the text provides little practical or useful information, and, in my opinion, is an example of an expert ""dipping into the well (at least) once too often"".If you already have several references and are simply building up your library on emotional development of children, this may be a selection for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
2,"Couldn't ""get into"" the book","As a first-time parent, I bought about every parenting book I could get my hands on. This was not one of the better ones. I forced myself to read the first few chapters, but never picked it up again. I couldn't get past the sense that Brazelton wrote with an air of egotisism when he wrote this. It sounded more like self-exaltation to me (""I see this [pregnancy] as the first 'touchpoint' . . ."") than as nitty-gritty practical adivce for parents. At first I thought is was just me, but Iv'e talked to other people who have thought Brazelton seems awfully full-of-himself in this book. Brazelton is, however, one of the leading authorities on infant development, and a very gentle, family-centered physician. The strenghts of this book lie with his good insight into coliky babies and his interesting views on potty-training. I have decided to keep the book until I am done potty-training for this very reason, even though it is not one of my essential references."
2,Pretty vague about a lot of things,I felt that this book really just skims the surface of so much. Maybe Dr. Brazelton just wants to give a little info so that you will buy his other books... but I was unimpressed with this book.
2,A mixed bag.,"This book contained some interesting information and had a section on most any topic a reader might want help with. Where it fails is that the author greatly overemphasizes the importance of actively helping the baby move forward, instead of respecting that many children move forward on their own at an astonishing rate and are only slowed down by parental pushing. I found the book disappointing and, despite a format that was easy to read and to find specific topics in I would not recommend it unless you have an approach to child rearing which is consistent with his."
2,randomly helpful,"Despite Brazelton's medical degree and experience I found this book as mixed and confusing as most of the ""baby whisperer"" genre of baby books. His observations based on real research and larger bodies of evidence are sometimes helpful but his personal opinions (most of the book) are often infuriating and quite prejudiced (i.e. it's better to have more than one child because a sibling forces a child to share. Good God) I prefer Penelope Leach or Sears for good common sense insights and less moralizing."
5,"I love this book. It's 2am, and I'm reading it right now.","I constantly refer to it, and it's got great, relevant advice for a wide range of ages. Since my baby's now a toddler, most of my baby books are now gathering dust in my closet. But I still read and refer to this one all the time. A MUST have!"
3,A mixed bag,"This book offers some good sound advice (e.g. about toilet training) but it also is way off the mark sometimes, especially some of the ""touchy-feely"" type language Dr. Brazelton suggests using with small children. For example, with regard to discipline, telling a child, ""I love you, but I can't let you do this. Someday you'll learn to stop yourself, and then I won't need to stop you,"" sounds phony and too difficult for a child to grasp. It also seems to set some high expectations for various types of behavior and can make the reader question his/her parenting skills as much as improve them. In all, this is a good reference for ideas and perspectives, but not the child-rearing Bible I'd been expecting."
5,Berry Brazelton is the Best!,Dr. Brazelton's books guided my through the first years of my son's life twenty-six years ago. His books continue to be my top choice as a gift for new moms. His advise is caring and practical and takes into account (broadly) the different types of personalities babies come with and how best to nurture and cope with the unique needs of each child.
5,"Not easy, but important","This book is not an easy read but it is an important read. For those of us who believe (as I formerly did) that legislators' intent should form a basis for interpretation of a difficult statute, this essay will help you discover just how slippery is that slope."
3,Maybe if my attention span was better...,"...I'd rate this book a little higher. I am almost always in agreement with Justice Scalia. I enjoyed ""his"" portion of the book, but fell asleep as the other writers volleyed back. This book was a little too burdensome for me, and likely so for anyone other than an L3 or above. Bork's book, The Tempting Of America, was much more readable and enjoyable. See also Johnnie Cochran, A Lawyer's Life.I like a good debate just as anyone else does, but this book descends into the realm of ""pinhead intellectualism."" I guess that's necessary in the nuts-and-bolts of appellate law, but that leaves a very small audience of satisfied book buyers.While it's main point - the difference between being a ""textualist"" versus a ""strict constitutionalist"" is well taken, for most of us this book is a tough read. If you're Harvard Law (or Hofstra), go ahead."
4,Scalia vs. Breyer,"I read the text by Scalia at about the same time as I read Active liberty by Stephen Breyer. I found Scalia's text fun and informative, but Breyer's book wise and informative. I found Scalia's text to be more based on opinions whereas Breyer's text was more evidence based. Scalia's writings more personal emotional, Breyer's writings more emotional on behalf of the American society. I would suggest that any curriculum should include both texts because they, together, build a picture of the US society in judicial terms. To a non-US person, they help us understand why the US societies are as they are, ranging from Sarah Pailin's to Barac Obama's, as well as understand their additional idiosyncrasies."
3,Not as incisive or insightful as I expected,"Frankly, I was disappointed in the depth of insight and reflection offered in this book. This little volume is essentially a recapitulation of a narrow and shallow view of Constitutional Law and exegesis of the US Constitution that lacks a unifying logic or point of view that underlies it. And, I found him disingenuous in that he adopts a literalist position while knowing full well that no such position is possible in reading documents more complex and abstract than simple assembly instructions. His responses to the criticisms of Dworkin, Glendon, Tribe and Wood were frequently glib and self-indulgent, even self-congratulatory. Contrast this work with Justice Breyer's Active Liberty."
4,"old story, but an esy read","I have always enjoyed Mr. Asimov's writing. ""I, Robot"" is most interesting because of the references to things which are no more, like slide rules. His stories are more adventures that have a science fiction bend to them.This is really a collection of stories that he had published in some John(?) Campbell magazine in the 40's. I like the way he ties them all together. It makes the stories seem all that much more interesting."
3,The origin of the robot,"Okay, I have to admit that this is a important work in the genre of science fiction. Asmimov introduces us to the concept of robots and to the robot laws. I don't know what it was, but some of the stories I enjoyed and some I found a bit boring. Overall I felt the book was uneven, but worth the read because of it's historical significance in the genre."
4,"This is the ""real Asimov"", not the movie...","While the movie does mention ""The Three Laws of Robotics"", that is about the limit of its relation to I, Robot the book (which basically is a collection of short stories from the late-40's/early 50's, which advanced the ideas of what a robot could be).The stories in the book are decent enough, but overall are not good enough to rate it 5 stars.If you really want to read an Asimov book that is like the movie, try ""The Caves of Steel"". It is a robot murder mystery, and it is really Asimov's premiere work, and not a collection of short stories. I understand someone is trying to make a movie out of ""The Caves of Steel""... but maybe the I, Robot movie beat them to the punch - because I haven't heard anything else about a ""The Caves of Steel"" movie in quite awhile."
3,The 3 laws.,The 3 laws are the books most redeeming quality. The book does tend to drag at times and I was a bit disappointed to find the main focus of the book was the humans. Who are shown as not much more than very intelligent brats. They argue and insult each other. None of them ever seem to get on with each other. The thing that made it readable for me was the problems the robots suffer and the logic used to defeat each problem was captivating. But the characters and many of the robots seemed bland. However this book was written quite awhile ago and I think that has to be taken into account. If you are interested in the robot series then give it a read. If you are interested in Asimov books in general then start with one of his other works.
2,It's nice....,"I picked this book up because of an online friend was raving about the series. Well all I can say about this book is that it has a few nice stories to it. My main problem is the fact that it has little to no substance to it. I did not learn anything from the story, I did not gain any insight, I do not think about things differently any more. This book just reminds me of a cartoon series because of the different short stories. I would have found this book infinitely more interesting if it focused on say the stories ""Robbie"" or ""Reason"". Another problem I have is that all of the solutions to the problems that arose in every story came to quickly to the flat characters. Generally, I am very disappointed."
2,At Least We Got the Three Laws,"The three laws of robotics, which has become a science fiction staple, is the only redeeming aspect of this book. Asimov's characters are squabbling children and the dialogue wouldn't pass muster in a Flash Gordon serial. I'll attribute this to the time in which these stories were written just to be fair. Most writers also try to make their characters appealing and usually base them on aquaintances. Judging by these characters, one wonders what kind of people Asimov must have been friends with."
2,Its alright but not a master piece,The book I robot was entertaining and thats about it. Yes I know it was a milestone as one of the first books about robots ever. But his other works I consider to be much better.The Foundation series is written superbly and is excellent. I Robot I found dull and a some what waste of my time. Its stories are not new. All concepts in the stories are all well known. If you really want to read some good Asimov read the Foundation series or the caves of steel. I found I robot to be Drono.
4,"Great book, But it's not the same book cover!","I always wanted to buy this classic science fiction book and I chose this one because it has the vintage painting representing the short story ""Runaround"" on the cover. I don't know if there is such a thing anymore because the book that I receive has the poster of the Will Smith movie I, Robot on the cover. I like the movie; it wasn't a faithful adaptation but it is still a good movie. But, it's just not what I wanted. I didn't send the book back because I started reading it (again) as soon as I got it, or else I would have sent it back! Amazon Guys! Do something about the picture!"
2,"Hard to read, hard to follow","I stuck with this book for the long run, as it was assigned to my middle school son and I assumed it would be worth it. His wrjiting style was so difficult and frustrating for me yet I plugged onward. I would not recommend unless you are a huge sci-fi fan. I think you will find the style too conversational and disjointed."
3,"Great ideas, but funky organization","As a person who saw the movie first, I was rather surprised that Will Smith's character made no appearance in the novel (despite that fact that he's on the front cover of the new paperback edition), as well as the factthat Dr. Calvin is 75 years old. If you are expecting to to read the movie in print form, don't bother with this book; you will be dissapointed.Now, Hollywood expectations aside, I will say that Asimov weaved some excellent ideas into his novel. Rather than one main plot, the book actually consists of several flashbacks detailing the evolution of robots. None of the characters are particularly likable, but the Isaac's robotic theories and concepts are enough to keep you reading. Because the story relies of several flashbacks that are only loosely tied together, the book feels somewhat disorganized. Nevertheless, if you have an interest in robots, sci-fi, or are just looking for something different to read, I recommend this novel."
2,the mind and character of a robot,this book isnt great--written in the 50's--it really doesnt hold up these daysthe characters are too flat in descriptioni would pass on this one
4,A true classic,"Asimov is truly a genious. This book was alot of fun. Although some of the concepts are dated, that can be forgiven due to the age of the book. Asimov truly forsaw the way the world was heading, he was just a little optimistic about the timeline.This book is more or less a book of shortstories concerning the three laws of robotics. Although the main characters are human (or are they), the robots steal the show. The stories connect on an emotional level with the reader, which is why they have lasted after the technology of the stories has been outdated.This book is suitable for anyone whom can read it. There is no sexual material and almost no violence. Parents should not fear this book. It is not a children's book though. There are political and social messages to find if you look closely. Science Fiction the way it was meant to be."
5,A thought provoking piece of science,"I, Robot is governed around three laws that perpetuate the plot1. A robot may not injure a human or through inaction let a human come to harm2. A robot must obey all orders given to it, unless the order conflicts with the first law3.A robot mus protect itself from harm unless this conflicts with the first and second laws.From this premise comes 9 wonderfully woven tales of adventure, science, and human behavior. For not only does Asimov study the existence and possibilties of Robots, but their individual actions and thoughts pararlell human actions in many different ways. In a sense it is a testatment of the power of man over time, a different view of the future, but also a view into how people act on a whole no matter the time period."
1,Yuk!,"Going to the dentist and having root canal would sound more appealing than being subjected to reading this book. As it was required reading by our school, may I say, it put a damper on the summer. The last story, in the series, was the biggest yawn of all, and if it wasn't for coffee, I would have nodded off completely. (Two thumbs down on this one.)"
1,Garbage!,"This book was terrible, plain and simple! I couldn't imagine anyone else having to suffer through reading I, Robot. Its really a piece of trash."
5,Fantabulous,"I don't understand why some idiots compare the book and the movie. The book was written thousands of years before the movie and people bitch out the book because of the movie?!? If you don't like robots and/or science fiction, why oh why read any of it??? WARNING : Whatever you do don't read StarShip Troopers! I can't stand poetry, do you see me reading poetry and blabbing on how much I hated it? Get a clue people. This is a great book.I want to be robot psychologist when I grow up ; )"
3,This Creaky Classic is Showing Some Rust,"If you keep in mind that this book was written in 1950, you can understand why it was considered ahead of it's time. Unfortunately, time has since passed ""I, Robot"" by.Asimov was the first author to seriously consider the psychology of the thinking machine. Through the course of the nine short-stories in this book, Asimov cleverly chronicles the robot evolution. The machines go from from mute and loyal nursemaid to benevolent overseers that govern humanity.But as one reviewer previously stated, Asimov seems a better thinker than writer. And the archaic writing style and stilted dialogue (so obviosuly written in the 50's) tend to be distracting from his brilliant ideas. And even those ideas have been better explored in recent years in much more provacative ways. Then again, without ""I, Robot"", there wouldn't be ""The Matrix"", or ""The Terminator"".The book is a classic. But you might want to read it before it becomes an antique."
5,"Amazing, as always","Asimov 's insight into a possible future with robots is phenomenal and thought-provoking. His writing style draws in the reader, making them want more. Luckily, this book is just the beginning of the Robot series."
5,Keeps You Guessing,"There are similarities between the Book & the Movie, but not in the manner that you would think. A very imaginative & creative piece of work.I Like It!!!"
3,"Classic, don't even see the movie","This is a series of stories, it's not one long novel, it has absolutley nothing to do with the dumb film that Will Smith starred in. The only thing the film has in common with the book, is the rules of robotic programming that is it! The rules of robotics make for so many interesting dillemas, because Artificial Intelligence is challenged in ways the original programming could never possibly predict, I don't want to give specific plot ""spoilers"" but the phenomenon of AI is really put to the test in this novel, robots are put in situations that can sometimes confuse their programming and make for interesting drama. If you like science fiction, give Asimov a try in this or ""The God's Themselves"" which is even better."
3,Great short stories,Excellent Short stories and especially ones that make you think. The last one is very much a thinking story.
5,cool book!!!,"im in 7th grade... its cool to see how he could think of such things like psytronic brains, and in the book, he would talk about them and robot parts like he was painting or drawing... hes a good writer. im currently reading caves of steel... great book so far!"
5,"Remarkable, this book is!","It has been at least a year and a half since I have willingly read anything besides comic books, graphic novels, or manga, and although I read this book for a school project, I enjoyed its contents far more than I did many comic book series'. The idea of Robots that not only can think about the world ""outside of the box"" but that also may develop feelings or human characteristics (such as a sense of humor) was profoundly innovative. After reading this, I immediately read one of Mr. Asimov's other books (The Fantastic Voyage) and found it equally enjoyable. The ideas and theories he impresses upon his readers are remarkable, and to pass up the chance to read the stories contained in this book would be folly. Therefore, read and review! :P"
4,The Stage-setter for modern robotics.,"A masterpiece collection of stories of the early robots of Asimov's universe, where weird problems with the psychology of Three Law robots is carefully and logically detailed and then just as carefully solved. Pure mind games abound. Wonderful book."
3,A look at robot history,"I enjoyed I, Robot, but probably won't ever reread it. As far as the content goes it is an interesting exploration of the development of artificial intelligence. At times though it became a little too technical or dry to be really enjoyable, especially considering all the tech or politics involved were totally fictional and isolated within that chapter. Nothing like the movie, the book almost reads like one person's memory of 70 years, skipping back episodically. I would definitely reccommend it to anyone who likes Heinlein"
3,"Reading The I ,Robot Book","If you really love science fiction this is definetly your book to read. If your not a big fan of science fiction you might want to read something different.The book is called I,Robot.I thought this book was an ok book.The reason why I wasn't so fond of it was because it was hard to keep track of what was happening,and where the people were.This book was about robots being built and having to protect or work for their master.While being able to follow the Laws of Robotics which is 1.A robot may not injure a human or put a human in harms way.2.A robot must obey orders of master unless orders would conflict with first law.3.A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with first or second law.But there is a twitch in one of the robots systems,and it affects all of the robots,and they begin to go mad,and.... I was almost going to tell you,but you will just have to read it yourself.That is the book I read and what it's about."
2,"""I, Robot"" Review by WarHawk23","I was very disappointed with the book, ""I, Robot"", by Isaac Asimov. I found that this book was not nearly as suspensful as I expected it would be, and there was no major climax at the end of the book. This book consists of several short stories that are connected by two main characters. Each story is about a different robot and a different conflict. It just did not appeal to my liking, mostly because of the way this book was written. I also like books with more action, suspense, and an exciting ending, and in my opinion ""I, Robot"" had none of these things. I did not feel like the book was interesting enough to keep turning the pages to see what was going to happen next. I have read other Science Fiction books that I have enjoyed much more than Mr. Asimov's book ""I, Robot"". I would not recommend this book to other Middle school readers."
1,This sucks,"This sucks, I can buy the hard back copy and chop down trees but the Kindle version is.....This title is not available for customers from:AustraliaThank... why did I buy a Kindle again?"
2,NOT a novel,"This is a collection of Asimov short stories written over the ten year period between 1940 & 1950, and then collected together, abridged, and given a thin narrative to tie them all together. Read ""The Complete Robot"" instead."
3,A useful photo accessory,"I agree with the criticisms that previous reviewers have put forward (except regarding the flimsiness of the material; it holds up just fine under rough conditions). The flap is the potential strength of the filter pouch, but it is not designed as well as it should be. So it does get in the way a bit while providing very imperfect protection against dirt and dust. Nevertheless, this is a good way to keep a filter or two handy. I carry the pouch when I use my small point-and-shoot camera; I keep a small polarizing filter in the pouch and manually hold it in front of the lens when I want to polarize the light (usually water or sky). The pouch is not excellent, but it is usable and useful."
4,"Novel two-sided design, but sometimes a little clunky to work with","The case does a good job of protecting filters, but it can be little unwieldy to insert and remove them because of the overlapping flap-style cover."
3,Filter pack,"the OP/Tech filter pack is rather large, holds two filters and offers only protection from dust. Rubbing, (scratching), or shock aren't part of the protective package. It also seems that for this large a pack more filters could be accommodated. However, it is as described in the sales promo, so caveat emptor."
2,There are better options out there,"Although this book contains reasonable explanations of Attic Greek grammar, the practice sentences and appendices are deplorable. I often wonder whether I have translated a sentence correctly because it does not make sense in English. For anyone familiar with Wheelocks concise, clear, and generally wonderful grammatical appendices, this book will be quite a shock -- the verbs are not arranged in anything even resembling a clear order, and all of the headings are in the same typeface, which makes them difficult to find on the page. A much better text, particularly for independent study, is the Joint Association of Classical Teachers' _Reading Greek_ series, which has a companion book specifically designed for independent study. I highly recommend it."
2,There are superior texts to be found (God willing),"I have no doubt that Dr. Groton is a top notch classical scholar but this grammar text is very, very disappointing. Most of the grammar explanations are too short and way overloaded with technical definitions. Even more frustrating are the practice sentences--they are hard to translate because when translated they hardly make sense in English! They are very convoluted and utterly uninteresting. There are selected adapted stories from Aesop in the first 25 chapters and while these may have some merit, I find them dull. I am a college student and I imagine most people who use this text are and I find the fables uninteresting. It really is a shame that a format like Wheelock's Latin could not be adapted to Greek; I think adapted sentences from Plato or Homer would be far superior to tanslating such sentences as ""Oh Goddess, let the wise boys pursue the maidens into the sea"" or similarly trite and contrived constructions."
2,UN-personalized!,"Item is as described, but did not have my dog's name,or any name, on it as was promised."
3,Not bad but not good,Only 2 good masturbating scenes and thats about it The title of this dvd is misleading and so was the description But if you like british women you'll love one of the girls and enjoy watching her talk and do her thing
3,Kind of feels like those lightweight synthetic type of blankets,"Perhaps I don't know enough about blankets, but this isn't what I hoped it would be. For $260 I expected a very well made, soft yet heavyweight type of wool blanket. This is VERY lightweight and, if it weren't for it's claim of being 100% wool, I might mistake it for one of those lightweight, synthetic foam-type of blankets.Overall it's a nice blanket but, IMHO, not nearly worth so much money."
5,Delightful and in a fine tradition,"The Irish have long memories, and even longer tales to reflect that. This book is a wonderful way to get children caught up in the excitement and tension of a classical tale, while also giving them a resourceful and modern heroine to admire. The book is everything a children's story should be: it's funny, the languish reads well and beautifully, and the illustrations are well done. This is a must-have."
1,warning!,Buyer beware! This product contains 4800 mg of sodium per package. It is WAY too salty. Unnecessarily so. It would have a decent flavor otherwise but the sodium level makes it taste like battery acid.
4,Must read before Starborn,"Exciting throughout. Especially after page 94. Could not wait to read the sequel, Starborn. Was easy to follow the story."
5,The Stars Are Ours!,"The Stars are Ours! Was the very first book I purchased with my Babysitting money waaaaay back in the sixth grade. If you read only one Andre Norton Book this is the one..but if you are like me you'll get hooked on anything that Ms. Norton has or will write! I lost my original copy,but found a copy in a used book store...it was as exciting reading it again at 50 something as it was at 12!"
4,Samsung 173P is amazing!!!!,"Samsung has been an active topic of LCD display reviews on Bytesector in the past. Today we bring you a review on one of Samsungs' latest LCD monitors, the 173P. This display brings many key features to the table and delivers them in a great device. First of all, this is sort of the 171P the continuation in the ""17 inch P series"". This display comes with the highest contrast ratio I have seen in an LCD display yet; with a 700:1 ratio, they are no mistaking greys for whites or blacks. The back of this monitor is a nice pure white which leads us to believe that there was a bit of an Apple influence in the design of this display! Read on to find out what we think of this display. (full review available @ bytesector.com)"
4,Really useful book...but too darn big!,"Explain this to me: why is the actual size of the Chicago NFT larger than the NYC one? The one I have for NYC is small enough to fit in my pocket; but the Chicago version is just larger...too big to easily carry in a pocket (but it fits in a bag just fine).If for no other reason that the map of the downtown Pedway, this book is a must-purchase."
4,Good for laptop stand,"Works well, sturdy construction.I have my laptop (17"" macbook pro) on top of it. It helps clear up some desk real estate for wires and also raises my screen to eye-level (I'm trying to get into the whole ergonomics thing).I have a few cables in the tray (don't expect to put a lot of stuff in it though).The tray is approx 11.5""W x 1.5""H x 7.25"" DBetween the legs of the stand is about 12"" of clearance.This is probably more for a printer, but work great for a laptop stand!And It looks good too!Only Con: Tray could be a little higher, I'd like to put some more cables in it (but then again most people will use it for papers or smaller stuff)"
1,Looks good but very poor build quality,"I ordered two of these and didn't get around to assembling them until after the return window expired... One went together with minimal problems. The other one could not be assembled... The legs attach to the body by wing nuts that are supposed to screw onto bolts which are mounted permanently on the body. The wing nuts are of visibly low quality manufacture; the wholes are not centered and are not straight relative to the plane of the nut. On the one that worked it was difficult to screw them on but once I got them aligned ""properly"" by setting them up off center and not parallel to the surface they attached. The second stand could not be made to work. I might try going to home depot to see if I can find bolts that work. A wing nut is a pretty low tech device and should be a good ""no tools"" solution but in this case it went very wrong..."
5,Great little shelf!,"This has been a great addition to my work desk. It allows me to keep somethings out of sight, but right at my fingertips if I need them. It's the right size for what I need. Solid construction and nice appearance."
1,Poor Quality,Product came broken with one screw loose/unsecured so that pedestal/leg would not attach firmly. Better quality control would have caught this flaw.
3,Quality not what I expected,"I realize this is not the most expensive desk shelf, but I still expected better quality. When I opened the package a loose little metal tab fell out, turns out it is one of the drawer stoppers (to keep the drawer from sliding too far in). Doesn't really matter that its not attached though because the component of the shelf are aligned so poorly that the drawer doesn't go in straight anyway.The shelf seems sturdy enough, and I'm still going to use it because it was hard to find one that had the high clearance underneath that I need, but I won't buy any other items from this manufacturer in the future."
1,My allergist said not to use lotion tissues,"The lotion can help make your nasal tissues stick together. Also, some people can have some serious reactions to ingredients in the lotion. It was suggested I use plain white tissues with no color or lotions. If I wanted to lubricate my nasal passages, I should use saline spray or gel instead of lotion."
5,"Oh, thank goodness for PUFFS, NOT the other kind!","Long story short: these tissues are the ""charmin ultra"" of kleenex (I mean, facial tissue). They are soft and smooth..They make you feel clean after blowing your nose and they dont rip in half leaving your hands full of mucus. Oh, they are so nice and amazons price is not bad for the amount they are giving you. I have a cold right now and regret to inform you I am using Wal-Mart brand tissue!"
1,Allergic Reation to Puffs Plus Lotion,"I began using Puffs w/ Lotion last month during a cold as the days went by my nose got extremely itchy, bumpy and swollen, then began peeling. Terrible peeling! The itching was so bad that at night I had to use a mild cortizone. When I ran out of tissues I began using a non-lotion variety and within days the itchy red nose went away.Last week I grabbed a few Puffs with Lotion from the bathroom at work and with in hours the itchy bumps were back.No more Puffs w. Lotion for me!"
5,The Best,"This is the go-to book for serious artists. I you want to learn to draw figures, this is the best place to start. If you are a beginner, it will help you to understand the human body, if you are an accomplished artist, it will be an always-by-your side reference."
3,Was expecting a little more ...,"Not as in depth as I would have liked, but I guess it's hard to do that in a ""coat-sized"" book. Overall, it's okay ... just nothing that lights my world on fire."
4,"Excellent manual, but not up to the Merck","I bought this Medical Manual basically because of Dr. Anthony Fauci's involvement in it's production. The book is indeed excellent, but Is not as informative, nor as thorough as the Merck Manual, something I've been using as a source of medical information for 25 years. Perhaps that's the problem, I'm too used to the Merck. Harrison's is written in a style that's just a bit more simplistic than the Merck, which may be beneficial to some people who would otherwise need a Dorland's Medical Dictionary alongside their Merck. I'm by no means saying that the Harrison's is written for the novice, since that is certainly not the case, but when a physician is doing a quick refesher on a particular doseage, or diagnosis, you'll find he/she will turn to the Merck, even though the information contained in it can be older than Harrison's."
5,Excellent,"This pocket manual really does contain everything you could possibly need for an excellent pocket reference during your internal medicine rotation. Also clearly references the larger text, in case you want even more information."
5,great reference book,"Briefly speaking: this book is for people who are familiar with the field of Medicine. Every few years I have to get a new edition as medicine is developing so rapidly. As I am now out of the mainstream of Medicine, when I want to look up something I read this book and the Merck Manual and I look up words I don't know in the on-line medical dictionary. That provides a fairly good intro. If I want to know more I go into the papers on PubMed. As far as I'm concerned, this book is a must-have, if you want to try to keep up with the field."
4,good reference for internal medicine rotation,"Since the full-size Harrison's is rather...full-sized, this book is a good reference to take with you for studying at the hospital. It has good differentials of common patient presentations and covers the basics of common diagnoses and treatment."
2,Not quite...,"This was a film that I watched based purely on the synopsis; which sounded totally off the wall and interesting. Every now and again a super low budget indie film will fly way under the radar and end up being a gem... this is not one of those movies. I have no problem with the production value at all, this movie wasn't good because of the way the story was told and the acting. The premise was so cool and promising as the springboard for a quirky dark comedy, but instead it turned into an incomprehensible mess.The film ends up being overly confusing and convoluted... it just loses its way after about twenty minutes. Additionally some of the acting was quite suspect. Normally I'm not one to complain about acting, but a few spots of blatant cringe-inducing overacting forced me to take note. Such a disappointment, it's really too bad because this one could have been special if done right. 2/5 stars."
3,"Good compilation, but one big mistake...",..Neil Diamond obnoxiously assumed we would be entertained/intrigued/touched by letting his little kids be present on a few songs. It killed the CD set for me. I have copied the best songs and sold it already. Very disappointing. Otherwise he was great and his songs bring back alot of memories from the '70s.
1,More Lives Than A Cat,"Giving this man the box set treatment is like eating at McDonald's with fine silver. But, McDonald's at least gives out Happy Meals."
5,It's About Time!,"This is a definate must for all Neil Diamond fans. Not only are there some all-time favorites on this 3 disc set, but there are also some rare and very early Neil Diamond songs that most of us probably never heard before. In addition to the discs, there is a 70 page booklet with liner notes about Neil and a short note for each song by Neil himself. It's very informative. This boxed set is a must and I very highly recommed it. You won't be disappointed."
5,Perfect For Neil Lovers!!!!!,"I've Always been a Neil fan, ALWAYS!!! I was so HAPPY with this boxed set of wonderful music. Old hits that make you want to sing along and really great songs never before heard. I'm only 13 years old, and don't think I just like older music, I listen to the music of today, but no one in my opinion sings nor preforms better than the master himself...Neil Diamond!!! It's the best boxed set for ANY Neil lover...I gurentee!!!"
4,"Being a 56 yr. old Neil Diamond fan, I loved it !!!","My 21 yr. old son gave me this as a recent birthday present!! I love it , esp.the album notes as to the origins of the songs!!! I was a little disappointed that 2 of my favorites, Glory Road and Stones were not included! I feel that Stones played a big part in the lives of some of us ""way back when. "" After all, it was an album title!!""! As for Glory Roads, I can relate it to my 21 yr. old son!!!! We all have had ( and will have, hopefully ) our ""Glory Roads""!!!! and I am as old as Neil!!!"
5,In My Lifetimw,In My Lifetime is a great Neil Diamond boxed set. You get songs from the start of his musical career. The pictures in the book are great. It also tells about each song. I love it.
3,A great album,"I got this as a gift for my husband. It was just the right thing for a Neil Diamond fan. We enjoyed listening to his songs through the years, recalling our own past as we listened. Some of the songs would probably not have been heard except on this album and that made it even better."
3,A mixed bag,"This is great for the early (Bang) period - original, untampered-with mono mixes all; but the great MCA/Uni years are over too quickly (it cost 'em to liscence the songs!) and we don't get to hear ""Stones"" which is one of my faves. There's a nice truncated suite of J. Livingstone Seagull tunes, but the third disc doesn't hold up so well - in fact, after The Jazz Singer, Mr Diamond's muse seems to have deserted him for good and most of this last disc is awful, or worse, plain embarrasing."
5,Magic From A Master,"I used to think Neil Diamond was cheesy, but as I have matured now and look back on my life, I realize just how prolific this master storyteller has been and continues to be to this day. There is not a period of my life that I cannot place in direct relation to a Neil Diamond song, and I'll bet that is true for many of you too.This wonderful boxed set, is an impressive collection of the very best of Neil's work from the late 50's, through the present, remastered and packaged with a nice picture book to boot.It is great joy to hear these classic songs, sounding better than ever and bringing back all those memories that they are so indelibly attached to.I highly recommend this collection for any serious music lover."
4,Gunfighter's Bride Turned out to be a read all nighter,"I liked this story and read it in one setting. The opening scene caught me and then never let me go. Pregnant and single Lila is about to marry a man she does not love to avoid a scandal. The wedding is interrupted when gunfighter Bishop Mackenzie walks up the aisle and claims to be the father of the bride's unborn babe. As a result Lila and Bishop are married and travel to St Louis, where he presents her with his 5 year old daughter and 12 year old son, children she had not known existed. Together the four travel to Paris, CO where he is sheriff. The story continues as the four make places for themselves in the rough frontier town and work to become a family. I think you will like it. I hope the author will continue the family story by telling us about Gavin's life as an adult."
4,smgssg,Great read for those of us who are hopeless romantics.....I have read this book several times.....I thought the storyline was interesting and it is one of those books I have kept to read again....
4,Lust Conquers All,They let their physical attraction out of its hidey hole and the result was a shotgun wedding. It was interesting to read how the rough edges of these two strangers became smoother as the story progressed
5,Gunfighter's Bride,Gunfighter's Bride:First Class romance..full of adventure and comedy and lots of romance and suspense. Makes you want to keep on reading..no dull moments.
4,darth vader's coffee maker,"This is the coffee maker that Darth Vader uses to brew up a pot of coffee before he oppressing the Rebellion. It looks great. The only draw back is that the coffee is not as piping hot as I might like. This is easily fixed by priming the thermal pitcher with hot water. So aside from this coffee maker being part and parcel to an evil Sith overlord, its great."
2,Took 6 months to kill it,"We owned this coffee maker for 6 months before it finally ""lost it's mind"". One design flaw is the down under programming feature which after flooding itself, no longer works. I will be looking for a side mounted clock this time. We suspect the tank warped and leaked into the bottom; shorting out the electronics.The ""line up the arrows"" scene is irritating too. You have to line up arrows to screw on the lid and the filter basket has to be installed just so. Even if the lid is installed correctly, the coffee ends up all over the counter. The carafe also fails to keep the coffee hot enough, but it's still better than just glass. I am shopping for a new coffee maker right now. Pass on this."
2,Coffee just not hot enough.,"I agree with many of the other reviewers that this coffeemaker does not make hot enough coffee. I have one of those infrared temperature guns so I used it while the unit was brewing. The coffee going into the carafe was only 160'F at the most. By the time brewing was done the coffee in the full carafe was only 140'F (I did not preheat the carafe). After pouring into a large ceramic mug with cold milk in was down to about 125'C - that is barely tepid. After about an hour in the carafe, the prepared coffee was only 115'F - not acceptable.I seem to remember reading somewhere that coffee should be brewed around 200'F for best flavor. Maybe if they brewed it hotter to begin with this would be a good unit.I didn't have any of the leakage or quality problems other reviewers had, but I only brewed one pot total. I'm returning the unit tomorrow. It's too bad because it did make tasty coffee."
4,pretty good but ...,"This is my second B&D coffee maker. I liked the first one better. This one is a fine coffee maker except for the carafe lid has to be put on by aligning two black marks, and poured by aligning two other black marks. Use some whiteout so you can see the marks. If the marks are not aligned when pouring it dribbles all over the place. Another inconvenience is that it has to pulled out from under the cabinets to fill it, unlike the past B&D coffee maker that had a removable water tank (I liked that feature). Other than that I would give it 5 stars"
1,coffee maker,This coffee maker looks nice but that's all. The coffee is barely warm and the carafe keeps it no more than lukewarm.
4,Not the tcm 413,"We bought this to replace the tcm 413, it is fine. We enjoy the thermal carafe and automatic timer."
1,One Star is too high!,"This is the worst coffee pot I've ever owned or used! The coffee is never hot, even right after brewing. After only a few uses the upper section wouldn't stay closed, creating a huge mess. The lid was problematic as well, causing spillage upon pouring. I just purchased a good ol' Coffee Mate and love it(again)! I blew the Black and Decker up in my yard to celebrate."
1,"If you like hot coffee, don't buy this coffeemaker","The overall quality of this coffeemaker seemed only so-so in the store. However, I liked the idea of taking the thermal carafe to the table, so I bought it anyway. I'm sorry I did. The coffee is just barely hot enough to start with, and after 15 or 20 minutes in the ""thermal"" carafe, it is completely tepid. I will not be buying anymore Black & Decker products."
1,Caution ! Basket spring rust and sharp fragment !,I have owned this coffee maker Black and Decker TCM450B for approximately four years and the spring in the filter basket has rusted and a broken piece fell off the top of the carafe into a cup of coffee. Luckily I noticed before I swallowed the sharp rusted metal half circle. I do not have hard water or rust issues and have used and cleaned the coffee maker regulary.
1,Poor Quality!,"I have used the Black and Decker thermal coffeemaker for over 13 years. Good product, great company, so it was a very easy decision to order another when the one I had finally died. The only difference is the all of the previous ones had the stainless steel 'looking' carafe. At any rate, from day one, the water reservoir cover warped from the steam. The coffee filter basket does not close well and finally when you pour the coffee, you lose and spill much of it. You have to be so careful in pouring the coffee not to make a mess. One can chalk this up to user error but not in this case, this is my 4th B&D; coffeemaker of this general type and this particular one is cheaply made. I will not buy another of this brand, too bad really. :-(p.s. I typically do not feel so strongly about a product to write a review, but this is very, very poorly made."
2,Beware of the Dribble Coffeemaker,"I bought this coffeemaker to replace the older version of this. I am disappointed to say that it does not keep the coffee as hot as the old one, and the buttons for setting the time, etc. are incredibly sensitive, so be careful when you're wiping off the counter!!The biggest disappointment is that it is like a ""dribble glass"". It drips all over the counter when you pour from it. It doesn't matter how loose or tight the lid is adjusted. Be advised..."
1,B& D thermal coffee maker,"This is a dreadful product, originally supplied by 6AVE and sold by Amazon and now only sold by 6AVE. The thermal carafe began leaking and we originally thought is was just dribbling when pouring. Then it began pouring--out of the bottom seam and also the bottom. Obviously, the glass insert was cracked. When contacting the seller directly they were not helpful re returning the product but Amazon stepped in and reimbursed through their A to Z guarantee service. You guys at Amazon really know how to keep customers! Thanks.Buyer beware."
2,Carafe great: Coffee Maker Poor,"I bought this machine for the carafe. Since my husband and I get up two hours apart, I wanted a way to store coffee withough burning it. That part of the machine works great. What doesn't work great is just about everything else. The water storage compartment leaks all over the counter. The off/on button broke just after a few uses. The lid to the carafe has to be balance perfectly in order to screw on - hard to do first thing in the morning. If the grounds basket is not snapped perfectly in place it swings open during brewing. Very disapppointed."
2,you get what you pay for,Some reviewers said this was very cheaply made and they were right. Our previous Black and Decker thermal model was made much better. The plastic is flimsy and cheap not at all easy to use. Spend more and get a much sturdier coffee maker!!
1,Defective Coffee Maker,"Coffee Maker was defective. Had to return. Went to store and purchased another coffee maker made by another company. Too bad, I have always liked Black & Decker products.John B"
2,NOT A GOOD CHOICE,"I own several Black & Decker products and have always been happy with them, but I feel compelled to echo other writers. While the coffee it makes is flavorful, it does not get hot enough and the carafe leaks BADLY. Every time I tried to pour a cup of coffee, no matter how carefully or slowly I poured, coffee leaked all over the counter. This machine is definitely going back."
2,Don't buy it,"After owning an earlier model of this unit, one that lasted and lasted, I was so satisfied that I bought the TCM450B no questions asked. What a mistake! When I got it home it didn't even turn on. I packed it up drove to the nearest store that would take it back and picked up a second. I've had it less than six months and it too quit. When it works it's fast. I like the insulated carafe. At the current sale priced now at about $20.00, that's still not a buy if you can't make coffee! If I had one that worked it would get 5-stars. My biggest mistake was not buying on credit and not saving a receipt."
1,"Good Coffee, Bad Carafe, Molten Plastic","The coffee tastes great. Too bad the carafe spills nearly every pour. Whenever I used this coffee maker, I had to make an extra cup ""for the sink"" since it would spill about 1/8 of what I poured.More bad news - today I went to grab my coffee carafe from the coffee maker and it wouldn't move. It turns out that the bottom surface (where the carafe sits) had melted and fused to the carafe. SCARY!I opened up the bottom of the coffee maker and could see that there was only a thin piece of heat shield between the heating element and the plastic bottom. To the untrained eye, it sure doesn't look like a very safe design.Bottom line - stay away!"
3,The book itself is not all that,But my Aunt and Uncle who just celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary are in it! The friends they went to prom with are also in it and are also married 50 years! Gotta love it! I bought this at Amazon.com from an Awesome Deal I found on DailyTool.com.
4,Intriguing and educational,"I read this once for an undergraduate Anthropology class, and never forgot it. It delineates the difference in work ethic and cultural values between the Protestants and Catholics in one South American town, and how they are divided in every aspect. Nothing came down to actual issues of faith, but more on concepts stemming from the religions themselves. For instance, in weaving blankets, the Protestants made lovely, organized patterns which utilized logical color arrangements for aesthetic efficiency. The Catholics used a riot of color in their weaving, producing a beautiful and unique work with each one.In short, this book was interesting even as to a lay person."
3,'rather dry anthropological data...,"This supplement to the ""Golden Bough"", is nice for someone who really is into James Frazer's work. It's rather a little compendium that's nice to have, but it has nothing of the excitement of his original ""Golden Bough"". And it is rather poorly presented and a horrible published compendium that looks like a very poor zeroxed copy of the material. The information is rather interesting for the anthropological data, but rather boring and horrible. The typeset of the publishing is terrible, but, if you're a big fan of his work, you may like the accompanying data."
1,Not too good!!,"I bought this book under the impression that it was a potryal of the life of a boy with autism. Instead, it is pretty much useless chatter by Ian's uncle about the evolution of language. He did not fully talk about Ian until about 3/4 of the way through the book. Buy the book if you want to learn about the evolution of language, but if you are looking to read about autism, save your money!!"
3,"Good book, required for vet tech school","Was my bible in vet tech school, but it was all over the place unorganized to me. If it were more concise and structured, I would sing its praises."
3,Not for new techs!!,Im currently in school for vet technology and this book is very hard to understand at times. I'm just starting out and I feel like I'm reading gibberish! I would not recommend this book if you haven't taken classes on this stuff before
4,Great book for EXPERIENCED technicians only.,"This book is a great source for experienced technicians. It is however, the WORST book for technicians going to school that are beginning to learn about clinical pathology. The chapters were set up fine but the content was info overload (I know thats the point, but im just beginning to go over this subject). Its great as a resource used with other books. This book confused me a lot since my learning style didn't match how the book was written as well as me not being that educated in the subject to begin with. It was not a good book to use in my Clinical Pathology class. But a great resource though."
5,Very comfy!,"No problems with shipping and these shoes look great with everything! I would definitely order a half-size up from what you normally wear, though. Also, they don't stay on very tightly if you need to run or walk quickly (they've fallen off a few times running to catch the bus). Those are my only complaints, though- other than that they are surprisingly comfy and cute!"
4,Where's Mountain?,"This is a great collection, but where is the great Mountain trackStormy Monday, that is on the L.P.?? Check it out if you can finda copy of the L.P., and still have something to play it on."
4,kazan volume 1,"This edgy fantasy is about an 8 year old boy who has seen more than most adults. His clan has been wiped out by a mysterious demon he has sworn to destroy. The beginning may be muddled, but as the story progresses, it will become clear. The dialogue, in my opinion, is scarce but gets the point across. For people who like provocative manga, this is for you."
2,You gotta be kidding me...,"Whoever rates this series anything better than a 5 has certainly never read david eddings, Stephen Lawhead or C.S. Lewis. I struggled through the constant reiteration of the storyline. Yuck! How predictable it gets after a while to rehash the first series over and over. Get on with it! This series could easily have been whittled down to one book without losing a bit of the fantasy."
2,Revisiting the Covenant,"I was in my early thirties when I first became acquainted with the Covenant series, and now that I find myself approaching fifty, I decided to re-read the entire lot of them to see if my perceptions, likes, feelings, etc had changed towards the author and his characters. It is a much more difficult read for me now, as the incessant whining, second-guessing, and woe-is-me'isms, are just far too tedious to wade through.I half expected covenant to end it all after the unimaginable horror of burning the toast one morning."
5,More stars are needed,"Returning to the Land after failing, it would seem, in their quest for the one tree, Thomas Covenant, Linden Avery, the Haruchai, the Search, Vain, and their new addition - Findail, are at a loss. The Sunbane still rains down hades on the land, as if its rays were all the Horsemen of the Appocolypse encapsulated in light. In the eye of the paradox, truth is found, demanding sacrifices that will rend their hearts as it heals them. You'll need a whole box of tissues for the last chapters alone. But the tears will wash your soul."
5,Great Saga. In some ways better than Tolkien,"To those out there who like these stories: Buy and read those six books. You will never be the same, and will wish the Land really existed."
1,not the best martial arts movie,"if u want a good decent martial arts film then believe me there are plenty to choose from....exept this one. what really pisses me off is that producers con people into thinking that bruce lee apperas in so many movies by puting a picture of the kung fu master on the front of their dvds and video sleeves. it seems that the only way they can attrat people to buy or even watch their [bad] films is to put a picture of bruce lee on the sleeve. it should therefor be noted that the only films which Bruce Lee appeared in were enter the dragon, big boss, way of the dragon and fist of fury. you may also find that certain films which show jackie chan on the cover do not actually star jackie chan himself.This film is an example of how NOT to choreograph fight scenes, and how to make a bad low budget...kung fu flick. please if u r interested in martial arts films or want to watch good kung fu, there r LOADS of good ones to choose from.....dont buy this one!"
2,Lets just not complete his unfinished work ok?,"Well I gotta comment of the people who want to view Real Bruce Lee movies to get to know him first from a reliable source and not the Dragon the bruce lee story but a book. Bruce chorographed all his fightin and wouldn't want someone else do it as Yuen Bao. Every attempt to finish his movie or imitate is just unrealistic that people will say ""Hey he is just like Bruce!"" Tower of Death does not have the Bruce quality or realistic fighting scenes. It is made up of acrobatic moves. Unless u want to see that then go ahead rent or buy it. Remember the ""New"" and Tower of Death does not include real footage of Bruce Lee just reminders of other movies(setting & clothes he wore.) Go for a real movie of his. (He made only 4)"
1,False Advertising,"The reason I consider this false advertising is because Bruce Lee's image is prominitely featured on the cover and yet he does not make a live appearance in the movie. His scenes are edited from his other movies. For instance, a scene in which he enters a room is from "" Enter the Dragon "". As well as other movies. It is poorly edited together and the acting is horrendous. I was also very disappointed in the choreography. They fight scenes were sluggish at best. The main reason I bought this feature was because I wanted to see the legendary Bruce Lee choreographed by the legendary Yuen Wo-ping. Unfortunately, that is not the case. I cannot recommend this to any martial arts action fan."
1,"Worse Than ""Game of Death""","The ludicrous ""Game of Death II"" (1981) belongs in a long line of Bruce Lee exploitation flicks that trashed his memory for some quick cash. Apart from a few ""Enter the Dragon"" outtakes (all non-fight scenes), the real Bruce is nowhere to be found. Utterly dispensable."
1,Very disappointed and very ANNOYING!!!!,"Ok i rented this movie thinking that it was another awesome Bruce Lee movie, but NO! it was a movie with CLIPS OF Bruce Lee movies like Enter The Dragon. They even tried to pass it off as a real Bruce Lee movie by dressing up a monk to look like the monk from Enter the Dragon. I think this is very disrespectful to the Legendary hero and should not be tolerated. this is a no rent, no buy movie. i couldnt even finish the movie it was so disgusting."
4,Great.,"The movie is in a widescreen format. The only thing I don't like is that the part where Billy Lo fights the Korean martial artist who challenges him in the beginning of the film - this fight is featured as a deleted scene that must be watched separately. Being that that is one of my favorite fight scenes of all time, I don't like it being cut from the main film. That's why I give this a 4/5 instead of a 5/5."
1,Something fishy,If bruce lee died while filming game of death 1. How is he in game of death 2? Or is he in it?
3,where Bruce Lee dies early then is a stunt double?,"Some of the moves in the fight scenes are trade mark Bruce Lee onesthat nobody else has every really done.It seems the fellow who plays Bobby Lo is replaced with Bruce Lee as a stunt doubleso that get him in without giving him real credit for theshots? If they had really been done by Tong Lung,we would probably seen him in many films after Bruce Lee died.Looking him up he has stayed around, but seems to be a stunt manand character actor and not a lead.Martial arts for films is more like dance than real fighting,where they cut the action to add make-up for blood maybe?I still like the movie with the oriental locationsand costumes: the voice overs are pretty bad at timesbut not as bad as in some Hong Kong Kung Fu movies."
1,What a piece of ...!!!,"First of all, it is very misleading to use Bruce Lee's name and image to sell this DVD when he is not even in the movie except for a few scenes taken from his other films such as "" Enter the Dragon"". Second, the editing is very bad. They did not bother matching scenes from the stand-in's clothing to the edited footage of Bruce Lee. One of the reasons I bought this DVD was because Yuen Wo-ping choreographed the fight scenes. He has done many films including "" Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon "". And a chance to see his choreography with Bruce Lee would have been amazaing. Unfortunately, all you get is mediocre choreography with bad actors. I cannot believe Raymond Chow, the producer of many of Bruce's films would destroy his memory like this. I cannot recommend this to any martial arts action fans. I would give it no stars if I could."
2,Skip it!!,"Ok, listen, I like Bruce Li. Watch his moviesfor what they are worth, and forget all the Bruce Leecomparing. Having said that, this is the 'weakest'of any Bruce Li flick I've seen. Get ""Bruce Li- the Invincible""or almost any other of his movies first if you are going to venture at all."
5,"Great movie, although Bruce is not really in it","You see Bruce Lee for about 5 minutes during this movie. It looked as if they took some brief camera shoots of him, and used those shoots to stick him into the story line.But this movie is still a great martial arts film. The main star is a character that fights exactly like Bruce Lee. His fists are lightning fast and he is able to defeat multiple bad guys by himself.I saw this movie for the first time last week, and I can honestly say that it is better than Kill Bill and better than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."
1,WRONG ITEM SENT,I ORDERED A ACCORDIAN FOLDER AND WAS SENT CALCULATOR PAPER ROLLS. I NEED AN ACCORDIAN FOLDER SOON. PLEASE CORRECT THIS.
1,Doesn't work,I opened up my new RCA CD Player after my Panasonic died (got several years out of that one) and hoping it'd be an improvement. IT SUCKED!!! THe sound quality was terrible and it skipped constantly (jumped to random tracks in the middle of songs). I changed the batteries a few times (even went from my usual nickel-metal hydride to some old fashioned alkaline) and no improvement. Don't waste your money. It's crap.
2,The Spoilers,This one wasn't very good. Even though it has Marlene Dietrich in it and John Wayne. I was quite disappointed with it.
2,Smirk City,"How can a movie at the end of the ""golden era"" with three major stars prove to be a dud. Welcome to The Spoilers. The script is weak, containing some real howlers. Marlene is wooden; her face seems to be painted on. (Would that she had danced and tried to sing.) Wayne and Scott smirk through every scene. Even the lengthy fight scene is poorly done; it's fun to watch the double for Scott appear and reappear in the long shots. Oh yes, and the story was supposed to take place in Nome. See if you can be persuaded that anyone left the Universal set. In short, this is a long, long way from Destry Rides Again."
5,Format of DVD,I would like to know whether the DVD format is COLOUR or Black & White . Amazon.conm shows it as Colour but Movies Unlimitedinfo. is B&W !! I am confused. Please clarify before I decide to purchaseAshoke P. Mahtani/ Calcutta/ India
1,Junk - don't waste the little money this costs,I spent too many hours trying to get this to work. I have to resist the urge to buy without doing hours of research. Read ALL the reviews first.
5,Truly inspirational !,"I've been looking for a native American flute CD for some time now. This one far exceeded my expectations. Recorded in Monument Valley, Nakai and Horn improvise their repertoire against the rock faces of the valley which provide haunting echos; totally insync with the natural elements.Throughout the recording they are accompanied by the sounds of nature - falcons, ravens, wind, thunder, insects, and even a Malamute!This CD will NOT disappoint! Highly recommended. Suz."
3,Good but...,"I agree, I did like Bitten better. The focus on Elena was much stronger, more solid. I can see that the author was trying to introduce new characters into her world, but it didn't go over that well. I think it would've been more fun to do a cleaner focus on Elena or a light focus on her then a deeper focus on the new characters. It was uneven. However, the killer lines still make me chuckle and I'm going to keep reading the series."
4,Pretty good,"Bitten, her first novel in this series, was fantastic. This one is pretty good, but doesn't have the same oomph. Also it is a little repeated from the first novel. But the story line is interesting. I enjoyed reading it and learning more about the main character. You'll definitely like it but will miss the writing from the first novel."
3,Not for me,"When I readBitten (Women of the Otherworld, Book 1)I had trouble getting into the book. I did finish it but my mind wandered during the entire read. It was a good book about werewolves. So I've decided to read the second in the series, Stolen. Like the first book I just can't get into it. It's a struggle to hold my attention to this book. This time I've decided to give up reading it as I don't really know what is going on, nor can I seem to keep focused on it to remember. Everyone that has read these books say they are great but for me, and possibly you, they just are not interesting."
5,Another Awesome Werewolve story by Elena!,A great conclusion to the werewolve storyline. I absolutely LOVE Elena as the lead character. I was actually sad to learn that was the last one about the werewolve pack and started searching for the short stories about them. I recommend:HiddenMen of the OtherworldThe Hunter and the HuntedTales of the OtherworldThere are also 2 limited edition pieces that just recently came out in the last year or so but I have yet to get my hands on them. COME ON AMAZON!!!!
4,Nice surprise find,Once in a while I check out the bargain books looking for new authors. I didn't read the first book but I intend to. I am enjoying this more than I though I would.
2,Not so good after all,"I was really looking forward to this book after reading ""Bitten"" but I was disappointed after all the great reviews. I think this novel seriously lacked tight editing. The beginning pace was incredibly slow and I found it hard to understand why the author thought we needed to hear about the main characters sitting around in meetings complete with typed agenda! I also felt that a lot of the secondary characters were complete stereotypes (megalomaniac depraved tycoon, anyone?). Maybe I have just read too many Laurell K. Hamilton novels, but I expected action from the beginning and a ""hook"" at the end of each chapter to encourage reading on, but the outcome of the plot was never in doubt and the plot mostly seemed contrived and boring.I will reconsider my decision to buy many more works by this author.If you want action from the beginning I would recommend Jennifer Estep's Elemental Assassin series instead.Spider's Bite (Elemental Assassin, Book 1)"
4,Interpersonal Dynamics make this book worth reading,"I have to admit, I was a little disappointed that Stolen immediately jumped into other supernatural beings when the main characters from Bitten are more than enough to sustain several more books.Both Bitten and Stolen are worth reading for the relationship between Elana and Clayton -- probably the most complicated and fascinating relationship to hit fiction. I hope Ms Armstrong decides to continue to delve into their relationship in the future instead of spinning off to other supernatural characters -- no spin-off character in Stolen has any of the impact of Elana and Clayton, they keep you thinking of them long after you have set down the book."
4,Stole-Bitten,"I enjoyed Bitten emensely and Stolen held my attention equally well with the exception of Paige. I found her character utterly weak and pathetic. I tend to like strong female characters and Paige certainly wasn't that. The love-hate relationship that Clay and Elena have in Bitten is wonderful even the progression of their relationship in Stolen is good. I won't be reading any of the following books in the series unless Elena is a main character. There is so much more to be explored in her world and that of the pack. It was a huge gamble to switch from werewolves to witches and, frankly, I believe Dimestore magic and industrial magic to be a waste of kelly armstrong's talents. Especially, when they are centered around a rather weak character. But I am biased. I like werewolves better then witches any day. So if you like witches read on but the wonderful werewolves of Kelly Armstrong stop here for now."
5,Loved It,"A great series. Went to Kelley Armstrong's web site and printed out the novellas about Clay - ""Savage"" and ""Ascension""; and how Clay and Elena met - ""Beginnings"". I have all her books and all her online stories. The characters are fascinating but Clay and Elena are my favorites.Wish more authors would publish short stories on their web sites to fill in background on their characters - a great bonus."
2,broken,"I absolutely loved Kelley Armstrong's first book ""bitten"" and after reading so many other novels I couldn't get into, I decided to buy the whole series. Sigh. A great writer, I think the plot momentum to this 2nd book in the series, somehow lost its way.Mel"
1,Electronic Sudoku Game,"This game was made very poorly. It has many bells and whistles, but most were either not necessary or just did not work. I discarded the game."
1,Piece of junk,"I had expected this game to be as good as a older version that I had owned, but this one is nothing but junk. Don't even bother considering it."
3,...,"Wade and Storm had a great relationship, and their story was interesting to read. However, there were some things in this book that annoyed me.First of all, her hair keeps being referred to as blond and gold, but on every cover of every version of this book, her hair is red. I'd actually rather she be a redhead. Maybe she wouldn't have been so stupid. Some of the things she did in this book made me want to slap her. She was also manipulative to get whatever she wanted. What a great quality to have in a heroine. Not.Second of all, this book was the most boring by Hess. There was so many sections of nothing going on, that I skipped about half the book in total."
5,Finally hardly any entrance themes changed,"The packing maybe a little unique, but this set is the best so far. Only Ricky Steamboat and Don Muraco's music was changed. Demolition and Jive soul bro are in which makes you wonder on the other sets (Wrestlemania, Royal Rumble) why were they changed? Great set."
3,THEY SURE SLAMMED US!!,"THE PRICE IS TOO DAMN HIGH.HOWEVER HAVING ALL THE SUMMERSLAM'SON DVD IS WORTH IT.VINCE WILL END UP SELLING EACHONE SEPERATE ANYWAY,SO WHY BUYIT UNLESS YOU WANT THE COOLER.DIE HARD FANS WOULD BUY IT INA HEART BEAT.I'M GONNA WAIT TILL IT DROPS DOWNTO $50 BY XMAS."
3,Could go either way,"Originally I planned on buying this as soon as it came out. This will be a great product if they keep all the chris benoit footage in. Otherwise the last seven or so summerslams will be chopped up and not be worth owning. I just hope that they leave this footage in, otherwise I will not even think about purchasing this set."
3,Summerslam corrections,"Just to clarify the erroneous information shared by the first two reviewers, the WWF does indeed own the rights and is legally permitted to use the original WWF logo. It is the scratched ""attitude"" era logo that must be blurred out.Also, there are 20 discs in this collection, not more. Summerslams 1988-2007 are 20 events."
4,Must own collection,"I just got this set in the mail earlier this morning. I was worried some if not all of my disc would be scratched like other reviewers have said. Come to find out non of the 20 disc I got didn't have one scratch. I got mine off of the official wweshop website for $167 with FREE shipping, about $8 a disc, not bad at all."
4,"Absolute classics, until the end","Ive been waiting a long time to get some of the early Summerslams on dvd, so I was absolutely delighted when this was announced. And it hasnt disappointed. Great to see the old WWF logo not blurred out constantly, even if the 'word' is beeped out.All in all, its a 5 star release up to about 2002, from there on things get a bit rough, but for any true WWF/E fan, this set is a must"
2,WWE SHOULD BE ASHAME OF THE PACKAGING OF SUMMERSLAM ANTHOLOGY,"I recently purchased The Summerslam Anthology.I was excited to see the first 11 Summerslams which have never been released.When I opened it I was totally disgusted.The WWE has the nerve to charge 150.00 and up to 199.00 {BEST BUY} and the dvd,s are pushed into cardboard sleeves and when you try to take them out the discs become all scratched and ruined.The WWE could have placed each of the 20 discs in a thin line clam shell,but to save money they place them in these cardboard holders and the discs become ruined.What a shame to have a classic dvd set like Summerslam become ruined over the packaging.If you are a collector like myself I would say skip The Summerslam Anthology as all your discs will be ruined when you try and remove them.WWE should get smartScott denny"
5,Off da Hook,Man this album is tight yo man you betta go out and buy this LP man cuz it is off the hook it is worth every penny man
3,great series comes to a rather uninteresting end,"Six volumes in this series, as well as the companion disc ""Club Columbia"" which started this series, gets you a load of 12"" versions never before on CD. Unfortunately, this last volume in the series was really reaching, and lacks a lot of major tracks. Track list:1. livin for the weekend (6:36)2. k-jee (6:07)3. funk boutique (3:50)4. rhythm is gonna get you (7:04)5. precious little diamond (6:48)6. say it's gonna rain (6:45)7.

5,Great take on Raw Gourmet Food,"Raw Food/Real World: 100 Recipes to Get the GlowI love his book- This is a lovely gourmet take on raw food. I have done about 95% of the recipes and every single one turned out stunning. The raw cocktails should also be mentioned, which are great. I did a lot of their recipes when I was entertaining friends who don't have a clue about how delicious raw food is- not a single person noticed they were eating raw and vegan foods-among them some serious carnivours.Personally I would have preferred to have less pictures of the authors- who seem to be on the narcissist site of life and more pictures of the amazing food."
3,Too Complicated,The recipes in this book required ingredients that are unusual and hard toget for the average vegetarian. Out of all the raw books I havepurchased this one I paid the most for and I hardly ever opened it. This was very disappointing because it was expenseive. The book itself is verywell done with exceptional pictures and printing which probably is thereason for the high price.
3,Real world?,"I am very new to raw food eating and am on a crash course to learn all there is to know about it. But I have to say that this was not the book to start with. I thought that the title meant that it would be easy to make the recipes in a real world situation, like the local well-stocked grocery store. Instead the recipes call for ingredients I would have to order online or find in a big city, as well as equipment I might not own just yet. To me, that's not real world.But the recipes look delicious and are beautifully presented. And if you are a serious raw foodie with all the gadgets and a well-stocked raw pantry/fridge, you will likely love this cookbook.But us newbies would do better to start with someone like Jennifer Cornbleet or Ani Phyo. They understand us better and aim their recipes at us, for which I'm thankful. Three stars for beauty, but impracticality."
3,Very Complicated Recipes,"This raw food preparation book is beautifully produced, but the recipes are very complicated and difficult to make. I bought this at the beginning of my raw-food transformation, and attempted to make some of the dishes.While a few were easy to follow, and tasted good, many took multiple days to complete, and did not look at all like the photographs, and did not taste very good at all.Overall, if you have all the ingredients on hand (and some were a bit exotic), and perhaps a chef, this is a useful book. Otherwise, like my copy, it may double as a beautiful coffee table book."
2,"Beautiful people, exotic recipes, but not entry-level","I read this book but was glad I didn't purchase it sight-unseen. I am a newer entry into raw-foodland, and the ""real world"" reference in the title is very misleading. This is the book you want to buy *after* you've gotten your feet wet, committed fully to the life, mastered all the basics, and have the time, equipment, and resources to take it to the next level. Honestly, I found Ani Phyo's book to be much more useful, down-to-earth, and realistic for the everyday cook."
5,Raw and wonderful!,"I read the book cover to cover and began my journey into the Raw Food world. I've actually incorporated many of the recipes into my daily cooking (yes, I still cook) and have seen a difference in my energy-level and my waist-line too! I've shared the book with a few friends who were curious and they said that they made many of the smoothies and were impressed. The main dishes were a bit over the top and probably wouldn't be made in my house for mid-week dining but almost everything else was quick, easy and wholesome. I just finished making the lime, chile almonds and served them diced over a salad that was to die for! Amazingly great!"
3,If you are single and live in a big city-this book is for you.,"If you are single and live in a big city-this book is for you. I have a family and live in a small town, so I would have to look for something else more appropriate for our lifestyle."
4,Good book if into gourmet healthy food,This book has some great recipies but is a little more complex than I was looking for right now.
4,Good recipes even for a beginner,I like this book. It has a lot of recipes that even a novice raw foodist can use. Lots of photos (including authors).
5,Raw gone Gourmet,"I could not give a higher review. The book is beautifully presented, informative, and the recipe's, especially the two gazpachos, are highly flavorful and make you feel good to boot."
4,Not your average vegan fare,I am obsessed with this book! I use it more for inspiration and ideas than for technique as the dishes are quite complicated even without actually cooking. I have made a hand full of the main courses and they have all been delish.Very educational and beautiful as are all of Sarma and Matt's books. It may not be for everyday use but if you are at all intrigued by raw food I highly recommend starting here!
3,"raw food, but not the real world","This book has lots of beautiful pictures that make raw food look really tasty. However, the recipes I made never looked as beautiful as the pictures. I also had a hard time finding a recipe I could actually make. Many of the recipes in this book contain ingredients that are hard to find , and take a lot of prep time to prepare. The recipes I did make tasted good, but due to the time factor, I probably won't be making them again any time soon."
5,Yummy!,"I ate raw at a whole foods store here in Austin, without realizing what it was. It was wonderful, but the thing I noticed as well was I was full, satisfied for the first time in memory. I did not want ice cream or any other treat (as usual). My biggest problem with weight loss is the cravings. I was still not hungry into the evening. when I usually want several bowls of cereal, as I am just not satisfied. I orded this Book and make the Lasagna which is wonderful and had the same experience of being satisfied again(so did my husband) I have been eating raw for a week now and I started at 129lbs and I weighed myself this morning and I am 123lbs. It is so strange to fill ""FULL"" all the time instead of trying to fight cravings. I know the weight loss is just a added benifit. this is so much better for my body, mind and spirit."
5,One of my favorites,"The title says it well, raw food real world. The authors are obviously somewhat extreme to be raw foodists, but they are more ""real world"" than most other raw food books I've read. The authors really enjoy food and the experience of creating and eating. They have the most wonderful deserts. This book has fresh new recipe ideas. The layout and photos are wonderful to look at. This and the Raw Gourmet by Nomi Shannon are my favorites, and they are different enough that you need to own both."
4,Nonsensical people!!,"Well.. I ordered this book as a creative guide into raw foodism after reading all the reviews describing the MILLIONAIRE you have to be to afford a dehydrator. Well I ran across more than a couple today for around $60 so I must ask: If you cannot afford such a device.. what in the world are you doing buying this ""expensive"" $25 cookbook?So with my new dehydrator, I will actually TRY the recipes and get back to you."
2,Not really the real world of raw food,"I got this book because it is my friend's favorite but I haven't yet made a recipe from it and I bought it in August. I understand this is a great restaurant in NYC and maybe I'll get there one day. But I'm not too impressed by the book, sorry to my friend."
2,"Not practical, way too time consuming","This book is beautifully put together, but wow WAY too time consuming. It's been sitting on my shelf for years now because the recipes are too complicated. This would be a good book if you were planning a fancy dinner party and wanted to show non-raw eaters that raw food can be better tasting than they think. But for day-to-day recipes, this is not a great option."
3,a bit much,"The book is beautiful. The authors are beautiful. The food looks scrumptious, but unless one has their own restaurant the recipes aren't very feasible. If you are interested in the gourmet side of raw foods, which includes ridiculous food combining and elaborate processes, this book is for you. Although raw, the recipes aren't necessarily nutritious. I can understand going to a raw foods restaurant and rationalizing mixing sugar with protein with starch, etc, but this is not a book to base ones health regimen on.For the occasional fling this is fine. For the long term I recommend Living In The Raw by Rose Lee Calabro, or Anna Marie Clement's book which you can get directly from Hippocrates Health Institute. Her recipes have proper combining built into them so the job is easier. They're not ""gourmet"" but they're easy, tasty, and nutritious. Granted, there aren't pretty pictures of pretty people and pretty food on every page but there is definitely more for the money."
3,Supplemental... if you have the time,"I rented this book from the library, and I am glad that I did. The book is somewhat misleading by titling it ""real world."" A lot of the recipes involved too much time, too many ingredients, or ingredients that were too hard to find. My real world does not leave me time to spend hours in the kitchen....Overall I would not recommend this to someone just starting out, but it might be good for someone with a lot of time, and who has knowledge of the raw world already."
4,Real food for real people,"I carry this book with me where ever I go, I cannot stop reading. The recipes are easy to make, and best of all they are delicious. My husband eats them as if he were starving, and even requests I repeat certain favorites. A most excellent starter recipe book into the wonderful world of Raw Food."
3,"Great but not really ""Real World""","This is a great book with a lot of helpful information. I also really enjoy some of the simpler recipes, such as the ones for nut milks and smoothies, but I don't think that most people in the ""real world"" have either (a) the time involved in prepping, or (b) access to some of the esoteric ingredients that many of the recipes call for. Still, I'm glad I have this book and about half of the pages are good and dog-eared from repeated use."
1,Buyer Beware,"First let me tell you something I am Bunny Wailers biggest fan!!!!! But do not buy this dvd unless you just want to add it to your collect because you are a fan. This is the worst dvd I have ever purchased in my life the quality is the worst. Sound, clarity and I could go on and on..."
3,listen,"if your a reggae fan captived by bunny wailers music, then i could see buying this- i want to know about the legend, im going to find what i can. (he speaks for awhile on this one) the recording sucks though."
2,needs improvement,There were characters from the book that wasn't in the movie and I was disappointed by this. It was fairly close to the book and I still enjoyed watching it but the book was much better.
3,carolina moon,A decent made for tv movie. The story was good but a bit choppy. It could have been a bit more smoother from scene to scene.A clarvoinant woman is haunted by the death of her best friend's death. She moves back to her childhood home to make a new start.
4,Carolina Moon - the movie,"This is a story created by Nora Roberts. It concerns two friends, Hope and Tory, who are young girls when the story opens. Tory (Victoria) Bodeen, played by Shea Keebler as a child and by Claire Forlani as an adult, has an abusive father Han (Shaun Johnston) who is a religious obsessive. Tory has psychic abilities and when Hope Lavelle goes missing, Tory knows she is dead and where the body can be found. This ability has got her into trouble previously. This murder proves to be one of a series of killings of young girls and Tory's father is an obvious suspect. Hope's mother, Margaret Lavelle (Jacqueline Bisset) holds Tory responsible for her daughter's death and only the intervention of Margaret's daughter Faith (Josie Davis) and son Cade (Oliver Hudson) help heal the rift. It's an engaging thriller and very well worth watching."
3,could have been better,"I bought this movie because I had read the book and was so excited to see it played out with real people. I was a tad disappointed but My husband didn't read the book and liked the movie. I would recommend renting it, and not buying it."
4,Long book but worth the while,Bought this book for my in law since he loves to read. He mentioned for me to give it a whirl so I did. Great details from a woman whose life itself was under a microscope.
3,White House Diaries,"A little samey, same in spots. I was more interested in the inner working of a first lady rather than what she wore and who was interesting and how proud she was of her husband, but I guess thats what a diary is!!! I'm no critic."
1,RC Tugboat,"This tugboat worked great for about one week. Then for no known reason it reduced its speed to 10%. After I asked for repairs,the company graciously accepted the boat back with a full refund.The boat was such fun I have re-orded with the hope that the next boat will last longer. Call me an optomist."
1,Horrible...don't waste your money.,"My seven year old is absolutely obsessed with being a ship captain since we came back from our cruise. He really wanted a remote control cruise ship, but since I couldn't find one (for under $3.5K at least) he said this looked like fun. This RC tugboat did not even last an hour! It started listing pretty bad and the pump that fuels the water cannon completely flooded the hull. Do not waste your money. To make matters worse, the boat continually runs, with the power to the boat turned off as well as the remote...and of course you get a nice shock when trying to take out the battery. HORRIBLE TOY!"
1,Bad quality and dissapointment....,"Don't buy this tug boat!! I recieved this to give to my son for his birthday and it left him in tears. He put it in the water the first 30 mins after having it and the motor would NOT turn off by the switch or the boat when he pulled it out of the water. There for we had to open it up to un-hook the battery so the motor would not blow up. My son was so anticipation to get this, but was let down and left him upset. I read the reviews and it all says it, that the motor will not turn off. Reluctantly I took a chance, but regretful now. I strongly advice it NOT TO BUY this product!! Mom and dad's nightmare as a gift."
4,An awesome blend of Jazz and Chill,"This is a wonderful album! It's chill enough to read by and interesting enough to work by. The album is composed of samples, and Neris really has a good ear. Take a listen, get the album!"
4,nice but came damaged,this product is very nice. it looks great! mine came damaged. i decided just to deal with the damage rather than have to deal with sending it back and waiting for a new one. some of the coating was off of it and the metal was rusted on a few areas. i just painted it with some black paint... its not perfect but it will work and is better than dealing with the hassle of sending it back. the bottom does seem a little unsteady and does wobble a bit. i would recommend this too a friend but would worn them of possible problems. the maker should probably do better quality checks on their products.
2,Cheap,"Theitem shipped on time but did not come with all the nuts and bolts. From a distance it is pretty but the pieces fall apart and it is not at all sturdy. We were able to reinforce it with additionalnhome made materials, but I'd rather spend a few more dollars for quality next time."
1,THIS MOVIE STOPPED THE SERIES DEAD IN ITS TRACKS,"WHEN AN ARMS SHIPMENT IS STOLEN IN THE PHILLIPINES, INTERPOL CALLS IN ROBERT MALONE [FRED WILLIAMSON] TO INVESTIGATE THE CASE. THE FIRST TWO FILMS WEREN'T EXACTLY GOOD FILMS THEMSELVES, BUT AT LEAST THEY WERE SOMEWHAT ENTERTAINING. THIS IS UNBEARABLE! HORRIBLE ACTING, POOR PLOTTING, BORING ACTION, AND BORING VILLAINS MAKES THIS THE WORST OF THE BLACK COBRA SERIES. IF YOU REALLY LIKE FRED WILLIAMSON, RENT OR BUY ''ORIGINAL GANGSTAS'' OR ''THREE THE HARD WAY''."
2,OK but old,"unfortunately Gai-fu, Feng chose to describe very difficult ancient chinese terms with the hip language of the mid 70's. This slang was silly back then and extinct now. Most of the language is not used and groovy is just not a way to translate ideas."
5,The first album,"This album is very good, the sound is like a record of the 80's but is all great, is not the best album of Daniela, but you must have this cd!"
3,"Early musical, ok, but plot does not really hold up","The quality of the print and sound are both reasonable given the age of the film. The plot is very clumsy. Fortunately the villain has a mustache so he can be easily identified. The high points, and what make the film worth watching as far as I am concerned, are the shots of movie cameras, early sound equipment and movie projection equipment. The production numbers are ok, but not as good as what is present in later films. Alice White is good. This is an early musical -- watch and enjoy it for what it is, even though you may cringe though some of the more clumsy parts of the story."
4,Flavor of Brazil,"Everything of bossa nova is here in this CD. It includes six songs composed by Jobim. Supported by a cast of singers and musical artists Sarah Vaughn, Milton Nascimento, and Heloisa Buarque de Hollander (a.k.a. ""Mucha""), Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter (sax), Paul Desmond, and Stanley Turrentine."
1,Cheap and see through,I have many other Splendid shirts and this one does not meet the quality that I have come to expect. It is cheap and see through and not worth this high of a price!
3,Not His Best,"Like putting a wild animal in a cage, putting Albert Collins in a studio suppresses his natural exquisiteness. Mr. Collins was a hard driving, soul piercing blues guitarist who excelled in front of live audiences. He's not Ashlee Simpson. In this studio album his awesome power is watered down somewhat.It's still a good CD. If you like it, then get one of his live albums, but make sure you have something to hold on to because it may very well blow you away."
4,I ain't drunk...or am I?,"In spite of the title,this album burns-master Collins delivers a better than exquisite performance that puts a lot of today's guitar players to shame.Supported by a legendary band featuring the Uptown Horns,Albert Collins was making history,one lick at a time..."
4,"Good stats book, but no CD","The book is easy to read and a good reference book on latent variable modelling, however, the paperback did NOT come with the CD. I bought it new from Amazon (using Amazon Prime) and the CD is not included."
3,James Last Dance Dance Dance,"This CD is just snippets of songs, you could call it a sampler. It is def not one of Last's best."
3,"beautiful, but....","I love the size and quality of these hoop earrings and would have given them five stars based solely on their appearance, but the ""secure joint and snap closure"" is not secure at all. I've already lost one earring because the closure is so difficult to fasten."
1,DON'T BUY.,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM.WHEN I ORDERED IT IT BROKE EASILY.I PROMISE I AM NOT LYING.ALSO THEY ARE NOT EXTRA LARGE.BE SURE NOT TO BUY.
5,I love it,I got this as a present from my husband and I loved it. I have no trouble at all with the hinged post secure snap closure. As a matter of fact I think it would be more difficult to pull the hoop apart to slide the post through the snap end. But if that's easier then do it. I love these earrings. They are sexy.--From the wife.
2,101 is a sampler for those afraid to jump into the Fishbone catalog,"Just buy Fishbone's s/t record, In Your Face, Truth & Soul, and Reality instead of this. This two-disc set really isn't worth the money considering there's several (inferior) demo versions of ""Lying"", ""Modern Industry"", and ""Party at Ground Zero"" wasting valuable disc space. 101 is definitely a sampler for those afraid to jump into the Fishbone catalog. With all the songs spread over these discs, there sure is a lot of filler. I suppose Columbia doesn't want to give Fishbone soldiers bang for their buck. There's no way that ""Love and Bullsh*t"" and ""Scrooge"" can compete with the simple synth beauty of ""In the Air"" and the ""Many Millions"" which is just as good as ""Fight the Youth"". Like I said, if you've never bought Fishbone before and like the audio clips here, take the plunge and buy one of their first four studio LPs."
4,A good collection that misses too much,"This is a nice collection, but be warned that CD2 is mostly rare tracks and B-sides that might only be of serious interest to Fishbone afficianados.CD1 is a mash up of most of their early work and hits.So, here's the rub... You miss some of the best songs off ""Truth and Soul"", a great album, as well as ""The Reality of My Surroundings"". Both albums are worth owning in their entirety. This compilation is like reading chapters of great novels.For the cost of this CD, you could score both CD's used, and have enough left over to maybe even squeeze in Chim-Chim's Revenge.I think Bruce McCullough said it best: ""Best of albums are for housewives and middle schoolers"". The used CD's are cheap, and you get the offbeat tracks as a bonus.Fossil Fuelin' is a great addition for the Dedicated Fishheads, but as ""collection"" in one Jewel Case fails miserably. Which is great, because you can just go get the real albums."
5,An concentrated wisdom book,"After reading conversation with god 1,2,3 and friendship with god, whice each one of them gave me an deeper insight, this book finally compound all the wisdom in the other books. I think that if i read this book before i read cwg 1,2,3,4 then i would not agree with it's ideas. The place that i've been, before reading this book , was THE place to read it. this is the most satisfying book in this series for me. ENJOY !"
1,Interesting...,"As someone who works for a hotel which has housed the ""Conversations With God"" seminars, I can safely say that the author of this text is amazingly rude for someone who claims to speak to God. Remember Mr. Walsh, the Divine loves all people, even those underlings who work the front desk and arrange your overpriced 'classes' :)"
2,"Big Disappointment, Devoid of Authenticity","I really loved all three ""Conversations with God"" books, so it was really disappointing to read this dry, repetitive, pedantic, simplistic, egotistical book. It looks to me like this has really gone to NDW's head, which isn't surprising I guess. The other books had the ring of authenticity. Whether it was ""God"" or not talking, who knows, but the spiritual teachings therein felt right, true, real. This one has NONE of that. Sure, it has some good 'truths' in it, but nothing you can't get with a lot more juice and fun and sense of wonderment in the original three books. I see others love this one too, what can I say. Was flat and full of Walsch's considerable ego to me."
2,Communion with God,I've read many of Neale Walsch books and just loved them. Communion with God was way over my head. Complex book to read and identify with all the mumble jumble.Put the book down after several chapters of reading.
1,more new age shallowness,"As I began to read this book, I was thinking, ""what is so new about talking to God""? Not a new concept. As I read more I realized much of the author's assumptions about God are based on poor research of various faiths and a blending of incompatable teachings. However, this is of no concern, since in the author's view, all of us are God. In his view talking to ourselves is talking to God . And since most people talk to themselves already, I don't think they need to buy a book telling them how."
1,Untruth,This is from the man who said in an earlier book that Hitler was not evil because he released the Jews from their physical bodies so they could ascend to a higher level. Why trust anything someone like this would say? Why think it is from God? Any theology or worldview that denies the existence of objective evil is false and dangerous.(...)
3,"Good, but not the best in the series","I read all books by the Author (or God!) and some of them become my bed side companions. But I must say, although this time the book is written as if it was by God, this one is really written Mr. Walsch, and I think Don is in danger of losing contact with himself (or should I say God) and put on too much of his eago.There are valid points in this book. But if you find this book lacking, try CWG book1 and and FWG. I am a very shap observer, I read all religion, and all sicence books, and almost all best sellers read like junk to me, but, except for some of the claerly marked commend by Don, I have found the God's section extremely inspiring in those two volume.Don't dismiss the entire series because of this one ... this one read like one of the best seller by an author who must publish something to keep his name in people's mind. Not that bad a book, but don't give it out as a gift just because of the author's name ..... unless you will."
5,"An amazing, powerful, life-altering book",This is the best work since CWG Book 1. The book's message -- that we are all connected and that we are all one with God -- is delivered in an incredibly powerful way. The final chapter is one of the most inspirational and empowering pieces of writing I've ever read. I highly recommend this book!
4,"OK, but lacks compared to Will Shad's books","This book starts off well,in the first few chapters, but then goes into repeatng the same stuff from the first books of the series. I would reccommend Will Shad's 'The Truth' and 'The Whole Truth' if you want similiar, but slightly different, material. Neale seems to be running of things to say, and so he repeats the same stuff."
2,Good but.....,"Communion With God brings home the major points of the CWG books. That confirms each of us are One and we can certainly make a major difference in our own experience and of the world also, if we choose to.Points are repetatively introduced from many different perspectives. Which makes the reading tedious once you get the point. For this reason I gave the book only two stars."
2,Blah blah blah,Too much psycho-babble and not enough real life advise. It was a chore to get through it when what I really needed was a swift kick in the pants! Turns out that dumping my zero of a husband was the best thing I ever did - and I just went with my gut. I guess I was looking for justification - turned out later he was a drug addict! Duh! Sometimes we just need to listen to God's voice directing us and that's good enough!
1,Not what is shown!,Bought this and it is not what is shown in the photo. Comes in a white box and does not appear to be an actual Sony product. Sending it back!
4,Some of the best songs of an era,"This CD represents Ray's masterful interpretations of the best songs of an era, and I would encourage collectors and music lovers in general to add it to their collections. This is the kind of CD that is very high in quality of sound and stereo effect, and is perfect for sharing an evening with someone you are close to. Soothing and romantic music."
1,Awful.,"This book was terrible. I was told it was good so I started to read it, but I found I could barely finish it. I don't even read mystery books and I knew who the killer was in the first twenty pages. The ""heroine"" of this tale (I use this term very loosely) was boring and uninteresting and frankly also kind of easy. The other characters in the book weren't much better. None of them were developed past a name and physical description. The action sequences were bumbling and the subplot confusing. There were some good ideas in this book but the author never took the time or energy to develop them. It read like someone's leftover brain storming ideas thrown hastily together. Don't even bother with this book."
2,Fair....Bordering on Ho-Hum.,"This is the fist Hall book I have read. I don't think I will be reading anymore. I was a little bored with this story. Things were ok until characters Emma and Norman entered. They are so weird, that the story lost its substance. I got tired of the cockroach riddles and stories. Adding Jennifer to the duo just made them that much more uninteresting. I'm not sure where Alex's political friend was supposed to fit in the story. It seemed like a chapter from another book got mixed up in this story. I would have preferred more follow up with the murders than all the dialogue between Alex and her Alzheimer ridden father. That got a little old.Thank goodness this was a library book and didn't cost me anything."
2,"Solid Finale, Poor Prelude","Though he assembles a plot with a lot of possibilites, James Hall's downfall in Body language comes in the area of character development. Put simply, the author tries too hard in creating these characters, all of whom are indescribably complex. There is no way to get a handle on anybody. If he would have backed off a little bit, the characters would have become more believable. The finale was solid, but maybe because I was so glad to get there."
3,Kindle version,"I enjoyed this book as I do with all of Mr. Hall's books even having to wallow through all the misspellings etc. Whoever ""wrote"" the kindle version must have been on 14 year old on a crackberry."
3,Heavy frame,This frame is okay if you want a tabletop frame. Ours fell and shattered. It is very cute but you have to have it in a safe place. The picture size is tiny so make sure you will have billfold size pics - wallets are too big.
4,Does not include the long versions,"This is a decent enough collection of the Chambers Brothers best but there are two songs which had great extended album versions: ""Time Has Come Today'"" and ""New Generation."" The original album which includes ""Time Has Come Today"" is still in print and can be ordered in cd form. Unfortunately, the ""New Generation"" album is not in print. Therefore, the ""long"" version of that song is hard to get. I loved the Chambers Brothers and I used to buy their albums in vinyl when I was in high school. I also used to see them perform live. I would play the great long versions over and over. Here, the collection is great but the versions included are disappointing. The cd still gets 4 stars for great performances by a great band."
1,Where is the long version???,"Without the long version of ""Time Has Come"" how can this be the best of the Cambers Bros. Was very dissapointed. Pass this one up.Look for the long version."
4,Raw metal/punk crossover,"I love the style and sound of these guys. It is truly their own. It is cross between rock, metal and punk. The songs are full of energy with simple, catchy riffs. The gruff, but unique vocals fit perfectly. This is their debut cd, but their second cd is even better. Unfortunately, they have split up."
1,what?????,"All I can say after reading NowhereMan is what the flying ****was that about? The story is horrifically overwritten. The similes and metaphors are distracting and forced, and the story (ies) are unintelligible. How did this book get published, never mind win awards?"
2,what's going on?,"what's going on at our newspapers out there? the village voice, the san francisco chronicle, the chicago tribune, & the los angeles times all picked this as a best book of the year! what pretentious people are getting and abusing these critic positions with their artsy-fartsy lack of perspective? i've about thrown in the towl on listening to our critics nowadays. it seems they're trying to see that i get punk'd rather than find a good book to read. as other folks here on amazon have stated: there is much fine writing in this book (much better than i could do, thank you), but that does not make this a worthwhile book. the narrative is simply all over the place and organized in a way to guarantee annoyance. though i enjoyed many parts of this, in the end it went straight into the ditch and i was left feeling completely unsatisfied. all said and done, a waste of my time."
5,Best novel I've read in years too,"This is a brilliant book. If you like Nabokov, you'll like this too. I didn't understand the last chapter either, but I'm not sure the flaw is the author's."
5,Exposing psychological insecurity,"Bosnian immigrant Jozef does not find his own place in US. He is an intelligent, sensitive and cool guy, but he feels empty inside. The mouse which comes into Jozef's dream in the beginning of novel is similar to Josef himself.Hemon mentions mouse three times in association with Jozef (guy of 1990s) and Russian immigrant (of much earlier time). He tries to expose deep down suffers - psychological insecurities of people (at least these 2 people), who left their countries because of war. Hemon seems wants to tell that, regardless of their intelligence or power, people in such condition always have deep down worries and he compares it with the feelings of mouse who has no place to go and no one to help."
5,"Good product, great price.",Rec'd a good product at a great price. Less than half the cost in the computer store.
2,Not a classic,"I purchased this book thinking it would be along the lines of the Aesop fable. It is not. The story reads like The Little Red Hen with the lion asking who will help him remove the thorn from his paw and all the other animals replying they are too busy. The mouse does remove it in the end but that's it, No moral no comment. Not much for your child to take from this book."
4,The Lion's Paw,"As described, this book is simple to hold and read. The cover and the inside drawings are cute. It will be donated to the children's library soon."
5,Still Funny After All These Years,Most of the stories in this very short and very funny book appeared in The New Yorker...almost 70 years ago(!)Great humor is indeed timeless. I recently re-read this book. The other reviews listed here say it all.It is impossible to read this book and not laugh out loud.
4,The Education of Hyman Kaplan,Although this book was written before the IInd world war it is still relevant and one of the funniest books I know. I read it over half a century ago and on rereading was not disappointed. The Author pokes fun at the efforts of new immigrants to learn a new language but never becomes spiteful or condescending. And since this century is one of mass migration it is still relevant.
2,Very basic book,This book would only be a good reference for beginners who have NO knowledge of armwrestling. I wouldn't recommend it just because a person can research WAY more info off the web by going to armwrestling message boards..
3,"Good overall, not very much of George!","I bought this film because I am a George Clooney-aholic. It's very simple to see in this film that they've released it just to bank off his stardom. There's even a separate trailer on this DVD that semi-features George...it's called the ""George Clooney Trailer."" I'm not even sure he's in the other one at all. He's probably in the film a total of about 4 minutes...if that. And he certainly does not play the woman's ""boyfriend."" Basically, he wants her but she wants her husband.Overall, I enjoyed the film. I thought it was a great story about how you can be unhappy with your life and change it to be happy. She has a very free spirit in this film...her children love & respect her when she loves & respects herself. This is a great film if you're feeling down about your life...sort of like therapy without the big bill!"
1,So awful it's good?,"This film is probably THE worst film ever made, it had everything; boom mics in view, camera crew in mirrors, bad script, bad acting, ridiculous plot and never ending side boob from the old leading actress D:If you're a fan of bad films (just so that you can laugh at and ridicule them) then here is the jackpot... The holy grail. This film had my friends and I crying with laughter at how bad it was but it will also fill you with a deep sense of shame.... It's THAT bad.I'd give it five stars for sheer hilarity but in all honesty? half a star... But you can't actually give that rating on here, shame."
4,Most reviewers are blithering idiots,"This is a welcome addition to the Jordan fans. I cannot understand the blithering idiots praising JRR Tolkein for finishing when from beginning to end, Hobbit to Return of the Kings took THIRTY YEARS. If you want to restrict it to Lord of the Rings, then it only took 13 years. Grow up you children who have never had an original thought, much less written an original line in your lives. I want to encourage Jordan to finish his series. All I have done is put it all on hold (while buying the books) until he (or his ghost writer) finish the series.As to this book, I feel it adds to the WoT series and I for one am sure he has worked out his denouement for WoT and needed to lay the foundation for it with this multiple book prequel (if you believe all of the rumor mills about what Jordan has ""said"" in some discussion group).Happy reading."
4,Also Try,Love reading phantasy novels? Do yourself a favor and read Steven Erikson's Malazan series. Gardens of the Moon is now available in the U.S. Or you an order the entire series from Amazon.co.uk
1,"jesus christ, such trite fantasy","I decided to read this book before I started the Wheel of Time itself, and I am very happy that I did not start that series. The christian ideals of good and evil are so overdone in fantasy books that I am considering going back in time and killing Tolkien in his African homeland. Seriously, do not read this novel. George R.R Martin's song of ice and fire is such a better series."
3,"I liked it, but again, why was it made?","I've read Legends, and was actually quite disappointed that it was just a bigger version of it. Now, with that said, I really did like it, and would recommend it to anyone who hasn't read Legions or is curious about getting into the WoT saga.Now, why I only rate it 3 stars is, he's milking the damn series for money. This story would have been fine to read if he released it AFTER he was done with the main stories. I have a quote somewhere when he started the series saying it would last 5-6 books. Were on #10, it looks like it will go on another 4 or five, and while he still has TONS of plotholes in the story. The real question I have is why? And yeah, maybe everyone is being harsh on Jordan, but come one, everyone has been waiting for something HUGE to happen the last couple of books, and he gives us a PREQUEL? does that really add up in your head? No, it really shouldn't."
5,Took the plunge!,"Even though they've been reccomended to me about a million times I have resisted picking up a Robert Jordan book because I just didn't want to start a series that is already ten really fat books long. I'm not a huge fantasy reader but did recently reread Lord of the Rings and was looking for something else like that. When I saw an ad for New Spring that said it was a sequel and an entry point for the Wheel of Time series (and, only 334 pages and $22.95) I thought I'd give it a shot. It kept me up way past by bedtime because I couldn't put it down. If New Spring is any indication of what the rest of the series is like I have to say Robert Jordan deserves the hype. I am definitely looking forward to reading Eye of the World."
2,Enough is more than enough,"Tolkien once wrote that the only criticism of the Rings he found mertorious was that it was too short and it was.Robert Jordan obviously was aware of this and took it too literally. Loved the first 5 or 6, but the plot and quality is degenerating rapidly.If one believes the Biblical prophets and is watching the news there is a strong possiblity that this world will descend into chaos before Jordan redeems his world.Come on Jordan, finish it up with one more book of the quality of the first few. Promise I'll try your next series if you do."
1,new spring,"I suggest TOR changes the title of the series from ""Wheel of Time"" into ""Waste of Time"". I accept that in verry long series such as this, the people do not change much in their behaviour (My father still plucks his beard and I have a photograph from when I was 15 years old where I sit and chew my finger just as I do now at age 48) but that doesn't mean RJ has to descibe it all in boring detail.A consise version of the series including this book would be bulky enough but verry usefull.New Spring does add something; but not for me. It only adds to the revenues.I stopped buying the books after book 8. If I jump from there to the last book (when will that be???) I doubt I missed much except a lot of straightening dresses etc etc.No, I suspect RJ had this lying around and hoped to placate the reader and turn the library-reader into a buyer.I am not placated and will not buy."
2,Ho Hum....Still waiting,"Well I finally got around to reading this one. No surprises. It didn't explain anything new, answer any questions, or really fill in any gaps. At least not to me. But, that may be because it has been years since I read the first book in this series. If the author is going to write, prequels or sequels, that's fine, but finish the story that was started a decade and a half ago. There are thousands of storylines which can be developed into thousands of books just from the sheer scope of this series. But, after over 15 years and about 8,000 pages later, I'm beginning to wonder if the Wheel is going to turn, ages pass, and the series come to a conclusion before the author dies. I also doubt whether there are going to be any readers left to buy any of those off shoots after being burnt out on waiting ad infinitum for an end to this story."
4,doesn't QUITE make it to Book 1 of Wot...,"I would have given this book a five star rating, but for the fact that the plot leaves you still hanging as to how Moiraine actually found Rand (or am I missing that from one of the other books in WoT?).As for plot, it really moves right along--no ""dead"" moments in the read. As Moiraine and Lan are the only two viewpoints in the book, there is a refreshing lack of characters to try to keep track of. Though I know many who would disagree with me, I personally found a prequel to be a nice addition to the series. I loved the extra perspective into Moiraine and Lan's characters, as well as Siuan!, overall would highly recommend this book even to those of you who have given up reading the newer books. Relieve the good 'ol days when RJ really captured the reader with a hard to put down story that you wanted to talk about over and over with your friends."
1,Only for suckers,"Who would read all these reviews, and then actually buy this book? This book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population...the suckers...of which I am obviously one, because I did read the stupid book! It took me almost a year to get through it - one half paragraph at a time before I would fall asleep each night. If it wasn't for Jordan, I'd have a hard time going to sleep at all. It doesn't even deserve 1 star."
4,Starts to Answer WOT series Quesitons.,This is a very interesting book to read. I would suggest that you read this book after reading the first 7 books in the WOT series. At that point in the WOT there is questions of what happened after the Aiel War in the dark and hidden secrets of the white tower and the Black Ajah. Some of these questions need to be answered to help the overall WOT series to move forward. Dependent on direction of the next prequel books these question maybe answered whick will allow the WOT series to continue to its conclusion. So take the time and enjoy the WOT series and the prequels. We will have to wait and see.
2,Boring Prequal,"New Spring, is... different to say the most. The only interesting part of the book is the perspectives of the story line. I did like the way Jordan Robert used perspectives of characters' rarely used before. Getting to ""know"" the characters minds is the only reason I would read this book if I've already read the rest of the series.The book is about Moraine and Siuan finding the Dragon Reborn. Really the story line isn't very interesting. In the start a foretelling says that the Dragon is reborn in so many words.It is an okay book and I would still read it, but no new plot elements are introduced and I would rather read the end of the series than a prequel. The plot is already moving too slowly in the series. I suggest reading New Spring anyway, especially if you've not read any of the Wheel of Time series."
1,Opinion of RJ's new book,"Good book - more of Lan would have been nice.A question: when is Jordan going to finish the rest of Wheel of Time? As one of the reviewers below wrote, it appears that Robert is out of ideas and is stalling."
1,A Jordan and Tor Publishing Rip Off,"I cannot review a book that I have no intention of buying...What nerve for Jordan to release this prequel to a novel that he hasn't even finished...to think of all the time he wasted writing this instead of moving ahead with the novel...I'm sorry, but anyone who purchases this fits right in with P.T. Barnum's old addage: ""THERE'S A SUCKER BORN EVERY MINUTE!""...Jordan has turned into a greedy and selfish hack who has no concern or loyalty to the many readers that made his books a success in the first place...Too bad they do not allow giving 0 stars as being forced to give it 1 star makes me ill!"
1,More filler,"RJ has lost his magic, this book continues the decline we have seen in his last few books."
5,Amazing,"The majority of other reviews I have read are dissatisfied in the extreme. With these, I have no choice but to disagree. Robert Jordan's skill with the English language held me from the beginning to the end, to the point where I would stop and laugh over the clever descriptions and techniques Mr. Jordan puts to use. ""New Spring"" is a brilliantly written tale, brimming characters bound to honor and the blade, the decieving charm of evil, and tensions waiting to break."
3,"Worth reading, but not as good as the other books","I have to confess that while I found the first 7 books of the Wheel of Time impossible to put down, I didn't experience that with this book. It was a good story, and a must-read for any Wheel of Time fan, but it's not in the same league with most of the other books. Worst of all is this nagging feeling...why is Robert Jordan writing prequels when he could be finishing the series? This annoyed me constantly while reading the book and it detracted from my enjoyment of the book. I would rather have seen the next book come out sooner than read this."
3,A good book but bad timing,"After reading almost ALL of the 2000+ comments on this book Idecided to be fair to R.J. and read the darned thing before I condemned it.I have to say that I did enjoy the book though Moiraine & Suane'sescapades reminded me an awful lot of Elain and Egwane(Please pardon me if I misspell these Bizarre names) BUT...The Prequels should be published AFTER the main freakingstory is done! The thing I most enjoyed about the book wasthe little peek into the ""Foretelling"" of the Dragon's rebirth.to which R.J. has vaguely alluded for so long. Also, DarlingCadsuane made an appearance. I just Love her! Now I must alsoconfess that I did not spend 10 or 20 dollars on this book, Ibought it second hand for 6 bucks. So if you need a WOT fix goahead and read this book but don't throw good money away on it.By the way, anybody want to buy a THIRD hand copy? lol"
1,Why do i keep buying these books,Thats what i have been asking myself since path of daggers. Please end this series soon Please stop with the torment
1,No Shame,"Robert Jordan has finally proven beyond a doubt that he has no shame. I truly pity the poor fools that have paid money for this reprinted crap. There is nothing here that hasn't already been printed years ago in Legends! Bob, do us all a favor and please go away, you lost the ability to write long ago and you aren't fooling anyone. Fanboys, it is over, it ended with book 5 and it will never be like it was. There are a ton of authors out there that still care, RJ just isn't one of them."
3,Good background,"This is a must read for WoT fans in my opinion, having the back story to show how Siuan and Moraine got hooked onto the trail, and why they were the main ones. Definitely recommend reading but this book severely lacks the detail that is vested into the other books in the series. Part of my interest in the Wheel of Time novels is that there is extensive details regarding the societies and people, whereas New Spring focuses almost entirely just on the storyline. The only societal details that are provided, that are lacking in the rest of the series, is some information on the Borderland traditions, maybe a little more on Tar Valon's back story, and some more information on Moraine--reducing how 'mysterious' she is portrayed in the rest of the novels.Definitely worth reading, but just understand it's a short read meant to make Moraine and Lan seem more like people--it's not going to provide any huge revelations."
3,just ok,"After reading all the other books in the series and enjoying them, I feel that this is very Wheel-light. It is good to know how Moraine and Lan got together, but really not enough for a whole book."
4,Quite Good!,"This is a wonderful introduction to the beginning of the WoT series. Jordan does a great job of pulling us into the story. As the story unravels, we also get to discover a few new things, making some future events make more sense! It is a little slow-moving at spots, but I'm impatient. I'd recommend this book to any Robert Jordan fan!"
3,A Little Disappointed,"I was eagerly awaiting any new book in this series, prequel or the continuation, and when I got this one I read it in a day. I was hoping for completely new material but what I found was that Jordan had enough backstory written during the other books that he compiled the already revealed story and some notes into something else to publish. I got the impression that he was throwing us crumbs to keep us from complaining that the next book is taking so long to release."
4,Far better than Book Ten,"After painfully following the stagnation of the Wheel of Time series in the last few books, I was glad that Robert Jordan came out with ths fresh prequel. It lends insight into the past of many of the main characters and manages to recapture some of the excitement of the earlier books. One could, with reason, accuse Jordan of milking a commercial success (as David Eddings has) with endless prequels and sequels and adventures had by peripheral characters. At the same time, for those of us who appreciate the enterprise of constructing a rich world full of well developed characters, this kind of offshoot from the main project is entertaining and well worth the detour."
2,FAN TIRED OF BEING RIPPED OFF!,"ROBERT JORDAN SHOULD REREAD HIS FIRST SEVEN BOOKS.THEN MAYBE HE'LL BE ABLE TO ADVANCE THE CHARACTERS AND STORY LINE TO IT""S RIGHTFUL END.WORD TO THE WISE RJ ;STOP RIPPING OFF WHAT READERS YOU HAVE LEFT!"
2,Is this a test to see how far he can push his fans?,The saddest part is that in an interview that he gave years ago he said that he has had the ending of the series ready since day one. It just seems so pathetic to me that he is dragging this series on seemingly to test those of us who have been reading since the beginning (joyfully through 1997 and painfully since then). I feel like a drug addict in that I know that the book is going to be crap but I read it anyway because I hope that it will be as good as when I first started.While this is not a bad story and almost seems like he is getting back to his original style it really ticks me off that he came out with a prequel (which I of course bought and now feel like I am just encouraging him to drag this out as long as he can).
1,Robert Jordan or Martha Stewart?,"This book is garbage unless you like chapters of descriptions of room decorations and fashions. Wheres the story? Theres barely a couple of paragraphs mentioning what is the whole reason for the book, and the rest is all about what the women are wearing, or what the decorations are in each room they are in, in horrible monotonous detail. In between we are treated to the interpersonal relationships of the women in even more boring detail. Its a soap opera. I put the book down after reading half. I am disappointed that I even spent money on it. Unfortunatly the Wheel of Time series has turned into the Ladies Home Journal for the feminist dominatrix interior decorator fashion lover."
1,Please stop buying this crap,"Bad enough that he did not finish the series, but now he wants you to pay to read prequel."
1,Please wrap it up,"I agree that Mr Jordan should not be releasing sequels before the series is finished. What's next, special edition re-writes of the existing books?"
3,As a long time WOT and Jordan fan,"There is only one thing left to say:""Robert, Pleeeeaaaaaaassssseee! Please, please, please, please finish it...... please???"""
1,Please Write an End-Quel,I feel like I've been run over by the Wheel of Time as I'm going on Decade #2 of reading the series and am literally now back before the beginning. PLEASE end OUR misery!!
2,Bored....,"When I first picked up the Eye of the World, I didn't know what to expect. I was captivated by Jordan's smooth writing style that keeps you turning pages. As I progressed into the series into books 6-7 I felt Jordan needed to wrap it up soon, he was getting long winded and the story wasn't going anywhere. So I figured I would just wait until the end of the series to pick it up again. But Jordan wants to milk a cow that is out of milk. From the reviews I have read on amazon.com I am not the only one thinking Jordan should finish the series in 1, 2, 3 books at the most. I think the reason it sometimes takes him 2-3 years to write a book is that he is out of ideas. So he writes a short(by his standards) prequel to hold the reader of. He now numbers 2 or 3 prequels but the end is still no where in site. Do yourself a favor, save your money, wait until the entire series is finished, then buy the entire series."
1,I was shocked,"I have stuck with Jordan for year after year after year. I have collected all of the WOT series in hardback. Like many of you I have grown very bored and disillusioned by the direction the series has taken. Needless to say I was dumbfounded as to why when we are all hoping for a dot on the horizon to show us that the end is near, here comes a _prequel_???? Unbelievable. See you in 2 years."
1,Prequel?,"Someone obviously didn't see what happened with the 3-part 'prequel' to Star Wars. RJ, you're a great writer, I love your books, but whats the deal? You getting paid by the word or something? Finish the darn story, THEN worry about a prequel, thats how it works!"
1,Why?,How about finishing what has become a overly-bloated series before starting a three book prequel!
2,Full speed reverse!,A novel idea. A prequel to a series that has not been finished yet. Wow. All i can think is that Mr. Jordan only has eyes on his check book and filling it faster. Or perhaps he wants to turn WoT into the new Mack Boland series with hundreds of sequels and a never resolved plot.
3,"Great paced read, but didn't cover much ground.","I really enjoyed the pace of this novel, as it kept me from putting the book down. It is well written, in the spirit of RJ's earlier WoT novels, but unfortunately doesn't really cover too much ground. I was left wanting more of my questions answered, and more of the holes in the gap between this novel and ""The Eye of the World"" to be filled. It is a great read, but it just does not contain enough information or cover enough time and events to make a proper prequel. Check it out, if you want a little more info about Siuan, Moraine, and Lan in their younger years."
3,Good but not great,"Unlike a number of other reviewers I see nothing wrong with Jordan writing this book, however, like most reader I have been increasingly disappointed with the last couple of WOT books (#10, Crossroads of Twilight being the worst). This book is definetely better then #10, but in my opinion it still has way too much flowery detail and not enough plot, i.e. it not on par with the first 4-5 books of the series."
3,Moving forward,"Although Short, New Spring provides the conclusion that you expected. Unlike the last 2 books this time you feel like the story moved ahead. This book brings back reminence of the first 2 books and gets you excited for the next book. You have to read this one if you have read the others."
3,Its been done,"If you are familiar with the series this adds very little to either the plot or character development of the Wheel of Time (WoT). The story, while interesting, has been recycled from other places either in whole or in part. It does serve as a way to introduce characters who appear later in the WoT and position them in the background but this seems to have limited value.It seems that Jordan has lost his way with the series and perhaps he seeks to go back to the roots as an effort to get back it on track. The books have become complicated beyond belief adding characters and subplots to such an extent that they have progressively slowed the story development in each subsequent release. At least here the author has a defined goal he is heading toward, the beginning of the series proper, if only the end were as clearly in sight. This was the wrong book for Jordan to be writing, it is the Hobbit and what he needed was the Silmarillion."
1,"Stop, will you?","I believe it was purported that Robert Jordan had the ending already pictured when he started writing the series.For someone who already has the ending in mind, you would think that a prequel might be something that you may want to consider after FINISHING THE ORIGINAL SERIES?Or has the author forgotten to mention certain details that we need to know? For someone who has written over 1,700 characters (historical and present -- yes, it's true, COUNT THEM), you would think that he had all his bases covered.Or maybe the emperor has no clothes.Get on with it, Mr. Jordan. If you have seen the ending, then write TOWARDS it."
1,Finish off the story,"Please, Please, no one buy any more of this guys books until he finishes off his Wheel of time novels. What a ripoff. Years we have waited for an end of to a plot started over 10,000 pages ago, and he can't seem to finish it. NO MORE RJ until he finishes what he started!@@&^(*#$^"
1,say what?,"This was a surprising book, in that i expected to find out more about: the boys and the village, Lan, and more clues about the past, etc.Great potential, little follow through.At least somebody died."
1,James Fenimore Cooper JR,"Having been thrilled with the Sword of Truth series I opted to read A Wheel of Time.This book was a disaster. I couldn't make it past chapter 3. Every third word was an unexplained term AND the characters doings lacked any sort of motivation...Of what value is a story with no context?I don't know, ask this author's editor...In short I am reminded of James Fenimore Cooper, lots of fluff but no content.If you are going to start this series don't start with the prequel."
1,Yawn,"I have to admit, I didn't make it past the cover. It was by Robert Jorden. QED it was pointless and endless. So why start?Fortunately I abandoned ship around book 8. I'm sorry I left it so long. You too can leave this hapless author behind.I sympathise with authors who do not have the skill to finish a book or series well: I despise this author who appears too scared to even try!PS. There is no other author alive whose book I would leave feedback on without reading it first. Says something about RJ doesn't it?"
1,So sad...,"I read all of Robert Jordan's books, and even when he releases his next book, I will buy it and read it. But this book is just a reprinted story that they are charging more money for. If you want to read it, just buy Legends."
1,Another disappointment from RJ,"I swore that I was giving up on the WOT series after Crown of Swords and probably should have quit before that. I simply got tired of reading 500 pages where absolutely nothing happened. Two weekends ago I found hard covers of Winter's Heart and Crossroads of Twilight and an 11 CD audiobook of New Spring, The Novel in a discount store's cut rate discount bin. None was more than $5.95.That alone should tell you everything you need to know about where RJ belongs. All I can say is, ""What a disappointment."" Unless you find these in a discount bin like I did, save your money. I am convinced that if his characters were real the wise women would take RJ out behind the shed and beat him silly.Very little entertainment value here."
1,Finish the Series First,"Mr. Jordan is off on another tangent again. I started to read the series right after the second book came out. This was over 10 years ago and still no end in sight. I suggest that readers find an alternative series to read, one which is complete or will be completed soon rather than committing to over 10,000 pages of rambling. The first book was one of the best fantasy books written, but they continued to loose steam until they became unreadable.If Mr. Jordan needs the cash, I suggest he writes a synopsis of the first dozen books, so people like me, who have complete lost the thread can catch up."
3,New Spring,"I'd read all the books in the Wheel of Time saga and the short novella in Legends before reading New Spring. I believe this novel, compared to some of his earlier Wheel of Time works, is not as interesting and plot-ridden. I expected more development in Moiraine and Siuan as Aes Sedai, and was let down at its abrupt ending. The book was, contrary to Jordan's writing style, narrow and short in scope as it did not span that long a time period. I also hope any more prequels will further elaborate on the hunt for the Dragon Reborn we were all so anxious to go on, rather than focusing on politics and the meeting of two minor, albeit important, characters."
4,Again?!?,"I enjoyed this book, and I enjoy the Wheel of Time. I do agree with many that the last few books have been pretty bad, and don't move along at all.This book, however, explains many things I wanted to know (the test for Aes Sedai) and fills in details about things only hinted at.It's nice to see firsthand the search for the Dragon from Moiraine's point of view, to see how it all began and came to pass. Maybe it's just another marketing scheme, but at least this book was worth buying."
1,New Spring,"I wholeheartedly agree with the previous reviever Chuckyb.I so enjoyed this series for years. So much so that I went back and bought them all in hardcover and re-read them several times.That was until a couple of agonizing chapter-novels ago when I realized this would never end. What's with reborn-ing all the killed off Chosen? Who's who now? I bought the last one a year ago and never read it, the dissapointment would crush me. By the way if you had read them all Chuck... you would know Rand is a son of a runaway Andoran Queen and an Aiel buck."
1,"It was good, the first time it was published in Legends!","Robert Jorden has provided with more Proof the he has sold out. My advice to all the other Jordan readers out there is to stop reading now. He will never finish this story and it will probably never go anywhere further plot wise. Go read the ""Song of Ice and Fire"" series by George R.R. Martin, they seem to actually be going somewhere and get better with each new book."
1,sad,"It's hard to believe that after 10 progessively worse books, there are still people who will give a prequel novel a good rating. Despite the fact that there may be a change of pace in this book, it can't, in any way, redeem the fact that this so-called author has managed to waste thousands of pages with completely useless text. It is people such as him that cause the rest of the literary world to have little or no respect for the fantasy genre. The end could never justify the means of this series. Taking entire novels to supposedly build up the suspense is the mark of a charlatan. He's only after one thing at this point. Stop giving this man a chance. You'll simply find yourself having lost precious hours as well as your money."
3,"OK, but I would wait for the paperback version","This was a very short book for Jordan, and it did not add a lot to the series or additional insight into the characters. If you want to read it, wait for the paperback version."
3,a glimmer of hope?,"I read this book based on some of the other reviews, and frankly, I am glad I did. Like many fans of the Wheel of Time, I have been bored senseless by the last couple of books. I had no intention of buying the next Robert Jordan book until I had read it from the library. I took a chance on this one simply because it was going back in time. I believe it works as a standalone book, but it is also an enjoyable insight into the history of Robert Jordan's world. It isn't great. It isn't the 'ripping yarns' that the early WoT books are, but it is a fun and easy read. It's main use from my view, is that it gives me some hope that the rest of WoT might start to return to the enjoyment given by the early books."
4,Enjoyable and fills in a lot of details,"Filled in a lot details and questions brought up in the series especially the relationship regarding moiraine and lan. They brought up the aiel war in the beginning, although they never really got into it, so was a little disappointed in that, since I always wanted to hear about that and maybe even some stuff regarding hawkwing's time, but >_< thats just me... Finished the book in one weekend so I wish it was a little longer since it brought up almost as many more questions than answers."
4,Nothing major,"It's an addition that you don't really need, but it is interesting. You'll find out the past of Moiraine and Lan, my only beef is that you're interested in their past while reading the series, not at the end of the series. Wish he would've taken time finishing the final books and left this one for Brandon to put together, but it's not a bad read at all."
2,Good but useless,"This is a good book, a nice little quick romp through...whatever the land is called. However, why a prequel?? All the fans care about is the continuing adventures of Rand and company. We want to see it end. A good book, but Robert Jordan should've waited until after the last book to publish this."
2,Dissapointed,"While I like the Moraine character, as I read this book I kept wondering when something would actually happen. It was nice to get a glimpse of the character's before they assumed the roles that we know them for, but we barely get any actual conflict until the end of the book. This is such a stark contrast to Jordan's earlier books which were action packed and yet still maintained the intrigue that got us hooked.I hope that he can manage to regain the passion he had for this series, because it's been harder and harder to get through the last couple of books."
4,An excellent prelude to Wheel of Time,"Although portions of this story appeared in the Legends anthology, Jordan has added to the complexity, and most importantly, the characterizations in this new version. We are finally treated to Morainne's early years as an Accepted as she learns that the Dragon Reborn may soon be born.This novel acts as a perfect precursor to the Wheel of Time series. I would recommend reading it before the actual series if you have not read it yet. If you have read the series, beware, reading this will cause you to want to re-read the entire series!"
1,aes sedai are sooo boring,"the first chapter was awesome... lan gearing up for a battle, there's suspense, there's a promise of action, i was excited to read more. i'm halfway through the book now and it's been nothing since but morraine and siuan chapters... what is robert jordan's problem? why spoil a great fantasy series with chapter after chapter of catty females, i don't understand why i still read this author."
1,fyi,"Just for everyone's info the ""reader from Washington"" is actually Robert Jordan commenting on himself. Check through the reveiws and you'll be able to tell it's him."
5,I just Finished.,"I just finished the book and it's wonderful. If you are a WOT fan, I would suggest reading this book. It fills in a lot of details that are only hinted at in the other books.If you are a Wheel of Time fan you should read this book."
1,BEWARE! Read Editor Review from Publishers Weekly CAREFULLY?,"Robert Jordan has shown us he loves to drag a series out until his loyal fans are pulling their hair out in fustration, as we ask ourselves when will it ever end?As we are all waiting for the end, Robert Jordan does a Prequel...I spotted a phrase in the ""Editor Review from Publishers Weekly"", It states:""Jordan's eagerly awated prequel to the Wheel of Time, the first of a projected three,""God no! Robert Jordan is doing times 3 prequels before he finishes the main Wheel of Time series. So there is still 2 more prequels or another 4 years, before Robert Jordan starts to thinks about how he will finish? or 12 Plus of the Wheel of Time series....LMAO as I cry in fustration."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!!,Unbelievably good - I could not out this book down. Read the book BEFORE you review it. I have read it twice since I purchased it. It really starts to fill in a lot of the missing pieces of the puzzle. I highly recommend this book.
2,"Too Little Plot, Content","This is really a short story barely expanded to novel length. There really isn't enough content to justify a novel, although it is interesting in adding to the history of Jordan's world."
2,Longest Short Story I've ever read!!,I did not read the original short story - but this is obviously 300+ pages of a short story. the last few pages are edge of your seat reading. The preceding pages are like watching paint dry. The same Hackneyed phrases and the same repetition of bogus descriptors really makes this read a slog through the mud instead of a walk in the park.My recommendation - USE YOUR PUBLIC LIBRARY. Do not pay for any more of this drivel!!
1,I will not read it Mr. Jordan.,"I will not read it on a train.Crossroads of Twilight was pure lame.I will not read it in bed at night.Winter's Heart did so bite.I will not read it, on a boat.Path of Daggers lodged in my throat.I will not read it Mr. Jordan.I am done with Wheel of Time boredom.I was addicted, early on.The first few books were great fun.The Eye of the World was mighty fine!The Great Hunt was sublime.The Dragon Reborn, A Shadow RisingBoth enjoyable and suprising.But after that the books get worseUntil now I am forced to write this verse.(As bad is my verse, your books are worse).You have lost it Mr. Jordan.And so I type this here warning.So that others can be learningthat your books are not for readingbut for bonfires and for sleeping."
3,Gonna be nicer than the other guys,"I'm a huge Robert Jordan fan and this book was very good. However, the series is long, and has a tendency to drag on. but the end is in sight. Robert Jordan has announced that he will complete the series in 2 more books, making a total of 12, and number 11 is due out in October. Also, the other prequels won't be written until after the main series is completed. Finally, he's heard his fans.As a stand alone book New Spring is better than many of the books in the main body. But it's not as good of a place to begin if you're unfamiliar with the series, as The Eye of the World. The reason is that the book assumes the reader already knows how the power works, whereas, in the main series, you ease into it.After years of loyalty to the Wheel of Time series I'm impatiently awaiting its conclusion. But I'm so hooked to the story that, no matter how long it takes, Robert Jordan cannot lose me as a fan. THE SERIES IS THAT GOOD, even if it is a bit long winded."
2,A boring prequal,"New Spring, is... different to say the most. The only interesting part of the book is the perspectives of the story line. I did like the way Jordan Robert used perspectives of characters' rarely used before. Getting to ""know"" the characters minds is the only reason I would read this book if I've already read the rest of the series.The story is of Moraine and Siuan trying to find the Dragon Reborn. Really the story line isn't very interesting. In the start a foretelling, a prophecy of future events, says that the Dragon is reborn in so many words.It is an okay book and I would still read it, but no new plot elements are introduced and I would rather read the end of the series than a prequel. The plot is already moving too slowly in the series. I suggest reading New Spring anyway, especially if you've not read any of the Wheel of Time series."
1,Out of ideas,"At one time the WOT series was my favorite series of all time. Now whenever I speak to a person who wants my opinion on a series they should begin I tell them to stay away from WOT. I beleive Jordan is out of ideas and he is dragging out the story. I will read his next books just as I read this book; sitting in a bookstore with my coffee by my side. I will no longer be fleeced by Mr. Jordan. ""New Spring"" is better than his latest two books, but I can not understand why Jordan refuses to finish WOT. The only thing I can think of is that he is out of ideas. His ship has run aground with this fantasy fan."
3,"Read ""Eye of the world"" first","Hell read them all first,then go ahead and read this,i finished this last night,and although entertaining...dosent add too much to the story began with the first novel....i would recomend it because it is ""the wheel of time"",but not neccesary to enjoy the rest of the series,the first one hundred and fifty pages just lead up to moraine and siuan becoming aei sedai,one chapter is devotied to them leaving the tower and entering a village,nothing happens,just loads of detail about the different people who frequent Tar Valon,and thats basically how the restof the book goes,although i did enjoy Elaida ""helping"" the accepted with there training(wicked).....try it for yourself,just dont hope for too much....Enjoy"
1,STAY AWAY!!!,"I wouldn't recommend this book for any former fans of the series (which I know there are many of you). I also wouldn't recommend this book for any person looking to start the series either. This book will destroy the sense of mystery of the Aes Sedai which made the EOTW so enjoyable. Instead we get more of the same, bitchy, whiny, sniffing Aes Sedai. Heck, I'd say stay away from WOT period!! Robert Jordan needs to focus on the continuation of the series, not write prequels."
1,Don't waste another penny!,I've purchased the entire series over the past few years for my wife who loved the first few books then read the rest for some strange reason while complaining the whole time about the anticlimactic plot. I've invested a small fortune in the series and refuse to waste another penny on this author. Just read the other reviews - I get a real kick out of them - everyone says in plain english that RJ is a complete waste! If you want to be a sucker - then go ahead!
4,A Fun Read,"""New Spring"" reminds me of why I started loving the Wheel of Time series back when I first made my way through ""The Eye of the World."" This is a fun, quick read, with plenty of action and a nice, quick plotline. It is, in short, a refreshing change after the glacial progress of the last few Wheel of Time books. While certainly exciting for devoted fans of the series, this prequel still is accessible to newcomers. Its plot is self-contained, and while it certainly gives old fans new insights on characters from the main series, no knowledge is prerequisite to enjoyment or understanding of this book. Don't hate this book without trying it because of Jordan's recent less-than-stellar works: that's ridiculous. Look on this as what it probably is--a fun novel that Jordan has written while he recreates the life and vitality that he will hopefully infuse into the remainder of the Wheel of Time."
5,Good book,"This was a fun book to read. I'd probably give it 4 stars, but I'm trying to make up for the dorks who gave it 1 star without even reading it."
3,Great book....Could have used a little more cowbell,"hell of a good read, but i gotta be honest. This story needed more cowbell. This last one is even better then the first."
1,What the heck was this?!,"I read the book. Mildly interesting but a completely unnecessary detour.I wish Jordan had applied the effort in writing this book to FINISHING THE SERIES!!Now he has passed away and someone else is ""finishing"" it. I anticipate disappointment. Who can match Jordan?I will try and forget this series exists.(heavy sigh)"
2,"love Moraine, you will love the book","While it was refreshing to avoid the deluge of new characters and sub-sub plotlines, the book forcibly reminded me that Jordan is still firmly in ""stretch-mode,"" milking this cash-cow for all it's worth.If you were hoping for something out of the Age of Legends or the Two Rivers characters... sorry. Jordan does throw in a couple of tidbits about al'Lan, but his part remains relatively small. However, if you like the women putting each other on pedestals and shopping... that remains a core element of this book, and you will be well satisfied."
4,A Glimpse of the Past,"New Spring reminded me why I started reading the Wheel of Time series in the first place. It's nice to be reminded how well Jordan can delvelop characters when he's only dealing with a few, rather than the 624 he's been dealing with in the last couple of books. Although this is an extension of the novella Jordan wrote for Legends, I found it refreshing and I hope he can head back towards this style with the next Wheel of Time book."
1,Too much pointless detail,"My theory is that Robert Jordan is an obsessive compulsive who stopped taking his meds about 10 years ago and needs to start again. Or perhaps it has just gotten out of control and he needs to go in for treatment. Mr. Jordan, get help. You were once a great story teller."
1,Enough is Enough Already,"Waiting 2 plus years for every new book is bad enough, but now instead of continuing the series he writes a prequel novel. Its bad enough trying to remember what happend 2 years prior when you read the last book. I can remember getting into the Wheel of Time series. It was book 4 of a expected 6 book series. Now there are 10 with no end in site. Jordan incredible skills for telling a story are now being wasted. The last couple of books have held alot of fluff and you find yourself on the edge of the seat saying ""get on with already"". If the prequel was released after he completed the main series I would have been piping a different toon. But for now I don't expect to spend my money or time on a prequel."
1,Unbelievable,"Hmm, a ""prequel"" even before he finished his current series. I hope the people reading this don't buy this book. I'm under the impression he doesn't know how to end his series. What a bunch of baloney!"
1,How 'bout you write an ending??!!!,"You know I agree with a previous reviewer - we're not really reviewers - we are merely folks who used to be happy passengers on the Wheel of Time train. Now though it becomes clear that Jordan's Wheel merely refers to this money factory that this series has become. He has no intention of finishing it but will keep grinding along until he drops. Want to know why Tolkein was such a genius? Because he FINISHED HIS STORY. For crying out loud even Donaldson finished in 6 books! This guy is ridiculous, this series is now ridiculous and I am out of here. Who's with me??"
2,Why do I bother??,"Jordan's latest in a series that seems destined simply to be rather than entertain has forced me to take a hiatus from him. I got this for Christmas but instead went with a newcomer, Brian S. Pratt who wrote an engrossing book called The Unsuspecting Mage.How can a new writer instill more intense feeling of excitement in me than a veteran such as Jordan? Maybe Mr. Jordan can take the time to remember what it means to be a reader instead of a writer and once again, write to entertain!!!"
1,El Dorado,"Jordan is a genius. 15 years ago he enthralled us all in with a strong opening to the only decent fantasty since Tolkien. Since then he has led us on the search for El Dorado, with us all hoping to find the city of gold, the fantasy story of epic proportions, as he wraps up the series. There were the early ones to discover the truth, but for many more of us it took until now to truly understand. Jordan has lost his way, and now the laborious journey of his latest books is far more costly than any reward to be found at the series end."
2,"Not bad, not what was wanted, but not bad.","As a book, it's typical of Jordan's writing. The same cliches exist, the same problems with his writing style, the lengthy and unnessecary prose, but other than that it's a good book.It's not the NEXT in the series we are all waiting to finally read the end of, and it's not even the next book before the end, nor does it lay any new groundwork. All it does, is attempt to cash in further on the WOT series and milk more cash from the cow.Note to Robert Jordan. The cow is almost dry. Your readers are becoming irritated with the story and are turning elsewhere for entertainment, notice declining sales figures and read between the lines. You have alienated your readers, get back on track, and they MAY return."
1,Same old same old,"As an entire novel, this is better than his last novel; however I would have given that one zero stars if I could.As an addition to his Legends short story, this is defiantly not worth the price. The back-end of this novel (the original New Spring) is fairly engaging; the additional pre-prequel is not.The politics are boring, the description of every object to minutia is mind0numbing and the characters are the same cookie-cutter characters that fill Jordan's other novels. I think I would have rather had the unemotional Aes Sedai where I could imagine their inner-thoughts then find out that they share the exact same emotional maturity as all of Jordan's other unimaginative female characters.Do not buy this novel. Buy Legends instead and enjoy the quick-read of the original New Spring along with some other excellent short stories."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This book is just more of the same pointless filler I have come to expect from RJ.It really is sad. I was a HUGE fan of the WoT after the first 6-7 books, but Jordan just lost it. I had a great deal of hope for this new book, but unfortunatly it didn't deliver.You could read 4 chapters from this book and come away with all the interesting and entertaining plot information.Dont waste your time or money."
4,A Fresh Approach,"Since Book Ten, reading the Wheel of Time series has become more of a soap opera. Chances are, some one could read nine, skip ten, and when eleven comes out, still be on track with every one else.This prequel was a fantastic delight. Finally going to the past of Moiraine and Lan was an unexpected treat for me since I did not know such a book was in the works. All in all, I am looking forward to see if Jordan is going to make another since there is still about seventeen years to go before the pair find the boys in Edmond's Field.If you are looking for the dynamics that were present in the first set of books from the series, you will not be disappointed with this one."
1,Just make sure you buy it on sale.,"If you are not already a Jordan fan, DO NOT become one. At least not until he finishes the bloody thing. If you have already been sucked in, do yourself a favor and buy it on sale, because you know you are going to buy it. I'm still not sure it was worth the $12 I paid for it. But then, books 7-10 havent been either. If you have read the short story as it was published in the Legends book, then you have already read this. Oh a little tidbit here and there, but nothing of use or substance. Its an ok book if you have a couple days to kill and nothing else to read. But if you read it and are disappointed, you have been forewarned. And if you read it and think its the greatest thing since sliced bread, well, I'm sure that its best I not say what I'm thinking. Until the next book...."
1,"Unfortunately, not very entertaining.","Robert Jorden has written in way too many inconsistentcies into his series. I truly don't believe he remembers everything he's written himself, and he has begun to betray his own characterizations. It's all very distracting, and makes for an ultimately unsatisfactory read."
2,A Disappointment,"I was really disappointed with this production. Bujones was quite good, but I felt that the rest of the cast were second rate. However, my biggest irritation was the audience. They were intrusive and very loud, wild applause as soon as one of the principals appeared which continued during the dancing, usually culminating in whistles and much stomping of feet completely drowning out the music. Why couldn't the DVD production people at least reduce the noise, or wait until the dancing had finished? I doubt that I will watch this DVD again. The two stars are only for Bujones' dancing."
1,...Keep looking!,"This book is terrible. Some of the older releases of these books are very racist! I find it interesting that if you dream of a black man or black person (refered to as a negro p.399), that you will have bad luck... (what [junk])!If you want a reall Dream Dictionary, *HUNT* for ""The Dream Book"" or ""Dream Dictionary"" by Evad Aras. This is the best dream dictionary I have ever used in my life..."
3,Disappointed,"My wife and I spend the first few minutes of our morning describing our dreams to one another and I thought this would be a fun gift, or at least a great stocking stuffer. Before making the purchase (at Barnes and Nobel) I invested a minute to read the back cover of the book and scan a few pages, and believed that this was a book describing the meanings of symbols and further dream interpretation; however, this ""reference"" book was written to interpret symbol meanings so one could fortell the future. In my opinion, many of the examples are just plain rediculous. But, I am not a believer of this pseudoscience so in all fairness I gave it three stars because if you are looking into the future telling business than this book might be of interest to you. Good luck. As for my wife and I, we had a good laugh and I took the book back to the store."
3,Deal or no deal,"This was a good deal; the wall charger is super fast, but the car charger is one of the only types made for blackberry and it quickly breaks. If you don't mind buying one every now and then it's okay, but if you want one for long term look for one that has a solid molded peice at the base where the wires connect to the piece that plugs into the phone. If it turns at all, it's not going to last-- at least mine didn't and I've have a few."
3,"Clip Does not work with Katana II, everything else seems ok","Just wanted to give a heads up that the clip is useless for a Katana II phone, the chargers seem to fit fine if you aim the arrow down.Bought mine from bargaincell for about 6 bux, so I guess I got my money's worth."
4,Good fast review of Pathophys. 4 days before exam!,"As I said, 2day I passed my Pathophys exam due to this book. It's really good and made me understand sooooo many principles that i've never understood before. That's a really good one but i give it a 4/5 rating cause the book is quite expensive."
3,"Chimpmonk's Music Video, Cool!",I haven't seen the movie but this mini production has me convinced to see it. This music video has catchy little tune interlaced with clips from the movie. Definitely a good family oriented animation video.
4,Alvin is great,"SHow was funny and had the kids rolling. Alvin is always up to his troubles, they were great. More like this would be great."

1,Silly,Not very clear and just really silly. My kids weren't even that into it and they usually love things like this.
4,Keeps my 4 yr old happy,My four year old daughter loves this video. She periodically watches this when I log in to my Amazon account.
3,"nothing spectacular, but not bad","The video lost my 3 yr old's interest fairly quickly, may be more suitable for older children. I also expected it to be longer."
2,Alvin Chipmunks How we Rock and Roll,I am not happy with this at all. Did at play righ at all. Just not good. It was not want I expected and my grandkids did not like it at all.
5,Alvin and the Chipmunks,Just fun for the kids to watch. Wish the video was longer. you should post the other Alvin and the chimpmunks videos
2,"Good content, super slow stream speed","Chipmunks are very cute. My daughter loves it. However, the streaming speed is super slow and stop for several times during less than 4 mins show time. Instant video is not that ""instant""."
3,Alvin an the Chiupmunks,Did not care fot it. For me it was a waste of time. I will keep it for my Grandson to play.
2,Not that great,Perhaps I was expecting a replay of the original Alvin recordings and was not thrilled with this new attempt to use the name to sell a not that great video.
4,Entertaining!,Short and fun to watch! Something that you are able to let children view without worry! Don't think twice about viewing this video!
3,"All natural, but scented!","I bought this detergent because it was recommended on the FuzziBunz website. You are supposed to use detergent free of dyes and perfumes on the cloth diapers, but the Ecover has lavender scent added. The product smells great, but is not okay for my daughter with sensitive skin. We chose a scent free, dye free herbadetergent from Vaska (on [...])."
4,Life is short,"This is the new rock revolution. This is how rock and roll sounds today, right now. All time is circular: we are in the repeating moments of now. If it is not broke, why fix it? Why add keyboards? Why write about a kid named Tommy? The Soledad Brothers are about excitement. Sometimes they play with Meg White on drums. They are part of the rock and roll shrine based in Detroit right NOW! These are people who know who Mississippi Fred McDowell and John Lee Hooker are. All songs need a beat. All songs need to rock hard or they are meaningless. Why record in the studio with a bunch of suits starring at you. Rock and roll is an experience that cannot be captured, oh yeah! Johnny Walker is one of the most captivating lead singers in rock and roll. This CD is a document of that. ""Teenage Heart Attack"" sounds like they mainlined some exile on main street. ""Up Jumped The Devil"" is like rockabilly blues. This is party record. Get it today."
1,extremely let down,I scoured the pages to find what I need for batteries for this silly device and the only thing I could find was that it needed a 9V battery. Then upon arrival right on the box it states it needs some r/c charger pack? No where to be found of course which is why I rated everything with 1 star because how can I give it more than that if we can't even find a power supply to use it!!?
2,No batteries included,"I had hoped to be the cool uncle this year by getting one of my nephews this car. Come to find out, he could not even play with it because it did not come with the batteries. I looked and looked but could not find anything about the batteries. This made me so mad. I felt so bad, I went to the store to find the battery and they did not have one so I bought him something else instead. What a mistake it was to buy this toy."
4,Continuation of Ed McBain's 87th Precinth,"Though not a good as the TV show, Robert Loggia is a good Steve Corella. The other actors are pretty bad or the director was out of his element. Ed McBain tells a good story."
2,Disappointing,I purchased this product to make homemade blusher and lip tint.The color did not get dark enough. It stayed light and it clumped in the finished product.
1,Terrible taste,"Tasted terrible. Had a plastic taste to it. I'm assuming it got that flavor because of the baggie it came in. Bought it to color frosting for my son's cake. It made it a funny color and the frosting had to be thrown out because of the taste. I used a recipe from a good natural foods cookbook to make the frosting, and it tasted good before I added the beet powder. I added it per instructions.Add to this that it arrived a day after it should have... Two-day shipping was actually three day.Really disappointed."
4,"Could only have been better if it was ALL 12"" versions....",There are plenty of full length mixes on here of 90s club classics. Only wish it had been TWO discs with all full lengths!

5,Cute!,This caterpillar is a nice wind up toy. It moves for a long time and has good movement. My son unsnaps the hinge occasionally but it easily pops back into place.
3,smaller than appears,This small windup toy appeared bigger than it really was. Very tiny and would be hard for little fingers to wind-up. It did work and was fun to watch scooting across the table but disappointing in size.
5,"Restaurant ""must"" for small children as well as adults.","This colorful caterpillar makes waiting to be served at a restaurant most delightful and entertaining as he crawls across the table, between dishes and diners. Our grandchildren shriek with joy when I pull him out of my purse. They think he must be kin to the Very Hungry Caterpillar book they love to read."
3,caterpillar wind-up cute,"My daughter got this wind-up caterpillar from Santa. She's really into butterflies, so this was a natural fit. It's cute and small, and she likes playing with it"
2,Did not live up the the Sunbeam brand name that I depended on when ordering on line.,"The pad cover comes off every time I use it. You only secured it with one snap, you should have used at least three or a plastic zipper. The switch is also an issue, it seems you have to turn it on twice to get it to turn on. The reason I have no clue.As a home economist I relied on your brand when ordering on line. I was truly disappointed."
2,Not happy with product performance,"I have had the heating pad set on high for 20 minutes the temperature with my infrared temperature scanner were between 85 and 105. Heat distribution was not uniform. wide range of temperature variations. I removed the thin sponge pad that came with the heating pad before the test. I will be returning the product, definitely would not recommend or buy."
2,Only half the heating pad heats up,something wrong with heating pad only half of the pad heats up this is not a good item would not buy another
2,Disappointed,"I looked long and hard for a heating pad with a moist heat option and was encouraged with the positive reviews for this item. But the real deal is not so cool. The moist option is a thin sponge that's not nearly as large as the heating pad itself. And guess what? The heating pad cover is not waterproof. So you place the skinny sponge in hot water, slip it in the cover, turn on the heat and end up very damp. Not cool at all."
5,Sunbeam King Size Heating pad,"The heating pad was just what I wanted. The extra long size covers the entire spine, just what I expected. It gets very hot so start on warm (where I keep it)and work up to higher heat. It is a great product and if you want the long size then this is what you want."
4,Large and Hot,Love the larger size. The power cord is a good length too. It gets pretty hot on high. Maybe not quite as hot as my old one but close enough.
3,"Questionable, possibly toxic odor","I've been using this item for 5 days, and while it operates perfectly (heats adequately as promised), it emits an odor that's pretty worrisome. The odor is very chemical in character, and it is intense....whether the unit is on or off. This odor also is imparted to any surface or body part the heating pad is placed on. This leads me to believe that the materials used to produce this unit might actually be potentially toxic/unhealthy. I'm clearly not sure, since I have no involvement in the manufacturing of this item. The smell however, is enough to make me stop using this product and find another alternative. Buyer beware."
2,Hot pad + heat proof cover = poor heating pad,"Many say this pad doesn't get hot enough. The PROBLEM isn't the pad: it's the COVER. The cover doesn't permit half of the heat to go thru. Touch the pad itself on the highest setting, and it's hot! But whatever this material covering it is, it's a poor choice. Why--for a heating pad that has THREE OTHER LOW-er setting for the ""heat sensitive""--WHY would you further reduce the heat with this material?The size of this pad is terrific, though. The control is indeed made for people with some busted motor skills, it's really big and bulky. If you don't have arthritis, it's probably excessive."
5,Great auto-off Heating Pad,"I love this King-Size, Auto-Off, Heating Pad. I've owned one for two years and I have digenerative disc disease so mine is used everyday. Recently, I placed an Amazon order for 3 of these heating pads as gifts for family members who have lower back pain. They love the extra length and the auto-off feature. I highly recommend this product."
3,Needs changes.,"Altho this throws out heat well and is an acceptable size it has two problems. First, the cloth cover has one small snap and it frequently snaps open and the cover then easily slips off. Second, from time to time, the heat turns off on its own. Is this because it is overheating? This is frustrating as once it turns off on its own it can not be turned back on for some time."
2,this model is inferior to another model I own,"After buying a Sunbeam heating pad for myself at a local store, I decided to buy one for my sister. I recently visited her and borrowed it and was unpleasantly surprised that this model (#764) is not as useful as the one I had bought at a local store.This model has it's heating element encased in a very heavy plastic cover, then a detachable fabric cover that can be washed. The idea sounds good, but flexing the pad you hear a plastic noise and there is only ONE snap that holds the fabric cover on. The heating pad frequently came out of the fabric cover while i was sleeping.The one I bought for myself, which I am happy with, is this model - which doesn't have noisy, heavy plastic and can be moistened to improve heat conduction through the skin:SunBeam heatsense auto-off heating pad with size: 14 X 18 inch, #807 - 810 - 1 ea"
1,complete dud,I had this for less than 2 weeks when it stopped working completely and I just threw it away. Never again.
1,defective,This item did not work. The heating pad does not heat up. Defective! This item is NOT recommended for purchase. Does not work at all.
3,Sunbeam King size Heating Pad,"Mine arrived in an ugly brown, not the nice blue. So that is pretty bad, which reminds me of Barbara Bush's tasteless but perfectlyin character comment on the night of 9/11, the day people were jumping out of windows of the World Trade Center, that she had had to sleep on brown sheets. So there's that.Also, it is so long and big, the plastic gets all wrinkled.But, it is a heating pad. The best feature is the automatic turn-off."
3,Typical heating pad,"The heating pad does have a strange plastic-sort-of-smell through the first few uses, but it has faded with a week of use and being left out of the package. The auto-shut off works as described (right around 2 hours time). The heat remains consistent and is on par with other heating pads I have used. My only complaint with this heating pad is (like most plastic heating pads): If you are using it for your back and sitting in a chair with it behind you, if you do not take the time to smooth and flatten it back out before it cools, it becomes a twisted, knotted up hard mess that must be re-heated and then straightened out before the next use."
5,Sunbeam auto shut off heating pad,"I purchased this as a replacement for an older heating pad and I am very happy with the quality and the functionality. It heats up quickly, but unlike the previous heating pad that I owned, it does not get so hot on the high setting that it will make you uncomfortable or burn you."
4,Great heating pad!,"I really like this heating pad! It's big enough to cover my entire back. It gets really hot on the highest setting, all the way down to warm on the lowest. It has a nice safety feature of turning off automatically after 2 hours. For people who don't like that, when it turns off you can simply slide the control off and back on. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I don't like how it bunches up inside the case. I have to spread it smooth every day. It's not a big deal, takes 30 seconds. This is a great heating pad for the money."
3,Maureen O'Hara movies,"This is a good movie for those out there putting a Maureen O'Hara movie collection together. The story moves along well and you might even recognize some other upcoming stars in supporting actor roles. The bottom line ? Maureen O'Hara looks great and has that ""spark"" that set her well ahead of the pack."
5,Great Movie,"Loved the movie,Good color, audio is also great, nice plot, and the good guy wins the girl, not without a fight or two.Battle tactics were interesting and detailed, was a unit using shock tactics against the Indians, who were led by a former Rebel who joined the U.S. Cavalry , then turned traitor."
3,dorie,This movie was a bit slow but the scenery was good. I have always liked the American west scenery. Maureen Ohara gets involved in defending the fort against some rebel indians.
4,Maureen O'Hara,I like Maureen O'Harain any movie but love her in a john wayne movie even more ok movie
3,Calgary Flames,"Not to be a snob but this routine TV movie based on Nora Roberts book, whoever she is I might ask, is just average. Not bad just...average. Average direction. Average storytelling. Average acting. Just bog average. The only time my interest was piqued is when I found out Alicia Witt's character went to Saint Leo's Elementary School which is name of the parochial school I went to in Philly. Best thing I can say about this flick is that it's the best thing that Talia Shire has done in years."
3,Nora Roberts,"I really like Nora Roberts books. I really like the movies. My favorite is Montana Sky, but they are all good. I have always read the books first, so I love to see if the charaters that I see in my head when I'm reading the books match up to the movie. I think with all of the Nora Roberts books made into movies they do. This one isn't my first choice, but if your a Nora Roberts fan then you will enjoy it."
1,Blue Smoke is B.S.,"I hope the book was better, because this movie had an unbelievably terrible script, terrible acting (even from Scott Bakula) - I've rarely heard lines delivered so badly from an ensemble, but not only are the lines ridiculously bad, they're spoken badly, too, by almost every character) - and not much of a mystery. Makes me believe the book was written by a 12-year-old, unless the teleplay was just butchered. The pacing was too slow, the characters were ridiculous (the main character cannot seem to focus on getting out of a ""fire maze"" alive ... what an idiot; her love interest, Goodnight, follows a ridiculously puerile fairy tale arc; and so on). Ghastly."
1,Blue Smoke gag gag,"Wow, what a ridiculously bad movie. The acting was awful and the whole premise was idiotic. She goes through a fire maze and Bakula tells her that they are ""going in"". She says no, it is my call, to which his reply is, ""okay"" but made in a stupidly childish voice. That is how this movie begins and it didn't get any better.Her first boyfriend dies in a fire but don't worry, he was asleep and didn't feel a thing. Yeah right, not even being on fire woke him up? Give me a break. The acting was so so bad. I was hoping the movie would get better but it never did. I ended up fast forwarding through the totally predictable plot trying to get to something interesting. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. Move on, nothing to see here."
3,Obsession,"As the DVD back cover says, 'This movie has passion, family food and fire.' And they were correct. Alicia Witt stars as Reena who at the age of eleven watches with fascination as her parents business burns to the ground. When the fire is put out she meets Scott Bakula's character, Officer John Minger, that is an arson investigator. So it is no surprise as we flash forward and we see that she has become an arson investigator herself.There is the requisite romance required for these made for T.V. movies. But in this movie our heroine seems to have attracted the attention of a psychotic arsonist who seems determined to set on fire everything she loves. Will she be able to find this pyromaniac before her new love goes up in flames? The movie also touches on the importance of a arson investigators job."
2,'New Millenium' - most cliched phrase in the galaxy?,"The introductory sections of this book are a really basic overview of learning and attempt to provide an historical perspective on training in the 'new millenium' Have things really changed overnight since midnight 31 Dec 1999? For my money this glib overview is far too generalised - if you've picked up this book, then you've probably already got quite some developed ideas of your own on using ICT for training. Then when it comes to the nitty-gritty like 'How might I go about using some of these ideas? , the book turns out to be very US-corporation centered in its choice of examples with lots of buzz-words, lashings of really neat little acronyms, but nothing that you'd want to bookmark and come back to as inspiration to develop your own ideas further. Like lots of titles featuring the word 'millenium', this one's another also-ran vying for a space on an already overcrowded bandwagon."
3,Access 200 - for dummies,"Book was well organized, and delivered promptly.However, was disappointed in that the book did not address many areas of interest for me, such as setting up security, protecting against errant/accidental data entry into exisitng records.Book would be useful to user with very little experience."
5,Solved My Chronic Lower Back Problem Years Ago,"From my early 20's through early 30's, I was experiencing chronic lower back pain at least once per year. Many times, the pain frequently travelled down my right leg (sciatic nerve). I couldn't stand up straight and would ""treat"" it with hot and/or cold packs and rest. The pain would would eventually go away in a few days or a week and I would be OK until I tweaked it again. I finally reached the point where my 'treatment"" didn't work and the pain stayed with me for three plus weeks reaching a point where I could barely stand. My doctor referred me to a physical therapist who treated my back and gave me this book. That was around 1990 - 1991. Since then, I have used the procedures and exercises contained in this book whenever I experience a ""tweak"" or any lower back pain. I am very happy to say that the procedures and exercises in this book have worked extremely well for me. I have not experienced serious back pain since then getting this book."
1,Not for people who have serious spinal problems,"I bought both ""Treat Your Own Back"" and ""Treat Your Own Neck"" based on other customers' reviews. It isvery good for people who have NEVER had serious spinal problems-- only MINOR backaches and nothing more;no accidents, no real injuries, no surgeries, etc. It explains the most basic, rudimentary mechanics of the spine,posture, etc. and, does include disclaimers which I wish to repeat--- I strongly advise that you see a neurologistor neurosurgeon, as we all have, before you ever consider buying these books if you need help with acuteor chronic problems in any way. I was extremely disappointed in these books. I am looking for the brothers,Drs. Saul, who are the best in exercise to prevent spinal surgery. Thank you."
1,this book gave me neck pain,"The second day after trying the exercises suggested in this book, I experienced pain in my neck that lasted a week and a half. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
4,Sonya Armfield's library,"I bought this book for several people. They found it helpful. But, they also used it along with a licensed medical doctor.Sonya Armfield"
5,Best therapy for low back pain I have found in 30 years.,"I first borrowed this book in 1985 under recommendation from a friend who had gotten his copy in Austrailia. The secret to Robin McKenzie's back regimen is the emphasis on ""first aid"" self treatment and the use of both flexion and extension of the back in remedial treatment. The exercises are easy to follow and can be started at onset of the event, ""My back just went out."" If you have ever suffered the debilitating experience of low back pain, you should try McKenzie's treatment. Printed in New Zeland, this book is hard to find."
5,Deserves full reading and step by step implementation,One of the most effective and well illustrated booklets on low back pain and how to treat oneself effectively. A must-read for chronic back pain sufferers.
5,This book changed my life...really.,"I had severe back pain for most of my teenage years, but when I got to college my lower back hurt so much that it made it almost impossible for me to sit through lectures. The pain was so bad that I could hardly move from bed on many days.When I went to the campus clinic, I was very surprised when I was given a copy of this book as my ""medicine."" However, I haven't had any severe back pain since then, because I have been following the practices in this book. I have been almost entirely pain free for about five years now, and I intend to order several more copies of this book for my family members. A highly recommend book!"
2,A Bit Disappointed,"I plan on going to Istanbul for the first time later this year and wanted to learn more about the city - thus, the purchase of this DVD. Unfortunately, I found it somewhat superficial and not really satisfying in terms of giving me a broad picture of the city. Can't really say I recommend it."
4,Gotta' Have It,"The time this saves you in phone calls and walking around for information is worth the cover price alone. If you love discounts, shows, shopping this is your best resource for the truth about what is worth doing. We got fantastic hotel accomodations and felt like we were in the right place at the right time throughout our stay. I will buy the most recent edition each time I return to Vegas. Yep, we'll absolutely be back!"
2,Dissapointed,"Having been to Vegas a few times for conventions I have a good idea of what's there and where, but for the most part haven't really had the chance to experience it. So, knowing that I'm going for a vacation with someone (for the first time) I wanted to get a guide book to help us plan our time there. This book was really no help at all, even less so since I'd already booked our travel & accomodations (which probably half the book is dedicated to). Also the breakdown of South Strip/Mid Strip/North Strip was confusing to me. The entire organization of the book (to me) made it difficult to glean much useful information from, and for the most part they didn't really delve into anything, nor even give a broad overview. They picked what they liked and talked about it, leaving out most of Vegas, much less most of the strip."
2,"If all you want is a brief overview, this is fine.... but...","I was disappointed in this book. It doesn't offer a complete view of Vegas as some other books do. I was hoping for up to the minute casino and restaurant information, but this book didn't have all the restaurants, only a select few."
1,eh. Loses flavor after a few chews.,Kind of tough on the jaw. Doubt it has any effect other than strained jaw muscles. Loses flavor after a few chews.
2,Don't Bother,"I was disappointed in this book and it did not meet my expectations after reading the previous reviews and the details about the book. It did not provide any helpful information in my opinion and for those looking for similar material, I would highly suggest the book by Gene Kilgore."
3,ancient pictures,"easy book to use, clear pictures and good details. Sometimes with not enough info about items and the time of creation"
2,Not worth the money,"Pretty disappointed by this book, not much usable content for my purposes. A few of the images are good quality, but few and far between. Quite frankly, most of the images seemed more geared for the fairer gender."
1,Skip This Book!,"I expected this book to be much more in-depth and interesteing. However, Goodridge (a hack for hire - freelance writing for boi rags like The Advocate) does not have the chops for this. He offers zero insight. Instead, he simply gives us slight and twee interviews of Directors. It's a lost opportunity. Skip this one."
1,The author should be ashamed!,"I thought Joyce Christmas foisted a pretty lousy book on her readers with ""Going Out in Style,"" but ""A Better Class of Murder"" has to take the prize for being one of the most contrived, ridiculous and unbelievable plotlines ever conceived--one in which the murder is almost an afterthought to the list of restaurants, clothes, etc. It's pretty clear that Joyce Christmas has either lost her creative edge, or has found what she considers a good way to sell a few more books to unsuspecting readers...but she--and her publisher--ought to be ashamed! Do yourself a favor and skip this ...!"
4,Murder among the upper class,"Two characters created by Joyce Christmas, Lady Margaret Priam and Betty Trenka, meet in this book and join forces to solve a murder. Two young boys find a woman dead on the beach and they retrieve a computer disk near her body. Meanwhile Betty Trenka has been asked by her wheelchair-bound friend, Ted Kelso, to meet with Gerald Toth, a computer businessman, to see if he would be a good person with whom to do business. Toth has offered Kelso a lot of money to test a software program, but Kelso thinks that it is stolen goods. Betty travels to New York, where she meets Lady Margaret and they attempt to discover Gerald Toth's true character and also, who has murdered the woman on the beach. The identity of the murderer is hinted at in the book and there are no big surprises when Betty is finally able to point the finger at the perpetrator. However, it is fun to read about Betty's adventures in New York among the rich and famous."
2,Not a real soccer ball.,"If you're looking for a rubber playground ball that looks a little like a soccer ball, then I guess this would be ok. If you're looking for a real soccer ball, however, this isn't it."
3,Not Filled With Air,I received it in a timely manner and in what seems to be good condition. However I guess I didn't read the details very clearly. This Ball come NOT filled with Air. So I haven't had the opportunity to BUY a ball pump so I haven't used the item yet. SO BE AWARE NOT FILLED WITH AIR.
3,So-so,"I bought this on sale for about $40. I'm really glad I didn't pay full price for it. I am black (with a relaxer.) As much as I love the flat iron, the curling iron did not work as well for me as a Hot Tools ceramic does (which is much cheaper than the full-price chi.) I know that it's a larger size but I was expecting at least some curl. It's more of a bend, if I can make it do that. It's pretty much stayed in the box since I purchased it last year."
1,Broke after 1 year 5 months with *very* little use,"Very disappointing. I ordered this item in July 07 - used it maybe 20 or 30 times tops. Went to use it in Dec. 08, it wouldn't turn on. The Reset button on the plug doesn't stay depressed and so it just won't turn on anymore. Good thing they only warranty it for 1 year - a lot of good that does me. Good iron while it lasted I guess. Too much $ for poor quality."
3,"Yeah, yeah . . .","So it's not CURRENTLY authorized. What the other reviewer forgets is that long ago, the Dan worked for money and sold their souls (and tunes) to willing buyers. This disc represents some of those early efforts, legally bought and sold and now reissued, much to Becker and Fagen's chagrin, as not all of them are up to the Dan snuff. But there's some interesting stuff here, especially for musicians. Most of these cuts are demos and the musicianship and production, while crude, still ring with the inimitable Dan potential. For fans only, of course."
4,She is the Queen,"I thoroughly enjoyed this CD. I love the power in this woman's voice.Right from the start with ""EVIL,"" the CD establishes itself as ""No Nonsense."" I wanted to hold her when she sang ""I Cried Like A Baby."" I wanted to get out of her way with ""I Can Love You Like A Woman (Or I Can Fight You Like A Man)."" ""Queen Bee"" is a trip. Pure Koko. Closing with ""Come To Mama"" just doesn't get any better.Now this is what I would call ""A Great Lady Sings The Blues."""
4,Hip Hop at it's best.,This is truly a get up and dance CD that everyone would love. You can't just sit down listening to this.
5,The C.D. is great!!!!,"The Sugar Hill Gang brings back a whole lot of memories. In my opinion, ""Rapper's Delight"" is one of the best rap songs I've heard!!!"
2,"Not impressed, left off too many killer tracks","could have done a better job selecting other tunes, 6-11 are worthless..... Just my opinion, but, you know what they say about opinions...."
3,Buy It For The Hits,"So-so collection from the group who put out the first rap record--""Rapper's Delight""--that became a major hit in 1979. This dance party/roller-skating anthem is included as well as another party groove, ""Apache"", ""8th Wonder"" and ""Hot, Hot Summer Day"". The rest of the CD is just filler, mediocre stuff that was recorded as the group's popularity waned."
5,dissin the Ol'school????,"Of course the Album is great, it represents the beginning (even though I remember King Tim III preceeding it). Saying that Ol'School is crap because something that came out later is ""better"" or more sophisitcated is like saying the wright brothers' plane was a piece of crap because an F18 fighter would kick it's ass. Anyone who doesn't understand that will have a tough life."
4,Great,"Sugarhill Gang's biggest hits are collected on this single-disc compilation. In addition to ""Rapper's Delight"" -- the first rap single to reach the pop Top Ten -- the group's seven other R&B hits are included on the disc, plus three other singles that never made the charts. All of the songs are presented in their original 12"" versions. Not all of the material is first-rate -- in retrospective, the group's old-school groove tended to be a little simplistic, monotonous, and too polished, while their rhymes were frequently stilted and sometimes just outright silly -- but this music, especially ""Rapper's Delight,"" is important historically. Most casual fans of old-school hip-hop will be content with purchasing ""Rapper's Delight"" on a various artists collection, but for those wanting to dig deeper into the trio's history, The Best of Sugarhill Gang is a defintive retrospective."
4,Huge Historical Significance; the Music is Good,"This is definitely a good CD. It's hits from the Sugarhill Gang, whom many musical historians have designated as the first rappers. Or maybe it's that ""Rapper's Delight"" has been thought of as the first rap song? Rapper's Delight kicks off this album, and it's very catchy, chock full of creative lyrics [unlike today's swear-filled rap records] that make for a funny song. The full version, which is here, is very long. The rest of the disc shows itself very much a product of the times in which the songs were written, the early 80s. That's fine, but it's just that a number of the raps don't really have the flow I usually associate with rap. So the record ultimately didn't impress me enough for 5 stars. Good stuff tho, definitely worth 4."
5,Old Hippie,"What can I say......I mean it's Spirit...any of their stuff is definitely worth giving a listen if you're into a jazz fusion, almost progressive, early to late 70's type stuff....personally I think they were a very underrated band even back then....very easy to listen to, the way the music flows.....takes you here and there and brings you back....if you don't have it or any of their other stuff.....GET IT.....and , hey, if you don't like it.....sell it....LOL"
4,"taste , perception ?","funny how the likes and dislikes on a review can differ . the album is uneven yes . there are a few good tracks to keep it going but it finishes great with , in my mind the , best track they ever laid down - ""aren't you glad"" . i never listened to the first side too much and ""jewish"" edited out of the second side (done on cassette tape back in the day) makes the second side starting with ""it's all the same"" as good as they got ."
3,Expand your Spirit Collection,"If you are already a ""SPIRIT"" fan, this is a nice addition to your collection. New to ""SPIRIT""? I suggest you buy a greatest hits and work backward. A band that had an age range from 15-40 sumptin' and spun off into later bands, is well worth every track."
3,Sways together,Plaintive hippie ballads and acid rockers fused with pop finesse keeps things above status quo.
3,"I heard a majority, but not all, so this may change","This is a good album, but has a rather melancholy tinge to it. It starts off rather ambitious with their biggest hit ever with ""I Got A Line On You"" at number 25, but then it goes some rather interesting, but sometimes sad directions. With track number 3 ""Silky Sam"" It got depressing, and another track ""Aren't You Glad?"" it was just as upsetting. There were some tracks that I haven't heard, but it's a hodgepodge, but it misses the mark somehow."
4,an addendum to the amazon review...,"An exceptional piece of work, I just wish to set the record straight... it is not ""Jay Ferguson's bluesy vocal"" on 'I Got a Line on You' - the vocal is performed by Randy California (RIP).My 5-star rating is reserved for Dr. Sardonicus: one of the finest albums ever made."
4,EXCELLENT SOFT CORE EROTICA,I thought this to be an above avergae soft core film. Jenna Bodnar played her part well and se remains one of my favorites. I was a bit disappointed in Patrick Williams though; I thoght he over acted and was not convincing to me.I thought the ending could have been stronger in that the portrait of the Jenna character did not seem to change much.
5,A Handbook for any TV Fan,"This book is sure to become a favorite For anyone who considers themselves a fan of classis TV. Cleaver, thorough, and fun, it is essentially made up of two different sections. The first includes a variety of different lists such as ""10 Best TV Genres"", ""Top 10 TV Moments"", ""Top 10 TV Actors"" and more. Each list is informational but never without a great since of humor. The second half is a list of, according to the author, the Top 100 Sitcom Episodes ever. Each episode is presented in the book complete with a summery, episode credits, and trivia concerning the episodes and the series themselves. Like the lists, this section is also extremely informational without losing a highly entertaining quality to it. Only a few disappointments can be found in the book. For instance, why is the highest-ranking ""I Love Lucy"" episode only number 26? Is there any chance for a recount? In any case, this is still a great book and highly recommended for any Classic TV fan."
2,CLASSIC TV BUT NOT A CLASSIC BOOK,"This book is a collection of lists. But many of the lists are nonsense lists that are just cute attempts at humor.The highlight of the book was the 100 greatest sitcom episodes. Even if I could figure out their formula the list is at best controversial. As another reviewer indicated some of the episodes that made it made no sense to me. The number one episode in the list was not even, in my opinion, the number one show for the series. It was a good episode but ...TV Land is a great network. ""TV Land To Go"" is not a great book."
2,"Wrong George, by George!","The book contains some misinformation. For example, on page 62 it claims George Chakiris was on Route 66 (the tv series) and won an oscar for the film West Side Story. They are half right. Chakiris was in WSS, but he was not on Route 66 the show. Another George-George Maharis was on the tv Route 66 playing Buzz Murdock. I guess covering all these tv shows was a little hard for the writer of the book."
2,Based in Opinion,"The book seems to be grounded primarily in one person's personal opinion rather than a public opinion poll. You will cringe to see what episodes made it to this list, and you'll be disappointed that some shows never even made it. This book is only a moderately enjoyable bathroom read. Several inexcusable factual errors forced me to put the book to rest in a recycle bin."
3,Hit&Miss,I dig myself some TV Land but this Book picks different episodes&things that I feel are alright&some others that I prefer but there isn't a fair overall balance displayed within this book.
5,The Best Despite Others' Criticism,"This book was one of the BEST I have read in a long time. It takes a fantasy sci-fi book to a new level. It was supenseful, intriguing, and a renewal of faith. A great way to say ""what if God had made a place other than Earth..."" Overall: This deserves six stars."
5,An Great Read,I love this book!When I read it for the first time I couldn't put it down until I had finished it. All three of the Firebird Trilogy books were really great although the first one has been my favorite.
2,There ought to be a warning.,"A pleasant enough love story if you can stomach an alien version of Judeo-Christian mythology. Thank you very much, but I've had more than my fill of father gods and will avoid the sequels."
2,A decent insight into Chinese culture,"Despite having grandparents who were Taoist/Buddhist, I never knew much about these religions. Watching The Tree uses various anecdotes from Mah's life as she discusses everything from language to food to Confucianism (which seems to be given a bit of a hostile treatment). I did have some issues with the hanyu pinyin (a kind of romanised transcription of the Chinese characters), which were a bit wanting - and in one case completely wrong. A decent read for those wanting a little bit of insight into Chinese culture."
1,Utterly Tedious,Apparently for Adeline Yen Mah the purpose of the ancient wisdom traditions is to fortify one's ego.
3,IS THIS A SAILORMOON BOOK...OR A COMMERCIAL BOOK?,"I have absolutely no problem with the basic storyline. It's written fine if they're trying to reflect the badly dubbed DiC series. However, in various points of the book, Mixx advertises...FOR THEMSELVES! At one part, Serena(Who SHOULD be called Usagi) is reading a Mixx magazine called Smile Magazine, and says, ""Oh Kemmy, you are so rockin'! I wish I could be a sushi delivery girl!"" Kemmy is Mixx's character from SushiGirl. Then, when Serena is recommending MANGA(Japanese Comics)to Amy(Ami) she says,""Sailor V is a perfect start.""(Sailor V being Mixx's eqivalent of Sailor Moon.)Serena also states ""I also think that Magic Knight Rayearth 1-3 and the first SushiGirl should do it!"" In case you didn't know, Mixx has the rights to all of these. So in conclusion, another piece spoiled by Mixx's shameless self-promotion."
1,Yuck.,"Like all of the American version of Sailor Moon, this is horrible. I used to love DIC's show, but then I realized they put in cheezy dialouge, removed the plot, and added bad voice actors. This book is a phony mutation of what was once a good show. Buy manga or import something from Japan, its a MUCH better use of money."
3,See? right in the middle!,This sailor mercury book is good for only one type of fan: The newbie dic fan. What i mean by that is that the fan reading this book has just started watching sailor moon and has never watched any other type besides the dic version. The jap version is completly different(believe me). Don't let this recommendation swing your vote because i am nothing like you. I am merly advising those newbie dic fans down the correct road of sailor moon dic enlightenment. Gotta Book It! Lita_E (Slr Atlantis@aol.com)
2,Hmph,"I'm so sick and tired of how these people do Sailor Moon. They don't know jack about it, all they want is the money and it's just plain SAD! I'm not going to blame Lianne because I KNOW Mixxine are the ones making her write these books in such a [bad] not even KINDERGARDEN fashion. All this American additive stuff. Uh-uh. It's just so STUPID! The only reason I gave this book 2 stars was because it's the only one I read twice. They all look cute on bookshelves though... And they rate this ""Young Adult."" PUH-LEEZE. I hate it. It makes me literally want to cry seeing how Sailor Moon is slowly being chewed up to be spat out resulting in nothing. Mixxine needs to get their ACT together and start making some REAL stuff. These Sailor Moon novels could be great if people wouldn't act so DUMB with it's writing. Those harpies. They really get on my nerves. If you want some REAL Sailor Moon stories your best bet is fanfics."
4,"An enjoyable, watchable anime series.","First, let's say if you have a school girl/upskirt/panty fetish, then you will love this series. Each episode has plenty of panty peeks, perhaps a bit over the top, especially during the fight seens. In all seriousness, this series is based on the classic Chinese novel Romance of the Five Kingdoms. At times the plot is difficult to follow and it is often hard to sort out the names of the many characters, but this gets sorted out in time. Also, great opening and closing music scores. All in all, an enjoyable anime series from Geneon."
2,Fan-Service Fighting Anime Near Hentai Extreme,I cant's say this is the worst anime but I have to say it's definitely nota good one the story is basically about five high schools fighting for control of the other schools and their students there is so much pantie shotsand a bunch of topless scenes and even some sex scenes they don't show the act itself but one nude girl one boy making out with her and the background and sound is enough to tell you whats happening yes there are fight scenes in here some pretty good but all in all not worth it to continue to watch the end of the series even if it's only thirteen episodes.I like fighting anime and attractive anime girls but there is only so much stupid fan-service you can take and this series has reached that limit.I did not want to buy an adult anime dvd but with this collection I feel I have really not worth it
1,Confusing and Overpriced,"LATIN ROAD TO ENGLISH GRAMMAR is of poor quality. First the materials appear cheaply made, as if they were handmade on a computer. For the quality of the materials the program is very overpriced. The cards actually have to be cut and sorted, this takes about and hour or so. For the price you would think the cards would be ready to use. The program seems rather dry, and can be a big turn off for kids. The DVD's offer very little help. On the DVD everything is very long and drawn out, the woman constantly talks in circles, constantly making references to her other programs. The English Grammer that is present is inadequate. It is difficult to flip through to find answers to the assignments. Not worth the price, and difficult to use."
3,Mediocre,"This is not the clearest introduction to Nietzsche. It's too brief and too superficial to make Nietzsche's thought intelligible. You'll walk away with a vague understanding of fragments of Nietzsche's thought, but no sense of how the pieces intertwine to form a coherent and compelling system. There are many passages that I found helpful, and I especially appreciated the amount of space (3 chapters) devoted to Nietzsche's approach to history, but I would not recommend this book. The best book I have read on Nietzsche is Grimm's ""Nietzsche's Theory of Knowledge"" (absolutely excellent, very accessible and very deep at the same time), with Kaufmann's ""Nietzsche: Philosopher, Pscyhologist, Anti-Christ"" following."
3,SoSO,The seller was right on the money. His shipping was on time his product was in great shape. The only thing i did not like that the songs on the albums sound like if they were some cheap made copies.
3,Unexpected Fading,This detergent does get clothes clean and I like the fact that it is better for the enviroment. My only complaint is that my clothes did lose some of there color pretty quickly while using this detergent.
3,Does NOT work with HE machines,"This is pretty crucial information, especially since many prospective buyers of this detergent would also own high efficiency washers. It says right on the box (but not on the side that's in the product photo), that this powder is NOT for use with HE machines."
3,allen's daddy,"Louis Ginsberg is the father of the famed Beat poet, Allen Ginsberg. and their poetries couldn't be more different. Louis is a lyric poet who wrote in rhyme and meter. there were some political poems in the collection, but not nearly as much as you find in allen's work. the poems aren't bad, they read like student poems, some successful, many not so much. There is an essay by allen starting the book. what should have been a highlight is a big dissapointment. allen spends little time talking about his father and more time trying to discuss the meter of the poems, and it becomes obvious that allen knows little about meter. there are a couple of good poems in the collection, but over all it isn't worth the effort of finding the book, unless you are a ginsberg scholar."
2,Tastes Terrible,"I am not going to comment on the effectiveness of the B12 itself, that varies from person to person and can be somewhat hard to judge. However, there is no sign of Cherry flavor, and to me, at least, the taste is very bad and lingers for some time."
3,The taste could be better,"I bought this B-12 vitamin for my wife. I'm not able to evaluate the vitamin efectiveness itself. I hope it works. But the taste, she told me, could realy be better."
5,Excellent,"This book truly makes the ancient Romans come alive. The passages Shelton includes were written by ancient Romans themselves, so it is as though they are able to speak to us and tell us of their everyday lives. In this book it becomes clear that they were really not so different from people today, having many of the same problems and concerns. Shelton also uses very helpful cross referencing, as well as a thorough appendix and index, which aid the reader in fully understanding the book, which is not a difficult read at all."
