4,Great workout,"I love this workout and the flexibility to change it up, but as a result there is a slight lag between miles as it loads. It is very minor and I overlook it."
5,Ultimate 5 day walking plan.,Leslie Sansone has an excellent product. I love this day walking plan and would recommend it to anyone interesting in losing those unwanted pounds.
3,Far from her best,"I love Leslie and her walks, but despite the cool customization component, this is a boring set. The miles lack her usual spark, the music is this shrill techno, and the full five miles just seem long. (Walk Slim Fast & Firm, Four Really Big Miles and Walk Away your Waistline with Walkbelt are sweatier and more fun.)I do like the countdown in the final five seconds.She's got some nice new walkers on this one but they are just background. I miss Joann, Linda and of course Mary Kay--they seemed like a tight group who were out there sweatin' and having fun."
3,It's alright,"nothing special, just 5-6 regurgitated mile sessions that you can play in w/e order u want. It's nice for those rainy days when I don't want to get soaked outside in the rain, but I prefer a real walk outdoors to this."
3,I hate the music,The overall workout serves the purpose of getting you moving and even breaking a sweat. The biggest problem for me is that I simply detest the music. Gives me a bad feeling.
5,Fun and exciting!,"This is my first Leslie Sansone DVD. I love walking outdoors, but sometimes the weather just isn't inviting for a nice stroll around the neighborhood. I was skeptical at first that a DVD could be fun. Not only is this DVD fun, but I look forward to it with all the variety it offers. I love adding it to my weekly workouts now. It creates a sense of accomplishment and I love being able to gauge each ""mile"" I walk in my living room."
5,"Great price, Great workout!",I have a small collection of Leslie Sansone workout dvds and this one is a favorite. Recommended by diehards and well worth the price!
4,Perfect low impact for beginners,"I am really enjoying this DVD. I have bought previous DVDs by Sansone and this is by far the best - best produced and best put together. I like the options for up to five miles and menu choices as other reviewers have mentioned. I would say it is very basic for beginners or people who are just getting back into exercising (like me!), I have a knee problem but can do these moves without modification (not including the little extra strengthening moves she throws in at the end, which i do not actually use). I know that interval training and extremely difficult workouts seem to be the rage, but I like that this is something doable and enjoyable, that gets my heart rate up and my body moving! If you are trying to work yourself back into fitness and need somewhere to begin, i would recommend this."
3,"Great variations, worth the price too",I think it is a grate product but I have not yet been able to use this product. It does not seem to conform with my DVD player. I can only play it on the computer for now.
5,"Two great works, two great performances","Jeno Jando is a great performer, who sounds good playing many different composers' music. If you don't have these 2 concertos, you have them on this CD beautifully played and at a bargain price.Highly recommended."
4,works great,bought this for my husband to use with our WPG. It works great. no complaints. he can keep track of her at very far distances without worry of not finding her when she's silently on a point.
5,awesome,"I read this book in three days. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. Mary Saracino did a great job through the voice of a child named Peanut. It was original, and very explosive."
3,Spicy without the preconceived taste,3 1/2This is a perfect way to ease into some Latin rhythms and melodies without nose-diving into overused stereotypes.
3,Fast Delivery,I recieved my order in a timely manner but was disappointed when I opened the box. There was no instruction manual for putting the pedal car together and had to look one up on the computer. Once I had the manual the car was easy to put together. Some of the paint on the car was scratched off in places. Overall I was satisfied with my purchase.
1,Smells too much to even put together,"Haven't tried this yet so will update the review once we actually put it together.Upon opening the box, there's a very strong smell that smelled just like gasoline. I expect some VOCs but this was too strong of a smell and too much like gas for me to reasonable allow my child to play with. Sure it's lead free paint but whatever paint they used, it needs to be off-gassed.It does kooks nice and sturdy - will just have to air out until the smell goes away and try it then."
3,Good Pedaling ride on car,It is a good pedaling car for kid 3-5 old to work out with unlimited energy. There is a little downside to assemble the frame is not quite fit.
4,pedal car,This car had (and still has ) a very powerful odor from the wheels.It is not a terrible smell but certainly should have eased once the car was removed from the box. It makes one wonder about the material that was used to construct the wheels.Assembly took more than an hour (the last steps caused the problem with parts that had to really be forced together). Instructions were very good.
4,Good Series,"I found this series of books very interesting for the real time reports. There are also just a massive amount of photographs. Looking back on the reporting now you can see the misleading stories that could be contributed to the fog of war or government spinning of the truth. I think if you are a real die hard World War 2 buff you will get a lot out of these books, if not go to the library."
3,Not as good as the first Street Legal! Boo!,"I just can't understand why activision made SL Redline. With a Kick-Butt Soundtrack and so on. The downfall is just that the cars do not perform real, like the first one. The tires squeel all the time, and you cannot control the car. You cannot fix and repair any of the tires, like the first. I am totally pissed that this game performs poorly. The first SL Rocks.Now after 2 weeks of playing, I do not recommend game this to anyone. Heck, even with my computer 3 times faster than it should be, the cars you try to race will not download! What a failure! The cars do not dent in like the first. The suspension never wears out. But the tires have to be replaced after almost every other street race or long drive. Plus,I cannot see the speed-o-meter."
2,don't...,It is not the one you are looking for...The orchestra doesn't give you the feeling...the balance beetween the piano and the orchestra is not well done by the recording engineers...the piano performer is acceptable but it is not a beethoven recording...I reccomend the one from Philips...the beethoven complete concertos vo.1 and vol.2 with Stephen Kovacevich - London Symphony - Sir Colin Davis...The Only good thing about this recording is its price...performance nearly worths the price...M. Can EL
5,fire fine lnestola,"this is a great soundtrack to make babies, monster babies so to speak with rabies."
2,Love Jim Lee and.........not a lot more.,"I couldn't imagine how I wouldn't love this trade. Sadly, then I read it. The story was hard to focus on with it jumping around and the crisis not making sense. Lee's art was of course fantastic, he is Jim Lee. Unfortunately, the plot was hit and miss, but mostly miss. Overall, a huge letdown."
1,GREAT ART BAAAAD SCRIPT,"Apart from Jim Lee & Scott Williams predictably gorgeous art this is a mess. The tone is all wrong and the plot is lumpy and unruly, it simply doesn't gel. There's a couple of good punch ups here and there and some nice sub plots but it hardly justifies this prestige format or the hype. Great Lee art rotten Azzarello script."
1,a lackluster epic,"With an incoherent story and phoned in artwork by Jim Lee, this two volume Superman tale is one that I traded in immediately at my local comic book store. It pales vastly when put next to Azzarello's BATMAN BROKEN CITY and Jim Lee's stellar run on Batman's HUSH arc."
2,What saved this from getting a no star rating,I currently own the full run of this storyline and I found that the only highlight of Superman: For Tomorrow was Jim Lee.His rendition of Superman and the Justice League were top notch. I'd like to see him draw the Flash title. Although as the series came to it's conclusion messy inking made his artwork suffer greatly.Brian Azzarello's writing turned me off as I kept scratching my head thinking Huh?!.
2,Underwhelming Superman,"Great cover, nice premise, weak story. That pretty much sums up the book. What could have been a post apocalyptic vision of Superman's world and his struggle in it, ends up being a muddled psycho treatise on nothing. What can you do with the world's most powerful hero who can do everything? Explore his vulnerabilities of course, which is why this story tries to do, to no avail. The lack of continuity and disparate storyline coupled with a muddled Superman and muddled plot (this and part two) flunk this book. Do we care ? That seems to be the one question Azzarello fails to ask. A bunch of scenarios and set ups only reveal the emptiness of Superman at the core in this one. It's hard to reinvent the character, and this is disappointing."
3,One Big CONFUSING Mess!,"Don't know what Azzarello was trying to do with Supes in this story but whatever it was, he failed. And he managed to get almost every hero in the Justice League to be badly portrayed too. Not one of them was in character.And what the heck is ""The Vanishing"" and when did it happen? Have to check up on that too.All in all I gave it a 3 stars coz of Jim Lee's art. That man draws a very cool Superman. With another (better) writer at the helm this could have been as good as Batman: Hush."
4,Very Good,As always Azzarello's work did not disappoint. Some very interesting insight to the character and his relations with tthe rest of humanity.
3,Not Bad At All,"This is a good story, a little dark but deeper than the ussual storys that the superman fan's are used to.Too bad that it has a lot of talk and a little action."
3,a weird feeling,"NB: I only read the first book, i.e. the first part of the storyI am a fan of Lee and Azzarello. But.Lee's art is nice and detailed but is a bit self-celebrative. It is cool to look at the pages, but this is not his best work. And I don't like his rendering of Superman. I guess his work was influenced by Azzarello's writing, that was slow and over philosophic without being catchy at all. The author of 100 bullets tried something new here, went for the big story with big thoughts, and ended up with a very slow story filled with silence and a Superman a bit out of character....er, don't think that I didn't like this book at all. It was actually a good reading and way better than the average superhero book you can find on stands. I was just disappointed it wasn't a ""Five Stars"" comic.Excelsior!-Ant."
3,As an e-book it has its ups & downs.,"I planned an impromptu trip to Tokyo and picked this book up to do some quick research on where to stay and what to do. Overall the content was quite good, outlines of the districts were quite useful. I used the e-book with the Kindle reader for Android tablets, and that had it's ups and downs. On the plus side the ability to bookmark, highlight and note sections was great, searching was awesome, hyper linking inside the book and to external web content is cool. The major downside was the use of maps was nearly impossible. The zoom capability was not sufficient enough on the pictures (maps) to make them usable, and the inability to copy an address or use the content to launch a web search made it frustrating to find a location for an attraction."
5,Perfect in both size and content,"Lonely Planet Tokyo is a gorgeous book. Perfect for a large back pocket or to throw in a backpack. Ever aspect of it gets 5 stars. Especially cool is the fact that the authors include ""Best Japanese Fiction"" and ""Best Japanese Movies"" to get you interested in where you're traveling. Highly recommend."
2,Informative but technically challenged,The information is good but the shortcut links in the books often go to the wrong places. This book doesn't help at all if you're stuck cause you can't find information fast. Good to read at the hotel the night before though.
5,Simply disgusting......,"disgusting how cool this is.... where are the NG 2 statues, though...I want more!This is high quality, and highly detailed... pick one up today..."
4,good,"I think that as far as this is a budget CD, this is superb. The Bacchanale is wonderful. So is the symphony. Yes."
3,"works fine, just don't expect video quality to improve","I bought this product in hopes that the video capture quality for my finepix a345 might improve. No such luck. Takes great (really) stills, but still downloads choppy video with inadequate audio. Ah well. Didn't buy it for video in the first place. The product itself (a/c adapter) works fine--lighter than I expected with a folding prong. Good for travel."
2,Bulky and overpriced,"Not worth it... too thick, defeats the purpose of having a Nano. Plus, I also bought a 5 pack of skins including an arm band and neck string FOR THE SAME PRICE at Amazon. In other words, this particular protector is disappointing."
3,Too annoying!,"It is nearly impossible to get the nano in and out of this thing. It's too rubbery and sticky, and i have to pull so hard I feel like I'm going to break the nano. So, if for instance, you'd like to switch it to your armband for the gym, you'd better reserve 15 minutes do so. I suppose it would be perfectly great if you wanted to keep it in the skin permanently."
1,A Real Whammy!,Ouch! I think the B-52's died about twenty years ago with their last album before Time Capsule. A sikened reminding of what happend to all those popular 60s and 70s rock stars is put into the B-52's new album. I agree with the album itself. These truly unreleased songs probably wern't released because they weren't good enough to be realeased. These songs are horrible and if you like the old B-52's don't bother with this piece of junk unless you're a collector. On a final note I conclude that they really are too old to be doing this and they better be hoping that the future generation will like this retarted idea of a record.
3,"OK, but only in small doses","I bought this album to get all of the B-52's hits. That, the album does well enough -- though there are some songs like ""She Brakes For Rainbows"" (which was played to death on the radio in my area) and some others that could have been included.My main problem with the B-52's as a whole, though, is that I can only take them for about three or four songs at a time before they start to get really annoying. I can only stand Fred's rantings for a limited time. Let's face it, their sound is pretty one-dimensional. And certain songs like ""Mesopotamia"" are really irritating (repeat ""THEY LAID DOWN THE LAWWW!"" a zillion times). The same goes for the tracks lifted off of Good Stuff. There's a fine line between goofiness and insufferability.That said, this is pretty enjoyable in small doses. ""Strobe Light,"" ""Love Shack"" and ""Rock Lobster"" are still great songs, and I'm glad I bought the album, if only to have a good historical record of the band."
3,A B-5'2s Best of MISSING key songs...WHY? You can fit more on the CD!,"While this is a nice recap for novices, how can you call this CD a true ""best of"" when is omits key 52s classics - how can you have a 52s CD without GIVE ME BACK MY MAN? (which was a single BTW), LEGAL TENDER? (which was a single BTW), DANCE THIS MESS AROUND? I could go on - we don't NEED the sub-par ""new"" bonus tracks that are but a faint ghost of the real 52s magic. What we need is a COMPLETE collection for the fans! in the meantime, rush out and BUY 52s' new FUNPLEX which drops 3/25!"
3,"Too many ""not-so-great"" hits.","The majority of the songs on this compilation are here for a good reason: The b-52s have put out some enduring music over the years, both early (planet claire, rock lobster) and recent hits (roam, channel z). Therein, however, lies the problem. The old and new are good on their own, but having them together on the same cd lets you realize just how far this band has slid over the years. Additionally, there are several tracks that just shouldn't be here - was there really anything salvageable off of ""Good Stuff""? As if that weren't bad enough, this cd contains two new tracks, one of my pet peeves in terms of greatest hits compilations. Thankfully, one of these tracks (Debbie) is pretty good, actually sounding more like the ""true"" b-52s than anything they've put out in the past 10 years or so. I hesitantly give it three stars."
2,better off with something else,"I heard the album and decided not to but it for the simple fact that all the songs on this album weren't the ""best"". Like most of the reviews, songs like ""she breaks for rainbows"", ""dance this mess around"", ""girl from.."", ""give me back my man"", and ""revolution earth"" (which was a single), didn't make it on this cd. i would have been happy with just ""good stuff"" but ""T-I-S"" isn't any good at all. So if you want a good B-52's album, get ""Cosmic Thing"". that one is a classic."
4,Best B-52's CD,"Despite the fact that ""Rock Lobster"" is an edited version and ""Cosmic Thing"" is not included, this is the best B-52's anthology currently available. Very good sound quality."
5,"Energy, humor, great production values - what else is there?","Like everyone else I heard many of these songs overplayed on the radio in the 80's. What I'd forgotten was how much humor there was in all their songs. Of the one's I hadn't heard, I've fallen in love with many. This won't be my last 52's cd. I think I need to acquire Mesopotamia and Cosmic Thing (I missed the title track from this collection) to start with! What the 52-s do different from most bands is tell humorous stories, over catchy, energetic, get your feet tapping & crank the volume tunes. I was so surprised to find out that I like every single song on this album - that almost never happens. I don't think it's just a nostalgia kick - this band really rocks.After I got this I had it in the car for nearly 2 weeks before I changed it. The only other CD I can listen to for that long is the 2nd CD in the 4-CD Led Zeppelin compilation. (has the Rain song & STH at the end... aahhh)"
4,Almost flawless....,"Awesome collection, though it should have included ""Legal Tender"" and ""Girl from Ipanema Goes to Greenland."""
4,A Very Good Collection of Whammies,"A distillation of the B-52's oeuvre into one small CD. Whenever I listen to best-of CD's, however, I feel the need to put on my nit-picking hat - and there's a few nits worth picking. Their second album WILD PLANET seems to get undue attention (four tracks?) while the good album BOUNCING OFF THE SATELLITES doesn't get any (""Girl From Ipanema Goes to Greenland"" would've fit in very well here). And I was somewhat dismayed to see that ""Legal Tender"" didn't make the cut, either. The two new tracks are decent but forgettable. For those new to B-52-land, however, this is probably the best place to begin."
5,B-52's - 'Time Capsule: Songs For A Future Generation' (Reprise),"Review number 62. Fantastic eighteen track retrospect compilation of this reunited TOP of the line '80's new wave band. As for this genre of music, it JUST doesn't get much better than this. I saw the B-52's play a free gig at an outdoor mall just last summer and it was honestly one of the funnest concerts I've attended in sometime. As for this CD, you get to fully experience once again the college radio staples and some of the band's lesser known goodies, like ""Planet Claire"", ""52 Girls"", ""Party Out Of Bounds"", the unreleased 'original' edit for ""Summer Of Love"", ""Love Shack"", ""Roam"", the awesome ""Is That You, Mo-Dean?"" plus two new cuts, of which both are good. What, no ""Dance This Mess Around"" ? That's my personal B-52's favorite of all time. Nonetheless, 'Time Capsule' is still highly recommended."
5,THIS IS A COLLECTION OF THEIR BEST,I own all of their albums on CD now and I'm a B52'er from when all of us were younger. I replaced all of my LP'S and could not wait until the next CD came out. RICKY you will suruly be missed. My only problem is I never saw them in concert(what a mistake). Ann
5,Nothin' Cooler Than the B-52's or Their Music,"""Hi, I'm (your name hear) and I have a B-52's addiction."" These words may start being hear around the nation when people hear this CD. I admit, I'm a little young to remember songs like ""Rock Lobster"" and ""Planet Claire,"" but that's the point of a time capsule: so us younger folk know what we missed while we were still in the womb. Every song on this CD is great, including the two new ones, ""Debbie"" and ""Hallucinating Pluto,"" both of which I love. ""Debbie"" for it smart lyrics and great sounds, and ""Hallucinating Pluto"" for its off-beat, B-52's innovated quirkiness. I, therfore, implore everybody, young and old, to buy this CD and enjoy it as much as I have."
3,A good read inspite of shortcomings,"Although this book has been ridiculed by some, and it quotes Pat Garrett's book far too much, it makes an interesting good read none-the-less. It covers a new angle in that the spin is towards the Mexican view and feel of the life and times of Billy, an Outlaw who spoke fluent Spanish, that they loved...."
3,Beware RAID-0 drives,"Be cautious of using large hard drives like this running in ""RAID0"" mode, because RAID0 sacrifices reliability for performance, which may not suit the needs of home users (who generally don't religiously back up their data). ""RAID"" describes standard ways of bundling hard drives. This Lacie drive uses RAID0, or striping. For any given file, half the data goes on one hard drive, and half goes on another. It maximizes storage, doubles throughput speed, but makes the array twice as likely to fail. And when it does fail, the RAID0 striping really complicates data retrieval.Most home users would be better off with RAID1 drives, or RAID5 if their budget allows. RAID1 gives you several times reliability for only double the cost of non-RAID. RAID5 gives you both reliability and performance, for a few times the cost of non-RAID. RAID1 is supported by most new motherboards, and by Lacie's ""Two Big"" and ""Biggest"" external drives."
3,Rare opportunity to hear Djamel Ben Yelles,"This album is a rare opportunity to hear the fascinating and hypnotic violinist, Djamel Ben Yelles (also spelled Benyelles) whose work has been undervalued for years. One of his skills lies in floating a musical liferaft for singers with very small voices, and he does this wonderfully here for Jane Birkin, who only stays afloat in several numbers thanks to him. If you are not a Birkin fan, you may find her contribution unbearably irritating. However the numbers where Ben Yelles's violin soars (as in his own immensely popular ""She Left Home"") are well worth listening to."
2,jane,"The melodies are perfect. The songs in the beginning are wonderful, then, it changes. She seems to be droning on about something. And at the end of the album I lose interest."
2,"Great score, poor vocals","While Jane Birkin is surely legendary in her own right, her vocal abilities are poorly matched to the wonderful, and demanding, underpinning instrumental score. Her voice often seems on the verge of breaking, sometimes off-key, other times, weak and breathy, but never sultry. This album may work well as an instrumental version, or, redone by the likes of Natacha Atlas, Alabina, Fairuz, etc... In retrospect, Dalida, for example, would have seemed perfectly matched for the vocal demands of this album. Bearable numbers include ""Elisa"" and ""Fuir le bonheur""."
4,"Fast paced, gripping, great characters.","For a first time out, R.G. Belsky really gets the suspense-thriller genre. Looking forward to more from this author. Take a chance on Loverboy, you won't be disappointed."
2,Weak Sequel,"I was a great admirer of Hello Down There, Parker's previous novel, and I enjoy a few of his stories as well. This new novel, however, leaves much to be desired. I read the first 250 pages or so before I finally got too bored to continue. Parker clearly knows how to put words and sentences together, but his talent stops there. Plot and character development are almost entirely absent from this book.Parker should write poetry. His love for language is that of a poet's. He lacks what it takes to be an interesting novelist on the scale of John Gardner, John Updike, or Gore Vidal. That is to say, he lacks the ability to infuse his fiction with engaging concepts and an interesting story.If you want to read Parker's work, pick up Hello Down There, though you might be better advised to read Fred Chappell, Jay Parini, or David Slavitt, all of whom are fantastic novelists."
1,It only gets worse,"This is one of the most unfulfilling books I have ever read. It has plot holes big enough to drive a truck through and the author is so impressed with his own writing that he forgot to develop the characters or plot beyond a simple and highly unlikely outline.I kept reading in hopes that the ending would bring everything together and create some sort of emotional resonance but it was an even bigger disappointment that the rest of the book. Don't waste your time on this book unless you enjoy reading about a couple of self-centered, whining kids who never get beyond their own skin."
5,Very helpful guide to Paul's theology,"If you are looking for a book to tell you what scholars are saying about Paul's theology ... keep looking! While Schreiner interacts with other writers, and often gives information about helpful books which treat topics covered in this volume in more depth, he has written a book to help us understand what Paul says himself, and he has done it superbly.When you read the book, it is obvious that Schreiner has painstakingly researched Paul's writings with a view to understanding what he thought and taught. He is careful to not go beyond what Paul says, and occasionally tentatively suggests things that are not explicitly stated or implied by Paul.This is a book to read in its entirety, but also to read and re-read, as are many of Schreiner's other works, such as his terrific commentary on Romans and his book on perseverance and assurance, co-written by Ardel Caneday, The Race Set Before Us.Highly recommended."
5,in print,"As the author of this book I shall not review it -- but I would point out that it is in print. Originally published in hard cover by the University of Georgia Press, it is now (December 2000) available in paper back from Black Belt Press in Montgomery, Alabama"
3,good,This video had a lot of information. I felt it was like three movies in one. It was more for Christians and it might be to weighty for universals.
5,Really Works,This is a repeat purchase. It was recommended by my vet for my old dog who has a lot of arthritic issues. It helps to relieve joint paint so he can get around much better.
2,Herbal Remedy,"I have been giving this stuff to my 3 year old Collie for about a month now. I have not seen any improvement in him and give him this stuff with the S. O. D & Boswellia. I was hoping it was going to be a miracle cure for him, but so far, I really don't see any difference in his stiffness. I have a big bottle of it so I will continue to give it to him until the pills are gone in hopes of it helping him the longer he is on it."
1,You get what you pay for...,"This inexpensive cable works as a charger, but on my computer it did NOT work as a transfer cable. Since I bought it specifically as a transfer cable, and the product description says it IS a data cable, I was extremely disappointed."
2,Does NOT work as a charge cable,"Haven't tried it as a data cable, but it doesn't do half of the job it's advertised to do. My main reason for purchasing one was in hopes that it would be able to charge via a cigarette lighter-to-USB adapter I have in my car. No such luck. Doesn't even charge when plugged into a PC."
4,Someone wrote a book about my life!,"How refreshing to finally find a book that tells it EXACTLY how hard it is being a young, independent, single woman in today's world. The protagonist is blunt, brash, and sassy...Kinda reminds me of me! A definite must-read!"
5,Wonderful uplifting read,"I picked this one up on a run to Fiji, regain my sanity jaunt, expecting the usual saccarine heroine and life saving romance. Instead this book was so honest and uplifting and laugh out loud funny , an absolute joy!"
2,"Funny, but shallow","I love a good chick lit book--I'm on a first name basis with Bridget, Jemima and Becky, but the nameless chick of Easy is someone I wouldn't want to be around. The book is funny, but the character spends the entire book talking about sex and pot. Her constant approach to finding a man based on the size of his package is funny at first, but sad and pathetic in the end. I felt like there wasn't really a whole lot of plot to pull me into this self-absorbed, sexually promiscuous and chemically altered world."
3,Difficult to Follow,"This book is about the difficulties and ups and downs of finding the perfect man. Man after man and relationship after relationship, this book is sometimes hard to follow. The narrator goes from story to story both in the past and present and it's hard to figure a place on timeline of her life you're reading about. She bounces between stories of the men in her life and refers to different events. It's an entertaining book but nothing to really get into, there's no real plot other than stories of relationships gone wrong. The end of the book wraps up with a happy ending in all of a paragraph and a half."
1,Pure and utter dreck,"Don't waste your hard-earned money. The nameless heroine is so unsympathetic that I found myself rooting for her hapless victims in their pathetic bids to escape. The storyline struck me as preposterous and I feel I got suckered into buying this book by the jacket comparisons to Bridget and Jemima (both of which I loved). If you simply must read it, check it out at the library."
4,Brazil's answer to Diana Krall,"This is the 1st cd of hers I've heard.It reminds me alot of Krall's early(jazzier) work.Most of the songs are instrumentals,only about a third of them are sung,but the piano(she's the pianist-like Krall) is great,very inventive."
3,Not her best work,"I love her. But this,while not a waste of time, was a bit too avant-garde for my taste.It gets 3 stars only because I must acknowledge her musicality."
3,356 photographs 18 color plates,"Even though there are a few pictures of how-to, this book is mostly a display of designs and finished product. Two reasons to buy this book are to enjoy the pictures as one would do with any art and to get inspiration to complete one's own projects. If Macramé is not dated in its self as a skill this book surly is. However it is still fun to see what you may have missed.Besides wall hangings there is a poncho, overskirt, and body jewelry all made from Macramé."
4,"Very, very good--but not great","In FINAL VERDICT, author Sheldon Siegel has crafted a solid courtroom mystery that narrowly misses being thrilling.Siegel is an excellent writer, and his knowledge of the law--and, most specificly, of trial law--shines on every page. He constructs scenes and dialogue that have razor sharp edges to them.Still, he seems determined to broadcast the resolution of this whodunit early and often in the novel. Even though he patiently and laboriously leads the reader to the final discovery, he makes it too clear how this mystery will be solved.In mysteries, authors who give no clues can frustrate their readers. Siegel gives too many clues, ruining what should have been an unexpected and clever ending.Nonetheless, FINAL VERDICT is very, very good reading, certainly more than good enough to warrant reading the other novels by this same author."
5,Siegel Shines,"Siegel again shows us why he is one of the masters of the genre. His characters are colorful, his wit and humor are tops, and his accuracy is pinpoint. Its hard to pick a favorite, but he seems to get better with each offering! A MUST read!!!"
1,Awful,"Completely predictable. Leon Walker is a weak protagonist. Paper thin plot, unbelievable characters. Awful."
2,Rainy day book,"I am disappointed. Usually, Siegel's books are interesting and fast paced. This is not his best work, but on a rainy day when you've read everything else, it fills the gap."
4,Good Product.,"I modified this product by cutting it to fit a custom new pickup tube on an old RV, I just cut it near the metal fitting and used a S/S clamp to attach it to the tube so this strainer cold be used in the same manor on most systems. NOTE it is a plastic strainerNot metal but is well made."
3,A REFRESHING SCENT,"This scent isn't very flowery and is somewhat of a light, refreshing smell. It's great for women who are outdoorsy and don't like to smell really frou-frou-ish. But, it's not me. And, I won't be buying anymore of this scent. I tried this because my regular scent was out-of-stock at the time. But, this really didn't impress me and in all the weeks I've worn it, I heard only once, ""You smell good."""
4,NOT as big as they claim,"I got this today as a gift for my daughter, when I saw the box I knew there was no way it's 35"", I measured the pillow, it is 29""!I contacted the seller, they say the manufacturer says it's 35"", they don't even make a candy pillow that size, 29"" is the max. They won't change the listing but they should, it is incorrect. There is no way to measure this pillow that large.Other than the fact that it's not as big as the claim... The pillow is nice, my daughter loves it, even she questioned the size after seeing it on Amazon and she's only 8!"
3,"A double CD set with some gems, but uneven in quality","There is some lovely stuff here by Sheila Chandra (Monsoon Wedding) such as Rags from her ""Nada Brahma"" album, and the very wonderful ""Roots and Wings"" from the same album. But the rest of the CD is not always up to this quality, including the opening cut ""Shanti, Shanti, Shanti"" (Chandra) which is rather dull.Still, I enjoyed a lot of the album, filled with songs by Axiom of Choice, Susheela Raman, Greg Ellis and Vas. I think this could have been a single CD album and been a bit better, but if you love Chandra and Axiom of Choice, you will probably enjoy this--and if you don't have ""Roots and Wings"" already, this is a nice way to have it along with Rags. The reason it's a double CD is to showcase more artists in the sampler, but I find it didn't quite work for me; I have to pick and choose what I want to hear on this album."
3,Most hilarious!,"Very few things on TV are funnier than watching these Brits soil themselves every time something goes ""bump."" What are they thinking? Let's go to a famous haunted house and freak out because it's spooky? Sure, now and then something happens that is hard to explain, but the proceedings are fraught with retarded methodology and, more recently, fraud, and so trying to draw any conclusions is hopeless. I never miss this show and would love to have every season on DVD. I'd give it 5 stars, but I had to knock some off for unintended silliness. This one's a real knee-slapper."
3,Excellent Winch for occasional use,"This Rule gas powered winch is an excellent tool for occasional use. Do not believe for one minute however that it replaces a heavy duty industrial use winch for logging or regular use. It contains a plastic gear head that heats up quickly and the bearings bind and stop. Then the entire gear head has to be disassembled and the bearing unit replaced in order to get it working again. But for occasional use where there is no power or hard to get a vehicle into, nothing is like it at any price."
1,RULE CHAINSAW WINCH,"I OWN A RULE CHAINSAW WINCH AND THEY ARE ALMOST USELESS. NO PULLING POWER EVEN WITH SNATCH BLOCKS. EVEN SEND IT BACK TO FACTORY AND THEY SAID ALL WAS FINE. JUST A TERRIBLE UNIT, USED A HOMELITE ONE YEARS AGO AND IT WAS EXCELLENT. IN MY OPNION THE RULE IS STRAIGHT JUNK."
3,Good book,Very detailed and academic work. Had the opportunity to meet the author at a retreat centered in this kind of spirituality. Excellent!
2,fragments of soul,"Rather sad book which draws on his erudition and his personal experience. The background is interesting, but when he describes his experience with his mother`s decline and death, for me he descends into unconvincing sentimentality. I guess he should stick to the academic writing he is undoubtedly skilled in, as those are the best parts of the book. Little genuine experience of the relationship of the physical to the spiritual desert comes through for me with any conviction. I`m glad he survived;but it doesn`t share enough of his experience to enlighten me."
2,Depressed midwestern view of deserts,"Mr. Lane and I share a love of the desert but that's where it ends. He has a romantic and sentimental view, from St. Lewis, of deserts as a good place to go when you're sad. He trys to be sad in St. Louis but it's just not the same. (If I was in St. Louis I'd be sad, maybe I should write a book about that.) If you're looking for a reason to go to the desert and be sad, then this is the book for you! Save your money and stay sad where you are; Please."
3,"Disappointing, in comparison with Gordimer's body of work","Having read the entire catalog of Gordimer's work, I find None to Accompany Me somewhat disappointing. While it had moments in which the reader could feel at one with the story's characters, I did not feel engaged by the story nor the insights Gordimer offers. Part of what makes Gordimer so appealing is her ability to put into words what most people just think and cannot articulate. As well, Gordimer puts fresh perspectives on various issues that make her work constantly thought-provoking. I felt a bit deflated upon discovering that None to Accompany Me was not going to offer the same sort of stimuli."
2,Lost me,"I could not get into this book at all. The method of writing was very hard to follow. I couldn't tell who was talking most of the time. If there were more than two people in a conversation, forget it. I often had to go back to the begin of the conversation and try to figure it out. There also seemed to be more detail about the ""politics"" of South Africa than I cared to know or be able to understand. Granted there may be some that would enjoy this, but it lost me. The only thing that kept me from rating this with 1 star is that I did like the ultimate message of the book. I just would have preferred that the message be given it a bit more understandable fashion."
2,Xbox Adapter Works Only In France!,"The main purpose for these headphones was so that I could use them with my Xbox. After receiving the headphones, opening the box and looking at all the connection cables, I discovered the the cable for the Xbox is something called a SCART cable. SCART is some kind of connection that TVs in France use! Well, living in Ohio, I don't have a French TV! These things are all but totally useless to me and I can't believe I paid over $100 for them. I guess they'll be going back to Amazon."
1,The absolute worst...,"There are tons of questionable ""Drifters"" releases out there, most of them containing inferior remakes of the Drifters' vintage hits by various former members of the group. This is by far the worst that I've ever run across, and that's saying a lot. Although longtime Drifter Johnny Moore is pictured on the cover, he definitely doesn't appear on the CD, which is poorly sung, amateurishly played, and sounds like the work of an anonymous third-rate lounge act. The only actual Drifters song on the disc is ""On Broadway,"" which is just as well, considering the damage that these hacks would undoubtedly inflict on those classics."
1,Not Good,These recordings are not the originals. I had to re-order and purchased The Very Best of the Drifters at $10.99 --- This one is excellent -- has all the original recordings with no fillers.
3,Uneven but interesting ideas,"A collection of essays, primarily about the British scene. The writing is very uneven, which gets in the way of some interesting ideas. In particular I appreciate the inclusion of essays on gender and race, as these issues are usually glossed over in books on punk. I also liked to essay on regional British punk in contrast to London, and the influences of surf & garage music and comix on American punk. These would be best as starting points for discussion, as each is fairly short, and has shortcomings."
2,The Title Says It All,"This book unfortunately amounts to what happens when career academics apply themselves to the task of analyzing what was fundamentally a street-level movement. It's Dullsville, man, unless you happen to be an aspiring career academic in your own right -- and even then."
5,great buy,"i originally purchased these speakers for traveling and loved them - they are the perfect way to transport and listen to your digital music anywhere, anytime without the need for lugging along a cumbersome sound system. unfortunately the first set was stolen, so this time around i looked online and found that they had come down to less than half the original price. these speakers are incredible for their price - they are the size of an LG cell phone but get as loud or louder than a large boom box. the quality of the sound diminishes at very high volumes but is good at the lower to medium levels and certainly good enough for casual listening. i have used them for playing music at many a small gathering. highly recommended!"
3,"One good, One bad","We bought two of these, one for each of us. One of them worked great, no problems, good sound, really portable. The other one didn't work at all. It shows it's charging, but never to the point that it's fully charged and there is no sound."
1,Completely worthlesss - Don't bother,"These are completely worthless. I tried to listen to music through my laptop, but literally could not hear the voices of the singers in any of the songs. Pure distortion. A zero star product."
3,Not a 5 star product,These speakers are very clear but have a very tinny sound. There is no bass even after adjusting the equalizer on the MP3 player. They're fine for listening to podcasts or spoken word but inadequate for music.
4,Great little speakers,"Purchased this to supplement my Dell laptop's very inadequate speakers. Read all the reviews, needed something small, portable that would run off the computers power. This does all that, and I am very satisfied with it. I love that it folds up - like I said, I needed portable; and it works great with my ipod, too. No, it isn't the BEST sound, it's rather tinny, but I expected that. But in a room where the sound can disburse a bit, it's quite amazing, really. And for the price...it's a great buy."
4,Sound good for the size!,Got this for $12.11! Looks good. Mirrored surfaces are pretty but finger print up very easily. Battery is not replaceable :( Quite a bit better sounding than the stereo speakers in my phone... really sound very good. Not as much amplification as I had hoped for... but passable. Very compact!I got these to more easily hear the VZ Navigator on my phone. It will work well for that and also be nice for sitting outside and listening to a tune. I'm very happy with it.
2,Not for long hikes,"The book has a few useful tips, but seems to be geared for camping. For long backcountry hikes, it just offers the usual granola, jerky, etc."
3,Another good Beetle Book,"How much more can you say? Pasi says it again. Nothing new here but some very nice pictures and some old ads. The ""New Beetle"" also gets some coverage and pictures."
2,Liked it at first until I got a dickies beanie,I was new to beanies so i got this one and another one with a visor. I would rather go with a dickies beaine because it feels better and is constructed better. Overall shell out a couple more bucks for a dickies beanie but if you cant or rather not then go with this one.
1,CRAP!!!!!,I still didn't get it!!!!and i suppouse will never get it! i'm never gonna shop from this store again! i'm very disapointed of you!
4,Adds swag,The beanie came b4 the expected arrival date which was good. You cab wear to this beanie in many ways to add that extra push in your swag. Its kind of too hot for one now tho. Idk what I was thinking but overall I like it....... 4 stars
3,"Beanie on, wind gone !","First off, three stars on my grading scale means Very Very good. This beanie is oversized tall beanie. Unlike the other beanies which are useless for my ""a little bigger than usual"" head, this beanie covers my ears and doesnt keep sliding up. It gives a decent amount of protection from wind, and considering am in oklahoma where its windy 24 hours day, you should give it extra points. The material is soft, does not exert too much pressure, and the cost is...lol..well..cheaper than dirt ? An awesome deal, and another amazon purchase gone right."
2,Overrated. Cheap. Thin. Period.,"I bought this after reading the positive reviews here. Am disappointed. For the same amount (just shy of $5), I bought a beanie in store @ JCP. That one is way better, fits over my slightly large head and covers my ears well. This one is small, feels thin and barely covers my ears. This is not going to be enough for a mid-western winter. Be warned: this is only slightly better than the $2 cheap-o ones that you get in a ""dollar-mart""."
1,BLAH,"I bought this because in the Pictures it showed it was long..When I received it, it was just another small beanie. Just wasted $5 on this crap, very disappointed in this product."
2,Not the right size,I ordered one LONG-beanie black and when i got it. It was for a little kid or someone with a very super super small head. Don't buy this unless you are a little kid.
3,Not as pictured,"""Arrived fast, but the hat is not as described at all. It is very very small and not long at all. I thought I've received the wrong item at first but than read other reviews. I gave it 3 stars only because it arrived fast, otherwise it would be 1 star. Don't waste your money. You can get same hat at Walmart for a buck."""
3,strange...,"this is the strangest of the Grant books I read so far, I loved the others but this one is weird. Will have to reread it, for at the end of the book I got completely lost."
3,"When ""electricity"" was the high-tech buzzword","This book dates from a time when ""electricity"" was the high-tech buzzword to explain anything, as the 1950's used ""radioactivity""and we more recently use ""genetics"".The hero has a walking-stick with magic powers via the ""Spirit of Electricity"". It's one of a pair: one will lose its power if you use for any practical purpose, and the other will lose its power if you don't. Unfortunately, our hero doesn't know which one he has.I found this entertaining but light. Buchan has done much better work (e.g. ""The Thirty-Nine Steps"")."
3,Good but not great,"The gloves are buttery soft but there's a 'slit' in the inner wrist that lets cold air in and on a windy day it's brutal. Had I seen a photo of the other side of the gloves, I may have bought a longer length."
1,Useless As designed,Doesn't appear to be waterproof. It's linen type material on the front and a clear mesh material on the back. How would this keep wet or dirty clothes separate? They are completely useless as designed.
2,"Great idea, but not worth the money","I purchased these bags in hopes to organize my cute bag I wanted to use as a diaper bag. On the View, Elizabeth talked about how she just threw them in the wash to clean them up. Well, I did that and my bags are now about half the original size. The zippers are not functioning very well because of the shrinkage. I contacted the seller and have yet to hear a response. This was very disappointng as well since the rating of the seller had been very high. I would not recommend purchasing these unless you never plan on washing them."
1,ziploc sandwich bags are much better,"I bought this set a month before my baby was born. One of the smaller bags tore when I filled it with my babies toiletries. The bags are cute, but they are not durable. Once the bottom tears open you cannot use them again. I was very disappointed that they tore before my baby was even born! Ziploc bags are much better, and they're waterproof! Unlike this set of bags."
2,"Cute, but not made to last.","These bags are cute and serve a good purpose of keeping you organized, but could use some refining. The ""Dirty Bag"" is nice and big, but has mesh backing (along with all the others). Who really wants to put poop stained paints in a mesh bag? The smaller bags for ""goodies"" and ""extras"" are just a little small. Lastly and most importantly, 2 of my bags have already torn at the top seam on the mesh side after very light use."
4,Really liked,The only thing we found wrong was that the bag for soiled clothes has a netting in stood of being plastic so that you still need a plastic bag for wet clothes
5,Excellent for all levels,"This book is truly a marvel for both group working and the solitary practitioner. Do not be fooled by the book's approachability; the pathworkings contained within are potent indeed. One of Dolores' talents lies in her ability to take the occult and make it perfectly presentable to the layperson. This is shown in many reviews where the commenter thinks that a book must be an intro a beginner's book, not realizing just what they have in their hands. I adivse that one not only read the book upon purchase, but work the guided visualizaitions therein, your work will be well rewarded."
2,Nicely written but gives nothing new.,"This is a nice text, some nice images but it was going over old ground so I never actually finished it."
2,"Great Idea, Poor Execution","I bought this for our 3 month old, and the concept is obviously great-- lots of stimulating patterns and contrasting colors. However... once I had it out and assembled, the pieces are so flimsy and there are flimsy 'small' parts. I just did not feel comfortable leaving her alone in her crib for even 30 seconds, while that was over it. Yes, she couldn't reach it yet, but still-- It made me nervous. I think I'll return it and get something soft with less small parts. It's a shame, it is a great idea."
2,missing versatility,"ohai my baby doesn't stare at this because it does not move.If this spun it would probably get more attention, also she hardly lays awake in her crib where it is mounted at all, this could certainly be the issueIf your baby is frequently awake and stares at things that do not mechanically rotate this for you."
1,Missing picture cards!!!,Got this item and the picture cards were not in the package! Only the plastic parts to the mobile. I purchased the same mobile elsewhere and it's a good mobile.
1,Amazingly low quality and cheap looks,"The concept is great!The product sucks!!The following are lacking:1. Thin and cheap look to it. If you are gifting it to new parents, it would be hard for them to comprehend that this is not something you paid more than a dollar or two at the local ""house of crap"".2. For the price, there is no mobility (nothing ""rotates"").3. No music.4. Easily breakable.5. Looks like someone's 10th grade science project than a commercially available toy.6. You can easily make your wife mad - trying to explain why you are not a ""cheapskate""."
3,Well I do like Wimmer-Ferguson but this wouldn't fit our crib....,"It's a very neat, high contrast mobile with a lot of different image options but if you have a modern styled crib with a thicker top slat then this thing will not fit. Only disappointed they didn't make this item versatile enough for different crib designs."
4,"great entertainment, very basic","4 out of 5 starts becuase it is very cheap card connectors. They don't always stay perpendicular to one another, sometimes they are more ""paralell"" due to cheap connectors. I loved this product and have let 3 friends borrow it for their newborns. Perfect at around 5 weeks to put in crib to simply entertain baby for a while."
4,A great mobile,I love thie mobile. My 3 month old daughter really likes it.She always laughs when she looks at the mobile.But the part to connect mobile to crib looks cheap and weak.
3,simple but nice,nice mobile- my son only liked it for a few months so I cannot review it for longevity purposes. Nice pictures- they did hold his attention and the advanced ones made him smile. It is simple- no music or movement- but he never seemed to mind (it held his attention as much as the mobile on his swing which does make noise and rotates). My friend has a newborn who stares at it for long periods of time and I passed it down to her. She says he also loves it. Maybe this is best for 0-3 months range. It was worth the money in my opinion.
5,Baby loves this!,"We have this over the changing table and our two and a half month old loves it! He stares at it intently and smiles at the pictures. It will distract him and at times even make him stop crying when he is fussy. This mobile is nothing fancy, just plastic coated cards, but it is great for visual stimulation for a baby and well worth the $."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in the cheap materials used for this mobile. The visuals are great but the mobile itself is made from very cheap, white plastic. I decided to return it as soon as I took it out of the box! If you can overlook the poor construction and focus on the visual aspect of the mobile then this is an ok product."
1,Maybe good to start out with,"Rating based on daughter's scale: 5-star = ""Yea, Mommy!"", 1-star = ""Rather lick the breathable crib bumper""We got this as a replacement for an existing mobile that is too low. My daughter was very interested while I assembled this, but after I took my hands off of it, she gave me a look I didn't expect to see for another 13 years.After thinking about the brain development books and gender preferences, I dug all of the face-like images out. My daughter was again interested as I assembled everything. This time, she gave all the images a glance before rolling over and checking out the patternless crib bumper instead."
4,Materials fine; read directions.,"1. READ INSTRUCTIONS. If you don't you may break it. If you read the instructions and are gentle(ish) you should have no problems with the mobile's cards.2. Seriously, read the instructions. Very easy to put together.3. My baby loves this thing."
2,Very flimsy & unimpressed,"We bought two of these for our twins, we were unimpressed on how flimsy these were. The cross-bars were very very thin and all the plastic cards were cracked/broken. I ended up making my own: purchased a mobile arm from Amazon (search for mobile holder), printed my own high contrast photos, laminated them, and put them together with fishing wire. My husband cut a dowel to make cross-bars, which I also painted black and white. It was worth the work and I can change out the cards more."
2,I really wanted this to be better,"I chose this mobile for the simple, high-contrast images. On that, it delivered. I took for granted that I would be getting a mobile that spun in a full circle. This does not: the links you use to attach the mobile to the arm only allow for it to twist 270 degrees, severely limiting how much and how long this can spin.The cards are a complete pain to change. To snap them on to the mobile requires the brute hand strength of a veritable strong man. Inserting one card into another to make the t-shaped pair requires great dexterity so you don't tear the plastic or snap one in half.I was really hoping for this to be better quality, in the end."
2,"Good idea, bad implementation",I like the idea of this mobile and would have definitely liked it if it was made a little better. But the whole thing seems kind of cheap and plastic-y. The way two cards are put together causes one of them to split a little in the middle and the cards don't really hang down straight. I ended up returning the mobile because it just didn't fulfill its purpose due to its poor quality. If it was cheaper it'd probably be ok. I don't know why something so innovative that being recommended on so many websites wouldn't be of higher quality!?
4,Good Mobile Overall,"My only complaint is that its hard to change out the pictures. I pulled out the mobile (which I used 2 years ago with my first) and discovered that one of the spindles was broken, the plastic card still seemed to hold on okay."
5,Still a Hit,"Upon the birth of my first grandchild in January, many memories of my own babies bubbled up. One of which was how effective this company's mobile was, so I began a search and fortunately found it online at a reasonable price. As soon as the mobile was easily attached to the crib and my new grandson placed under it, he had an immediate positive reaction to the mobile. Even if he's a bit fussy, as soon as he's placed under the mobile, he immediately calms and focuses on it. I am delighted that I remembered what a great mobile this was. The interchangeable discs make it even better. This will definitely be the baby shower gift I buy from now on."
5,My daughter loves these as flashcards (not hanging as a mobile),"The mobile stand is a light purple color and didn't attach well to our crib, so we decided not to hang it. Instead we use the cards like flashcards and they are super great. I go through them with my daughter while she lays on her changing station, and I secured a few to her crib which she looks at when she wakes from a nap. The best part is how much we use them away from home, because I keep them in a small pouch in my diaper bag. For example, we were on a 5-hour flight and they kept her entertained for a good chunk of time. She is 4 months old now and enjoys holding them herself (one at a time). She will hold one and play with it for a good 10 minutes before dropping it, at which time she's eager for another. Overall very cool patterns and variety and we're glad we got these even though we don't use them as a mobile."
4,loves it,The mobile is simple and she loves it. Four months old and it keeps her attention with the simple graphics. No need to buy an expensive mobile; this one is perfect.
2,"Overpriced, flimsy, limited fastening options","I agree with other reviews that said this product should cost much less, given the quality of the materials. The images and are good and my baby does like looking at them, but we don't even use the hanger arm because it's flimsy and has limited options for what you can affix it to. We bought this to hang on our changing table or bassinet, but that's impossible given the fastener. It is built for a crib with slats and nothing else. But it doesn't say that on the box, nor does the image show what kind of fastener it has. The cards are hard to put together and take apart without breaking, as others have said, and the overall look is cheap and flimsy. Disappointing."
2,Doesn't Fit on Anything,"I was hugely disappointed when this mobile didn't fit on my crib. I'm certain I have one of the most popular cribs in the US, I got it at Costco after all, and the mobile simply will not fit anywhere on the crib. So then I tried it on the bassinet, didn't work there either. So then I thought, maybe somewhere on the dresser above the changing table? Nope. I'm going to have to figure out a way to hang it from the ceiling, probably using fishing line and screw hook. Also, it's made with a very cheap looking white plastic, which will bother people looking for a stylish mobile to compliment their professionally decorated nursery."
2,"Could be good, but not usable for most infants!","I presume most people plan to purchase this for the first couple months of their infant' life like we did...however, this mobile can only be attached to a crib (the attachment point requires a t-shape anchor with fairly wide slats). It can't be used on a pack and play, it can't be used on a standard bassinet. How irritating. What on earth were they thinking? Materials are quite flimsy and one even included an ad on the side of the card visible to the baby...very thoughtless. If this were more functional and could attach to a wider variety of objects, I would give it a higher rating, but how very inflexible of the company to make it only crib appropriate, particularly when it is intended for a child most people wouldn't put in a crib!!"
3,Awkward to assemble!,"Aesthetically this mobile is awesome. It has bright primary colors and my newborn seems interested in it. I'm not sure it was worth the headache it took to put it together though. It comes completely pieced out and is extremely awkward to handle. I had to be very cautious to be extra gentle when putting the cards on. They are very flimsy and seem like they would break easily. Whoever invented this mobile surely didn't have the sleep-deprived parent in mind. I was ready for a nap afterwards. Having said that, I would have been completely satisfied had it come already assembled."
2,not a good buy,"The pieces are cheap and hard to change out the graphics. It is a waste of money. Baby is not interested in it at all, but he is just 1 month now."
3,Just OK,The product is a little flimsy and was disappointed with the size. I guess it is fairly inexpensive so it will work but I would not have purchased this mobile if I would have seen it first.
3,It's cute...,"I like this mobile but had a couple of problems with it. First, the attachment doesn't fit my crib so we ended up hanging it from the ceiling. So, if you can't do that, I would be hesitant to buy it as you may be wasting your money if the crib attachment doesn't fit your crib either. Also, while the actual mobile things are beautiful and bright and great for educational development, they are hard to put together and take apart without twisting off the thing that connects them.Regardless, my daughter loves to look at it, especially when the fan blows it so it moves."
5,Surprising hit!,"When my husband bought this product, I didnt think my son would be interested in it. We had another mobile from Tiny Love which played music, was very colorful and moved in multiple directions and my son was indifferent to it. So I didnt think this one would be of any interest either, since it was mostly black and white, did not move and did not play any music. Boy, was I wrong!My son became interested in this right from the beginning, about 2-3 weeks old. He would just lie in his crib and stare at it, almost as if he was hypnotized by it. Sometimes this would go on for a whole 20 minutes! I had time to eat and do a bunch of other chores as well. We even got him a second one for his changing table, sine he liked it so much.Now at 4 months old, he still likes to look at it, although it does not hold his attention as much as it used to before. But overall I think we got our money's worth many times over with this item."
4,Always catches her eye.,"I bought this mobile to stimulate her with the early black, whites and reds infants see (1-4 months) and to help develope her sight. I put it above where I always change her on the couch and where I will sit her on her boppy. She always looks at it and now that she is almost 4 months is looking at the colors more. If I have in my lap near it she will turn her head to look at it. It has interchangable cards in black and white and color so you can change it up and rearrange so they don't get bored. Keeps her attention for 5-10mins. which is great to get a cup of coffee, go to the bathroom, etc. I would recommend this mobile, although it might be better if it rotated and played music as well but its good for what it is. -Maya's mum"
5,Awesome mobile!,"This mobile is definitely more intellectully stimulating and cheaper in price than those ""themed"" mobiles you see at Babies R Us. There were about 5 responses listed as to what your baby would do when he/she saw the mobile and our daughter did every single one! I hadn't seen her react to anything like that before at 10 weeks old. She was cooing, squealing, smiling, and focusing on the objects. It was so entertaining watching her interact with the mobile! Plus, you can get a good 15-20 mins. to get something done. I let her play in her crib while I'm getting ready in the morning. I wish I had bought it for her when she was born to stimulate her senses sooner, but whenever you buy it, you will still get a lot of use out of it. It is very easy to assemble and attach/take off the crib."
3,"Baby loves it, I don't","You may be thinking that all that matters is what the baby likes, and I'll mostly agree with you, which is why this gets even three stars. Since about eight weeks old, she LOVES it. Smiles and talks to it.Why I don't like it:Cheaply made. Ok, no biggie. But, more importantly, extremely hard to change the pictures. Nearly impossible, in fact. And, strangely, half the cards are vertical so the baby couldn't see them, even if I don't place her directly under.I'd pay double for a well designed version. Meantime, the baby, and the manufacturer, win, but I'm not happy about it."
4,Check your crib first,"My wife convinced me to buy this mobile for our baby. I did and was pleased at first because it comes with a lot of cards for the mobile and seemed simple enough to install. Unfortunatly the wood on our babie's crib is too thick for the hardward to fit through. The hardware needs a wood a crib that has less than a 3"" slat running across the top. My crib has about 5-6"" slats. Because of this I got a wood router bit and drilled my way to success. I also am not impressed at the quality of the plasic, it seems rather cheapish. It should work and for the price I really can't complain, but I would rather pay a little bit more and get a more quality product."
1,Cheaply made,"After only a few minutes into assembling the mobile per the instructions I managed to break one of the over hanging arches that holds the cards. While trying to insert the lower hanging arch into the hole specified in the top arch it broke in half. Also, it was impossible to attach the cards to the little nodules on the arches without tearing them because the nodules were too big for the holes in the cards or visa-versa. Overall the attach points / integration points that hold this mobile together were not correctly sized. Seems like the manufacturer made the pieces but never tested to see if the pieces actually fit together."
2,"good idea, flimsy quality","The mobile was great at catching my daughter's attention. She loves to stare at it. And, from what I hear, this high contrast stimulation is good for her development. I am just diappointed with the quality, as the whole mobile seems flimsy and cheap.The picture cards are interchangable, but as far as I can tell, they can only be placed in one direction. --There is one card that lies horizontally, and one that attaches to the mobile vertically, but you can not attach the horizonal one to the mobile, nor can you lay the vertical one horizontally to be viewed by baby. So I feel that the choices of view are limited. However, the horizontal cards are two sided, so that does increase the options. (I know this may not make sense until you actually see the mobile in person!)All in all, it's good for capturing baby's attention, but I would have been more satisfied if the price was lower considering the quality."
5,favorite newborn toy,"I put this over my son's (9 weeks old now) changing table and he loves it. He will stare, goo, and reach up for it for a long time. He likes this thing more than his Tiny Love play gym. It is well worth the $$"
4,Educationally wonderful! But very rinky-dink.,"We have this hanging above the crib at baby's daycare and even though he's been there about 4 months now, it still mesmerizes him when we drop him off in the mornings. We switch pictures very occasionally, and twirl it a little as we leave and that seems to be enough. The plastic link chain is adjustable and the arch is higher than the other baby mobiles at the daycare (mostly symphony in motions, which we have at home but he gets tired of very quickly) so I love the proximity to baby's face. However, the cards are hooked to each other very poorly and the ones facing baby will not lay flat. He can still see them, but it bugs me. Also, if we aren't careful when we lean down to give him a kiss, we always end up knocking off a card or two, since they are lightly balanced on little plastic hook-things. This is a bit annoying. Still, the cards are light and will not hurt baby when they fall and the benefits of this toy far far outweigh the little annoyances."
3,Great Idea! Poorly Made,Our 2 month old son will stare at this mobile for about an hour. He loves this mobile. The downside is that the picture cards are very hard to change and breaks very easily. I actually broke the frame while trying to put it together and had to tape it back together. So be very careful with this product. I wouldn't have mind paying extra for better quality.
3,low quality product,"This mobile keeps my 1 month old interested, but the quality of the product is undesirable. The top card does not form a nice 90 degree with the bottom once it is inserted. We only wish the cards can be a little easier to change."
2,Disappointing,"My oldest daughter enjoyed this mobile's pictures when she was a baby. However, the plastic is very flimsy and it broke, so I bought a second one for my second daughter. The plastic broke as I was assembling this mobile. I would recommend looking for another similar product rather than wasting your money on something that breaks so easily. Wish I had!"
4,Worthwhile purchase.,"Cute, effective and easy to attach, except for the actual discs. They were really difficult to put on and take off. Hence only 4 out of 5 stars. Otherwise my baby loved this mobile. He always found it very entertaining. I recommend this product for sure."
4,Nice toy!,"I recommend this toy, my son likes it and would stare at it for some time. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I don,t understand how to twist the cards to its place, but other than that the toy is great!"
2,So-So baby not all that interested,With no movement or sound this mobile is just so-so...thought with all the good reviews it would be a little more stimulating for baby! Cute but rather flimsey and doesn't really hold on crib rail that well!
3,Cheap materials but good idea,"I bought this mobile because it is one of the few I've seen where the picture face the baby, who's laying in the crib. I was also excited the ""cards"" are interchangeable. When it arrived, I was disappointed by the very cheap ""arms,"" and nearly broke one during assembly. Also, the cards are not interchangeable. I can flip over the horizontal card, the one that faces the baby, but I cannot interchange the vertical and horizontal cards. As some of the best patterns are on the vertical cards, I am disappointed by this as well.That said, baby does find the patterns fascinating and exciting."
3,Could use some work,"I'm not sure how this toy would be for my son since I can't get it to attach to my crib. When I hold it up above his head myself, he loves it, but since I have a crib where the edges curve out at the top, the design of the mobile doesn't seem to work. If you have a standard crib where the sides are completely vertical, then it should be fine. Otherwise, it doesn't seem to want to attach."
2,Im-mobile,Before buying this product I did not realize that it does not have any mechanism for movement other than swaying in a breeze or by being moved by a parent's hand. I would have expected motion from a mobile. We call it the im-mobile in our home.
3,good idea- which cribs did they test the arm on though?,"I love the idea of baby centered graphics, but the slot for the arm to fit on the crib is not made for cribs with slightly thicker slabs of wood (anything larger than about 3 inches). The edge of our Europa Palisades Crib (the one recommended by consumer reports) is way to wide to fit in the arm (about 4 inches)- so now I am thinking of rigging a wire to hang down from the ceiling- not exactly the ""plug and play"" experience I would like from a product as simple as a mobile. I do wish all the pieces could lay flat for more interchangeability- like a few previous reviews have mentioned only half of them can actually face down. The graphics are cool though!"
2,"Good idea, poor quality, doesn't fit with all cribs","As an optometrist, the idea of this product is great. That's about it. The quality is quite poor. It doesn't fit on the arched side of our crib (nor the straight front/back end) which deems it almost useless. We ended up holding the cards up like flash cards. When no longer needed, it all went in storage. I recently took it out for my newborn #2 and the thin plastic parts that connect the cards to the main base were broken. Poor quality and doesn't fit with all cribs."
2,not impressed,"I had high expectations for this mobile.The discs are really cheaply made and the way youput them together is not ideal, it would be easyto break off the connector. Plus in the picture it looks like thecircles and squares stand up on one another, but mine don't, theyjust tilt sideways and don't stand up. Plus the directions are notgreat and they don't tell you what ages are good for colors vs. blackand white and abstracts vs. pictures."
1,Lackluster,"This product was a BIG disappointment. I would have given it 0 stars if it was an option. I thought it was a great idea -- just poorly executed. Save your money. It's difficult to switch the visuals and never held my child's interest. After a few weeks, I've already taken it down and replaced it. If you can, I'd wait for the Lamaze Freddie The Firefly coming out in August. Since that one is not available yet, I purchased the Tiny Love Classical Mobile. It seems to be holding my child's interest well enough."
2,Very disappointed. This mobile didn't fit on our crib or changing table.,"With all the great reviews, I had high expectations for this product. Upon assembly, my husband pointed out that the slits made to take the cards apart are actually just slightly too small and will cause ripping. Poor design.Secondly, and more importantly, the mobile wouldn't fit on our crib or changing table as it is apparently designed for a crib with a short bar at the top. We have a Babyletto brand crib and changing table, so nothing weird or unusual. So sad. Now we have to return it.Before buying, make sure your crib or changing table has only a thin bar at the top in order to accomodate this mobile! I'm sure if this weren't the case I would have otherwise been quite happy with this product!"
3,visually stimulating,"Our baby does seem to look at these more than other mobiles that came on his swing, bouncer, etc. The quality is only ok- basic plastic disks. They suggest changing out the disks to keep your baby interested, I'm hoping that they do keep his attention so I feel even better about the purchase. Right now I'm just not convinced its appreciated enough by the little one!"
2,CHEAP!!!,"Don't expect a lot from this mobile! I wanted a stimulating mobile, but I ended up with just frustration. The plastic cards that hang are SO hard to take apart. We cracked a few in the process. The end result was a cheap looking mobile that looks like it could have been made by a kindergartener. I do NOT recommend this mobile."
3,wrong pieces in the box,"This mobile has great reviews and while it's not the cutest thing, it is supposed to be the best mobile, developmentally. I'm sure it is but when i opened the package today i found two sets of the same 4 pieces. Unlike the picture which shows a variety of round and square pieces, i got two sets of the square pieces. That really doesn't do me any good in terms of switching the pieces around for variety. I can't speak to how the baby likes it as she is not born yet. I however, am disappointed."
3,Ok Mobile,"I bought this on a recommendation from my aunt. My daughter loves it and finds it fascinating to look at. However, for the price I can get the same one off the website and it comes with more pieces then the one on Amazon. The one from Amazon had less pieces, so she got a bit bored with it when I ran out of pictures. Also it doesn't spin like most mobiles and she loves for it to spin. Had to buy a separate motor."
4,diaper change distraction,We bought this mobile to hang above our daughter's changing table when she was 7 months old and got very squirmy on the changing table. The shapes and color of the mobile will keep her entertain and make diaper changing much faster and easier on us!
4,very pleased,"I am very pleased with this product. I love the fact that the cards are not just black and white, but with colors too which makes the mobile even more stimulating. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with little ones, as a matter of fact I even purchased one for my sister, she loves hers as well!"
4,baby likes it,"My baby always smiles and laughs when she looks at this mobile. Even though I don't think it's particularly cool-looking, she does, and that counts!"
3,"Child likes it, but...","We were initially very excited by the fact that our 2 month old daughter loved this thing instantly. But upon using it a bit more, we have seen 3 major limitations that we suspect will make it short-lived.1. The cards are very hard to replace without breaking (due to the cheap, stiff nature of their plastic and the small knobs that hold them together).2. It doesn't spin.3. The vertical cards are almost useless, since the baby cannot see them when she is directly beneath the mobile (where baby is most intrigued), and since the vertical and horizontal cards have different hole locations and therefore cannot be swapped with one another. All it would have taken is an extra set of holes in each card (no cost!) to achieve this but the manufacturers missed it entirely.Baby likes it...for now. But we know that overstimulating her with the same images, and ones that don't spin, might be a problem with this mobile."
2,Cheaply Made,"Like another reviewer I broke one of the arms while assembling it. Other than that part, the rest of the assmebly was intuitive. The build quality is fairly cheap, but it is probably ""good enough for $20"" except for the arm.So I'll be ordering some super glue to fix the broken part:("
2,snapped,I broke the arm while putting it together!!! I was so excited about this item because it is based on educational principles and I was equally bummed when it snapped in half!
2,Poor quality,I must admit that my daughter enjoyed looking at this mobile for the first couple months of her life. My complaint is that the product is flimsy for the price. The holes punched in the cards were so small that when hooked onto the arms of the mobile they cracked (many arrived already cracked). The arms and cards tend to fall off if accidentally touched even slightly. And the cards are somewhat translucent so you can see the image on the reverse as well.
2,Great idea--POOR quality,"As an ophthalmologist, I can attest to the functional utility of this product. Newborns truly are drawn to high contrast patterns--but this product is so poorly made I would not recommend it. The plastic cards are badly made--3 of them were broken straight out of the box such that I had to use tape to put them back together. In addition, the holes in the card to attach to the main apparatus are inconsistent so that some fit too loosely and are easily knocked off while others are so tight I can't get them attached. If motivated, you could probably make your own sturdier mobile--the patterns are available online."
5,great mobile,"This mobile is very well designed, my son really loves the pictures, they are reversable so I can switch them as he gets older, the pictures face the baby unlike most mobiles."
4,Could be so much better,"I'm giving 4 stars a my 5 week old baby is drawn to the shapes and thus is getting good visual stimulation. You can almost feel those neurons connectng. But for an extra dollar they could give you a wind motor to rotate the mobile and thus develop visual tracking skills as well. Still, much better then the average stuffed animal mobile."
5,a mobile meant for baby's amusemet not just adult's,"It is simply and light, easy to put together. Fun to interact with baby discussing to the different shapes and colors."
2,So So,I was looking forward to this product. The actual pieces are hard to switch out. I could tell that my baby was looking for it to move like her other mobile.
5,Well crafted and well written!,"Retribution is a classic mystery novel that is well written and well told. The details fit, the questions are answered, and the story moves. Lew Fonesca, a ""bumbling competent"" unlicensed private investigator, gets his man and affects everyone's life but his own. He is making progress, however, because it is when we help others that we help ourselves. This is an enjoyable book."
3,Who cares?,"There are certainly redeeming features to this novel (meshing of the past in present in Fonesca, the sense of mystery) but the bottom line is that I just didn't care what happened to the characters. Fonesca is wallowing in old movies (although he seems well read he shows no interest in reading). Ames lives in a bar even though he's capable of much more. I can understand how Adele turned out the way she did but she's still pretty bratty.The highlight of the novel for me was Fonesca's take on Stephen King: ""overpayed and underrated"".It's a shame I didn't enjoy this novel more because Kaminsky is an excellent writer. His whole Rostnikov series is absolutely fabulous - every single one of them. You really empathise with those characters - maybe because they're putting real effort into their lives."
1,Terrible,I only had 100 pages left to go in this book and gave up. It was completely boring. The Abe Leiberman novels are better.
1,Wonderful product--lousy service on Amazon's part,"I actually received two of these from Amazon--both smashed to smithereens. After I received the first one and reported that it had arrived broken due to an extremely poor job of packing on Amazon's part, they sent me another, It was likewise poorly packed and also arrived broken. I haven't had time to repack and return the broken shards to Amazon, so haven't received a refund. I did, however, purchase the same souffle dish from another company who takes care to pack things properly and I love it--wonderful product. Great dish--just buy it somewhere else!"
4,Nitty Gritty Dirt Band: The Circle Trilogy,"You won't hear much on these CD's that sounds like the Dirt Band as we knew them in the 70's. The real worth of this collection lies in the preservation of grass roots country tunes, lyrics and voices over a span of three decades. Remarkable and admirable!The inclusion of live conversation is a nice, personal touch, but unfortunately the volume is a bit lower on those segments and it's sometimes necessary to adjust volume up and down as needed to hear.The collection is referred to as 'deep Americana' and is a mix of country, gospel, bluegrass and folk. Many artists appear, but particular honor seems to be given to Mother Maybelle Carter. Nice touch! A real collectible."
1,Will the circle be unbroken - The Trilogy,I was unable to assess this product because the disks were faulty. I could not play Disk #6 on any CD palyer and the others would not play fully on my car player.
1,The first sci-fi novel I ever read.,It is a miracle that I ever read again.Zero stars. Are there negative stars?The main character's name is Captain Broadsword. Need I say more?
5,"Helpful, Encouraging and Practical","This book was so needed as I continue to search for a simpler, more biblical approach to church life."
3,Buy Murder Ballads: Best of disks suck...,"Nick Cave is undeniably a genius. He has a stunning talent for writing good music and performing. However, each of his albums has its own peculiar character, and should be listened to individually. The ""Best of"" disk really rapes Cave's music. Buy Murder Ballads, which is the best CD I have ever listened to."
2,Into My Arms,I bought this entire album for the song 'Into My Arms. It remains the one song from Nick Cave with which I connect. The rest of his music clangs in my head and makes me tired. Sorry to all you Nick Cave fans.
5,A Great Start For Beginning Cave Fans,"I first became familliar with Nick Cave through an article in Entertainment Weekly. I found him to be a very interesting person and I seriously considered getting into his music, but I didn't buy one of his album until about a week ago.""The Best Of The Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds"" is a 16 track collection of some of the most amazing songs I've ever heard. Cave's lyrics more often than not approach the same level of complexity and brilliance as those of Dylan and Lennon. Songs like ""Red Right Hand"", ""Tupelo"", the achingly beautiful ""Into Your Arms"" and many other songs here are some of the most vivid musical experiences one can ever have. Other standouts include the wild ""From Her To Eternity"", the eerie ""Stranger Than Kindness"" and the heartwrenching ""Nobody's Baby Now"".The liner notes makes for a good read and the sound quality is great. Definitely a must for fans of good music."
3,Lacking essentials...,"Overall, this compilation is pretty weak...but a good way to get ""introduced"" to one of the greatest musicians of all time. Misunderstood as they come, Cave has released so many good albums, most of which I've reviewed on here and all of which I own. I felt it was my duty as a fan to go pick up this cd. It doesn't contain enough of his older stuff. Here is what I would consider to be a better collection of 16 Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds songs:From Her to EternityThe Six Strings That Drew BloodThe Mercy SeatCity of RefugeSad WatersThe Weeping SongLoom of the LandJohn Finn's WifeStraight to YouJangling JackLovermanLay Me LowInto My ArmsStagger LeeBrompton OratoryPeople Ain't No GoodThat's just my opinion. I'd reccommend starting a full Nick Cave collection, beginning with his first cd, rather than buying this ""best of."""
3,Disappointed,"This will be fast. I love Nick Cave. He is the wonder of a dark world. His ""best of"" gives you only the pretty parts of an astonishing, often otherworldly, foray into dark emotion, from sorrow to anger to muder and beyond. These songs are uniformly fantastic, but no match for the truth. Seek Nick out, cynical traveller...."
3,Disappointed,"Great songs, of course, but I'm annoyed that a ""Best of"" compilation of Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds would hack ""Red Right Hand"" all to pieces, and in poorly-edited fashion, no less. As far as ""avoiding best-of pitfalls"" ad mentioned in the Amazon review, this album fails to avoid the most grievous one."
4,"I was introduced, pleasantly","I was curious about giving Nick Cave a hard listen, and didn't know where to begin. I'm wary of 'Best Of' sets, and so picked up 'Henry's Dream,' which was a tad flat and monotonous but not enough to settle the matter one way or another. So I gave this set a try and have really enjoyed it. Cave is a fine and unique song writer, with deep roots in blues and folk music which underlie his work, and the Bad Seeds are an excellent band. For the curious, like me, I think this is an excellent choice and a great introduction to some smart, rich and able music."
5,Review of K-zone magazine,"I think it's a cool magazine and suitable for kids like us.It has all the cool stuff like celebrities,comics,reviews etc. I really like it and will always wait impatiently for it to drop into my mailbox.:)"
3,Still searching for the one I bought in Hong Kong,"This product is just okay. I thought it was the same one I purchased in Hong Kong(Comptoir Sud Pacifique Tiare). That had staying power. This one just fades away within about an hour. I also found the product in Paris, where I will probably have to go to find it again."
4,Enjoyable and thought-provoking treatment of family issues.,"Schwab has written an intelligent book that expands on thedefinition of a modern-day family. Exploring both the legaland emotional issues that confront gay and lesbian parents,this novel is a must-read for those interested inthe question, ""What makes a family?"""
4,Interesting profile of family life,"I really enjoyed this book as my niece has just ""come out to me."" I shared the book with her, and she and her friends are also enjoying it. The book pointed out the legal intricacies of a gay lifestyle in a very sensitive way and the characters were realistically drawn."
3,In a Family Way,"I found In a Family Way very compiling especially since we are seeing custody rights being challenged in the courts. More specifically the custody rights of gay and lesbian parents is even more dramatic and this novel does wonders for individuals who are struggling with these kinds of issues. Even if one is not gay or lesbian, one can learn from the characters in this novel because their experience is so real. --A gay reader in Arlington, VA"
1,Polarized but not Photochromtic,Good style but not as advertised. This is polarized but doesn't change the shade of color according to the definition of photochromatic like a transition lens.
4,happy camper,i had an older hard bound copy of this book and was looking for a smaller paperback copy. this was quite an old book so i was very happy to find this. it certainly met my needs
2,pretty disappointed,"I was kind of surprised that I hadn't heard any of the songs from this album get at least a little air play, but after listening to the CD, I can see why. Just about all the tracks sound muddled. I was pretty disappointed by the mixing. To me, the instrumental portion of the songs drowns out the lyrics. It is really hard, harder than it should be, to understand the words because the singing is overshadowed buy the instruments."
2,a disappointing album,"I am a huge fan of BNL and I have every cd they have ever put out. For the very first time I have been disappointed with one of their cd's. It is a very slow and boring cd, just not true to them. The Barenaked Ladies are Me is very good, this one is not."
4,Sounds Good,I thought I had all the albulms but somehow missed this one. Sounds pretty good so far. Has a few catchy tunes on it.
4,Not as good as their previous albums,"I love the bare naked ladies, am a big fan, but this latest cd is more about head banging rock style songs, I love their ballads, but they jaz them up a bit too much for me. You hear rock songs in country music stations that pass themselves off as country, not! this is the same thing, sounds like they are making themselves harder rock, I don't the like the direction this is heading.Please Bare naked Ladies go back to the vintage role of singing, I loved those songs."
3,Quantity replacing quality,"I have been following BNL for about 7 years and just went on a cruise with the band and fans. This and the previous BLAM cd are full of good BNL songs but missing are the two or three classic BNL songs that we have come to expect over the years such as The Old Apartment, Alcohol, Brian Wilson to be on each cd. With previous cd's, a few songs would immediately catch the listener and call for repeated plays. This album takes repeated listens to find the best songs which seem to be similar to the second tier songs from previous cds. It is true, that many of us have been spoiled, expecting to hear classic songs and some good jangle rock on every BNL cd. I expected after the long gap between the first BLAM release and the previous album we would have had a superior result...not just two good cds.For those who are recently getting to know BNL, these last two cd's are probably not where to get hooked on this great band."
2,mediocre and political,"This cd starts out poorly. By the third song I was regretting the purchase. Then it started to pick up a bit, but ultimately the best songs in this collection aren't really enough to carry it. I like ""Half a Heart"", ""Maybe Not"", ""What a Letdown"" and a few others, but they would be filler on some of BNL's better CDs.As for the ""political"" part of the review's title, fans should note that ""Fun and Games"" is a rant against the government (presumably George W. Bush and Stephen Harper based on the release date, though they aren't mentioned by name)and the military establishment. If you don't like politics injected into your music, this song, along with the overall mediocrity of ""BNL Are Men"", might make you want to consider spending your money on a different BNL CD."
3,Not their best CD,"I am a die-hard BNL fan, so I liked the CD... but I can say this is one of their worst CDs. Not as bad as their newest (I am no longer buying CDs from them, as the bad has dropped my favorite member- and it shows in the music) I did like a few of the songs, but overall- this CD was weak. I am still happy with my purchase though, as I really wanted ""half a heart"" and it isn't a terrible CD, just (by far) not my favorite."
3,Disappointing,"First let me say that I'm a HUGE Invicta fan! I own two other Invictas (an 8926 and a 2309), and I love them both. They are big, heavy, sharp looking, and the Miyota automatic movements are little workhorses that go forever if you take care of them.So when I saw this good-looking Invicta (reminded me of a Rolex GMT) with a sapphire crystal and Swiss movement (albeit quarts) for less than $70, I jumped on it! But when it arrived, I was very disappointed! It was very light and flimsy and lacked the quality build and finish of my other Invictas. It felt cheap on my wrist, and it rattled like a cheesy flea-market watch.So I give it three stars out of respect for Invicta and the fact that it does look good and I did not own it long enough to rate it's performance or reliability. But I was very disappointed in the overall presentation of this watch compared to others. Spend the extra $20 or $30 and get something in the Pro Diver (89xx) series. You won't regret it!"
4,Works.,"Does what it should but after having it for a while, seems pointless. I would not buy it again I would just check my filter visually to see if it needs to be cleaned. Sometimes it shows half plugged right after the filter has been cleaned."
5,Amazon is the cheapest place to buy!,"Reduces waste by not changing out your air filter as often, while at the same time helping to protect your engine by getting every last ounce of filtration out of your air filter!Little known fact: air filters are most efficient right before they become clogged due to the dirt built up on the filter decreasing the size of the passages that more dirt could get through."
1,Worst Book Ever,"Trust me. I've read them all, and this one's the worst.A history book thinly disguised as a novel, this book reads at the pace of molasses sliding down a 3-degree incline. The story ""centers"" around Ali, a fictional character placed in a historical context. However, only a few pages of each chapter actually relates to him. The majority of the book is a bewildered exploration of tangential facts. Every now and then Mottahedeh will simply say, ""Oh, by the way, all the information you could ever want to know about Khomeini's childhood belongs here, right next to Ali's experience at a lecture!"" Or how about a two-page discussion of the definition of a partnership? With stilted dialogue and no plot whatsoever, this book does nothing to educate and even less to amuse."
1,Pretty pictures but no content,This book has lovely photos but absolutly no depth. It is really not much more than a magazine article and definitly not for anyone who has a serious interest in the period.
4,A Worthy Effort,"This is one of the rare cases where I think the prior reviews of this record really nail it. This is a good but not great collection of songs. Most of them lack that something special that transcends the rather ordinary soulful country sound and production. I too bought the album because of the producer who has done outstanding work with Kathleen Edwards and married her as well. The Ontario musicians are all first rate as any fan of the area's music can attest but again most of the songs are a little flat.There are some outstanding tracks however beginning with the Dylan cover and including ""Little White Lies"", ""Down By The Quarry"" and ""Billy"". Ms Ungerleider deserves to be heard and I look forward to exploring more of her music."
1,"Looks great, works poorly","I am a videographer and have purchased 4 of these drives over time. I'm done with LaCie. Two failed after a year and the two remaining are failing now, clicking and clacking and regularly unmounting themselves. They look great! ... designed by a famous guy, but what's inside should last longer than a year!LaCie knows it, and didn't want to look at my failed drives at all. After all, they outlasted the warantee, and that was all that was needed for them.I ended up with some from Mercury (Elite Firewire 800 Pro). They are about the same price, don't look near as good, and work great!Respectfully submitted"
1,Do not buy this drive,"This is the third, and last LaCie drive I will ever own. My first one failed, and unfortunately I had already bought my two others before they also failed. In the end, all three drives that I bought from LaCie have failed. If you do decide to buy one, you might as well get two and use one for backup because it's only a matter of time, just read through some message boards."
1,Just say no to LaCie.,"A few weeks ago I said this drive was excellent. So good that I bought another one.Well I thought the new drive would supplement and not replace the old.A week after I got the new drive, the old one failed. The old one was (naturally) 7 months out of warranty.I've read too many reviews from other LaCie d2 users whose drives also failed.Drives do fail, but not this much.Now I have to buy another drive. It won't be a LaCie, that's for sure."
1,Dead after 3 weeks :(,"Worked great initially. Fast, easy to hook up.Losing 20 Gigs of data on a dead drive within 3 weeks of purchase was not so much fun.If you like gambling and don't mind losing your data, this might be the drive for you.Otherwise, look to a more reliable name."
2,Goodbye to LaCie for me,I have three LaaCie external hard drives. Use them for video storage.bought a new 200 GB drive to store mini DV videos. disk crashed shortly after I put 140 GB on the disk. less than one month after buying it.
3,Too Hard for PC Installation. Okay once installed.,"This item is easy to use once you get it installed, which takes high level PC knowledge. Not at all plug and play for PCs, but maybe MACs. Had to install software supplied and reconfigure PC.Subsequently, we purchased a Seagate 300GB, which was immediately plug and play easy. Never had to install software supplied."
4,"so far, so good","i was hesitant to get this thing, but it came recommended and has yet to hiccup.fingers crossed."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!!!,My drive FAIL after one year and a half...!!! This company really suck BIG TIME....I lost all of my data ...!!! ALL OFF IT...!!! THIS IS THE THIRD ONE THAT FAIL OUT OF FOUR OF THEM I PURCHASED LAST YEAR!!! Total JUNK...!!! NEVER buy a LACIE AGAIN FOR SURE....MAXTOR EXTERNAL IS THE BEST!!!
5,Good Stuff,Amazon delivered the goods right on time and the goods are good. I have been using the LaCie drive for some HD video editing and it has yet to crash or malfunction which is superb.P.S I wish amazon would have made it availible in Canada.
1,Unreliable,"We have been using 5 of these drives via 800 Firewire Interfaces. In less than a year, 1 is dead, click, click, click dead. Another one gives every indication that it is fine however when a backup is written to it, it crawls. The other three seem to be working ok but I am skeptical as to how much longer before I am replacing all 5. These disks should be more reliable!! I am looking elsewhere as we replace the remaining three that are still working."
5,Excellent,The LaCie external hard drive is a usefull tool for all kind of computing appliance. I hadn't any kind of problem with it. It's perfect
2,"Good for a year, Died just after warrenty expired.","I had this drive for a year, and it worked great. had all my files on. Used it as a backup for my laptop, and to hold all my pictures, musics, and DVD backups. It did a great job. up until it died. No warning. I plugged it in one day and I hear this clicking noises. I open it up (Voided the warrenty, if it was still under) and took out the HD and tried it in my tower. No luck. Lost my whole movie collection. Inside it was a seagate barracuda IDE drive.This is a good drive BUT DO NOT COUNT ON IT. and, most importantly, it is not a mobile drive. I'm guessing moving it around to much did it in.I'm buying a LeCie All terrain to replace it."
5,Fantastic external firewire capabilities,I use a MacBook Pro and the LaCie worked like a dream out of the box. Editing directly off the drive in Final Cut Pro is seamless. I recommend to anyone looking for one or two extra storage units. Portability is simple and easy.
1,Don't but it,"I have been a long-time advocate of LaCie. I snubbed my nose at the nay-sayers who complained of the drives. i even doubted that customer service could be this bad. well, i've come around.I own 6 LaCie Drives. 3 have failed me in the last 4 months. LaCie won't take them back, though the did take one in for service, claim the rattling sound of the fan or something was normal, and send it back to me. granted, they called, but only once and they didn't wait to hear back from me before returning the drive unfixed, and i had to pay one-way shipping!i am DONE WITH LACIE. when i told them i'd lost my data, they said i should have had it backed up. wait! that's what this drive was for!!!sorry guys. but i'm done.[...]Amazon has been very helpful and they are going to help me in any way they can. Props for Amazon. but don't buy LaCie. as the last review i read told me before i purchased it anyway, ""it's not a question of if this drive will fail, but when."""
2,"OK headphones, crappy cancelling","I recently purchased these headphones during a Woot Off. I hoped to get a pair of headphones to cancel out distractions while I studies. I definitely got what I paid for as these headphones are lightweight, comfortable, and awful at noise cancellation. When the noise canceling feature is turned on, the volume of the primary signal dramatically decreases. Also, when there is any bass being played the headphones send out an annoying low pulsing that hurts my ears.Overall if you are looking for headphones these are okay, but if you're looking for noise cancellation, pay for a really good pair."
4,Sexy Jazz,Great music from 3 of the greastest erotic films of the 60s. The high part of this album is the lengthy booklet including many pictures from the films. I am a little unhappy that some of the songs have the dialogue included. There is another edition of the Vixen soundtrack that is more complete but is no longer in circulation. Very impressed with Lorna and Faster Pussycat. A great buy for any Russ Meyer fan or filmatic jazz fan.
2,Rest in peace Russ Meyer,"This CD features the soundtracks to three of Russ Meyer's films. Unfortunately, the recording quality isn't very good. The music seems to be taken directly from the films, because most of the tracks have film dialogue over the music. Plus, the music isn't all that great to begin with. Igo Kantor is no Bernard Hermann. Anyway, people don't watch Russ Meyer movies to hear the music. They watch them to see busty women. Fortunately, the booklet that comes with the CD shows many pictures of Russ Meyer's women, with and without clothes. This CD is for Russ Meyer's biggest fans only."
4,Give me GOOD and healthy over 'name brand' any day!,The flavor seems to vary from one pastry to the next. I accredit that to 'natural'. Apples have different tastes. Without artificial flavor added it's all up to nature! Dough/bread products are a favorite of mine anyway. Each one is topped with cinnamon; another favorite of mine. Eat and enjoy!
4,"Not as good as the strawberry, but good none the less","The ""problem"" with natural/organic food is that the heavily process junk we have been taught to eat has ruined it for us. So the organic stuff has to have a lot of natural flavors or it just tastes stale in comparison. Maybe not a totally fair review, but I felt it had to be said."
3,no label online,There is no label online that tells you the carbs and protein etc. These things are just loaded with carbs 40g per tart or 480g carbs per box. This is almost twice as regular pop tarts. They are very good. Just to let everyone know these are not for someone who is trying to lose weight or diabetic.
5,Good good Good,"These toaster pastries have a taste that will grow on you... They taste like apple pie. Not too sweet but just right. Initially only me and my 3 yr old ate them but now everybody in the household enjoys these, not to sweet, snacks."
3,cinnamon lovers only,A good product but I wish that some of the cinnamon was left off the top.Now the price has gone so high I would not buy them again
5,Hard to believe they are good for you!,"Excellent flavor in filling and outer shell. When toasted, crust has a nice crispness too it. Just like ""regular"" Pop Tarts (that I won't buy again BTW), it is hard to eat just one. I will definitely buy these again."
5,Nature's Path should sell ALL their toaster pastries at this price!!!!!,"These are like organic apple pie out of your toaster. With subscribe and save, I payed $16.29 shipped. That is a GREAT deal and CHEAPER than unhealthy and unnatural Pop-Tarts! If Nature's Path brought all the toaster pastry varieties down to this price I would by 100 boxes of each!"
5,"Another great ""economy"" recording that's on par with any.","Some of my favorite recordings are NAXOS recordings, and this is one of them. If CDs wore out like old LPs did, I would have to buy another one of these. The performance is great, particularly the two Rondos, and I think the technical quality is as good an any found on even the most expensive disks. This would be a bargin at three times the price!"
2,hugely disappointing,"What happened? This album amounts to a mid-life crisis. One of the things I've always worshipped about Liz Phair was her capacity for innovative lyrics and sound.. these songs don't even sound smart. I guess the pix in the CD say it all... and it's just sad that someone so creative and groundbreaking felt that at this stage she needed to espouse what is now so commonplace in female ""rock."" My only hope is that she returns to what she does best-- because in that arena she's still tops."
1,Could it be ...?,"This is a dreadful album. Phair has squandered every ounce of her indie credibility, and produced an album that doesn't even work on its own obviously very hit oriented terms. There are benefits to selling out, but I can't imagine that she is going to reap any of them with this slick, processed junk. This is the first disc that I have bought in a long time where I actually feel cheated."
5,One of the Best CD's I Own,It's impossible not to like this. It's full of catchy rock ballads and the Michael Penn Beatle-esque influence is evident via tasty guitar licks and melodies.Liz Phair is simply one of the best kept rocker secrets we have going.
4,Ignore the critics - Liz still writes great songs,"Let's give this whole sell-out notion a rest - this is Ms. Phair continuing to write provocative and honest songs with great rock sensibilities. If you loved Guyville, Whip Smart and/or WhiteChocolateSpaceEgg, you will enjoy Extraordinary, Rock Me, WHC and others.Yes, more of the songs (particularly the Matrix produced) are commercially accessible, but that doesn't automatically make them bad. Sure, Why Can't I sounds like Avril, but an Avril that is 15 years older, divorced and raising a young son on her own. The lyrics remain engaging and poignant.The more I listen to this record, the more I prefer it to her past efforts. I respect Ms. Phair for moving onward and upward - and I particularly for providing us a damn good record. Now if we could only get her to do a record with Paul Westerberg, I could die a happy man..."
3,"NOT ""Extraordinary""","Let's put it this way...my eight-year-old listens to this one, I listen to Exile in Guyville. Very professional, very slick, very listenable, and very...disposable. There's nothing here that's as authoritatively confrontational as ""6'1"""" or as wrenching as ""Divorce Song."" It's a lot of posturing. As for THE MATRIX, well, they can do wonders with a little girl like Avril, but Liz really doesn't need their help."
1,A New Low!,"Possibly the worst CD I have purchased in the last decade. Terrible music, laughable lyrics, and over-the-top bubblegum production. It was nice knowing you Liz..."
1,Is this Liz Phair or Britney Spears?,"Rarely do I buy a CD that's so bad I refuse to listen to it for a second time and give it a chance. This is one of those rarities. If you're an existing fan of Liz Phair - DON'T BUY THIS CD! It appears Liz wants to join the ranks of over-produced, talentless pop princesses. Why? She must need the money. It's just so sad. I have more respect for Michelle Branch. Buy her album instead; it's much better than this piece of garbage."
3,"Good, but not great.","On one hand, I'm glad to hear Liz's songs pop up in cheesy romantic comedies and get heavy rotation on any one of the ""today's best commercialized wonders"" radio stations across the country. She deserves it. On the other hand, I'm sad to see her music lose some of its appeal to long time listeners. Yes, there are nauseating pop ditties on this album, the ever over-played ""Why can't I?"" and the unabashedly appealing ""Good love never dies"". But there are hints of the old Liz. ""H.W.C."" is just as tongue-in-cheek as older favorites and ""Rock me"" has a certain listen-live appeal. But I definitely recommend ""Whitechocolatespaceegg"" and ""Whip-smart"" over this one, though it's certainly not the worst album of the decade. Overall, 3.5."
2,"Avril, Pink, with a side of Madonna and a dash of Britney","Just thinking about the existence of this album propels me to listen to ""Exile in Guyville"" very, very loud in celebration of the brash, assertive, intimate voice that single-handedly personified female heterosexuality."
2,Liz or Avril?,"All the critics have said it, and for once they're right: This album sounds like Avril Lavigne. Really. Almost no difference. A couple of songs start out sounding like Liz, but they quickly fall back into pop-formula predictablilty.If you like Avril Lavigne, you'll love this album. It sounds like Avril grown up and more edge to the lyrics. If you like Liz Phair, go dig out the first three albums and enjoy them."
4,"Not too serious, just fun","I guess if you're hung up on having ""indy cred"" this record may not be for you - but the production is sugary sweet and Liz delivers with an album that will make you roll down the windows, roll back the sunroof and put the pedal on the floor."
4,It's Phair,"Although Liz might have strayed farthest away from her Guyville days with this album, she's still her witty self with songs like ""Hot White Cum,"" and lines like ""Your record collection don't exist, you don't even know who Liz Phair is,"" in ""Rock Me,"" a song about dating a fairly younger man, and loving it.A lot of fans were down on Liz for her new more ""popish"" venture on this album, but there is much to be appreciated here. It's a must for any open minded Liz fan, and a good start for those who aren't familiar with her. The songs are catchy, it's still Liz... it's a great album."
2,Call Explicit Explicit,"There is little saving grace in this collection of explicit lyrics and images. I'm not a prude. I know where all the explicit lyrics are on Jefferson Airplane albums. I've got copies of The Fugs and the Mothers of Invention in my collection. And even Judy Collins has been sensational, in her day.But this is like listening to a high school sophomore trying to be sexy. The music is, at best, jelly bean. Her voice is a little sultry. But the images here, the lyrics here are just plain crude.I've read Henry Miller, and be it Capricorn or Cancer, those tropics leave nothing to anyone's imagination. Liz is at best a fair pornographer. She wants to be a bad girl. She doesn't have a prayer. She hasn't had enough Wild Turkey in her life to know what it really is like."
1,Bland,"Yes, sexy cover, but this is one of the most bland albums I have heard in a long time. I guess trying to go mainstream requires that. Too bad.One song after another; musicially uninteresting, shallow bland lyrics ('Rock Me' is a perfect example).Not worth a second listen.Too bad.I guess this is what it takes to get a hit record these days."
1,Liz Phair gone terribly wrong,"This is the worst Liz Phair album to date. Liz decided to trade in her unqiue lyrics for cliches instead. Now we get 'baby, baby, baby, if it's alright/I want you to rock me all night' or 'why can't I breathe whenever I think about you?/why can't I speak whenever I talk about you?' I have no problem when an artist wants to go mainstream. Hey I can't blame Liz for wanting to get a little media attention. Almost a decade in hiding with three wonderful albums that the America public doesn't know about. Sure she deserved more recognition. But why is it in our society that an artist has to wipe away any of the artistic integrity they had to begin with and replace it with a new style to conform? This is one of the worst albums of 2003 (along with Jewel's) and you should not get it. For better music check out older Liz Phair, PJ Harvey, Veruca Salt, and Hole."
1,"sell out, with liz ,oh yeah","remember when liz phair wrote interesteing, creative, personal songs and stories? Remember when her musical and singing styles were interesting and original? Well, Liz finally gave in and decided musical integrity wasn't important, so she watered everything down for the money. Don't buy this album, it's terrible."
3,Not the Liz her fans were waiting for,"I don't hate this album, but I am very disappointed at whomever at her recording label that decided to release extra songs on Windows Media, available to the people who bought the CD when you put it into your CD drive.These ""extra"" songs are the Liz we all know and love and were treated as afterthoughts. You can't even put these on a recordable CD to listen in the car, they have made that impossible- you can only listen to it on your computer. Unfortunately I listen to my music in the car.They have gone too far this time. Shame."
2,Utterly disappointing.,"No one can blame Liz Phair for wanting sh**loads of money and trying to make a successful pop album. But the Matrix-produced tracks on this CD are just insipid and irritating. Even many of the non-Matrix tracks, with the exception of ""Little Digger,"" disappoint. I hope this album does well, so that she won't wait another five years before releasing her next CD. Because for long-time fans, the best that can be done now is to keep listening to Exile, Whip-Smart, Juvenilia, and WCSE, and hope Liz' next album will be better than this one."
1,Big disappointment,"I've been a fan since I heard Guyville and I had high expectations when I heard a new disc was coming out. I'm sorry but this one leaves me limp. I can understand an artist needing to grow,but Liz has changed into a banal, talentless mess. Lacking wit and sophistication that have been her trademarks, she has made a disc lacking in any emotion or flair."
1,disappointed,"maybe it's just me, but it seems like Liz Phair could use some help with her singing. I got this record from my cousin, and Liz looks pretty good on the front cover, so I was interested - but then I was real disappointed with the music. maybe she oughta put on some clothes & learn to sing."
2,Vastly disappointing...,"I like Liz Phair. Only, I'm talking about ""Exile in Guyville"" Liz Phair. I love that CD. I adore it. Songs like ""F*ck and Run"" and ""The Divorce Song"" and ""Help Me Mary"" were so honest and so truthful, I couldn't help but love them. But this CD...it was your typical, sugary pop music. And I think if you take this album, and listen to it without ever knowing about Liz Phair's past records, it's OK. ""Why Can't I?"" is infectious and easily gets stuck in your head. ""Friend of Mine"" seems kind of earnest and honest, and I found the lyrics very easy to relate to. ""Rock Me"" is funny. But if you put this next to ""Exile in Guyville,"" it's a shame, a really unfortunate shame. It doesn't even hold a candle to it."
1,life lessons ...,"Liz Phair has entered a new phase in her life with this release. Earlier on, she was the sexually-liberated young woman, showing every girl that what's good for the gander is good for the goose, and more so. The optimistic among her audience hoped that as she grew older, she'd grow wiser and satisfied, abandoning the impulse to sow oats just as wild as her male counterparts.Unfortunately, she is now giving lie to the myth of female sexual liberation. Certainly, this is unintentional on her part - she'll realize it far too late. But for those of us on the outside, we now see very clearly what comes of all this - not a confident, strong, independent woman, but a grovelling, used-up (...). Much luck to Little Digger, the unfortunate first in a long line of children to wonder who is using their mother - he'll need it. One might be inclined to offer luck to Phair as well, but she wouldn't know what to do with it if she got it; she's still championing the life on the back, spread eagle."
1,Embarassing mess,"When I bought the CD I failed to see the parental warning label. It is kind of dark on a dark background. I bought the cd, and started to play it in my car with the volume low because my family was visiting and we were talking. When I dropped them off at the hotel, I turned up the volume and nearly blushed. I am not a prude, but I also don't need to listen to vulgar language for entertainment. I Can only imagine what would have occured if my family heard the lyrics, I would be mortified. If I were you, stick to Annie Lennox's Bare or the new Lucinda Williams. Leave this one on the shelf."
1,"oh my god.. buy avril instead, she's better!!!!","i think this is the biggest sellout ($$$$) piece of garbage i've ever heard in my life.. even ""little digger"" which is supposed to be some emotional opus of the album is emotionless, sterile.. garbage (and can you tell which other female singer's melody she rips off? hint: ""she says days go by.."") it's all garbage. god save us from this wreck.(p.s. the avril lavigne cd really is much better)"
1,Seems desperate to me-,"Very disappointed. Heard her on NPR and she seems to be getting a bit desperate as her career progresses. Album has 2 good classic Phair tunes other than that she sounds like a whiner. As a women, I would say grow up- if you even start going down the Allanis Morrosette road- Don't, you would be a sell-out and let us all down as women. Who cares- you like sex!!!!!"
2,Why oh why?,"I can put Liz Phair's first three albums in my player and rotate them nonstop for a week. They're brilliant, full of feeling, with unexpected hooks around every corner.I don't know if Liz ""sold out"" with this album as many people believe. I like lush production, that's not the problem here. The problem is that the songs are just average at best. Boring. I've really tried to get into this album and while there are a few tracks I liked a lot at first they got old really quickly. After waiting so long for a new album, I think this may be the most disappointing CD I've ever purchased.Her new CD is out today, and I don't care. I'd never have believed that were possible before the disappointment that was ""Liz Phair""."
2,"whitechocolatespacegg, track 15, anybody?","Liz Phair wants to be a pop star so she picks the most wretched of the current batch (that would be Avril Lavigne, if you can't tell) to emulate? After waiting so many years since whitechocolatespacegg, which was my first Liz Phair CD and one of my favorites in my whole collection, this is a massive disappointment. There are a four or five tracks in the second half of the album that actually sound like Liz had something to do with them, but even then, they come across as weak, filler-ish attempts compared to what we're used to from her. Maybe this selling-out technique will work, (if it does, I guess we can't blame her - after all, who doesn't like money?) and the people who enjoy Avril will like this, but I have to say that I'm hoping for a flop if that's what it takes to get her to release a good album again."
2,What Happened?,"When I first heard this album, I almost fell off my chair. The song content was the same old, same old, but it was presented in a whiny, adolescent, user-friendly format that seemed to come from Liz Phair's younger, worse-songwriter sister than from Phair herself.The mirth from ""Exile"" is gone, and what's left is a rehash of the old material, like the revamping of ""Flower"" (sold as ""H.W.C.""), and some profanity to deviate from totally sounding like Avril Lavigne.This isn't Liz Phair, because I know that Liz Phair would never do anything as embarrassing as this album. At the end of the CD, the question presented itself: whatever happened to the real Liz Phair?"
2,Life isn't phair.,My Top 5 fun musical jokes over the last few years:1. Pat Boone does heavy metal.2. Paul McCartney does trance.3. The Monkees reunite again.4. Cyndi Lauper makes another album at all.5. Liz Phair does an album with the Matrix.All are worth some laughs; none are really worth any money.
3,candy coated,"On her last album ""whitechocolatespaceegg"" Liz sang, ""it's nice to be liked, but better by far to be payed."" I always took it as irony but it appears she was singing from the heart. You can take this album and file under sellout. It is a very definitive attempt to jump on to the bandwagon and ride it to the bank. This album as a whole is like a giant characterization of what Liz Phair was. From the semi-nude album cover to the token vulgar song. It's like Liz Phair airbrushed and shined up for success.And the music?A little background on me...I love girl pop music. I know that Avril is flippant and shallow but I can't help but hum along with her music. Mandy Moore always puts a smile on my face. I love the songs on this album! They are good pop tunes. I hate the fact Liz Phair is behind them.A Side Note: This really makes me appreciate Kristin Hersh who has stated she would rather be a waitress then to right banal radio-friendly music."
2,2 stars for Liz Phair is still a good record,"Been a fan since '93. I think about half the record is good, half bad. Can't listen all the way through.Be interesting to see her live. Probably have a better opinion of these songs without the bells and whistles and her real voice."
2,So disappointing,"I've been a Phair fan since Exile in Guyville and I have to admit that I couldn't have been more disappointed with this latest album. I know a lot of people disliked whitechocolatespaceegg but I thought it was okay and could lead to new directions for Phair. If I had known it would have led to Avril Lavigne (which is unfair to Phair, the lyrics are more complex than anything sk8ter queen Lavigne could imagine) I would have slammed it more. The best way to describe this new album as is the female equivalent of having a midlife crisis and buying a sports car or getting hair replacement surgery. It's ugly and sad in men and it's ugly and sad in women. The song ""Rock Me"" was okay though."
4,"A big change, but one that gets better with time","Simply put: it's really different from earlier albums, but one that old and new fans will both like. I was fortunate to see Liz at Bonnaroo in mid-June, and on the way down I listened to an advance copy of this CD. I was surprised at the difference from previous CDs, but as time has passed I have grown to like this CD as much as her previous album, WCSE. The opening track, Extraordinary, is really catchy, and Little Digger is quite touching. You might find that the most catchy song, HWC, is not one you want to sing in public once you read the lyrics. However, Love/Hate [Transmission] is perhaps the most provocative song. I would recommend this very enjoyable CD for fans of her previous albums, and for new fans; both will find a talented artist who continues to sing her mind and write very good songs. Now, if only Liz would release a DVD with all of her videos!"
1,Wow...how horrible...how sad.,"Liz, its your choice to wanna be a pop star, but its my choice to buy any more of your records.For those of you not familiar with Ms. Phair's real music, give this album a pass and listen to anything she did before this."
2,my dear liz phair...,"The thing I (used to) love about Liz Phair's music is that at first you don't really like it and then you listen and listen and it grows and grows on you. Every song on this album was easy listening - bad sign. I can't get the songs out of my head and I want to!If she'd only not had such lame backing music and vocal synthesis I think the album would be OK - it's as though she wrote these interesting tunes with her guitar and handed them over to her producers saying ""butcher me, baby!"".It's really disapointing - at best, a wider audience will be attracted to her music now and she might get some more worthy recognition for her brilliant first three albums."
4,A Stellar Pop-Rock CD,"Those critics (New York Times, SF Weekly, Bay Guardian--I'm talking about you) who felt the need blast this CD from the front pages of their respective publications need to get a grip. While this record isn't the revelation that Exile in Guyville was, it nonetheless is provocative, intelligent, moving and a lot more fun than her previous work. There are only 4 Matrix productions and with the exception of the rather bland ""Why Can't I"", the others are catchy, propulsive rockers that manage to retain Liz's edge and quirky charm. These are songs that you want to blast from the car radio. I've been a diehard Liz fan for 10 years and unlike the scorned critics, I'm glad Liz realizes that radio does not have to be the enemy."
2,Return to your roots Liz!,"Liz should maybe have listened to Exile in Guyville before making this album. A disappointing effort from someone who has so much talent. Trying to go Avril Lavigne-ish doesn't work for her, unfortunately. It is still nice to see that she does try hard to be the 'old' Liz Phair, but, I think it is purely an act."
3,Will the REAL Liz Phair please stand up!!!,"What a shame that in 5 years Liz Phair has become the over produced pop star that she isn't! I very reluctantly gave this album three stars. I think some of the song have potential if they were not so over produced and did not sound like your typical top 40 radio garbage. I have been listening to Liz since Guyville, and with each subsequent release keep wondering why she is squandering her talent. I am starting to think she only had one really great album in her. I was so put off by this album at first that I almost tossed it out the car window! fortunatly if you are able ot get to track 6 thing start to sound a little more realistic. I actually burned the 10 track that I though were okay, and I'm selling the thing this weekend to put toward something better! Liz please do us all a favor and come to your senses!"
1,It does not get much worse than this,"I have been a devoted Liz Phair fan since she began. While Whip-Smart and Whitechocolatespaceegg never matched her brilliant Exile in Guyville all three are great alblums and will always have constant play on my stereo. Whoever advisesd her to put out a pop alblum has made the biggest mistake since New Coke. What is next? Joe Jackson doing gangsta rap? Portishead putting out a polka alblum? There is not one redeeming quailty to this pop hororr. I suppose her song H.W.C. is her nod to her bad girl past, but it does not work when set to a tune that Tiffany would be comfertable singing. I will always love Liz, she is stunning and talented. I just hope that as Coke quickly recognized the erorr of their ways when they changed their formula, Liz will also come to her senses and issue another alblum to help rinse the horrid taste of this one from my ears."
1,Horrible CD,"I can't believe I wasted my money on this lousy wannabe album. Liz is in her late 30s and she thinks she can suddenly be teeny popstar Avril Laguine...yuck! Her lyrics make me cringe, her singing is pathetically overdone and the songs are like nursery rhymes. I can't think of any other artist that has completely erased her credibilty this quickly. You better put out a great record real soon, Liz, or your fifteen minutes are up. Sorry, but that's what you get for humiliating yourself for the almighty $$$."
1,If you like this album ... you have no soul,"If this is good music to you, I have some bad news: Your taste in music is horrible. This is over-produced garbage. It's everything music shouldn't be. If you actually like this album, and you're more than 12 years old, your friends are making fun of you behind your back. Sorry, the truth hurts. Save yourself while you still can."
4,good album,"i really like this album. Liz Phair is pretty talented. if you're looking for something similar to her debut ""Exile in guyville"" you will probably be disapointed. this is more pop rock, but still VERY good. H.W.C makes me laugh. lol. it's so catchy though, make sure u don't sing it in public or anything :P but all in all i really like this cd and i don't understand why so many ppl complain about it, sure she changed her style, but if u think about it, all her cd's kind of had a different sound to them. so go check out this cd, if you like it you like it, if you don't, you dont."
1,Avril? Britney?,"""why can't I?"" is the best song Avril Lavigne has put out this year!!What?You say that Avril didn't do that song? Hmmmm. What the heck happened to Liz Phair?I guess she had some bills to pay."
1,oh boy,"Liz is ok, she has potential for alot of singles on this album. I personally like ""it's sweet"" but nothing else made me want to take a second listen. She likes to sing about sex. wow. sos does everyone else in this business. She is ok, just not great."
4,"im jus ur average,everday,sane,pyscho ,supergoeddess","this cd is ur average pyscho. sane and a supergoddess at the same timeliz has a mix of love and hate mixed together in her song ""Extraoridinary""and all the love in her other songsshe gives all the things a one gurl revolution needs!buy this cd!"
4,Indie Rock,"This album is definately different from her last album but it is worth listening to. Her single ""Why Can't I"", although sounding ""poppy"" it still has that ""Alternative Rock"" sound to it, which is very cool. I would recommend this CD (It might not be one of your favorites but it is still a great CD.)"
5,Outstanding,"Listened to it yesterday, and could not stop playing it - I love all of her albums and see this as part of her evolution - better sound quality and a great great great voice."
4,Not your average everyday sane pyscho,"It's very good but a little too pop. You can't really say it's commercial because rock is no longer the mainstream, but it lacks the edge of earlier efforts. That being said, Liz is a far cry from Ms. Spears, and for that, we can all be thankful."
4,Pop music for grown-ups,"I'm a big Liz Phair fan who was pretty cautious of her newer, more refined (i.e. pop) sound but I love this album. She retains the edge that made her famous but rocks out in a very fun way. This is pop music for people who think they're too cool for pop music. I think the thing I love most is the upfront and confident sexuality she displays. Young pop princesses who flaunt their sexuality are a dime a dozen. But on this album, Liz shows them how a real woman does it. I have worn grooves into this CD from listening to it so much."
3,Not so bad! (and Michael Penn rules),"As the typical ""Guyville"" fan, I was expecting to hate this album. Yet---it's so darn catchy! (I'm a little angry that Liz Phair would waste a good tune like ""H.W.C"" has with stupid lyrics it's embarrassing to sing along with. No karaoke there.)Mainly, though, after having read many reviews of this album, I would just like to point out that all the best tracks, where Phair sounds most like her old self, were produced by MICHAEL PENN. Enough about the stupid ""Matrix"" already. Penn is an amazing and quirky songwriter in his own right, and I'm not surprised that he and Liz Phair make a successful team. I suspect that his involvement is what makes this a 3-1/2 star album instead of a 1-1/2 star one."
4,Not THAT Bad...,"Some of this cd is really good (Bionic Eyes, Rock Me), some of it is embarassing (HMC, Favorite). No, it isn't Exile or even Whipsmart, my favorite Liz cd. But for being an attempt at going mainstream, its better than a lot of the crap out there like Britney or even Avril Lavigne. Its better than whitechocolatespaceegg, that's for sure. But if you are looking for gritty girl-rock, this isn't where to look. Pick up the aforementioned Exile in Guyville or the slightly more user-friendly Whipsmart."
4,"It's different, but it's Liz and it's good","I've been a fan of Liz since Exile and Girlysounds and this album got pretty well ripped by critics and (unfortunately) the fans.I love the old albums, all of them, and I like this album a lot. It isn't as sharp (lyrically) as the earlier ones and it is far more lushly produced, but I don't think that's a terrible thing. The sex songs aren't angry or sad, they're fun and happy and maybe Liz has grown up enough to realize that sex can be like that.If you want to be sullen, go listen to Exile. This is Liz becoming more of a veteran, mainstream musician. No one can remain a fringe, alt-goddess forever.It may have the same beats as the mindless sugar pop songs, but Liz can't help but give her material more depth than that. This album is worth owning."
2,this is what happens when the music biz takes charge,"So sad to hear this album after the wonderful Whitechocolatespaceegg. I can only surmise that her a&r rep said, ""look honey, we're going to do things our way this time."" This CD is like if Wilco had listened to their record comany on YHF and reworked the songs until the record company liked them. Thank God Wilco didn't, but it sounds like Liz Phair did! So sad."
1,Look out Britney Spears!,"I am a big fan of old Liz Phair.Unfortunately, with this album, Ms. Phair's lyrics have been reduced to predictable cliches and her sound is over-produced and has lost any splendor and unpredictability it once had.The result is an album that owes more to Britney Spears and other teeny-pop than any of Liz Phair's previous work. You'll find my copy with many others on the used rack at Amoeba Records in Hollywood."
4,Just doesn't sound like her!,I've been a fan now for three years and when her new album came out I was so excited. After putting it on I felt it wasn't what I expected. It just doesn't sound like her. Don't get me wrong it's a good album but just not Liz phair's! I'm also a fan of Michelle Branch and it sounds more like her music. The song writing used to make you think and every time I listened to a song I would find something I hadn't noticed. She was witty and creative with her lyrics. Now they are good but they give you less to think about. I'm still a fan and I do recommend this album to anyone who isn't an indie Pop fan but if you are than go with whip-smart or exile in guyville before you get this one.
3,B.P.O.C.,"That stands for ""Big Piece of Cheese,"" which is a fair way to describe this record.It's very ordinary. The songs aren't especially catchy or strong, and the entire thing sounds overdone on the production side and perfunctory on the performance end."
4,UnPhair,"Very tempered effort by one of my top 3 favorite female artists.I get the feeling that there is just way less Liz here than in previous releases. Liked pretty much all the tracks, and I must say that Little Digger literally brought tears to my eyes- I am abolutely not the type to crumble at well written lyrics.I am pretty sure that this will not replace whitechocolatespaceegg in my heart, but is definitely in the rotation. Buy it."
3,It's pretty obvious that. . .,". . . with the release of this cd Liz is getting attention: you are either for her or against her.The amazing thing is the degree to which 'Liz Phair' polarizes the listening audience. People either love it or hate it. Very few are actually taking it for face value - a pop album. And if that's what Liz wanted, that's exactly what she delivered.Sure, gone are all the trappings, or lack thereof, of whatever it was that made whole room fulls of angst ridden, 20-something indie 'critics' dressed in black swoon. Well, SO WHAT!?She devotes herself to this album. She sings better than she ever has before ( so what if she DOES sound like Advil Le-whatever... ) It's still Liz in there. It's polished, sometimes overly so, but again - So WHAT?It's a good, solid pop album. And she should be commended for it.If Exile in Guyville was what you were looking for AGAIN, then buy that and listen to it over, and over, and over, and over."
1,DO NOT BUY CLEAN VERSION...,"Do not buy this. Liz Phair censored is like a car with no gas. First off the whole song of H.W.C. is gone, which was a great song. I can't even imagine the rest of the songs and how they got butchered. Just buy the Explicit version..so what she says F*ck once or twice. Please. So get out now and buy the real thing."
2,An Exorcism Has Taken Place!!!,"Liz, The Lovable Liz Of F and Run and Supernova. Joltin Joe has gone away, hey hey hey, hey hey hey. This record sounds like a Sheryl Crow CD all polished up with turtle wax!!! ""Why Can't I"" who cares if you like the younger guys Liz lovem all and get over it and make that tough, rough music you used to make!!! EXTRAORDINARY...NOT!!! The best thing about the CD is the CD cover and it's not even original, Carly Simon did it first. Come Back Liz, Come Back!"
5,Excellent - Phair continues to reinvent herself,"Another great album from Liz Phair. Excellent. I've been listening to it for weeks, and still am thoroughly enjoying it.I've been a big fan of Liz Phair for years now. Each album is unique and she's constantly evolving and changing - but with her same trademark gritty indie sound.As with her last couple albums, the top 40 song (in this case, Why Can't I) is not a good reflection of her style or of the album.If you just like that song, you may be shocked at her profanity and sometime harsh lyrics. I love that about her music - but if you can't stomach profanity in the main chorus lines or songs about sex and being a woman - then you might not enjoy.If you listen with an open mind, then I think you'll appreciate her talent."
5,"Sexy, Bold, and Beautiful. The music is good too...","What lots of reviewers seem to forget is that there are a lot of people who have heard of Liz Phair, but have not heard her music until this album. I took a chance and downloaded it off of the iTunes music store. I have the advantage of not comparing it to her previous work.It is extremely good and stands on it's own. She says she is now doing the kind of music she loved while growing up. She actually sounds like she is enjoying herself instead of playing ""the tortured artist, trying to be cool so all the esoteric record reviewers would like her"" songwriter/performer.I give her 5 stars for courage and the balls to lose a few older fans to gain millions of new ones!The only downside to this music... It does not leave my head!"
2,lollipop,This CD is not the Liz Phair i know and love! It is too lollipop to be Liz. Turn on any pop radio station and that is what you'll hear on this CD. I regret buying it.
2,"She only wrote 60% of the songs, & the Internet EP stinks","60% of the songs = 3 or 5 stars, but I took off one star because the lizphair.com website (currently) is a joke. Had she writren all of the songs, this could have been a five star album (well, rock me [stinks], IMHO), posibly as good as Exile. Also, Windows users can burn the Internet EP to a CD used Media Player 9, but the protected asf file cant be converted to a wav, so it can't be played on a regular home stereo. You're paying for those 5 songs by the way, but you can't use them. If Capitol Records, or whomever, would do like Wilco and The Dead have done and make the Internet EP available as MP3 or shn files, then this would be less of a rip-off."
1,what happened to liz phair?,"if you're looking for liz phair, you're not going to find her on this cd. she has completely lost her edge on this album. lyrics are plain, soft, and they all seem to have a popish melody. however, if you're into the teenage radio pop music, you might enjoy this album?"
3,Sellout? Probably. But it's still a great album.,"I have been a Liz fan for a few years now, and I can see where the people who hate this album are coming from. The production is a lot slicker than Exile or Whip-Smart and the cover does leave something to be desired, but it doesn't change the fact that this is really good songwriting. Ok, maybe it doesn't have as much depth as her former work, but any album that can get stuck in my head all day has to be doing something right. Liz Phair is trying something different on this album and I love it. And for all of you music snobs that can't take anything that's pop-oriented, go listen to Exile and let the rest of us enjoy ourselves."
1,A Huge Disappointment,"Ater waiting years for this album I was aghast to learn that the Matrix poppers were given control over the destiny of this album. The result: an over-produced banal album with nary a shred of the artistic originality that made me fall in love with all of Liz's previous work.Oh well, I guess she needed the money."
4,"Very Good, Just Not What She Was","Okay, if this were Liz Phair's first album, everyone would be all over it with compliments. But because she's changed a bit in the last ten years, everyone's complaining. Stop. It's a great CD -- a continuation of where she was going after whitechocoloate... but, of course, she's worlds away from where she was ten years ago. Aren't you?"
4,Get this for the downloadable mini-album,"I'll state some facts first, so everyone knows where I'm coming from. Out of all her releases, I like whitechocolatespaceegg best. Whipsmart next, and Exile next.This CD isn't all bad, it has a few tunes that survived long enough to make it to my iPod. What's truly telling is that I can't remember the song names, and somehow I still enjoy those songs.But what I truly love is the downloadable songs - 5 great songs that definately add a star or two to this Album's rating.I normally don't review stuff that has 7 bazillion reviews already, but I made an exception because I don't think everyone has tried the mini-LP yet."
1,as bad as you've heard,"... Apart from pure money grubbing cynicism, that's the only possible explanation for the brilliantly insightful ironist of previous albums coming up with [weak songs] like ""Rock Me"" or that ... underwear song. The sad thing is that, rather than sounding like Avril Lavigne, as she's apparently trying to do, Liz sounds like Avril trying to sound like Liz Phair (instead of her cute, spunky teenaged self) and failing miserably. Basically, this is the worst thing I've bought since washed up 60's bands tried to make themselves relevant with tinkly synthesizers and drum machines in the 80's. I can only hope that commercial failure will lead Liz back to what she's good at."
4,Yummy,"All you have to know about ""Liz Phair"" is that it's a great album. OK, not all the songs are ""whitechocolatespaceegg"" amazing but there ARE a few BRILLIANT tracks. The best part is that it's still delivered in the dripping wet sexy voice you've come to know and love - it's just a little glossier. Buy it. Who cares who produced or if it's gonna get played on the radio. Oh ya, don't miss the video for ""Why Can't I?"" it's a beautiful piece of art direction not to mention a great pop song."
1,Sounds,"like a bunch of Alanis Morrisette covers. Ugh!!How can this be the same person who wrote ""Exile in Guyville""? The bottom line here is that this is NOT the maturing of an artist, but an artist trying to cash in. If you like EIG, or even WCSE, this is tripe."
1,Don't Even Bother,"Sorry - I'm with the other ""old Liz"" fans out there - unless you're into teen movie soundtracks and all the other under-talented over-produced BS on the radio these days - don't buy this cd! I loved her other stuff and am open to artists growing and changing, but she took a step back on this one. Total disappointment - the only saving grace is I didn't pay for this CD - I'd have been even more ruthless if actual money had been paid to purchase it. BLAH BLAH BLAH is pretty much the way this cd listens... All you need to do is look at the 40 USED available for $7.40, etc...that's a LOT of people ready to sell this one back for half the cost."
3,hello radio!,as a long time listener and fan of phair's talent i must say the recording is on an extremely higher level of production and many of the tracks will be eaten by radio and media. i was hoping a lot of the tracks did not sound like someone else but unfortunately they do. nice to hear new material but i'm waiting for the real liz phair.
3,Mainstream woes,"First off, I AM a Liz Phair fan. This album however was a bit of a disappointment. Liz does a more popmusic album aimed towards the mainstream audience in an already diluted market. Unfortunately for her, it does not stand out enough to gain much momentum and she probably lost a few accustomed fans with this attempt. I was in high hopes that she would have made a bigger splash just so I can hear more of her music. Her older albums were much better and far more unique."
4,"Don't believe the ""sellout"" talk","Liz hasn't changed her style so much as altered it. This album is a bit more hook friendly, but it's not as though she's suddenly transformed into Avril Lavigne or Britney Spears. Instead of singing the chorus twice, it's now about four times. Wow, what a sellout. Her lyrics are still great and carry depth and she's still the best artist around. I admit that Liz isn't for everyone, but if you've liked her in the past you shouldn't hesitate to buy this album."
5,Welcome back Liz Phair,"It seems like every CD reviewer out there decided to compare Liz Phair's new album to the new crop of singers out there. Sure she had help from the Matrix. What's wrong with that? I bought this CD because I liked her older stuff, not because I was hoping to hear songs that sounded like Avril. All of the tracks on this CD are great. I think it's great that she took some new steps in her writing. Both Liz Phair and Jewel decided to try something different and both hit home runs. I know that the new stuff is going to make the die-hard fans angry. I figure, it doesn't matter if it's Liz, Jewel, Avril, Gwen, Michelle or any number of female singers. If I like the song, I like the song."
1,Can you say mid-life crisis?!,"SO disappointing! I love Liz Phair--she has always seemed so talented and innovative...until now. I have worn out my Exile in Guyville and Whitechocolatespaceegg CDs, but this new album...well let's just say, you should look for several copies in the ""used CDs"" bin at your local record store. The only song that sounds like Liz is ""Little Digger"", the rest of it sounds like radio-pop senseless crap. I'm so disappointed. I hope Liz is happy with her new, Britney-like fans, because she will certainly lose her old fans if this is a sign of things to come."
1,I can't believe it's Liz Phair..,"I've been listening to Liz Phair since I was about 14, so, give or take 10 years. She always had a big following among the bi-sexual, lesbian, outcast teenage girls I knew. This album is a complete sell-out, it's everything that she seemed to be against. Her older music is funny, intelligent, witty, insightful and comforting to girls and women who aren't like everybody else. This is just like everything else you hear from the pop music scene. Her other albums are unique, unforgetable, and I have some that are scratched up from years of use that I still listen to. This is just embarassing, and I guess she was hoping that people would like it, or that she would gain a wider audience, but I think she just succeeded in losing her old one."
1,"Nope, just doesn't cut it.","I'm not a suck up what most people seem to do. I'm glad Liz is getting more publicity and all, but let's be honest, the music in her new album is just lousy. The lyrics she's known for doesn't quite fit in to the Top 40 pop genre. ...She's basically dumping her fans that knew her from the beginning and making herself a clone of Avril Lagine. Shame really she's selling herself out with these songwriters named ""The Matrix"" (original name, isn't it?) and attempting to go make a quick buck. I'm not gonna sit here and B.S. saying ""Her new pop sound is amazing and slick as ever."" It just doesn't work out that way. I've been a big fan since Exile In Guyville and this self-titled album is one big slap in the face. ... You just ruined the career of a very talented singer."
2,Falls Flat,"Like everything else with the words ""The Matrix"" attached to it in 2003, Liz Phairs attempt to transform herself into Avril Lavigne is disappointing for several reasons. The songs aren't that good or even that catchy--which is, after all, why you have The Matrix write your songs in the first place. They sound trite, something Phair should be ashamed of after her auspicious debut. Worst of all, she's trying so hard to sell out--and failing. Attempted humor and poignance fall equally flat. If you're a fan of Liz Phair circa 1992 you'll find very little here."
1,"Seriously, this makes me cry.","I have given this album a good 6 months or so, having owned it digitally since before it was released. And I am disappointed, to say the least. Admittedly I have a ridiculous emotional attachment to Ms. Phair's earlier work, but this is ridiculous. I fully support an artist's wish to do different work and sell more records, but if I wanted to listen to Sheryl Crow I would buy her albums. This is nothing new. We have seen all this before. I can't appreciate the hints at intelligent songwriting due to the nauseating production, i.e. ""Little Digger."" ""HWC"" is equivalent to ""Girls Gone Wild"" at best, no sexual revolution here. The harmonica just makes it worse. And laughable.I can only hope this is a marketing ploy and the next Liz Phair album will showcase the lyrics and rock'n'roll spirit that many of us are used to."
5,Awesome sound - excellent CD,I saw Liz at Bogart's in Cincinnati on 11/10/03. I bought her CD before she came to town and then fund out she was. This CD is great...I have played it over and over. And her live performance was really good. I think this CD is her best by far !
3,good...but there are better out there,"This has all the catchiness to make it big on MTV or on the radio, and the songs stick in your head. But if you like this then there are some better bands out there in the underground that may interest you as well.Check out a new band - Manda & the Marbles - they have an album on amazon called ""more seduction"". When Manda & the Marbles came to NYC the Village VOice wrote ""Liz Phair should be taking notes"" which led me to check them out - they were right -Also, check out some older bands like Holly and the Italians, the Primitives or the the Rezillos. All of these should satisfy the subtle void that is left after listening to liz phairs new album."
5,She's back and she is awesome,"Although Liz Phair never really left, I feel her work went slighlty down hill after ""Exile in Guyville"". This new album brings her back with a vengance. She is Carly Simone with an attitude. The music is sassy and the lyrics are clever and her voice is like butter. She even had tears in my eyes. If you loved her first album you will love this one!"
2,This album is disappointing.,"I'm aware that this album is her bid to become a pop star, but that's no excuse for the horrible lyrics. I don't mind the poppy sound of the album. What I do mind are the sentimental, mind numbing, garbage lyrics. The few times she tries to be ""edgy"" it sounds so forced that it makes it even worse. This album sounds more like a Lizzy Maguire soundtrack than a Liz Phair album."
2,There's no 'there' there,"Truth be told, a week ago I wouldn't have known a Liz Phair song if it hit me in the head. I've heard of her but that's about it. But when I heard the 'Extraordinary' tune in a soundtrack I thought it would be a cool artist for my 8 year old daughter to listen to. ooops. I'm no prude but obviously this is not something for a child to listen to.Now that I've heard it and researched her as an artist, I'm compelled to agree with most of the negative reviews if not just a few of the positives. If you don't care any more about what you're listening to than the beat and the guitar riffs you will probably like this album. If you resent pandering and commercialism for product's sake, you might hate this album. it's formulaic, unauthentic, and overt in an Abercrombie&finch; sort of way."
4,solid CD + cool video,"Personally, I like this set of songs for the hook-laden tunes and more-thoughtful-than-the-average-pop-album lyrics, but the relative musical merits have been covered in the other thousand reviews so I'll just mention that I give it an extra star for the cool,unusual video for ""Why Can't I?"" included on the CD."
4,An entertaining book.,"The large purple pill slides easily down the man's throat. Within minutes his skin tingles, his eyes sharpen, and his muscles bulge. This new designer drug gives its users the strength of superman and the brains of Einstein, if only the user doesn't go crazy first.Net Force's job is to find out who is manufacturing this drug and stop him before the drug kills more people.Should the pharmaceutical companies or the military find the person first the results could be disastrous!This is the fifth book in the Tom Clancy created Net Force series. It's a fast paced, action packed novel that's easy to read and will keep you interested from start to finish. While these novels don't have the highly developed characters, and immense detail of Clancy's earlier works they are still very entertaining."
5,"Wow, what a GREAT book","Once again Tom Clancy has outdone himself. This book was the greatest book I've read in my whole life. Tom Clancy's Net Force starts to track a major drug dealer that has created a new drug called, Thor's Hammer. The inventor of this new drug is, Bobby Drayne. Drayne's father is retired from the FBI. This drug is like a steroid, except a lot more potent, it increases all of your senses and makes you really strong. If you want to feel like ""Superman"" for a few hours, it will cost you $40,000. But due to the fact that it is like a steroid, you'd better have a lot of time on your hands to recover from the drug. The Net Force starts going after Drayne, and then there is ""The Point of Impact.""If you like novels that have a lot of action and adventure, this book is for you. It is intriguing and will hold your attention during the whole book. When you think it is about to get boring, more action and adventure comes along. This is a great book! You should buy it!"
1,Not the usual standard expected of Tom Clancy,"Be warned if you do not like bad language you will have a problem with this book. I put up with it until page 299 and decided no more. I found the plot interesting but contrived and certainly no comparison with his previous books. I then took another look at the book cover and realized I had been conned. Tom Clancy didn't even write it. There it was in large letters Tom Clancy, to catch my eye in the bookshop. At the bottom in very small letters, created by Tom Clancy and Steve Pieczenih WRITTEN BY Steve Perry. Need I say more except how very disappointed I feel."
1,Too much day to day stuff,"This book was my least favorite book in the net force series (yes i have read all of them up to springboard)because it has too much useless day to day stuff that is boring. Toni keeps complaining about how shes fat and is on and off with the scrimshaw stuff.Most net force books take me 2 weeks to read...but this one took me a month!Also, what does net force have to do with controlling drugs?The other novels that came after this were pretty much a chore to read, especially state of war. They always just start out with a death (or many),and go through the introduction. Then they just go for days or even weeks without any leads at all. Then a personal event happens, and they get a lead. This is where most of the books start to pick up their pace. This is when its hard to put the book down. But thats changing with every new novel. However when springboard came out in January, it renewed my interest in Net Force."
5,this cd is great,"this cd is in my opinion by far their best work. alot of the songs are upbeat and full of energy and are very catchy. this cd isnt at all repetitive in anyway at all. its a short cd so you cant get bored at all through this cd. all the tracks are mostly straight-forward. Radio hit "" shove it"" is still good after all the years this cd has been out. gotta give it up to the deftones."
5,Good not as great as O-Town,These guys r cool all their cds are good especially this one there are slower tracks like mascara and mx and it is worth the money...but o town is better a lot theyre my fav group oh they so hot and they write such beautiful songs they are better than this band this band and album sucks
2,"One song, thats all.....","The only reason i even bought this cd was for ""my own summer"" it is probably the best song they've ever writen in my state of mind. I personally think that it was unwise of them to put the best song first, seeing that there is no motivation to listen further after its done. I FORCED myself to listen to the whole cd through, because i love deftones and i wanted to give it a fair chance, but nothing caught me really - i personally think that this album drags compared to the others."
3,"Hmm...OK, but ive heard WAY better","this CD is far from REALLY good. they can yell and scream, ut not enough. most the time its just quiet then screaming. its ok but not a MUST buy"
2,Trash,"I still havent listened to this whole cd... because it all sounds the same and the songs arent that great.. My Own Summer is the best song on the cd, and probably the best song they've ever made.. other than that I think the Cd is alright... not worth getting excited over it"
2,"""Be Quiet And Drive"" is my top 5 favourite song","I'm going to make this short!! I bought this album because of ""Be Quiet And Drive"". When I heard this album the other songs didn't quite cut it, THIS song was very well musically composed; It has a whimisically sensual sound that enbarks the odd promiscuous mystery of how music can be organic. I believe a classical orchestra inspiration would've really gave the band more staying power. this is where this band stands in my top 5.#5 Goo Goo Dolls (Only One) #4 Stone Temple Pilots (Plush) #3 DEFTONES (BE QUIET AND DRIVE) #2 Sianspheric (Nothing Stands) #1 Blur (Battle)"
2,"Good CD, but get the first","Chino has an awesome voice, but this CD is lacking something that the first one had. ""My Own Summer"" is the best song, and is on the MATRIX soundtrack, which is a whole lot better than this CD. Like I said, this CD is good, but if you want te real deftones buy the first one"
2,"Good music, but way too familar!","""Shove it"" and ""Rickets"" are good songs, but the rest are nothing special. The one thing that pisses me of, is that this band is such a blatant KoRn ripoff. I swear, the Deftones should just change their name to ""KoRn Lite"", because that's what they are. I had this CD, but traded it for Pantera's ""Great Southern Trendkill"" album. It was a very good exchange."
2,"Dull, boring, uninspiring noise","After purchasing this album, I was very disappointed that my first Deftones CD turned out to be some of the most un-inspiring rock I have heard in a long time. Most of the songs on this album are the same old tired screeching and screaming that could be found elsewhere by such bands as Korn, who I must say do alot better job in tapping into the dark recesses of human angst. Nearly all the songs on this album are really really awful, unintelligeble noise that grows tiring after awhile. I give it 2 stars because the Radiohead-esque track ""Be Quiet And Drive (Far Away)"" is actually a pretty great song, but unfortunately the only good one on this album."
2,Try not to buy this one.,"Most inexperienced listeners will say they like deftones, simply because they've heard the tracks from ""The Crow"" and ""The Matrix"" sound tracks. That's where I used to be: among the many. Now I'm part of the universe that has actually spent money on a real deftones cd. The shove it and fly away songs rock, but the rest just EATS IT. I could seriously make music that's just as good, although I'd have to work on my voice for about 2 seconds. Ha! For those of you who have already bought this cd, do what I did: Ask a friend who hasn't heard very much deftones to ""temporarily"" trade this cd for one of his/hers. Then never give the good cd of their's back! Mwahaha! Just have patience, and your time will come."
2,"I heard chino is getting singing lessons, godspeed!","Along with Tool i think this band is really overated. The distortion is so thick on this album you can barely tell any of the instruments apart. It's like a big wall of fuzz with the occasional snap of a snare drum. Chino Moreno is such an awful vocalist, he can't sing and his screaming is so forced and weak. I'll give it 2 stars since i only give 1 star to truly worthless albums that deserve it, and i guess ""Be Quiet and Drive"" is an enjoyable emo-ish song. I recommed you listen to the bands who influenced the deftones such as Helmet, Bad Brains, Faith no more and Sick of it all."
1,"Be Quiet And Drive (Far, Far Away)","I do not like this band. They are not metal, they are a punk band, and of the hardcore scene, there are a lot better bands than this bunch of Mexican chihuahuas. Helmet helped them get where they are today. Far is probably the most underrated band in history. Hell, even Sick Of It All kicks Chino Moreno's bony behind. Do me a favour, buy Far's ""Tin Cans With Strings To You,"" and stay the hell away from this."
1,Get adrenaline and skip this one.,"I hate the deftones because every album they released after the amazing adrenaline...Pretty much sucked! I remenber enjoying tracks like ""bored"" & ""7 words"" as well as the other great songs that adrenaline had but after that album deftones has been releasing crappy albums such as ""around the fur"" , ""white pony"" and their self title 4th album which sounds horrible and real boring! Don't bother insted buy ""adrenalie"" thats one amazing album..."
5,A Total Gas!,"Never before has a band sounded so cool and laid back, and yet at the same time been totally in your face with a wall of sound that literally knocks you off your feet. The production on ""Around the Fur"" is superior to that of ""Adrenaline"", with the guitars in particular more in your face than before. What amazes me about this album is how beautiful and melodic this sounds despite the aggressiveness and full on aural assault that you are confronted with. The music is built up in textured layers that simultaneously soothe your soul while holding a vice like grip around your throat. I agree with what some of the other reviewers have said here; my initial impressions of the Deftones were of a group in the Korn/Limp Bizkit mould, but upon listening to both their albums in great detail, I have to say they really are in a class all their own.Bring on ""The White Pony""!"
4,Excellent Album But....,"I think this is definitely one of the best Deftones album , and indeed one of the most original rock albums of the last decade. The combination of Chino's vocals and heavily distorted guitar at times seem to reach sublime levels. That said, I had recently purchased this album (for the second time, I lost the first that I had bought on cassette) and found myself tiring of it after listening to it about 2-3 times. What does this mean? Not really anything necessarily,just that the Deftones and specifically Around the Fur , needs to be taken in doses."
4,This album,"If you're contemplating whether or not to buy this album, I sttongly recomend you to buy it. Chino Moreno explodes with powerful vocals that can make someone's head spin. If anyone has listened to Adrenaline and wants to compare it to this one, they will tell you right away thta their song writing has improved dramatically, and musically they've gotten much more mature."
3,"A good, yet still inferior follow-up","This is a good CD, but if yor're looking for true Deftones, get Adrenaline. This is a good buy, don't get me wrong, I just happen to enjoy their 1st CD a lot more. Highlights include ""My Own Summer (Shove It),"" Lhabia,"" Lotion,"" and ""Headup (with Max Cavalera from Soulfly! ) MX is not a bad song either. The bonus track is passable."
2,Where did they go wrong?,"This album is nothing compared to their debut Adrenaline. The only song I thought was o.k. was my very own summer, but you start to get tired of that song. Everything sounds pretty much the same on this cd. I think the Deftones rule but they blew it with this album. Their old songs like Bored are great!!! If you want a good Deftones album check out Adrenaline."
5,Adrenaline Rush,"I wasnt interested in the Deftones until recently I listened to this CD. This is some good hardcore metal music. Not too hardcore, but its metal. I must say im not much of a metal fan except for Rage Against The Machine, Metallica, and old school Incubus. But this CD changed my ways. The best songs on here are My Own Summer (Shove It), Around the Fur, Be Quiet And Drive (Far Away), and MX. I know, not much, but those songs are some of the best metal songs Ive heard."
5,Def Tones kick yet another ass!!!,"The Def Tones fist album Adrenline rocked Seattle and once agin Around the fur confirms that the new wave of rock is here, in bands like the Def Tones, Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Tool. So get ready everyone its going to be a great ride, sit down, shut up, and hold on!"
5,Simply Amazing,"I love this CD. The Deftones are one of the best bands out there and I think it's a shame that they haven't gotten the exposure that they deserve. I would have to say that this is the better of their 2 CD's that they have out so far. Adrenaline is still an awesome album but Around the Fur is a lot heavier and I like Chino's vocals on this album better. Don't get me wrong or anything I mean both Deftones albums are masterpieces, but I just prefer this one over Adrenaline. The best songs are My Own Summer(Shove It), Around The Fur, Rickets, Lotion, and my personal favorite Headup. I would highly recommend that you pick up this CD and Adrenaline as well. I can't wait until White Pony comes out, but until it does I still have Adrenaline and Around the Fur to jam to."
3,It's Okay,"After buying the surprisingly enjoyable White Pony i thought i should check out thier earlier work to see what i've been missing. While there are some flashes of greatness on this album (be quiet and drive, mascara, the title track, mx) i find most of the songs just prod along aimlessly with the same thick wall of screeching guitar fuzz all the way through. Chino's vocals have alot of energy and emotion here but have little range to keep it interesting."
5,deftones sound like korn????????,"whoever reviews this cd and says that deftones sound like korn needs to acctally buy the cd and listen to it first. Chino and Jon have totslly different voicies, and there is a greater emphasise on the guitar playing, not that korn isnt good but korn has never reached the deftones level of musican-ship, only blind can *** with classic songs like shove it, headup, and be quiet and drive, not as good as adrenaline though nothing else is 7 words,bored engine9, hell that whole cd awesome from beginning to end"
3,ProsnCons,"A good album, with some not-so-good songs here n' there. Tracks such as ""lotion"" and ""lhabia"" sound like they're being made up as they go along. However, tunes like ""headup"", ""my own summer"", ""dai the flu"", ""be quiet and drive"", and the title track are all garaunteed to start some dangerous headbangin'."
5,This Is One Of The Best Cd Out There Period......,"Hey i Just Wanted To Say That Deftones Is a Really Good Band Really..I Mean Im a Die Hard Rage Against The Machine Fan But Deftones Bring Something Of Everything To The Gender Heavy Metal.People Say They SOund Like Korn Bull These Guy Are Much More Talented that Korn Lip Or Anything Else OutThere.Im a Big Rage Agains The Machine Fan Olso Pantera.soulfly,system of a Down Those R Pretty Good Bands But Deftones huh They R Gods..My Favorite Tracks Are ...My Own Summer(shove it),lhabia,Mascara be Quiet And Drive(Far Away) And Mx They r Thight Well People Just 3 Words For Yah ""Go Buy It""...Now...Adios"
1,hoh,this is a terrible album! the riffs are bad and the lyrics are bad! there's better albums! try somethin' like led zeppelin!
4,Kitsune Udon On the Go,"Maruchan's Akai Kitsune Udon is a nice treat. Easy to make, but containing a lot of flavor. It's the perfect thing when you're stuck outside Japan, but want Kitsune Udon, or if you are just seeking a great snack to warm you through."
4,Very good flavor,"After living in Japan for three years, it is quite difficult to live without noodles in the US. These hit the spot every time and I look forward to my shipments when they arrive. If you want authentic Japanese Ramen, Yakisoba and Udon, give these a try. You won't be disappointed."
5,My favorite instant noodles,"Fast, Simple & convenient. The udon & the seasoning of the soup is so delicious. My favorite is the age tofu in the soup."
5,Great Book! Lots of Information!,This was an awesome book for our trip to the mountains. It tells you lots of details of what to expect. Great to have!
4,Great Hiking Guide!,"I found this to be a great hiking guide to a place I knew nothing about before arriving. It is very imformative on difficulty of the hikes and what the scenery will be like so you can plan your visit accordingly. I would recommend this book to any level of hikers wanting to leave their car and really see the Great Smokey Mountains from the trail. The guide is so thorough it made it hard to narrow my choices down for the five days of hiking I would be exploring. The only complaint (if you can call it that) would be to include a area map that showed the park in its entirety at the beginning of the book so you can begin to aclimate yourself to where trailheads are located, etc...The book does recommend picking up a map at the visitors center upon arrival, I am just a planner and want to know everything in advance."
4,"Very helpful, but....","This book goes into great detail about the variety of trails in the Smoky Mountains.Pros:-Lists hundreds of trails and breaks them into a variety of categories-Displaces an elevation chart for each trail-Gives historical/ecological information for trailsCons:-Does not have a glossary (trails trails are in order based on the section of the park they are in)-Some key info is not listed until the end of a section on a given trail - so make sure you read the ENTIRE section before choosing a trail. My friend and I recently hiked a trail that was listed as being great and having a fire tower at the top. Too bad we didn't read the second page until 4 miles into a strenuous, bear scat everywhere, 5 miles straight up to find out that they had built an air quality monitoring station on the fire tower and you couldn't go up to see the views!"
5,lots of fun,"Takes a while to figure it out, but my dog loves the sound. She gets excited when I pull out the case, and lies at my feet and drifts off to sleep when I play. Why look for an audience or spend time learning a raga when the Chow Chow is satisfied?"
5,Well written and useful.,"This book offers a good historical overview of the function of the preface within the novel conventions. If you are a fan of Wayne Booth approach to criticism, this work will help you to include some cultural and socio-economic perspective into a structural analysis of the elements of narrative."
5,Very nice game for everyone,"I bought this toy for my daughter for X-mas and she loves it. The characters are cute and is suitable for all ages. The only problem I have is, the game keys are hard to find in stores. Especially the ones for Disney.You have to buy a whole new system with other games."
3,echos of the past,"Gordon Lightfoot's newest album has within it eerie traces of the great work he has done in the past. Yet the album is not great--good yes, but not great. As it does with so many of us, age is catching up with the master troubadore. The title song has echos of a great number of his hits. It will be one of the cuts on this album which will last. Probably the best song is ""ringneck loon"" which combines Lightfoot's best minstralcy with his off-beat humor. To those of us who have loved his work over decades, this will be a pleasant listen and a gentle reminder of what once was."
2,Better than no album at all!,"This new album is better than no album at all. Gordon has entertained us for decades. He has the right to just kick back and do nothing at all. At least he is giving his fans something new. Several new songs such as ""A Painter Passing Through"" and ""Drifters"" are as good as any classic Lightfoot song. Many other songs are weak, but that has often been the case on many of his albums. I am tired of some of these reviewers coming down on Gordon for having done nothing good since the 1960s and early 70s. Though the many of the songs from the 60s are great the production values really stink. To these people I say that Gordon reached his peak in the quality of songs and production with the 1980s albums ""Shadows"" & ""Salute."" Hopefully we will have Gordon around for many more years."
5,Another beautiful piece of art,"I adore this album. My favorites are 'My Little Love' (great beat), 'Drifters', and 'Painter Passing Through'. I did not care for 'Ringneck Loon' AT FIRST! Now it is beginning to be one of my favorites. This is not an album of radio hits. It is another collection of thoughts and memories of one of the greatest songwriters of all time. His aging voice is just 'seasoning' that makes me love his newer music even more. I am so thankful that I 'bumped' into this 'Painter' 35 years ago. His music touches me in a way that no other music could. Keep the records coming Gordon. I am holding my breath waiting for more."
2,"A great singer, a not-so-great album","I was dismayed by the harsh nasality of Gordon Lightfoot's once-resonant voice on his latest CD, A Painter Passing Through. I took this to mean that age had finally caught up with him, and, with much trepidation, went to see him in concert. Something is wrong! He is NOT so nasal, nor aged, and, most definitely, NOT at ALL like this album.Although A Painter Passing Through DOES highlight Gordon's delightful songwriting skills, its production leaves MUCH to be desired. Gone are the melodic undertones of Don Quixote and Sundown...they are replaced by an almost frightening nasality, a straining, grating noise that is especially apparent on ""Ringneck Loon"", one of the most lyrically wonderful tracks on the CD. For the true-of-heart, buy this album, if only for the lyrics, but be certain that you see him live, if only to hear the songs as they are MEANT to sound."
3,A positive reflection from an old friend...,"I've been a fan of Gordon Lightfoot since the late sixties/early seventies, and have collected every album he has recorded. The tracks on this CD continue the tradition of varied style and mood that has made Gordon so distinct as an artist. ""Is he country? Or is he rock?"" Is he consistant? YES! ""Anything new?"" Perhaps not for the top 40, but all fans will treasure the continued relationship between themselves and Gordon Lightfoot that ""A Painter Passing Through"" provides. The quality of this work is also a tribute to the tightness of his band, whose members remain as much a part of his music as Gordon himself. As age brings different perspectives, the voice continues to tell about life's experiences. I will always want to hear new stories...from an old friend!"
1,Oh Well...,"I hate Gordon Lightfoot, I love my husband. I am buying this CD for him! he is Gordon Lightfoot's #1 fan!!"
2,Lightfoot's Golden Voice-gone...,"What a sad thing... my beloved Lightfoot music reduced to a shadow of it's former self... Still, ""Ringneck Loon"" and ""Much to My Surprise"" have the a hint though, of the old Lightfoot... 25 years ago his voice was INCOMPARABLE... very sad, but I still listen to all my earlier Lightfoot albums in my car's 12 CD player... 9 of them are Gord's!! Lightfoot has been my favorite since I was 16 (28 years ago) Well wishes to all Lightfoot fans..."
2,Two out of 10,"That's how many good tracks are on this cd. Most of the songs GL has written are too high for his voice. When he sings Ian Tyson or Steve McEown, he sings in his good old baritone and with a vitality that isn't in the other cuts. These two cuts (Red Velvet and I Used to Be a Country Singer) are awfully good, though.He seems to have some itch to write a song about the loon, he's tried it before, but it doesn't quite make it. The age of Froggy Went A-courtin' is long gone. And Uncle Toad won't revive it."
2,"Gord's Not ""Gold,"" He's Just Old","Even hard-core Lightfoot fans will have a difficult time finding anything wonderful about this newest CD. There is none of the rich nuances of earlier Lightfoot recordings such as the ""Sundown"" or ""Summertime Dream"" albums. While some artists's voices mellow and grow richer with age, Lightfoot has only a nasal whine that grows wearisome after a few songs. As a long-time Lightfoot fan, I can only recommend that others stay with the early stuff and end their Lightfoot collection with ""East of Midnight."" There's nothing new after that."
4,"If you got it, you got it.","I have to agree with previous reviews that Lightfoot has lost the richness of his voice, especially the lower register. However, this CD is growing on me. I like it much better than ""Waiting for You"". My favorite song is ""Ring-necked Loon"" Hey, I can't help it! This album still has some of the musical magic from earlier days, and, as always is full of those great Lightfoot lyrics--so real and true to life, yet so magical and adventurous."
2,Vocal style is all wrong,"I don't know if it is age or perhaps maybe Gordon has asthma, I don't know. But the nasal sound that has replaced one of the greatest voices is very disturbing. I bought this CD when it came out and I no longer have it. I also did not have internet access at that time or I would have listened to some samples.I guess I expect Gordo to sound like he did 20-25 years ago. Everyone changes for different reasons and I will always love his 70's & 80's music but this one is not for me. Do yourself a favor and listen to the samples before buying and judge for yourself. I will be looking forward to the next CD from Gordo but I'll test drive before I buy.The intrumentation is fine by the way, it's just the voice that gets me."
5,A truly satisfying CD!!!,"I've been a fan of Gordon's for as long as I can remember, andwas understandably pleased to be able to buy a copy of this CD for my collection! Among the songs I particularly liked were the title track, and ''Uncle Toad Said''is also whimsical and entertaining. The only one I had a hard time getting into was''Ringneck Loon''--simply stated, I just didn't care for it as much as the others! I don't think anyone who is adding Gordon's music to their CD collection should miss this!"
2,I was shocked;what is his record company thinking???,"When I first played this, I thought there was something wrong with the CD. His voice is totally shot. The lyrics of the songs are beautiful, but he should find someone else to sing them. I'm in mourning."
4,"Play it again, Sam; it grows on you.","A friend of mine put this CD on and asked me to identify the singer. I couldn't. And of the three concerts I've attended in my life, two of them were Gordon Lightfoot. She later gave me this album and bought another for herself. I play it often and my appreciation for it continues to grow. Much to my surprise."
2,Too old to rock and roll & too old to sing!!!!,"I'm a huge Gordo fan and this album was a major disappointment. Whoever said his voice was shot was really being generous. The years of booze and cigarettes haven't been kind. Even the digital masters couldn't fix this album. The upside is good guitar work and the background band is typically fine. Please Gordon, let us remember you as you were. No mas!!!"
2,Gordon Lightfoot meets Donald Duck,"As a big fan of Gordon Lightfoot over the years, it is a shame to see how much he is repeating himself. If you have any one of his original post-1980 releases, you pretty much have them all. The most disturbing aspect of ""A Painter Passing Through"" is how nasal his voice has become--almost as if he took a drag of helium before stepping to the microphone each time."
1,Still a Story Teller,"I've been Gord's fan for his career on records and in concert for 28 years, and I truly hate to see this kind of decline in his work. Some performers go through a kind of transformation, voice mellowing, getting stronger. Lightfoot seems somehow weaker and unmoved. Instead of being transported by the music (last remembered example, This Here Tattoo) he seems to play heartlessly, merely wanting to get it over with. Gord does retain his ability to tell a good story though (q.v. Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald, Ballad of the Yarmouth Castle),in I Used to be a Country Singer, a song about a sad motel maid who used to ""sing a mean Patsy Cline."" This cut and My Little Love are about the only keepers. Sadly, this album is a little too much like its immediate predecessor, Waiting for You, which was a total dud. Sorry Gord, if you keep up at this rate ""a painter passing through"" will merely be asked to just keep on going."
3,Boys bike,Not quite as easy to assemble as we hoped! Still having issues getting the training wheels to function safely.
3,Annibale Bugnini: The unfavored Son,"More is to be had in this book's footnotes than in the text itself. There Bugnini is most forthright, apparently without ever being able to come to truthful conclusions, about his prideful, scheming plans to detach the liturgy renewal from the natural,historic liturgical progression that has always be in motion.Was Pope Paul VI pleased with Bugnini's work? Events say no. Pope Paul exiled Bugnini to Iran while he was aged and ill, very much against Bugnini's will."
3,Mediocre,"The overall design is not bad. but its not a great fit. the case is a bit tight for the phone, made it seem like the phone won't fit 100% into the case. I feel that the phone could stretch the case that could it break. The belt clip makes it stick out more (out away from the body)when its attach to my waist so its gives it room to move around and buttons could be hit. Texture of the case its not bad, I thought it would be better then a leather one so I got this one."
4,Good Cell Phone Case for the buck,This cell phone case is very snug to the phone although it fits perfectly. Don't let some of the other reviews throw you off it doesn't have any problems with the size or getting the camera lense open on your phone like it says in past reviews. Overall it is a good value for what you pay and the seller is quite fast and accurate in shipping the product. Overall would highly recommend you try this case for your phone. It will last you a very long time and you can't beat the price. Better than the ones verzion sells for this phone.
4,Rubber Case,"This is a great cover because it protects the phone completely. The only downfall is that it covers the keyboard and makes it very difficult to type. I made a lot of typing mistakes using this cover, but it protected everything on the phone."
1,Insanity...,"i have never purchased something that worked this poorly. every time it needed to be played, it had to have the battery replaced, even if it was within an hour. i called the technician and all he said was to format it. this would be easy if it didn't shut off constantly. i found it impossible. this had to be stated because either mine is defective, or it may be really the way an iclick operates. i know i'm returning it."
1,Problems from the start,"I was really excited after reading the previous reviews on this product. However, when I received my iClick it would not power up. I returned it approximately two weeks ago to iClick & have not heard what the problem was. So I have not yet had a chance to use my iClick. So I wait and wait and wait. No response from any of my e-mails requesting a report."
3,Good and Bad,"I bought two of these players for my sons, and they worked very well for a few days. One of them stopped working, wouldn't turn on, and I had to send it back. Amazon was great, and sent a replacement immediately. Shortly after, the second one stopped working, and then within one week the replacement player stopped working. This product is very defective."
4,So far.....,"So far i got this mp3 player and it is very good.The 128mb hold over 4 hours of songs.It was hard at the begining to put the songs in but, i did it and i like."
4,Let Boney set the Mood!,This album begins to set the mood with it's cd cover and booklet with it's simple pictures of sliced fruit that are so real in appearance that you can taste their sweet juices. Followed up by a 10 truely great jazz songs that are just as sweet. These songs are able to convey energy and motion while somehow still able to sooth the listener.Having seen Mr. James in concert and having heard him describe the origins and objectives behind some of this albums songs I think it would be fair to say that given the response of the other reviewers that he succeeded. While jazz can have many goals such as relaxing the listener or providing music to dance to this albums goal was to create an atmosphere for romance and romance alone. There are no drastic changes in tempo or arrangement that will break the mood.So if you want to create that special mood or reflect on previous romantic moments this album will help you get going.
3,You may want to reconsider...,"This is definitely NOT Boney James' best album, but one that deserves some recognition nonetheless. The album is very slow, and sounds like modern R&B throughout. He does a fine job with his suprano saxophone, but overdoes it on some tracks and begins to sound a lot like Kenny G. I must credit the bass lines on this album, it's good to hear a jazz bassist that actually plays a low B or C [five or six string bass] more often than once per song. I use Sweet Thing as background music when I have people over, but not for an intense jazz experience. I suggest picking up Boney James' ""Seduction"" if you want to hear his true talent."
5,"Sexy, seductive","Boney's first Sweet Thing is James' best total CD enjoyment focused on the spirit of love; smooth, relaxing and seductive; however, the latest cut with the mix can not measure up; too bad; looking for the original"
5,Smooth Jazz at its best.........,"Boney James is the reigning ""King of Smooth Jazz"". He was influenced by one the greatest jazz musicians of all time in Grover Washington Jr. So there should be no surprise why this LP is a precious jewel to own. Modern day jazz classics like ""East Bay"", ""Words"" (Unspoken), ""I Still Dream"", ""It's All Good"" and the title track go beyond smooth while cuts like ""Innocence"" and ""After The Rain"" blend in but standout at the same time. This album is a Smooth Jazz classic and is great for a listener just getting into the genre of Jazz. There is also a R&B flavored version of ""It's All Good"" featuring Eric Benet. It will easy for R&B soul lovers to enjoy this record."
3,Sharp Knives...Cheap Handle,"The knives are definitely sharp, but the handles make the knives look cheap. I would also have to agree that the paring knife is very light. All of my knives are Wusthof and this set is not the quality that I would have expected from Wusthof, even at the lowest level pricing."
4,I love this!,"This is the only fragrance I have found that truly smells ""tropical"". This is my boyfriends favorite scent, and he thinks all perfumes ""stink"". The four stars is because it takes this spray awhile to go from greasy and oily to dry. You have to wait awhile before you get dressed. But it smells great!"
5,Beautiful fragrance!,"Found this in a store in San Diego. Loved it, didn't buy it then. I wish I had because a month later I ended up ordering it online. I live in Vancouver. I guess I had ""browsers remorse"". Beautiful."
4,Holds your attention!,"Good book with a litle touch of everything! Appeals to your mystery side. Again, the cats come through. A true cat lover's book."
3,"My First ""Cat Who"" Book","And I think it shouldn't have been my first. The book has the feel of the latest in a looong series-- one that's really going to appeal to people already attached to the characters.The crusty local newspaperman Qwilleran (and naturally his two Siamese cats) is called to investigate ghosts when his ex-housekeeper is literally frightened to death. Is the supernatural involved, or is the haunting of a more earthly origin?"
5,The Cat Who Talked to Ghosts,"Qwilleran is sitting at home when he gets a call from one of his old friends. It's Mrs. Cobb and she sound really afraid. After asking many times, she says that she thinks there is a ghost in her house. Qwill decides to go and calm her down, but when he arrives, she is dead. After he and his mystery-solving cats move into her old house to try to figure out who or what killed Mrs. Cobb, strange things happen. He discovers many things about her odd house that he would never have guessed.Lilian Jackson Braun knows just how to keep a reader hooked. I didn't want to put the book down until I figured out who or what the killer was. I highly recommend The Cat Who Talked to Ghosts to teenagers and young adult readers who love a good mystery."
3,"Good, but slow",The Cat Who Talked to Ghosts. The title catched by eye. The was very good and was about Jim and his two detective cats who have to solve a murder mystery! At points this book was quite boring but usually always picked itself up later.
4,So Sad....,"In the latest edition with Qwill and the gang of cats we see a major character killed off which is so sad cos she was one of the nices ones.Once discovered that Qwills old friend has been ""scared to death"" he moves in to the farm house, which doubles as a museum, and begins to sniff out possible explanations for his dear friends death. Again this leads to Ko Ko trying to state the facts from his point of view what is going on, even going as far as talking to ghost....or so it seems. And naturally what insues is fun new characters, more murders, and even more mayhem all leading to the killer in the end.If your looking for a really easy read this is definitly for you as long as you are a fan of the series because the murder mystery definitly takes back seat to the other story lines and new and familiar characters that pop up. If your new to the series I would recommend starting at the beginning to see how it all began. A must read for any Cat Who fan...."
3,The Cat Who Talked to Ghosts,"Two of the good parts were the death of Iris Cobbsand also the actual investigating by QwillOne part I did not like was there were too many ""misleading stories"""
2,"good item, did not last.",Excited when I received the produce. Did not use long and within one year one pitch was blocked out. It is expensive and now sitting in my closet.
3,School Law Average,"School Law & the Public Schools is at best an introduction to school laws. It is fine for undergrads, but for Master's programs it is lacking any real detail or substance. If you like the basics this one fills the bill. If you need in-depth knowledge go elsewhere."
5,School and the law,This is a great book for information about school and the laws that govern them. I recommend this book.
2,"Ok, not what I was looking for",This book was not as detailed as I had hoped. It was not as specific as I wanted. Other than that it was ok.
2,Nearly New?!?!,"This textbook was a required text for a grad. class. I understand that a textbook should be ""nearly new"" after being used by an owner, however, this textbook's spine was spliting in half and every chapter was heavily highlighted. I would have thought I would have paid half the price, but not quite!"
5,"A ""Make Sense"" Guide For All Educators","The author wrote this book in such a manner that a high school government student could understand the majority of the legal discussion and implications for school leaders.Today's educator would be remiss not to read this down to earth text and not pay attention to its contents while working in today's educational environments where one is constantly exposed to being sued.The author provides the reader with clear and understandable legal definitions, administrative summaries, landmark cases, and interesting legal situations that have occurred in public schools across the United States.Classroom teachers, school principals, superintendents, school board members, and graduate students all come away with a sense of ""I will not do that again"" after reading this very practical school law guide.While the book does not address school integration and school finance issues from a legal stance, it does an excellent job of addressing all other aspects of educational law."
3,wish there was a kindle edition,"As others have said, a good, simple overview. Case studies and questions were good, but since all of the cases are readily available online, the majority of these could be eliminated and just referenced. The price tag is hefty, and in this day in age, I would definately prefer an electronic version"
3,Page numbers - kindle edition,I was excited to purchase this book for grad school and read it through the Kindle app in my iPad. It would be nice to have page numbers that correspond with the actual text somewhere to speed class discussion and help with citations in essays.
1,Kindle version is terrible,"The text itself is great, but the Kindle version has no page numbers! Very difficult to navigate. This is very frustrating."
2,Not so good,"Not as good as I had heard or read other reviews say it was. Not really a military sci-fi story, it just has people in the military. The main guy, Tetsuo, is not human. You can tell by the ending. His relationship with his family is non-existent, all under the cover of trying to be a good soldier. I get the whole we-fight-to-feed-our-family story, but it was not interesting. No big fights or battles between squads or platoon. No dropships. No armor. No military esprit-de-corps. No camaraderie between people. I know it's an old book, but don't bother. Just re-read Starship Troopers, Armor, Forever War, Halo: The Fall Of Reach, any William Dietz or David Drake book, To Hell And Back, or The Greatest Generation."
5,"Haydn: The King is dead, long live the Emperor","This is a great CD, the Kodaly quartet was passionate and moving, especially in the 2nd movement of the Emperor. The recording is dated, 1988, and it shows, from the placement of the microphones, but the sound is tremendous.The price was a steal!"
2,Double scream. 16th arpil 2004.,"Seen the first, 2nd would probably be just as boring. They are rated 2 to 3 stars that isn't much and really i didn't find this briliant so the 2nd would get boring too. It is a little bit like scream, but scream is much better. Because the set is stupid on this like at the begginning, she sees the murderer and he sits laughing and it looks a little bit silly. Scream is more serious than this it is more freaky for people and scream is way better."
2,Two and a half stars,"The idea of Scary Movie seemed great,but the results aren't so great.Entertaining to say the least,up the story line follows Scream to closely for most of the movie.Some of the humor is funny,but I don't really care to see women with male body parts or male parts in someones ear."
3,real funny movie!,"i liked this movie alot, but there were some things that were boring and sexual. If you want a funny movie this is it, but be ready for some R scenes. WARNING: dont let this movie fall into a 10 or unders hands, it might be too much. there were some bare laughs but its a (dirty) movie sorta. This movie is not scary!"
4,"sick, disgusting, perverted, horrible, and funny","I am a 20 year old male with a sick and demented sense of humor, and I found this movie(obviously) to be very funny. a spoof of ""Scream"" and ""I know..."", and many others, scary movie is a good movie to laugh at. while not a film I would want to buy and watch 80 times, it was a good laugh. In all seriousness: DO NOT let children watch this movie! It will warp their fragile little minds. in my humble opinion, at least rent the film. it is good for some laughs."
2,The wrong rating!,"This was a poorly made movie. Yes is had comedic moments, but the unnecessary sexual implications were overbearing! I don't ever want my kids to see this movie. Hey Hollywood wake up and don't waste your money!!"
4,Mixed emotions!,"Before I start ranting about how funny this movie is, I have to get this off of my chest - Scary Movie is one of the worst movies ever! By far and away, this is complete trash. It is just that as another member of society, trash like this is not only acceptable, it is extremely entertaining. There, I said it! Scary Movie is awful as a movie, but you will be laughing like a trippin' hyena while you watch this.Do make sure you know a few quick facts before you buy this though: it is gross, I have never seen a movie before where a guy literally gets stabbed by another guy's wang. Not only that but the constant use of extremely sickening sex jokes and the frequent male nudity almost drove me to insanity the first time I watched this flick. If you can get over this, you will find that this is one of the funniest flicks in years, much like I did. I just hope that all comedies do not turn into this."
3,A fun movie to only see once,"This movie makes you laugh histarically, but it's jokes are somewhat repititious and if you see this movie more than 3-4 times, you get bored."
1,brain dead,"tedious, regurgitating half digested bits of existing horror movies, this is strictly for morons"
2,not THE most disturbing movie......,"...but then again, THE most disturbing movie was religous. Scary Movie is filled with sex, and masked murderers that must of been drunk. It has the crudest humor I've ever seen. it pokes fun at baywatch , the six sense, scream, i know what you did last summer, and many, many , others. it has alot of nudity, cursing , and stereotipical acts. it also has some funny stuff, and alot of potty humor.the only thing that is even near funny is the part where prince is tied up.the only reason i gave it two stars is because i probably couldn't make a better movie."
4,REALLY FUNNY!,"This film was real funny, but some parts I really didn't get. That is why I just missed giving it 5 stars.But, for what it was, it was veeeeeerrrry funny. It had really good jokes about hits like 'Scream', 'I Know what You did Last Summer' and more! This is what you should rent if your over 16, if you really want a good comedy! BUY THIS!"
2,funny moments don't override bad taste,"grudgingly i have to admit this movie had some moments i thought were funny, and the humor wasn't too forced. unfortunately most all the humor was all based on vulgarities, although some was simply ridiculous, which came off a little better since it was not as overused of a tactic for providing laughs. the Wayans are more than a little hung up on homosexuality as a big joke here; seems like someone is very uncomfortable with their own sexuality."
1,The worst movie Iv'e ever seen!,"The actors,(characters)in this movie are terrible.They have absolutely no talent at all!This movie is total teenage garbage.It's almost like MTV made this terrible movie!The jokes aren't funny at all(they are stupid), and it wasn't well done at all! If you like to pretend that dumb MTV movies(garbage) are funny then you'll love this movie(or at least pretend)in front of your friends. If you are smart then you will realize that this is a terrible film that's not funny at all."
1,Gross and not too funny,"The Wayans need to take a lesson from the Farrellys the next time they do a gross-out movie. The difference is the Farrellys never tend to stereotype people and they know how to do a really good gross out comedy while being in good taste. The Wayans, on the other hand, force people to laugh at people being brutally murdered and X-rated sex jokes. (In my opinion, ""Scary Movie"" should be X-rated.)One good thing though: It makes fun of the Budwiser commercials.(Hint: WASSSSSSSSSSSSUPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP)(...)"
4,"Funny Movie of the ""Airplane"" Genre","I thought this was a funny movie. No, it was not a masterpiece... and yet, I was entertained consistently through the whole thing. If you like to laugh and you are not weird about what you think is offensive (frankly--I didn't think there was anything offensive about it at all), get this movie and get a bowl of popcorn and get ready for some good sight gags, some witty take-offs of other type movies, and some amazingly good acting. Come to think of it, the acting kind of bumped this movie up a level in my opinion. The players were all good. They had fun, too--you could tell.best, jean"
3,FUNNY AND FILTHY...,"""Scary Movie"" parodies a number of teen scare flicks and other horror or suspense movies. A viewer who has seen movies such as ""Scream"", ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", ""The Sixth Sense"", and ""The Blair Witch Project"" will better understand some of the jokes and sight gags around which the thin story line revolves.This movie is not for anyone with delicate sensibilities, as everything, including erect male sex organs, pubic hair, flatulence, and other usually taboo subjects, are ripe for gags, most of which, while filthy, are often funny. If you do not like your jokes down and dirty, then this movie is definitely not for you."
4,Scary of a Time!,"The plot is the plot from any Scream Movie,when a killer calls women and then kills them.I saw this movie on Pay-Pre-View along with Scream 3 and Coyote Ugly.It was an cool movie but the only thing was it was not like Screams were!Casey from the opening of Scream 1 did not have a tit made out of ice but still...It's Kewl!"
1,I'd give it ZERO stars if I could.....,"Scary Movie is one of those dreadfully unfunny comedies that just had so much potential but fell short. I mean what genre is easier or more fun to parody than the horror genre? If there had been more witty observations on scary movies than juvenile humor it might have been good. Personally I blame the Wayans, because the third wasn't as juvenile, and was you know actually funny..."
1,Dumbest movie of the year,"I saw this movie because the commercials looked funny, but the movie itself was nothing, but gross humor. Many spoof movies are funny, but this one is not definately not one of them."
2,Truly GROSS,"I am not easily offended by movies. I was not offended by American Pie, Something About Mary or even Porky's though it has been a long time since I've seen Porky's. Only see this if you can't find anything better. There is really a stupid, gross male gonads joke that seems to go on forever but is probably less than a minute. It must be a male humor joke but the males in the audience didn't seem to find it funny either, probably in there for shock value. The movie is truly funny from beginning to end as juvenile comedies should be (hence 2 stars), but you would definately want to view this before letting anyone under 17 view it or sensitive people over 17"
1,not very good,This movie should of been rated NC-17. Because of all the sex in it. There was only a few funny parts in this movie.
5,Off Tha RiCKtor!,"If Use A 4:20 Type Of Person, This Movie Is A Must Get. Fasho, This Film Is Off Tha RiCKtor. Them Wayans Bros Has Done It Again. Imma Keep This Short Because I Dont Have The Ability To Write A Whole Book Like Some Of The Other Reviewers. I Recommened This Movie If U's A Pot Head And Want A Good Laugh, U Wont Be Dissappointed. One Mo Gin Fa Tha BloCK."
1,After seeing part 3...don't get inspired to buy part 1,"The first Scary Movie is just 120 minutes of dumb jokes. Some of which are waaaay too offensive for younger viewers.The second movie is a lot different. Its actually funny! I recomend buying part 2, and go to see part 3 next month in theaters."
5,THIS IS ONE FUNNY MOVIE...........,THIS WAS ONE CRAZY. I WATCH THIS MOVIE ALL THE TIME. ITS SO FUNNY AND THE THING BOUT IT IS THAT U CANT NEVER GET ENOUGH OF IT. IF U LIKE COMEDY THEN I THINK U WOULD LIKE THIS MOVIE. I LIKE EVERY MOVIE THAT MARLON WAYANS MAKE. U JUST CANT GET ENOUGH OF THIS MOVIES. SO LIKE I SAID IF U LIKE COMEDY'S THEN U WILL LIKE THIS MOVIE.
1,Watch out for the DVD Version,"The movie is totally great... I would buy it... if it would work! Scary Movie has a defect in it that doens't let it play on some DVD players. I know JVC, Hitachi, and other DVD players are not able to play this movie... So do some research and call your DVD player company and see if they are having problems with Scary movie as well. Hopefully the manufacturers of Scary Movie do a recall as many places have removed the DVD from the shelves because of the high return rate."
4,"Not just scary, there's hilarious, and crude, and . . .","Scary Movie turned out what I thought it to be (a halirious movie with people getting killed off in wacky ways and silly parodies of recent horror movies) and what I didn't think it to be (showing ...ahem... small full frontal male nudity, and a major major gross scene). The Wayans have majorly beat the ""There's Something About Mary"" creators with the most gross-out jokes ever displayed in a movie. Anyway, Scary Movie was a good funny movie. The acting, for a parody, was great. And even though it followed Scream by every scene almost, there were other movies parodied and mentioned. For example: I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Matrix, American Pie, The Blair Witch Project, Amistad, Shakespeare in Love, Friday the 13th, and I even caught something that dealt with The Exorcist. And how they copied Tatum's death scene was hilarious. If I say anymore, I will give out what plot here is to the movie, so I'm going to stop. Go check it out!"
3,"Not the best genre spoof, but worth a chuckle or two","Every genre has it's spoof so it should come as no surpirse that 'Scary Movie' was made. If not for the writing talents of the Wayan's Brothers it could have been much worse, but at least it manages to be entertaining. The DVD offers some nice behind the scenes footage and deleted scenes which make purchasing the film worthwile. All in all, it's worth purchasing (if you have a coupon)."
4,Chill Out and Watch!,"OK, this is probably one of the most vulgar movies out. It even beats the apple pie scene in American Pie. But, come on, you have to admit you can't help but laugh. It was funny. I really feel this should have been an NC-17 rated movie from the get go, but I'm not in charge of that department. Don't let your kids watch it, but take a chance, rent it and let your inhibitions fly out the window. I'm not sure if this is one I'll add to my collection. But if I do, it'll have a nice place next to my copy of American Pie.BTW, my favorite scene was probably the most disgusting, so I can't describe it. But I'll never look at chainsaws the same way again."
4,Horror movie spoof!,"Saw the movie in the theater, 2nd time around. Laughed until I cried. A must see, only if you have seen 'Scream' and 'I know what you did last summer'. Most of the scenes are spoofs of the original movies. Anyone not seen those movies may not understand the real humor of this movie. However, I dropped one star because it was a lot cruder than it needed to be.I will definately buy this DVD when it releases, but keep the kids away!"
4,"Very Funny, But Not Suited For Children","This movie isn't really a scary movie, but it is a spoof of mainly I know what you did last summer, and scream, it's hillarious, but it has blood, violence and nudity of male genetailia(ok i miss spelled that), not suited for anyone one under 17"
4,Scary Movie on DVD - Cheap and Funny!,"Okay, it's corny with bad acting bordering on ridiculous, but it's funny! It's raunchy with some crude lines and touches on the offensive. If this hasn't turned you off to the movie, I think you'll actually like it like I do. Just put aside all your inhibitions and enjoy this true parody of slasher movies of the 90's era.I've watched this movie many times and decided to buy it (used). Watching it now again on DVD I am better able to catch some scenes and background funnies I missed before. Also, the DVD has a few cool deleted scenes and movie details I found interesting.Anyway, for a few dollars, I am happy to have this movie in my collection."
2,"Should be entitled ""Stupid Movie!""","One would know the plot of Scary Movie if he/she has seen Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, but this is not why I consider the movie ridiculous.The movie starts out funny in the beginning, but as one gets to the middle, it gets stupider by the minute. To add another comment, the end of the movie made absolutely no sense.After finishing my viewing of the movie, I checked out some deleted scenes, which were also stupid except for one. The one deleted scene that even came close to funny involved sex...between Wayans' character and a female. One would have to view the scene to know why it's the funniest one.In conclusion, despite the few funny scenes in the movie, it is not worth buying. A lot of money would be saved just renting it if one even bothers to view it at all."
2,what's the big deal?,"THE PLOT: There wasn't much of one... It's basically about these teens who accidentally kill this guy, and 2 of them go insane from it. And then, a charecter that we don't know who (I won't ruin it, but it makes no sense), starts killing people off for no apparent reason. Then, he gets away. The end.MY OPINION: The movie was WAY overrated. Scary Movie 3 was hilarious, because it had different screenwriters. This movie was pretty much just disgusting throughout the entire thing. Skip it and move on to 3, please.SPECIAL FEATURES: The spcieal features were almost aas bad as the movie itself (I won't go that far, because that would just be MEAN).OVERALL RATING: D."
1,"Should have been called ""stupid movie""","I like movies that spoof others as much as the next girl... or even just dumb humor.. Otherwise i wouldn't have watched SNL for so many years and Airplane, Fletch, Naked Gun, There's something about Mary..But, this movie was not funny except for maybe the quick cameo and the guy who was gay and trying (sort of) to act like he wasn't..Everything else.. the excessive farting stuff the bats in the underwear, blah blah blah.. bored me.. I started cleaning my room halfway through. Not for me."
1,Oh brother,How could the makers of this film get away with this trash? The humor is sophomoric and at times disgusting. The film makers rely on terrible gross out gags for laughs with terrible results. I can not stand this film. Nobody should be forced to sit through this landfill.
3,A TRULY FUNNY MOVIE,"This movie was entertaining. It spoofed on all of the scary movies of the past 5 years and it did a great job. It wasn't a stupid comedy like we are used to. Carmen Electra was beautiful like usual, even though her character was short-lived. The Wayans perfectly fit the characters. There were so many parts that I was amazed they kept in the movie, I am glad somebody didn't try to cut them out. Too much censorship now-a-days. The movie is not a mind challeging experience, but one you can just sit back and enjoy. It runs less than two hours, which is nice. If you are a fan of comedies, aren't looking for a serious movie and aren't easily offended, you will enjoy this film."
1,it's awful..,"i watched the trailer,and i was realy looking forward to see this movie.It seemed the most funny movie,i laughed a lot.Then i went to watch the movie.I was never embarassed in my whole life!!the whole flick is about male genitalia,some scenes it was even disgusting..And it wasn't funny at all.If you have some brain and moral avoid it at all costs! zero stars"
1,The only movie not worth watching,This is the worst movie on the face of the planet. I couldn't even stand to look at it. I had to go home and take a cold shower after. Just don't waste your money on this garbage.
1,Pure Garbage,"15 minutes was all I was able to watch before I stopped it. I've seen bad comedy, but this movie is extremely tasteless. Most of the ""Humor"", if you choose to use that word, is focused on sexual content and cheap vulgarity. I wouldn't recommend that movie for anybody I care about."
3,NOT A FAMILY MOVIE... OK?,"Oh my God... definately do not see this movie with your parents, ok? ... This is definately a teen movie! I can only imagine what it would of been like if my parents were in the theater with me lol.. My mom would of said ""They showed WHAT? "" lol.. Scary Movie is an un-original movie.. spoofing many horror movies! But it's of coarse ment to be un-orginal.. And that is definately the funny thing about it.. I always am the girl who gets scared in all those horror movies.. but this one of coarse didn't scare me (i was proud lol).. This movie is what some teens think about after watching a corny horror movie.. Like ""what if?"" or ""wouldn't it be funny if.."" because you have to admit.. a lot of teen horror movies can be very corny! This is a movie you got to see with your friends.. and you'll want to see it again.. and talk about it.. So go with your friends, NOT YOUR FAMILY"
2,scary movie,this movie has got terrible reports and reviews . it isnt funny it could have been better but its not the worst. its about a killer trying to kill people . it kind of has the same story line of scream but it tries to make fun of it in the making .
1,Bad Imitation,It is in my opinion that this movie was horrible. The purpose of it was to make fun of other horror films but they did not do a good job. In fact it was stupid. Who wants to waist 8 dollars on a movie ticket to see people act like characters they have already seen-- no-one. This movie can be summed up in about two words-- a joke! I give this film 1 star because that is the most it deserves.
1,Sick sick sick,"This is the dumbest movie I have ever seen. It is Sick, Sick, Sick,. It makes scream I Know what you Did Last Summer look stupid stupid stupid stupid . The efects are crap crapy crapy. The must vile movie series ever made.Am buddy who watches this series, is weird, dumb, or a fool. Don't watch this six movie ug or its sequels. This movie sucks sucks sucks sucks sucks. For the love of horrror it sucks. I hope the people who directed it go bankrupt.I rather watch dumb Chukey and day thant this."
1,Thoroughly Disgusting,"What a waste. A potentially hillarious idea turned into such a waste of film, and now, DVDs. The flick has its moments, like the ""Whassup"" Scream guy scene, and a couple of others. The trailer for this movie had everybody laughing hard, but when I saw the movie, I discovered that the parts in the trailer were the only parts of the movie that were funny. Everything else had to do with the male organ, sex, or homosexuality, all crudely portrayed. If you have decent taste and you have seen the comercials, there is no reason for you to buy this trash."
4,Scary Movie,"Very funny spoof of the movies ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer."" The dvd includes lots of hilarious scenes that were edited out of the movie. (Those scenes are definately R rated but very funny.)"
2,Tried way too hard...,"Ok, guys, here's the deal. If you're really into horror movies (as opposed to thrashing them, like me), have religiously watched every major horror movie in the 90's, and don't wanna take yourself so seriously, then this certainly is for you. I'm sure that, an avid fan of ""Scream"" or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" with a really filthy mouth and raunchy sense of humor would enjoy this flick. Personally, I found it too...coerced. The funny scenes in the movie, excluding the ones about sex, were just hammed up too much and over-scripted to be funny, except if you absolutely LOVE Adam Sandler and are used to this approach. In my opinion, if you want parody movies, look up Mel Brooks, or that ""Kung Pow: Enter the Fist""...or just rent the ""Dentist 2"" or ""The Ice Cream Man"" and do your own MST3K."
2,The laughs are forced on you- and not very well.,"First, let me say that this is not my type of humor. That is my bias. That being said, Scary Movie is the type of movie that begs and pleads for you to laugh at every given moment. It almost looks like the actors just pause for an instant and wait for you to burst out into tear-filled hysteria.The movie is what it is. There's no point in saying this movie isn't intelligent-that wasn't the goal here. If you like sight-gags and parody driven plots - then rejoice because this is your movie!"
2,NOT 'Scary',"I thought I was going to watch a real scary movie, but I got this horrible spoof instead. Wait, it was horrifyingly bad, ha! From ""Scream"" to ""The Blair Witch Project,"" I was thorougly agitated with this smelly film. The Wayans brothers usually make me laugh, but not this time. Good thing Damon skipped this piece of vomit. The film tries to be clever by using the plot of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and ""Scream,"" but loses its originality with too many kielbasa sausage jokes. The most horrifying scene showed Ms. Mann and its secret. I don't remember laughing or even smiling during this movie. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, who has done better working with Steven Seagal, also stars, Shannon Elizabeth and Shawn and Marlon Wayans. Too bad such talent came together for this wasted movie..."
3,Disgustingly Funny,"Raunchy and gross humor is quite popular these days. But ""Scary Movie"" tops it. Most of the actors in the movie were unknown until this film, but they continue to get dumb, unintelligent roles. See what this movie can do to your career? Anyway, the movie is very funny and I was laughing thtoughout the whole thing. However, I saw this movie with my mother. Never make that mistake! I'm not going to say anything bad about this movie, because it was quite good. But outrageous!"
2,"""Scream 3"" Was Funnier","Here's my problem with ""Scary Movie"": It spends so much time trying to sick you out it loses focus of what it is supposed to be doing: spoofing scary movies. The plot was good: a group of friends hit a man -who doesn't actually at first- and a year later find notes and a ghost masked killer after them. Smart plot mixing ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and ""Scream"" together. Even the ""Matrix"" fight was neat. So let me return to my problem. If they would have just left it as spoofing movies and not become the Gross-Out-Movie-Of-The-Week, we would all be in good shape. ... ."
3,Scary Movie,"It's a funny movie, though funny-stupid. It's the parody of couple of the movies, which makes it even more interesting and funny. ""I know what you did last summer"", ""Scream"", and ""The Matrix"" are couple of the movies that you might recognize while watcing Scary movie. It's dumb, but it's funny. You don't have to think a lot while watchig it. Fun to watch with a group of people."
3,"Not bad, but horribly dated","Silly humor is probably one of the trickiest art forms. Parodies also fall into that category. And this film is a perfect examples of what separates an amusing movie from a classic.To begin with, a lot of this humor is just too lowbrow. I have nothing against lowbrow, but gross out jokes get old real fast, so you've got to have something else. Unfortunately, this movie has too many one joke scenes that stretch on too long. It's a very fine line between funny and kind of stupid, and clearly the Wayans Bros. don't always know the difference.The other fatal flaw involves parodies. When you make a beat-for-beat parody, you risk losing the part of the audience that hasn't seen what you're making fun of. There were jokes here based on fads I had to strain to remember. And we're talking about a movie made about five years ago.It's an okay film with a few chuckles. Nothing special. If you're a fan of the genre, you'll probably enjoy it once or twice. But that's about it."
4,Surprisingly good,"This movie was surprisingly better than I expected it would be. Seeing how those 'Scream' type movies got stale so fast, I figured it wouldn't be that good, but it was better than expected. The directing was good, the scenes worked quite well, and the actors were all pretty well suited for their roles. The movie was extremely funny, some of my faves included Cindy's quite 'untypical' father, and the scene at the movie theater. The movie even contained a shock ending. And Anna Faris has got to be the hottest actress in the business today. However, the movie certainly wasn't perfect. My biggest gripe was the overuse of a certain part of the male anatomy. Seeing how the primary audience of this movie would be males, I don't see why they had to include that. However, outside of that, there was pretty much no problems at all."
3,"Uhhhhh, OK.","This would be a great movie to watch with a large group of people. THere are far too many, shall we say, disgusting parts to actually sit down and watch this one on your own. While Scary Movie does have its moments (The I know what you did last summer (or Halloween) scene is great), there are enough other problems to overshadow the funny parts. Had they left out most of the sex jokes, it would have been a much better movie."
3,Fairly Good...Not What You Expect From Watching Previews,"I think this movie had its shares of laughs, but there were so many parts that was just flat out stupid. still, its defintely worth watching if you enjoy laughing a lot...But dont set your expectation too high...cuz they will be let down...."
2,Hated it,"I've been on this earth for damn near 23 years. I've seen quite a few things seeing as how I've recently entered my third decade of life. Death by penis, however, is one thing I had not seen until I saw Scary Movie. To be quite honest, I could have lived without it. This generally stale movie did have it's moments, but they were all able to be fit nice and snug into the trailer, perhaps one of the funniest of all time. If I was writing this review for the trailer I'd give it two snaps up in a blink. The Wayans brothers, however, manage to take that brilliant trailer, interspersing crude and unfunny jokes with the occasional impaling penis, and turn it into a less than sterling comedy. From now on, the only way I'm watching a Wayans in a movie is if he's dressed up like a clown and hitting people over the head with a toy bat."
4,Made me laugh alot!,"If you have not seen the scream movies, you probably won't find this scary movie very amusing. Otherwise, I had a great time watching this and it made me laugh outload more than a few times. There are some parts that may offend some people, but just keep in mind that it is just one of those movies that is not to be taken very seriously."
5,Amazing Movie ;,"If you are a big horror movie buff, and you like comedy also..then this is the movie for you. It's so funny, and if you saw all the horror movies that they make fun of in this movie, then you will think its a great movie to. Deff. worth buying."
2,Getting your money's worth?,"Scary Movie is a great movie (that's the only reason I give it 2 stars) I bet you all know the storyline so I won't bore you any further. Now, the big letdown with this disc is that you don't get the whole movie.. I know about at least one scene which has been edited. The ""Helpless cheerleader""-scene has a vital thing missing.. You don't get to see her guts beeing ripped out. I have seen the scene in all of it's g(l)ory and believe me, you DO wanna see this. Now, give me an uneditet Scary Movie and I'll pay as much as they want."
2,"Scary Movie may be only 2 stars, but's its funny as hell!",I enjoyed watching this laugh-your-but-off comedy that parodies Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. I loved it from beginning to end; there was at least three or four laughs A MINUTE! If you love comedies this is the movie to see. It's better than I expected!
4,The Wayans make the best spoofs!,The best spoof since Don't be a menace... which also stared Marlon and Shawn Wayans. The plot is primarly the plot of scream 1 but there are jokes about a few others including The Sixth Sense and The Matrix.Scary Movies really is a joke a minute sort of flick some outrageously funny! There are some very funny characters although some of the jokes are quite sick. If you havnt Scream yet then rent that first or you won't appreciate the jokes as much. Definatly worth seeing.
1,Crude and Lame,"I deplored this waste of a perfectly good idea on such a trashy film. Not only was it completely not funny, aside from a handful of good moments that you have already seen on the commercials and trailers, this film has nothing to offer the person coming in for the cheap laugh, or especially for the person coming for a serious gag. Between the good parts, the rest is basically just homophobic filler and will make you want to vomit if you have half an ounce of good taste. The only thing of lower quality than the movie is the DVD. What junk is this? I rented it and couldn't play it on my player on my TV, I had to go to a buddie's house to watch it, and it sucked. Where is the ""hillarious comedy"" I was promised? Watching this film made me want to hang myself"
4,FBI warning fix!!,"OK, my player also showed the FBI warning thing... so, what you do is when you first put the DVD is press 'stop' so the FBI warning doesn't show up and your stop menu does... then push 'play' and voila! oh, my review... VERY funny! a must-see!"
2,Parody,"This is a parody of several horror films, namely Scream. Horror buffs may or may not like this, but others probably won't get the joke."
3,Why?,"Why did the makers of this movie feel the need to take all the potential for greatness that it had and make a sick movie (a much more accurate name)? Although this movie is hysterical, the amount of nudity and sexual humor make the movie hard to watch. While it's humor towers triumphantly over it's somewhat sister movie, Shriek if you Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth, the content of the aforementioned movie makes it the better of the two.If you enjoy seeing the male anatamy before you in a perverted and disgusting manner, then this movie will be perfect for you. If, like me, you'd much rather watch a movie that doesn't involve constant anatomical jokes, then skip this one. The third is much better, anyway."
1,Funny?,"Was A Scary Movie funny? Yes. What was funny was how this noncreative, unimaginative, piece of trash even made it to the screen. You would have had to smoke as much dope as they did in this movie to even find it worth snickering at. They took every nasty, foul, perverted subject, mixed it with the plots of movies that were worth watching, and spewed forth this disgusting concoction. It is no wonder that the Wayans Brother's show was cancelled. And I must shame the people in charge of giving this movie an R rating when it easily could have and should have gotten an X, but I guess money speaks louder than basic rating guidelines. If this movies speaks for what future generations will call funny, then God help us all."
1,Horrible Blu-Ray Picture,"If you have the regular DVD, do not buy the Blu-ray. It is the worst Blu-Ray DVD I have seen, there is no high def in this transfer. The picture looks digitalized and I was very disapointed with this purchase, don't waste your money on this one."
1,What a waste!,"If I could use this DVD for toilet paper, at least it would provide some value to me. Because that is where this movie belongs, ""in the toilet"". I have never seen a movie that is so filled with insulting and degrading ""so called"" humor. Parts of it were so bad that I used the fast forward key numerous times. I do not mind R rated movies and I own several that I consider excellent shows. This is not an R rated movie, it should be rated X, but alas they don't have that rating anymore. To anyone who might consider buying this movie, I can give you exact directions to the local landfill where my copy will reside."
1,Isn't there already a parody of scary movies?,"Uh yeah it was called SCREAM! So whats the use of parodying a parody? This movie was such a waste, All that gross stuff was unecessary. And how about a CLUE to Hollywood, enough with the gross stuff, its NOT FUNNY! Whatever happened to pure comedy? Stuff that was funny cause it was brilliantly written, and was witty. Go rewatch Liar Liar, or Analyize this. Two movies that didn't lower themselves to the level of trash to be funny. More of that and LESS of these gross out UNFUNNY comedies.If you thought this movie was funny, Get yourselves to Church and Repent! Or go watch Barney, cause that must be your educational level."
1,The silliest movie of all time!,"This one should have been rated R. It's stupid, disgusting and not scary at all. I got to laugh a couple of times and that was it. I value my time at theaters, and movies like this one really upset me."
3,Not really good.... but it is funny though,"If you think that this is a REALLY scary movie, forget about it. If you think that you can find a good plot here, dream on. BUT, this movie is a good spoof for Matrix, I know what you did last summer, etc. The humour is not great, but it is entertaining. Don't expect this one to be a real good one, watch it when you want some humour to make your day. Don't worry, you can watch it at mid-nite because SCARY MOVIE is NOT a SCARY MOVIE."
4,Very Funny,"If you see the VCD version, you will notice that its not the same movie, most scenes were added and modified, in this DVD release , some scenes were modified and cuted from the original version that passed in theaters in America. ( they were added in the deleted scenes, in the bonus )"
5,I THINK THIS IS VERY FUNNY,I THINK THIS MOVIE IS A GREAT COMEDY!I LOVE THIS MOVIE ITS SO FUNNY IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS MOVIE THEN GO GET IT!OFICER DOOFY IS COOL. OFICER IS THE BEST!
5,This movie is great!,"I saw this movie the day it opened and it was great.Their are many site gags in this movie like the name of the school,B.A. Corpse highschool, and a coroner car parked in the parking lot.Many people probally missed a great gag if they hadn't seen the original Scream with principal Squiggy,following along the lines of the ""Fonz"" playing the principal in the original.A must see."
2,Not happy,"DVD only works first 5 minutes, movie scratched. Movie continues to not work even after out threw cleaning machine. Waste of money!"
1,Just Another Corny Wayans Movie.......,"All I can say is that this movie is just another typical Wayans movie. If U really enjoy raunchy, crude behavior this movie is filled with it and U would enjoy from beginning 2 end."
3,Scary Movie,"Well it was funny but not funny enough. We see Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Matrix and The Sixth Sense all mixed into one. During the movie there are parts you wouldn't want to see unless you are gay. But even though Scary Movie was funny that in some ways its worth watching and in other ways you wouldn't care to see. Scary Movie 2 shall hit theaters 2001."
4,"Sidesplitingly Funny,Imature,Gross,Sick,WAY COOL Movie!!!","Have you all seen any Scream movies? Or I Know What You Did Last Summer,Cherry Falls,Friday The 13th or anything along those lines? If you have you already know the plot to Scary Movie!Big Breasted heroine runs down dark corridor by ''Stalk And Slash'' maniac.But well there is no other way to put it.A FILM THAT RIPS THE PISH OUT OF SLASHER FILMS!!!!!You knew it was going to happen someday and it did.But this rude and crude,extremley funny movie works so well they are making a [duh,duh,duh!!!] sequel!This movie makes fun of LOTS of movies.Scream,I Know What You Did Last Summer,The Blair Witch Project to name a few.But hey right from Carmen Electras ''Safety or Death?'' killing right up to the ending you laugh,laugh,laugh,laugh,laugh and guess what...you LAUGH!!!9 out of 10"
4,Pretty Good!!!,"I really have to give to Keenan Ivory Wayans. I don't believe this kind of movie would have worked had it been PG-13.This also shows that there is no such thing as 'Black' movies as this piece has a variety of characters from different backgrounds, and a story and subject matter geared toward everyone(well, not EVERYONE--young adults, and the adventurous)...As an African-American young man with a goal toward the movie business, this movie has a big welcome from me...By the way, kudos to Shannon Elizabeth and Anna Faris who very much add to the movie's 'babe' factor."
4,i've never laughed so much,i went to see scary movie last night (first night showing over here-uk) and i have never laughed so much in all my life...maybe coz it appealed to my sick sense of humour (you need to have one to watch this) but it was brilliant. i know it rips off other movies but it does it in an laughable manner so you can't help but laugh at the gags....i definately recommend this to any teenager and anybody else who thinks they can stomach the crude jokes!
2,Not-So-Great-As-It-Seems...,"I'll admit, I was one of the hundreds of people that wanted to see the new horror/comedy flick ""Scary Movie"". The advertisments on TV made it a ""Must See"" on my list of things to do. I'll tell you now though, it's not all it's cut up to be, seriously. It's all sex-based and they gave away the majority of the funny parts in the previews. I'll also admit that I did laugh at some parts, but in all honesty, it was corny, and sick. I love a raunchy joke just as much as the next person, but this went over the top. Big time."
1,so disgusting,i think this movie is horrible.it has horrible scenes in it and is really impure.i think anyone who thinks this is funny has a bad sense of humor.
1,Not Funny,"After watching this movie, I am surprised that it made any money in the theaters. It had a few funny parts but unless you are totally into horror movies or spoofs, I would not waste time or money on it."
4,Really Funny Movie,"I saw this movie a while ago with a whole bunch of my friends and we laughed all the time. Their are so many jokes and only a couple of them are stupid. The people who say the jokes only appeal to the 'stupider' or 'low-brow' audiences are just to stupid to understand them. Overall, it's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I dropped it to a 4 though because a couple jokes fell flat. Oh, and there was two much male nudity and not enough female nudity. That's all. Bye."
1,IT STINKS!!,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Tim Curry could've done WAY better than this piece of [junk]... (pardon my French). If they had a '0 star' rating, I would have picked that one for sure. It wasn't even funny. It probably would have been funny if they didn't do all those disgusting things. AND THE LANGUAGE!!! I NEVER heard so much foul language from anyone's mouth in my life. When I bought it, I thought it was going to be good. The advertisements about it on TV looked good. I don't recommend this movie to anyone, especially little kids. The TV ads made it look like it was a good, funny, family movie. What I do recommend is that you rent any movie first before you buy."
4,Scary Movie 1 is a 4 Star DVD,"This is my second favorite of all the scary movies in the series. This was when the series wasn't getting boring and repetitive. The scary movie series kind of started a new era when it comes to movie spoofs. I have to say I am a huge scary movie fan but the comedy in this movie is hilarious. They use spoofs from all kinds of movies from scream, Halloween. The movie flowed well and the content well it was a little over the edge that's what made the scary movie series great. The third and fourth one seemed softer and since they knew they were going to get viewers either way I feel they made it softer and PG-13 so more kids could watch it. Overall this is definitely worth a look for one time around. I would even recommend that you pick up the second DVD as well but I would not go buy the third or fourth. A funny movie and something to watch with your friends."
3,"Funny at times, too gross at others...","This movie is a spoof of (mainly) 'I know what you did last summer' and 'Scream' (which was originally titled 'Scary Movie', by the way), with small references to other movies such as 'The Matrix', 'The Sixth Sense', etc.Many of the jokes / situation were classic (my favorite was the 'Drew' scene, mimicking Drew Barrimore's famous creepy scene from 'Scream'). Others, on the other hand, were too gross and childish (at least to my not - too - picky taste)."
3,Not very scary but kind of nasty,"I've been avoiding reviewing this video because the dialog is sort of crude. To be more specific (bleep this out if you want) when that girl says ""oops I farted"" I became nauseated. Not my kind of flick I lost interest about half-way through and turned it off.That phoney ghost just makes me want to puke."
3,Scary,"When I heard of this movie, I thought it would be funny, because it made fun of all those annoying horror/mystery movies that kept coming out one after the other, with a ""masked"" killer. It was okay, but all the fart/sexual jokes and stoned jokes really started to get old. I started getting annoyed more than I laughed. I liked it when that Sydney/Julie girl with a body hair problem got hit with the car. The retarded Dewey really annoyed me and grossed me out. This whole movie bordered on gross. When the movie ended I was ready to leave."
2,"Some funny scenes, but basically a funny porn movie.","This movie covers all the bases in shocking people...sex, drugs, gore, male nudity...you name it. However shock doesn't mean laughter. I found myself cringing through out alot of the movie. There was some laughs, but the movie beat the jokes to death. You would laugh first and then uggh! This movie is not for for kids, or adults for that matter. It's pretty much a universal teen movie. So be warned!"
4,"Satirical and immature... overall, a great comedy","If you're someone who loves the satire genre and doesn't mind a venture into the immature, this movie is right up your alley. It takes a nice blend of recent horror flicks and exploits every nook and cranny of them for a cheap laugh. While the plot itself was somewhat twisted (people who didn't see Scream may have no idea what the plot is) it was worth following just to see the antics around every corner. I was looking forward to buying it on the way out of the theater. Definitely one to give at least a fair chance no matter what your take on recent horror films is."
3,Nonsense Glorified !,"This is a movie that spoofs the nonsense in other movies, specifically I Know What you did Last Summer. I havent seen Scream or I Know... but the references are unmistakably funny.The humor is downright sexist and crude, but its really hilarious when compared with the original movie. The scenes where the case is told that 'someone knows' is downright crude and rubbish... and is hilarious in the creativity of the story writers. The opening sequence is another classic in spoofing. This movie is made on the lines of Mad comix, so if you like the humor there, you will enjoy this.Best seen with a group of friends, preferably male, and to be seen after seeing I Know... and Scream. Ideal for a weekend of nonsense and chilling at home!"
3,SILLY MOVIE,"I watched scary movie at the theatre and on video. The movie was funny and silly at the same time. Especially when the voluptious young Drew Decker tries to escape from the killer who is after her, and she stops in the middle of the yard all wet after running through a springler to show off her lovely body and caress her breasts while the killer is behind her. I found that particular scene funny because there were so many ways she could avoided her death and she chose to ignore them. The rest of the movie was somewhat funny and vulgar."
2,....,"Scary movie was a sad attempt to satarize real ""scary movies."" In addition to it's predictability, it was filled with bland humor. Oh yes, some parts did make you smile, perhaps even giggle, but over all it was a waste of my $7.00. It's only one of many movies today making an effort to mock popular teen movies. My suggestion, see a real teen movie. Because you know the joke you're in for when you go to see it."
4,Hilarious movie,"Scary Movie is a hilarious movie, starring Anna Faris as Cindy, and my favorite character, the stoner Shorty. The movie begins, with a hilarious scene, which is the perfect parody of Scream's first scene. For example, Drew answers the killers question of what's your favorite scary movie by saying Kazaam, the one where Shaq plays a genie. There are many other hilarious moments and one liners, like when the murder hides from our heroine Cindy behind a couch. However, there are some extremely sick parts, like when Ray goes into the bathroom, but don't let the few parts like that stop you from seeing this hilarious movie, but I do suggest that if you haven't Scream, you might want to see that first."
4,The 1st In A Good Series Of Movies,Well All Of The New Horror Movies To Come out In The last 5-8 Years or So Are Spoofed In This Very Funny Parody Of horror Movies.The Plot Is basically Makes Fun Of Scream And I Know What U Did Last Summer Throwing in Cliches To the Sixth Sense And The Blair Witch Project.The Waynes Brothers Put The Best Proformece In The Movie Along With Anna Faris.Great Spoof A Must Own For comedy And Spoof Lovers
1,Please let me die,"I know there are a lot of people out there who will tell you things like ""this movie is hilarious"" or ""It's a masterpiece"" or ""I watched this movie one night and the next day the cyst was gone!"" Don't listen to them. This movie is the embodiment of what's wroong with the modern american comedy. The jokes are WAY too obvious. There is absolutely no subtlety whatsoever in this movie. Instead of the subtle, intelligent kind of humor we see in movies like ""Annie Hall"" and ""Tootsie"", we find a battering-ram-at-the-castle-gates kind of humor, wherein they beat you over the head with the comedy without generating even one honest, genuine chuckle. Gone are the days of wittier spoofs like ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun."" Instead, we have this load of gross-outs and fart jokes that actually succeeds at being less funny than the Carrot Top movie. And you know what the worst part is? It's still a better movie than anything Adam Sandler ever made. Groan."
1,the end is near,"That anyone at all found this movie funny is sad. That America rushed to the theaters in drooling droves is enough to make you want to call it quits. Sure, it's raunchy. Sure, it's over the top. But the jokes are also unfunny, completely unfunny. They run the full gamut from totally uninspired gags to rip-offs of preexisting totally uninspired gags. That's the true sign of a comedy utterly devoid of worth: it can't even pick good jokes to steal. This wretched, tired, hideous waste of celluloid could only be worth renting as a sociological study, or as proof that it's about time for God to end this misguided experiment we call humanity."
2,Barely a Movie,"Stay a way from this movie. Although the trailers make this movie out to be a hilarious spoof, they are lying. This movie has about 5 minutes of actual spoof comedy, the rest is sex joke. And they aren't even funny. They consist of pubic hair, sveral comments(and visual aids) about how ""big"" a guy is, the ""first time"", and several homosexual jokes. There are very few funny scenes, the rest are just gross. So any one under 13, and over sixteen should not see this movie. I'm Kale Arndt and that's my story and I am sticking to it."
1,Simply the worst movie ever made,"vile, disgusting, trash. the bargain bin at Costco is too good for it. Nuff said."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER!,"this movie was the poorest made piece of garbage ever. i have nothing against vulgarity or anything but the vulgarity in this movie was used so terribly unfunny. the actors were terrible and couldnt even pull of the poorly written jokes they were supposed to. if your lookin for something funny go buy the south park movie. not this thing. i think i laughed one time when i watched this movie....when it was over! if you have the intelligence of an acorn then you might like this movie, but if you are a normal person then stay away from it."
2,R Rated Comedy,This movie was mainly about all the other scary movies of the summer. They combined them and made an r rated comedy. It had lots of nudity and adult language. They took certian parts out of other movies and put them all together and got a bunch of garbage that didn't make any sense.Next time I will read reviews about movies before I spend my money. They should give all the money they made to a charity and never try to make another movie of this sort.
4,Ellis keeps it up,"This held up to the earlier Planetary episodes but was sometimes frustrating in it's ""mysteriousness"". There's a great issue which is a kind of what-if homage to a couple DC heroes who are not actually named. It's so creepy that I can't stop thinking about it. It's rare that I read something that powerful. I'm very interested in where this is story is going and can't wait to get the 3rd installment."
4,hater,"The story is awesome. The art is superb. I, however, have a huge complaint with Ellis's writing. The man cannot write a sentence to save his life. I find myself frustrated and confused more often than not. Part of this might be his work load. He may be stretching himself too thin. Moreover, whoever edits his comics (especially, on Avatar) should focus on the words and the syntax over story and panel directing - or whatever comic-book editors do. I'm not trying to be a jerk, just venting some frustration toward an otherwise fine creator."
1,Poor Design,"This is a heads up to Amazon customers interested in purchasing an Olympus E Volt 300. It could be a great camera but it has a serious design flaw that should make you pause and consider the competition before buying. The remote release (RM-CB 1) will not plug into the camera body. You have to buy this HLD-3 ""adapter"" for almost $100 just to ""adapt"" the remote release to the camera body. Couple that ""surpise"" with the $75 or so for the RM-CB 1 remote release and one is faced with $175+ just for a remote shutter release. What adds insult to injury is that the ""adapter"" is really ""clunky"" on top of that. Check out what the competition has to offer before you purchase the Olympus E Volt 300."
4,Good Binoculars,"This is my second purchase of this item. First was perfect. This one has a small issue barely worth mentioning. The zoom lever has a couple of rough spots when zooming, but might get smoother with use.Otherwise, I'm very happy with these."
3,Big View-Big Binocular,"Bushnell make wonderful products, The binoculars are handy on hikes and concerts but the one wish I have is for a lightweight small Bioncular with the same low cost and more viewing power."
1,?,i havent gotten my camera yet..and tell me somethin is the camera really smalive viewed the pictures of it and the camera looks great..but i hope it isnt really super smallsoo if u have this kind of camera please post a video or a written review please
1,BAD BUSSINESS,"THE CANNON A75 CAMERA WAS BROKEN.AND THE SELLER WOULD NOT ANSWER EMAIL OR PHONE CALLS.WHITCH MADE ME THINK SHE KNEW IT WAS BROKEN WHEN SHE MAILED IT.AND NOW I AM OUT OF 103.00 DOLLARS.BAD BUSSINESS......,"
1,Do NOTrecommend CANNON cameras,I have had two Cannon digital cameras. Both have suddenly stopped working after a few months with an E18 error. This error seems to be common among Cannon cameras. It appears the lens motor stops working. Nothing you can do about it.
3,Its ok,"I got this camera for my 7-year-old girl.I compare this camera with my cameras and it does crappy pics.However, for her what else I want?She is very happy with this camera and it is easy to use for herso I do recommend this for a kid."
2,I didn't take the warnings...,"Got this camera for Christmas. I loved it, the quality of pictures was way better than my old Sony Cybershot. It's been less than a month and it got the infamous E18 error. I didn't have a clue what it was...I thought I accidently swung it into a wall or something...Apparently not... I went to Wal-Mart photo center...The guy knew right away what it was and gave me the number to call. I sent it in today for fixing. I have the warranty...So hopefully all I have to pay is that 3 bucks for shipping.I also heard though that even though they fix it under warranty...The problem still has a good chance of coming back. *sigh*...200 bucks down the drain (possibly)...I'm back to using my Sony camera...I've had it for a year...And hey the pictures aren't awesome but at least it still freaking works."
1,Camera Doesn't retract after,"I bought a Canon A70. I am hear to warn you that it will eventually not retract if jarred. Some people say it's an E18 error. You can google that, but I just know that canon charges $100-$200 to repair and charges for shipping both ways... Not worth it. Investigate what your brand will do for you, if something goes wrong before you buy! Have a Great Day!"
3,Didn't Like It,"Hi, I previous owned a Canon A40, and I was very satisfy with that camera, I really liked it. Later I upgraded to this one (A75): More pixels (from 2 to 3.2), Large viefinder (1.8""), more video capacity (up 3 min) and extra stuffs. But I was very surprised not to see what I was expecting ... The pictures were fussy, a lot of Red Eyes (even with the red eye reduction On), quality not so good in some cases.I'm a snapshooter and all I want is to put in Auto (Large and Superfine) and take pics, But i didn't like how they looked like, specially in dark situations it was very dissapointing to me.The movie option is very good, up to 30 sec in Large (640x480) .. up 3 min. in smaller format. You can edit them directly in the camera and hear them. Nice!I sold it, I'm going to continue with Canon beacause i think they're the best, now i'm going to buy the A400 and see."
4,Great lil cam!! :),"I bought this camera online from Target about 2 months ago and I love it! It has many differant features that make it great to work with. There are a few drawbacks but they are minor... It takes regular AA batteries and can suck the life out of those quite fast, so I would reccomend you buy rechargeables for this bad boy; The auto focus isn't that great so sometimes you end up with a blurry picture. Also when you take video in dim light it shows up kind of dark since there is no light on the camera... But it is an otherwise great camera. This is the first Digital camera I have purchased for myself, I have used many I just didn't own one... LoL It has been wonderful for catching all the special moments I have with my son. Two thumbs WAY WAY up!! :)"
1,defective product,"This digital camera was malfunctioning when it arrived. I had to replace my own camera which was about 10 years old, as I have an expensive underwater case that is custom-fit for this camera. It was unusable and it was returned for a refund."
1,Check the Internet First,"You do NOT want to buy this camera. It does take great pictures and it is one of the lowest priced considering all of the features you get, but it is very unreliable. My first one (the A70 model) worked great for a year and then died. The second (A75) worked for a week and then got the E18 error which has something to do with a design flaw in the lens movement motors. Just do a web search for ""powershot A75 error"" and see what you find.I am going to try to get my money back."
3,messed up after 2 years of careful usage,"It was a pretty good camera until Canon came up with this tiny bit of cameras which does not require 4 AA batteries. Man, that is so unfair!Anyway, I still used it, it drinks the batteries very quickly.I would definitely pay a little bit more and buy a s300 or sth better.Now, after 2 years, suddenly, no falling, no nothing, its display is not working and it will not take any pictures.So I am left with it. I am planning to buy a sony this time, hope I will be lucky."
5,Simple & Easy To Use,"I just received my Canon A75 Camera yesterday, And I have already been using it on a regular basis. I have viewed my pictures on th TV sreen, downloaded them to my computer, made a slide show & more.The manual is very good with describing how do do things. I have yet to get into the camera's more advanced features, but I have looked into a few of them, and it was very simple and straight forward. The quality of the pictures are great, I even did a quick film, complete with sound. I looked into Digital Cameras for a while, and for the money, this is a can't miss camera."
1,It doesn't last long,"I owned a Kodak DC3400 before and the Canon Powershot A75 seemed so much better when I started using it. It took great pictures, no complains there, great saturation and focus. About 11 months later it started to have glitches. At first it would auto switch from capture mode to playback mode, making it impossible to take pictures. Eventually the capture mode would kick in and after a few shots...bang!..all by itself the camera would switch to playback mode again. This was very annoying and it continued for awhile until recently.Now my camera only previews images that are stored in the memory card but CAN'T take pictures. The lens does not open no matter what I try.I have searched the internet intensively and discovered that I'm not alone; many people are experiencing similar situations. I don't think that the Canon Powershot series was built to last.Take my advice: Avoid this camera!"
1,Very very soft pictures,"Camera has tons of features. Metering and exposures appear to be very good as well. Very easy to use.But the picture quality is very POOR - pictures appear to be very soft. By adjusting ISO to 50, it gets a little sharper but still not sharp enough."
1,Great camera until the E18 failure,I have a Canon A70 that until recently was a great camera. On a trip to the Grand Canyon the camera failed. Lens would not retract and E18 error appeared on screen. I thought it was just bad luck until I got home and Googled the E18. Discovered that this was a common complaint and that it is a waste of my time to pursue this with Canon. I am now looking at other brands for a replacement.
2,broke easily,I bought this camera four years ago and it broke twice already. Definitely not a sturdy one.
5,What an awesome little camera!,"There is so much to like about this camera that I don't know where to begin! According to Consumer Reports, it has the best battery life on the market and the image quality is top-notch. It's compact enough to fit in a shirt pocket, is loaded with extra functions and features, and for the price will not let you down!"
1,CCD Problem...,"This camera died after two years, thanks to its defective Sony CCD. Now it only takes purplish pictures. Do a web search for ""canon CCD problem""Update: After months of being unable to use the camera and finally tired of hearing the ""we don't have spare parts"" excuse from Canon Ecuador, I took it on a vacation to Chile and gave it to my brother, who lives there. Canon Chile kindly repaired the camera at no cost, but it took about a month."
3,Broken like others....,"Unforutnately we did not heed the warnings; the compact flash slot on these cameras is NOT good. Brand new out of the box it was defective, which is a common complaint. Canon must do something about this, because it is otherwise a fantastic camera, for a great, great price. We will likely buy another Canon (they make good digital), or try again."
1,Two of them both broke,I bought the A75 for both of my sons. Both cameras go the E18 message and never worked again. The lens stays out and I can't get them back in.
1,Don't buy it,"Don't buy it if you want your digital camera lasting for more than 2 years. Both my friend and I bought one three years old. Now, the camera won't show the image on the screen. I can't take any photo.Sigh! I am disappointed with 2 years life time."
4,Great Camera when Batteries Work,I really like my camera. It takes great pictures. The only problem that I have is the batteries. I purchase new batteries and they don't seem to work. I usually have to go thru several AA batteries before the camera actually turns on. It's quite fustrating when you put new batteries and nothing works. I suggest getting the battery charger although I do not have one myself but am considering it.
3,Great point and shoot camera,"I got this camera over a year ago. I am very satisfied with the quality of the images. It does have a few limitations.1. Cannot shoot action shots because of the 1 second delay when auto focus is ""on"".2. Cannot shoot bright objects - they will over saturate.3. Occasional glitch when camera will not switch to capture mode.4. The viewfinder does not show the full view of the digital capture-only LCD show the true field of capture.5. Auto focus does not work well in low-light situations.6. Flash is too strong for close-up shoot.7. 3X optical zoom not quite enough and 10X digital zoom lead to noisy images(almost useless feature).Other than these, the camera is easy to use and handle.Recommend you get 256KB flash memory and 4 rechargeable batteries. You can take up to 250 shots. Great for vacations."
5,Lavish with color reproductions of Travilla's art,"Travilla became a Hollywood star thanks in large part to his client Marilyn Monroe, gaining fame for his design of her costumes - but his art graced many familiar forms, and Hollywood Costume Design By Travilla provides an excellent display of his original sketches and creations. Monroe fans and Hollywood fans alike will relish this display, lavish with color reproductions of Travilla's art."
5,Mr. St. Nick,This is part of my Christmas DVD collection. What a wonderful updating of what Santa can become as generations change their perspective of what Santa is.
3,Good clean holiday entertainment,This is a good entry for the christmas movie genre. Yes it's predictable in it's intent and content. If you like old fashion movies ( 30's 40's ) you'll like this movie. There seems to be a trend in the christmas movie genre to have a younger image attached to the santa claus persona and this is no exception to that trend. We are talking in the last maybe 10 years or so of course. The leads are good and play their characters out very convincing. Of Kelsey Grammer is Kelsey Grammer but he's utilized in a good way. Ana Ortiz is well cast as the good girl next door trying to make it in America with typical yet dopy ( immigration agent nardo ) obsticles in her way. Once again this is a christmas movie with cliche's abounding thru out. If you are looking for lite fare with no car chases and good family fun this is your movie.
5,Mr. St. Nick,I had seen this movie on TV once and I just had to have it and I am glad you had it for sale. I enjoy it very much and it is a very good movie.
3,Wish the handle were larger,This is a beautiful mug with a lifetime break guarantee but I wish that the handle were a bit larger for people with big hands as well as those who are arthritic.
4,Nonstop emotion...,"When I bought this cd like a year or so back, I got to admit I listened to it for like two weeks, and wasn't very impressed with it...I liked maybe three songs. Well I've been listening to it recently and realized I didn't give it enough of a chance, cause it's actually really good. They remind me of an exact blend of Allister, Rufio, and Matchbook Romance. The insane driving catchy emotional guitar buildups never stop, and it's just one of those albums that's catchy without being blatant. The album booms of chords you've heard in every hit pop punk song, but they have their own catchy style, always doing things that make it work. A very good cd..."
4,Andrew Henry's Meadow,"My grandson Timothy loved it. He is just starting out as a reader. A story like this, I hope will encorage him to read often."
5,perfect for first grade,"I happened uponthis book while on vacation near the author's home. I found it delightful with an engaging story and pictures that can be examined over and over again. My son shared this book with his first grade class and the teacher called me to ask if she could keep it for a while to read to the other first grade sections. She raved about the book saying, ""It is perfect for first graders"". My only quibble about the book might be some mild sterotyping about what boys do vrs what girls do (boys build and fish, girls watch birds and play music)"
5,A Must-Have!,"About 15 years ago I scoured my local library in search of this book. It is the only book from my childhood that I have actively sought as an adult, and after having read all 50 reviews thus far posted here it is clear it was a favorite of many, enough to send them on similar scavenger's hunts. Not recalling the title or author, my only search image to go on was that it had a limey green hardcover, about 9"" x 12"", and I swore that the cover picture was of a boy walking away from the reader down a fence line, his footprints visible in the tall grass he was walking through, a tall canopy tree on the left side. Having only just submitted my order I can't wait to find this picture somewhere in the beginning of the book. I also can't wait to see all the other illustrations I spent so many hours pouring over - my imagination on fire. I ordered 11 copies (1 original and 10 new to give away)."
4,One of my favorites,There was something about the wonder of creating something on your own that has always made me like this book. The copy my mother bought me in 1965 survived 37 years but not a few minutes with one of my curious and mischievous sons. What a joy it was that my wife found a replacement copy on Amazon - thank you!
4,A Delightful Fantasy About a Secret Hideout,"Andrew Henry excels at building inventions, but his creations annoy his family and outgrow for his house, so one day he goes away to find a meadow where he can build a house of his own. One by one his friends from town find him, and he builds a custom home for each friend. After some time, the children's parents come in search of them. Everyone goes home, and Andrew's parents give him a place in the basement for his inventions.This lighthearted fantasy appeals to the childhood delight of a secret hideout. Andrew Henry's generosity, creativity and skill are portrayed as qualities to be admired, and the parents' search for the missing children evokes a warm sense of community. The illustrations are wonderfully detailed, especially Andrew Henry's inventions. The story will appeal to most children, but especially those budding engineers who enjoy building (or disassembling) complex structures."
5,My favorite childhood book,I am so excited to have found that I can actually track down a copy of my favorite long lost childhood story book! I too dreamed of being able to join Andrew Henry in his meadow and play in his amazing forts. I have a two year old daughter who loves to be read to and I can't wait to share this story with her. I can't help but wonder what else I have in common with others who have chosen this book as their favorite childhood story.
5,Possibly the greatest book ever next to the Bible!,"This book is a classic. The 'Meadow' will be forever etched in my mind. The detailed drawings, the story line, the quiet hopes of Andrew Henry - it is truly an unforgettable story."
5,This book stays with you,"Andrew Henry's Meadow is one of those childhood books you never forget. My copy, although falling apart, is something I won't let go-what a shame it's gone out of print! I spent long moments studying the pictures (they're in black and white) and wondering about all the characters. It's a timeless story of growing up, if you are lucky enough to have a copy, hang on to it and share it with the children around you."
5,Nice CD/DVD Combo,"For a fan of the group, this was a good find. It was also a great value for a bit of nostalgia."
3,Lacks necessary grip,"BBC Music Magazine recordings are typically live performance gems from the BBC archive - with many being quite outstanding (e.g., Mackerras' Mahler Symphony No. 6). This recording of Bruckner's Fourth Symphony, unfortunately, isn't one of them. Marin offers a leisurely-paced performance that quite simply lacks the grip and blazing brass glory of Jochum's famous account with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra."
4,See You In September,"I didn't really know much about any of the actors or actresses in this movie other than Estella Warren. So I was very excited when it turned out to be a very good romantic comedy. The movie, when it started, I wasn't sure where the plot was going with the whole therapy thing, but I really got into it once the group started opening up. I really liked the way it ended, with everyone getting back together to see the play of their therapy group. That was a very cute way to end it, and even though the couples were unusually matched, it just goes to show you that you never know where love Is going to find you. It could be in the park or in the store or even in the men's room. You just have to be open to love, and it will come to you."
5,Good Enough for a Movie,This is the second book that I have read about Richard O'Kane and his experiences in the Wahoo and Tang and waiting on two more books to arrive. I simply cannot get enough! Will someone please make a movie about him?
2,Richard O'Kane is a great hero,Richard O'Kane is a great hero! The writer often confuse the issue with all the other stories. The book size could have been reduced 1/2 - if writer would have been writing about Richard O'Kane and not everything else. This made the book boring.
2,American Hero,"Richard O'Kane, for his World War II efforts in submarines, was given America's highest honor, the Medal of Honor. It was men such as he, in the air, on the sea, and under the sea, that really epitomized what America stood for."
5,Great book about a heroic leader and crew,"This book provides a fascinating look into the sometimes ""wild west"" aspects of sub warfare in the Pacific. Much discretion was given to skippers and some excelled and some couldn't handle the pressure. This book, at times, digresses into numerous accounts of the exploits of other subs and their captains. In context it made sense and helped explain how the sub officers learned much from one another. The erratic and inferior torpedoes they had to rely on was one of the war's great disasters and inexcusable failures. I never expected the ending and having just read ""Unbroken"" before this book was rather disheartened though the true life heroics continued after the sub's activities ceased."
2,Nothing like the real thing.......,"This story is basically a rehash of Tang and O'Kanes exploits, with a few other boat's highlights thrown in to make it seem less so. I consider Dick O'Kanes own ""Clear the Bridge"" one of THE best stories ever put to paper on the submarine war in the Pacific. I have read that book three times and it still held my interest. ""The Bravest Man"" did not do so through three chapters. The author just scratches the surface of the real story of Tang, and I bought the book hoping to learn more. It did not deliver. The fact that I read the real thing three times says it all...."
4,How To Make A Frog,This is a fun book for beginning readers. They read with the book and learn how to make a frog. Simple and active.
1,Horrible sound quality,"This particular set from Hallmark (import) is possibly the poorest quality music ever put on CD/MP3. It was obviously recorded from a worn out vinyl record and has hiss, crackling, pops, dropouts. Avoid this and buy the 10 song Christmas Sing-Along version available from Columbia."
2,Where are the rest of the songs?,"I own this title on vinyl and it has several more songs than the CD! Why? I want all my Mitch Miller, not Miller Lite!"
4,Not the original Holiday album,"I grew up listening to Mitch Miller's Holiday. I still have the cassette, but wanted a cd version. I was disappointed that the cd version was missing some of the songs. I was looking forward to the song ""Must be Santa"" and it's not on the cd."
3,"Good, for what it is","Miller's records were some of the more lightweight of his era, and this one is no exception. But those who grew up on these may well find them a welcome time capsule to childhood memories. (Keep in mind that this album is devoted entirely to traditional carols. Those looking for Miller's renditions of more secular fare--""Frosty"", ""Rudolph"", ""The Twelve Days of Christmas""--are directed to the HOLIDAY SING-ALONG album, also available from Amazon.)"
4,Christmas Sing-Along WIth Mitch,"I loved this and was happy to finally find it in a CD, however I was upset that it didn't include the ""sheet music"" so you could sing-along like the albums did."
1,There must be two Mitch Millers!,This is not the children's sing along with Mitch that we had in the 70s/80s. Sorry that the original is aparently not available.
5,Fun!,"Hmmm.... I think my title IS my review! This album is unabashed fun. It makes you want to turn the stereo up loud, louder, loudest. I saw RCR perform at the Warptour in 1997 at RFK, Washington, DC. The temperature was over 100 and the humidity about the same, and the Revue was playing in a breezeless sports arena, still they did not fail to rock. I think that says a lot, if not everything about the band. It would have been easy for them to half-step through the heat, but they did not let their audience down."
2,"Good music, lousy lyrics","The music is great, the singer has a smooth voice, but these songs are just bad! Too many of them are just goofy. My least favorite of the recent revival of ""swing"" bands. Disappointing."
5,This is the best album of Mozart's Divertimenti,"When I first heard this album in a store, I loved it at once and bought it. The air the music creats is so warm, witty, happy, and hopeful. I enjoyed it so much, when I have depressed mood, this music is a healing lotion to me. And I appreciate the musician's gentle pace, it makes me a feeling that the musicians in this album really love the music, they played it through the love of art, not just doing a work. I wonder why it's so hard to find other version. Recently I found a different version of these Divertimenti in a full Mozart's works collections, but I don't like that, it's too hurried, it gives me a feeling that the musicians were bored with the music and wished to finished it as soon as possible. That's why I highly recommend this Naxos version."
4,Good Coverage,"This book covers the topic very well. It is clear and concise. Useful for anyone who wants an overview of risk management concepts. But if you are like me who understands better with lots of numbers and examples, this is not it."
4,Financial Models Using Simulation and Optimaization,"A good book to tell you methodical risk analysis in the area of fincance and marketing. If more interpretaions of analysis results written there, I would have rated it as ""5"" stars."
1,Disappointed!!,"I wanted a good jazzersize workout with some old familiar tunes but made a mistake getting this VHS because it didn't work on my player. Unfortunately, I didn't have a chance to try it for a few months for some physical reasons & when I did, it was disappointing. I should have known better than to buy a VHS!! I didn't feel it was Amazon's fault I made a bad choice."
1,Very poor quality,"Save your money and buy something that is better quality and will last. These things are not sharp and they rust, rust, rust. If I had not used them, I would be sending the junk back."
3,Bent on first use,"I looked for the cheapest set of hedge shears I could find with free Prime shipping. The price was about the same as going to Sears, except I didn't have to drive which is a plus. The value was fine, but I couldn't cut ANYTHING over half an inch in diameter without these bending. Throughout my project they continued to bend. I imagine they will last the rest of the Spring and need replacement next year."
5,A gem from Naxos,"The production on this album is stunning. It really does sound like the trio is sitting in the room right inf front of you. The trio that makes up the bulk of this disk is one of my favorite pieces of chamber music. Schubert is not afraid to write tunes that you will be humming along afterwards and yet they never feel lightweight. If you have not heard this piece, I highly recommend you take that ... risk and order this CD. Naxos' motto is ""The Label of Discovery"", and I was very pleased with this one."
5,Does a great job of moisturizing dry hair,"My hair and skin have become very dry as a side effect of my high blood pressure medicine. The entire line of Nioxin products, although expensive, have worked well for me to thicken my slightly thinning hair and moisturize my naturally curly hair so it doesn't frizz as much. I use this intensive moisturizer every couple of weeks."
3,Disappointment,"Nioxin normally produces excellent products, but in this case, the Nioxin Intensive Therapy Deep Repair Masque did not meet my expectations for excellent conditioning qualities. The masque only softens hair and detangles, but doesn't add the body that I need in a repair masque. For the price of this product, it does not deliver!"
1,Crooks,- Item described as new came in without the seal wrap. Item appeared to be used and smells as if it was very very old.
2,Its not for nomal or dry skin.,This is for people that has oily skin only! This producft dries up your skin only recommanded to be used once a month.
2,It gets 2 stars only because it is a scholarly work.,This was the most worthless rot I ever read.... This book somehow loses something when translated from French to English. Marc Bloch made a feeble attempt to engage in true historical criticism.
4,Reflections by a great Historian,"This book of reflections by a master historian (and victim of the Nazis, which cut short his illustrious career), is not of the same order magnitude of a philosopher-historian like R. G. Collingwood (who made use of Bloch's work on France in the medieval period), but it contains many insights and historical remarks that make it interesting and informative.I have read and enjoyed this book for years and think you will find it well worth reading and re-reading. The following famous lines from the book illustrate the zest and love he has for the subject:""The good historian is like the giant of the fairy tale. He knows that wherever he catches the scent of human flesh, there his quarry lies.""I have it in French, and the English translation, and highly recommend it."
5,Industrialized fiction that sets the standard,"Dark and brooding stories of people, and their fractured lives. Playing out under the soft glow of television static while rotting cabling ensnares them, drawing them closer together into the undercurrent of forbidden subcultures. Wildly descriptive, the harsh environments mold the characters, creating new patterns of survival, and explorations of self destruction. Wielding a dark edge that most genre work strives for, these stories provide that glimpse down the dark alley-ways that many authors quickly push the reader past.Highly suggested for anybody that wants to explore the ghettos of the brightly lit cyberpunk fiction that is all too common"
2,"Lots of descriptive prose, little real narrative...","This is less a collection of stories than it is a collection of dark descriptions of a rusting, claustrophobic borg future that gets repetitive after three stories or so. Most are written from first-person perspective, with paragraph after paragraph of scene-setting descriptive prose, 90% of which contains some kind of metal, rust, fluid, or combination thereof. It wears thin quickly.Story-wise, there's very little ""meat"" under the surface, and practically zero in the way of any character interaction or dialogue. The final story shows some promise, though. With a good, stern editor and a collaborator to supply a plot, I think Logan's capable of writing a fine book. But this collection is only so-so."
2,Kindle version,"I purchased the kindle version and wanted to read it on my ipad with the kindle app. I found that there were images missing, and typos as well. I got to the 2nd chapter and decided to request a full refund. Amazon/publisher please give it a full review before release the ebook!"
5,Lived Up To It's Reputation,"No matter where I went, no matter who I talked to (about Chinese Medicine, of course), somewhere in the course of the conversation, the name of this book would pop up. I finally decided to purchase and read it.I was not disappointed.It isn't perfect - nothing is - but it is certainly one of the best introductions to Chinese Medicine around, especially for the westerner. The first few chapters in particular are a godsend for those unfamiliar with the Chinese way of thought. It explains the differences between western and easter scientific understanding without necessarily saying one is better than the other. I will be using many of his statements in my lectures to western medical students and doctors.Bravo."
5,Still the One,"This book is still, in my opinion, the best and most accurate introduction to standard Chinese medicine on the market. Often imitatated, nver duplicated. There's a reason it's been in print since 1982."
2,hard to get into!,"This book is required text as a student for me in my first year. I am now in my 3rd year and still can not get into this book! I find it very ""heavy"" to read and find after 2 -4 pages iv put it down and walked away. On the other hand I can say that out of the 30 students who read this book 1/2 loved it a rave about it all the time! The other 1/2 have not read it, cant get into it at all or find they already know why they want to study TCM and are learning all about it and dont need a reminder! I have had people ask me what is TCM, and how did it come about etc and I have not recomended them read this book if they have no understanding of TCM at all. Its to hard and to grasp the conceps with they way this book is set out and the use of the wording is to complex.I hope to one day read it, as i spent enough $$ on it! But at this stage its like walking through wet cement for me!"
2,Good general info on TCM but for those who really study it not that accurate,"For a lay person this is a good book, for those who study TCM not so much. Some facts are innacurate / simplified. My Uni told us not to read this book. There are more comprehensive books in English on the market for those who are studying TCM."
2,Ugh,"This was recommended to me to learn more about Chinese medicine (of course). It has great reviews, but, I'm sorry---there is so much in this book, it's much more of a textbook-read than what I thought I was getting/being recommended. I had to take notes to get through the first chapter or two...and then I put it down. Too much work for what my end goal was."
2,Very Complicated,Not a bad book at all if you're looking for a VERY in depth college course on the subject of Chinese Medicine. It needs a teacher to explain it. Even my own Chinese Medical Doctor told me it was one of her more difficult books to get thru during her training. There are easier books to study if you're a novice like me. It's essential if you're going into the full practice.
1,too cerebral,This is written with a clinicians brain and viewpoint. Fine for a dry text book. I could not cut through this very cerebral text.
5,Excellent!,"Very clear, yet it does not over simplify it. If you are new to Chinese Medicine or want to deepen your understanding, this book is the way to go."
5,The 3AM Epiphany is different,"The 3 AM Epiphany stands out from other writing guides. It has a respect for the reader and an insight into writing I haven't experienced before, and it actually inspired me. It's readable, engaging, and interesting; the writing that it intends to educe is of a more literary quality; and the organization and structure of the book and the prompts encourages exploration and assumes the reader is capable. It really impressed me, and it really helped me. More than any other writing guide I've bought, borrowed, read, perused, etc., this is the book that reminded writing is something I can do, something I like to do, and in the end, resulted in writing being something that I actually do on a regular basis."
3,challenging writing olympics for the accomplished writer,"This book is a bit overwhelming for the newbie writer who is just trying to get started. Unless you can dash off a large quantity of high-quality words on an assigned sophisticated topic at the drop of a hat, it's only a interesting read of the build- up to the excercises. A bit on the scholarly side (as in literary writing). If that is what you're looking for, by all means."
3,"good, not great","After you've read five or six of these kinds of books, the exercises all seem the same. There are some good exercises in here, but nothing earth-shattering. A good reference book for teachers, but for the writer looking for something new to add to a collection of books of writing exercises, you might not be impressed."
4,Great Book!,"The 3 A.M. Epiphany is a wonderful book. I got it for my 18th Birthday and was very pleased. At the beginning of every section is a sort introduction to the topic that is being covered, and after this the author moves right into the exercises. A few of the exercises can prove to be rather challenging, but this is what makes them worth while. This is not a book of prompts, it is a book of exercises.The exercises really do help improve your work and there is only reason I'm not giving it five stars. The reason is because it wasn't AMAZING and made me want to tell everyone about it. Still, a very useful book to keep around. Lots of interesting ideas."
4,"Form, and Function","Not only did I find the writing excercises interesting, entertaining, and refreshing, I thought the physical book itself was beautifully put together. I like the author's approach to writing: you learn writing by doing it, and by stretching your limits as a writer.Also, I took this on vacation with me and found it to be not only informative for writing purposes, but entertaining for beach-lounging as well."
4,Know Which CD You are Ordering!!!,These are good cds of the LDS hymns...it is a set of multiple cds with 2 cds per case. On Amazon they are being sold by individual cases...but they are not labeled by which cds are included...so check with the seller before ordering to be sure which cds you are actually paying for. The set as a whole includes every song in the 1985 hymn book (the one currently used).
5,"looking for s. holl, you found ""it""","simply what architects look for, great pictures, simple but complete explanations, and drawings. if you like steven holl, or you just need to have an idea of who he is and what's his work, this book is just what you were looking for."
3,This book was OK but nothing special...,"I liked this book but there wasn't enough personality. Karissa was a ""spitfire"" which really stood out but other then that there wasn't much to them. I only laughed once (if that) in this book. Everything was very predictable. If you are looking for a ""steamy"" romance this is not the right book. Overall it's a good read but I think it just needed a little more personality, romance & mystery."
3,Good toy for travel,"I bought this for my 20 month old son for his first trip out of state to visit grandma. He played with it a little bit because grandma did not have many toys. Since we've been home, he has not played with it at all. It is very cute, but it just didn't hold his interest."
1,"Cute, but my kids never really played with it","I got this for my twins when they were about 18 months old, to use as a car toy. I really liked the charming, bright design, and it seemed like something that my occupy my kids in their carseats. Nearly a year and many miles later, they've never really played with it. The six pieces drop all too easily with the floor, and they're so small that it's difficult for a toddler to do the activity in question -- they can't, for example, hold the little square AND zip or unzip the alligator zipper. Pass on this, and get something like the Doodle Pro or some kind of pop-up toy."
5,EuroGrocer Top Recommendation,"My husband and I live in China and was in Rome recently for a holiday. We were introduced to Garganelli Pasta there which we were told is specially made in a region just outside of Rome. Needless to say we stocked up but soon run out after a few months. We have tried looking everywhere for it in Hong Kong and China with no luck. By chance decide to try Amazon, and found EuroGrocer. We could not believe our luck! And better yet, as it turns out they went out of their way to redirect the package at my request after it had already been picked up by DHL. And kept me informed of the progress. I trully appreciate good service and this is a shinning example. With staff like Ellen, I definitely rate them a 5 star."
4,Fun and Entertaining!,"Ignore the critics and naysayers - Most of them wouldn't know entertainment unless it exploded in front of their face - Also, people (especially young people don't read the classics anymore - I say this and I'm only 33) - One of the best things about this movie is the use of the literary characters (Love the casting) - I've never read the comic, so I had not been influenced by it upon watching this movie - However, I have read most of the novels these characters were based upon - Fantastic to see them brought to life on the big screen! - dark, somber - perfect mood for this time in history - but i can see why this movie didn't go down well - not enough dumb action, useless bloodshed, stupid jokes, and whiny characters for the masses"
5,It's Great,It is great. My kids really liked is also. We actually watched it twice. I do plan on putting this movie in our collection of adventure movies.
3,An ok movie with unreal effects,The movie its self wasn't to bad but it did lose me very once in a while because of the unnessicary chatter. It had some ok effects but some were very over done. For example the Natualist in the cannel to much for me.
1,Lots of things blow up and that's about it,"This movie is as random as it gets. The characters dislike each other for no reason I can understand, they travel to different places but I don't know why, and a LOT of stuff explodes. The filmmakers added Tom Sawyer and Dorian Gray to the original League, but why? The villain isn't interesting, either --- that's a real problem in a superhero action movie.In addition to melodramatic acting, a slurring Sean Connery, and a senseless ""plot,"" the special effects are horrible. Although I did like Mr. Hyde, everything else was flat and lifeless. They made Hyde look smelly and sweaty, but everything else looks like a cartoon. Fortunately, I rented this one for two bucks. Avoid it."
4,Great Story and good actors,Being a fan of comic books and comic book movies I just had to see The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and I was impressed. For die hard fans it may be a dispoint but really no movie is ever going to be just like the comic book. I enjoyed the charators and thought they got the right actors for the job. The plot is great and full of interesting twists. I'm not telling what happens but if your looking for a good time this is the movie. A must see of the big screen movie. My only complaint is there was a little to much CG in it but that was it. 4 stars
1,It could have been good.,"This could have been a good movie. Too bad it wasnt!I love the comic, but the movie had only three good points.1) cool machines2) big explosions3) hot guysIT IS SOOOOOOOO SAD!!sean could have been a benifit, but alas, he wasnt. This is the only movie that he has been in ,that i have seen him in, that was unbearibly bad. I was in pain watching this movie!! The best scene was when Mia faught Dorian grey, that was cool. : )"
2,"I agree...""Its a MESS!""",This is just now worth buying...not to mention watching. I think they could have done a better job in making it...but it just went everywhere...A MESS!!
2,what would Alan Moore say?,"This movie reminded me of the adaptation of Starship Troopers - the title was the same but everyhting else was completely different. If you are a fan of the excellent graphic novels by Moore and Kevin O'Neil you will be bitterly disappointed in this film.Taken on its own, the film isn't all that bad. It's pure B Movie fun and Sean Connery and the cast (Stuart Townsend as well) have a terrific time with their characters. I was disappointed by Hyde - how does a ghastly creature who murders people in the Rue Morgue and is the embodiment of pure evil suddenly decide to be helpful and a team player? He also looks amazingly fake.The plot is silly and exists only for fight scenes and the Fantom is a terrible movie villian (how does he get around in all that armor?) but I always like lots of kung fu and flips so it was fun to watch.I agree with another reviewer - the ending is lame. Rent but don't buy."
1,A waste of time. One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"This movie looked great from the previews. When i started watching it I was not impressed. Sean Connery is the only good actor in this movie. I thought oh another great Sean Connery movie. I was wrong. This is a piece of garbage. The plot is way to predictable. The special effects are just mediocre. It reminded me of Indiana Jones except way too fictional and not nearly as good of acting or special effects. Whoever wrote the story for this movie just took ideas from Dracula, Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde, and whole bunch of other stories and tried to put them togeather and made the worst movie of all time. A good piece of advice to whoever wrote this, you should really write something original since you can't tell stories right. The ending was so stupid and predictable i was laughing by the end of the movie that Sean Connery would even act in this piece of garbage."
1,No Wonder Allan Moore Hates Hollywood,"This is one of THOSE movies...If you are familiar with the source material,then you're going to be severely let down by the way they took such a marvelous title and turned it into this silly overdone(yet inexplicably drab)piece of film.If you're not familiar with the source material and were just hoping for a fun and exciting action-packed extravaganza,you're still barking up the wrong tree.It's a good concept...a group of famous fictional characters from literature (Allan Quartermain,Dr. Jeckle and Hyde,Dorian Grey,etc.)brought together to fight the good fight around the turn of the 20th century.The premise?Fantastic.The finished product?Poorly executed,making it a movie not worth watching.Honestly."
3,a guilty pleasure that I adore,"Yes I know that LXG is ""bad"". I've heard that before, but here's the thing that counts: LXG entertained me. LXG is fun. It's a comic book movie with a ""B movie"" vibe and a damn fine one at that. It also has class. The characters from classic novels that I adored as a child are brought to life by an enjoyable cast that includes Sean Connery, Naseeruddin Shah, Peta Wilson, Stuart Townsend, and the devilish Richard Roxburgh. LXG puts together many of my favorite fictional characters and has them battle an evil masked madman and his army for the fate of the world. How can I not love that? It's this avid reader's childhood dream come true. Worst movie ever? No way! LXG is a guilty pleasure, and those are often the best kind. 3.5 stars."
1,Is this a cartoon....?,"Half of a city is bombed to rubble, but Connery and his sidekicks escape without a scratch. They use swords and furniture as weapons to defeat men armed with fully automatic guns. Mr Hyde has the ability to become a Hulk like muscular monster.Plus many more ""extraordinary""(illogical) scenes.Don't be fooled by the strong ads relating this to the movie Blade. There is absolutely no comparison between the 2 movies."
1,Difficult to watch,"Unequivocally, the worst film I have seen in years. Although the historical inaccuracies, overblown special effects, ridiculous plot and stilted dialogue are painful, these failings never quite demonstrate the total disregard for the audience evidenced by the horrendous acting. One is speechless from the first frame and continues to watch only on the theory that the film could not get worse. One will be sorely mistaken as every passing minute brings greater agony. Clearly, this movie was never designed to be publicly viewed and was perhaps intended to be used in an introductory film course as a ""what not to do"" demonstration."
1,Couldn't make it all the way....,"This movie was so bad we only lasted about 30 minutes before turning it off. Very disappointing! The story is laughable, & not much of anything really happens. Minimal action, non-sensical plot, poorly defined characters, no drama, no suspense, & while it should have been at least a little campy, there was no humor to be had at all."
1,Disappointing Waste / Effects Do Not Make a Story,"An extremely impressive group of 19th century literary figures are completely wasted in this moronic big budget film. Special effects are GREAT but the effects are the only good things in this dumb and uninteresting tale. Mr. Hyde should not be portrayeed as the Hulk; Moriarity and Nemo were men of genius, not marshal arts fighters; there was no story worth telling so it was just a beautiful big budget film of no consequence. Too dumb to even be fun. I have seen and loved every Sean Connery film ever made for 45 years. This is a loser."
1,Joins My Worst Movie Club,"I saw this at the theatre and it joins my worst movie club with the likes of Congo, She-Devil and Dumb and Dumber."
2,The League Of Extra-Ordinary Gibberish!,"Disappointing. Disjointed. Disastrous. Dis sucks! This is basically something cooked up by someone too lazy to think up original characters, along the lines of ""Van Helsing"", or into doing remakes. I can't imagine Sean Connery needed the money all that badly, but if I was him, I'd ask them to take my name off of it."
2,Dud...,"Though the premise promises some bang, what you get is a basic dud! With that said, there are a few over the top moments that are quite fun and make this a B-Movie popcorn fest..."
3,Not that BAD,"There are a lot of disappointed fans of the comic out there, but you know this movie isn't that bad. Sure there was a lot of potential there, but as a simple 2 hour diversion it fits the bill. My advice is rent it, enjoy it, and then buy it as a PV DVD"
4,Indiana Jones meets the X-Men,"A cross between Indiana Jones & X-Men.Spectacular visuals, great fight scenes, plenty of action, very cool. Looking forward to more from this series."
5,Best movie of the summer,"I had never heard of The League until information about the movie came out. Based on what I read, I was intrigued. As a fan of many of the literary characters shown in the movie I wanted to see how they had evolved. I was not disappointed. This movie brings together a collection of classical tragic hero and gives them a mission. If you don't recognize some of the names, then look at 20000 Leagues Under the Sea, Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde, the original Dracula story, the invisible man, The Painting of Dorian Gray, and of course the Alan Quartermain stories. It takes place at the end of the 19th century so there is still some of the innocence of a world that hasn't faced world wars. The last time I felt this excited watching a movie was when I watched Raiders of the Lost Ark. I'll definately be getting the DVD when its out. Until then, you have to see this movie."
5,The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,This movie has action adventure and imagination. The story moves right along most of the time telling you just enough about different characters to make you like them but not dragging it out.
2,Disappointing flick that Connery can't save,"This is an interesting movie, it is appallingly bad in every way... except for Sean Connery. He is almost, but not quite, able to save the film simply by showing up and being That Damn Cool. Now, I've enjoyed other films with Connery before, but here we have the wierd spectacle of seeing him at his most fun to watch this side of ""Goldfinger,"" only to have everything around him be a complete train wreck and waste of time. Still, fat old bald men simply should NOT be able to kick that much ass.But sadly, I have to remind you that this movie really *is* a big stinker: bad story, obvious plot ""twists,"" really bad CGI, dismal acting, pretty much you name it. And for those few who read the comic book version of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, prepare yourself to see about 100 IQ points chopped off the top of the story, and all the good characters butchered or replaced."
5,An awesome collection of 19th Century Stories,"The best movie of the YEAR!! The people who said that it was bad must have been lieing. This movie has Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde{The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson} Captain Nemo[ 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne]the Nautilus is AMAZING!!, Rodney Skinner[ HG Well's The Invisible Man (name was changed from Hawley Griffin do to rights issues]Dorian Gray[The Picture of Dorian Grey by Oscar Wilde] Alan Quartermain, Mina Harker[ Bram Stoker's Dracula, the same girl plays Mina in the Upcoming movie Van Helsing] Tom Sawyer[ The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain] Watch this movie. It is so awesome. If you liked this go see Van Helsing"
5,cheesy!!!,"I gotta admit I liked LXG a lot! Yeah it ain't true to Alan Moore's grapic ""novel"" (sure looked like a comic book to me), but Moore wasn't true to the characters either so WHO CARES? This is fun. Get some friends and watch it with em and stop acting so ""cultured""."
3,I think this is a pretty good movie,"Lots of people didn't like this film, but when I got to see it on DVD I liked it a lot. Okay, so it's not a really great film, but the effects are fun and the action is often super cool. Good actors, too. Sean Connery, of course, is always THE MAN! I liked the girl who played the vampire woman as well. Captain Nemo was cool with his kung-fu moves. I thought that Mr. Hyde was waaaaay too much like the Hulk (but that's a film I didn't like so its okay). I haven't read the comic books, but I'll bet they're pretty cool too.There's some extra stuff here on the DVD, but they were kinda boring, so don't buy this if you want a lot of extra stuff. Buy it if you like lots of action and neat sets and think Sean Connery is cool, even if he's pretty old now."
2,Nothing Extraordinary About This Movie,"Having just watched the League of Extraordinary Gentleman, I came away feeling dissatisfied. Don't you just hate it while watching a movie and this single thought keeps going through your head, ""They could have made it so much better."" This film is so unbelivable that it borders on the absurd. The plot, what little there is, is nonsense, the characters are pointless, and the special affects are nothing special. The only thing that keeps me from rating this film one star is the acting. This is one movie Sean Connery is going to regret making. Save yourself some money and wait to watch this one on cable."
3,Entertaining...to a point,"Now a days, people have come to expect alot from a movie based off a popular comic book. ""LXG"" is a letdown. While it does have its share of very well done action sequences its will leave some people frowning. Loyal fans of the comic will want to approach with extreme caution."
3,Most of it didn't make any sense,"I only gave it 3 stars because most of the movie didn't make sense. It started off great, but as it went along it really didn't make sense. There were parts of the movie that didn't belong. I am seven years late watching this movie. I thought this would be a blockbuster (especially with Sean Connery in it), but I was disappointed. This movie only grossed over $100,000,000 worldwide, so yea, it wasn't that great."
1,Not a good film.,"Here's the premise. Let's take as many late Victorian science fiction and fantasy characters as we can and put them together into an action movie. This seems like it would be really cool. The writers throw in a few half-clever references to the original works here and there, but characters mostly get to their supernatural powers. Character development is minimal since we've got to fit 6 or 7 characters into a regular-length movie plus lots of fighting and explosions.The comic may be good, but don't waste your time on the movie."
1,A Sean Connery movie?,I have say that this is one of the worse Sean Connery movie that I have ever watch.
5,Great cast and a great movie.,I waited months for this to be released as a DVD as I missed it at the cinema and I wasn't disappointed.This is a fast-paced movie and it helps if you have read the stories of the characters before you watch it.Sean Connery is excellent in his role as Alan and I must admit I loved the character of Skinner as he lightened the whole atmosphere of the film. I also loved Dorian as I was fascinated by the character as a child.A great movie I thought. If you loved Indiana Jones and Daredevil than this is the movie for you.
3,goofy but I liked it,"I wasn't expecting anything but a fun time with Captain Nemo, Mr Hyde, the Invisible Man, and company. Mina is stunning! I got what I expected and was pleasantly surprised by some of the rest of it.A goofy good time."
4,unique and weird- I liked it very much,Watch this one for yourself and see what you think. It's much much better then as I heard it was. It's mixes the thrills of classic movie serials with great literary characters and has superb performances from a perfect cast. It's got a unique vibe to it. I like it.
3,Popcorn fun,"If your gonna watch this for intellectual reasons, then you have picked the wrong movie. Shut your brain off and just enjoy the action, the characters and the special effects. Grab some popcorn and have fun."
4,A Literary Dream Team,"This was such a great concept. Finding out that it was originally a comic book really wasn't that surprising considering the story line that this movie follows. Lots of action and some of the most magnetic characters from literature. That is what got me really interested in the movie. The writers picked the most interesting combination of characters to form this league and it was wonderful to see them all brought to life and working together. If you enjoyed reading these characters, you'll like the movie. If you have never heard of these characters, you'll like the movie because it does give you some background to where these characters came from."
2,ITS NOT THAT BAD REALLY!,"Not another comic book film? Continuing the current trend of turning graphic novels to film, LXG sees a collection of classic misfits such as The Invisible Man & Dr. Jekyll form a late 19th Century X-Men-styled unit.A league of extraordinary gentlemen you might say? Yup!So what happens? Like most groups formed by such men, crime & evil doesn't tend to stand a chance & while the plot is predictable Director Stephen Norrington (Blade) beefs up the action with style and a punch or two to the gut. Supported by an able cast, it is Sean Connery as the legendary Quartermain however who steals the show with an onscreen awe that captures the other character's hearts as much any audience's.The Verdict: Let down by special effects that are surpassed by the polish of today's car adverts there is still an undeniable charm to this yarn that sets the bar for Saturday Morning films to come"
4,Surprisingly...decent *Spoilers*,"3.5 stars. For me the movie didn't really start to be fun until after the Venice thingy. I didn't quite understand what that whole thing was about and then sighed with relief when that plot line turned out to be a ruse. I thought there was an interesting assembly of characters set in a Victorian age and I agree Dorian Gray stood out in his performance. I can't quite put my finger on what this film is missing, but I do know that it's missing something. Maybe a better explantion of bringing this assembly of people together in the first place when they, quite frankly, didn't have you in their radar to begin with. Couldn't he go about gathering what he needed from them without all this elaborate drama? Overall, this is an entertaining film and not at all as bad as I feared."
4,"Pretty Good, But A Bit Too Long","The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was based on a pretty good graphic novel and as a movie, its pretty good itself. Where else could you ever hope to see the likes of Captain Nemo, Dorin Gray, Mina Harker, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jeckyl/Mr. Hyde, Allan Quatermain & Tom Sawyer all in the same movie? About the only character the production is lacking is Sherlock Holmes.The action and special effects in this movie are outstanding as are the performances from most of the actors. The only real drawback is the length. About 30 minutes could be excised from this movie without deleting any key scenes.All in all, a good popcorn flick."
3,"Based on a Good Story, but Film is Not Extraordinary","The story of a team made up of fictional characters from different stories - Captain Nemo, Mrs. Mina Harker, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dorian Gray, Invisible Man, and so on who are called to save the world is a good premise. It got me to see the movie, but the movie fell short of expectations because of an unbelievable plot twist and a disappointing ending. It was such that a good pre-screening of the film to an audience about the ending may have saved this film from being a so-so film and elevate it to one of the more memorable action films of the decade. But because I love the original characters from the classic books they have sprung to life from, the movie is fun enough to see if you put aside any thread of criticism."
4,I HAD A LOT OF FUN,"For entertainment purposes, I found LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN to be a great roller coaster ride, filled with some awesome CGI effects, derring do and villainous confrontations. Peta Wilson as Mina Harker was my favorite; Shane West as Tom Sawyer was fun; Jason Flemyng's Jekyll/Hyde goofily exciting; and of course, Sean Connery leading the way as he always so gallantly does. Trevor Jones' score was brilliant, too. It's mindless, confusing at times, but as far as ""comic book"" adventures go, it's a great way to spend a couple hours. Don't take it so seriously and I think you'll find it enjoyable too. Richard Roxburgh as M is excellent too! Stephen Norrington's direction is right on target.I recommend it heartily."
3,It's good but could be better,"hi there...reading the reviews, i found myself surprised that some people did not even read the comic book. first of all, the comic is way much better than it's film cousin, but the comic couldn't work as a movie so the liberties taken were cool. second, if you read the comic, you will get why the name of their boss is M (and no, it's not because sean connery was james bond), and why is called the league. anyways, dorian gray is not in the comic book, but it's a nice addition and stuart townsend acted brilliantly in it's role. go see it yourself but fist read the comic first, you will be a lot more entertained and more satisfied."
2,Just not good.,"I'm a huge Sean Connery fan and so I really wanted to like LXG, but it just bored me to tears. There's a lot of action but I wasn't ever able to get involved in the story because the characters were never really fleshed out. Add to that an entirely predictable plot twist and you've got Connery's worst film since Highlander II. And you know what I'm talkin' about. The planet Zeist."
4,live action old school justice league,"LXG is an entertaining combo of literary good guys vs literary bad guys, comic book heroics, and CGI. It's a fun Saturday matinee type of adventure/fantasy movie. It's the Justice League of the 19th century. I LIKED IT!!"
4,extraordinarily entertaining,"well the fx are great and the characters are great and there's plenty of great action. i love steam punk too and this is a steam punk movie. the cast is great too: connery, wilson, townsend, and roxburgh were my faves but naseeruddin shah was the most impressive. i never heard of that guy before but he kicks major a$$! see lxg!"
4,Pretty Good,"A good movie that is a refreshing change, that is reintroducing 19th century characters as heros instead of current 20th century comic book fare such as Daredevil, Hulk (which were flops). Let's face it, the old Scotsman still has it too."
3,It was an ok movie.,A decent enough try at turning a comic book into a movie. But let's face it folks. It's not easy to do. They tried and didn't quite pull it off. I have never read the comic book but I still enjoyed the movie. Could they have developed the characters more? Of course? Could they have taken out the pointless car scene ( much like Lucas could have taken out the pointless pod racing scene from Phantom Menace)? Oh heck yeah!A great concept that could have been done better. Still. I would classify it as a gamers movie based on the ideas and adventure hooks presented there in.Chip DobbsVisionary Entertainment Studio Inc.www.visionaryentertainment.com
2,Tried but FAILED.....,This movie had such good potential but fails miserably. The characters are hollow and a bit over-acted. Certain scenes are shot well but lack substance. The supposed intrigue just isn't there. I say pass on this movie.
3,Mediocre,"The movie is pretty mediocre, but entertaining. Better than van Helsing. If you compare the movie to the characters out of the books which it depicts you'll probably be disapointed, so take it for what it is. A movie that drives to entertain the masses, not to satisfy the bookworms [no offense to anybody here. I happen to be one also]"
3,"As good as could be expected, I guess","I went to see this movie when it was in theaters. Now, to be fair, I wasn't expecting anything particularly brilliant. Even so, I had hoped that the film would have fun with its plot. There WAS a plot, believe it or not, but it was merely pulled from the sea of silly CG effects from time to time in a weak attempt to remind us it was there. About halfway through the movie, it was obvious how it would end and what sappy device would be used to bring it about. The only other real problem with the movie was that there was too much crammed into it, there were several characters that could have been explored more. Sadly, the film dwelt the longest on the least interesting. I still don't know what the hell Tom Sawyer was doing in it anyway."
3,"Not bad, but far from being extraordinary",A group of characters taken from classic novels band together to from a covert team of super heroes. Not exactly true to the comic book but still a watchable piece of entertainment where the plot and what made the comic popular is ditched for big explosions and some damn fine action scenes. It's not X-Men but its hell of a lot better than some other comic book films.
2,"Could have been great, should have been great, but it wasn't","The idea of for the LXG movie was a great one. The wittiness and cleverness of having a team of classic literary characters seems very fun, and this movie could have started a great franchise. With some of the worst directing and a terribly written screenplay, however, this film fails to astonish, in fact it fails to even slightly entertain after the first 20 minutes.One of the problems, is that their is always something action-packed happeneing at every moment. This causes for boredom, for if your adrenaline is going every second, eventually it is ineffective. Their is no down time in the movie for the viewer to process the information. This cause the viewing of LXG seem like it is work. Most of the acting is pretty well-done, but the director, who should never be let near a video-camera again, had no idea what he was doing.Trust me, this movie is not worth watching."
1,The League of Extrordinary Gentlemen,Wait till it's shown on your local TV station on a night when you have other plans for the evening.
4,If You Know Nothing About the Comic ... You'll Love It,"I LOVED this movie. It had lots of action and the special effects were really good, especially the changing of Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde. It appears to me that the only people that don't like the movie are those people constantly comparing it to some comic book. If you haven't seen the comic book and are looking for a good action movie with the ever charismatic Professor Sean, this is the DVD for you. Four Thumbs Up!!"
1,shame on sean connery,A class B movie at best. the only reason i bought this dvd was sean was starring and the concept seemed exciting. what a dissapointment!! save your money!!!
1,And the point was?,"After just seeing ""The league of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" I can understand why it got such bad reviews. The only good thing that I could say about the movie was Sean Connery was in it and he was the only good actor. The rest of the movie was just plan bad. The one thing that I couldn't understand was Mina Harker was a vampire and everyone know that vampires do not survive in sunlight. This is one movie that watcher should just pass on!"
1,"By far the worst movie I've seen, yet","This movie makes absolutly no sense. It is 110 minutes of dis-jointed scenes punctuated by random explosions and CGI effects. The only good thing I can say is the fact that the video transfer and the sound is excellent, unfortunatley you could watch the whole film without any sound and you wouldn't miss anything."
3,Guilty Pleasure,"I can't really give you a good reason why I like this movie.... but I do. There's plenty of bad dialogue, bad acting and bad plot divices... but if you are willing to be forgiving it can still be fun. The action is good enough, and the big submarine is kind of cool. I do wish wish the flavor of the comic book had been preserved a little better. This movie tries to glorify the main characters a little too much, whereas the original League was more sinister than heroic. But hey... sit back, eat your popcron, turn your brain off for a spell and let the good time roll!"
2,Might be good for kids...,"This movie is about a group of literary characters who form a group and fight together against evil. I had a lot of problems paying attention to this movie. It just didn't grab my attention and my mind kept wondering. I felt like the characters were just running around and didn't really know what they were doing. That being said, I think that children (not too young due to violence) may enjoy watching this film due to the costumes, special effects, etc."
2,Sorry Guys...,"This movie was a BIG letdown. I begged my parents to let me see it. I thought it was going to be one of those awesome can-I-please-watch-it-again movies. Nuh uh. I dunno, it just was cheesey in some places and just flat out dumb. Not to mention unrealistic. I know its a fantasy story but come on! There's no way Tom Sawyer, having never seen a car in his life, could just get in and cruise Venice, saving the world like he's a pro! It just didn't seem right. The Fantom was not a good villain, he looked and sounded fake and made you want to laugh. It was waaaayy too long (and that's saying something, since I'm a Lord of the Rings fan) and the dialog stunk. I feel sorry for Sean Connery. He's an awesome actor, but I don't know what he was thinking, agreeing to this!"
4,Extreme living at its best,"This film is an antidote to our clockwork orange world. It brings to life the collective works of writers who genuinely understood the extremes of human mind and humankind.This work, focuses its energy on character rather than non-stop gratuitious excitement. If your enjoyment is derived from having your senses continuously assualted, this may not be the right film for you. However, if you know something of the characters and their internal turmoil, you will completely enjoy this work.This is a nice film, suitable for family veiwing. While it has its terrifying moments, they last only so long as is required to impart the needed effect.A knowledge of the original stories from which these characters are derived is not essential. However knowing something of the stories will deepen the meaning of this film for you.At a time when so many pretend ""extreme"" living, we have here a work that imparts the truth of extreme life.Enjoy!"
2,Get rid of that stupid American...,"Could no one responsible for this project see that this Shane West person has no business being anywhere near this film? I was fully prepared to while away a few hours with this piece of fluff, not expecting anyway particularly extraordinary, but at least have some fun watching Sean Connery do his thing. Then, 15 minutes into the film, we get this Shane West - he opens his mouth - and the movie is history for me. Bone-headed producers who feel that we Americans are so stupid that we can't enjoy a movie unless it has some moronic 15-year old cowboy in it. Did no one at the studio watch this and not figure it out? I have to admit I never did finish the film. If they had to have an American, did they have to get someone who registers like a block of unvarnished wood?"
2,Save Your Money,"I really liked the premise, and the previews were spectacular. Unfortunately, that's all this movie is. It's as if it was done to show someone who has never seen a movie what could be done with computer effects. Rent at most."
3,"Repeat after me, Books better than movies!",I was waiting for a long time to see this movie as I loved the comics and books when I was a kid. The movie was pretty neat in concept but after a while I was a bit bored with all the action esp. the whole thing in Mongolia. The movie did follow the book to a large extent except for some switches in characters and responsibilities. Worth a rent but not a buy...
3,Really Wanted to Like This One,"This movie appeared to have everything going for it: a unique idea with a literary background, a terrific cast, top-notch special effects.But it just doesn't work.The machine guns and car chase were distracting for 1899. Sean Connery always adds weight to any proceedings and Peta Wilson is sexy as a vampire. I loved the clash of literary characters like Dorian Gray, Jekyll & Hyde, the Invisible Man, etc. But I ended up wanting to like this movie more than I did.(I'd also heard that Connery has another miserable time making this film, clashing with the young director and such. So much so that Harrison Ford, when asked if Connery will return as his father in the next Indiana Jones film, tersely says, ""He's retired"").I'd like to see what the original graphic novels this was based on are like."
2,No funny aftertaste,"No aftertaste at all. I am sure I'll have forgotten this movie completely before I can even... Wait, what was I talking about again? Oh, yes. LXG. Sean Connery has become the dottering old guy they portray him as on SNL. The characters are given short shift to some of the saddest SFX I've ever seen. The Nautilus changes sizes from as vast as Manhattan to small enough to fit into a canal in Venice. The only semi-interesting characters are either dead by the end of the movie or defying their own story-lines for a ""funeral"" for another ""dead"" character. Yuck!"
5,One of hubby's favorite DVD's.,This was a movie that my husband has seen many times before. He wanted his own copy now that he finally got his big screen TV.
3,NOT FOR EVERYONE (INCLUDING ME),"The problem with people who could not get themselves to like this doozy film is that they were expecting it to be like the graphic novel that inspired it.The only attributes the film retains are the period, the plot summary (at a very simplified level) and the basic cast of characters. If you're expecting the characterization of the literary comic figures, well that isn't happening either.The best I can about this film is that I was not disappointed. There's plenty of action, a surprise bad guy, and some pretty spiffy special fx.Watch it as a no-expectations thriller with a twist and you'll do fine. Taken on its own merits, it's a decent way to while away an hour or two."
1,The League of Extraordinary Morons,"I just watched this movie, and I have to say I am in an extraordinary stupor. I feel like I have experienced something so extraordinarily bad, I don't know how to express it (ok, no more extraordinary references). This movie is bad. It is convoluted, has no focus, and the special effects were very disappointing except for Skinner and his whole white plaster thing going on. Sean Connery's line ""I'm waiting to be impressed"" sums up the whole experience. You sit there waiting for anything to happen that could possibly redeem the movie, and there is nothing. Avoid this movie if you can, but if you can't I hope you go with an extraordinarily special person so at least you can say you got something out of it...a date."
1,Idiotic,"Let's start from the beginning. The man's name is Allan QUATERmain. It is NOT QUARTERmain. And Sean Connery? He shtill talksh like he haszh a mouth full of oatmeal, and even HE mispronounces his own name!! And Quatermain (in Haggard's fiction) describes himself as small, a ""flea of a man"" whose hair ""stands up like a bristle brush"". He certainly isn't Sean Connery. Quatermain was born in 1817. This movie is set in 1911. You do the math. The cover photo is extremely reminiscent ofMystery Men, and even thought that flick has a villian named Casanova Frankenstein, it's STILL better than this mangled, ill-conceived adaptation. Why is Nemo's Nautilus the size of an aircraft carrier? And if it's that huge, how does it cruise around the canals of Venice? Tom Sawyer? Really?! No wonder Alan Moore is disgusted with films of his books.The rest lives up to this insulting premise. Strictly for dimbulbs that think they're ""smart"" because they've heard of some of the characters."
1,A complete waste of celluloid,"A complete waste of celluloid, even my 11 year old hated it. It could have been much better, but then you would have to make the characters interesting. A wandering plot, 1-dimensional characters with insipid dialog.dumb, dumb, dumb.And I like alot of B flicks....Did Sean Connery really need the money this badly? Lets take up a collection......"
3,So-so,"Great concept, poor execution. I loved the fact that it tried to create its heroes based on literary characters, but the writing was just off. The ending was also confusing. Was Dorian Grey dead? Did Quartermaine rise from the dead? The CG Mr. Hyde was also ridiculous, but I give high points to the Invisible Man and Dracula's bride."
4,A ROLLICKING ADVENTURE,"From gaslit London to the icey wastelands of Mongolia, a band of freaky anti-heroes pursue the mysterious ""M"", a criminal mastermind bent on world domination. With a well-known supporting cast, tongue-in-cheek humor, and a slew of computer generated special effects, this film will appeal to anyone between the ages of 12 and 65 (there are a few violent scenes that may be too intense for younger viewers). Keep in mind that this is escapist adventure, and nothing more. Very enjoyable."
3,pretty good,League is just a decent action/fantasy movie that provides a good amount of entertainment value. It's not the best film ever made and it's not the worst. I have a lot of affection for this movie. Good fun. B Movie fans will like it the most.
1,Action Fan,"I'm a guy who loves testosterone laden action flics. So much so that occasionally I'll forgive the lack of plot, character developement or even a film that makes little sense in lieu of some great eye candy or earsplitting booms and bangs.Unfortunately this film contained none of the above. I love Sean Connery. The rest of the cast was solid. The script, execution and acting was, plainly- not. Save yourself the trouble and disappointment.I almost fell asleep. Really."
2,Why even Make it.,"This was definitelty not a good movie. I pretty much like to watch any movie, but minus the few decent action scenes and Sean Connery, this movie was a complete bomb. The story was almost nonexistent, I really hated the fact that I bought this one because it is a watch once and forget about."
1,Are you serious?,"This stinker is getting 3 out of 5 stars? It should get none! This was one of the most cheesy, overblown films in the last 20 years. Questionable acting, incoherent plotline, a script totally devoid of surprise or suspense, terrible cgi effects and a boring ""cliffhanger"" climax that led nowhere.This is very much a ""You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss 10 bucks goodbye"" movie. I'd sue if I could get these two hours of my life back. Do NOT make the mistake of watching this gargabe. Connery has been in far better films. This was the sludge of the '03 summer ""blockbuster"" season."
4,high adventure and a great cast,LXG has all the thrills and cheesy fun of an old comic strip but with modern fx and a top-notch cast. I liked it very much and will be buying it for my christmas stocking. It's not for everybody but those who love this sort of thing should find it most appealing. One of the funnest movies I've seen lately.
4,Enjoyable!,"I enjoy this movie from a literature standpoint. It is fun to try and catch all of the quotes from the books each character represents. It has become a game for my children and I. Watching it with my children has also encouraged them to read more classic literature to find out about each character and what they are ""famous"" for."
2,I bought it today...,"...and having rented it once before I have no good explanation for it! This is all effects, and a ""flatline"" script. And not something Connery should waste his talent on. After all, I do miss a good, new classic from him now not having seen him in a in a good picture since perhaps The Rock, that movie was ok.If you didn't like Van Helsing, I know I didn't - then stay away! All these different famous characters (Mina, Dr.Jekyll, Captain Nemo and more) who appears in the movie simply don't belong together in the same story. And I realize that this is an adventure-movie, fiction, and a bit wild imagination - that I in fact do believe a have a doze of myself, but the story of the movie somehow doesn't fit anywhere, wether it's on screen or paper. This is a technical overdoze, and I agree with one of the reviewers below who didn't like what the moviemakers have done with The Nautilius (spelled correct here?).Some movies should just not have been made..."
4,fun film!,"maybe you have to be an avid reader to enjoy this? i enjoyed lxg more than most of the newer movies i've watched lately. i know that there are those who would say that those movies are better but i had a better time watching lxg. it's fun. sure it's a wild fantasy type movie filled with literary characters, but that's what i liked about it. i've had it two days and watched it twice!"
3,"At best, a rental","Do yourself a favor and save your hard earned cash for a dvd more deserving of prominent display on your shelf. It's not that LXG is a bad movie - at best, it's a decent 1 hour and 47 minute diversion, but most likely something you won't watch repeatedly. The most painful thing about watching this film is the realization of the great unfufilled potential that this movie/franchise could've been if executed properly. After all, one only has to read a single issue of the original comic to realize the high quality of the series not to mention the terrific characterizations to realize how much better it should've been.The video transfer and dolby 5.1 is decent but not spectacular. The extras are comprised of two very dull commentaries, 7 or so very long 'making of' featurettes and a handful of deleted/extended scenes. surprisingly there is no trailer included - instead we are given a somewhat strange drunk driving PSA."
1,Worst movie of the century (but we have 97 years to top it),"Did you folks see this at the theater? It was there barely over a week before it was shelved. My wife and I should have known by the seven other people in the theater (on a weekend, none the less). It is painful to watch -- by far Sean Connery's worst film. Unlike some films that are bad but humorous, this one was just bad. Nothing campy or entertaining about this loser."
1,Read the Book Instead,"Do I need to say more?PS: That's right, Bob from NY (the guy who entered the same review 8 times - what a jerk!), it's ""not as bad as some say,"" IT'S WORSE!"
3,books! who cares about books?,Making a movie based on books was a dumb idea. The Matrix makes more sense because it's based on computers and everybody knows computers not books. The FX were OK and I liked the vampire and Mr Hyde so the movie get 2 and a half stars but next time these movie people need to make modern stuff.
5,splendid,LXG is a great action movie with various literary characters being brought together to keep a madman from plunging the world into war. The cast is super and there's plenty of action and exciting characters. I rate this at the very top of the fun index.
1,The League of Extraordinary Crap!!,"I am sorry...I just have to know who was the fool that thought up this tragedy of a film??? From the beginning of the film, the premise made no sense whatsoever!! There are some fictional characters in this movie that I have never even heard of...and in the meantime...do I care if I heard of these people...NO!! There are some good action scenes in here...but those scenes still did not pull this one out of the bucket! Another thing...whoever heard of a car that was built for maybe 2015 in a film that is set in 1899??? Hello!!! Money can be replaced...your time is priceless...so don't waste it on this disaster of a film!"
2,It's a BAD LEAGUE.,"There's so much nonsense in this movie that it's ridiculous. The league consists of characters such as Tom Sawyer (Yes, it's true!), Captain Nemo!, the Invisible Man, Dr. Jekyll/Mister Hyde! etc. Somebody had let his/her imagination gone wild. It's so wild that it's really ruins the movie. The dialogues are bad jokes. The acting is luke warm. There are some good special effects but they can't save the film.It's still worth watching once for curiosity."
3,An okay movie!,An adventure movie that follows the same basic predictable plotline as other adventure movies!! Rent this movie. Not worth buying.
4,"not art, but fun","LXG is dumb fun. It's really corny, but it reminded me of a Victorian era Super Friends and that made for fun viewing. I'll probably end up getting this to watch from time when I need some corny escapism. It's not impossible to watch at all. It's just VERY corny. Some people just need to get the log out that's made them forget how to enjoy a really corny super hero flick. This is ""bad"", but that's good."
2,Just plain bad,My brother bought this for me as a gag gift. I watched it once and I have to admit that the silly plot and poor dialogue did produce some laughs but for all the wrong reasons. I still can't decide if my brother paid too much for this gag.
3,THREE AND A HALF STARS,"LXG is a good popcorn movie. Most modern audience members who don't remember, or care for, the imaginative cinema and literature of the past may be clueless of it's charms, but it's a quaint throwback to the days of Irwin Allen and George Pal with modern visuals. Pretty enjoyable."
2,Bad execution,"The premise of this movie is quite interesting, especially the twist that the main characters of this movie are famous characters from classic novels (captain Nemo, Dorian Gray, etc.) But everything else in this movie, quite frankly, stinks. It looks like Sean Connery is the only actor in this movie that can act (I was feeling sorry for him as I watched). The plot is practically non-existent - yes, there is a villain that wants to take over the world, but I would think there should be something more in the plot besides this. Whatever happens throughout the movie seemed to be glued together without much thought. I gave this movie two stars just because of the good original idea."
4,A fairly decent movie,"Putting aside some of the poor special effects, the premise of this movie is fantastic. The bringing together of characters from what you could only call the classics of literary history is ingenious. When I watched the movie, I had no idea what it was about, only that Sean Connery was one of the actors. As the story progressed, I was amazed and excited as new characters came into play. Alan Quartermain, Tom Sawyer, Dorian Gray,Captain Nemo, Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde,Invisible Man,Mina Harker,and Dr. Moriarty. I found myself looking and wondering who was to come next. (again I knew nothing of the story, but I knew the background of the cast of characters) Watch this movie with an open mind and put aside the minor production stuff. It was thoroughly enjoyable."
2,Not good.,"Can't quite give it one star (that went to Jackie Chan's ""The Medallion"") but boy, was this bad. Plot holes, bad special effects, too long, ugh. bleah. Don't buy it."
2,Comic Book Flair but no Substance...,"What a great idea it is to bring England's most famous literary characters to life. And such a wonderfully diverse group....who'da thought Dorian Gray and Captain Nemo could possibly meet Mr. Hyde, Tom Sawyer, and more? The premise is enchanting and exciting...........however the follow-thru is the same-old same-old of many previous cartoon hero movies.It's worth a rent, fairly fun, but leaves you thinking how much better the idea could and should have been."
4,Great movie minus 1 character,"I personally liked this movie very much. It was a clever mixing of some of the most well known characters. The only one I was disappointed with was Shane West's character(Tom Sawyer). He was amazing in a Walk to Remember but his attempt at a Southern accent was pretty painful. Sean Connery was of course amazing. So overall, I liked this movie very much!"
3,Delightful Movie,"This is a delight to watch, although nowhere near as good as expected. It features the likeness of a number of comic characters.The DVD features two commentary tracks, one with the producers and actors, and a second with the visual effects team. It also includes a ""Making Of"" documentary, and number (12) of deleted scenes. A good movie despite my feeling that it could've been better.It gets a solid recommendation."
4,Slightly Better Than Average Movie,"Movie about a group of people with individual ""special"" powers who are assembled to save the world. It has some intersting visaual effects. The plot, though not overly interesting does keep you guessing. There are likeable characters in it. Its good entertainment. Something I would watch a time or two more."
2,Puzzling...,"I went to see this movie thinking that it had to be very good since Sean Connery was in it. He did a good job, but overall, I was rather puzzled, both by the movie and Sean's choice to play in it. Had I missed something? The idea of bringing together characters from different classics - like Dr. Jekyll, Dorian Gray, and captain Nemo - is rather interesting, but still... What's the catch? Action, action, and more action. Is that it?I saw another reviewer say here that the movie is based on a comic book and therefore is not to be taken seriously. Maybe that's the trick."
1,Even Connery couldn't save this bomb,"WOW! Let me start by saying this movie sucked! It was so incredibley stupid and amazingly annoying. I had to shut it off halfway through because I was so frustrated with the lack of intelligence that was put into making this movie. It felt like they were ripping off Indiana Jones, X-Men and The Mummy all in the same movie. Let me say that both Indiana Jones and X-Men are both great series but the Mummy sucked. Unfortunatley this movie makes me want to see both Mummy movies twice over again to avoid seeing the League of f**king stupid gentlemen once."
2,Great if you want to try your new home theater..,"So, you just bought a new home theater system and you want to see how it works..this is a good choice for you. If you want to be able to turn off all but the visual areas of your brain for 1:45, this is for you. This is a fairly mindless special effects movie with plot as a secondary concern.I see this as a less than successful attempt to create a 19th century version of the X-Men. RENT BEFORE YOU BUY! (Sean Connery must be getting low on cash.)"
1,Waste of money and time!,"I like Sean Connery, but this movie sucks BIG time!Save your money and if you are truly desperate buy it used! When it is a bad movie there are a lot people selling it cheap and that is always a good indicator, just see how many are available!"
4,B movie fan's dream,"Reading and ""B movies"" are my great passions and LXG is just what the doctor ordered after a tough day at the office. It's a big budget over the top ""B movie"" popcorn flick with all my favorite characters and my kids love it too. Having it on DVD has been great fun."
3,disappointing,"Man, this had promise...Man, did they fail to follow through on this promise...You know, it's hard to distinguish exactly what went wrong here. Sean Connery was great, cool effects, intriguing characters. The movie just failed to come together.And a car chase through Venice? The streets are all 10 feet wide and 20 feet long! c'mon, movie makers. We're not complete idiots...of course, someone was buying tickets to all those Tom Green movies..."
1,Horrible Movie,"This movie fell flat on all counts. The graphics although very pretty, did nothing for the terrible acting and horrible story. I loved X-Men and was really anticipating the release of this movie. If memory serves it only stayed in the theatres maybe two weeks before getting thrown into the dollar theatre. Don't waste your money or time watching this flic... You will be disappointed."
1,Sean Connery's Biggest Mistake,"My brother asked me awhile ago if I ever saw a movie with Sean Connery I didn't like, after this movie the answer changed and I didn't like this movie at all. With I had never seen it. I know Sean Connery can act but in this it was just to much trash around for good acting to fix."
4,a fine popcorn movie!,"No, this isn't great, thought-provoking art. But I still found it a thoroughly entertaining action-adventure story. If you've read anything about this, you know the premise: a number of characters from Victorian fantastic fiction team up to fight a villian trying to start the first World War. Sean Connery is excellent as always, the rest of the cast is definitely competent. But the real star of this movie (and any movie like it) is the action, which is pretty much non-stop from the very beginning.I also found the behind-the-scenes documentary to be rather interesting. In an age when most SFX are CGI, it was nice to see the crew making things ""real.""I can't say this movie had any sort of profound effect on my life. But if you're willing to leave deep thoughts at the door, this can be a fun and entertaining way to spend a couple of hours."
2,Sean blew it by doing this movie.,"In an extra feature about the making of the movie, Sean Connery stated, ""I turned down The Matrix because I didn't understand the script; then, I turned down The Lord of the Rings because I didn't understand it; I didn't understand the script for this movie either, but, considering the others, I thought that I should do it."" The third time was definitely not the charm for Sean.This is one of those movies that had a lot of potential to be great, and I really wanted it to be great. As I viewed it for the first time, I did my best in trying to imagine that it really was great. However, the disappointment resulting from being excited by the storyline only to find out the film was actually not-so-hot made it, in the final accounting, a real stinker. I should have spent my twenty bucks elsewhere."
2,"Rather boring and too unrealistic, even for an action flick","I was bored during the first 45 minutes of this film until it started to improve - slightly. The actors were all superb and outstanding, especially Peta Wilson - the sexy vampiress! She brought a significant amount of life to an otherwise very dull movie. All of the actors were believable and great in their roles. Unfortunately that was not enough to make the movie interesting. The plot is too unrealistic, even for an action movie and seems to plod along endlessly until you can't wait for it to end. This movie was quite a snorefest and I doubt I will be purchasing the DVD when it becomes available. The best part of the movie next to Peta Wilson's performance was the ending. And I don't mean because the ending was good, I mean because it was OVER!!!"
1,worst movie ever made,"i got this movie thinking it would be great because alan moore's books are awesome. i was mistaken. this is probably the worst movie you could ever see. the acting is terrible, the diologue was terrible, the effects were terrible (flashing lights when jekyl turned into hide). v for vendetta is an example of a good adaptation. This is an example of a terrible one."
2,So wanted this movie to work,"This movie was ""watchable,"" and I use that term loosely bc it was hard to see what was going on half the time, but when it was all said and done... I was very disappointed. I really was looking forward to enjoying a fun adventurous summer movie, but it just seemed like they just slapped this thing together. Not much of a screenplay to speak of. I did like the backdrop though and the concept of the movie also was intriguing. Sean Connery did a great job, man he can still kick some booty, and so did the guy that played the invisible man. All of the casts together, just didnt have any chemistry. I had a tough time having fun watching this movie and thats a shame bc it could have been a great movie.A piece of advice, wait until it comes out on DVD or better yet go see Pirates of the Caribbean"
3,Another poor adaptation of a great comic book.,"Yeesh. An inexcusably muddled, disjointed action film. Sean Connery is the sole redeeming feature in a movie that is otherwise distinguished by poor sound design, overly busy visual design, negligible character development; flat, occasionally chintzy special effects, and very little of the dry ironic humor that marked the original Alan Moore graphic novel. It's all just so blunt and obvious and poorly rendered. Why? Why, why, why why?? Can it really be that hard to make a good comicbook action film? (Axton)"
4,Not Bad,"Despite alll the bad reviews I've read and knowledge of poor US box office receipts, I still decided to take a look at LXG. I did so because I liked the premise and I liked what I saw in it's trailer. To be honest, I wasn't disappointed by what I saw. I saw adventure, action, SFX, vibrant characters, and a vast story/plot.My analysis on why I wasn't disappointed is the fact that I haven't read the comic book. Anyway, to those who haven't seen the movie, please give it a chance and there may be a possibility for a sequel."
3,Great filled with Literary Heroes!!!,"To truly appreciate this movie you had to have a love of literature. This movies brings together some very unlikely heroes to help save the world from a madman that is planning the destruction and take over of the world. Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man, Wilhelmina Harker, Dorian Gray, Tom Sawyer, and Dr. Jeckyll. Connery is Quatermain. The movie is really good, and it really surprised me. You have the usual plot of who is trying to be a saboteur, who can you trust, tease of a past love affair, and some good action. While this movie is not great, you get drawn in. I was really enjoying the Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde character!!! Watching him change, and this big monster actually be heroic!! You will find yourself rooting for him big time. I really enjoyed this picture. I also enjoyed Mina's Vampire character. She was so lady like, even after biting someone's neck!!! Loved her!!!"
4,"Not bad, not bad at all, and it has a message","Inferior to Underworld, far superior to the Matrix and Terminator III.This film is based on a hit comic book. It is set in a fictional Victorian era, where all the inventions of Verne and Wells were actually made. When an international terrorist attacks the UK and Germany using new inventions (the tank and the rocket propeller grenade), a group of extraordinary individuals are assembled to track him down. They travel in captain Nemo's submarine.The special effects are good, the acting more than adequate (Sean Connery is Allan Quartermain). The scenery is evocative, especially the vision of hell in Moriarty's armoury.The film has an unsettling message: the best brains in the world can be corrupted into evil, or duped to be its servants. In the end, the league only delays the inevitable. Overall, the film is entertaining; good to watch over popcorn with friends."
4,Great Book!,"This book includes three stories all revolving around one location, San Juan Islands in Washington State. One author started the stories by setting the scene, then two other authors continued with Debbie Macomber's story in the middle. I have enjoyed much of Macomber's work, so I selected this novel to a quick summer read. I truely enjoyed the combinations of the three authors, and all three stories were enchanting."
1,Skip the Summer Place,"This review is for the Audio version. I would not recommend this tape to anyone! The narrarators are soooo dramatic - for instance in the first story ( I can't even remember the title, it was so bad) the person reading the story emphasises every last word of the sentence, whispers and has to take a breath every few words. It is very annoying. I couldn't listen to any more than 20 minutes of the story - that's how bad she got on my nerves. The second story was not much better - she should have skipped the accent and I was disapointed in the storyline - Susan Wiggs is usually much better.Maybe reading the book instead of listening would make a difference. But I will never know because there is no way I would waste more money on these short stories."
3,"Three Stories, One Book","I borrowed this book because I am a fan of Debbie Macomber. I didn't know that this was three different stories in one book. I didn't really care for this style of book. I felt like all the stories did a decent job of creating a picture but once they got to the plot, I felt the endings were rushed. Overall, I felt the stories were lacking in creativity, and particularly didn't care for the last story which just seemed pointless."
1,Ridiclious Mistake,"Should had read the other reviews before ordering.Upon opening my package I found a filter cartridge set that did not even remotely resemble what I ordered or the ones in the picture. Instead I received ""Carbon/floss filter cartridges"" which are tube like and small. How does someone mix that up? I could have just picked up the filters at the store but now I need to repackage the item, go to the post office, and then to the store anyway (not going to order these here again). Bad service."
1,Doesn't work...,"Simple enough, I was looking for a good sponge filter and decided to splurge on one of these rather than just making my own. Poor choice, it turns out, because I ended up switching back to my small whisper filter. Shame, I really liked the design, it just doesn't do enough mechanical filtration."
4,Nice entry to digital photography,"I bought this for my daughter because it is inexpensive and easy to use, and it's been a lot of fun. You will be hard pressed to find a better 3.2 megapixel camera for the money. Picture quality is excellent, operates on two AA batteries (get rechargables with a recharger because battery life is short), downloads your photos in seconds to your computer through a USB cord that comes with the camera, has a zoom (the 5x max zoom is not sharp; you are better off cropping and enlarging a non-zoom photo image on the computer), the flash is decent, and the features are functional. My daughter loves it. I have been a confirmed film camera purist and still prefer my Nikon with its hefty 28-210 zoom to a pixel image, but why lug that around when we have this little pocket wonder? A perfect introduction to digital photography..."
4,"Nice Camera, nice price","This camera is pretty neat , light weight, excellent quality and nice videos. I bought this camera from Amazon about 2 weeks before and it came with 64 MB Flash Card other than 16 MB internal memory. The only flaw I think it has is the quality of snaps taken in little dark places are not good enough according to the canon standards. Otherwise, its really nice to have such camera at such a low price."
2,Great price but kinda lame,"I bought the A310 because a friend broke my digital elph and I didn't have the cash to get a new one. I've always had fantastic experiences with canon products (printers, scanners, cameras) and at $125 for a digital camera how could I lose. Sadly the A310 is no elph. It's bulky and it takes way too long between photos to capture anything quickly. It's just sort of...eh. The price is right but I advise you to save up anther $150 and get an Elph. They rock!"
1,This camera is not for the novice,"This camera sucks for a number of reasons. I got this camera for a wedding gift that I regerstered for after reading all the great reviews. I was conned. Being my first digital camera I found it hard to use. The camera would not focus and would never take a picture. Having a two year old I needed to be able to take quick shots just like my old point and shoot camera. I would depress the button and the camera many times would flash busy? I'm not sure if this camera was aware that I needed it to free itself up for me, and take some pictures. Plus there are a ton of features on this camera that are suppose to be really helpful and cool but, only ended up being a waste of my time. If your not a pro and you need a camera to do its intended job and take pictures, then this camera is not for you!"
1,I did not like this camera at all--replaced w/ Minolta G400,"Two days after I purchased this camera, I returned it to Target. I can read and follow directions and the book appeared simple enough to follow, however, the camera did not respond. I could not format the SD card, the display always read, busy, and after trying to review photos, I always received the message, no image available. If the directions are too hard to follow, then this camera is not for me. If my particular camera was defective, then this brand is not for me. Defective cameras should be caught by the manufacturer before they are shipped to the store."
2,Not Their Finest,Bought this as a favor to a friend with no Amazon account. He was not happy with the camera overall. He found it hard to use.
5,Excellent Camera,"This is just an Excellent camera. I have bought 3 till date for me and my family. There are people out there to criticize it for faults like No optical zoom but these are functionalities of the camera that are specified in the Description, so if they haven't read them before buying it then its their fault. Its not that it malfunctions after u buy it or the Optical zoom capability disappears after one purchases it, so please think before criticizing such as excellent product.This product from Canon may go down as a Classic. Its photographs are mind blowing and videos are crystal clear. Ive dropped the camera from my pocket while jogging onto solid Tar and it came out unscathed. It can a beating and its worth more than the 125 bucks Ive paid for it."
4,Thanks to a review from 2007 Canon fixed my camera for Free!,"Thanks HKC for your April 2007 review!! I have had this camera for about seven years and the LCD viewfinder went out on it. It wouldn't take pictures but everything else seemed to work. After reading HKC's review that was posted in 2007 describing the same problem and that Canon repaired the camera for free, I went to Canon's website and they were still offering free repairs for failed LCD viewfinder problems! I contacted them and they emailed me a prepaid shipping label and they would also pay for the return shipping. I sent in the camera it was repaired and returned same day they received it. Now my camera is newly repaired and works even better than it used to. Thanks again HKC!"
1,Just not my kind of camera,"This camera did not live up to my standards. I just wanted a simple nice camera that took clear shots and was able to take a picture without taking 2 mintues to do so. And a camera that can take good pictures even if your hand is shaking a little...apparently this was not the camera for me. I had this camera for this years, I got it for my 15th birthday and at first it was a great camera because it was my first but then it quickly got annoying. Now I can't even download any pictures onto my computer and it takes a long time to even take a shot...while you hope it turns out semi-clear. I was not happy at all. Plus, I found another camera that was actually cheaper than this one and was 100 times more coperative. So I would say this is a horrible purchase and do not even think of giving it a try."
4,Love it!,"I love my lomo Horizon camera and have taken it on several vacations. It's contruction is very rugged and it came with a pretty cool pack which has extra areas to keep a few rolls of 35mm film. You can get the film developed anywhere but you'd probably have to either scan it yourself OR have them burn the images to CD. Also remind the lab to NOT CUT the film because otherwise you won't be viewing your panoramics. The images are quite beautiful, sharp and crisp. You can also be creative with it at night using the longer exposure setting. If you're into lomography this is one camera to own, or if you simply enjoy shooting film in panoramic mode.one of my favorite all time cameras."
4,"Good, but...","Really good book; however it is only for people who understand strict Grammar terms (e.g. Accusative, Genitive, Nominative etc.) Best resource if combined with class teaching"
4,its works fine,"seems to work like a lug wrench should nice crome finish fits most sae nuts, got this one to replace my old one that was ""borrowed"" and never returned"
1,Terrible Book,"The plot of this book is very juvenile and is clearly one of the worst I've read is years. What a waste of money. I've read others by this author, and it's hard to imagine he actually wrote this crap!"
1,unneccessarily verbose -,"good - until Scott's parents become involved: who cares about Scott's parents problems? totally and utterly immaterial - verbose, filling pages with dah de dah . . .playground stuff. the plot was interesting until then but painfully and obviously predictable = God save us from verbosity and irrelevant words. It is my understanding, that if a sentence does not contribute to the total (story) then leave it out. Not so here. How many times do we have to know that Scott has learned survival techniques ?? I mean, how many courses did he go on. Wonder kind! the book I got was from local library and it's going back asap.regardsamazingjmo"
3,Scott Free,"My first Gilstrap book. I did like it and would consider reading another of his.I did have to laugh a bit when the killer mentioned his past Navy SEAL training. As if it was a short, quick training session. Whatever."
2,Keeps you waiting till the end,"Overall, Scott Free was had a good plot line. Gilstrap has created a character tons of teenagers could relate to, in a situation very few could relate to. Scott is faced with a problem not many others would be able to overcome. It was a little slow moving, but still managed to keep me interested throughout.He knows how to get to the readers heart. However, the writing was very predictable and un-original. The writing is not worth reading, unless you are desperate for an overlly long, dragging, predictable, wanna-be thriller."
3,GREAT SCOTT WHAT A BOY!,"I'm sorry, but I found Scott to be a typically self-centered, unfocused brat, one who could hardly come up with surviving the horrifying plane crash. Blue hair or not! He is pictured as an enterprising Indiana Jones, but he's really just a pain in the oops. Anyway, his mother and father, Sherry and Brandon, are just as bad, and Gilstrap lays a lot of blame on Cody Jamieson, who should have known better than to fly in a storm. But shouldn't Scott known better than to sneak off with him anyway? Scott's only 16, and his judgment throughout the book exemplifies his inadequacies.I didn't like this book as much as I wanted to; I found myself intrigued to reach the end because Gilstrap's writing is good enough to sustain interest.But, I may be getting old too quick, but Scott didn't charm me in the least."
2,Preposterous !!!,"I found ""no there, there"" in John Gilstrap's ""Scott Free.""Had I desired a soap opera I would choose Howard Fast or Harold Robbins and enjoy the ride with guilty pleasure.All I wanted to do was slap the mother, send the son to military school and have the father see a shrink.As if the central characters were not unsympathetic enough, the exploits of the son were beyond absurd.I can suspend disbelief with the best of them, but this was ridiculous.On the plus side it is a fast read. Many of the secondary characters are worthy, especially the cops...and the villain is colorful, interesting and entertaining.Mr. Gilstrap's ""Nathan's Run"" remain a favorite---I expected much more."
1,Disappointing!,"Unlike other Gilstrap novels, this book drags alone getting pulled by arrogant self centered, self serving characters. The missing boy asks too many questions of which there is no answer ""Why me Lord?"", etc.P.S. I rate all the other Gilstrap novels very high. This one I gave up on after 150 pages."
1,Ouch!,"If you had told me I would some day watch a legal thriller in which Michael Douglas played a corrupt DA and I would hate it, I would never have believed you. That is almost an achievement in and of itself...although maybe it fell short there too, as there is nothing about this movie that is thrilling. I spend half the time wondering how they managed to lure Michael Douglas into this stinker."
1,Don't Mess With a Fritz Lang Classic,"""Beyond a Reasonable Doubt,"" director Fritz Lang's 1956 exposé on capital punishment, remains unavailable on DVD. If only the same could be said about filmmaker Peter Hyams' unnecessary remake. The empty-headed 2009 version died a quick death at the box office - nearly qualifying for straight-to-video status. Even with his limited role, Michael Douglas delivers another take-the-money-and-run performance. It's time to give Lang's film noir classic a legitimate DVD release and wipe this travesty off the face of the earth."
1,HORRIBLE is too kind,"The worst MIchael Douglas film I have ever seen. Acting, story-line and backgrounds were high schoolish. You would think that everyone just decided to make a film overnight without any thought! Corny story and acting is the worst I have ever seen athough I have to say Michael Doughlas as always, did well but unfortunately with such a horrible supporting cast, this movie is not worth seeing."
3,Beyond a Reasonable Doubt,"I'm not sure why such negative reviews from some as this is similar to the original classic with a few new twists. I suppose these same people hatedThe FirmandRunaway Jury (Widescreen Edition)as they showed corruption in the legal system as well. I went in expecting nothing and I felt the acting, directing, production values, music, and camera work were all excellent. Anyone that enjoys thrillers or courtroom movies will probably find this entertaining. When a reporter believes that a lawyer is manufacturing evidence, it shows just how far he may go to prove it.CA Luster"
2,blah,I was disappointed with this movie. Michael Douglass was good but the protagonist was an irritatingly bad actor and the plot didn't live up to the previews.
4,real forensics,"It was a pretty good movie.it had me rooting for the good guys.it was suspenseful and rewarding. i was disappointed in the end. the producers should have left well enough alone and kept the hero intact.here is where the movie lost some credibility. the lead actors friend had his apartment(where the evidence was) B&E;'d, it was a shambles. same day BAD cop chases the guy causing him to Crash and burn (with the evidence).the film never addressed the peculiarity of these suspicious happenings.BTW, when michael douglas was brought up on charges, murder and attempted murder were never brought up. here is the clincher, since this movie focused on DNA evidence. Dogs have dna also, which could have been tested and proved that the accused was not bitten by a witnesses dog.from a stand point of reality. blah! but movies are supposed to be entertaining and not factual and that it was! The purty girl made it so exciting."
1,"Made Only $17,000 in Theaters for a Reason","What speaks volumes about the overall quality of this movie is that it was released in only half a dozen movie theaters nationwide, and grossed less than 20k at the box office.At best it's an average movie with no quality acting, which reflects the fact that only 5% of voters on Rotten Tomatoes actually enjoyed it. The complications that arise with our main character as the movie progresses are predictable, as is the ""twist"" that occurs at the film's conclusion.The biggest mystery of this film is how they were able to land Michael Douglas on the cast. Douglas has virtually no real screen time in this movie, which is a major disappointment for those of us who enjoyed his work in movies like King of California, Wall Street and Basic Instinct. No need to wait for the jury to return to the courtoom; my verdict is that it's not worth even a Redbox rental."
1,B Movie. Much worse than a CSI TV show.,Amateurish B movie remake of a 1956 RKO film. Uses every cliche in the book. Awful! How did they get Michael Douglas to do this film?
1,Yikes!,I don't recall seeing this movie playing in the theater...and now I see y....straight to video. Sweet fancy Moses this was a god awful movie. Douglas must have been drunk when he signed the papers as I was to enable me to watch all 105 minutes of it. The acting was just terrible like it was from a corny 1980 sci fi flick. The leads should give up acting and shovel *%&$ for a living....they can start by shoveling this film into the pile. I give it one star for the courage they showed to muster up the humility to make this monstrosity
3,An amazingly foolish plan,C.J. is convinced that the DA is corrupt and is manufacturing evidence in order to convict the people he is prosecuting so that he can have an unblemished record of convictions. C.J. tells his friend that he will prove that the DA is corrupt by getting himself arrested. He will protect himself by videotaping what he is doing so that he can prove that he is innocent.But is C.J. telling the truth? Is this really what he wants to do? Will the DA find out what C.J. is up to? How will he protect himself? Will he go so far as to murder people? Will the video that C.J. prepared prove his innocence? These questions and more make this an interesting thriller with twists and turns.
2,"OH NO, THERE GOES TOKYO...","If you have seen one courtroom drama you have seen them all. This movie is extremely predictable and poorly acted. Michael Douglas is stiff as he reads his lines. A reporter believes the DA is planting evidence (not in Philadelphia either!). He is also dating the assistant DA (one sex scene, no nudity). Rather than call in the FBI, he plans to catch the DA by making himself look like the criminal in a murder case with the aid of another reporter. The DA suspects he is being set up and the assistant reporter is killed along with the tape that would exonerate the first reporter. Now it is up to his lover to uncover the truth. It is a good story, just overdone. If you are going to do a remake, get Leonardo DiCaprio to play the lead. The movie moves slow at times."
5,Unexpected Outcome,This movie was really good and the story line is not always what I thought was obvious. I can't believe some of the bad press this film is getting.
5,Fantastic book for recent amputees or their families,"I had my left leg amputated in February 2003 after a motorcycle accident. A fellow member of my amputee support group at Harborview hospital in Seattle loaned me this book. Once I read it I realized that if I could work hard and keep my sense of humor that I would be able to deal with my handicap. The book covers the stories of amputees, most of the essays are two to five pages long so it is quick reading. There is a lot of practical information in the essays as the writers describe their problems and successes with various prosthetic technologies. Definitely worth reading if you are an amputee, know one or just want to see what the human spirit can accomplish."
3,Sticks to stuff,"I bought this to get my Amazon order over $25 and get free shipping, and having not even opened the package yet, I must say I really like the color coordinated packaging and how well the cardboard hanger matches the lovely product. If you need a glue stick, I would highly recommend this, even if you only plan on putting it in your drawer next to all your other glue sticks."
4,Rewritable CDs,"They do exactly what they say they'll do. I've had no problems with burning, erasing, and then burning again. The colors are an added bonus and can help you organize if that's what you're in to. lol"
5,God Bless Iced Earth,"Well, what we got here is a very special visual document of one of the greatest moments for heavy metal ever. After 7 years of constant listening to the magnificent Alive In Athens album, the time has come for one to confirm (with the eyes) that those two nights at the Rodon in athens were a glorious display of power. Yes, it was recorded only with three cameras, but, who cares? That situation only allows the viewer to see what was actually happening on the stage. One can focus on each band member for longest time of periods than, for example, nowadays Maiden's style of show editing.For a regular person this just a low budget recording of a concert, for any Iced Earth fan is the band at the top of their carreer (With the greatest line-up) captured on tape for eternity.I just love it."
2,The Blue Notebook,"This story had fantastic potential but I couldn't stand the stilted translation. It really destroyed the novel. I almost can't believe Juillard put his work into the hands of such an incompetent translator, as I know him to be a fine writer from his other book. It is painfully obvious to the reader that Leclerc is not a native of France, and this taints the book immeasurably. One can only hope he will choose a more talented--and qualified--translator before writing his next novel."
2,Nothing special...,"This French graphic novel leaves much to be desired, both in terms of story and artwork. The sparse tale is about a young woman glimpsed by two men from a train. Both desire her and pursue her in their own ways, with somewhat drastic results stemming from extreme coincidence. It's the kind of moody, frustrated tale that might work better as an atmospheric noir film, but in any event it's certainly not enhanced by the flat style and drab colors employed throughout. The translation seems rather awkward at times, although it's difficult to tell without reading the original French as well. In any event, there are many better graphic novels to spend your time with."
2,Not worth the money.....,"Sounds like a great idea but in action hardly worth the money paid. The battery compartment is hard to access and requires you to remove 2 tiny screws and insert 4 ""C"" batteries which weigh down the unit. The light is barely adequate for the task and the fan is a joke, it doesn't remove the smoke and at times actually blows it towards you. I felt like returning it after the first use but repacking it and going to UPS just wasn't worth the time and effort. Save your money and buy a light without the fan for a lot less."
2,Lincoln was wrong...,"... you can fool most of the people most of the time. The reliability of a historian does not rest on his/her fame, or even on writing talent or success, but also on the essential ingredient of intellectual integrity. Prof. Lewis has been, for a long time, a great denier of the Armenian genocide. He is contradicted by a historian who wrote: ""A desperate struggle between [the Turks and Armenians] began, a struggle between two nations for the possession of a single homeland, that ended with the terrible holocaust of 1915, when a million and a half Armenians perished."" Who wrote these lines? Prof. Lewis himself before he apparently sold out. Therefore, Five Stars for talent minus three stars for dishonesty."
5,Yum yum!,"A remarkable history of a very popular bird. Of all the foul fowl, the turkey offers a veritable vade-mecum of ornithological gastronomie. Mr. Lewis is to be thanked for this seminal contribution, his large ear lobes, and other legumes."
1,The Great Whitewash Continues...,"This book leaves out so many significant events comprising the history of the emergence of modern Turkey, that one cannot but question the veracity of other facts in the book by ommission or commission.Any other scientific work which leaves out so many significant facts would be denounced by its peers, but not in this case.Bernard Lewis is a clever and very subtle propagandist, oriented along American foreign policy hues, acquiescing a brutal middle eastern regime for geopolitical reasons..I wouldn't buy this book since it is not scientifically authentic ."
1,Beano purchase from Pillowflat,"I have purcased Beano in the past for about $ 45.oo for a 4 bottle pack. When I saw Pillowflat's ad for Beano at $46.00, I assumed it was a 4 bottle pack.When the order arrived, it was a single bottle. $46.00for an $ 11.00 item. A rip-off, plain and simple.When I tried to find a Return Policy, Amazon said Ihad to contact Pillowflat directly. Pillowflat has no telephone listing, and no E-mail listing. Amazon offered to forward an E-mail. Which was done. Therewas no response. I sent 2 more E-mails to Pillowflat.Still no response. I talked with a lady named Selvawho said she would file a claim under Amazon's customer satisfaction policy. Amazon informed me that if the product was shipped, and arrived, that Ihad no grounds for a claim. So Amazon protects vendors who rip-off customers, and refuse to respond to requests for information."
2,Not sure,"Sometimes it seems to help but it is hard to remember to use this before eating. The taste is rather unpleasant, very sweet."
2,Bland and mechanical,"Adam Dickens had a tough job to create a solo piano album from source material more suited to a contemporary worship band, and he does not manage to pull it off. I found his playing very mechanical. His arrangements, whilst competent, do nothing new or interesting with the music and his harmonies are sparse and repetitive."
5,Astounding Book!,"A simply astounding book. I learned that looking at the shape of an animal track is only 10% of the game! There's so much more, and this book teaches it well."
4,"Easy to read, possible life saver","I've been a Tom Brown fan since he first appeared on the horizon with ""The Tracker"" and ""The Search"" back in the '70's. I plan on field testing this book this summer, but my initial impression is that it is what I expected: well researched, helpful, easy to follow, fascinating. Of course, drawings and pictures can't convey physical impressions, smells, etc., all are which are part of the process, but considering the natural drawbacks of trying to convey a full-sensory experience in a two-dimensional medium, I think it does pretty well.Tom does most of his work in the Northeastern United States, so soil conditions, flora, and fauna are all a bit different from what one experiences here in the Northwest. Still, enough of the universal principals apply.And even if you never set foot in the woods outside your local park, it's an interesting read, as are all his works."
5,Neat,"Fascinating book. For someone who is really curious about tracking, this is the book to get. I've not found anything this good anywhere else."
3,Qualaitative Research and Evaluation methods,"I found this book to be quite thorough in its presentation of qualitative techniques needed for Research, although very dry in some parts. The author could have reduced the amount of pages with less stories."
4,Interesting and easy to read,"Very interesting, easy to read. For the person undertaking Qualitative research this book is a must to have.Patton has a way of writing that makes the reader feel connected to the subject."
4,Good book,"It is a good introductory book, it gives a lot of examples, easy to read, and it has an atractive presentation format. If you are interested on methodology, applied methods and tools, it can help you considerably. In my opinion it is not a book for epistemological debate."
4,M.Patton's Qualitiative Research Book Review,This book provides in-depth information about qualitative research that plays a very important role in the classroom.
5,Informative book!,I needed this book for a class.It is filled with many examples to assist in understanding the concepts discussed in the book.
4,satisfied,Item was received on time and looks OK; has yet to be seen and played with by my grandson but I'm sure he'll enjoy the soldiers
1,Go for Champion Nutrition,The is the worst whey protein I have ever tasted! It tastes like shredded cardboard with a bit of chocolate and coffee. Do not buy this! Champion Nutrition is still the best tasting whey protein in the market.
5,"Finally, a halal protein powder... IFANCA certified","I've recently blogged about this product on my website. And based on what IFANCA says, it's halal. Even have the certification. For those interested to see the cert, you can visit my blog post at [...]. Kinda nice to know that western companies are taking initiative to get halal certs for their products. Highly appreciated :D"
5,"The natural flavor is great--kosher/halal, no bloating, no problems.","Finding a whey protein like this one is a blessing for me. I drink it post workout(at night) and sometimes the next morning. Out of the 3 different ""natural"" whey protein products I've tried this is easily my favorite because I don't feel any bloating/indigestion and it definitely seems to be helping me recover from intense lifting as well as soreness I get from kickboxing/MMA sparring."
3,Just ok,Somewhat powdery that it can create clouds of powder when scooped from container. Taste is just fine.
3,Not the worst protein I've had.,Pretty standard protein at a okay price. My only complaint is that it tastes REALLY sweet; I don't know what sweetener is used but it is definitely the sweetest tasting protein I've had.
4,decent product,"I have gotten protein powders with & without artificial sweetners & this product without them is preferable to those with them when I am able to afford the price. I also need a protein powder with low carbs/sugars & this works well in that regard also. The taste is more plain than sweet, which is the point for avoiding the artificial flavorings but the texture is adaptable enough for me to mix with most things or even take straight (in small amounts) without mixing into much liquid or food."
2,Not much raspberry Flavor,This product is more of a raspberry cream. Far too much french vanilla flavor. And far too little raspberry. I will have to keep looking for a replacement for Designer Whey Raspberry(discontinued) this is not it!!
5,Excellent Strawberry Flavor,"This is my first use of Ultimate Nutrition ProStar Whey Protein. I love the violet-blue container it comes in - very stylish. The protein goes in very well with warmer water. Cold water takes a little longer. The second best thing about this protein is the low fat, sugar, and calorie content. The best thing is the excellent strawberry flavor. I highly recommend it. [Granted nothing beats mint chocolate flavoring (in general) but then the sugar/carb content increases and depending on your needs could defeat the purpose] I like the larger size and the price could be better. But overall, very high marks for this protein!"
2,"Nice video, unfortunately very poor sound.",Very nice video of some beautiful waterfalls. Nice music too. However it's not one of those nature DVD'S that make you feel like you're really there because of the soundtrack. Instead of recording the actual sound of the waterfalls they dub in a babbling brook soundtrack. That ruins it for me.
5,It's great.,"It's comfortable and fits fine. I still have the original model maybe 5 years now. I'd like to throw it out, but there's nothing wrong with it. This new one's even better. It's more substantial, (less show through) but still comfortable."
5,Captivating,"This Anita Shreve novel was captivating, titilating and a quick read. Your really feel the emotion of the main characters Andy and Eden. I was totally sucked into the tangled web!!"
3,Book club division,"We had a division of opinions in our book club about Eden Close. Many of us liked it, thought it was a page turner, and would recomment it to others. Some in our group thought it was shallow and predictable. One comment was that it didn't ""have layers"" of meaning or complexity. The ones who liked it thought the characters were well written and intriguing and that the twists of the story were pure gothic novel. I think anyone looking for a fast read would enjoy it."
1,Ending just awful!,"I read through all the reviews posted here and was amazed nobody said what I thought was the obvious--the ending did not work, because it was not in the character of Eden to do what she did, to continue living with Mother, as the author had built her character as spunky, rebellious, full of fire. I cannot imagine that a traumatic event would so de-stabilize her! Thus, the book was ruined for me by the character not staying in character. I'm glad Shreve ending everything so happily, as I invested some time in this book, her worst, as far as I'm concerned. But even the nice ending--and I did like the main character, Andy--didn't do it for me because of Eden's character change. Also I did not like the way most of the book was back-story. Talk about excessive flashbacks!"
3,not your usual mystery novel,"The setting of this story includes two farmhouses, side-by-side, but remote from anything else. The families living in them, each two parents and a child, are so different from each other yet unable to be completely separate because of geography. In the middle of the night, a scream and a shot ring out from one house, and both families are changed forever.This novel is a lovely bit of writing with a little flavour of a mystery novel thrown in. I like Shreve's conservative, contained writing style, and her characters are all quite realistic. A few parts dragged just a little, which is why I didn't give it a higher rating, but overall this novel doesn't disappoint."
2,A disappointing read after reading the Pilot's Wife.,"The book was sluggish, lacking substance. Couldn't hold a candle to the ""Pilot's Wife"". The story line was predictable. However, as usual, with Ms. Shreves' character introductions, the characters were well developed, apparent, and clearly defined!:), hence the 2 star rating."
2,"Unexciting, transparent plot","I really can't understand why anyone would be thrilled by thistired rehash of family secrets, young love and physical abuse. I readthis book because it supposedly is to be made into a film by Touchstone Studios. I see what appeals to the filmmakers: a potentially histrionic plot complete with bloody, violent murder and sexual abuse of a blind girl. The characters of Eden and Eden's controlling mother easily offer challenges to actresses. But the book as a whole and the rest of these characters (especially the male protagonist) are uninteresting and border on cliches. I sincerely hope Shreve's recent novels (I've only read this one) have improved since this, her unpromising debut. I was thoroughly disappointed."
5,As Good as The Pilot's Wife!,I read The Pilot's Wife first. Then read The Weight of Water - which I just wasn't as taken with. Hard to believe Eden Close was a first novel. So beautifully written and a true page-turner. I was only sorry I had to work in the day so I couldn't finish it in one day. Make sure you set aside time to finish in a couple days!
5,Typical!,Another example of Anita Shreve's excellent work! One of my favorites! A must read for any fan of Anita's or even a fan of good books! :)
2,Don't Read This Book,"Like so many other ""artsy"" writers, while reading this book of very little story, one gets the feeling that perhaps Ms. Shreve was paid ""by the word""."
2,Not her best..,I love Anita Shreve's books but this one is not worth the time. It's very disappointing given what she is capable of. The so-called revelation at the end is predictable and the characters are not rich. Give this one a pass.
1,unimpressed,"I found myself skimming through entire pages of this book trying to get at the meat of the matter. While the plot was interesting, I think it could have been better told as a short story. I found the novel to be unbelievable and the characters to be shallow. The writing style left a lot to be desired. I had four pages left to read in this book and had no problem putting it down for the night before finishing."
3,Different,"I have to clarify first that I am a huge Anita Shreve fan. This book, so, not so much. The writing is good, and the story as it unrolled was interesting. The technique of how the story was told, however, slowed down the pacing for me and made me a bit frustrated. So much so, that I turned the book over and walked away from it for a while before finishing it. The characters, however, did call out to me and I did want to read to the end. I think I would have enjoyed the story much better, however, had it not been written in, what to me, seemed like flashback mode from the beginning. Just not my cup of tea, but it could be fine for others."
5,Everyone Should Read This Book,"Everyone should read this book. Everyone will have a different response. If you read it 5 times, like I have, you will have 5 different responses but you will know there is only one Eden Close."
2,This book threatens to spoil the mystery of Orbitsville.,"This sequel for Orbitsville must have been forced by the publisher because of the popularity of the first book. This book is not at all as fascinating as Orbitsville, and over all I do not recommend reading it. I myself would have preferred having the puzzle unsolved to the New-Age-style explanation offered by this book."
3,Competent if Uninspired Sequel,"This story lacks the imagination or uniqueness of its predecessor, which I would have ranked higher. Perhaps there are common themes in Shaw's work, but his protagonist in this story goes through many of the very same personal difficulties and conflicts (wife, children, fidelity) as did the one from Orbitsville, although the two stories are separated by many years. This is in one sense a detective book. For those interested in the mystery surrounding Orbitsville (""Lindstromland"") it is answered (although this is not the detective part of the story). I found the explanation a bit hoaky, but it is thorough. Overall, this is a quick read and may be worthwhile for those who enjoyed Orbitsville."
4,Good value for money,"I am neither a pianist nor a Schumann expert, but I felt that, on the whole, this disc had earned its three-star rating in the 'Penguin Good CD Guide'. The recorded sound is not brilliant, but perfectly acceptable, and young Austrian pianist Stefan Vladar provides some fine playing with occasional real highlights: the 'Anhang Variation 5', for example, is full of poignancy, the 'Finale: Allegro brillante' is just that, and the 'Arabesque' Op. 18 seems to me to have just the right 'feminine' touch. On the other hand, there were moments when I thought Vladar could have put more nuances into the music or brought out even further the 'typical Schumann' naiveté of this music. But on the whole, this is, for a budget-priced disc, good value for money."
3,jockey,"I liked this book.Cindy was one of my favorite girls in the series. I wish her old boyfriend Max would not have disappered though. It was not my favorite THOROUGHBRED book, but I liked it."
2,not the best,This book was dissapointing because it's just another long halt before the derby. it seemes like the derby will never get here. Plus the dissapearences of old characters is encreasingly annoying.
5,Cindy's last hope,"this was a really good book! it was suspensful (i was wondering who would ride gratis and what would happen to wonder's champion) it was great to hear about what was happening with cindy! i like the character she has become ( when she was young she was very bratty but she isnt now) and it was great to hera about some of the horses in the past too. but what dissapointed me was the fact that the derby wasnt in this book!!! i wanna know who is going to win!! gratis, image or star??? maybe the next book....i reccommend this book to thoroughbred lovers ne where!"
1,Disappointing...More a Biography of His Wife,"Even though the book is 400 pages, there is very little of it dealing with Custer's life. The author will mention substantiating evidence, but then never provide it. For example, she refers to archaeology work done at Little Bighorn but never says what it is. The book focuses way too much on Custer's wife...for a biography of him. There are 100 pages dealing with her widowhood. After reading the book, I don't know any more about Custer than I did before reading it. I had expected some sort of biography since the title reads ""the life & death"" & then meaning of the myth from that, but the book didn't deliver."
2,More miss than hit,"If you ever wondered why Billy Wilder's last movie, Buddy Buddy was so weak despite a great cast and a great premise, checking out the Francis Veber-scripted/Eduardo Molinaro-directed French original L'Emmerdeur/A Pain in the A** gives some pretty solid pointers - it's not very good either, seemingly too satisfied at the cleverness of the conceit to really mine it for all its worth. Lino Ventura is the mob hitman whose attempts to set up for a hit for his unforgiving bosses are constantly interrupted by suicidal Jacques Brel in the next hotel room. Unfortunately the first 40 minutes are pretty flat scene setting, with the film taking forever to get into gear and then only cruising fairly gently with the occasional light smiles rather than belly laughs along the way. Veber at least would go onto do much better work.TFI's French DVD does boast a good widescreen transfer with English subtitles."
4,Brel at his comedic best.,"An outstanding vehicle for Jacques Brel to display his talent as the most hilarious idiot since Peter Seller's Inspector Clouseau. The humor is Gallic, with a few Pythonesque moments thrown in. Ventura is solid as the hit man who cannot fathom his increasing misfortune. My students love it in spite of the movie's rather bloody beginning (two assassinations). For fans of Black Adder, Python, or even Jeeves & Wooster, not to be missed."
2,Not a good text,This book is not worth purchasing if you have any knowledge whatsoever of the hotel industry. It attempts to cover too many topics in too little space and fails to penetrate the surface of any given issue. I think that it is probably too much to ask that an in depth analysis of an industry as diverse and complex as the hotel industry be compiled into a single volume.
1,Check your ipod first,"Have a second Generation ipod? If so, this is not the product for you. After buying my new green ipod I needed something to protect it, so I bought the ""Speck Nano SkinTight Delux with Holster."" It just didn't fit it. I tried, but the only way to fix it was to cut part of it off: don't do this. I sugest making sure the product detail includes the ""second generation."""
3,It does the job,"It does the job. I would have given this a higher rating except that the rubber is dull black, almost like a tire before you add tire shine... hmm that give me idea ;) Also it would be nice if the clip was integrated into the cover to give it a slimmer profile, this is kind of bulky, however being able to remove the clip is a nice feature."
5,CHANGE YOUR THINKING!,"THIS BOOK WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE! AS A CHRISTIAN IT'S HARD TO FIND BOOKS THAT TEACH THE TRUTH ABOUT GOD'S FINANCIAL PLAN IN FOR OUR LIVES. DR. HILLIARD IS NOT AFRAID TO GO AGAINST THE GRAIN AND TEACH WHAT THE BIBLE REALLY SAYS ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL HEALTH. WE NEED MORE BOOKS LIKE THIS TO HELP US CHANGE OUR WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT OUR FINANCES. GOD WANTS US BLESSED IN EVERY WAY. WITH BIBLE SCRIPTURES TO PROVE IT, THIS BOOK SHOWS YOU HOW TO BE GET FINANCIAL BLESSINGS AND WHY GOD WANTS YOU TO BE BLESSED."
3,Commands a huge snob appeal but in reality half-useless,"Would be very good were it not for MIX. Sorry, I can't be bothered with it, life's too short. Otherwise very good: clear and concise writing, all's very relevant, discussion deep, all's great -- re-write it in C and I'll give it five stars.This may not have been the case a thousand years ago when this book was written, but today there's enough good literature of this kind to not worry about TAoCP.The books' structure and depth are somewhat unique though, so maybe this set is worth having if you got a lot of spare time and some spare money, but remember, for most people the sample code will be inaccessible: it's written in an unreal BS assembly language."
3,Interesting but too dificult understanding,"I do not use to speak English, but this book give a lot of theorems that cannot be understanded if we don't investigate by ourselves.That make me a question: why I take a book if I need its bibliography to use it? Obviously, it could be I'm not too intelligent for this book. But I prefer the first tomes, where everyone can understand slowly or not every quiz.Despite of all, this book offers us solutions in a pack (as only Knuth can do) to program the best querys when invariant is not iterable."
4,Somewhat disappointed by sloppy folding,"There are already a lot of wise words written about the contents of these books. Although it may seem a trivial point in comparison to the contents, I was disappointed that the paper envelope around the volumes where not folded correctly, that is, the texts are not in the middle. A jewel like these books should not be present on a bookshelf in such a sloppy condition."
5,Just try sorting and searching with out this book.,I have to admit I am poor so I just bought the book I needed. I needed to build a database that did not use any commercial package. This book saved my bacon. I almost did not buy it when all I saw in it was math. But I was desperate and it paid off. Turns out you could not explain it any other way. I use it primarily for balanced trees. I may try some thing more exotic later. I can not tell you about the other volumes but this one will defiantly pay for it's self.
3,Needed extra's for my classroom,"The approach taken by Cutnell & Johnson is good, but I question their choice of symbols for several measurements. It was hard to sync the approaches and methods to the College Board AP Physics B curriculum. My district didn't have enough books to go around, so I needed to pick up some extra's to have avaliable in my room."
2,Not a particularly good choice for a course textbook.....,"This was the assigned text for my first-year physics course. The book basically consists of equations to be memorized and examples of how to plug numbers into those equations. There is minimal explanation, and it leaves any student unprepared for any kind of higher year physics course, without any idea of how these equations actually came about. Also, it was embarassing to walk around campus with such a cheesy attempt at cover art that is trying to make physics look ""hip""."
1,This book is utter crap.,"Okay.No student solutions manual. So good luck reasoning you way through the problems at the back of the book. No calculus, which actually makes things much simpler. The examples are not representative of the problems in the back of the chapters. Cumbersome algrebraic formulas that are not necessary if just a tad bit of calculus was employed. A waste of paper. Too bad universites use this, as the authors are obviously rip-off artists not at all concerned with the quality of their text, which is in shambles."
1,Worst Physics book ever seen,"This is the worst Physics books I have ever been FORCED to use! Unless you have no choice in this selection of books I would pass this one up. This has nothing to do with the store that sold it--with them I got the book promptly--this has to do with the publisher of this book!! I don't even feel the book deserves the one star I gave it, even my Physics teacher hates this book!!"
5,An excellent book for a particular audience,"This is an excellent book for a high school level physics course or a less than rigorous Physics I course at the college level. It contains no math beyond algebra/trig. For a more rigorous treatment, the book to get is the Serway/Beichner text."
2,Lacking in Solutions,"There are no answers given to the even-numbered problems at the back of the book. This renders half the problems useless for test preparation. How do you know if you have worked them correctly? So you buy a Solutions Manual, expecting that for another $44 you will be given solutions to the missing problems. Surprise! EVEN FEWER of the problems have solutions provided than in the text itself. How does Mr Cutnell expect us to check our work? WORTHLESS."
5,awesome,the book came quickly and was in much better condition than i expected. I am very satisfied!
1,Poor learning tool.,This book was real bad. I used it in Honors Physics and got 15% on tests and 55 class average. The book is bland and neads to be better at describing the topic.
2,Newton betrayed,"At a first glance I was attracted by this book and reccommendd it to the library. But later I realized tha the too many figures are close to be junk stuff...but later on I discovered a very band thing: Calculus is completely absent, i.e., the powerful instrument devised by Netwon and Leibniz is completely avoided and I think deliberately. A book for ignorants of mathematics and a betrayal of Newton and Leibniz, that what it is. In my country it would not even be adopted for High Schools."
1,This Book Sucks,This book is very BORING to READ and the answers that are given do not really help that much
2,"Brand New, fast delivery but missing some chapter answers","Received book before expected delivery date that is a plus. Brand new condition as advertised. Plenty of applications in the homework section. I only have one draw back, answers in the back of the book are duplicated for chapters 15,16,17 and completely missing for chapters 11,12,13,14...That ticked me off, since I could not ""test"" myself for those chapters."
2,an eyesore,"This book is painful to read. There are far too many unnecessary pictures, colored boxes, sidenotes, etc. The text itself is straightforward and would suffice with minimal digrams. This is simple material folks! There is no reason to overkill with embellishments. I don't appreciate all of the extra books (I paid enough for the text already) and internet resources. If I were a physics major I might appreciate these extra resources, however, most people (myself included) in an algebra based physics course are there only to fill a requirement."
2,Didn't like the product but liked the customer service,"The product I received was not what I expected. The perfume seemed old or stale. When I contacted the seller about this issue I got an apology and a full refund immediately. Like the title says, I didn't like the product but I liked the customer service."
1,Dolce & Gabbana is FAKE ***Do not buy this product from this vendor***,"Hello ALL,I ordered the perfume for my girlfriend for Christmas, she has been wearing this perfume for a few years now, but the perfume we both noticed that the scent is totally different. Bottom line the vendor is selling a bad product and should be reported to the Better Business Bureau and Amazon.com. They are selling us consumers a bad product. It does not even smell like 'light blue'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Used Item,"I do not like to brag about the good items I purchase, since people read others feedback; I only write the reviews for the items that are not in good conditions to warn customers about the product.They sent me the used perfume because the plastic cover that sealed the package was opened. I assume the perfume was returned to the seller, and they sent the used item to me."
1,The Fragrance Doesn't Last More Than A Few Minutes,"Light Blue's fragrance is great -- for about 5 minutes, then it's gone. I have never used a cologne before in which the fragrance dissipated so quickly. At almost $80 a pop, can you afford that? You might as well apply water to your neck. About 15 minutes after I'd applied Light Blue, my husband could smell it only after he literally put his nose on my neck!Don't waste your money on this one."
2,good but strong,"I worked at a perfume boutique for a while and was able to take testers home every once in a while, this was one. I do like it, but bottom line, im glad I didn't spend the money on it. It's very very strong which is not my taste. I prefer lighter fragrances that are more discrete, not the kind that suffocate everyone in the room. That's basically what this one does. Like I said, it's a nice smell, but after wearing it for a few hours (just one spray) my nose starts to burn."
3,Dolce & Gabanna Light Blue,Didn't smell right and almost like a knock off brand...I have purchased this in Department stores many times and this one just didn't smell quite the same.
1,RIP OFF!,I bought this thinking it was the REAL product for $70 it should be the real deal!! It does NOT smell like the real stuff. It has too much of an alcohol smell. I do not know if it is a defected bottle but I am highly upset! I would like my $ back or a different bottle. It smelled so bad I threw it in the trash!!! VERY VERY upset! I want something done.. I'm done with Amazon...
5,Just the right scent.,"My wife has tried a number of swcents, but none of them really worked for her. This was a perfect fit!"
2,Dolce & Gabbana Lt. Blue,This particular scent is weak and doesn't last long. My wife said she would never order this particular scent again.
2,The Jury is Out,"I bought this for my wife for Xmas. She has been using this fragrance for at least 3 years. I never told her that I purchased it online from Amazon. Today she asked me where it was purchased because the scent was noticeably different to her. Not entirely bad, just not the same as when I purchased Light Blue from local stores such as Neiman Marcus and Sephora. I would be interested to know if anybody else has noticed a difference."
1,Imposter Fragrance from NuBeauty,"The perfume I received from the seller NuBeauty was not the real fragrance. I have been buying this scent for years and was very disappointed to receive an imposter. In addition, the perfume had leaked during shipping. I am sending the product back and expect a full refund from the seller."
5,Amazing,"I have searched for a scent, for as long as I can remember, but I always found most to over powering. I am being totally honest when I say, this is the only scent I ever have truly liked. It has a citrus undertone and while the scent is obvious, it is not to strong. I wear it every day, and have had people say to me ""light blue?"". I would recommend it to anyone."
5,Love the Scent.,"This is an awesome fragrance. I would say it's more of a day-time perfume, because it has a very light, clean, citru-sy smell, which I absolutely love. I've had many people ask me what fragrance I'm wearing. 5 Stars."
1,Don't buy from Designer Shops!!! FAKE Light Blue,What a rip off!!! The scent goes away after 10 minutes. The box it came with is a regular carton instead of the velvety box the original comes with. The silver colored part of the bottle came off after a day. I bought an original from a reputable web store and was finally satisfied. DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!! AMAZON check this seller and ban it! This ruins my amazon experience. We need trustworthy sellers.
1,"Perfume, I think not, does not smell like anything","My husband bought me this perfume for my birthday. I was extremely disappointed, in fact, disappointed enough to search out the product and write this review. The bottle is pretty, the box is very pretty and so soft to touch. At first I thought I bought a fake, I really might have, but the packaging look authentic. There is no smell to this perfume. I can spray febreze on myself and at least smell something! Worst perfume I have EVER bought. If a fake then perfumania.com is to blame."
1,"Gone (no smell) after 5 minutes of having it on., sad but true.","Love Dolce Gabbana, light blue toilette - last bottle I purchased was from a department store and I loved it. One of the best eau de toilettes on the market. But don't purchase it here, something is wrong and you can't return it. Besides that, I order 1.7 fl. oz. and they sent me 1.6 fl. oz. and charged me $59.00 even that I wouldn't mind but the scent lasts minutes not like the bottle I purchased two years ago - it lasted 6 to 8 hours and even then you could still smell it. People are complaining and Amazon does absolutely nothing. I ordered Boucheron eau de toilette and the same thing. I've learned my lesson - read all the reviewd on different fluid oz. and you will see what I mean. Just don't read the reviews for the one you are purchasing. Those 1 reviews tell you a lot - same toilette and some have 4 stars and other toilettes have 1 star."
1,fake product,"the perfume doesn't smell the same, box was smashed alot was already leaked out. DO NOT buy if want the real thing. needs to be posted as FAKE. DISAPPOINTING gift for my girl friend. i know you get what you pay for but was mislead"
1,perfume,"Horrible, bottle was tampered with. Smells nothing like how it should. I have perchased this perfume for years and make no mistake this is not it! It's a fake or been dilluted."
1,no good,"i ordered Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue...(I've been buying it for years)it came quick in the proper packaging,however it smells awful, nothing like it should!!!!"
1,Fake,It doesn't last more than 5 minutes. I'm very disappointed with this purchase. I wish I had my money back.
3,"Great scent, but doesn't last very long!","I really loved this perfume when I smelled it in the store. I'm a fan of ""clean scents"", and this one has a nice, crisp, citrusy scent. The downside is that I feel like I need to use upwards of 10 ""squirts"" of this to even smell it on my skin. And even after that, the scent disappears quite quickly! I feel like I shouldn't have paid this much for a perfume that ... well, doesn't even ""smell""? I really wanted to love this perfume, but I probably won't ever buy it again. Kind of a waste of money!"
4,"Made in Germany, not the USA","I could only give it 4 stars as it is not made in America, even though it comes up Made in USA under the amazon search - What's up with that??? I happen to love this perfume and get complements when I wear it. My husband likes it too! ,,, on me!"
3,Satisfied with Service,I am very satisfied with the service I received from this company. I did get a defective product and they did promptly send me a new one. I am very grateful for that. They were very courteous and didn't even cause me any additional costs. They are very helpful and respond promptly. Thank you for being so prompt and kind in this matter.
3,Okay scent,"I usually prefer more intense fragrances, but D & G Light Blue isn't half bad. It's one of those lighter, breezier fragrances, but is has some muskier undertones that give it an extra boost. Sadly, the staying power isn't that great, so I won't purchase a full-size bottle."
5,perfect little gift,"bought this little perfume for my girlfriend as a hold-over until she could get a full bottle. wonderful smell, sexy and fresh."
3,Too light,"Absolutely beautiful scent but I find myself reapplying it every hour or so. It dissipates sadly enough.A light scent that smells ""clean""."
2,Does not last!,"I first smelled this fragrance on a friend at a Christmas party and had to have it..it is so light and beautiful! I was excited when it arrived, however my excitement did not last....just like this fragrance! No matter how much I spray on, it is gone before I hit the front door. It has a strong alcohol smell when you apply it, with just a tad of ""perfume"" smell..then poof..nothing. I want to go to the perfume counter in the mall and compare what I have with what the stores sell...perhaps this product is a ""knock off"". I love perfume and have many different, higher-end types, and none of them fade as quickly as this does."
4,Correction,I love this scent. I can't tell you whether to buy from this merchant or not but I can tell you that I went to the Dolce and Gabbano site and they do sell the 3.4 ounce - or more accurately the 100ml.
4,very nice,I did not realize that 3.4oz will be such a large bottle. should have gone with 1.7ozotherwise as expected
1,fake?,"the perfumes doesnt smell like the original D&G! it has a different smell... i want to return it. im so disappointed! but i had it shipped here in the Philippines,, can i make a refund???"
1,NOT THE REAL THING,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas. I have a bottle already bought from Macy's and this bottle is not the same (The color of the top).Even though this is through ""Amazon"" is says Amazon LLC, a private seller. And its not worth it for 10.00 less than Macy's."
1,D & G Light Blue a knock off or so old it turned into alchohol.,"I have had Light Blue from Macy several times. Which I loved, i found it on Amazon cheaper and thought how great. When I received it I immediately started using it. I could barely smell it, very unusual. So I decided to return this item. Never did I think I had to go through someone other then Amazon. To return I am informed I have to return to Perfume World. WHY???? I purchased from Amazon, Amazon was the one whom took the purchase. Never did I have to deal with Perfume World. Why do I have to deal with them at all??? This is frustrating and not legal. If I buy from Macy I return to Macys. They deal with the distributor. I have second thoughts of even having an account with Amazon. :("
1,D & G Light Blue,I bought this product off of amazon.com and when I received it half of it was spilled out of the bottle and the rest of the perfume didn't even smell like D & G Light Blue at ALL. This was a total rip off I wouldn't recommend no one to buy this product off of her.
5,My wife loves it,"This is the fragrance my wife loves.It smells great on her, but, lets be honest here dudes... she doesn't wear it just because I like it. She really likes it.One piece of advice: buy it directly from Amazon to make sure you get the real, quality merchandise.There is never an excuse for not knowing what to buy a woman. You can give them jewelry, flowers, chocolates, and perfume and if they are a good person they will appreciate it, even if they take it back for something that suits them better. (for men its knives, tools, wallets, belts, etc) These are the staples of gift giving, and perfume has the advantage that it gets used up and you can replace it every few years.Anyway I don't have much else to say. My wife loves it, and happy wife happy life."
1,Terrible negative experience,I will never use this shop again in my life! I received a broken bottle unseal packaging and less than 1/3 of the content.
1,D & G Light Blue,"Similarly, I ordered a bottle of D&G; Light Blue 3.4 oz for Women from seller ESSK Enterprisesbut the perfume is of bad quality.Probably they are adulterated."
1,"Wow, I can't believe Amazon is selling fake D&G Light Blue","My wife has used this since they came out and we have purchased from Amazon before. This, however is completely counterfeit. The fragrance is a watered down version of the original. I must say though, Amazon did the right thing and immediately provided a full refund.Amazon should get rid of their vendor that provides this."
3,light blue,"I am not that impressed with it, but I bought it for my wife and she really likes it which is what counts more than my opinion. It doesn't seem to be very strong to me. It seems to be very faint perfume but it also does seem to last a long time."
5,great perfume,"This is my favorite perfume of all time. Nice and light. If you want to wear a good smelling perfume that lasts all day, this is the one to wear."
1,This is a knock off,"I purchased this and am thoroughly convinced it is not the real deal. After wearing it several times, I realized that by the time I sprayed it and walked downstairs, there was no longer any lingering fragrance. I had purchased this before from department stores and know that it lasts with you all day. Very disappointed that this could happen at Amazon. Expect it on ebay, but not amazon!!!!!"
2,"Great seller, not so great product",I wear this perfume regularly and I feel like this is just a knock off version of it. I would not buy from this seller again even though delivery was quick and I did not need to contact them.
4,Light & Blue Shower Gel,"This is a nice complement to Dolce & Gabbana's ""Light & Blue"" cologne; now if they would just make a bath powder or an after-bath lotion!!"
3,Maybe it was the seller?,"I bought this as a present for my mother and she said that the scent was kind of dull, almost like it was stale. I think that I might just stick to buying perfumes in the department stores from now on."
5,My Wife Is Happy,Purchased the D&G Light Blue as A christmas gift for my wife. She loves it. If She Is Happy then I am Happy
3,Light Blue Detergent,"On me, Light Blue smells like laundry detergent.It certainly has a clean smell; but so does T/ide and G/ain, which is what Light Blue smells like. I'm not totally opposed to ever wearing it again; but I certainly won't pay the high price for a big bottle. I own a mini, and I'll use that until it's gone. But no more after that."
1,Very Light on Blue,"I don't really care for that hint of pine in the perfume, it irritates my stomach, I don't want to smell Pine trees threw out my day Ewwwhhh! I gave it away to a friend, she is happy!.........Im very light on blue cause its not for me!"
1,Smells like Febreeze on steroids.,"Me, at the laundromat, suddenly overpowered: Excuse me, may I ask what brand of laundry detergent you used? The fragrance is so... unusual, yet familiar?Fashion Victim Lady: Oh NO... that is not my detergent. That is ""Light Blue"" by Dolce and Gabbana. It is a beautiful scent. I only wish we could get laundry detergent out of it.Me: Stares, tries not to pass out from the neurotoxic effects of this crap."
1,I did not like...,"I purchased this for my mom as a Christmas gift, without sampling it first, based on the great reviews. Wow, I was so embarressed when she opened it and I smelled it for myself! Most scents do not appeal to me, but this was really bad. I do not think my mom was impressed either, although she did not comment. I feel so bad that I gave this as a gift, I plan on buying something else for her to replace this mistake. They sell this at Walmart, which says something."
5,The perfection in perfumery,"I am on my 3rd bottle. This fragrance represents to me everything, the freshness, the lightness, the sexines, the seductivness. One of the best creations of D&G."
3,Youthful sporty,"Youthful and sporty are the terms that comes to mind with this perfume. Like some of the users have mentioned, it has a clean feel to it.It has a powerful citrus smell. If you are looking for something along the sensual/romantic lines then this is not the one. It can be used as a day time perfume. Liked it, it most probably will be a permanent member in my shelf of perfumes :)"
3,Light blue dolce,"Smell doesnt last as long as I would prefer thru the day, although it has and excellent smell, with a light musk ."
5,"Light, Fresh, Keep me coming back...","I have purchased this fragrance several times over the past few years. It's light, fresh and not overly strong. It smells citrus-like to me but I've had tons of compliments, never been called an orange so apparently it works :)"
4,lemons in the summer,"I like this scent. It has a citrus/lemon scent. I spray it on my shirt, and it smells light and fresh all day. To me I would say the scent is for summer daytime use."
2,Good scent bad amazon,"I do like this scent but the one I received did not smell right and amazon's return policy for perfume is terrible. They claim it can't be returned because they consider it a hazardous material. That argument is lacking any logic since they ship it to you under the same conditions. Just know when you purchase this or any other scent all sales are final. So much for amazons great return policy. Also where is the verified purchase button, did they remove that from reviews?"
1,Weak smell,"If you buy it for smell only, consider a different lotion. I bought it for smell only, and id did not work this way at all! A waste of money."
1,Beware Online Knockoffs and Fakes,"Ordered a D&G Light Blue 3.4 oz perfume bottle from seller ""Jacobs Enterprises"" as a present for my mother. When it arrived, my mother complained that the perfume didn't smell anything like it was supposed to and that it barely had any of the longevity that it used to have with the store bought bottle she used. That's what I get for being cheap. It's better to buy perfume at the store to avoid getting a knock-off, lesson Learned."
2,Not very satisfied,"The product didn't come on time, it was 3 days late which I'm very upset about because the estimated time for delivery was December 14, and I needed it for the 15 for a Christmas party. I'm also very upset because when it did come three days late on the 17, the box was destroyed, as in the box it came in. As for the perfume box two corners were dent in it. I'm very displeased with how the whole thing happened. I will not buy from here again."
5,awesome fragrnace for women. one of the Best.,I smelled it first at a Club and one of the girl in my group had wore this cologne. I came to know that its D&G light blue after asking her. Went to Macy's over the thanksgiving and got set for D&G Light Blue but after checking prices on amazon I though why to pay some extra at Macy's. I was confused in case if I get those fake ones but after receiving my package. I am really happy.
2,scent wont hold up,I got this at a great price but now I feel it is either old or deluted. The scent is very low. Things I learn by trhing to save money. Why write a review this company wont do anything about it...
1,disappointed,Everything with shipping and ordering was fine according to my husband who ordered my favorite fragrance.....When I recieved this gift from him I was disappointed because I believe this item to be a fake fragrance or copy...I am very familiar with the scent and this is not it...I feel that you should be told if it is a similar item..
5,Clean & Fresh!,"I love the D&G Light Blue. It's a nice, fresh scent, especially for the warmer months."
5,Glad to see another guy here . . .,"Glad to see another guy here who likes to use Light Blue. I didn't know it was marketed in Europe as ""unisex."" I first smelled it on a woman and couldn't get enough of it. I realized it wasn't too floral, but ""clean"". I've never worn a ""woman's"" perfume before, but this is it!I don't care who it's ""for."" It works on me. Much subtler than most ""men's"" colognes. Just a great scent for either gender. Especially after half an hour. It's ""barely there."" But from then on it lasts forever.Brilliant stuff."
1,It smelled horrible!!,This product definitely didn't smell like it should of. Don't purchase from this seller. It appears that he's done it before... selling bad products.
1,FAKE Dolce Gabbana Light Blue all over the internet - WARNING,I just bought a bottle in the sealed package off a private individual on Ebay with a 100% rating that looks identical in every aspect to the bottle I bought at Macys last year. Only this one is a counterfeit fake. Be careful out there as there are thousands of fake bottles floating around. I cannot understand why Dolce and Gabbana will not clarify which is fake - the 3.3 oz. or the 3.4 oz.?
1,Don't duped like me! This company is selling imposter perfumes,Company was cleaver enough to advertise with all the indications that this was genuine Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue but when the perfume arrived it was fake. Do not buy from this company. I haven't filed my claim yet but I'm sure it will be a fight to have my money returned. Embarrassed to be duped by these thugs...thought I had taken the proper precautions
2,Not a great deal,"When I was searching for the best price for D&G Light Blue I was shocked that the price was so cheap for 3.3oz. I should have known better. The product arrived to me very quickly. The packaging was the same as if I bought it in the store, however when I used it for the first time the scent was ""off"". I still had some left from the bottle I had bought from a known department store so I was able to compare the scent. It was noticably faint. I could tell because by the time I sprayed it in the morning until the time I arrived at work the scent was all but gone. Even though I spent less money on more perfume I need to spray it much more often. Not a great deal."
1,Be VERY careful!,I bought this recently and I am sure it is counterfeit. The fragrance disappeared shortly after opening and the label letters came off in my hand.
1,DO NOT BUY FROM WEST PERFUME,"I received water in a bottle, I have used D& G Light Blue for years, this was not an authentic product, I contacted West, and they said as soon as I had a tracking number for return, they would return my money. They recvd. the pkg back on Dec 30, via fed ex. and I emailed them the tracking number as I was instructed to do for a full refund. They have not refunded my money, and I am disappointed in Amazon not helping with this situation. I spent a lot of money through Christmas with Amazon, I won't be doing it again."
1,Knock off,"I've been wearing Light Blue for over 5 years. When I opened the box and sprayed the perfume, it smelled nothing like Light Blue. Definitely a knock off."
4,kid jokes,"Great, silly kid jokes that my husband & I like a lot, and the artwork is very appealing, too. I was put off by the 2 weapon jokes, though I recognize that I told similar jokes when I was little. It's so dissonant with what we tell our son, though, that I'm shelving this book away from the ones we read with him."

3,Great cover and Illustrations ... but too academic,"This book reads like a dissertation. It's a great topic, and the cover and title promise much more than it delivers. I strongly suspect this was the author's dissertation project. That's fine because it's well-researched, and the author definitely is an expert on women in the 1920s. But it's a wet subject, and the auther serves it up dry. There's good information in here, but it'll be slow going. On the positive side, there are many great black-and-white illustrations."
4,Interesting Artist!,"Gashouse Dave, whose real name is David Shorey, is from the Boston area. Gashouse is no stranger to the blues having performed with Mike Bloomfield in the 70's and is even featured on a couple of Bloomfield's records.Anytime you buy a Gashouse CD, there is no telling exactly what you might get. The songs featured on this CD, for example, show a heavy Hendrix influence from the electroharmonics down to the vocals. Lyrically, he reminds the listener of Tom Waits.Bottomline is, the guy can rock! If you are feeling a little adventuresome, this is a good CD to buy."
1,cheap,"controls are cheap at best, needs a knob for the volume control, has good sound surprisingly, save your money on this one."
2,And the point of this book?,"We the Media is without any doubt the most disappointing book I have read this year. I was initially suspicious after I read the five star reader reviews that are posted here because they are just all hype and guess what I found? Buying this book was a mistake and so now I'm selling it used and advertising it as almost new, read once!To be fair, save your money and consider yourself warned. This book goes nowhere is repetitive to the point of annoying and I learned nothing about using the Internet except perhaps not to trust some of the reviewers and their unfounded praise for this book."
3,"Repetitive and blemished, but still worth reading","This is the first book I've seen on the incursion of citizen's media on the corporate news organizations, and has a fair amount of information on the history, and the technologies involved.Dan repeats himself a number of times; for example, SMS gets defined multiple times throughout the book. A good developmental editor would have caught these problems, but this isn't difficult to overlook while reading.The big blemish is that his left-leaning political views appear too often and too obviously. Early on, he even makes the claim that Big Media is politically conservative, something only he and Eric Alterman still seem to believe. His lefty, er, progressive readers might not notice, but because a number of the more popular blogs are antidotes to the liberal media slant, those of us who visit those blogs are likely to wince at some of his comments.All that being said, overall, it's worth the read, until a better work on the subject comes out."
3,"Brahms Hungarian Dances, Budapest Symphony, Bogar","I feel much like the first reviewer,Brett from Australia. To my taste, these Dances need a lot more gypsy PASSION - this from a native Hungarian who recognizes that passion when she hears it! Whereas the Vienna Philharmonic recording with Claudio Abado conducting gets that Hungarian blood moving..."
3,Not risky enough,"I've just listened to the preview tracks here, and they make me keep wishing I was listening toFritz Reiner Conducting The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. Bogar just doesn't wake me up, but Reiner so awash in passion and really rich luscious orchestral color. Reiner though only has a selection of the 21 Brahms's, with the Dvorak Slavonic dances too.But even beyond Reiner, there is another level ... If you want to hear someone really get fiery with the Hungarian Dances, it isArturo Toscanini. There are 4 of the dances in this Toscanini collection."
3,Not what Penguin cracked it up to be,"Despite Penguin Guide's encomium, I found these performances too light and mediocre at best, hardly ""Rosette"" material. Vanilla interpretations.For true Magyar eroticism and aroma, get Adam Fischer and the Budapest Festival on Philips, feverish versions leavened with cimbalom and Gypsy violin, or if ever reissued by Erato, Janos Rolla's Liszt Chamber Orch versions using the paprika-laden Hidas orchestrations for string orchestra alone (no woodwinds); both are fabulous."
2,not a Clay pot,Misleading this is clay colored plastic but good quality. be sure to read product info for size and weight. I am still learning to shop carefully.
3,ok,Meena is so excited that her class is putting on a play about little red riding hood. She gets the part of a tree in the play and she is really upset. She thinks that she is too clumsy to play a tree. Later she finds out about a yoga class and decides to try it. The class gives her confidence and she ends up doing a great job in the play.The little girl in the book feels like a lot of kids today. She felt like she was too clumsy to to the part in the play.Children who enjoy yoga and/or acting will enjoy this book.
2,No good for any kind of motion,"Canon make great cameras and their optics are second to none, but when are they going to make a camera that can focus quickly? This is my third digital Canon and I won't but another. It can take up to a second and a half to focus on the subject and it starts at macro and moves out to the focus area, which can make it take longer. The purpose of a still camera is to capture a moment in time, not several seconds after the moment.This camera takes wonderful pictures but is absolutely useless except for landscape.Try using it for just 20 minutes and you'll see how impractical a camera this is."
1,World's Most Expensive Disposable Camera,"I have owned the camera for just 6 months, and took good care of it. The lens stopped working and Canon will not give it warranty service, even though I registered the product, because I have lost the original receipt.They claim registration is only for software updates and prodcut recalls. However, I was never informed of the camera's firmware upgrade and had to find it myself on their website.I would not recommend any Canon camera. I have several cameras, includung digital that are much older and have received rough treatment in the wilds of Alaska. I have never owned a camera as fragile as the Powershot Pro1 and am severly disappointed in Canon's failure to stand behind their products."
1,terrible focusing/low light capapbility,"I bought this camera to replace a sony 2Mb digital camera after my first daughter was born. I thought I would be able to get amazing photos. The only good photos I could get were taken outdoors. Focusing in low light is impossible, so don't bother. The automatic flash washes out all photos regardless of settings. The autofocus is so slow you'll miss all good shots if taking photos of children. The macro focus capability is useless and can't focus at all on macro settings. All in all, don't waste your money on this Canon camera, try Canon's other brands which are far superior, ie SD550 or better still upgrade to a digital SLR like the 20D. I can't believe Canon has not recalled this camera! totally useless."
3,filter,"If you attached the filter adapter to the lens, and take a picture set to 28mm with the flash, there would be a darkened area size of half a quarter at the mid lower edge of the picture. The adapter gets in the way of the flash at 28mm.This is poor design for an expensive camera like the Pro1."
2,Bad camera for the price,"I bought the camera through the mail. Turn on the camera and there are two dead pixels near the middle of the LCD screen. Took some pictures with 430EZ flash using TTL and all pictures are washed out white. Canon said it's compatible with the EZ series flash but apparently not the case.Mail order shop told me that I can't exchange it for another one because two dead pixels on LCD screen is not categorized as defective. I don't remember paying $1K for something like this. Called Canon and they said I have to mail it to their repair center to get it fix under warranty.So, I bought the camera and haven't use it yet and it's costing me another $30 to ship it to get the LCD replace. What kind of quality control is this for a $1K camera?"
4,"Originally not happy, firmware update fixed that.","I was not happy with the autofocus, but the firmware update I downloaded fixed the constant refocusing plus other things. Everything else is great except maybe the Auto White Balance doesn't do too good where there is a mixture of light colors. The manual setting and recalibration of ""white"" handles those situations. Also I use a 1GB fast memory card and it seems to get sluggish when storing images after I have a hundred or so images on it; I think this is the file management.One big bummer: when recording videos, you cannot change zoom after you start the recording."
1,Dust,"I bought this camera when it first came out....great camera, but after 1 year I started to notice flare in my shots...but I was not facing the sun...months later the flare was getting worse, then I noticed dust INSIDE the lens. Other people have noticed this same problem and have experienced the same grain in their pictures. After talking with Canon, they will not admit that this is their problem because I must have dropped the camera...that never happened! This has now turned into a $1000 paper weight :(Last year I bought the Sony a300...a much more superior camera system...I have yet to experience any problems with this camera"
5,Powershot Pro 1,"I bought this camera slightly used on ebay for $499.00, and I love it!!!!I still have a Fuji 3.1 Mega Pixel camera - my wife has 2 digital Kodak cameras and the pictures on this Cannon are unbelievable! I bought this Cannon camera, because I already own a Canon XL1, GL1 & GL2 camcorders (I do wedding videography - www.digitalvisionsonline.com), & the settings are very similar.Once annoyance is the lack of a lens cap string.Battery life is excellent."
4,unique combination of features in the single device,"To start, I would like to note that I had purchased this camera in 2004 and took over 70,000 images so far with it. Back those days nothing better existed on the market. Still no one beats the unique combination of features this camera provides: small and light-weight, L-lens with 7x zoom (and as the result - amazing quality of images), video recording, flipping Life-view screen, durable aluminum body, top LCD, etc. It took Canon over 4 years to integrate some (but not all) of the Pro1 features into the latest DSLR. Sure, this camera is useless for night-photography but other then that - this single unique device can satisfy any and all needs as a walk-around camera delivering uncompromising image quality, something you can get only by investing at least 3-5K in to DSLR."
2,Disappointed after so much waiting :(,"I really, really wanted to like this camera, but I can't. On the plus side, it takes nice, sharp pictures (although a bit noisy in dark areas), and is built like a tank. But that's where it ends because it is absolute torture waiting for this thing to focus! Honestly, my four-year-old Sony Cybershot focuses faster which I simply cannot understand. Also, the LCD viewfinder freezes for at least one second for every single shot while it composes the picture. This is fine if you're shooting a bowl of fruit, but if your subject is moving at all, you're going to want to pull your hair out! I really wish this camera were all it was supposed to be, but you have now been warned. I guess I'll keep looking."
4,Sweet Guitar,"I was pleasantly surprised with this guitar. It has an excellent clean tone, something akin to a Tele, but it also distorts really well too. Even though PW mentioned it had a very clean, straightfoward sound, I was a little surprised at just HOW clean it is. I'm a pretty messy guitar player so I had to step it up a bit with the way this thing plays.But if you're looking for a good jangle, this guitar will work. My only criticism would be that the frets feel a little more jagged or big than I would like. But you can rip on this thing all day and have a blast doing it. It looks cool as hell, it's very lightweight, plays well, and you can't beat the sound for this price. I love that First Act's motto is basically, ""a cheap guitar doesn't have to suck."" The PW proves that theory. I love this axe and I'm really glad I bought it.If you like Westerberg's stuff, I think you wouldn't be disappointed in purchasing this guitar."
4,Nice Guitar for the money,"Nice guitar for the money. It has a nice bright clean sound. Also, very lite in weight so it's a joy on stage or playing at home. Only problem is the fretboard is dry. I recommend treating the fret board w/a polish or lemon oil to smooth up before you play it for the first time."
3,For the $$$ it works,"I had this a few weeks now. I'm a fan of Mr. Westerberg so I bought it for that reason only. As a player it's ok I play many high end guitars so with that being said, it's a bang for your buck so to speak. Fat neck,decent sound high action but again for the $$$$$ fun guitar.Mikey"
3,get what you pay for,"Been a long time 'Mats fan, so when I saw this Paul guitar, had to have it. Very decent guitar. My only minor complaint is that neck just doesn't feel ""right"". Went ahead and removed the low E (6th) string and tuned to Keith Richards's stylee. Sounds good thru my 25w Ibanez amp, get some nice dirty tones."
4,Color Me Impressed (for the money),"I am suprised at how good this thing sounds after a bit of tweaking. I cleaned up the sharp fret ends, changed the strings and did a basic set up. Then played around with the pickup height, and this thing plays and sounds pretty darn good for a 90 dollar guitar!.One can get a suprising variety of tones just using the tone and volume controls. Old School!The tone circuit might need a little tweeking, but a cap, resistor and a little solder should remedy that.All in all I would say thanks Paul!"
2,Sadly Dissapointed,"Having established a definite standard with his first CD, Make Time for Love, Keith Washington was truly a force to be reckoned with. His second CD was indeed a nice follow up. I was expecting more of the same from KW, however, what I find even more disappointing than the cd itself is the fact he allowed it to be released with his stamp of approval. If there was any chance for a come back, KW sealed its fate. Its not to wonder why we haven't heard anything from him since...who could possibly recover from such a disappointing CD. Keith's voice is still amazing, however, he is so much deserving of the smooth, romantic flawless ballads his first two CD's so prominently established. The production on this CD truly falls short of the magic he gave us in 1991 and 1993."
2,The voice is there. The material is not.,"Keith Washington's third (and to date, his last) CD is extremely disappointing when compared to its two predecessors. Keith Washington is a truly superb interpreter of romantic ballads but much of the material on this CD is truly mediocre and undeserving of being interpreted by an artist of Keith Washington's calibre. Granted, this CD does have its good moments but it's sad to think that Keith's producers did not give him better material."
5,Keith don't hurt nobody!,I love this CD and listen to it often. Between that voice and his attractiveness all I can say is Mr.Washington Im available Holla!
5,WOW! Fantastic!!!,"Washington has out done himself here, with his third release ""KW."" The Motown native takes on a bit of a ""subtly aggressive"" stance on his balladeering here, but with wonderful results. The entire album could be classified as a ""slow jam,"" but there are some peppier numbers as well. The melodies are very sweet, the harmonies smooth, and KW's voice is just plainly fabulous. Whether you want to get down or just rock your body from side-to-side a bit, this album has to be considered a modern classic and is definitely a must for any serious R&B enthusiast. 5 STARS easy."
2,A let down...,"When I bought this cd I was hoping for the magic of his first, very sexy, deep effort...Make Time for Love...but was extremely disappointed. I've listened to it numerous times and can't get through it totally. Over produced to the max! The songs aren't his best by far but his voice is still prime and hotter than ever. I'm still a fan though but get back to your earlier style please!"
2,dull plate,"Of the Lenox plates that we have, this one is the least attractive. The gold finches are almost the same color as the background."
3,Nose bridge is a bit small,Like this unit and would have recommended it more if there was more space between the glass and your eyes.
4,"Wisdom, grace and old world charm","This is a great book about what it's like to be older, not a terribly popular subject nowadays. This great man of letters, who could write like no other, describes his life after the passing of his wife. Now you really have to read this on Martha's Vineyard, where time ticks a little slower, where moments are savored a little more. Because all this book is in the details, the attentiveness to details. No grand statements, but gentle, keen observation of life that will really get under your skin if you allow it to. If you love dogs, this book will give you a subtle increase in the camaraderie of human/canine relationships. HBH is a man who is truly civilized, in that he lacks that spirit of selfishness and ego so prevalent today. A small forgotten masterpiece."
1,Defective camera,"The Canon S400, S410 and S500 have all had serious reliability problems. Read the reviews on this website and you will see that many customers have had a mysterious 'memory error' and/or the lens jamming (E18 error). These problems have shown up at about 18 months on all of these models. Since Canon hasn't fixed the problem in over 3 years since it first started showing up, I wouldn't want to bet that the new SD400 camera won't also turn into a paperweight after 18 months.Oh - I forgot to mention that Canon will 'fix' the cameras for $150. Nothing like turning a defective camera into a profit center."
2,colors are off,"I bought the camera to upgrade from a Canon A40 (3 Mega pixels) to this S500, and tested identical shots with both cameras. Sadly the older camera took much better pictures. The color on the Elph seemed faded. Tried their VIVID color option, and it over compensates for the color problem.Sadly, I'm returning the camera. Wish I knew what other micro digital camera to get instead. Maybe a Dimage X50?"
1,blurry photos,"When i first got this camera about 5 months ago, i loved iti even liked the little videos. AFTER 5 MONTHS I KEEP GETTING BLURRY PHOTOS. NEXT TIME I'LL BUY A FUJI CAMERA.CATHERINE FABRIZIO"
1,Extremely Poor Warranty Service,"A few months after I bought this camera, the compact flash door broke from normal use. I sent it in to get serviced and Canon has some very crazy policies about warranty work. They say that the CF door is ALWAYS the user's fault and costs $150.00 to fix. They also refuse to do any repairs unless you get EVERYTHING that they find wrong fixed. There was some kind of scuff on the lens housing and they wouldn't fix the CF door unless I got that fixed as well (which they of course classified as ""Impact Damage"" and you're back to paying the minimum service fee of $150.00).Don't buy Canon products unless you keep them in a sealed container and never use them, because if they break, you're out of luck."
1,E18 error,"I had this error after 14 months with this camera. I actually think this is a very good camera, it takes very good pictures and it's very friendly. I had an E18 error in my camera about a month ago. I sent it back to Canon Service, they gave me the option to replace it for a couple hundred dollars, but after looking at the reviews of the camera today, I just realized I'm not the only one with the same Error, I don't want to pay again in 14 months. I'll probably look for a different brand.Rolas"
5,wonderful camera,"A birthday gift for my daughter. Lots of great digital pictures were the result! Great quality pictures, the only minor problem was a loose on/off knob. It still works but requires more attention than it should. But still takes super quality pics...."
4,"As good as any comparable camera, if not better.","The top end of the S digital Elph series camera is now the s500. It is a great, reliable camera with excellent performance, especially compared with my old 230.Pro: Light, easy to use, has advanced feeatures if you are advanced, and reliable, decent battery life, and well recognized camera.Con: They still never have figured out the problems with the movie/manual settings/movie being so close together. Also the Shoot/play toggle is frequently found in the wrong position. Not smart enough to take nightime pictures and still see any lights. Still sluggish on startup.And the software? I never installed mine, and pitched the disc. I believe in iPhoto. However, I found ... uh ... movies stay on the camera unless you have the software. That would be nice. But they only let you download the update version. *Shrug* Guess its my fault. Now how do I fix it?"
1,It was ok while it was working,I took this camera to central europe last month and it was good while it worked. I dropped it from 3 feet and the mode switch stopped working. I couldnt preview / edit or delete pictures any more- I sent it to canon and they wanted to charge me $125 to repair it. I know it was my fault for dropping it but - shouldnt a camera be dropped once or twice without an important switch becoming useless?
2,"disgruntled, and embarrassed","I love Canon products. I love the zoombrowser software. I LOVED my S200 digital elph. So I upgraded..I bought 2 S500's, and had 3 friends buy one with me, (including my girlfriend). I am embarrased to say, the pics aren't very good. I am a photographer, and have tried every manual feature on this camera to try and improve the pictures. They rarily turn out sharp, and it is very hard NOT to wash the pics out with the flash (even with the pre-flash feature). The 5MP doesn't seem to matter. BTW, turn off the zone focus and go center weighted, the zone focus will drive you nuts picking the wrong subjects. I called canon, and they think I'm wrong, but I'm not. I have defended it to my unhappy friends- but not anymore. E-bay here I come... Anyone know of a good, compact digital camera?"
2,Great Disappointment,"This is my 4th digital camera, yet is the most disappointing one to date. I'm a big fun of Olympus products, but several things led to the purchase of this one:1. My wife just had a baby and needs an ultra-compact to carry around2. $50 rebate from Canon with a Pixma printer purchase which I recently made3. This camera's large CCD (1.8)4. This camera uses inexpensive but durable CF card vs. XD card of Olympus'ConsUncontrollable noisy level even at ISO 50 when shooting indoorHeavy purple fringe aberration in most indoor shotsSmall LCD (1.5"")Noisy AF operationNo battery life indicatorNo scene modeAF difficulty under low light even w/ AF laminator (AF Lock helps a little but annoying to use)ProsWell-constructed metal body, eye-pleasing good looksGood color balance and saturationAdequate flash powerGood video performance at highest settingGood battery lifeBottom LineIf you use your camera more than 50% for indoor shooting, stay away from Canon Elph line"
2,"Good construction, terrible shutter-lag","I bought this camera for my wife a year or so ago and generally have been pleased with the features and construction. The big problem with the camera is the long delay between when you press the shutter button and when it takes the picture. The camera is useless if you want to take pictures of dogs or kids, neither of which stay put long enough to take a decent shot."
5,Great things can come in small packages.,"The Canon engineers have truly outdone themselves. I work for a high end photo retoucher, and my boss could not believe the S500's amazing image quality.Sleek yet solid, the Canon S500 is the perfect little gadget to wow everyone. I never cease to be amazed on how they fit a 3x optical zoom lens and a great, fast image processor into such a small package. In fact, because the S500 is about the same size as an Ipod, it can fit into your shirt pocket or those neat Ipod clip cases.I highly recommend this wondrous camera to anyone who demands quality without compromising style."
2,Very fragile... breaks in a blink!!,"I bought the camera and love it... for 2 weeks. I fall off on the table while taking out the memory card... the fall was less than 1 feet and it broke. I know that the cameras need to be handle with care and I am sure I was very unlucky... whatever... but is the first time I see a camera broke that easily. Now I guess I will have to fight to get it covered by the warranty. In any event, I found the camera too fragile."
4,E18 Error / problem with the lens,"This is my second Canon digital elph camera. Both were great cameras. Recently upgraded to the S500. About 6 months later I get the dreaded E18 error. I searched the Internet and found numerous people having problems. When I determined the problem to be the lens not fully extending I decided to give it a tug. It clicked and the camera came on, ready to take pictures. Turning it off and on produced the E18 again. While turning it on I gave it a nice little bump on the side (where the USB connector is) and the lens popped out on its own. No problems since.Its a nice compact and light camera and takes great photos and videos. Only complaint (other than E18) is the limit of 30-second videos on 640x480 mode. I've got a 512MB compact flash card, I should be able to take as much footage as I have memory in one take."
2,sadly disappointed,"After having some of the most wonderful pictures and moments with my Power Shot S200 I decided it was time to upgrade. On a recent trip I took both the 200and the 500 just in case, in 9 out of 10 pictures the 200 took a far better picture. The 500's flash is so bright that it absolutely bleaches out the picture, the zoom is out of focus and as a result I turned it off and have been using the 200 ever since. In this particular case bigger is definently not better."
1,CLASS ACTION SUIT,1 year old... 3 e18 errors 2 battery erros shipped back for service 4 times! search the net for e18 before you buy!
4,At Madlib finest,I don't know what to say but good and if love jazz with some hip hop you'll most definitely love this cd.
3,fifty/fifty...,"i was wildly impressed with this for the first couple of tracks...and then just mildly impressed...and then i was like ""ehh, it's aight... ""the only problem for me was that all of the remixes began to sound the same to me... it felt like i was hearing madlib over-enforce his sound onto the original recordings and he began overshadowing the fantastic pieces he presented instead of rightly complementing them...and tho i truly like much of this, it's the 'UNTAINTED' version of these songs that has my head in the clouds...props to madlib tho... as a jazzfan, i thank him for his enthusiasm... i'm just glad to see true hip hop heads still lobbying for the cause of the jazz experience!peace."
3,"WHERE`S ""FOR THE GOOD TIMES""??","The omission of ""For The Good Times"" fosters my belief that most people who ultimately decide the song titles on an R&B compilation or major Soul artist box set are unqualified to do so. A weaker cover version of a ""Rock"" hit is more important in their eyes which tells me those individuals are Rock music fans as opposed to Soul. How about one of these so-called big white bread companies FOR ONCE hiring the right person to pick which tracks should be on an R&B or major Soul artist compilation. As a LONG TIME veteran of R&B Radio for many years, I know what I`m talking about.""For The Good Times"" was my MOST requested Al Green song in all the years on the air in several R&B radio outlets throughout the Southeast."
3,Scratched disks,"I bought and had to return this box twice. In both, all the CDs were scratched. A factory defect? Quality control slippage? Or, as I'm beginning to suspect, some genius at the record company had pushed to the extreme the idea of giving the box a feel of something old and well-worn? This is the case of the box package, with its false-old presentation of a shelf-worn book. Ok, why not. But to actually factory-scratch the disks to make them ""used"" - that's beyond me!A pity then, seeing that it's a great and very comprehensive collection, not that far from a ""Complete Al Green on Hi""."
5,Beautiful Set,"I purchased this set for our ranch house. The box is very impressive and weighs a ton. The tassled key is a nice touch. We have it sitting on a side table since it is so nice. It has sort of a satiny black finish. The chips feel great in your hand and, coupled with felt table top complete the 'casino' experience. All of our guests that have played with the chips were impressed. Compared to the price of some of the other sets on Amazon, I think this set is a bargain. I'm going to buy another set for my home."
2,"Just so, so","This set is just so, so. All the chips have a good color match, but they are all blank chips. The box has a nice color, but a hinge pin was missing (made in China). The cards are complete junk, so just toss them. I did not get my Texas-hold-em chips. The lock and key are a joke. So for the money and as an entry level set its just so,so."
2,disappointed,"I wasn't expecting much, but was still disappointed. The ""Mahogany"" is just black paint on particleboard with a lot of blemishes. Two inside parts were unglued when it arrived. After spending time picking out a set with the right selection of poker chips, what I recieved did not match the picture. I didn't come with the dealer or blind buttons.The chips are decent quality and the box is cetainly better than the flimsy silver case that cheaper sets come in.Don't go by the picture - just expect a black box and 500 random chips. There are several sets to choose from, buy on price and not options."
5,A Wonderful Set,"A wonderful box with velvet on the bottom. The key with tassel is a nice touch although the key isn't made out of the best material. The cards inside are garbage but the clay chips are absolutely beautiful. The slots have room to add more chips and there is enough space for 6 card decks underneath the tray. This is a definate steal for the price. There are no Dealer, Big Blind, or Little Blind markers as shown in the picture."
4,great box,"got this set for christmas - chips were pretty good, box is heavy & impressive. the box locks with a key, which we may lose & that would suck. looks like we may be able to pick the lock if necessary, but unfortunately the lock is needed because if picked up with one hand the box could open & spill the chips everywhere. but the wood the box is made from is very sturdy and we may be able to add a second lock later. the inner tray for chips will be handy for re-buys. all in all, a great set. yippie! thanks mom :)update, few months later - the hinges on the box broke, so now we just set the lid on the box. didn't hold up as well as i hoped :("
3,Pretty Interesting,"It was a pretty interesting read. I am not a Mormon, but I wanted to research some of their history. The book was originally published in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 1914. It is a very general summary of the church's early history, and there is a very clear bias in favor of the Mormon Church. Even though it's almost a hundred years old, I found it easy to read. It's very short, too. If you're interesting in reading Mormon history from a Mormon perspective, I would recommend it."
3,A long Brochure by the LDS Chief apologist,I agree that those looking into LDS should read this book. I am not a Morman and read this as one of six books to give me a picture of the sect. The author is often referred to in other books as a Mormon theologian so we have to expect the book to be biased. I was disappointed that he skipped so much of the historical facts but chose instead take only the Mormon point of view on events and glorify their actions.I do suggest reading this quick book but then read others such as Linn and Bowman histories.
1,Shouldn't be under Christianity,A book on mormonism shouldn't be included under Christianity. It should be located somewhere else. If you are interested in reading a book on mormonism from an unbiased viewpoint you should check out Under The Banner of Heaven.
3,Not a stand alone fish-eye.,"If you want a lens that attaches to your existing lenses, then this lens will satisfy to some extent. It is not a stand alone lens, and would work better with a 55mm lens. The optics appear to be good quality."
2,I didnt like it at all...,"I played around with it for a day and I returned it the next morning. If you are expecting a cool professional look of the wide angle/fish-eye lense, this is not the lense you're looking for... When I tried to take a picture at 18mm focal length (27mm eq) on my D50 it got that black vignette area covered about 50% of the picture... definitely not the cool effect...The Plus side is that the seller have no problem with the return... Their customer service is the best."
2,Adapter problems,"I would like to be able to use this lens but cannot find an adapter to fit my D200 lens. It should be clearly stated that this attaches to an existing lens, not into the camera body and additional adapters should be offered by Opteka (they do have some included but they are very small and do not fit a standard lens size)."
1,Not so pleased,"Blurry on the edges, heavy once connected to a 50mm, realy a cheap fish eye alternative that will deliver just that, mediocre results"
1,Disappointed in Dixie,"This book has nothing to do about succession issues in a family business. Instead, it makes trivial observations about marketing, management and book-keeping -- advice that few on-going businesses would have little use for...."
1,don't waste your time...,"As an advisor to business and entreprenuerial familes, I usually applaud everything published which heightens awareness of help and hope for family businesses. So it is difficult for me to say this, since I want to believe the Allred brothers intended to make a contribution to the advancement of family business continuity. But this is one of the few books in the field which I've read that simply fails to deliver anything much of value."
3,"Good, cheap flags.","I use these for high school and club volleyball, and they are fine.Nothing fancy, sometimes the flag comes loose and have to be stapled.You don't really want something expensive, since kids, being kids, can destroy your propertyfor no particular reason."
5,classier than the cost,The only week point is the lack of a big date feature... The rest is pure perfection!
4,"Works great, when attached to something","I attached mine to a scrap of plywood and clamp that to the table edge to secure. Once it's secured, it does a great job."
3,What does it say?,I might have bought this but you don't tell me anywhere on this page what the poster says below the word INTEGRITY.
5,Pumpkin Lover,"We originally checked this book out of the library 2 years ago. We immediately loved it and bought our own copy. This is a favorite with my daughters, ages 3 and 5. They will request it all year long. This is probably the best children's book I have ever read. The story is funny, enchanting, and I love the subtle lesson in it. The illustrations are perfect. We love Rebecca Estelle!"
4,Good book,This is a fun book to read with children. It talks about viewing nasty situations through positive eyes. My girls loved reading it so much when we checked it out at the library that we decided to purchase a copy.
4,Great book,This is a good book to share with kids in the Fall. I read this to my kids once and they were hooked. Ages 4-8 is right on target with this book. I did give this one as a gift to a five year old girl who has a birthday in the Fall and we were told that she loved it. When her parent's took her pumpking picking she kept talking about story in this book. My kids did the same.
5,Great for Teachers,"This book is great for harvest time. I use it in my pre-k classroom and the children love it, it is a great read!"
5,This is a great read aloud book in classrooms.,"I've used this book in my classroom for the past 10 years. The kids love hearing it, there are great literature extension activities that go along with it, and the illustrations are wonderful!"
3,"""Very Best"" depends on your music taste.","Describing this album as the very best is a little bit misleading. The hits are here and so too a lot of other songs spanning the Doobies career pre-early 1990's. I personally found the Doobies to be at their best on the album ""The Captain and Me"" (see my review), and I don't rate the post-Tom Johnston era Dobbies as terribly exciting. There is a good mix of songs from both era's here which is why I only gave the album three stars. But for those wishing to sample the Doobies collection this is a reasonable start. Personally I think the album ""The Captain and Me"" and any of the ""Best of"" albums are all the casual Doobies fan needs."
4,"Unfamiliar names, streets, and buildings.","The book Sex, Death and God in L.A. by David Reid(Editor) is a good book to read for L.A. The book has alot of great storys about Los Angeles how it came to be knowend as the melting pot of Califorina. Their are lots of variety of works in this book. The ones that I have read are great I am not just saying this because its part of the readings of our class no. The book has unfamiliar names, streets, districs, and buildings that I never new where there I went to explore to see if this names, streets, and buildings where still there and some were. I really enjoyed the book, great stuff."
3,A book with ruff vocabulary.,"The book Sex,Death and God in L.A. by David Reid (Editor) is a very difficult book to read. Judging on what I have read, I would not recommend it to just anyone with a low vocabulary. Although, the book does gives you the opportunity to learn new words. The vocabulary in this book is very structural. My vocabulary is not very strong, but by reading this book I have learned new words and more about Los Angeles. If you are into knowing more about Los Angeles and having a wonderful vocabulary, the book Sex, Death and God in L.A. is the way to go."
1,wish this toy worked,I have to agree with the other reviewers. This toy didn't do any of the things that it said it would. It played the same songs over and over. I sold mine for $3 at a garage sale. Good riddens!
3,"cute, I guess","This is a cute little thing. The head is really soft. It moves around even, on some settings, on some wheels it has underneath. Some of the tunes are cute to listen to and some too repetetive, but sometimes, in the middle of the night it will ""wake up"" and start singing to us out of nowhere and we have to go put it in the garage to get some sleep! If only there were an on/off switch it wouldn't be a problem. (That is annoying.) Also, you can only stack the rings on in the right order. No big dissapointments. Pretty cute little thing, and mostly cute sounds. (Just not at 3:00am.)"
4,fun little music maker,"fun toy that makes a wonderful gift as it is: colorful, loud, fun and larger than it looks in the photos. i got this on an amazon special for $5.00 and wish that i had bought more as they would have been wonderful gifts for all my daughter's 18 month old friends. this toy might scare a younger baby but any over 9 months to about 3 years would like this."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased two of these as gifts for children in the family. The box says you can make up to 125 different songs. Maybe it should read 10 different sounds. The toy seems to have a mind all its own. It makes noise rather your playing with it or not and it makes the same music over and over. We've tried rotating the rings, removing a ring and pressing on the head, all which the directions say will give you different results. No matter what it does the same thing over and over. I ordered other toys made by Shelcore and I would say about 3/4 of the toys I ordered made by this same manufacturer do not work."
1,Colorful...but not very musical,"This is a colorful stacking toy with a friendly stuffed ""face"" but not much more than that.It does play music, but as another reviewer mentioned it seems to play the same few songs over and over on its own schedule. It also does not dance or move along to its songs as the text on box seems to claim it will.I have this toy out for use by a group of 8 children and it hasn't held anyone's interest longer than a few minutes. It's headed for the Goodwill, unfortunately."
4,Not bad,"Overall, this is a fun toy. My two year old and seven month old both enjoy it. It moves around and makes a bunch of noises and such. A previous customer wrote that they were disappointed because it doesn't make different combinations of music as billed in it's description. They are right, it doesn't. It will just make the same noises over and over again. Which is why it didn't get 5 stars from me. But it's still a fun toy anyway."
1,SCARY!,"This toy has scared the crap out of every kid it comes into contact with! Its ok at first, but it starts moving around, and its kinda scary. I bought it for my 2 year old a few Christmases ago, and cant find anyone to give it to because no one likes it! LOL"
