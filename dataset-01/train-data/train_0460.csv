5,The best opera magazine for Americans,"I've been a subscriber to Opera News for almost forty years. (Now THAT's a sobering thought!) And indeed it is the opera-lover's best friend. There is always a lot going on in the opera world, over and above the performances themselves. And Opera News is a great place to keep up. Of course, it focuses primarily on the Metropolitan Opera and in particular the the Saturday afternoon broadcasts (I'm listening to a delectable 'Don Giovanni' as I write this--'La ci darem la mano').And for people who are new to the world of opera it is easily the best periodical for easing them into this admittedly difficult (at first) art form. The price is terrific, too.If you've hesitated before, now's the time!"
3,good magazine,why should anything more have to be said about a longstanding periodical that does its job? someone needs to fix this minimum word requirement.
5,"Opera News -- brilliant gossip, but . . .","This magazine is one I read cover to cover every month. Allowing for the fact that it's the Met Opera's megaphone to hype its productions, it's great writing all the same. There's a fair amount of gossip, but thoughtful musical commentary and criticism as well."
3,Great fun and excitement.,"Movie sequels don't often do better than the original. But WRATH OF KHAN is a faster-paced action-adventure movie. Ricardo Montalban reprises his role of Khan, a 20th Century genetically-altered superman who moved to the 23rd Century via cryogenics. Khan failed to take over the Earth and is now trying to take over the galaxy.Enter also David Marcus, the bastard child of Kirk. (You know this had to happen with Kirk sleeping around the way he did in the series) There's a lot of father/son tension that doesn't work here.No, what makes this movie work are all the space battles. They really are exciting, but...That's not STAR TREK! STAR TREK was not about hardware and special effects. Strike Two to Paramount for still not realizing what the franchise really is."
3,One of better Star Treks,"Though this is not a great movie, it is much better than the first Star Trek, and it fills a gap in my Star Trek collection. The story is well told, and the cinemtography is very good. I enjoyed seeing it again and will enjoy watching it occasionally in the future."
2,Defective Products Disappoints,"I was very disappointed in this because of technical problems.""Wrath of Khan"" is one of the best Star Trek movies. However, the first copy I received of the director's edition and the replacement were defective in the same ways. The movie skipped forward 10 minutes and the bonus features DVD would not play.These problems were identical on both copies, pointing to a manufacturing problem since I have not experienced this problem on other DVDs I own.Someday, I'll try to order it again and then maybe I can see and review all of the extras I had hoped to see."
2,Get the VHS version.,"The Director's Edition was, overall, very disappointing. Although the rextras were nice, it would have been great to get more than one trailer. I do, however, take issue with the transfer to DVD of the feature itself.It's blocky. It's grainy. Watch the VHS release (the one in the box set, where you could see the Enterprise if you lined all 6 tapes up) if you don't believe me. The picture is much smoother and finished looking. The additional scenes were nice though, but I've noticed they changed the timing and pace sometimes. Overall, the VHS beats the widescreen DVD.The movie itself is the best in the entire series and should be included in film courses at college so it remains part of our collective heritage.So go...and see if you can track down an older copy. Or wait for paramount to releease yet another version of the movie on DVD. This is for die-hard Trekkers only."
1,DVD release rates a zero for effort.,"The Wrath of Kahn is one of my favorite Star Trek movies. The producers of this DVD felt that they were doing you such a HUGE favor by providing a Wide Screen version of the film that they have provided NOTHING ELSE. There are no cast bio's, no production notes, no ""making of"" featurette, no director comentary, nothing. The printed material rises to the same low standard, poviding only the minimal rehashing of the DVD's chapter list and a sales pitch for this wonderfull ""Priced to Own"" DVD series. If you check the asking price for this ""priced to own"" DVD, and consider the vintage of the film involved, you will see that you are paying for the ""extra features"" (they just aren't there). All in all, I would say this DVD would be a bargan at HALF the price. Since Star Trek fans are collection oriented, I expect that we will soon see an improved ""Collectors Edition"" at substantiallay the same price, so, until then, don't waste your money."
4,Star Trek 2 makes the original series come alive,"Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan on a HD TV... wow!!It brings back memories of sitting in the movie complex watching this on the big screen. It was excellent movie... great script of revenge.Paramount don't remake this movie with the new crew.Additionally, if Paramount is reading this review... this is the kind of movie which makes it great. Paramount should be ashamed of an eposide from TNG from the first season where the parasites enter into the body. You never continued that eposide or expanded on it. Shame!"
2,Manufacturing Problems Crash Wrath of Khan,"I was delighted when I received the director's edition, but utterly dismayed when the second straight copy I received was defective.The movie DVD skipped 10 minutes and the extras DVD would not play at all. This was returned and Amazon quickly (kudos to Amazon) sent a replacement. Unfortunately, this defective in exactly the same way. The problem is not with my DVD player since I've had no similar problems with other DVDs and these problems were in exactly the same place.Someday I hope to receive this director's edition again so I can write a real review of the DVD edition of what is one of the best Star Trek movies.P.S. I regard Nemesis, the new one, as one of the worst."
4,"5-STAR FILM, 4-STAR DVD!","This movie is incredible! A great addition to the ""Star Trek"" franchise. The new Director's Cut on Disc 1 is even more dramatic than the original cut. The extras on disc two are good, but for some reason they don't seem as compelling as the features for the ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" Director's Edition DVD. But they are still worth it! A great DVD edition! Movie Grade: A+; DVD Grade: B+"
4,This is the only Star Trek movie I own,"I really enjoy the Star Trek movies but, this has to be my favorite. I grew up watching the Star Trek series and I think this one is true to the series. I am not a Trekie but, I would recommend this movie for the Sci-Fi lovers out there."
5,Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan,"After a sluggish, bloated first ""Star Trek"" movie, director Meyer steers the franchise back to more familiar and exciting territory with this entry. The gang's all here, and Shatner's particularly good as a more seasoned, philosophical Kirk. Montalban seems to enjoy playing the venomous Khan as much as we do watching him. Hit warp speed, and catch this lively, family-friendly science fiction adventure."
3,Marginal Improvement,"I was so looking forward to this dvd. But I was very disappointedwhen I finally got this dvd. The parts they added were the onesthey put in the version that put in the version they showed on T.V. So if you already have a copy of this movie on dvd don'tbuy this. But if you don't already have a regular copy,then buythis version. It is a marginally better than the first version.The special features on disc-2 are ok but not great but interesting."
5,Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,This was one of my favorite Star Trek movies ever. The DVD came right on time and in perfect condition. The picture looks great and the quality is great.
4,Why won't Paramount give us extra features?,"I would pay good money for the additional scenes that used to air with the ABC broadcast of this movie. As another reviewer said, they go a long way toward explaining some of the stuff that fell kinda flat in the theatrical release. Also, why not dig up Nick Meyer and a couple cast members, and give us some audio commentary? Come on, Paramount, use the format to it's fullest extent!As a film, though, Star Trek II just rocks. And the DVD transfer looks and sounds good, even if it is a bit lacking in other features."
3,Even Non -Star Trek fans can enjoy this one,"Even those viewers who dislike Star Trek about as fervently as Trekkies love the show can enjoy this episode in the movie series... I have never liked Star Trek, not even when I was a young kid, but I have to admit that this stirring adventure movie had me thrilled. This is the only ST movie that I would recommned to the casual viewer, it combines human drama with interesting special effects and (for once) interesting characters...I will definately be adding this to my DVD collection"
4,KHAN!!!,"It's nice to see all the classic Star Trek movies on DVD. They look and sound great, but now I wish I'd held out for the Blu-ray versions."
3,Perhaps the most overrated of the series,"After being blown away by the sheer size and scope of Star Trek:The Motion Picture (yeah I loved it), this film was a step downward in quality. Yes this film ""moves along"" faster than Star Trek I. Yes, it has more action sequences than Star Trek I. What it did not have is the sense of wonder that came with the fascinating story in Star Trek I. Add to that the incredibly cheesy acting (especially Ricardo Montalban's performance who has mastered the art of the big sigh as an acting tool. Yawn) and you have a decent film, but not a great film.Ok, so I am in the minority here probably with this opinion, but hey I'm used to that.My recommendation is to watch this film and see for yourself. I feel that Star Trek IV is better than this one (very light hearted, more on the human side) Star Trek I is still king in my book."
5,The best what else to say,This movie is great the DVD does this movie the justice it deserves. Truly the music makes this film the great that it is and the DVD experiance really helps to bring you into the show.Not a bad thing to say here.
2,Great Movie - Horrible Transfer!,"This is probably my favorite ST movie. Ricardo plays a great role and this is a great 'tactical' battle that holds a lot of suspense. Unfortunately the transfer to DVD is one of the worst that I have seen and heard. The transitions in the movie are crude and the quality is only ok, at best. The audio portion would rate in the negative scale. Switching from 5.1 to Dolby produced no difference, it sounds like it was recorded underwater."
3,Yet another disappointing Paramount release.,"A wonderful movie, acceptable transfer, but overall a mediocre DVD. Paramount, yet once again, provides a premium DVD without the extras we've become accustomed to--deleted scenes, director commentary, behind the scenes, etc. All the more surprising in this case, since it's well known that ABC ran an extended-length version of this movie, featuring Scotty's nephew, in the 1980s. Paramount should get a clue from the X-Files releases (including the movie), rather than simply milk a loyal fan base."
2,"Good sound, but images blued-over","I was glad to see Paramount re-released this movie on DVD since the original print from 2000 was out of production. After watching this new version against previous releases, I'm somewhat disappointed. The sound quality is excellent, you can again hear the people speaking in Engineering during the first attack. But that's overshadowed by the over-use of the blue color-tint: everything seems to have been made more blue. Check out the white pieces of the uniforms, they look blue. The ship looks more blue. The biggest impact was on Regulus - the brown moon is now blue. I checked this against multiple TVs and DVD players, and got the same result. I'm not sure what they did or whether this is considered ""enhanced"". Good to have another copy, but disappointed in the color changes."
4,Practice Makes - Almost Perfect,"'Star Trek' is a cult phenomenon. That statement alone would often drive away serious film buffs, but 'Star Trek II' transcends the archtype 'Saturday Matinee' film cliche. The first 'Trek' movie was super-ambitious, and was on a studio release time table that caused some very important elements of the original release to be left on the cutting room floor. Montalban is brilliant. Nimoy is brilliant. Shatner is (unusually for him) on-the-mark. I cried the first two times I saw this movie. The new edit restores some emotional relevance to the film as a whole. Rent it. Buy it. Unless your heart is made of stone, you won't be disappointed."
4,Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan,"This movie is a complete opposite of Star Trek: The Motion Picture. It has an interesting plot, a interseting villian, and a whole lot of action. This is one of my favorite Star Trek films. The writers really brought me into the movie. They created a movie that actually felt like I was on board the Enterprise. In all, it was a fantastic film. And a brief SPOILER ALERT for those who haven't seen this movie yet, Spock dies. It was painfull to see it happen but adds extreme drama to the movie even though the scence was at the end. And always fellow reviewers and Trekkies, live long and prosper."
3,More like DVD on a Blu-ray Disc? Restored?,"The movie itself is an all time classic without doubt and deserves a full 5/5 stars.My review is about the Blu-ray version of this movie. What happened? It truly looks more like a DVD (if not slightly upscaled even) than the Blu-ray sharpness I've come to know. Many of the scenes even appear almost out of focus. Something either went wrong during transfer or they did not use a proper, original source. And I've seen too many much older movies on Blu-ray that look like they were filmed yesterday for anyone to tell me that the problem here is the fact that it's an older movie. Hogwash.If you don't own the DVD (I didn't), then at this price, it is worth grabbing on Blu-ray - but I would doubt that it is worth upgrading to if you already own the DVD.My question is: What was restored?"
3,Even less than the VHS Release,"I'm not a Trekkie I'm a movie buff and StarTrek II is one of my favorite movies, however this DVD release is very disappointing. Not because of such things as picture quality and sound (which were great) but because scenes were deleted from the DVD release that were in the VHS version, let's not even talk about the ABC footage. With the DVD format one can expect extra features such as director commentary, film trailers, 3 versions of a movie (as is the case with the newly released Terminator II) , even scenes that did not appear in the original theatrical release but one does not expect scenes to be cut from the movie.I will be sending Paramount this DVD back for a refund because when I buy a movie I expect the whole movie."
4,Amazing,"Watching this movie made me a fan, although not a trekkie, of the Star trek series. Within this movie we find an internal struggle and outward struggle between Khan and Kirk. An intresting plot line that continued for two more movies afterwards. A great start to a trilogy of movies in a series of Star Trek movies!"
4,Good. Good. Good. Bad.,"Second best Star Trek ever. The reason I gave it four stars is because Chekov wasn't in the first Khan episode. Also, it was a good movie, lasted a good time, had good action. It was basically all good."
2,Almost as bad as JJ Abrams' Star Trek,"Star Trek: II The Wrath Of Khan is easily the most over-rated of all the Trek movies. Ricardo Montalban replaces the frightening believability of his Khan in the Space Seed TV episode, all restrained intellectual and physical energy, with hammy, scenery chewing bravado. Instead of the majestic and ambitious 2001-esque Star Trek: The Motion Picture, with it's so Roddenberry-esque tale of different life forms communicating, understanding and actually combining, we have big spaceships firing laser weapons at each other and plenty of boring running, jumping and falling down - if TMP had the ambition to take Kubrick as it's model, WOK settled for the considerably inferior Lucas. Even the - admittedly VERY moving - Spock death scene means absolutely nothing, because he's back in the next one.If you prefer George Lucas to Stanley Kubrick, you'll love it.Mind you, compared to the horror that was JJ Abrams' movie, it's a masterpiece. But then again, so are most movies."
4,Wait for Blu-ray re-release!,"The 2002 standard DVD ""Director's Cut"" is 116 min.. The 2009 blu-ray was deliberately DOWN-GRADED to 112 min. of the original DVD length. Presumably the studios wish to double-squeeze us in a few years for the 116 min. ""re-release"" of blu-ray director's cut. Encourage all to speak out via withholding our purchases and buying something else on Amazon as the studios are manipulating us and our ""voice"" is heard via our pocketbook. The 2012 version of 116 min. will be significantly better than the current 112 min. scam!The film is the best Star Trek of all time, much better than the current garbage Star Trek film w. the new offensively illogical timeline in which cadet Kirk suddenly commands the flagship, Spock has the ability to travel in time but elects not to reverse the genocide of his planet, and a future Romulan w. 30 years of advanced technology elects not to save his planet from genocide in favor of attacking Spock."
5,Love this movie,This is my favorite movie if the original Star Trek crew. It's smart and very much like the original series. Ive watched it dozens of times. It's fabulous!
5,Best of the Star Trek films,"Boy, it's nice to see the original crew in all their glory. Still in good shape, at the height of their acting powers.Star Trek II has action, intrigue and a nice tip of the hat to the original series featuring the old villain, Khan, played by Ricardo Montalban. I hadn't seen this film in years when I bought the DVD and I was amazed at how well the special effects held up. We've become a bit spoiled with digital effects these days and it's nice to see that we weren't just kidding ourselves when we thought the effects in films like Star Trek II and Aliens were good. They are!ST II is one of the more heart-wrenching of the Trek films as well. For those two or three of you out there who haven't seen it or know about it, I won't spoil the ending.The DVD's special features, while not plentiful, are good. And the reproduction is top notch. I highly recommend this version of the film."
5,Star Trek II Rocks,I own this movie and it is the best out of all of them. It is about a man named Khan (we first met him in Episode 24 of the orignal series its name is Space Seed). Who wants Revenge against Kirk for marooning him on Ceti Alpha 5. He takes Chekov as his slave and the battle starts. By the way this is Kristie Alley's (Cheers)first movie as she plays Lt. Savik. It is a great movie with a Surprising ending.
4,Star Trek II - Blu,"I love the movie, the best Star Trek movie in the series for me, the audio/video quality on Blu-Ray is pretty good, the best transfer I've seen. I have the 116 minute long version of this movie on DVD but what about on Blu-Ray, where is it? That's the one I want and that's the one I've been waiting for. I always thought that Blu-Ray has more storage space than DVD. Please Paramount, release the 116 minute version of Star Trek II on Blu-Ray. By the way, I love the new cover on Blu-Ray, it looks excellent !!!"
5,Paramount saves money again: No special DVD features,"With the sole exception of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, Paramount has been notoriously skimpy in providing any special DVD features in Star Trek releases. And in some respects, why should they -- after all, we're just dumb Star Trek fans who will buy whatever they put out, regardless of the quality.I had hoped that for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn, perhaps the best of all the Star Trek movies, and certainly the most exciting and visually stimulating, Paramount would have looked beyond the balance sheet and issued something that they could be proud of and fans would snatch up.But I guess since this is the best of all the Star Trek movies, they felt even less reason to give us something extra. Thanks for nothing Paramount -- great way to engender bad feelings towards a movie studio."
2,Not what I expected,"The blu ray transfer was not as good as I expected. I couldn't really tell any difference from the standard dvd. Also it is the shorter version of the movie, not the director's cut. This is arguably the best STAR TREK movie and really should've been given a stellar upgrade."
1,This DVD release is missing footages!,"1. This print really requires a good digital video and audio cleanup.2. This release has bits of dialog missing which even the television release had for example:- McCoy asks his ""Vulcan friend"" in whose hands would the Genisis device would be the ""right hands""?-During an inspection of the ship, Scotty's nephew says that Kirk would be blind as a bat, if he can't see that the ship is in top condition.- Scotty thanks Doctor McCoy for his efforts to save his nephew..."
2,Cheap,"Worst HD transfer I've ever seen. Plus the disc wouldn't even play until I scratched the paint off the backside that had adhered from sitting on another disc. You can see right through the disc too. But mostly, there are two bridge scenes where everyone seems to have one side of their faces 20 shades darker than the other. Looks muddy."
2,Not the Director's Cut,I wish I had paid attention to these reviews a little closer because I would not have ordered this knowing it was NOT the Director's Cut.
1,Pure Kid's Movie,"I can't believe 10 years old (or higher) people could enjoy movies like this. I seriously wonder what kind of people ""Trekkies"" are."
3,Khan is Back!!!,"This is a pretty good sequel! Khan is back and wants revenge for what Kirk did to him in the past. Khan also wants to control the Genesis planet. Genesis is a living planet that brings life. Will Kirk and the Enterprise crew be able to stop him? If you are a Trekkie, you'll love STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN!!!"
5,"""the good of the many out weight the needs of the few,or the one"" spock","this is the one,the one that saved the series and made the other shows possible.after the boxoffice hit of the first one,they roled out this second,and much cheeper budgeted second one and hit gold!acting like the first one never happened,this one starts with cadets training to take over the ship and kirk is going on the training run with them. enter khan(ricardo montalban as the villian he played on the original show) a superman from the past that kirk beat and left on a far off world. it seems that starfleet has a new weapon,the genesis weapon,it turns dead planets into live ones,killing everything to make the world able to suport life. the planet khan is on is to be used as a test site.khan takes control of the ship sent for the test and goes after the bomb and kirk! the action comes fast and gets better as the movie goes on.the dvd is great and has all the extras you could want. a great set,beam it up!!!"
5,Simply the Best,"I'm a trekkie from way back. My favorite episode was the one with Khan - so it might not be any surprise that ST2-Khan is my favorite of the ST movies. The thing is though - even so - it still is the best movie. It's simple, it's got action, it's got camp, seriousness, excitement and yes, things get blown up!Lots of great characters. I happen to like Judson Scott (was in the TV Series, The Phoenix). He's not even named in the credits - but he's Khan's right-hand man who gets killed - this movie's famous ""no name character who always seems to get killed"") I'd have bought this movie just for him! But no need - I loved this movie right from the start before I knew he was in it!A young Kirstie Alley is here as well.Even if you aren't a Trek fan - you could love this movie!"
2,Small budget Star Trek.,"ST2 is an enjoyable adventure marred by a miniscule budget.The budget was so small that they re-used effects from the first film,used a television film crew,re-used the bridge set 3 different times for different ships and didn't have the money to finish the Eden Cave effect which was over-exposed.The ship's power source(which Spock repairs)looks like a giant salt shaker on a disco dance floor,hardly the large power source that it should have been,due to the tiny budget of 3 and a half million dollars(the real budget reported at the time).On the plus side,the battle scenes are eccellent,although the nebula looked a little fake at times,and the Kirk/Spock/McCoy interactions are fun the watch.After the slow STTMP,it was good to see the relationships and humour re-ignited on ST2.Nicholas Meyer's direction is good and the music by James Horner is a highlight.So,if you like an entertaining B-grade film then ST2 will entertain you."
5,Best [Star Trek] Movie Ever!,"This is arguably the best movie ever. It is certainly ranked among the top SciFi films of all time, and it's by far the greatest Star Trek film of all time (no offense to J.J. Abrams).I recommend watching ""Space Seed"" from Season 1 of the original series before sitting down for this one. If you're not a Star Trek fan, this movie should have you hooked, or you can't claim to be a SciFi fan either."
5,"Fergit the rest, try the best",All the other Star Trek films (including the recent reboot) are thin soup compared to this film. Nuff said.
4,"Could have been five with ""Space Seed""","While any Trekker worth their weight in Tribbles will make this purchase a no-brainer, it would have been even more valuable with the original ""Space Seed"" episode on the bonus disk."
5,Far and away the best of the lot!,"Paramount got it right once, and then never again. The story has what you would want from Star Trek: A simple, understandable plot. A philosophical discourse between McCoy and Spock. Tense, well paced, and it ended well.The special effects and costuming neither overwhelmed the film (as in Star Trek 1) nor were they lacking in any way. The acting was subdued when it needed to be, and over the top (Khan) when it had to be.It even managed to avoid being cutesy or self-conscious the way later Treks seemed to be. If you want to introduce someone to Star Trek, this is the one to do it with."
4,"""HE TASKS ME!!! HE TASKS ME!!!!!!!""","The Movie I give five stars no doubt. It was and still is the best Trek movie yet made. The DVD though, is not exemplary. The picture is extremely detailed and clean but overall is a bit on the dark side. This DVD is best seen in a room with the lights off. The sound, Dolby Digital 5.1, is not very dynamic. This is not the fault of the crew who upgraded the soundtrack but rather it is this way because of the age of the movie. The soundeffects for the lasers and photon torpedoes emphasized treble rather than base, and for most of the movie Horner's score surpasses the sound effects. The only time you hear and feel the base is when the starships pass by."
3,Better than STTMP -- but that's faint praise.,"Although the movie had its good points, I subtract 2 stars for the ridiculous space battle that has the two starships tacking and maneuvering like the Bonhomme Richard going up against the Serapis. There hasn't been a sillier pseudo-sea-battle-in-space since that Original Series episode where the Romulan ship and the Enterprise engage in a destroyer/submarine duel."
3,Good but not the best in the series,"Even though STAR TREK 2 may not be the best in the series but it certainly remains the closest to the original. Good effects and nice direction manage to please not only trekkys but maybe also the small frie. Ricardo Montalban is great as Khan, an evil villain who Kirk and the crew try to kill off"
5,The perennial Trek Film,"Without a doubt the best of the Star Trek films franchise. I have watched Star Trek for over 20 years, and I have yet to find a film that captures the true essence of Trek like TWOK. William Shatner, my favorite actor of all time, puts in his usual charismatic and Patton like performance, as well as dealing with the death of his closest friend, which emulates a feeling of empathy with Trek fans. The battle scenes are fantastic, Montalban as Khan is a magnetic character that remains arguably the best Trek villain ever. If you are a Trek fan, or a non-Trek fan who likes Sci Fi, or action adventure, TWOK is a must see, buy it, you will love it!"
5,Don't mince words... tell us what you really think...,"Okay, I will. Star Trek II is the best of the movies. It's better than three quarters of the original series episodes. It's better than 90% of the Next Generation and Deep Space Nine episodes. Don't even get me started on Voyager, that blight on the good name of Star Trek.This film has all the Star Trek elements that made Trek good and the ones that made it fun too. Yes, Shatner and Montalban overact but admit it, you wouldn't have it any other way."
5,The BEST Star Trek movie ever made!,"This movie is GREAT! With Khan back from the Star Trek: The Original Series, he once again battles with Capt. Kirk. The Genesis device was helpful for the storyline which pitted Kirk against his archnemesis Khan. Full of riviting action, this movie is a must for any Star Trek fan!"
2,Slow and Too Many Twist,"I think reading the novella first in ""Lover Beware"" ruined this book for me b/c the Ms. Wilks changed the story in this book. Also, the book was slow and had too many twist. I didn't even finish the book. I was bored, and donated it to the library. The same was true for ""Mortal Danger"", the sequel. I can't explain it, but it was boring and just too slow for me."
1,Terrible,"The plot was boring, the dialogue was cheesy, the characters were flat as a board. I've read my share of bad paranormal books but this one takes the cake. Stay away."
2,loosing faith in vampire literature,literature and i use the term lightly. poorly written and the only saving grace was the characters. liked the hero but the main heroine needed work. what can i say. nothing...
1,Couldn't finish it,"This book was not worth finishing...bland, bland, bland. Not a world I plan on visiting again. Like this review, the dialog was rather disjointed. No spark...just not worth the effort to find out the end of the story (and I'm pretty frugal so hate wasting my money). Doesn't do much more than bring about a feeling of apathy...not even worth hating and certainly not worth beginning let alone finishing."
5,Tempting Danger,"I found it a little slow to start, but by the third or fourth chapter, it really got rolling. I then found the book very hard to put down. I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series."
5,Good book,started off a little hesitant with this book but ended up loving it at the characters. Didn't want it to end and can't wait to read the next book in the series.
5,Why did I wait so long?!,"I love this book!! I stayed away from the series because I read a review about the cat and Rule fighting over the right to bed Lily. Ugh, I didn't want to read a book like that. But, Tempting Danger, kept popping up in my recommends. So I caved and damn I'm glad I did. The whole scene with the cat and Rule wasn't sexual at all!!! Anyone who has a pet understand the constant control ""macho"" issues. But whew having said all of that I love the relationships introduced in the book. Lily and Rule are awesome together. And what a surprise Grandmother turned out to be!!! Can't wait to read the next one."
4,Tempting Danger,"When a murder victim is identified as being killed by one of the lupi, Lily Yu, a police detective, finds herself ordered to give primary focus to that case. To find what she needs, she must gain the wolf clan's acceptance, and Rule Turner is the key to doing that. Though it goes against police ethics regarding conflict of interest, Lily and Rule's relationship moves from business to beyond pleasure, making the case personal and doubly dangerous.**** Suspense and passion will keep you flipping pages rapidly until the end comes too soon. Readers will be glad to know this is only the first in a series focusing on Lily and Rule. Ms Wilks has crafted a new world of urban fantasy that will appeal to Laurrell K Hamilton and Melanie Jackson fans. Combining Indian and Oriental culture with her own version of the werewolves has resulted in a series that has depth from the get go. ****"
4,Tempting Danger,"Checking out a new author is always scary, but this book was pretty good. I enjoy the wolf half of the story and have already purchased book two to continue the story."
4,Glad I gave it a try!,"I thought it was a great story with very interesting characters. Lily is an Asian-American Detective and Rule is the ""Prince"" of the local werewolf tribe. They're brought together to solve a murder that seems to be caused by a group trying to frame Rule and ultimately destroy all werewolves. Rule and Lily are actually ""Chosen."" Apparently this is something that rarely happens in the werewolf community, where the ""Lady"" herself chooses mates for each other.The story is a sweet romance with lots of action to boot. My only complant was that I found a few slow parts that were difficult to follow what they were talking about."
5,The Beginning of Lily and Rule,"This is the start of Lily and Rule and I loved it. I think Wilks' worldbuilding and Lupi culture is unique and fresh and fascinating.Lily is a homicide cop, a woman and she's got a secret - she's a sensitive. Rule Turner is a skirt chasing werewolf prince. When they meet it's instant attraction but I loved that Wilks makes us wait for the eventual consummation and didn't have Lily just accept her chosen status immediately.The mystery, which unfolds further through the next two books, is intriguing and well done as is the action and the chemistry is incredible.I love it when fated mate stories are handled right, Wilks has done that and leaves me wanting more."
3,Not enough world-building,"This is pretty much your run-of-the-mill paranormal romance. Lily is human, for the most part. She does have some psychic powers. Rule is not only a werewolf, he's the prince of the local dominant pack. Of course, sparks fly, and angst ensues.There is one major flaw. I felt that you're thrown into the story a bit suddenly. The book opens with the murder scene, and there you are in the middle of everything with very little world-building. It took me several chapters to feel like I had a handle on the world and its various creatures and politics. I was so confused I actually checked to make sure this was indeed the first book in the series. This meant it took me that much longer to connect with the characters.Overall, it wasn't a bad read, it just could have been better. I'm sure I'll read more in the series."
4,"Good series, unanswered questions","In most supernatural stories, the author clearly describes the universe. For example, it could be just like this one, except there are vampires. In this novel, there are still a lot of unanswered questions about the world in general, and the characters in particular.That said, the action is enjoyable, the characters are interesting, the writing alternates between descriptive and direct, and it makes you want to read more. Luckily, there are at least three other novels in the World of the Lupi, which will hopefully be as good as the first."
4,Confusing but amusing!,I enjoyed this book after I got a ways into it. Although I've read other books along this line it took me a while to really get into it. Then I liked it very much. If you are reading her work for the first time be sure to have a dictionary close by. Some of the wording and references went right over my head. After I started understanding it more I found it was extremely enjoyable. Have fun!
4,Outstanding paranormal fantisy,"Lily is a detective who in the course of investigating a homocide meets Rule the hear to the leadership of the Nokolai Lukoi (PC for werewolves). The werewolves have just become accepted as full citizens although it is still legal to kill them in wolf form. Good characters including old ones (ex gods) one of who wants to destroy the Nokolai. Nicely done alternate world including snotty gnomes, evil sorceresses, LIly's grandmother who is a power, and nicely drawn characters. One brief erotic scene but this is a paranormal adventure mystery romance not erotic romance. Outstanding read and I highly recommend reading this series in order."
5,"More than HD TV - Crisp Images, easy hook up.","I decided to upgrade my old 25 in. Toshiba to the JVC AV32DF74 32. I paid $700.00 at Video Only in Dublin CA and only have had the unit a couple of days. The TV is well designed for easy connection hook up. I was surprised how well the images were. Even standard network TV images look much sharper, more clear and color is great. I am using my standard Toshiba DVD player, not progressive, and images are very sharp. I highly recommend this TV if you can get it for around $700."
4,A WHALE OF A TIME!,"Not the loyalist of the Star Trek films, it is decidely humourous, and easy on the eyes. Her of the marine biology (now on 7th Heaven with ex-Trekker Steven Collins), adds a new dimension to the Star Trek series - someone from the past now joins the future! Her single-mindedness fits right in to the 23rd century as we are to see it. Keystone slapsticks are made to fit, and ""late 20th century"" issues are paraded with an undignified parody. Perhaps best with Junior Mints and buttered popcorn mixed together."
3,Greatly overrated.,"Here's just one example of overreaching to get a laugh: Scotty's mistaking a mouse for a microphone to be used in talking to the computer. Would he really be that ignorant of early computer technology? If you went back in time and saw an early typewriter, would you look for the electric cord or the disk drive? The point I'm getting at is that the humor was contrived. There were good moments in the film (Kirk and Gillian in the pizza parlor, for example). But there were also many heavy-handed moralistic moments regarding the whales, along with the aforementioned forced humor. So 3 stars is about the most I can give it."
3,This movie isn't logical.....,"I am a big Trek fan, and I loved the other movies (especially ""Star Trek: The Movie"", with V'ger), but the story of ""Star Trek IV"" is just plain stupid.I mean, ut was pretty entertaining to see our beloved Admiral James T. Kirk shout ""Double Dumbass on you!"" at a car driver, but again, the story...""We have just come back from a tiring journy to Genesis and then to Vulcan, and we are flying our way back to earth, but oh wait! We have to make a quick stop at the 20th century to bring back a couple of Humpback Whales to save the planet from an alien whale race...""I'm sorry, this is not the Star Trek style I love so much, so does splashing in the waters of San-Francisco after returning home...If you are new to this whole Star Trek thing, don;t let this movie fool you. Star Trek is a wonderful series of movies (and a TV serise) full of intersting storylines and characters, but this one is just plain silly.."
4,Good Trek,"That the series took a comedic turn with Star Trek IV is well known, though the 80s-style humor seems a bit forced and dated now (punk rocker, Russians, etc.). Nimoy's second turn at directing is more imaginative than his first Trek, even if this one suffers occasionally from stock characters and a case of the ""cutes."" Star Trek IV delivers on most fronts--good dialogue, decent special effects, competent acting. The plot is recycled sci-fi: Kirk and crew timewarp to save Earth from a menace that's never quite explained or explored. Along the way, they deliver a heavy-handed message about ecology and have some misadventures. Leonard Rosenman's asymetric score will make you pine for Goldsmith and Horner, and Catherine Hicks is at times grating and juvenile, but there's some genuine warmth here. Widescreen also makes this look like a movie, rather than a big TV show. Basically completes a story that took three films and five years to finish."
5,IV is Fun!,"Sit back and just enjoy the ride!This Trek is so much fun I have talked to non-followers of Trek and they love this one!I can see why.Best scene is in hospital with Dr. McCoy and 20th century medicine(""My God man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer!"").Spock trying to fit in by cursing is by far the funniest comic relief in any trek(""Admiral, the use of language has altered since our arrival."") One of the other things that I like about this Trek vehicle is the excellent continuity.It is a bonafide sequel to Trek III-Search For Spock.Nothing is forgotten. Kirk and company still have to return to earth and face court martial for violations of Starfleet regulations.Whale special effects are incredible as well.Kudos to Nimoy for an outstanding directorial effort."
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!,This movie was well done. Its funny seeing how everyone tried to blend in the 80s. This movie is worth watching. I recommend all TREK fans to watch this awesome film.
5,Star Trek IV,Received program on time and in exc condition. This is as expected and the Movie was a replacement for the original which I had dropped the disk and broke it. Thank you very much.
4,best ever Star Trek,This has always been my favorite Star Trek. The adventure and the comedy make a perfect blend.
4,The Enterprise crew in the 1980's=AWSOME ADVENTURE!,"O.K., first my one complaint-The plot where a mysterious, massive, invincible alien force that threatens the Earth was already done before. (Remember the first Star Trek film?) Otherwise, this is a wonderful addition to the Star Trek legacy. Just about everyone already knows the story, where the crew of the now destroyed Enterprise must pilot a captured Klingon Bird Of Prey back in time to the present day (well, 1986 WAS the present day when this came out,) to bring back some humpback whales. It seems to be a toss-up between which is the best Star Trek movie-this one, or part II. The second film, where Kirk and Khan have their last battle, has the most action, but this one has the most comedy, so they both have their strengths. Unless you absolutly hate Star Trek, check this one out."
5,Another successful re-issue,"Paramount has done it again with this excellent transfer, although the sound isn't much better. This set is loaded with stuff, almost as much as the first.The commentary between Shatner and Nimoy is quite enjoyable and makes it worth the price of the DVD alone.Well worth it."
4,Surprisingly few special features for a 2-disc set,"Star Trek IV is a great movie (some say the best of the series) and it looks great on DVD. The problem is that this is a 2-disc set and there are so few extras. No deleted scenes? They filmed an entire scene with Sulu meeting his great-grandfather as a boy, but you won't find it here. And why couldn't this have been the director's edition? I think they did a widescreen director's edition on VHS several years ago, so it's not like they would have had to make a whole new cut. I'm glad to have the extras that were included though. At least there were more than with the Star Trek III 2-disc set. But I'm not sure it justified having two discs."
5,"Heartwarming, funny film. Possibly the best ST film entry of all",I even prefer this one over Star Trek 2:The Wrath of Kahn. Ths story starts off on Vulcan (Spocks' home planet) but you'll forget that setting soon as then--via- a little time traveling-- most of the action takes place in 1986 San Francisco). Shatner and Nimoy (Kirk and Spock) have good often deliberately humourous chemistry and I love all of Kirk's scenes with that Gillian Taylor (Catherine Hicks) who works at an aquarium where the Enterprise needs to acquire a few whales.
5,Hilarious!,Star Trek IV: Voyage Home was the best so far out of the series!I love how they travel to the 20th century and they try to cope with our invirement. Awesome direction by Leonard Nimoy and all of the crew of the Enterprise are neat too. Need to see 1-3 before seeing this one(It doesn't make sense till after watching Search of Spock)
5,Seeing it for the first time.,"I was completely astounded by the quality of this DVD. This is the first time Paramount has used a dual-layered disc for the ""Star Trek"" films. The quality is 2 times better than the other Trek DVDs because they use 2 times the data. It's unfortunate that Paramount didn't have the foresight to use dual layered discs for their other Trek DVDs. Popping this DVD in the player was like watching the movie for the first time. The sound quality and picture quality is absolutely flawless. The quality of the transfer is remarkable. I've been use to watching the film on fuzzy VHS and poor quality broadcasts, so this was an exciting discovery for me. I can't wait for the ST III to come out on DVD, I'm sure the film quality will also be a big improvement. Go buy this DVD, you haven't seen this film until you buy it."
5,Cool Movie,I remember watching this in the theatre when it first came out and now that all the films are available on DVD I have been steadily collecting them..This is one of the best in that it has a fantastic commentary by William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy that offers quite a bit of insight into the making of the film! This film has quite a bit of humor..more so than the earlier and subsequent films..I think this made the film a lot more fun and gave us more of a glimpse into the characters and chemistry among the original cast..I think Nimoy did a fine job of directing the film and from what I understand this film was one of the bigger successes of the 6 films..no wonder..it's a classic! Like many of TOS episodes I feel the producers and directors of the films wanted a lasting testament to the ideals that Gene Roddenberry first crafted in his original stories..they did a fine job! The DVD quality is excellent and the audio is amazing!
2,WAIT FOR THE SPECIAL COLLECTOR'S EDITION!,"Don't buy this edition! Leonard Nimoy confirmed there would be a special edition DVD release in the commentary track on the ""Star Trek III"" DVD. So just wait for that edition! DVD Grade: D-"
5,Not just a Star Trek fan; I am a fan of this line of DVDs.,"Star Trek IV - The Voyage Home (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)Simply, for my money, this is the best movie done exclusively by the Star Trek - TOS group. Adventure, social commentary of the 1980's (it is getting a little dated but holds up well). Some may not like the preachy attitude as well. The movie is just the start, all kinds of special features that will keep you entertained and informed. My personal favorite was the text commentary, as it is in all of the movies that I have in the Star Trek (Two Disc Special Collecters edition)."
2,Second-worst of the six movies,"The movie starts off well but degenerates badly once the characters arrive at earth. The beginning of the movie is also reminiscent (unfortuantely) of the early part of the first movie. In this movie, just substitute an alien whale-lover for V'Ger.There are some humorous moments here and there once the crew returns to 20th-century Earth, but the movie is irreparably marred by a thinly-veiled and silly political agenda on the part the movie's producers. It turns into an embarassing ""Save the whales"" commercial."
1,Stardate-1980's =Lame,"Oh no William Shatner has to save the whales......please!! Come on, this is the worst sci fi movie concept ever. Sending the crew to do social comentary on pretecting the environment. And then there is the fact that the script was terrible and there were some pretty cheasy acting moments. I would even rather watch Starship Troopers or dare I even say Jar Jar Binks commentary on Star Wars Episode 1!!!I'm sure I'll get negative reviews/votes from Trekies who have no life. But they worship their god (william shatner) with so little regard to the real world, that they can't see that this movie is actually worse than Plan 9 From Outer Space. And that shatner isn't a good enough actor to be on a lame show like days of our lives.But the real kicker is that this is one of the best Star Trek moves!!!!!"
4,The Voyage Continues&#65533;,"From a ""trek"" point of view, this film is a must. A definate favorite among the true fans, this is one of the few Star Trek movies that the lay person can also enjoy.The Director's Series ""Featurette"" was quite enjoyable, and leaves a hunger for more. The trailer is a nice addition, but so much more could be there.This DVD is a nice addition to any collection, and is a must have. The quality of the picture and the sound is high, but not as high as the superior latter films (mostly FC and Insurrection).As far as the film goes, the fun style of the well built characters shines. The plot, while a bit singular, is consistent and enjoyable.Bottom line, get this DVD! Star Trek is immortalized - the voyage shall continue in your home and in your hearts."
4,A DVD review,This is my favorite Star Trek film. The characters satirize themselves and it has an interesting story. The picture and sound are excellent. The featurette is an excellent 'making of' feature that runs about 30 minutes. Nimoy gives some interesting information on the making of the film. I think this is a must DVD in any sci-fi fans' collection.
4,"The funniest, and most accessible Trek film","This is the Trek movie that even people who don't like Trek movies enjoy. A heartwarming if preposterous tale that has our intrepid crew going back in time to 1986 to find some whales, who it turns out, are the key to saving the world circa 2282, this fun frolic in San Fran has tons of laughs, great interplay among the cast and lots of campy but good moments."
1,Long time fan of every trek series... Can't stand this movie,"I loved TOS. Saw TNG in my teens ...it formed my values of peace and exploration as an adult, because every character in that series was an outstanding person. Loved DS9 and Voyager both, outstanding. Enterprise: no comment. I don't accept it as part of the ST cannon. The movies, esp II were great.Humpback whales in spaceTransparent Aluminum?No.The only reason I wrote this crappy review was to explain my-clearly contrarian to the Amazonian massses-1 star. Also, I want to say I just don't get you people at all. I think seeing the aggregate rating number of nearly 5 stars, makes me realize why I just don't get along with folks."
3,"Enjoyable the first times, but kinda goes downhill.","I have to agree with Michael Hardy (Jan 9, 2003). I absolutely loved this film the first couple of times I saw it, but over the years, I don't think it has worn than well. Some of the humor has become kind of old. It was an enjoyable romp, pure entertainment, but not much character development. I do wish they would have had more scenes between McCoy and Spock; what a great relationship that was.My favorite Trek movies are 2, 3, 4, and 8 (First Contact). (I couldn't even finish watching Insurrection, that last time I pulled out the tape.)"
2,A whale of a time? hahahahahah.........,"This is a classic example of a TOS movie that should have been a single episode. It stretches ON AND ON until you just have to hit the ""cue"" button, you're so tired of seeing whales singing underwater!!!! I was also quite annoyed by Spock's endeavor to add swear words to his vocabulary . . . guess it was supposed to be funny, but all it got out of me was disgusted sighs. Not only that, the scene toward the end with the whaling ship was FORCED CONFLICT at its best--did anybody think for a minute those whales were going to DIE?? I think the whole episode was thought up to stretch out the crew's ""Voyage Home,"" and the best scene was the last one, where Kirk is officially demoted back to captain. Not only that, ""Miss Marine Biologist"" (her name was GILLIAN, guys!!) was extremely annoying--way too flighty for my taste. However, as usual Nimoy and Shatner managed to transcend the script . . . which is the only thing that keeps this movie from getting a single star."
5,One of the Best Movies Ever,"This movie is a blessing. Star Trek at the top of its game. It's a shame that today we are still having environment issues involving whales species, considering the strong message presented on the storyline."
5,My Fave,I watch this Star Trek movie once a year. It's my favorite. I love that they go back in time to a place where they are so out of place it's funny. I liked that they saved the planet too.
2,Bad acting compounded by bad directing,I liked the story premise -- the Enterprise has to go back in time in order to obtain the necessary information/tools to resolve a crisis in future. But the execution is poor. Spend your time and money on one of the better ST films.
4,Star Trek IV Special Edition - It's ALL Here,"I actually just picked up this DVD today and can't say that I've had a chance to view it yet, but I was compelled to write this now to hopefully dispel what can only be considered a misguided rumor at this point - ""stinky-but-nice"" cites that this edition is 9 minutes shorter than the original; this isn't true, this edition does have a running time of 118 minutes, (I can say that I have seen an advance promo incorrectly stating the 109 minute figure).For those of you who don't already know this, yes, Star Trek IV was the best of the movies with the original crew and this edition is loaded with bonus features - perhaps the most important being the addition of commentary from both Nimoy and Shatner."
5,Best Star Trek Movie Ever,"When I first watched this movie I was totally disappointed because it was nothing at all like ""The Wrath of Khan"". I was expecting intense drama/action and I got comedy. When I watched it again expecting ""dramedy"" I loved it! Action movies get old, I seldom watch Khan any more, but I have watched ""The Voyage Home"" dozens of times over the years.Great interaction between the characters. Great lines. No gratuitous sex of violence. Just great entertainment!"
2,The most inaccurate book ever written on the subject,"This is a review of two halves:The text is hopelessly inaccurate, and can by no means claim to be a definitive work. The story about the Budweiser car is just plain wrong.Still, Never let the truth get in the way of a good story.The photographs are wonderful, although most are inaccurately credited as being copyright the author. This is not the case, and it is unhelpful to the reader, that the correct photo source is unavailable.Buy this book for the illustrations alone."
3,Great Gospel Night in New Orleans,"This is a great CD. The selection of singers chosen for this recording and the selection of songs each one sung is right on time. I had heard Murphy Pace a few years ago during ""Save The Children"" and I have been looking for it since. I feel like I have hit a gold mine. I will treasure my CD."
4,Good book but take time to read,"The book is good with many legal cases to study. But the language the book used is a kind different from ordinary colleage textbooks in terms of words and grammar, so it takes some more time to read and understand."
5,great-simple-effective-inexpensive,"already installed these on my dual-sport 4 years ago and they have been working great. Now i am putting some on my street bike. I really like the fact that they are inside the bars and the wiring runs through the bars, Makes for a clean install and the wire is not hanging out of the throttle and being twisted back and forth with the throttle all the time (I've had trouble with the wire to heat grid connection breaking with the ones in the grips) Plus, you can use any grip you like and can change them any time you want without disturbing the heaters inside the bars."
5,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!,"I cannot believe these jeans were priced so low! The fit is great, the quality of the garment is what you'd expect from 2xist-amazing. I would recommend these jeans highly! If they ever become available again, I will buy more!!!"
2,electronic drum trigger,"This trigger has a convenient shape to fit into a drum setup to use as electronic wood block or cow bell but it is insensitive compared to my other pads. It requires a much stronger hit to produce a sound. It is also more sensitive at the end of the tube than in the middle so there is not a linear sound reproduction along it's length. It can be useful in a drum set-up, but you must be aware of it's sensitivity characteristics when playing it."
4,Tyrese sings it to you soulful..,"I bought this album for Christmas as a gift for myself, and i must say that i'm not left with disappointment. i would give it 4.5 stars if i could. there are maybe 1 or 2 songs that i could just skip over, but the majority of the album is a hit. there are some uptempo beats for grooving in the car and some real mellow songs for just easy listening. i think tyrese has done a good job with this album. i would say if you like r&b than this should be in your album. and besides that sexy body is enough for me.."
4,Tyrese has done it this time!,"This album is his best yet! I would advise everyone to get this. He makes it even better, because his album is filled with slow jams that make you want to spend your time with that special person! The interlude is so nice! I would suggest listening to every song but especially signs of making love, on top of me, and somebody special."
4,Encore une fois Tyrese confirme qu'il est talentueux,Cet album se passe de tout commentaire car ceux qui aiment la musique de Tyrese ne pourront pas tre déus ! Excellent album Tyse !
5,It's easy to see,"That this cd from Tyrese is on point to be exact. From the first song that i heard ""How You Gonna Act Like That"" to ""I Wanna Go There"". There is more than enough to this cd for me to listen to even today which i just did. Also has some mid-up tempo songs on the cd as well. Some of my favorites (although i dont hate any of them) are:I Wanna Go ThereGirl I Can't Help ItSigns of Love MakinI Must Be CrazyU Don't Give A Damn About MeHow You Gonna Act Like ThatKinna Rightthese are listed in no particular order (although ""I Wanna Go There"" is my favorite song on the cd easily). For me this is another great addition to two well done CDs previously. If i had heard only one song on this cd. I would still give it a shot, why? Because i know Tyrese brings the goods when it comes to his singing no question."
3,I WENT THERE....BUT I'M A FAN,"I'M A TYRESE FAN SO I HAD TO PURCHASE THIS CD AS SOON AS IT WAS RELEASED-AND AS PER HIS PREVIOUS RELEASES -MUSIC PRODUCTION IS TOP NOTCH AND SO IS TYRESE'S VOICE, HOWEVER THE SONGS THEMSELVES COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BETTER-THE BALLADS ALL SOUND THE SAME-SEXUAL GHETTO STORIES WHICH ARE TOO REPETATIVE AND ALMOST HAVE THE SAME WORDS-""HOW YOU GONNA ACT LIKE THAT"" HAS SMOOTH BACKGROUND VOCALS AND I ENJOYED IT-DITTO FOR ""SIGNS OF LOVE MAKING""-THE UPTEMPO SONGS ARE TERRIBLE -THE REMAKE OF TUPAC'S ""HOW DO U WANT IT"" WAS THE WORSE AND THERE ONLY A FEW BUT STILL- THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION-""U DON'T GIVE A D**M ABOUT ME"" WHICH IS RHYTMATIC AND CONTAGIOUS. ""SOMEONE SPECIAL AND ""I WANNA GO THERE"" ARE OK....I HAD THIS CD FOR AWHILE AND I ONLY LIKE ABOUT 4-5 SONGS....NOW HIS PREVIOUS RELEASE ""WATTS 2000"" HAS THE LOVE SONGS AND NICE UPTEMPO GROOVES, YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AND IS A FAR BETTER CD."
3,this does album does not show the strength of his voice!,I rushed to buy this album due to the strength of the first single. Tyrese indeed has a good voice. But there is nothing on that album that showcases his voice. He needs some good material.The writing is horrible.... I am surprised that Clive Davis did not send him back in to do this again........ I predict that the album will go gold.... but that is about it.... How bout a challenge next time Tyrese..... Maybe a Diane Warren song or hook up with Babyface.... cause right now your album is weak
2,But I Don't Wanna Go There,"I love me some Tyrese (he is so FINE and has a great voice), but this album is a dud. There are only three good songs off this entire disc and they are, ""How You Gonna Act Like That"" (one of the biggest jams of the year), ""U Don't Give a Damn About Me"" and ""How Do You Want It (Situations)""(a sample of a 2Pac classic). Other than that, this cd is a waste of time. And its no wonder...only ""How You Gonna Act Like That"" was pushed, so that should tell you that Tyrese's own record company had no faith in this cd. Buy it if you must, but this cd is a waste."
4,Tyrese - I Wanna Go There,01.Tyrese - How you gonna act like that02.Tyrese - U dont give a damn about me03.Tyrese - How do u want it04.Tyrese - I must be crazy05.Tyrese - She lets me be a man06.Tyrese - Signs of love makin07.Tyrese - Somebody special08.Tyrese - Girl i cant help it09.Tyrese - Kinna right10.Tyrese - All ghetto girl11.Tyrese - Im the other man12.Tyrese - On top of me13.Tyrese - I wanna go there14.Tyrese - Taking forever
2,Tyrese - I Wanna Go There,"This is the best CD he has put out yet. Everytime I hear the hit song on the CD, ( How You Gona Act Like That ), I just can't get enough of it. Other great songs on the CD include: I Wanna Go There, I'm The Other Man, All Ghetto Girl, and Signs Of Makin Love. But in my point of view, every song is great. If you haven't bought this CD yet you need to, cause it is a must have for every R&B fan."
1,Just Another R Kelly Knock Off,"After hearing this album from my neighbor, what a typical, topical so called R&B singer. Tyrese is another of the many male artists that contradicts himself throughout the album. He writes his music like everyone that is in a relationship has a ghetto twist to his or her business. The album does nothing for me are says much that I can relate too. Just another artist that will be excluded from the ""Neo Soul"" category."
3,melt in your mouth lyrics sung with a velvet beauty,"i must admit that i baught this album purely because of tyreses stunning good looks. however, that doesn't prevent me from having an honest opinion. i feel that this album is beautiful, his melt in your mouth lyrics ooze sincerity and meaning and this album is great for vibeing alone to. however, i found that there is only so much one can take and about half way though i would have to change album. this may just be me being impatient but i really do think that there is only so much chocolate one can eat, and there is only so much tyrese a girl can take.good album, best for the die hard fans."
1,NOT as good as the original version,"Although some reviewers seemed to like this version, I did not find inspiring at all. Some compared it to Steve Reich's work. Maybe. But it resembles more his peculiar 'Tehillim' with voices than his excellent 'Music for 18 Musicians'. This weak attempt at 'In C' does not match Riley's spirit, verve and virtuosity. The original version (by Terry Riley) of 'In C' is really still the best in my humble opinion."
5,Hook on hooking up is the best,"My best cuts are Fishing the Lupe, Doctors Orders,and Tying flys and Telling lies.WARRING you better buy 2 cd's, because after your fishing buddies hear about this one you'll be wondering about the one that got away.All these songs will leave you taping your feet and singing along."
3,"I give 5 stars to the EXPLORING import CD, but not this one","Once again Bar-None gives us a two-fer, which I really do appreciate, especially since Strings Aflame is not available as an import (to my knowledge). Strings sounds quite nice. Exploring pales in comparison to the import. Literally the import sounds like a first generation tape and the Bar-None version like a third generation. Plus Bar-None does not like to let the sound taper off at the end of the music, being worried that the consumer will be put off by the tape hiss from a 1961 recording. So the unnatural, chopped fading and generally poorer sound of the domestic CD is why I gave it three stars."
5,"A classic - excellent, well written, approachable","This book is a perennial favorite of mine - I use it to support my teaching of voice and speech for the actor. Linklater method voice work, based on the work of Iris Warren, has helped to redefine the voice of American performers in the second half of the 20th century. Kristin Linklater's book helps the actor to clarify what is essential to their art, and communicate it vocally. Hu-humm-uh!"
2,I'M A REBEL,"Of the 16 tracks, 14 sound about the same to my untrained ear. If you like someone who screams unintelligible lyrics, except for the frequent F-U that you can make out...this is your album. I found it difficult to dance to without breaking something...like my hip. There are better hardcore/punkish tunes out there. Don't pay more than $2.00."
4,Well,"I don't think these guys are extremely original, they do hardcore. They do it well.Cliche, but done with style."
2,Yuck,"Review by Tyler Wagnon:Denmark's Barcode sounds like a hardcore band with James Hetfield on vocals. It's almost humorous how hard these guys are trying to sound American. They just seem like they are intentionally doing cliché after cliché because they think that's what they should do.Anyway, the music has a NYHC base to it, but they add a few subtle metal elements. All the songs sound the same pretty much. In fact, after a few minutes of listening I checked to see what song I was on and it said 4. I wasn't even aware that track 1 had ended. So that might give you an idea how monotonous this album is. Yuck."
1,most vapid Freench movie ever,"I had the misfortune of seeing this movie in the cinema and was deeply moved. So much so that I begged some complete strangers who were inspecting the movie posters outside not to see it at any cost. I like difficult movies and I don't mind films where nothing much happens for a bit, but this was just a pointless waste of time. Binoche's husband dies and she spends the film looking expressionlessly at various things, driving around a bit and having a sexual encounter which is about as sexy as cleaning linoleum. Just look at the dvd cover for two and a half hours and you've got the movie experience for free."
2,Unacceptable,"This was the 2nd most depressing movie I've seen, of late. I am unable to recommend it to ayone"
3,Suffering Frenchies,"Kieslowki has a way with the camera, beautiful cinematography of ordinary, banal life, objects, and lighting effects. These effects are concentrated in the blue spectrum, one color of the French Flag, which has a meaning - Liberty.I'm all for symbolism or metaphor in art. Most fail at these artistic endeavors, but Blue is a good try. Juliette Binoche has lost her composer husband and daughter in an auto crash. She sells all her earthly belongings, keeping enough to live in a Paris flat and join a swim club. She meets the prostitute downstairs and there's a bit of existential comparisons about lifestyle. Hey, this film is French.The weakness -- the plot barely keeps the film alive. The colors are beautiful, but not enough to keep me interested in these ""suffering"" Frenchies. More Grande Pompon, please!"
3,Fair,Slow paced bordering on boredom. Events are almost predictable (apart from the sexual choices of the heroine..!). I prefer Red over Blue.
4,"grief and chagrin, outstandingly portrayed","This is a brilliant film, about a woman whose life is shattered, first by untimely death and then but the discovery of betrayal. This is te best film of the trilogy by far, with outstanding performances by Binoche and others. This is a real woman, who suffers and learns to renew herself, through art and love. I was deeply moved by this film, totally drawn in."
1,Blue Is French for Boring.,"Viewed: 8/12Rate: 18/12: Let's do some word play. Take the word Blue. What word is a homophone of Blue? It is Blew. Then, it is in the past tense of Blow. What rhymes with Blow? Of course, it is Slow. Blue is Slow. Let me save you the suspense: nothing ever happens in the film. Absolutely nothing. Zero. Zilch. Zippo. ""Mysterious...Sexy!"" *yawn* sure... All in all, I thought Blue was about the color, but I was dead wrong."
2,"It's ok, no big deal","Actually I find the whole series, RED, WHITE, BLUE, to be very disappointing. I love foreign films, and had really looked forward to seeing this trilogy, but, alas, disappontment.Besides Juliette Binoche, there's not much to remember about this film."
3,Binoche is stunning even with minimal story,"This movie is described as a mystery, but it should have been billed as a film about dispair and grief. Juliette Binoche is so stunning that she makes you forget that there isn't much of a plot. The direction is a work of art and is more innovative than anything you'll see in a Hollywood production. Beautiful use of lighting, music, and the color blue. Also, if you enjoyed Juliette Binoche in this movie you might want to rent ""The Horseman On the Roof""."
5,A Well of Tears,"In ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" Virginia Woolf wrote, ""This late age of the world's experience had bred in them all, all men and women, a well of tears. Tears and sorrows; courage and endurance; a perfectly upright and stoical bearing."" In a way, Julie's story is a sort of theft of these lines. In ""this late age of the world's experience,"" with all moral and social certainty removed, Julie must make her way through a world violently liberated from her family. Her aimless, nihilistic, and anonymous lifestyle in a Paris flat after her tragic loss is not so much an attempt to bring meaning back into her life, as it is an attempt to discover how to live in a world without meaning."
5,many shades of Blue,"Much has been written about Kieslowski's 'Blue', indeed on the whole trilogy, but to me this film is amazing on a number of levels. Firstly what should be a bleak and somber movie becomes a liberating and ultimately uplifting experience. Binoche's prescence is amazing almost etheral, she exudes a quiet confidence while always remaining wholly vulnerable. Her performance, like Kieslowski's assured direction, is flawless. Blue (like the entire trilogy) has always been seen as a model of pan-european film, a worthy one it is too."
2,"Boring, excruciatingly slow","You would expect a movie with Binosh to be serious, arty, and pretentious, and you won't be disappointed. The story is extremely slow and rambling, and i get the feeling that the script writer had no idea what would happen next and just kept making things up as he went along."
5,"A Beguiling French Modern Classic. , 14 Sep 2007","Plot:A young widow tries to escape her grief by moving to Paris, but, is escape possible.My Review:The 'Three Colours' trilogy is made by Krzysztof Kieslowski, the director of a small multitude of brilliant and exceptional French films, The Double Life Of Veronique; being one of his best.Remarkable performances are endowed with the protagonist Julie (Juliette Binoche) surviving a car crash that claims the lives of her famous composer husband and five-year-old daughter, Julie (Binoche) makes an anonymous new start in a Paris flat; trying to regain her life.A stern, frozen response to her persona in much the same of this review being short and bereft of essence. She construes vivid memories, haunted by music from her late husband's unfinished piece, a child's laugh could be heard.Verdict:Kieslowski: well done. 9/10."
5,Wright Deadlock,This was exactly what I wanted. I needed to be able to lock my storm door and be able to enter througn a means other than the garage. I received my lock quickly and I am completely satisfied.
5,Wonderful point of view of later Soviet Russia,"This film is absolutely amazing. It gives the point of view from normal people who were living in extraordinary times. As an American I was baffled by what I saw and heard in the film about what these individuals thought of Americans when they were young and there are so many parallels that can be drawn between their thoughts and ours. They wanted peace and global security. I think anyone even mildly interested in Russian culture will enjoy this film. Even if you aren't that interested in the culture, just watch it for the history or the story. It's truly fascinating."
3,Fodor's Pocket Berlin,The only disappointment was the section on the New National Gallery that stated it had impressionist works. It did not-and the employees said it never did.
1,"Boring, boring, boring...","old, I almost fall asleep looking though Orlando Magazine... not much readable content... full of advertorials paid by advertisers...there are much better choices in the city...I like Orlando Style magazine... http://www.orlandostylemag.com/they also have the magazine online plus exciting social pictures and events.Great content with beautiful photography. If you really like to know about Orlando look up this website and subscribe to this magazine."
2,Look closely,"I didn't realize these are of Nerf Material. I will still use as a Christmas gift but was disappointed At a glance, and since it was only a 2-pack, I didn't notice it wasn't of sport-quality material."
1,foam ballls,"I got these for our toddler boy...he immediately took a bite out of the football, the soccer ball was left in the rain and got soggy and never quite recovered. Buy something else."
2,damaged,"It came to me damaged, with a note saying he was sorry he wrote in the book. I had to give as a gift, and lie that the writing in the book was from the author.I didn't have time to return it."
5,Great with predicting!,"This book is great to use for predicting outcomes. I just fold that second page back, read and show the first page, and then have the students guess what the second page might be. My students are 6th grade and they really enjoyed it. Some predictions were very easy, however, some really made you think."
4,Interesting book,"Our 16-month-old son really enjoys this book. I'm surprised because the pictures are not very vibrant, but he does like them. My husband does not like the way the author wrote the book, ""A is for seed, tomorrow's apple"", so he changes the words to ""A is for apple. Seed is tomorrow's apple."" Haha! Overall it is an interesting book that actually holds our active son's attention."
5,A masterpiece!,"Fields of glory is the most beautifully written book I have read in more than a decade--maybe ever. Virtually every page, every paragraph, is wonderfully crafted. How I wish I could read it in French, although I can't imagine that it could be any better. Mr. Rouaud is a genious."
3,High camp adventure,"AIRPORT 77 is a camp classic, full of great moments which leave you open-mouthed with the audacity of it all. Jack Lemmon gains points by taking it seriously, but the highlights include Lee Grant and Christopher Lee giving it a bit of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" and James Stewart playing, well, himself. Pretty good effects for the era, and the dialogue is something else. Great disguise scene at the start, involving changing hair colour and putting on a false moustache."
3,"3rd ""Airport"" Entry Is 3rd Best","Airport '77 features a wide array of Hollywood stars, including Jimmy Stewart, Jack Lemmon, Olivia DeHavilland, Christopher Lee, Joseph Cotten, and Lee Grant. There's probably a few too many stars to keep our eyes on in this story of a privately-owned Boeing 747 luxury jetliner that gets lost in The Bermuda Triangle and crashes into the ocean. But the action and rescue scenes somewhat make up for the weak script. There are some good visual images in the film, especially of the Jumbo Jet smashing into the sea! (Very realistic looking!) Lemmon, as always, gives a good performance, as the plane's #1 pilot. I guess they didn't have room on board for Charo. But she does show up in the 4th (and thus far last) installment of the ""Airport"" series -- ""Airport '79-The Concorde"". That last one gets ""zero"" stars! Good only for a healthy laugh or two!"
3,"""Airport '77"" not a bad disaster flick","Art thieves (one of whom is the co-pilot) hijack a luxury jet after they gas the passengers and crew. Complications arise when they crash it into the Bermuda Triangle, after flying more than 200 miles off course. Everyone regains consciousness as the jet is sinking, and then plots to escape as the fuselage can only hold out for so long. Pilot Jack Lemmon and passengers Christopher Lee and Darren McGavin lead the effort to get out alive. Not a bad effort in the disaster genre, with good performances and special effects. Lots of extra footage added for television, so fans might want to check it out then."
3,"""SET A COURSE FOR ADVENTURE,.. YOUR MIND ON A NEW ROMANCE!""","I know, I know it's not that bad!......'Airport 77' is actually better than I rememebered, but it's hard not to think of these films as predecessors to the 'Love Boat'! Like most of these movies the first three quarters of an hour or so is just meeting the cast and setting up the inevitable disaster that will unfold, but once this one gets going, it does keep up the tension....just don't think about the credibility of it too long! It's available on a box set with the other 3 Airport films at a bargain price so it your a fan of the series......."
2,"Not as bad as the second, but better than the fourth!","Two things make this film worthwhile: 1) the effect of the plane slicing a ocean-standing tower and careening toward the sea, and (2) Lee Grant's line to a young lady getting too cozy with Grant's husband, played by Christopher Lee.Other than that, the film is as ""waterlogged"" as the downed airliner."
2,Judwaa,"I was very disappointed. The video indicated it included english subtitles and the main menu listed there were english subtitles, but nothing I tried worked. Since there were no subtitles, I gave up trying to follow the story. I did receive the video promptly."
3,Get the lamp modules and throw out the controller.,I use these HA03 LAMP MODULEs with GE Wireless Lighting Control 45601 and they work fine. It's a good deal for two of the modules plus the controller. But the HA07 controller is so ridiculous to program that you're better off discarding it right away. I was able to configure it but I'm not going to do it again.
1,Item quickly failed...,"Nothing against the Seller because this item came quickly and was packed well...While setting up the controller, one of the lamp modules failed. Looking at other reviews, this seems to be the norm, and they have a high failure rate.The controller module wasn't compatible with Micasa2 Z-Wave controller...or at least I couldn't get the two to work together.So---for the kit, I got one lamp module that worked.I don't recommend these---good luck!~"
4,A couch potato's dream!,"There is nothing really spectacular sounding about this system, but it really is quite an interesting personalized setup, once you invest into it. This is a ""starter kit"" so basically, you must be warned that you will be spending quite a bit more to enhance your whole house. It's the master remote and two wall devices that control two lamps. That's it. You will never run out of room on your master remote, and you can add many different modules to fit your needs. Some require an electrician skill, and others you simply plug in or attach. Indoor lamps, ceiling lights, and other dimming features, and outdoor lighting and bulbs that work simply buy screwing them into the socket. The ideas are endless. Honestly, the first thing I thought about were Christmas lights. Imagine the ease of controlling that mess with one remote. All in all, works well, but it's the collection aspect that will get costly. But if it saves you from pausing your Tivo, it's all good."
3,"just an ""ok"" replacement for x-10 system","isn't exactly 100% reliable so don't get your hopes up. i found it to be on par with the x-10 system as far as reliability. i was planning on upgrading my x-10 system to zwave, but haven't been completely impressed yet."
1,Can't add other HomeSettings modules to the controller.,"Despite language on the product box that says the HA07 controller will work with ""any"" Z-Wave enabled module, it simply won't.I've got numerous other Z-Wave modules. (All are made by the same manufacturer that makes this controller: Intermatic HomeSettings).None of them can be added to the controller making the HA07 unit completly unusable. Returning the entire kit and will turn to another home automation platform besides Z-Wave. I think this platform is way too unreliable.By the way, don't try going to the ""support"" page on the HomeSettings website. It's completely empty of content.... seriously! It's a big white page. So much for trying to troubleshoot this issue on my own."
4,Works well as a secondary controller,I have used this both as a primary and a secondary controller. It may not be as useful as a primary controller because the firmware is outdated and one will not be able to use the date and time and DST functions reliably. It works well though as a secondary controller for just turning z-wave modules off or on manually.
4,It works. I'm satisfied.,It worked as promised. I haven't put it into use as yet but I expect no problems. I need more words in my review.There I can submit now.
3,unreliable opreation,"The controller is unreliable in turning my lights on and also off. I have had the system for several months and use it to control lighting daily for outside lights as well as lighting while I am away. They work fine for days and then for some unknown reason either a light will not come on as programed or will not go off as programed. Also, it is not the most user friendly when it comes to programming or changing the program. I believe they still have work to do before this is a five star system."
4,Mine works great.,"I just got one of these and I too was a bit baffled at how to program... until I read the instructions. It's a little tricky (why I give it four stars) but far from a ""hair pulling"" experience. It works very well and has some nice features. I can't wait to get some more modules around the house.For those that can't seem to understand the instructions, Intermatic also has a website with flash animations to walk you through the set up."
4,Neat!,"I really like this, and found it quite easy to set up. I have lights in my bedroom and kids' room set up, so I can turn them on from the living-room (or anywhere else in the house).I understand that there are other add-on modules for this system, which I may decide to experiment with."
2,Doesn't work with CFL's,With everyone converting to CFL lighting you would expect a company to tell you in the product decription that CFL lights will not work unless you have the appliance modules....disappointing.Returned product for refund
1,"This is Sign English, not ASL","The title of this video, ""Basic Sign Language"", is misleading, because it is really teaching a hybrid of American Sign Language (a genuine language, just as English is) and Signed English, which is a cumbersome manual code for English, not a language. Anyone with an interest in and respect for Deaf culture and ASL would be better off taking a few classes taught by a deaf person at their local community college.If you prefer a video, please avoid ones like this which present ASL/Sign English pidgin as the langauge of the deaf (Clues to look for are the arraging of ASL phrases in English word order and the use of strictly English grammar words such as ""is"".) The true grace and texture of ASL cannot be found here."
1,Waste of time,"This tape was a waste of time. You could learn it all from a book. She teaches the manual alphabet (which I already knew), the number signs 1-10, and a few other beginning signs. She wastes too much time yacking and not enough time signing. She underestimates the intelligence of her adult audience. I also thought she would group words together by subject, such as foods, colors, people, household things, etc. She could have put a lot more useful information in this video if she had talked less and just showed the signs. The doctor's office visit was a waste of time."
3,"Not bad, not great.","A reasonably interesting, well-written Star Trek book, this story's pacing was just a touch off. It seemed to me that it peaked a bit too soon, with the last 40 pages or so something of an anticlimax, if not uninteresting. It had an interesting basic concept, the conflict between the ""religious beliefs"" of alien species, and the misunderstandings that can occur when they come into conflict, and this concept was handled pretty well. My head tells me that I should give this story a fourth star; reading over what I've said, this sounds like a four-star review and I can't honestly say why it doesn't rate that highly, but I just didn't enjoy it enough to rate it that highly."
3,Quick easy read.,David Niall Wilson took the time to develop the atmosphere and setting. He did not take any time to develop character. The reader must use character refference from the TV series to understand how characters react to the setting. A good escapist novel that I will read again
2,Just couldn't finish it.,"It's extrememly rare that I don't finish a book, especially a Voyager novel. But I just couldn't do it.While this book had beautiful imagery and solid story developments, it had no heart. There was little to no characterization. The whole thing seemed hollow to me."
4,Cuban music with African vocal overtones,"Orchestra Baobob is an old band - they've been around well over 20 years, and the Latin tinge is both unusual and powerful, here, setting their music apart from competitors and creating a niche all their own."
4,Slightly Overrated,"Unless this is your only O.B. album, there's some filler here. Hommage A Tonton Ferrer is essentially a shorter version (with different lyrics) of Utrus Horas, the first track on Pirates Choice, and the longer version is better played and more hypnotic. El Son Te Llama is a faster, shorter cover of the better-played version from On Verra Ca. (The original version, by the way, is also available on Putumayo Presents Afro-Latino, an excellent compilation.) The remaining seven songs are quite good and offer plenty of variety. One only wishes O.B. could have re-entered the studio, after so many years, with totally original material."
4,just what I needed,This book was exactly what I needed for my class.Shipping was quick and I'm satisfied.
4,Added bonus,Watched it and I have to say I was not expecting a lecture.........bonus! Ver informative and not repetitive as the food word generally gets. Great insights. The video is a little old that is why a four star.
4,Really great documentary,Very good information in this DVD. Read the book and you'll see the big picture.
1,Combo? Not really,"In the picture it looks like you can have both the volleyball and basketball at the same time. But the fact is, you must take it apart to switch between games. Not very user friendly.The decal on the backboard pelled off after the first day in the great outdoors.A poorly made product. I would not recommend that you purchase this."
5,Blueberry Bed,I'm getting lots of compliments on this bed and how the color and style are perfect. Great product!
4,Electric apricot,"If you are tour head, this movie is a scream. It pokes hilarious fun at the jam band/festival scene, and features some amazing musicians who are not afraid to laugh at themselves. It also has great soundtrack. A great addition to a fun loving movie collection."
2,not too impressed,I am a huge claypool fan and i really hate to bash his work but i was very disappointed when i watched this movie. I literally had to force myself to continue watching it. It's so slow and i dont think i even laughed once. definitely did not live up to all the reviews.
1,"This movie never does anything, worse than a lazy Hippie.",I got this movie for a friend. He has always liked the Grateful Dead and Phish. He and I both hated this movie. He toured with the Dead and I didn't. The only common ground for us is that this movie blows!
3,Decent...not what I was expected,"Good not great, not exactly sure who this would appeal to, possibly huge Les Claypool fans"
5,Greatest book ever.,"I stopped reading my Con law casebook about 2 weeks into class and started reading this instead. This book saved me from certain failure in this class. The single best thing about this book is that he puts everything in context. I think failing to connect the dots and understand how concepts are related to each other is what makes this course so difficult. Erwin is the man!I used the older edition, which worked out just fine and was much cheaper."
5,Got me through Con Law!,"This book was extremely helpful! All law students should get it, whether it's recommended or not :)"
3,The honest response,"The most well-organized, concise and easy for understanding con law book. Many JD students around US strongly recommened it."
3,Review on Purchased Book,I bought this book and it was good for me. The text is okay and i recommend people to purchase on Amazon.
2,Poor quality paper,"I'm about a quarter-way into book and I can say that I've enjoyed the way the material is presented. My only gripe is the super thin paper it's printed on! It's so tranparent that you can read two pages at once, if you know what I mean. I wish I could get an electronic version of this instead."
3,Book,"Very in-depth, too in-depth.. I returned it because i was looking for a more concise treatise.."
5,Saving my life,"I am using Chemerinsky's text in Con Law as a first year and it's so difficult to understand! This book has saved my life, it is easy to understand and goes into depth in the areas that I most need it. Everyone finding Con Law to be difficult to use this book."
5,Just as good as the previous edition,"This adds a lot of material that has been covered by the Supreme Court in the interim period between the current publication and that of the second edition (2002). All of the praise from the prior edition can be properly bestowed upon this one as well; it essentially consists of the same material with the new cases inserted. Also, prior language that mused about the direction that a particular issue would take in the coming years have been resolved in some instances, so those parts have been replaced with Chemerinsky's excellent chronological and ideological thread of cases, up to the end of the last Court session. This book, more clearly than most, gives the average (and below-average) law student an easy-to-follow guide through the maze that is the first year Constitutional law course. A great help, and a necessary purchase."
3,Decent Study Aid,"This is a decent study aid when used along with the Chemerinsky textbook, especially if your Con Law teacher is spacey like mine. It is most useful for clarification during class and outlining, but is too cumbersome to provide a quick overview of the material.My criticism is that there are several typos (EX: Plant v. Spendthrift Farms should be Plaut v. Spendthrift Farms. This mistake was repeated throughout the book), and it is not structured the same as the textbook to which it is keyed. The notes following the cases in the textbook are reprinted verbatim in the supplement, so if anything is unclear you must look somewhere else. Cases appear in different sections and some major cases are left out entirely. This doesn't lessen it's usefulness entirely, but it makes it difficult to find information quickly.Overall, it has been a lifesaver in my Con Law course, but I think Emanuel could be just as effective."
5,Absolutely Necessary!,"This companion to Chemerinsky's case book is absolutely necessary for your study of constitutional law. However, it is only useful if your class requires the casebook by Chemerinsky."
3,Eh... maybe better for some teachers than others,"Our class uses the Brest casebook, and not the Chemerinsky casebook. Maybe that's why I don't think this supplement helps out very much with my class. Casebriefs website does the same thing as this supplement in my opinion. Otherwise its easy reading in layman's terms, which of course I definitely appreciate."
4,Great to follow along with during class,"I'm in a ConLaw class right now that tends to wander and this book has definitely helped me to understand the fundamental points of the cases we are reading and the concepts we are learning. It is curious why Mr. Chemerinsky couldn't have been this concise in the casebook, but that's beside the point. :)That being said, this is NOT a study aid for finals. It is way too indepth and specific to be used in the wee hours before a ConLaw final. Better to use this as a companion to your casebook and to follow along throughout the term."
5,AWESOME SUPPLEMENT!!!!,"This book is a great supplement, even if you don't have Chemerinsky's casebook. Concise case summaries and great background information, I highly recommend this hornbook."
5,A Lesson With Pancho,"This is a later edition that re-prints in vivid stop-photo essential strokes of the greatest tennis player of his time, Richard ""Pancho"" Gonzales. His game, the California serve-and-volley style, is exactly the game of our current master, Roger Federer. The instruction notes within are as sparingly clear as the fluid strokes of this legend. 30 years after learning the game, I returned to his service technique to remove my own personal lazy, idiosyncratic additions over time. Why pay hundreds of dollars in lessons if you can practice these strokes against a mirror and take them to the court for repetition. Our losing Davis Cup teams would be wise to contain only players who have mastered these essentials. This book is the tennis equivalent of the Da Vinci Codex."
4,Birthday gift,I purchased the Tamagotchi V4 for a friend of my daughter - she loved it and it came in perfect condition. Thanks for offering a great product!
2,Not quite up to par,"I've had two of these sets delivered; the second will be going back as well. The first had color distortions like you'd get from poor shielding - nothing seemed to correct this. The second has a similar distortion problem but not as bad, but has a crooked picture - horizontal lines on the screen (including the set's internal menus) tilt such that the left side is about a half-inch higher than the right side. There is no documented way to adjust the screen for this. The picture is otherwise terrific, though color is a little saturated on the factory settings. The picture in picture feature is great, the set has a wealth of AV inputs and even an audio output if you want to pipe audio back through your AV system. The remote is fairly nice, though there are an awful lot of controls for a TV. If the picture wasn't crooked I'd be loving this set, but with one already sent back, I'm likely to change brands rather than try a third JVC."
5,RUNNING OUT OF SOUVENIRS,"***** 1969. Adapted from Harry Lawton'sTell Them Willie Boy is Here, this film was written and directed by Abraham Polonsky. A brand new zone 2 DVD of it is now available at Amazon.fr in a pristine copy. Texas, 1909. American Indian Willie Boy is hunted by sheriff Robert Redford in the desert. Both will lose there their last illusions. One can either enjoy this western as a powerful drama or appreciate the way Abraham Polonsky comments one of the rare American myths. A masterpiece that needs to be seen at least twice to be fully understood."
5,always love watching him,it was a good one he is funny and the movie was a good comedy action always love watching Robert Blake
3,A Quiet Tale Of Hunter Vs. The Hunted,"An Unusual role for Robert Redford but one he plays very well with a rugged style as a tough sherrif who wants to live up to his father`s great reputation leads a massive manhunt for Wille, an Indian who killed in self defense who now with his girlfriend must stay one step ahead of Redford & Company relentless pursuit An Entertaing western with a strong message does stagger during the halfway mark of the film but the ending delivers with a classic shootout. Redford manages to pull off a convincing macho performance."
4,Mr. Williams has done it again.,"I found this book to be not only a great coffee table book but also a very good cook book. Whatever Chuck Williams & friends attach their name to is done in such excellent taste - the photographs are beautiful and even though the recipes look complicated, they are easy to follow. Diane gives little hints or suggestions before each recipe which help. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because nothing is perfect."
5,JESSICA McCLINTOCK IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCES!,"This is one of my favorite perfume's! It is a romantic, and light, floral, scent! It feels like a clean and cool & refreshing, bright day of spring! I highly recommend this fragrance!This perfume lasts all day, and you do not have to use much! I very lightly apply Jessica McClintock perfume behind my ears, and at my wrists, and at the base of my throat, and below my ankle bone on each foot, and behind my knees. And I also, apply it lightly behind my neck.I have learned that fragrance last longer, when you do it in layers: 1st-use Jessica McClintock body gel or body wash, in your bath or shower/2nd-on dry clean skin use, Jessica McClintock body lotion,or cream/3rd-and use Jessica McClintock talc powder if available/4th- then apply lightly, Jessica McClintock perfume spray. I just love this beautiful, smelling fragrance!"
5,Jessica Mc Clintock,Great service and delivered as promised. Still an excellent perfume after all these years!
1,NOT THE REAL THING!,"This perfume does not even smell close to the ""real"" Jessica Mcclintock perfume. YES! I am requesting a full refund. I will not buy from this person again."
2,Very heavy.,"Unfortunately, this was not the scent that I thought it was when I ordered it. It is overpowering, heavy, and I found it sickening sweet. I tried it for a couple of days, hoping it would fade into something lighter and more tolerable or maybe I would just get used to it. The perfume stays on strong for hour. My co-workers noticed the perfume immediately, which is not a good sign."
5,Lily of the Valley,Nice floral fragrance of Lily of The Valley. I bought this for my wife and really notice when she wears it. product arrived quickly and in brand new condition.
5,An Unforgettable fragrance!,I have worn this parfume ever since she came out with it. It is still my favorite!
5,My favorite perfume at a tremendous price!!,"I absolutely love Jessica Mcclintock perfume, but dread paying the department store price. What a find this was. Delivery was prompt and I'm thrilled with the perfume."
1,Not Recommended,"Think this is not a genuine Jessica Mcclintock. I gave to my wife as my gift, but she told me that this not a genuine Jessica Mcclintock. Be ware of it."
1,Not like an original,Quite disappointed as the scent is not the same as the many that I've purchase from Macy's or Nordstrom stores! It has a cheap cologne scents that you get at the pharmacy! It is very unfortunate that Amazon does not allow returns or exchange for perfumes!
2,could see a distinct difference,Do not waste your money on this perfume. I immediately could see a distinct difference in this perfume and the identical perfume i already had at home. Immediately you could tell the color of the liquid in the bottle was different.
5,A long time favorite perfume,This perfume is light. I have been wearing it for years and the price through here was very reasonable. The fragrance is like lily of the valley.
2,Too strong,This is not the same original light scent. It's a lot stronger and sweeter like what a couple others have said. So strong that it gives me a headache and makes me sneeze. I am disappointed in this product.
5,Never responded to my E-mail,"I tried to cancel this item immediately after I purchased it. I noticed that it was a small bottle, I needed a large bottle, This person never, to this day responded to my email. Not a very honorable thing to do."
3,Too Sweet,"I used to wear this perfume all the time about 10 years ago and was complimented on it regularly. I was looking for a new fragrance and thought I'd give it another try. I don't remember it being so strong, too sweet smelling to me. Maybe they've changed their formula."
4,Very good book - though needs updating,It was this book that taught me SQL - from knowing next to nothing!!!Its getting a little out of date now but even so a good buy. It is for beginners (to SQL though not programming) but it can get a little mind bending in places.
3,"Good for beginner, useless for advanced","I had a little SQL background before getting this book (background = seeing other SQL code and trying to figure out what it was doing).I bought this book hoping to really learn SQL, but didn't gather too much more from it. Now I have learned SQL more indepth, but still need a good reference book to look up typical ""tricks"" or common functions. This book is now useless.On the cover it says ""exploit your database's full capacity""...which is entirely misleading because most of the exploits are not covered at all in this book.Great for beginner to get to intermediate stage of typical SELECT, INSERT, etc...but if you want to do more than typical, this book is NOT for you."
1,This is not a well-written book.,"Myself and another person who bought this book as required by an online SQL class both agree that this is not a well-written book. On many occasions during the first few chapters (that's all I could take) I found myself thinking ""where did that come from?"". The book does not follow a logical progression nor does it explain itself well. Additionally, the quality and quantity of examples are lacking.In fact, my lack of tolerance with this book caused me to drop the class. I have used other WROX publications (""Visual Basic 5"", ""Active Server Pages""), and have found them to be finely written books. WROX should really consider talking to the person who proofed this book and gave it the ""Yes, that's what WROX wants to be its SQL book"" stamp."
2,"Good information, but difficult to follow","While the book offers many good bits of information about SQL, the application of those bits is often clouded. The author rambles and includes trivial points that only serve to distract the reader. When he does makes a focused statement it is often a good one.The author's experience with the standards group has a negative impact on the overall text. The author will explain SQL commands and techniques only to end with something like ""but no vender currently implements this."" It is very frustrating to struggle to grasp a concept only to realize that you have wasted your time. Too often, that was my experience with this book."
2,Definitely NOT FOR BEGINNERS,"I bought this book after reading several favorable recommendations. Unfortunately, they were all from people who had some prior knowledge of SQL and ""assumed"" that this book would be good for beginners, because it made complete sense to them when they read it.Having no SQL knowledge whatsoever, I had a hard time trying to fish out little SQL code tidbits that I could run myself, and thereby learn by doing. This book really discourages that. (See the reader review from 1998-04-10.)If you are new to SQL, try Teach Yourself SQL in 24 hours (don't let the title throw you) from Sam's Publishing, which I found to be much better suited for neophytes.Also, the author is member of Ansi SQL standards committee, and it shows. He talks about esoteric SQL topics, i.e. comparing facets of SQL-92 to sQL-89, etc. Not only does this get in the way of the useful content, it is usually an irrelevant distraction that the reader could do without."
3,Very good SQL intro for programmers,"The publisher of this book calls its line of books ""Programmer to Programmer."" This book is a good introduction to SQL, written for programmers. There is a strong emphasis on theory: of databases, of SQL, and of how to use SQL. Theory is presented before syntax, which was very helpful for me. The book's emphasis on theory, and the fact that it was written for programmers, are what make this book unique.At times the flow of topics is a little confusing, and the book often reads like it was proofread by someone not well-versed in American English. However, the overall presentation of SQL and database concepts far outweighs the book's sometimes mediocre readability.I would not recommend this book to the non-programmer, but I highly recommend it to the intelligent programmer who wants to understand SQL and be a high-quality database programmer."
2,Beginners Beware,"Database design and SQL are difficult subjects but a book for beginners should make every effort to accomodate the beginner by simplifying it as much as possible. And, to a degree, this book does that. But there are too many forays into outer space. Consider this passage from page 122: 'You can summarize the rule as follows: if X and Y are columns and X is a key, then for any Z which is a proper subset of X, it can't be the case that Z determines Y.' No matter how elegant, I don't think anyone would argue that this is helpful for a beginner. On the contrary, it tends to make the subject seem as difficult as possible. Hardly a proper goal for a beginner's book. I am about half-way through this book and, increasingly, I am going to MSDN for a clearer explanation to each of the subjects that Celko addresses."
3,Not For Joe Celko Fans,"I ordered this book, despite the word ""INSTANT"" in its title (how ""Instant"" can SQL get?) only because it was Celko's latest book. This book is below Celko's usual caliber (I consider Joe Celko as one of the leading authorities on SQL and especially writing about SQL). It is intended for the begining/not-so-begining SQL programmer. The intermediate programmer would be happier and more satisfied with Celko's: SQL for Smarties. It is here where you can find the Joe Celko we used to know and admire who wrote for DBMS magazine! I only wish that Celko had written SQL books for begginers back when my generation of programmers were begining to learn the language."
4,heavy going,"Actually, I cannot bear to read it. I would like all scholarly books to be witty in the best sense of the word, or ""Chestertonesque"" if you prefer.The Refashioning of Catholicism, 1450-1700: A Reassessment of the Counter ReformationI was attracted by the fine English Catholic name independently from the obvious high quality of the scholarship."
4,A Solid Job Hunting Resource,"""Jobs and the Military Spouse"" is a must-have primer on job hunting for military spouses. It is a great reference on traditional methods and the essential fundamentals for clarifying your goals and initiating a job search. I highly recommend it to military spouses new to the employment arena, or those needing to brush up on their basic career planning skills."
1,Junk personified!!!,"What you have here is basically an incredibly overpriced and unwieldy stopwatch.Having coached track and field and cross-country for 20 years I've had plentyof experiences (mostly bad) with this product.You name it and it has gone wrong (with 3 different S149's.)Paper jams, time locks, total timer failure are the norm with this Edsel of watches.You're better of spending $60.00 to $70.00 on a dependable handheld watch with 100lap memory and multiple split functions.If you're dead set on buying one of these, get one on Ebay and save yourself $100-$200. Then again you'd be better off with a sundial than with an S149.The Pet Rock of Watches"
3,No owner's manual,"This stopwatch printer is great and meets my needs as a race director of a few 5k races. The only problem was that it didn't come with an owner's manual, so I had do download one from the website. Can't imagine that anyone could intuitively know how to work all the features. Perhaps this was an oversight, but I'd check before you buy."
1,Very disappointed with the SELLER!!,"I bought the film because I want it for my DVD collection. I'd already seen the film before, and of course I have nothing to complaint about the movie. I spect receiving a normal DVD, including the sam cover as it is shown on the product description at Amazon, but when I received it I found out that the movie is only a simple dvd, with no cover at all, placed in a clear dvd box, with no cover, no specification, no pictures, no nothing but a simple dvd!!!I'm really disappointed, since I paid an amount that isn't cheap for a dvd, and I received the cheapest case ever.Very bad acquisition for a dvd collection, and very bad impression about the seller."
5,A very great masterpiece,"Before Orson Welles, Fritz Lang and Buñuel...there was Abel Gance! Before Dr. King, Mandela, Gandy, Solyentizin, Romero or Manchú...there was Gance. If you really love good movies this is a must in your very private collection; the ""kind of"" you will see again and again, the ""kind of"" make you think a lot. Abel Gance took the post from Erich Remarque and Henry Dunnant and very well ahead of his time spoke his mind asserting that in wars eventually, even weapons makers and weapons traders, bloodthirsty beligerant people LOST! Gance was not only clever but brave to make this beauty...the interesting thing is that even when the firs version was lost, Gance start working and made it again. Is a legacy for those who don't belive war has ever solve the problems of the world. A real masterpice from a time when special effects were in diappers. Bertollucci, Lean, Costa Gavras and Orson Wells himself acclaimed this movie. Get it you will not regret."
4,This is a really good film!,"When this movie first opened years ago, I was so blown away that I went to see it again the following night. Although it is somewhat dated, LOGAN'S RUN still has that impressive quality for today's audience. (Add another point if you think Michael York is hot!) Most definitely worth purchasing."
2,Logan's Yawn,"I first saw this about 25 years ago and had some pretty good memories of it. The carousel idea was especially interesting, since I believed then, as now, that all things are renewed upon so-called death. That is the part that truly brought me back for another viewing.During this particular look-see, I was troubled by the way the plot bounced and ebbed and jerked around and ran itself into logistical walls. There were also too many trite and/or cornball elements. One of the little dome models was apparently made of bubble wrap.I didn't even finish it."
4,Dated but a classic...,"I remember this movie when it first came out in 1976 and it was as memorable now as it was then. Yes Star Wars came out at about the same time, but Star Wars for the most part was set in outer space. This was set down here on merry old earth. Star Wars also had a budget many times larger than Logans Run. By todays standards the special effects seem almost campy but in 1976 they where cutting edge. If you get the chance read the book which is even better. About the only thing I could fault it for was the lack of background regarding all that's happened and is happening."
4,Tacky fun,"Ok. This is not really a fair review. I have been weaned on this movie since I was very young. I would always catch the end or bits and bobs on TV for years and years. Not util I got the DVD did I see the film for the first time. Shockingly dated, bad special effects and it is very slow in a lot of points. But it does tell a story. One could, if they wished, say that this is a parable for the ""ME"" generation. How life is over once your 30. How live is about the searching for pleasure. How one person beings to see that life does not end at 30....bla bla bla. But it's just a movie and a fun one. If you could imagine a future designed by the same person who designed all those 70's discos, this is what it would look like."
5,This is A Science Fiction Gem!!! (And Ms. Agutter is HOT!!!),I first saw this movie back when I was 16 and I remember being almost mesmerized by it. It concerns a future Earth where nobody is allowed to reach the age of 30. That kind of sounds a lot like the Hollywood Movie Industry!!! We see Michael York on the run with Jenny Agutter until they discover the wisdom of Old Age thanks to a wonderful performance by Peter Ustinov. It was only a couple of years ago that I read that the city portrayed in the movie was in reality a very cleverly disguised shopping mall. Sadly we do not see enough of Ms. Agutter in movies these days.
4,Widescreen DVD version precedes this pan-and-scan release.,"To those who appreciate seeing a film which was filmed in widescreen, actually presented in widescreen, forget this release of Logan's Run, the cover of which depicts a hand palming a red crystal. The 2004 release, with the ""rainbow"" cover, contains both the original widescreen and butchered pan-and-scan versions, all on one disc."
5,classic movie great SF,"Michael York!In the year 2274, after the world has been decimated by a holocaust, a new society is built and resides in a domed city. However, it is forbidden for humans to live beyond 30 and you are given two choices, either to go through a ritual called Carousel with the promise of being ""renewed"", or go on the run and risk being hunted down by an elite police force known as Sandmen."
3,About What You'd Expect From Aging Sci-Fi,"I have to admit that I liked the epcot-esque city in which this story is based. Its retro sci-fi look is great and lends itself well to the story. The special effects range from ""good for the time"" to just plain ""bad"". The story itself drags on a little too long. There is no reason this movie should be 120 minutes. The premise, however, is good and has not been well duplicated since the original. I simply wish sci-fi movies could have avoided ""coming of age"" during the time of psychedelic filmography. Hard core classic sci-fi fans might be intrigued, but I fear most everyone else will be bored with this film. I can say it's average, and that's about all."
4,Back to the Future,"This movie is OK for Sci-Fi. However, because there is no originality in Hollywood, the movie ""The Island"" with Ewan McGregor is a remake of this movie. ""The Island"" is so very similar, just an update of ""Logan's Run"". If you like originals, get this movie."
3,Not really what I expected,"I suppose it just wasnt my cup of tea. I felt the story line could have been better developed. However, this one was probably cutting edge for it's time."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS I REMEMBERED,I saw this movie when It was new and thought it was great. It is still ok for an old sifi
4,Classics never get old,I know with technology the way it is today this futuristic twist is behind the times but I loved it as a little girl and I'm a collector of classic movies so this is a keeper.
3,A sci-fi story about deception on a life and death level.,"An inexpensive little sci-fi film that's fun to watch. The plot involves young people living in a society where those over the age of 30 are recycled to be born again. Of course this is nonsense, and Michael York catches on. The viewer becomes caught up not in the sets or acting but in the idea of this society and the unravelling of the truth about it. Particularly entertaining is Peter Ustinov who is discovered ""outside"" and is, to the amazement of the hero and his beautiful companion, Jenny Agutter, oddly, an old man. Don't expect ""Star Wars,"" just enjoy the story. Sidelight: A short-lived TV series was spun off from the film in the late '70's."
3,"Love the film, not neccecarily the DVD","The description on Amazon didn't tell me this was a ""full screen"" pan and scan DVD. I was hoping for the film exactly the way it was shown in the theater, not something that some camera man re-directed so that it would fit on somebody's old-style TV. Caveat Emptor definitely applies here. Now that I have the film, I'll start looking for the wide-screen version."
3,"unlike fine wine,logan's run doesn't age very well","when i was growing up i must have seen this movie 5 times and really loved it. even though i had read the books and knew that the movie was different,but i loved it anyway.flash foward to now and i watched this again just a while back and oh man did it age bad! the story was always paper thin but at 9 and 10 years old you don't see that,well i see it now. the f/x are bad(but to be fair they were pretty good in the 70's),and the acting is just not there. oh well like they say, you can't go home again. still you may find something to enjoy about it,i mean i still own it and won't sell it so even if it's not great you may like it."
1,Who are these people that gave it 5 stars!?!?,"We watched this movie based on the positive reviews and couldn't believe we wasted our time watching the first hour. After that, we fast forwarded to see if it got any better. It didn't. It should have been rated an R for the female upper body nudity and even without that problem, the movie was a typical 70's psychodelic-music, holographic-artistic, drug-induced? film (in my opinion). I don't EVER want to see it (or recommend it to anyone) again!"
3,Should be rated R,"As a mom, I have to throw my 2 cents in about the rating of this movie. I remember watching it as a kid on tv and recently bought it to share with my family. (Fortunately I previewed it before showing it to my kids.) I was shocked when Logan and Jessica ran into the ""love shop"" where there was a kind of naked orgy going on in semi darkness. You can see women's naked breasts in the scene. Later, to get warm Jessica takes off her dress, exposing her breasts. There is another scene where people have been frozen and for some reason they all took off their clothes before being frozen. So, more naked people. I loved the movie for the neat effects that are kind of cheesy now, but I am sad that I have to throw the movie in the trash because of the nudity."
2,Would actually improve with a remake.,"Plot is pretty good, dialogue stilted but could be salvaged, but dear god, please get rid of those cheesy Star-Trek sets and costumes, and that horrible soundtrack. If someone really talented did this it could be extremely chilling. As it is it's about half a step up from William Shatner."
4,An awesome view of an overpopulated future,"I read the book as a young person and loved it. I saw the movie many years later. Even though it's definitely got that wicked 70's vibe, it's still a good movie and captures the essence of the original story. It's a dark look at humanity's attempt to deal with an overpopulated and over-used world in a creative twist.Enjoy it."
3,Not bad...,This is an older movie but I expected it to be digitally mastered in this day and age. Quality not that good.
4,Mall Rats: The Movie,"This film predicts that in 2274 the citizens of an un-named English speaking nation, will be obsessed with plastic surgery, sex, working out and staying young. It was off by only 272 years."
3,The LOGAN'S RUN DVD,"LOGAN'S RUN is a mediocre movie, but, surprisingly, a pretty good DVD with a sizable amount of extras. The picture isnt bad, but it isnt great; same goes for the sound. The first extra feature is the theatrical trailer. I always love to see vintage trailers, so this extra is nice. The next extra feature is a short documentary, entitled A LOOK INTO THE 23RD CENTURY. This documentary gives a fair amount of insight into the making of the film, and is worth watching. The best extra on this DVD is the feature length commentary by director, Michael Anderson; actor, Michael York and costume designer, Bill Thomas. These three men collaborate for a wonderfully revealing and compelling commentary. The price of the DVD is worth it, just for this commentary alone."
3,I love the Plot,"I love the plot of this movie, It is a long movie, so it is hard to watch over and over, but if you like Sci-Fi, then you will like Logans Run. If you can get past the 70's look of the film, the plot is excellent.There has been a nucular war, and many generations of people have lived in this self contained paridise. no one has been out side for hundreds of years. The only problem is population control. In order to keep the population down, at the age of 30 you must be killed. The killings have been made into a celibration that people gladly go to and sacrafice there life. But some don't, Some try and Run, but no one has ever escaped untill now."
3,There's nothing sadder than a dead fish,"Michael York is delicious in this odd movie version of a rather frightening book, but with a script full of winner lines like the one above, and an ending that takes the teeth out of the author's meaning , it falls a bit short from its original inception. Additionally, the original age of compulsory death was 21, not the 30's, which ran more ice through the veins of the readers. Still, the concept is fascinating, and the dysutopia presented is alarming in its all-too-possible premise."
4,pretty good entertainment despite casting Michael York,"Ever since I was a little girl in 1970's, I have had Michael York fear. There are plenty of funny looking English actors whose talent make them highly watchable (Anthony Hopkins and Brian Cox come to mind) but Michael York's weird speaking style has always driven me totally nuts so I wasn't too happy to see him in Logan's Run which I only watched because of the funny mention of it in the Trekkies movie, Free Enterprise. Well, I loved Logan's Run and I am going to introduce it to little kids even though Michael York is in it. Michael York is great in the Austin Powers movies but not my cup of tea when he was being taken seriously in the 1970s. Anyway, this movie is so fun that Michael York is tolerable."
4,Clasic SiFi,"This is a classic SiFi with a BluRay makeover. A view of post-apocalyptic world where everyone over 30 must try to ""Renew"" or die. The twist is some doubt that renewal is the path and become ""runners"" looking for sancuary. Logan 7 is selected by the computer to find and destroy sancuary."
3,I remember now,"I remember now why Logan's Run was so popular even though it has a petty week story. All the girls in the movie wear nice short little tunics and are braless. This was big in the 70's and the dawn of the ""Burn the Bra movement"" not to mention the gratuitous skin display. All in all a pretty poor movie that brought back memories of a happier time."
2,Shouldn't have lived past 30,"The world of dystopian sci-fi movies contains several peaks and valleys. Some peaks: ""Planet of the Apes"" (the version with Charlton Heston, not the remake), ""The Time Machine"" (the George Pal version, not the remake), ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""Brazil,"" and perhaps a few others (I have a nostalgic fondness for ""Silent Running,"" for instance). The valleys are far too numerous to mention, but one of the classic examples is ""Logan's Run."" Watching it in the theater, at the age of 11, I remember thinking: ""What a dopey movie!"" It hasn't aged well in the interim. The most compelling dystopian sci-fi is that which bears at least a little possibility of becoming a reality someday (""A Clockwork Orange,"" for example, is probably already a reality); ""Logan's Run"" is so far ""out there"" that it's impossible to take seriously. As an expression of baby-boomer paranoia, it ranks right up there with Viagra commercials. Still dopey after all these years..."
3,Dreary film Concept but Visually entertaining,Michael York one of Hollywood`s forgotton icons in my opioinstars in a rather different subdued sci-fi film with amazingspecial effects. Set in the 2274 where ecological disaster hasmade civilazation a doomed existence the complex story revolvesaround a cerominial death where citizens die by the age of thirtyand in a city with no dieases free sex is encouraged. Logan(York) is a security guard-cop begans to fear for his own beingthat he will soon turn thrity and will be forced to die. So along with a `runner` he fleas through the underground to escapehis former counterpart out to destroy Logan`s rebelion. The film moved at such a slow pace i`m amazed it kept my atention.But I must admit LOGAN`S RUN is a interesting example of a socitey that is out of step with the real world.
5,Pretty good!,"(This review has spoilers.)I like the story especially the plot twist in the middle when Logan found out there's no Sanctuary! The joke's on the runners!And when Logan went back to the City, it made me think that Logan was like the first Neo, trying to convince everyone they were living a lie.The ending spoilt that, however. It opted for a simple fairy tale ending by destroying the City. A better ending for me would be Logan and Jessica leading more and more people to the Sanctuary, for real this time.One thing I didn't really get is when Logan turned good for real? It was never shown properly. He still ""paged"" his Sandman pals at the end of the tunnel, but then later he attacked them."
5,A classic,"This was my first viewing of this movie and I was pleasantly surprised at how well it holds up. While some of the effects and costumes are a teensy bit cheesy, the premise is thought-provoking and has stood the test of time."
5,Glad I got this on Blu-Ray,"Some brief observations:The picture quality is much sharper than the DVD.The surround sound comes ALIVE!The audio and music fidelity is stunning - the electronic music is piercing as designed.Scenes in The Love Shop seemed to have all the haze and smoke removed for a far more 'revealing' experience (don't know if this was the directors intention as this was rated PG)I know some of the acting is poor, there are plot holes, slow moments, even some silly ideas, but I loved this as a teenager and I still do. It's got cool visuals, great action, and some deep emotions and ideas. It's fascinating to see older movies when the only SP/FX were with matt paintings, real pyrotechnics, and intricate miniature models.Cool"
4,Good Viewing,"This is a realy well mad science fiction movie.Some say its outdated,but i think the plot is realy interesting.Its also a well made movie.But i must confess i thought the series of Logans Run was sensational when i saw it as a kid.I have not seen it since the 70's and i would definitly buy it if it came out on DVD.I like this movie and i would reccomend it to those who like Sci-Fi movies."
2,Pieces missing,"I won't talk about the quality of the actual movie but I will say that Warner ONCE AGAIN does it's usual sub standard job at transfering a classic movie from video to DVD. Just like Warner did with The Hobbit, and other classics, I've noticed very distinct scenes either missing parts or missing sound effects. If you have your old VHS or Laserdisc version, and it still plays, don't bother with this DVD."
1,Total silliness...,"Logan's Run might be entertaining if you're 10 years old and you're too naive to know any better. But for anyone much older than that, the movie is just embarrassing. Bad acting, bad special effects, you name it. If there are any good movies about people trying to escape from a repressive future society, this isn't one of them."
1,painfully boring,"I suppose it was revolutionary for it's time, but the acting is god-awful.Read the book, your imagination will do the story better justice."
1,Beyond Terrible,"I think people who see movies when they are children and grow up, so to speak, with movies have a total inability to separate the good and the bad. This movie is absolutely terrible. Even in 1976 these are just about the worst/cheapest effects possible. The story itself is interesting to a degree but the execution is LIKE an execution. Jessica/Logan are at least decent but there is just no excuse for the dialogue, the effects, the continuity of the story, the look of the film, or the direction.I rented this today and am a big fan of Star Trek, the original show, and even Planet of the Apes, the TV series, so I am open to great characters overriding aweful plots/effects but Logan's Run is just about as bad as it gets, almost on par with 'Dune', almost. This movie just doesn't stand the test of time."
1,This film is why Star Wars rocked the world,". . . because, before Star Wars, we had to watch befuddled backsewage like this!Just about the time you think the story is starting to make sense, the rug is pulled out from under you and the plot goes ga-ga. In thirty-odd years, I have never been able to decipher why the dome city self-destructs in the end, or, for that matter, why Farah Fawcett (age 29 and a TV superstar) was given a bit part while Jenny Agutter (age 34 and a bit chubby)was given the co-starring role. But I suspect that whatever was behind that directorial decision also explains why there obviously was no budget for a script."
4,"Logan's Run: Great Movie, Great TV series.","Logan's Run: It was great to see the movie for the first time. I had always wanted to see everything of the ""Most Memorable"" TV series."
4,A blast from the Past.,"It was refreshing to visit the World of Logan's Run. I was amazed at the detail and imagination, that the city took on in the opening sequence. The story gets a bit plodding at time but, the overall idea was interesting."
3,Good fashion with out-dated effect,Can be considered a good movie in the 80s but special effect is too dated. I felt that the fashion sense is stylish though some people may disagree. The transportation and gun look fake. Still watchable but cannot compared to modern science fiction movie.
3,"Another seventies sci-fi classic dinosaur, but it still reminds me of the good old days of matinees in the seventies","The music in the movie is really outdated. It tries to be futuristic but it just sounds so hooky. But, what I really enjoy about having this movie is seeing both Jane Agutter and Farrah Fawcett-Majors in beautiful High Definition.I don't have to explain the story, I'm sure. Because, if you're reading this you must have seen this movie long ago already, and you just want to know how well it looks in remastered High Definition. Well yes, it looks really good, although there are some grainy scenes, but that's expected for any movie over 30 years old. Wouldn't you think?Jane Agutter is the main reason why I bought ""An American Werewolf in London."" But anyway, this movie is well worth the less-than ten bucks that it sells for on Blu-Ray. I originally paid 16 dollars. I should have waited a little longer. Oh well."
4,Great,"Great movie. Special effects are dated, but for the 1980's it was great! I just hope that Amazon makes the TV series available in Prime."
4,Read the book too!,"Read the book before the movie was released (good grief, I was 10 then! Weird kid), enjoyed the book more but the movie was worthwhile."
4,"Can I ""camp"" all over your movie?","If you haven't seen this move for a couple of decades (like me), or you've never seen it and you would like to, be prepared for a look into the future as seen from the long, feathered hair and overly tight pants perspective of the late '70's.Modern ""Political Correctudes"" not-withstanding, there is some value in the plot of the movie. Plus the attitudes, speech, and costumes are good for a laugh if you can't get into the story-line.I recommend it only to those with an appetite for kitsch or a desire to study how people (or society) can really go wrong when thinking more than a couple of years into the future. Do keep in mind, however, that this was the state-of-the-art, cutting edge sci-fi back in the day. Oh, and this was one of the few films that qualified Farrah Fawcett to be a ""movie star"" (her part is actually more than one scene!)."
4,Fun classic; love the outfits!,"This is one of my all time favorite movies, it was fun to buy on DVD and watch with my wife - who'd never seen it before. The copy we bought was good, the movie was in great condition, and the extra's were a lot of fun to watch. At this price, I was very happy with the purchase.The movie itself is just as enjoyable now as it was years ago. Classic story, great FX, and good performances. Fun, sexy, sci-fi movie with the intriguing theme of a sealed world of pleasure and leisure ... but only room for the young. This movie has many classic lines and scenes, and a plot with multiple twists and surprises.They just don't make sci-fi movies like this any more and it's more then worth seeing!"
4,Peter Ustinov's acting is superb,"What an actor! Mr. Ustinov plays a nice old man in a way that i haven't seen before! I kind of remeberd this movie from its original release, but having the chance to see it again and listen to the director's and Michael York's comments really enhanced the experience. Though the sets may seem a little dull for today's standards, the overall message of the movie and the great sci fi story that it is make it worth buying. Although the DVD version offers no great differences to the VHS version, i think DVD will really take over in the next years, so better catch up with the future right now. If you're a Sci Fi lover, you should get this one."
2,Fantastically Cheesy,"For those who cut Logan's Run slack by saying it is a product of its time, allow me to point out that only three years later, Star Wars burst onto the scene, and 2001: A Space Odyssey came a full eight years before! Although it is clear that a lot of effort was put into the production, even as it steals from Metropolis and gives to the video game Myst, in the end, the unrelenting cheesiness cannot be overcome. This could have been a great film, but its chance for greatness was beyond the ken of those who created it."
4,Gift,"My dad is a big sci-fi fan, so movies such as Logan's Run are always a great gift. Plus he doesn't understand ""the whole blu-ray thing"" so it is a great deal buying standard DVD's."
2,"Good DVD, Sub par movie","Well, if you are a diehard Logan's Run fan, this DVD is for you. I can't say that I enjoyed the movie. What really made me laugh was listening to the Michael York Commentary when he states that the monster in the ice cave is the equivalent to Darth Vader. Really? Well, after watching the movie several times, I still dont know what that creatures name is, but I can guarantee that the majority of the English speaking world knows who Darth Vader is. If you are not a hardcore SF fan, I'd pass on this one."
3,I have forgotten how bizarre Logan's run was.,The quality of the movie was fine for a early 70's movie. If you are bored to death then its a good movie but keep your expectations low and you can lose. ;)
4,great movie,"Amazing for its time. Still great to watch even now. Great artistry - was made without much trendiness so that it is still relevant and attractive today, 35 years later; quite a feat!"
5,On a Carrousel,"Here is an oldie but a goodie, with a daybue of Farrah Fawcett.Micheal York does a great job of playing LOGAN. Justthink in this movie no one grows old and you can foolaround anytime with anyone. A great twist of whatparadise is like, until reality hits you. Then ""RUN""hence the title ""Logan's Run"" enjoy!Thank You"
3,Worth A Watch.,"Until quite recently, I had never seen Logan's Run. I can easily say that it's a pretty good movie that makes you think. The plot is interesting and there's no doubt that this is a creative movie. Michael York is a great actor and doesn't disappoint. I admit that it's not one of my favorite movies, but I still like it enough to have watched it a handful of times. An added bonus to the DVD is the director's commentary--this is very insightful and sheds a lot of light on things that may be unclear about the movie to some viewers. A fun, though-provoking movie that is worth a watch."
4,Thoughtful 70's Sci Fi,"Logan's Run belongs to a class of old school science fiction films which were popular in the early and mid-1970's, prior to the beginning of the Star Wars franchise. These films did not rely on non-stop action or dazzling special effects, but rather on thoughtful, intelligent stories, intriguing ""What if?"" scenarios, and astute social commentary. They included Sci Fi classics such as Soylent Green, The Omega Man, The Andromeda Strain, Westworld, and others. While the shopping mall setting and some of the special effects of Logan's Run are pretty cheesy, it is still an interesting film and its themes may be even more relevant in today's botox era than they were in the 70's. I have heard they are doing a remake and would like to think it will improve on the original. Unfortunately, given the recent history of Hollywood, it is more likely that they will drain every last bit of intelligence out of the story, and replace it with more explosions, and perhaps Will Smith."
2,WHERE ARE ALL THE EXTRAS???,"Am I the only one who remembers the 3 Laserdisc CAV box set that came out in the late 90's with ALL THE MIRACULOUS Bonus features for Logan's Run? 100's of stills, 2 mini docs, stills and script from Deleted Scenes and a whole lot more. Warner owns the same MGM material, there's absolutely no reason for them NOT to release it on this Blu ray. Pathetic"
2,Blu-ray version very disappointing technical quality,"My comments pertain only to the Blu-Ray version. The technical quality is very disappointing for me. The sharpness and detail does not compare to most of the other Blu-Ray titles I have watched. It is much improved over the DVD version, but that isn't saying much, because the DVD release of this title looked like a bad dub of a bad VHS tape. This Blu-Ray release is comparable to what the earlier DVD release should have looked like. The back indicates that it is released through the Turner and Warner Bros operations, so I suppose that says a lot. I wish that companies such as these would throw in the towel and turn this stuff over to companies that care at least a little bit about the quality of the product, as opposed to how much revenue it generates. They care only about how much revenue it generates, and for the most part could care less whether the technical quality is up to the standard for the media."
4,Logan's Run... still relevant,"This movie continues as a classic... and a cautionary tale. In our current world where we are using medical, genetic and computer technology to race to curing all the world's ills, the question remains; what do you want to die from? If we fix all the disease and death, will we then be asked if we want to renew at age 30? Will we have a perfect disease free life, and then our crystal turns red? This movie was made when sets were cheesy and low budget, however that meant the story had to drive the picture, not the flash. All the CGI in the world can't change the underlying message of logan's run, be careful what you wish for."
3,Blu Ray is only DVD quality,"Another old movie I saw in the theatre as a teen and loved, but this blu-ray release is not up to blu ray standards. For that, they only get three stars. I also have a DVD copy and would be hard pressed to pick the blu ray out in a side by side trial."
4,brings back memories,Picture is a little grainy.Other wise its a good movie. I saw it the theater when i was a kid.Price is very reasonable.
4,nice for old sci-fi movie,interesting. reasonable for old time movie. we have come a long way in making movies. I hope they were not using the frozen runners as food supply.
3,not as good as i remember it was,"when i was little(9 or 10) this movie came out and i got my parents to take me to see it. i loved it and bought the book and read it,boy what a change of pace the book was. that said the f/x in the movie look very dated now and the story is very slim and you can drive a truck through the plot holes, but there is some fun to be had watching this one if you let it be fun. just don't expect it to be as good as you remember it was."
4,I Like This Movie!,"I first saw Logan's Run when I was around eleven years old and I really liked this movie and thought it was good and I liked the entire cast but especially Michael York, Jenny Agutter, Richard Jordan, and Peter Ustinov and I'm glad that I bought this DVD because it is so nice to again see Logan's Run and to see it uncut!"
5,Excellent movie!,I have enjoyed this movie for years and I am pleased to see it finally coming out on DVD and with extras and a fabulous price!! It is interesting to note that the original age for people to die was 21 and not 30(read the book) but then Michael York could in no way pass for 21!Peter Ustinov and Jenny Aguter are two excellent actors who really make their characters believable. I loved all the cats when I was young and the images of the destroyed US civilization.
2,Cheesy but kind of fun,"This dystopian 1976 sci-fi clunker looks like it was filmed in a deserted shopping mall or office center, replete with fake greenery and piped in lifeless voices. Exteriors were obviously off the lot somewhere in southern California. The obviously fake model bubble city reminded me of Disney's Epcot. The acting is embarrassingly bad, and the script, well, it's also a message movie for its times when being over 30 was supposed to be like death. The special effects, such as they are, are cheap beyond words. Yet somehow this relic has remained as some sort of pop cultural icon. Watch it for its unintentional laughs. It's quite campy."
1,What a bunch of lies!,"I won't bore you with reviews that seem to go on for hours like some people do but instead I'll come straight to the point, this product does not work, period. But don't take my word for it, just conduct this simple experiment, fill it full of ice and let it sit overnight at room temperature and see if you don't have a cooler full of water the next morning. The conditions of my test are well within the parameters of the original test claims, those claims being that this cooler could keep ice solid for five days at ninety degrees. My question is how did the Igloo corporation come about such results when the ice in my cooler didn't even last overnight at roughly seventy five degrees? Maybe it's because they're a bunch of damn liars. Anyway, hang on to your receipt you're going to need it."
3,Cooler,"I had to return this item because it had a defect in it. one of the round buttons on the side popped off and I couldn't get it to stay in place. But they did accept the return, so I was happy with that."
1,Latch does not work,I purchased the Playmate version because I have the large Maxcold cooler which works great. Biggest problem with the Playmate is the latch does not work so it swings open unexpectedly. Very annoying. This is basically an oversized lunch box which dumps its contents when put on side. I do not recommend.
1,Not a cooler,"I purchased this cooler at a large retailer in Chicago (so I'm fairly certain it's not a fake if those even exist). This is a lunchbox, not a cooler. If I put drinks and ice in it, the ice is mostly melted within 90min and completely melted within 2.5hrs. My 10yr old handheld Coleman cooler (standard model, not 'maxcold' or anything like that) goes 4hrs before ice begins to melt and can keep drinks cold at least 8hrs, even in the summer sun. I think Igloo should spend less time on fancy product design and more on basic insulation. I don't understand the disparity in reviews for this product so I recommend moving to one with consistently positive reviews."
1,More Phooey and a focus on emotionalism,"too distract Americans away from doing a real investigation into 911. Fat chance though, nothing, not even hard evidence can compete with DENIAL."
3,Solid design... sad appearance,"The coasters do what they should do... protect your table and absorb water. That's great. The bad part is... don't expect them to look anything like the picture. These stones are 'printed' with the design, and there's no where near the amount of contrast/vividness you see in the picture. But don't get me wrong, they do the job."
2,Amber Glow coaster set,"The coaster set is OK but washed out and flat looking -- not anywhere as colorful as the picture. Probably would not have bought it if I could have seen the set in person. What happened to the ""Glow""?"
2,Impractical,"We bought these coasters thinking they would actually absord the condensation from our cold beverages. Instead, the moisture merely pools on top of the coaster so that every time you pick up your glass it drips on the coffeetable, the floor, you. They look nice but are not very useful. Plus, one arrived broken; cracked into three large pieces."
5,Person i gave them to for gift loves them,"these were a gift for Christmas and the person I gave them to say they are Very nice, sturdy, work well. Everything they wanted!"
2,Different coloring than shown,"While I was expecting a great mix of brown, beige, and black to go with some new furniture, these coasters had an overall pink hue to them. I love pink, but they did not go with this decor."
4,"Functional, solid","It's nice having a solid, sturdy coaster that won't stick to the bottom of your glass when you pick it up, and that won't soak through or create condensation where it shouldn't be. That's what I really wanted from a coaster, and that's what I got, so I'm happy there.The print on it isn't as sharp and vibrant as depicted (it's obviously the print before it's been applied to the non-smooth surface of the coaster), and when I unpacked them my husband asked ""what's it supposed to be? Nachos?"" That's EXACTLY what it looks like - a macro shot of nachos. So we call them the Nacho Coasters."
2,not as described,"I cannot speak for the product's usefulness. I am merely writing to say that these do NOT like at all like they do online. I bought them as a gift, mostly b/c of the bright colors and contrast. I thought I'd received the wrong set when I received them. The colors are much more muted, there is little contrast. All in all, not that attractive. Also, the box was ripped, so I'm hesitant to give them as the gift they were intended."
2,Got what I paid for,"The design is clearly a scanned image. They're fine to be used under a glass, but I wouldn'tbuy for their decorative value.Picture is much darker than the washed out version I received.b"
1,totally misadvertised,"The coasters are NOT glossy or made of pretty stones as they appear. They look like a cardboard printout picture of the rocks on top of a coaster. Absolutely dissatisfied and NOT at all worth the price. These look like something I would have paid 3 dollars for at a thrift store, not to mention I bought them new and they have clearly been used. DO NOT buy this item."
1,"Bad colors, Cracked when it arrived then cracked again when I dropped it","I got this for a present. When it arrived it was such cheap quality that I never gave it away. The color doesn't look deep and dark like the picture but red and flat. No one would ever mistake it for real stone. The sides of each thick coaster are not printed and look awful. It also didn't come with a holder for the coaster set. It arrived cracked and the first time I used it, it cracked again from falling off the coffee table. Do not buy, please!"
1,Fake photo surface,"Nothing like the picture. It'll cost more to return this junk than it will be worth so, I'll just live with them. Buyer beware, these are dollar store items, phony looking stone."
2,Looks bad.,"I can't recommend this product. Like the other reviews say, it's a scanned on image that looks awful. I'm returning mine and after I get my refund I'm going to buy some plain sandstone coasters."
5,"Strong beginning, middle, and end.","Please Do Not Disturb shows a more mature and very gifted Juliana Hatfield. Vocals, guitars, lyrics, everything here is top-notch. The songwriting remains focused throughout the cd, and is more diverse than Only Everything, and not as ambitious as Bed (which is a good thing) This makes an excellent introduction to Juliana's work - and has thus far proved to be one of her very best efforts."
1,Poor,"This book contains blurry reproductions of master drawings (Michelangelo, etc.), crudely executed original drawings, hard-to-read text, and at least one error in labelling. Better artistic anantomy books are out there. Three books come to mind: Paul Richer's Artistic Anatomy (from which some of the best drawings in Schider are taken), Eliot Goldfinger's Human Anatomy for Artists, and Stephen Rogers Peck's Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist."
4,An Excellent Source!,"This book is a very excellent source for any kind of artist who wants to learn anatomy. It starts at the basics (bone structure/skeleton) and works up through muscle and outer anatomy like skin. Although there are no words accompanying the sketches and diagrams - aside from captions - they are very clear and easy to comprehend. However, most of the pictures are of developed, athelete's muscles instead of ""average"" or even ""below average"" muscle build. It also does not include diagrams (only photos) of younger human anatomy (i.e. teenagers and young adults). Overall, this book is very handy to have around, especially if you're starting to get serious about your art."
3,A good book for amatuer artists,"The book gives clear, detailed pictures that will be helpful for the beginning artist."
1,Doesn't Work,"I've had this watch less than a month and it already quit working, I never had the chance to wear it."
2,flimsy,You get what you pay for I suppose. I recommend spending a few extra bucks and getting something that doesn't bow in the middle with a standard curtain on it.
4,The best chill out CD of the year,"For a CD that screams romance and relaxation at the same time, its about time this guy has come over stateside. Best thing to come out in stores this year."
2,Product is nice when it works,"Nice TV, great sound, great picture. Except that it doesn't always work -- the sound cuts in and out, and makes very loud popping sounds. And, Amazon.com does not provide any type of help, or exchanges on televisions this size. Their response to my request to an exchange was to contact JVC regarding their warranty service. Next time I'll by from a local company that will provide some SERVICE with their product."
5,I have Have this TV,Its a great TV! It was Running next to 25 Diffrent Tv's And its picture and sharpness was the best! Thats why I bought this and I'm sure you will be happy with it!
5,Scientific Answers,"Answers for Darwin by Ken Ham, Dr. Andrew Snelling and Dr. David Menton is an essential resource for anyone wanting to really know the truth about evolution. Whatever you believe, you owe it to yourself to listen to what these men have to say."
3,not true English Crunchie,"If you are used to the British made Crunchie, you will be disappointed. These are made in ""EU"" and taste different, with a more crumbly texture."
5,Yuuuuummmm!,"These are just like what we used to call sea foam. A little pricey, but I was glad to have found them. If you put them in the freezer to keep them fresh, it changes them a bit, and they are really crumbly -so eat it over a napkin!"
2,Still waiting,"Ordered them on october 26 and its now november 27 an still hve not received them. I have to say, they are priced well."
4,Seriously...great product!,"I am growing my chemically processed hair out. I've not had any chemical processing in 5-6months and I refuse to cut off the relaxed part of my hair so I'm in need of a great product. I have a natural wavy hair pattern and I decided to purchase this product based on a friends review. The Ultra Rich Treatment smells wonderful and works wonders especially when used with the ultra rich shampoo. If you're spending this much on conditioner why not buy the shampoo! This doesn't weigh your hair down and when rinsed you can comb from root to tip without a snag..wet or dry! When my 2-3hr hair styling/wrapping process is complete, my hair is softer and truly manageable. Kerasilk is a great product when dealing with dry, frizzy when it rains, natural & processed hair. I HIGHLY recommend Ultra Rich Care Treatment and the shampoo. I've used Super Skinny by Paul Mitchell, Nexxus, and Organic Root and this by far tops them all!"
4,Vinyl Sticker,"The sticker was easy to apply and has so far held up to washing. The car is only driven on nice days and almost never in the rain, so I don't know how it would hold up on a ungaraged vehicle. A friend of mine has had same sticker on his car for over a year and its holding up fine."
1,cranky makes me cranky,"My son, who just turned three, received this toy as a gift. It is impossible to put together, so he's constantly bugging me to do it for him. I struggle with this thing myself, and have to keep looking at the picture on the box in order to get it together correctly. It is especially difficult to get the top part of Cranky fitted onto the yellow revolving disc, and sometimes I just give up (to the sound of screaming and crying) because I am simply unable to get it to fit together. I'm obviously doing something wrong, since another review here says it's easy for a three-year-old to assemble! I much prefer regular Legos that kids can put together using imagination. This is something that has to be constructed just so, and it's a pain."
4,Everything's great except warrenty applies only for Canada,"I bought this TV about 3 months ago from amazon. Everything's great except product registration for warrenty. I live in US and this JVC registration applies only to products distrubuted in Canada by JVC Canada, Inc. I hope my TV will be in still good shape because I use it only in my bedroom, mostly for news and watch DVDs. This TV comes with auto volume adjustment for commercials but most voices for commercials are loder than normal voices in any program, especiall for Koon Tyson corner (I live in DC) and I can't bear that voice, so I have to change the channel during commercials. Otherwise, a great TV for bedrooms if you're not serious about warrenty."
5,tough knife,"I bought this knife for my son because I know this is a well made,tough knife.I have the black version of this knife and did my own version of a torture test on it.I accidentally stopped my car on top of mine.The knife had slid out of my cargo pocket of my bdu's,I started backing up,hit my brakes and slid the car on top of the knife for several inches.The side that the clip was on was on top,the bottom side has a long scrape where it slid on the concrete.The knife opened and closed like new,no noticeable change in the function of the knife.The car was a 91 camero,not exactly a light car.A knife that can stand up to that will probably last for a very long time."
2,Wish I had listened to earlier reviews,"My soon is Harry Potter crazy. So....I thought this is Mattel, it will be fine. Some of the reviews I read were negative, a few positive and I assumed the negative reviewers were just expecting too much for the money, as it is not an expensive item. When it arrived I was so disappointed. Its basically a carry case/storage box. It has one of the little characters and doesn't really even have enough features to support imaginative play. My son uses it to store his Harry Potter lego now and just gets it out when the Knight bus part of his dvd is on. Its probably better to spend a little more on a different product as you just end up trying to track down items to make it more usuable. In terms of the seller, I didnt have any problems there and it came really quickly."
3,beware of misprints in recipes!,"I love the diner, but this book looks to have some misprints compared to the copy we bought at the actual diner. Either that, or the one we bought at the diner was wrong."
3,"Less Diner, More Hippie","This cookbook wasn't what I expected. I had thought it would be vegetarian diner recipes, you know, like delicious greasy recipes minus the meat. Rather, this is a cookbook that's Really Healthy!I'd also heard so many great reviews about the Tofu Reuben that the restaurant made, so I'd expected it to be in the cookbook. I was shocked and totally disappointed when it wasn't there.If you're looking for a diner cookbook that has more lentils than cheese, this is for you."
4,Sweet (former) home Chicago,"When I moved away from Chicago several years ago, I knew that I would really miss the food. One of the things I missed the most was brunch at the Diner. I couldn't get enough of the biscuits & hash. Thanks to this book, I still get to enjoy it as often as I wish. For any ex-Chicagoan out there yearning for some of that tasty tempeh hash (and biscuits, and gravy, and scrambled tofu, and Ex Benedict...), click ""Add to Shopping Cart"" right now."
2,The FM Modulator is bad,I was told at the store this product has an excellent fm modulator. Very wrong. This was the reason i bought it and am very disappointed. Do not buy unless you have a direct hook up.
3,FM transmitter is weak at best!!!,"I'll make it short and to the point. Everything is great with the exception of the built in FM modulator. Signal strength from modulator to FM radio is weak at best.If you live in or around a major city with college radio etc. taking up most of the lower end of the FM band, don't expect fine audio. My unit is overpowered by local stations even though it's only 4 feet from my antenna.When other stations are not cutting in, there is a constant noticable hiss at all times. JVC support told me to purchase a hard wired FM transmitter. My advise to them was to make it work or don't sell it.My review was only to allert others of this flaw.I am also an XM subscriber and do not have this issue with my Roady unit."
1,Not great,"I've had this unit for a year and during that time, I've experienced the following:-Hissing no matter which FM station is chosen-Alert feature doesn't appear to work properly. Many times I am not alerted to the songs I have saved in my favorites. I'll turn the station and there's a song I have saved, but wasn't alerted.-The lighted display crapped out this weekend. It's dark.I am a Mom and don't ever remove this from my car. I rarely touch the unit and opt instead to use the remote. So the wear on it is minimal. It was a poor purchase at best."
1,Bad Unit!!,"This is the 2nd one of these I have had, and the 2nd one my husband has had. The first two we got for X-Mas 2004 and were returning them both to JVC by Nov 2005. JVC gave us a horrible time, but since it was under warranty, they replaced both of them.Now, tonight, my light sensor per JVC has gone out and they won't replace it. I can ship it to them and they will look at it for $65 and then diagnose it. Well.. the lady told me over the phone what the problem was. Then she said they will charge me to fix it, then ship it back.WHAT??? I don't even know what to do. She suggested calling Circuit City or Best Buy for repair... both of them say NO WAY!!Well....not such good luck.When this unit works.. it is great... but we have had 4... and issues with all them..Good luck!"
2,"Dated design, better units available","I purchased one of these when new back in 2004. The unit has worked ok for me, with the main quirk being about once every hour or two, I go through a 3 - 5 minute period of bad reception, presumably as it shifts from one satelite to another. I was unable to utilize the fm modulator as it was weak, but went to a hard wired connection to my radio using a cable purchased from Crutchfield.My main issue with this unit is that there are newer units available for the same or slightly more money, which have replay options and better displays. I would consider those options before purchasing this unit."
4,Plug N Play Sirius Radio,My husband's Sirius satellite radio like this had stopped working so we were thrilled to find a new one! They seem to be hard to find. The response time was great and they shipped right away!! Thanks!!
1,Very Disappointed,"I own this JVC unit and the XM Roady 2 unit so I can make a good comparison. The XM Roady 2 blows this unit out of the water. Immediately after getting JVC Sirius Satellite receiver it started to overheat and then shut down. It is very heavy in comparison making it more difficult to mount in a vehicle. It falls down from the weight. My XM Roady 2 is very light, never overheats and was easier to mount.I contacted JVC about the problem and they had me return the unit at my own expense weeks ago and have informed me since that they have accidentally sent the unit back to someone else who was having problems. I guess that means I'm just SOL. Luckily I have had my XM ROADY 2 for over a year and am thrilled with it. I plan to buy another one to replace the JVC in the other vehicle."
2,carbon pump,"This is good as backup pump for another pump. Not for road as someone said, ""Not 120PSI (you or the pump will pass out before you get there."" For MTB it would work."
3,Little battery clock chime in a solid brass bell,"I like the clock for the most part, and was worried the chime may be too loud. You can not turn it off without taking it apart to access the bell switch. Since putting it on the stand, there is hardly any sound anymore. The sound holes on the clocks body for some reason are perfectly placed right over the wooden stand, thereby totally blocked. Its apparent now that this clock is really meant to be hung, so that the sound holes on the bottom will continue to function. It would of been better if the holes were on the sides or top! Now I just hear a little ting, if I manage to hear anything."
4,Where have I been,"I'm late to find this author, but I will make up for lost time. Very different take on a detective. Let's see how it goes from here. Don't expect the usual."
2,The Long Legged Fly - Review by Mario Baldassarrini,Not very interesting - I have read this book some time ago and I don't remember what it is about.
3,A classic that changed the world,"This book was the first book to describe Structured Design and remains the most thorough. It improved the way thousands of people designed software. The majority of the concepts that today make up object oriented design are addressed in this book. These include coupling, cohesion, factoring and encapsulation (called information clusters here). The authors Ed Yourdon and Larry Constantine are exellent writers, but this, one of their earliest books, is far from their best work. I still have and occasionally refer to my copy for this book. However, the best book on this subject is The Practical Guide To Structured Systems Design by Meilir Page-Jones."
3,for the collection ??,"again, good solid stuff from hope and more for the serious collector, pity though it only comes with a handful of songs -pair the two EPs and you have a nice short CD"
2,Infomercial Alert,"I am very disappointed at the amount of this video that was just an advertisement for the facility, testimonials included. I can not believe I paid for a video that was trying to sell me something else. I fast forwarded through much of the video once I realized what the deal was.Now that I have vented, I will admit that at the end of the video there were a few recipe demonstrations that seemed would be good.I did not like this DVD and can not recommend it. I have purchased about 7 raw food DVDs. My top picks for more are Raw Food Made Easy by Jenny Cornbleet and Living on Live Food by Alissa Cohen. Both are currently available through Amazon with a coordinating cook book. Now I am tring to get you to buy something else, but you did not have to pay for the review."
2,Pretty lame,I thought this DVD would be sort of a documentary but it turned out to be a two and a half hour infomercial. I give it two stars because some of the class excerpts were kind of interesting.
3,A real tough one...,"and a very hard book to review. If you read it, read it carefully. One suggestion I've heard was to read and ponder the first 3 parts, but don't just believe they're true because they're in the book. Another suggestion I've heard is ""Don't put it down when you read something new or strange, put it in the back of your mind and just move on. Let them digest in your mind as you read the whole work.""The fourth part (The Life and Teachings of Jesus) is great. Our survival as a species and as a planet can be spared and brought up from the murky depths we've sunk to by accepting the fact that WE KNOW NOTHING and maybe we need to start thinking outside of the box."
5,The Urantia Book,I'm still reading this book. It is very heavy reading and alot of thought must go into what it says. It is very interesting but tedious.
5,way of living,"this book has 34 pgs. table of contents 2097 pgs if you ever wanted to know who god is whats he like the life of jesus yr by yr and some reasons why we are the way we are,this is it.also some things written in 1955 are just now coming to light in the scientific community.all in all its a great philosophy of a higher way of living that i recommend its a revelation to say there is an actual fragment of our father who reserves of his own volition to indwell the human mind in a superconscious way sounds deep yeah,it can be but very refreshing as a working theory for those who think religion is a personal experiance between us and whomever we believe our maker to be"
5,You gotta read it,"I discovered the Urantia Book in 1971 and fortunately had the time to read and study it then because it takes a bit of effort to get acquainted with the concepts and word symbols used to convey meaning. But, for me, this book describes the workings of God's Universe of universes--from the most spiritual to the most physical--in ways no other single source can. To evaluate it or to allow it to affect your life, you gotta read it."
1,Bad Science Fiction,"The Book Of Urantia is nothing more than bad science fiction and superstitious foolishness. This is a contrived piece of nonsense unworthy of study except as a curiosity. Science and Reason lead to the truth not works like this which although obviously the work of men, claim to be otherwise. If anything should be considered sacred it is life itself, not the supernatural or the false hopes that beliefs in it provide. This book is full of false hopes and beliefs.""If you would be a real seeker after truth, it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things."" -Descartes."
1,Garbage,"One of the most ridiculous books I've ever read in my entire life. The assumptions are conspiracy-based and really betray human intelligence. I don't believe celestial beings, custodians, space aliens or any ideas of that sort are helpful to the human condition. I just don't see the point. Sorry but these kinds of books belong on the shelf with and alonside those that they criticise as nothing more than end of the age hoo-haw and spiritual garbage. Why do people incessantly write books and theories that ascripe intelligence to somewhere other than where it actually resides. This and other new age throw-aways represent an all out war against personal responsibility and the human intellect. Farewell to the age of reason."
1,"New Agey version of the Bible, PEOPLE! COME ON!","I always try to keep an open mind to alternative explanations of earth, god, and the universe, and gave this book a try. First of all, this book reads like the bible, feels like the bible, and has most of the bible's stories all mixed up!!!! For a Christian that wants to open up to some alternative ""Christian Stories"", this book might be good. But I just found this book a very new agey version of the Bible [...]If you want to search deeper meaning beyond what we know about our race, how we got here on earth without the mother goose story, read something else."
2,Brilliant Fiction,"A better, clearer and much more detailed and imaginative creation than the bible. For over 25 years I believed. Slowly the racism ate at its beauty. When I learned of the mass eugenics movement of the early part of this century the bubble weakened. And when the plagerization became common knowledge, my personal belief bubble burst. Brilliant Religious Fiction, but sadly, just a product of its time. My name changed with my last marriage 20 years ago to honor the star of the book; Christ Michael."
5,THE Revelation for our times.,"This book purports to tell you all you ever wanted to knowabout the nature of God, his Universe, the story of howEarth was created and why, the truth about Adam, Eve, Satanand above all the most comprehensive story(about 800 pagesworth) of Jesus and his mission on Earth.Read it once and treasure it for always."
5,Sincere Seekers Rejoice!,"I spent many years dabbling in metaphysics, Eastern Religions, Timothy Leary, Ram Das and even Sri Aurobindo and Alice A. Bailey. But nothing prepared me for having REAL ANSWERS! Then, I was introduced to THE URANTIA BOOK and began to grow in wisdon, understanding, and eagerness to be about the Father's Will. This was nearly thirty years ago. I have been so completely satisfied with this great work, that I am involved with two weekly Study Groups devoted to a deeper knowledge of this superb work. Hint: if you're convinced that there's more to know about Jesus of Nazareth than the Holy Bible tells us, this book is what you're been seeking. Read it and know God's blessings."
1,MAY I PLEASE DIRECT THE SEEKER TO THE REVIEW ...,"... written June 10th 1999 by the intelligent and sincere individual in California. This review should say it all. Apparently, there is even empirical evidence this book can be measured against.Sounds to me in reading all of this stuff that this book created a something not unlike a 'Course in Miracles' or 'Michael-speaks'-style epidemic for the hyper-metaphysically-inclined. It's a shame. God, give us something else to do with our minds, please. Well, now, I suppose that's up to us, isn't it!"
1,philosophy for the new age or crap for small minds??,"This book is not a bold new philosophy or a new envigorateing revelation.If you want real enlightning philosophy i sugest you study some actual theology,i sugest Thomas Aqainus or a more contemporary theologin would be Frank Sheed.I if you want real answers you wont find it here Instead youll find racist opinions and really poor science with a healty dose of superstition!!"
2,questionable accuracy,way over the head of most people.Keeps refering to 'jesus of Nazareth' there was no historic town of nazareth at that time.if this was written by spiritual beings they would already know this!
3,massive spirituality,"massive. manic.appears thorough, but to read somethingmore closely shows wandering connectionsand unfinished arguments. Very, very entertaining, however."
3,"Ok, Small type","I got weary from the intense concentration because the type is sosmall. It takes the joy out of reading, and studying. I have torepeat going over the material to make sure I didn't miss a thing.KEEP READING YOUR BIBLE, this is not THE ONLY ANSWER, though it maybe to many respectively."
1,Made me literally sick,"I'm a Christian who loves to study my Bible and other religious writings. When I first began reading the Urantia papers I was mentally intrigued but became literally sick to my stomach. After praying about what I was reading I realized that these words about God's creation and His plan were not from Him at all. The more I read, the more I saw how the teaching in the papers contradicted Biblical doctrine (there are far too many to address in this setting). Be warned that these papers do not represent the truth found in the Bible. Jesus said take heed that no man (or spirit) deceives you. There is undoubtedly a master plan for this planet and mankind. God has a plan and so does satan. If you enjoy good science fiction, you might enjoy the Urantia papers; if you want to hear from the Creator Himself, read the Holy Bible - truly the most amazing book ever written. Your eternal destiny is determined by who's plan you choose to believe and follow."
1,c'mon!,"With respect, I must disagree with another poster's assumption...:""""""""In the middle of the book, just tucked away, is a description of the Star of Bethlehem which notes the birth of Jesus as August 21, 7BC. What the book states is that the 'star' was really the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter on May 29th, September 29th and December 5th. Well, I asked a computer literate friend to check that out for me and look from Cairo, Egypt. Using mapping software called Mystars he checked.His reply? ""The conjunctions took place and are viewable at 0200 hours on May 29th, 1800 hours on September 29th and 1300 hours on December 5th. Quite Amazing!"" This might cause people to wonder why such a verifiable fact would be just 'tossed in' a tome of 2097 pages. """"""""---------------If your friend can use free online softeare to determine whatever this event is, couldn't someone else have easily done likewise? This book was written in the internet age, not the rennaisance."
2,Do you want to sell the book,"I have ordered this book since the first week of july and still haven't seen it shipped. Today is august 18th!!!!What are you thinking of guys!I bought it, please send it over. Are you just now printing it?Why does it take so long?Randall"
5,Overview Of The Urantia Book,"Seldom do you find a book that has so much concentrated truth. It is transcendent in its scope and beyond any other in depth.It begins by describing the attributes of God, the make up of the physical, mental and spiritual universes, and ends with the story of Jesus' life as you have never heard it before. Every confusing aspect of the Bible, of Buddhism and of Islam is cleared up and built upon.When you are ready for truth, you are ready for the Urantia Book.Good reading my friend, you have found the pearl of great price, don't overlook it because it doesn't appear in a way you thought it might.Enjoy, you owe yourself this one."
5,If immortality is a desire of yours read on.,"For many years I have studied this book and I have found it to be a reliable source of information and inspiration. The conflicts between science and religion are reconciled with an amazingly detailed and scientific overview of the genesis , history and destiny of mankind. We are not alone becomes a consistent message of hope and comfort as you learn of the myriad of celestial helpers and spiritual guides all working with the human personality and the spirit within to evolve an immortal soul capable of embarking on the ultimate adventure, the quest of the ages, eternal life."
1,Masterpiece of Deception,"I am a born-again Christian with the spiritual gift of discernment. I have to warn you, and this is what I know: this book contains much truth, but ultimately it's a work of high-level demons (fallen angels) whose purpose is to lead you away from the Word and His grace. Do not underestimate the serpent, for Satan is a crafty enemy, and even if he appears to ""help and enlighten"", his true purpose is to deceive and destroy. I will offer no argument for my position except for this one: the spirit authors of the book always call Jesus the ""Master"", but never once ""Lord"". In the Bible Jesus is always the Lord. You know who your Lord is, they know theirs. Keep that in mind if you read the book."
2,Years of study have left me very uncomfortable with this,"Do not read this book without its companion by Martin Gardner. Despite any hype regarding its origin or supposed breadth, it was developed by men, with all of their biases clearly revealed. It is intriguing for all of us who want to understand far beyond the sunday school version of Chrisitianity . However this is not what is purported by its adherents. An interesting ride but not the answer. I would particularly admonish people of color not to take this one seriously. You decide after reading both."
1,More new age mysticism,The Urantia BookNo accurate way to date the earth; mixes new age mysticism with science and twist the truth of God's Word.
1,Utterly ridiculous!,"The Urantia Book is not worth your time or money! Any thinking person can see it is a hoax just by looking at some of the names of places such as Morontia (must mean it is a place for morons!). Other ridiculous names include Ganad (what if that first a were an o!) and Adamson.Reading this book is totally confusing. Don't bother! Read the Bible, the Bhagavad Gita, the Torah or some other spiritual scripture, but pass this one by!"
3,"Interesting, But Complex","Although I have not read the entire book (which is over 2,000 pages long), from what I have read, it's definately interesting, as well as a mind-opening experience. There are parts of the book that are really interesting, and then there are others parts that are confusing and hard to understand, which is why I rate this book 3 stars instead of 4.This book is definately NOT for someone who loves pictures (there are no pictures to be found here), or does not enjoy reading, and learning. It's also not book that one can just breeze through easily. It requires one to think, and be inquisitive.If you like to learn about different religious/spiritual beliefs, you might find this book worthwhile. I would also add that this book is for a mature audience. Don't be swayed by EVERYTHING you read here!"
4,The Urantia Book,Very interesting book. Hard read at the first so went to part about Jesus's life and it wasvery good and easier read.
4,The Urantia Book,I purchased this book because I belong to a book discussion group and this is the current book we're working with. Perhaps there could have been a better description as to the contents of the book. I would have bought it anyway but for others not familiar with the material this would be helpful. It is an eye opening interpretation of the life and teachings of Jesus not found in any Bible . It is much more descriptive of all the events surrounding Him.The first part of the book will give an in depth look at the Universes.Fascinating. Read it with an open mind.
5,Urantia Book application,"If the Bible is an operations manual for life, then the UB is the service manual, with circuit diagrams nuts and bolts. It gives perspective from the top down as well as from the bottom up. Just keep an open mind and verify."
5,A challenge,"I first read the Urantia Book, in hardcover form in 1977. I didn't know what to make of it since it included things that went way beyond and sometimes contrary to what I had been taught in my religious upbringing. Even today, having spent 35 years with it, I find it difficult to find people to share it with, although it has, by now, been translated into many languages and is an international bestseller.If you're happy with your beliefs about the universe and this planet, this is NOT the book for you. On the other hand, if your current beliefs, or lack thereof, have you looking for something else to explain what's going on in the world, I highly recommend this book. It's not an easy read, but the more you stay with it, the more it becomes apparent that our world is still in the dark ages when it comes to cosmology.After 35 years of reading it, the Urantia Book still is refreshing and challenging."
5,Learn what Jesus taught,"If you really want to know and understand what Jesus taught while he was alive not so long ago, you might want to read this book. Part IV, The Life and Teachings of Jesus is just facinating. Imagine a true narative of Jesus' teachings. No one can read it and not be affected by his love. ***Rick Decker Scotch Plains NJ"
4,Interesting read,I haven't got throught the book it is more of a reference type encyclopedia but there are most certainly interesting things to think about
3,Mythology linked with Bible truth,"Some truth is found in everything. The truth in this book is decided by the reader. An open mind is needed. I found it thought provoking. As a christian I had decided to read it just to see someone elses' prospective on how we came to inhabit the universe. This is definately not the ""big bang"" theory. Mythology shows us ""gods"" with each one having different powers. That statement is not so different from the one true living God, The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit combined as the Holy Trinity. This is not for someone with a closed mind."
1,Nazi Propaganda,"This book promotes eugenics, although it took me until about page 700 to figure it out. This is merely Nazi propaganda that tries to make the obliteration of certain races of people seem beneficial to the rest of the human race. Anybody that loves Adolph Hitler will love this book. I don't. I don't fault anyone for this except myself. I should have done more research to begin with. I spent $15 on crap."
4,The OC Bible?,"I picked up a copy of the Urantia Book about a year ago and have gone wading into it on several occasions. The book is somewhat enigmatic to me as it has a very futuristic feel, yet has a dedicated group of followers who hold it out as a Divinely inspired message. I've not regretted my decision to buy it although I find it difficult to say exactly what it is about it that keeps me coming back to read some more.For what it's worth to anyone contemplating the purchase, be prepared for a slow read. I'd recommend this book to anyone, if for no other reason than the sheer scope of it but it's not a book one picks up for a leisurely read. Even if it is a work of fiction as some contend, it's still a monumental piece of work that clearly was meticulously crafted. I feel that, regardless of how you may choose to view it, the book stands on its own merit as one well worth a look."
5,A Revelation,"The Urantia Book is a book of spiritual truths meant to enhance all faiths. It gives a clear picture of the nature of God, how He organizes His evolving universe and where we fit into His plans for ultimate perfection of the universe and his children.The book claims to be a revelation and says it is not the last revelation. It explains that God is very willing to reveal Himself to us as we become more and more capable of understanding Him.It fills in the gaps which we have in history, science, and astronomy. It reveals information that we could otherwise not be able to know because of lack of records of our history and because of our position in space which makes us unable to see all of the evolutionary universe.It is a must read for all who are willing to expand their consciousness of this life and their beliefs."
3,do yourself a favor and buy the imports,"Bar-None had the right idea...release these two groundbreaking recordings on one CD. Unfortunately they either received second or third generation masters from RCA or the tape to disc transfer was done using so-so equipment. Comparing this release to the two rare individual import CDs (yes they are out there) there is simply no contest. A beautiful high end rules on the imports, which is rolled off tremendously on the Bar-None version. There is even a little better low frequency extension and wider dynamic range on the imports as well. One thing is for sure, you want WILD AND CRAZY arrangements, then these recordings are for you...just seek out the imports."
4,Smells great!,"I washed my vehicle ONCE since purchasing this product. I researched many car wash soaps before finally deciding on this one. My car is completely wrapped in 3M vehicle graphics. I really had to be selective in the brand and type of soap I use. The 3M vehicle wrap technical section on the 3M website recommended this soap for my particular application. I conveniently ordered 4 bottles to keep in stock. The bottles aren't very large. I do admit the smell is great, if you like the scent of cherries, of course. I was quite surprised when I began to pour the product into a bucket of water. The soap formula is thin liquid, not thick like I envisioned. With that in mind, be careful when you start pouring, otherwise you'll end up pouring the whole bottle into the bucket in one shot. The soap does foam up nicely and rinse off nicely as well."
3,Bitterly disappointed!,"What were they thinking?! The traditional music is one of the best parts of the Sharpe series (okay, Sean Bean is pretty great too), but on this CD, John Tams's beautiful singing, which is totally appropriate to the era on the series and one of the highlights, has been tarted up with completely inappropriate and overbearing instrumentation. If I'd wanted folk-rock, I'd have bought a Steeleye Span CD! I'm giving this 3 stars only because the singing itself is good (Barry Coope does a nice job with the harmonies, as one would expect of one-third of the superb Coope, Boyes and Simpson), but the overall presentation is painfully incongruous with the material. I'd have preferred an entire CD of John Tams singing a cappella to this.As an aside, I can take or leave the instrumental numbers. I'm also not a Kate Rusby fan. Why didn't they get Eliza Carthy or June Tabor if they felt they needed a female singer?"
4,Over The Hills And Far Away: the music of Sharpe,This CD is well done. It aids well in developing a feeling for the times.
5,Great Music,"If you like the movie series, you will really like this CD. I wish there was more marching music on it, but other then that, its a great mix."
4,Good old fashioned church,This is one of the best compilations of traditional gospel I've heard in a while. You owe it to yourself to check this one out!
3,Two Ewok Movies?,"Hi, I was surprised to find that there are two ewok movies. As a kid I remember watching The Ewok Adventure: Caravan of Courage and of course seeing them in Return of the Jedi. So, this is another movie on them. When did it come out? Is it as great as the others?"
1,A pathetic genre film,"If you are a non Star Wars fan, don't see this movie. Bottom line. This movie does not stand up to objective adversarial viewing. It is a weak-plotted and shodily made film. My girlfriend a huge Star Wars freak, with a capital ""F"", made me sit through this boring, loosely premised dung-fest and I wanted to stick a chopstick in my eyes, like some kind of asian oedipus. Be smart, stick to the triliogy."
3,"Like the movie, but there is a much better copy available!","I really like this version of the Maltese Falcon almost as much as the 1941 Bogart version. However, the print is terrible. However, you can get an excellent copy by buying the Bogart Signature Collection Volume II, along with Satan Met a Lady (a forgetable version of the Maltese Falcon!) and a bunch of other good Bogart classics!Humphrey Bogart - The Signature Collection, Vol. 2 (The Maltese Falcon Three-Disc Special Edition / Across the Pacific / Action in the North Atlantic / All Through the Night / Passage to Marseille)"
3,Original Maltese Falcon Film,"This is the first filming of Dasheill Hammett's classic detective story. It predates the John Huston/Humphrey Bogart version by ten years and follows the novel closely. Ricardo Cortez makes a much more smarmy Sam Spade than Bogart, and the pre-code production makes explicit much of what Huston had to hint at. It's worth watching, if only to compare it with the 1941 version and marvel at the inspired casting that made the later work one of the greatest mystery films ever."
1,Dangerous Female,The DVD was of extremely poor quality (when it played) frequent stops. Unable to play at all at about 20 min. into the film.
2,Interesting as film history,But no comparison to the later version. I was surprised to see so much of the dialog the same.
2,Misleading and Sappy,"Like others who have written about the Chosin campaign, Brady fosters the impression that the First Marine Division (and the accompanying army divisions) might have succeeded had it not been for the cruel weather. In truth, the freezing weather decimated the Chinese and, hence, probably saved the Marine and army divisions from being annihilated. Had the weather been good, there would have been no way that 30 thousand Marines and soldiers could have survived battle with 120 thousand Chinese.Aside from this, I found Brady's book to be rather sappy with its frequent and boring flashbacks to Capt. Verity's wife and daughter, and I found its end to be totally predictable from the outset."
3,A Freezin' Season,"Robert Louis Stevenson once said: ""It is better to travel hopefully, than to arrive"". I anticipated an eventful trip to the Chosin Resevoir, but instead was captured by elegaic prose. The best war stories are about the people who fight the wars, not the people at home.The construct of Verity reminiscing for live and dead family members was distractive and detracted from the essence of the story.At times, I felt that the book wasn't thoroughly researched. Some of the action scenes seemed as though they were skim-coated. I wish the book were more compelling, because that campaign truly symbolized the futility of war."
2,Less than gripping,"Initially, I was very interested in reading this book having read Breakout by Martin Russ, which I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend highly. It started off well, then Mr. Brady attempted to write words from the mouth of Captain Verity's 5-year-old daughter. My daughter is 6 and she never once spoke like Verity's little girl. Then again, my daughter doesn't have a French nanny like Tom Verity's does. Maybe little girls who do speak differently.I also wasn't quite sure what the flashbacks to his wife, and the privileged life they led prior to her death, had to do with the withdrawal from the Chosin Reservoir. If it was an attempt to get inside Tom Verity, to understand him, it failed to do that for me. I felt nothing for him and was not saddened by his death. He seemed to be an eyewitness looking at everything from afar. Even his understanding of Chinese wasn't much help to anyone. Tom Verity never seemed to really be there."
2,Not in Same League,"Though well-written, this novel by Brady is not up to other embellished true accounts of the Korean War by such as Martin Russ. In fact, it is not as instructive or interesting as Brady's own ""The Coldest War"". The novel is a man of letters' tour of part of the war, and is not as hard-hitting as the true story. Does every journalist have to get a novel into print?"
1,Worst piece of historical fiction I've EVER tried to wade through,"This book was HORRIBLE! If you deleted all of the flashbacks to the main character's dead wife, all of the letters he wrote to his three-year-old daughter, and just half of his life growing up in China, you might have a 150-page book. You'd have a short story if you deleted half of the holier-than-everyone-else Marine chest beating, e.g., the Marines were the only ones who knew that the Chinese were attacking in Korea, the Marines single-handedly won the Pacific Theatre of WWII, the Marines were the only troops fighting in Korea (everyone else was running), the Army staff were all idiots, the Marine staff were all brilliant leaders, and on and on, ad nauseam. I also noticed that the author wasted no opportunity to covertly snub the Army by using lower case ""the army"" throughout the book when referring to the U.S. Army. Real cute. This book had about as much substance as the gossip columns he wrote for the newspaper."
2,A very cold book,"The dust cover declaration that this book is the Korean War's Iliad is simply preposterous. It is, rather, a mundane, often boring, account of how frozen bodies are handled in a wartime setting. There was not a single surprise in the book. I have no idea what Verity, the protagonist, is like as a human. And bad enough that, of all names, Verity, was selected, but then to write an exposition of its possible Latin translation takes this book from Greek classics to the sunday comic strips. The repetition of whole paragraphs is an interesting and disconcerting ploy. I kept asking myself, didn't I already read this page? I read a lot and this book just dosn't measure up to the talent that is otherwise out there. I was left cold."
1,the marines of autumn,the worst book i ever read. the book devolves into an imagined loss of personal control because of the cold. no military or histoic plot after the first half. i want my money back. only a anti marine slob could rate this trash above no stars
3,not even close,"Emblazoned across the top of this book is the following quote from Kurt Vonnegut: ""The Korean War now has its own Illiad...""Even accounting for the normal hyperbole designed to stimulate impulse buying, this book does not come close to living up to that lofty billing.The book is interesting . . . particularly the descriptions of the unrelenting Chinese assaults, the harrowing retreat to the sea and the human depravities borne by 24-degree below zero temperatures.If that was all there were, this book would rate five stars. Instead, there were too many flashbacks to the protagonist's too-perfect deceased wife, too many redundancies and too much Maggie Higgins. I also found the author's continual penchant for venting his spleen about Gen. MacArthur a bit disconcerting."
3,The Marines of Autumn,"I refer specifically to the Parade article by the author (James Brady) - ""Is Korea really the forgotton war? Not if you ask the foot soldiers who fought there, Marines and Army both. I would like to remind Mr. Brady that the Navy was there too. For over three years I steered those landing ships that carried the foot soldiers, their tanks and equipment, at virtually every invasion and evacuation during the war, plus serving as a mini hospital ship for helicopters to bring wounded back from the front lines and to ferry communist prisoners to the Koji Island POW Camp. For the information of all the LST (Landing Ship Tank) was the work horse of the Navy in Korea and I proudly served on one for the entire ""forgotten war"". Mostly I have tried to forget it during the past 50 years, but articles and books like these tend to bring it all to the surface. For ALL of us who served there it will never be the forgotten war. Wally Carroll, Everett, Washington."
3,OK book but....,"The book was interesting for the first part but then it got kind of repetitive in the sense that every other segment was about Verity thinking about his daughter but not really saying what he was thinking. Also I'm wondering what were the sources Brady used when writing this historical fiction? I didn't see a bibliography at the end, did I miss or was there not one? Otherwise it would have been a good and touching tale."
3,Good buy,"This was a required text book for a class. It was a good price, but I rarely ever used the book."
1,Who wrote this book?,"This is an overly complicated book appropriate for honors chemistry majors. Compared to other books in this category, it is not as easy to work with.The biggest question has to be why Peter Atkins is even writing books in this category. He is a British physical chemist and everyone knows that British universities do not teach general chemistry. So, is this really a Loretta Jones book with Atkins name, because he is famous, or is Atkins crossing over?"
4,THE COLLOGE 1ST SEMESTER HONORS CHEM BOOK,"I used this book for my 1st semester Honors Chemistry class at Cornell University (CHEM 215). Even though Chem is not my favorite science subject (I'm an electrical engineer, so I prefer physics instead) I have to say the combination of book and professor (Benjamin Widom), makes me remember that class as my favorite one during my first semester at Cornell. I wouldn't listen too much to the negative reviewer (Who wrote this book?). The book is not bad at all; it is just focused towards students who are going to be majoring on Chemistry (Pre-Meds). But that doesn't make it ""bad"". I do recognize that there are some typos in this edition that our professor easily corrected (that's why I gave it a 4 and not a 5)."
2,"Mediocre, at best","So what if UCLA uses this as their primary freshman text? UCSD (where I go), MIT, and other schools use it too, and every student I've met agrees that this book is sub-par. It isn't as clear as it can be, is bereft of example problems that apply to the homework, has at least a few mistakes per chapter in the solutions manual, spends way too much time deriving some (useless) things more applicable to physical chemisty, etc."
3,Not a traditional cinnamon smell,"I was hoping for a more traditional cinnamon smell, more along the lines of simmering cinnamon sticks...this is not it. This smells more like an Indian spice mix. The new Gonesh sticks do,however, seem to burn longer and with less smoke. I will try another ""flavor"" at a later date."
2,Highly Predictable,"I don't want to spoil the story but I had all of the important plot and some of the not so important plot points figured out about a quarter of the way through this book. Meaning that I knew who the bad guy was, I mean who he truly was very quickly, and knew exactly how the rest of the story would turn out by the end of the first 100 pages. The language is corny, stereotypical characters, and an incredibly predictable plot. I like mysteries and supsense stories but don't reveal the entire plot so quickly. There was also something off about a mystery writer writing a story about a myster writer, wow what a stretch of the imagination."
2,Ho-Hum Who Done It,"The trouble with this book is that the murderer is so easy to figure out. I find it hard to believe that anyone was surprised. Not only that, but it was incredibly simple to know the reason why this person was a murderer. The clues were like neon signs! I held out hope until the end that I was wrong, but no, there it was, exactly as I had surmised. Erica Spindler tried to throw in a lot of red herrings, but they fell flat. Frankly, I thought the book was a little amateurish, even though I know Ms. Spindler has written several other books. Maybe I'll try one of her other ones, and see if it is worth the read."
4,Good read!,A strong story with well developed characters. Another nice mystery tale by Spindler. Looking forward to reading more from her.
5,Erica Spindler is one of the best murder mystery writers out there!,"If you've never read a murder mystery by Erica Spindler, you MUST read!!! Step aside James Patterson! She keeps the reader on the edge of their seat and engaged through to the end! Once I start reading one of her books, I am committed and wind up reading the whole thing in a few days. I find them hard to put down and once I am done reading long for another. Bone Cold was no exception!"
4,Spine tingling tale!,"A book with lots of twists and turns. Definitely a good read, as I didn't want to put it down. Not for the faint at heart!! I am a fan of Erica Spindler!!!"
5,Fantastic Read,"Erica Spindler is an amazing author. Bone Cold is just another example of her fantastic writing and talent. If you have never read her books, start now - lots to choose from and be sure to read them all!!"
4,A Very Good Read!!!!!!!,"Every year when we go to the beach, I like to take a new book for the car ride and to sneak in any chance I get that I'm not running after my 2 small children. I wasn't able to get the book store but I remembered that some one had given me a box of books which are now located in my attic. I picked this book and another by another author. I chose to read this first...... I couldn't put it down and when i was finished with it I was soooooooo upset... I wish it wasn't over... I thought it was that GREAT. It was quite a thriller and I couldn't wait to see ""whodunit"".LOVED IT!!!!"
1,Disappointing Read!,"I agree with one of the other reviewers. If I read ""muttered an oath"" again I will drop dead. I had a hard time reading this book because it was so predictable and the dialogue was not very realistic. Actually, the whole story was not very realistic. I am a police officer and many of the police scenes were not convincing. Maybe that isn't fair to say having personal experience, but I figure most readers would feel the same way.I found the book to be boring and had to force myself to forge onward in order to finish it. I will try to read one of her other books before I pass final judgement on Spindler. It may just be I don't enjoy her style more than thinking she isn't a very good writer. Sorry Spindler, but I would not recommend this book."
2,15 times,"15 Times--that's how many times the phrase ""muttered an oath"" was used in this book. I should learn not to read Amazon reviews BEFORE I read a book--that called my attention to that phrase, and I couldn't get it out of my head. I think I basically finished the book just because I wanted to see how many times that phrase was used, and in answer to Out Of My Mind's question--it was 15 times! I agree with the editing--the author needs new editors! I too could see where she was going with this, and who the killer was, early on, but there were a few twists that I didn't see. All in all it was an ok book--a quick summer read, but nothing more serious than that."
5,On a par with James Patterson and Thomas Harris!,"I have been a fan of Erica Spindler's since her first mainstream book, RED, which I loved. Each book has gotten better and better, and BONE COLD was my reward for hanging in there with this awesome author. In this story Spindler tells of Anna North, who now lives in New Orleans after a horrific ordeal in her childhood. She thought she'd left all that behind...until a chain of grisly murders in the French Quarter--murders that are linked to what happened to Anna so long ago.I literally could not put this book down until I had finished it. I read it straight through in one sitting, from just after breakfast till after dinner time. If you have never read Erica Spindler, you're in for a real treat. She has an amazing ability to tell a complicated, riveting story and never lets you down. It's no wonder she's a bestselling writer. Thanks, Erica, for hours and hours of wonderful entertainment."
3,Bored me at first,"I fell in love with their infectious second album, ""The Glands,"" and then I looked for this one. My mood improved after I removed 5 monotonous tracks from this playlist. I'm starting to like it. Three-and-a-third stars."
4,power,i wrote this review last month already. i got it quick. but it only lasts for 3 and half hours but im happy
5,"You've Got Diabetes....now, what can you eat???","Diabetic Cooking provides great recipes and meal ideas geared to those with diabetes; either type 1, type 2, or even anyone who wants to eat well and feel great.There's a wide-variety of recipe ideas, from soup to nuts, main courses to desserts. I keep all of mine with my cookbooks and use them all the time! Delicious and diabetes can happen! Yum!"
4,Diabetic Recipes,Good little magazine with great recipes. Great guide for sodium and fat intake as well.
1,This is an awful book,"The Megrimum is an imaginary creature at the top of a volcano. A young boy visiting the town of Instep, wanted to find out what was really at the top of the mountain. He found out with a trusty pal. At first Egan (the young boy) didn't want to tell anyone what he had seen, but eventually he had to. I think this is an awful book because this book is to predictable."
3,Is the migrum really real?,This book is not a really great book it has a lot of moral but the story needs more structure. I did this book for a book project and it is one of the most neutralized books I have read it includes some major points that are good and bad.
3,Kind of weird,"My daughter is in a book club and this was one of the books they read. It's odd. I'm not sure I think it's worth the read or not. It's super easy and fast (she's 9), but I didn't find it too interesting personally."
4,Great for parties!,It was exactly what I was looking for. The disco ball was a hit at my daughter's disco themed birthday party.
3,cute....sends out light but eats batteries!,"This does work well in a kids wroom,,,,but the major problem we have found is it eats batteries so my advise would be to invest in re-charageable batteries and keep a set charged.ALSO...don't get in too much of a hurry to buy here. B&M; stores such as TARGET and KOHLS now have thie ""cool college room stuff"" as much as 80% off......I bought a similar one to this (base was black instead of orange) and paid $2.40 for it last week. Just an FYI"
1,Did Not Fit,They said it would fit my sons truck but it did not. So be careful to trust it when it says it is compatable with your vehicle.
1,WRONG PART,V.Holt was right the first time. I have a 1970's dodge van. I thought it would fit because there server said that it would. Mr Gasket #6923 is NOT 36inches long. The 6923 was made for sedans. Wrong part doesn't fit waste of time.
4,Murder Mystery and Mischief!,"Paula Gosling has written a novel that, although it is slow starting out, becomes more interesting as a web of conspiracy, greed and deception are spun. On a small island, where simplicity of life is maintained by its long term residents, the unthinkable happens. When a distraught woman's malicious husband turns up dead, she becomes the prime suspect. Has she finally had enough of his disturbing manipulations or is someone out to frame her? Find out for yourself in ""The Body in Blackwater Bay.""-Tenaya Jacob, author of ""Seasonings of the Soul."""
2,Map falls apart after 3 days,I did not expect much from the book and wasn't disappointed. It is very superficial but gives a relatively acceptable pointers on where to go and what to do. I got it for the map. The content of the map is good but paper quality horrible. It literally disintegrated after first few days. It still was very helpful but a bit better paper would not hurt.
3,Simple science experiments to add to your collection.,"Looking for simple experiments which are always successful? Janice VanCleave's books provide just that approach. And 201 Awesome, Magical, Bizarre and Incredible Experiments adds to her large collection of published experiments. The title is misleading as the experiments are not very unusual. But the experiments are simple and most use readily-available materials. Good scientific explanations accompany each experiment. The book would benefit by some emphasis on the inquiry-approach to science and encouraging (rather than discouraging) changing variables during the experiments...The Science Spiders(TM) Newsletter."
5,Easy science experiments for children,"My homeschool group uses this science experiments book, and we love it. The experiments are simple, don't require a lot of materials (many you already have at home), and children love them. I have recommended this book to other homeschooling parents who were concerned about not being able to do science experiments because these are so parent/child friendly."
3,Not a strong science book,"I bought this book because I'm a Classical Conversations tutor. Some of the demonstrations are fun, but don't buy this book if you're looking for true science experiments."
4,"This is still one of my favorite shows, but the final season so far lacks the zest of the previous six seasons.","Still good, but losing steam. They're tying up story lines which probably explains the lack of laughs for me. lt's still one of my favorite shows, and I will miss it."
5,love love love love,there is nothing about 30 rock that i don't love. puts a smile on my face. wish it wasn't ending.
5,30 rock,I've watched all six seasons but only two episodes of season 7 so far so good. Favorite character overall would be Tina Fey's character
3,disappointed with season 7,"Unfortunately, Season 7 didn't retain the magic. I'm a huge 30 Rock fan. I'm impressed they did such amazing productions for so long!"
2,Only clicked the Q&A with Tina Fey,"Meh. I'm a big Tina Fey fan, but it was so-so. I loved the series, but the free interviews are worth the price"
4,An amazing account of the government's drug coverups.,"Celerino Castillo III spent 12 years in the DEA raiding cocaine labs in South America, training anti-narcotics units, and investing drug rings. His account shocks and amazes. I have met Mr. Castillo, and he as he humbly recounts his stories, it astounds me what the government is really up to. This is a four star winner."
1,"Great story, but...","Castillo tells a great story, even if there isn't much truth to it. Yes, all guerilla groups inevitably get involved with drugs. That's about where the truth ends. John Kerry's investigation went nowhere because there was no evidence, and he admitted that. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept. also came up empty. So naturally it MUST be a dark conspiracy! Please. The contra leaders were adamant that their subordinates NOT raise money via illegal means. Besides, if the Contras HAD all of that drug money, they wouldn't have needed so much US funding. The cartels ended their association with contra armies by 1982. Bottom line: Castillo's book is not about drugs; it's a shameful attempt to rewrite history in favor of America's red enemies."
5,The best electonic music CD I've heard in a while.,"First off- do not pigeonhole this CD as a drum & bass record, as it is so much broader than that. This is an album that fans of quality deep house (Mark Farina mix CDs), dubby organic downtempo (a la Kruder & Dorfmeister, Thievery Corp), OR drum & bass will appreciate immensely. Yes, the tracks have a lighter touch with some diva vocals, melody, latin persussion, but they never leave out the rock solid rolling basslines. One track is called ""Perfect Combination"", and that's what this CD is: a perfect combination of the smooth & ruff, light and dark. Plus it's two discs for the pirce of one."
4,"Compelling, Compassionate Claire is on Another Case","Librarian and rare book expert Claire Reynier is back again. In this one a young homeless woman named Maia body is found dead in the library with a page taken out from a valuable book. Maia apparently died of a heroin overdose, but Claire believes there is more to it.She researches the illustration from that rare book that had been found with Maia's body. This leads her to artist Edward Girard who may or may not have been Claire's father, and then on to Taos where she finds that Maia had indeed been sexually abused and this reminds her of when she was almost abused as a child. She'd always felt bad about not turning in her potential abuser, but he was a friend of the family, as is so often the case. Now Claire is on the trail of another abuser and this time she's not going to give up.Judith Van Gieson has an excellent character in Claire Reynier. She is compelling, compassionate, smart and believable."
2,"OK, not Great","This is a rather amateur sounding book. I read it through because I had started it, but I will not read other books by this author. In many cases the narrative was redundant. It was slow paced and predictable."
5,The Awful Truth!,This is a very sweet Cary Grant and Irene Dunne comedy. A couple with differences decide to divorce but can't seem to get it through their heads that their marriage will be ending. Lots of fun.
1,a non-paid political statement,"I had to respond to the previous review. I think this is the perfect place to point out the greed of the movie studios. Why else would they release a box set where 4 of the 5 titles were previous available? Also, see the new Mel Brooks box set. You will have to buy that just to get titles such as ""High Anxiety"" and ""Silent Movie"". How about the deluxe Scarface edition from a few years ago, that was the only way to get the original Scarface (1932) on DVD. There are many more examples. Don't get me started on the habit or releasing special editions only months after the first edition came out. Enough is enough!I don't agree that we have to rate the movies (of course they are 5 star films), I can go to Maltin, or elsewhere, for reviews. What's nice about this forum is we can get peer assessments of DVD content, extra features, transfer quality, audio quality, etc. That's useful.... P.S. it's Matthew McConaughey"
1,Sony greed-merchants can kiss my you-know-what,"A quick scan of my DVD collection shows I'm a Cary Grant nut. Signature Collection. The Topper twofer. And on and on. Most purchased day-of-release or advance. Also on the shelf are Sony's releases of Only Angels Have Wings, The Talk of the Town, His Girl Friday and The Awful Truth. So tell me where is the single release of Holiday? I'm not about to spend another $35 when Sony's already gotten far more than that out of me for the 4 individual titles."
1,Greed!!!!!!!!,Someone should find a contact email address for SONY so people can complain that HOLIDAY is not coming out [yet] on DVD for the US. What are they thinking????
1,Great Movie. Lousy DVD.,"This is one of the best screwball comedies, but Columbia has released an awful print of the film. There are even frames missing from the DVD. Not only does Columbia overcharge for their products, but they release hideous looking prints. The VHS video is better quality than this DVD."
3,Disappointed DVD viewer,"My favorite scene in the movie is when the characters are at the night club where Dixie Bell preforms ""My Dreams are Gone With the Wind"". Prior to the song Jerry invites himself and Dixie Bell to sit down with Lucy and Daniel. First Lucy and Jerry looks at each other, then at Dixie Bell, then at each other, then at Daniel, then at each other again. It's pretty funny. Unfortunately, the portion of the scene where they look at Dixie Bell has been removed from the DVD. Why would a DVD of a movie not have all the scenes of the original film? I was disappointed and will stick with watching the movie on tape."
5,Comical look at the way stubborness mixes up marriage,"This is a superb classic. It takes a lighthearted look at the way stubbornness and misunderstandings can mix up a marriage. Cary Grant and Irene Dunne are headed for divorce. And the dog, Mr. Smith, (aka Asta in the Thin Man movies) is darling. There are many funny incidents as each tries to move on and see others. One of the best movies I've seen all year!!!"
4,GOOD FOR THE TIME PERIOD! GRANT IS GREAT AS USUAL!,"I have been watching a lot of Cary Grant films for the first time and I have been slightly disappointed with some of them. 'The Awful Truth' is another critically acclaimed film that doesn't quite live up to it's reputation. I found the first half rather boring, but it does redeem itself in the second half. In my opinion, it is Grant and Irene Dunne that make this one work. I guess when you think about the competition from it's time period, it does stand out. The DVD transfer on the box set which I viewed this film from has a very good transfer and a few interesting extras."
5,The Awful Truth,"The Awful Truth has got to be one of the funniest movies ever made. The main stars in this 1937 hit comedy are Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, two actors who never got the recognition that they deserved in the Hollywood awards department. I have watched this movie at least 75 times and laugh until I cry everytime. The casting in this movie is perfect, the timing is perfect, the style and the class. This is a ""must see"" for all ages. I wish they still made movies like this one."
5,Pretty much perfection,"This is one of the most exhilarating comedies ever made.Good judgement informs every frame.Grant is sublime(this is the movie in which Cary Grant first relaxed,began to play and came to relish being ""Cary Grant""),Dunne is subtle,sly and witty,Bellamy is far cleverer a performer than he appears and Asta is a veritable Chaplin of the dog world.A suitably stylishly-packaged,lovingly re-mastered DVD version cannot - surely - be far away,but,until it actually arrives,watch this video and see just how joyous Hollywood comedy can be."
5,A Classic Hollywood Screwball Comedy,"I laughed every single minute of the movie. Irene Dunne and Cary Grant obtain a divorce decree and they fight for the affections of their dog, Asta. They each end up sabotaging the other person's relationship with someone else and eventually they both realize, THE AWFUL TRUTH is, still love each other."
1,Poor Recording,Very grainy picture. Not what I expected at all. Expected quality comparable to when viewed on Cable network. Will investigate sources more from now on.
4,Classic Films with the most suave of Hollywood stars...,"This box set has some of the best know Cary Grant films... directed by some of the best directors of that era. You can't go wrong with any of the 5 choices in this box set. If you like drama, slapstick, romantic comedy... you probably already like Cary Grant then...and this box set won't disappoint."
2,Major Dissapointment,"When I watched The Awful Truth last night for the first time, my expectations were at their highest. I had just brought My Man Godfrey (Carole Lombard is a genius) and Bringing Up, Baby (although Cary Grant is priceless, Katherine Hepburn is hideously miscast). The Awful Truth may have been a sensational hit back in l937 but it bored the heck out of me. Grant was incredible, as usual. Irene Dunne was a revelation. I loved both their personalities. It was the old, worn-out story that made me yawn. Back then, it was probably cool and hot. But, wow, was I glad when it ended and I could watch Bringing Up Baby again, trying to pretend that it wasn't Katherine Hepburn trying to act scatterbrained and idiotic. I kept seeing my favorite B-gal, Glenda Farrell in Katherine's role. Or better still, Carole Lombard. She could do anything."
3,Ya get Deppression Glass with this one!,"It's amazing how quickly Cary Grant with Mae West's help took over as the Hollywood suave-comic star. He's just oozing with charm and is cast nicely as a rich guy playing around on his virtuous wife.Enter a new suitor, Ralph Bellamy. He's always the convenient also ran, a Texas Oil yokel with a smothering mother in tow. It's pretty predictable and the Depression audiences slum and laugh with the well-to-do for 90 minutes."
1,Holiday on a single disk,I have also already purchased all of the other disks in the set. I am agravated that sony would be so short-sighted and not realize that many classic movie fans will have already done this also. Please e-mail Sony and advise them of your dissatisfaction with this release.
5,The Best Cary Grant Set Ever!,"Four Cary Grant classics plus one not in the same league but interesting (""The Talk of the Town"") make this set the one to have. Put it alongside your ""Gunga Din,"" ""The Philadelphiea Story,""Operation Petticoat,"" ""To Catch a Thief,"" ""Notorious,"" ""My Favorite Wife"" and ""North by Northwest"" DVDs and congratulate yourself on your impeccable taste."
5,Best Screwball comedy,Don't listen to that malcontent from Russia. This is one of the best screwball comedies ever made. Grant and Dunne are perfection.
2,"Did nothing for me,,,","Definitely not my favorite Cary film. Perhaps this movie was a hoot for its time, but it's a complete bore now. Where there are a couple of times I chuckled, the rest of the time, however, I kept wondering when the film was going to end. If you're a Cary fan, then this something you must see to judge for yourself and/or to just say that you saw it. Other than that, there are better films to occupy your time."
4,Solid Sermon from Rev Daniels,Another fine sermon from Rev. Leo Daniels. The entertainer in him really comes out in this sermon.
5,Great game (once you've turned off the points/cards),"Reviewers have already talked about the points/cards issue, so I won't say much more about them. Personally, they annoy the hell out of me so I turn them off.The game itself is incredible. The game play is great, since you can adjust your and the CPU's abilities to assure competitive gameplay (who really wants to win every game 10-0? Or lose every game 1-0?).The graphics are great, the sounds are great too. The announcers are hilarious. The defensive AI still needs fine-tuning, but it's not terrible. The goalies make up for defensive lapses most times.This is the best hockey game I've ever played. The best thing (besides the game play itself) is its ability to be customized to your talent level and your preferences (be it about penalties, collecting cards, etc.) If you're a hockey fan, it's definitely worth the bucks."
2,Not good...,"This is just a quick initial review... Save your money if you are looking at buying the PC version.I bought the PC version of this game which is usually far superior to the Playstation versions... The game looks like it has potential but the graphics are skippy and the gameplay is hard to control. I have all the recommended hardware to run this game but I guess it is not enough because it isn't very much fun to play...Hopefully the Playstation II verstion will be better, stay clear of the PC version."
2,WARNING,"This game does not work on all systems. I was lucky to buy it at a store that let me return the package opened.I have a Windows 2000 system, which this game is supposed to support. And I am a computer guy. I tried EVERYTHING to get this game working, and still still still it froze up before I ever got to play a game. What a shame! I tried updating all drivers, updating directX... deleting registry entries, EVERYTHING! Be careful with this one..."
1,Garbage,"This pool was used in my house as a ball pit for 3 days for a 10 month old. The top pink ring is leaking air around the seam somewhere. I have filled it 3 times in 3 days. The rocket scientist at Amazon who replied to my email about this issue thinks I should go out and buy a box at my own expense, deflate this heap of junk, and drive 10 miles to the nearest post office to get a $15 refund. This is after the $8 or so shipping that they would be paying for. Congrats Amazon you just pissed off a longtime customer over $7.00Overall, this pool is a cheap plastic similar to a dollar store beach ball, and came with no repair kit. Save your money."
4,nice pool,Good size for a couple of toddlers - my 2 year old can climb in and out of it on her own... the sides are high enough that you can get a good amount of water in it. I like that each of the rings inflates individually so if one gets a hole it's an easier repair. Floor is very hard to inflate - doesn't provide much cushion at all.
2,not very durable.,We only had this pool set up in the yard for 3 days and one of the rings got a hole in it. For the price I guess you can't expect it to last forever but I did expect it to last longer than that. The plastic is very thin not hard for something to go through it.
1,Don't buy this poor swimmning pool!!!,"I bought this item two month ago, and I was using for indoor activity. Usually, I put my one year old son inside and let him play with toys. However, I only used for one week, one of the rings has been broken, then the second ring....anyway, just don't buy this item...very poor material, easy leak. Don't waste your money, get something else."
2,Doesn't hold air,"Pool has three rings to blow up plus the bottom, kind of a pain. The top ring held air for the first day and now won't hold air at all and we haven't been able to locate whear the leak is. Pool is also really small. Once inflated, does not measure to the size listed. Perhaps the size listed is the exterior walls, not interior making it kind of small even for a 3 year old.Good thing it was inexpensive, I will be replacing with something different."
3,Basic kidy pool,"Water proof, doesn't leak, holds the air and is cheap. Not much else needed so it works. Easy to blow up."
5,revise my opinion,I've used the second half of the book extensively. Previously I wrote the first-half wasnt that good. Thats not correct - the first half of the book is a great introduction to web development for newbies. This is a great book to teach you HOW to DESIGN a dynamic web application.
3,half lousy half good,"The first half of this book isn't so good. Its a true beginners survey of web technologies and how to do a project. But like most books that want to provide a sweeping overview of all web technologies, it doesn't really explain it very well.I give the book three stars because of the second half of the book - with the WAE - and the focus on using UML in web apps. The second half of the book is quite good.This book tries to be all things for all people - books like that are usually only found collecting dust as a decoration on a project managers shelve who wants to show the world he/she really understands this UNL [sic]. Just my 2 cents."
2,Not for UML professionals (not enough meat),"This book is not bad as books go. It is a good introduction for beginners but if you want to write real Web applications you will have to look somewhere else (at least this is what I would have to do) My main criticisms and suggestions for improvement are:1) better explanation of boundary, entity and control objects 2) nowhere is there a mention of statecharts (essential for this kind of application area?) 3) Using packages to suggest that they are the same as architecture is not 100% kosher in my opinion (see page 108) 4) There are other ways to define a logical model for applications than the usual layered model (see again pages 107-108). For example, the SELECT method uses service-based models that are more robust an closure to the real business model. The layers model will be difficult to scale and I am not sure if it is really robust as suggested in the book's cover.As a buyer, I got carried away by the words 'Web' and 'UML' in the book's title."
2,Too much padding,"I bought this book looking for a common language for describing web project requirements and design that we could use for project specification and working with partners. I am an experienced Web Project Manager with a lite experience of UML in the past.The book assumes UML knowledge, but the first 150 pages are dedicated to explaining web technology to the reader. Not quite ""The Internet for Dummies"", but hardly critical content?When eventually the author gets into the meat of the Web Extension for UML, it's interesting, but he still spends a lot of time talking about thick-client applications, which really are the exception on public websites. There is one pretty extensive example based on ASP, complete with code. The WAE is useful, but of 300 pages, I found only about 50 useful. A lot of it has already been publisher by the Author on his own website."
5,Excellent book,"You may want to skip the first 80 or so pages of this book if you are already a seasoned web programmer. This section is an introduction to web based programming.The rest of the book is a very informative, practical guide to the use of UML within a web based project. I also found the book to expand upon and clarify the ideas from 'The Unified Software Development Process' book."
5,Star wars saga continues.,My grandson likes everything star wars and everything LEGO so this fits the bill. Not sure sometimes if I am buying these for my grandson or my son. My son still has his old LEGOs and some of them are still put together just like he did them yesterday...when in fact they are 20 to 25 years old. All of my favorite toys were metal cars and trucks and they are long since rusted away.
5,Durable fun!,"Though I had to build it for my 5yr old, the model is nice and sturdy with a hinged canopy in two places, a tiny cargo container inside, as well as tilting guns on the side. And, of course, it looks so much like the A-wing in the movies. He loves it!"
5,I love when you get what you THINK your getting,"I ordered these skate covers not knowing for sure what I needed and with the hope of getting them before Christmas. Based on the description and the information listed I felt pretty reassured and placed my order with the normal ""hoping for the best"". I was very pleased when they were exactly what I wanted. They are thicker than I thought they would be because I was worried about cutting through them with the blades. They shipped fast and arrived in time to be included as the stocking stuffer I had planned. I will (and have already) recommend Amazon's sport store to the other sports moms I know."
1,ATTENTION ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING THIS GAME!!,5 of my friends and myself have bought this game...it only works for 1 of them!!!THis game constantly crashes for my friend that it works for!WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!
1,Great Idea....Poor game,I bought this game a few months ago and i was hopping for a great game but when i installed it it would want to connect to the internet ( because i have a 56k) but i was playing Single Player and i couldn't even get the Multiplayer to work at all.
1,don't waste your money,This game is to hard in spot's. You just get killed right away. What fun is that? Also there's flaws in the graphics. I have a dell 1600 mgh with a 124 game card and it still won't play right. Stick with return to castle wolfenstein. That's a five star game. I also have the expansion pack it's as bad as the first one.
2,Ending a major dissapointment,"The game has some interesting missions nad features, but the final mission is nearly impossible to beat. I have read several walkthroughs and reviews and they all say the same. It is only by sheer luck that the final mission can be finished. It consists of planting bombs in a building and escaping before it blows up. Unfortunately, by the time you make it to the door, too many enemies are there to kill you. If you stop to shoot them ,you die in the building explosions, if you run outside, the enemies simmply shoot you full of holes before you can board the train. ther were also several problems with freezeups and installation, overall a major disappointment in gaming"
1,Don't buy iy until they fix it!,"The game is great if you can get it to work. The success rate for that is horrific. It does not seem to mater what your system is based on - AMD, Intel, VIA, etc. Your chances are about 50/50. Six other folks I work with have purchased this game. Only 2 got it to work right out of the box. Two others got it to work with a lot of sweat and tears and then to find it fail later in the game (audio looping problems). The remainder gave up and returned the game. I wish I would have done the same.Support for this game is slow in comming. EA hast left it to you to debug their software and find work arounds for the numerous problems. I advise two things:1. log on to the MOHAA site and check out the user forums. It will give you a good idea of what you may face.2. Don't purchase this game until EA comes out with a major patch to resolve the problem.Good luck."
5,this game has honor!,"As soon as the game began, I was totally into it. The sound of the guns are exactly how they sound in real life and the missions are extremely fun to play(especially the D-Day mission). The graphics are astounding. The music and the sound make this game the top game of the year. The creators of this game of outdone themselves and they need to make another one, and fast! This is a game worth buying and it's not a waste of money. Trust me!"
4,A masterpiece of it's time!,"I purchased this game a week ago and have really only had a couple of opportunities to play it. I have seen enough, however, to say with confidence that this is one of the best games I've ever had the good fortune of playing. Incredible graphics and outstanding audio effects. The soundtrack is awesome.My only complaint is that targeting in this game stinks. Its incredibly difficult to hit intended targets because the placement and angle of the gun. There appears to be no crosshair function (or other targeting mechanism) for any weapon except the sniper rifle, so you really don't know where you're aiming. This takes away from the enjoyment of the game and proves to be extremely frustrating when you're in the heat of battle.This is not enough to keep me from playing the game (it's still that fun), but it is enough to prevent me from giving it 5 stars."
5,Best Multiplayer Game Ive Played in a Long Time,"This has to be the most thrilling, exciting and action packed game I have ever played. If you are thinking of buying this game, PLEASE I ADVISE YOU TO BUY IT!!! Not only are the graphics great but the gameplay is simply incredible. I am so hooked on this game right now I keep thinking im gonna get sniped while im walking down the street. IM PARANOID! lol, anyway this is a definite buy!"
5,A multiplayer breakthru,This game is fine in single player but rules all mutiplayer first persons on the net. feel the joy as you plow your way thru hords of nazis and laugh at the anguish the person is feeling 400 miles away and laugh some more (this is based on my expertese no guarenties)
5,one word: AWESOME!!!!,"From the Beach, to the trenches. MOHAA is a great game, I play it dayly and I love every moment of the game... Awesome story line, and great graphics. I also love the music, every intense moment has intense music with it as well... this game contains no bugs I am aware of. EA does a great job with the Detail and Accuracy of WW2: the Greatest war of all wars. I'm 17 years old, and I have been in love with ww2 since I first studied about it in 3rd grade. I'm also writing a WWII novel, based on this hit game. If you loved Saving Private Ryan, and you wanted to know what it was like to be on the beach? then buy this game... you wlll not be dissappointed."
5,Medal of Honor: Allied Assault,"I really like this game. Lots of action, shooting and getting shot. Overall, great graphics and game play. I recommend this game to anyone who likes shooter, first person shooters and military games. My rating 5 stars and a thumbs up."
4,Medal of Honor,"Very task oriented game, graphics are a little grainy and stiff.Overall I like it almost as much as COD."
2,Too Linear,"The games graphics are okay, though I don't usually like this graphics engine, it seems jerky to me, and I know I have the system requirements to handle. I think it handles physics poorly, it seems like you go from running to standing in one frame of video. Too much of this gives me video whiplash.The game play is tough, but it's straight linear action, and I found that dumb. When pinned down you can't move to flank, you can only crawl forward, so you wind up saving a lot. Plus enemies you can't see are nailing you, and some of that should go both ways. I can't see them, they can't see me.It's basically like battling your way down a hallway. I think the best games in the war genre are battlefield 1942 (worse graphics but cool teamplay especially online) and ghost recon.If ubisoft would make a world war two expansion pack or full version game off the ghost recon engine, it would smoke this weak effort from EA."
4,Absolutely Incredible,"Medal Of Honor is probably one of the most detailed World War 2 games there is. As a shoot 'em up fan i can say that this game is the best on the market right now. Last year's Return To Castle Wolfenstein was not quite as detailed as Medal Of Honor in weaponry, levels, and graphics. The AI is'nt really taken care of, enemies suddenly come out of rooms where you had already killed everyone, or one moment you're still, then you take a step forward and you're shot at by a group of people that came out of nowhere. In close-combat the enemies are good, they lie down to get a better shot and dodge bullets. If you get too close they'll hit you with they're guns, they throw back grenades, and are very stealthy. Some even hide in closets! The levels are vast and explorable, which is important. Well, my advice is buy it!"
3,Medal of Honor Does Not Always Live Up to The Hype,"I was so excited at the prospect of playing Medal of Honor: Allied Assault that I put out the money for this overpriced game. I felt like I was playing the HBO mini-series Band of Brothers or the movie Saving Private Ryan. This made the game a rerun right out of the gate for me. However, there are some aspects of this first person shooter that make it worth your time. First, it is HARD to play. This is the first game that has challenged this veteran gamer in a long time. Those Germans are nasty! Second, the missions offer variety and are innovative. You switch from working with a team to following a spy to, well...I don't want to give it all away. If you are new to this genre, you will not feel as ""seen it, done that"" as I was."
2,BEWARE!,"What a nightmare.This game is not for those who just want to load and play! The game will crash on you and EA must know theres a problem because they even have a ""safe"" mode to use if you crashed once when signing on.I managed to get through basic training only to have the thing crash again when I went to start the first mission.I have a Pentium 3 Gateway with beefed up ram (custom added for gaming) and still have system crashes with this game,which has never happened before. The game looks very promising but I urge those of you who are undecided to wait until EA gets the bugs out of this nightmare before purchasing it."
3,Will AI ever be accurate...,"EA has outdone themselves again. This game has all the eye candy AND ear candy you could ever dream of, but just like most games of this type the AI for the enemy is superb and the AI for your team is, how should I put this, ineffective, impotent, etc. The enemy AI is full of soldiers that are crack shots under any circumstances but then again they should be when your team members stand in the open looking at you...ho hum I'll still get the game and will thoroughy enjoy playing it."
2,just to give advice to cyrus,yes cyrus is right this game is nothing copared to call of duty wich if you have never played it is awsome you can play as a GI of as axis or as rushins or as british dang right. who cares about this game go and buy call of duty if you whant to have in WW2
3,Good if u have the pc,"This is a great game but it rarely would load without performing an ""illegal operation"" each time it did that i would have to shut my computer down. Otherwise when it did it was a terrific game the graphics were good weapon choice was good overall i would rate this game a 5 out of 5 but it kept performing that ""illegal operation"" Only get this game if u have a good pc"
1,Never seen a game crash this often,"A fun game to play, but this game has so many bugs that makes it almost impossible to play. It can bring down Win 2000 server with no problem. Do a search on the game's name and ""crash"" to see what I am talking about. I've played many games, but this one is the one with biggest number of problems that I have ever seen."
5,As real as it gets in the digital ether,"My system: AMD Athlon 1700+, Abit KR7A-133, 512MB DDR 2100, GeForce 3 with 64MB DDR.Superb play with the system described above. The Quake III engine performs flawlessly in 1024X768 / 32-bit. The scenarios are very real with some historical perspective included. The landing at OMAHA beach is taken right out of Saving Private Ryan. It sends chills down your back after you realize you've quick loaded 20 times just to get to the beach head. I recommend playing at the medium level until you get a feel for the game.Overall game play is fantastic and requires some accurate shooting in many of the scenarios."
3,Medal Of Honor,"This game had a pretty good story line and decent gameplay. The graphics are fine and so is the music.What really annoyed me about this game is that when someone sounded an alarm in a few of the missions, the game kept flooding you with guys until you turned off the alarm, (the reason I gave it 3 stars, not 4) but otherwise this game is great."
4,Awesome,"I played this game as a kid and i absolutely fell in love with it, and i couldn't find it in over 10 years, now that i have it, i can't stop playing it, this game is historical and i love it"
2,Fun single player...,"To a point. Get tired of waltzing through town blasting germans after a while. If you're going for realism, I say go all out and get Ghost Recon. If you're going for muchos kills, I'd go get Quake 3. And if I wanted a multiplayer game, those two and Counterstrike still have this blown out of the water. Oh yeah, and Wolfinstein too, eh? So take my advice and don't waste your money on this one. Remember, Jedi Knight II comes out pretty soon. yeah baby yeah!"
5,great game,what is this about the game being too hard. you must be horrible at video games because i beat it without a ton of trouble. there is an awesome level where you actually get to drive a tank. this game is very realistic. a must have for any computer gamer. graphics and gameplay are amazing
4,Great Game!,This is a good game. Lots of action and in a war enviroment. There are some missions were you need to sneak around. Sometimes this game really makes me pised off. Overall this is a good game.
5,Raging Combat Action,"Allied assault delivers! First person action, causing one to think on his or her toes! As an Army Sergeant, I highly recommend this action game! I enjoy the realism of the period weapons and the fact that your team can and often does get injured or killed off. Often, the missions are no easy task. You learn as you go along. You must think tactically to achieve the goals. You will realize this when at first you see how difficult it is to get of that damned beach! Once you do make it, you know you have acheived something. This is in no way as difficult as actual combat, but it feels pretty genuine once the bullets start to fly in your direction. You have received your orders! Defeat the Germans at all costs!"
5,GREAT GAME,"This was one of the greatest games that I have ever played. The realism is incredible. After playing this game to the end, I watched Band of Brothers... I could not believe how historically accurate this game was. I highly recommend it to everyone."
4,Great Game--for high-end systems only.,"Just a word of warning to those who have systems over a few years old. I have a Dell 550Mhz, 384meg ram, 32meg video card (Nvidia TNT2). It's a fairly standard high-end system as of a few years ago yet even on all the lowest game settings Allied assault is nearly unplayable. And no, it's not a gummed up system--it ran Return to Wolfenstein just fine. Think twice if you have an older system because EA has left you in the dust with this one."
2,"yawn,am i a mouse","This is the first game in many years that was a total let down to me.The scripted events are foolish.You can't change the fate of any of your soldiers.The maze is old.Gimmie some freedom of choice and movement.If I shoot a guy at pointblank with a .50 cal in the face he is goig to die instantly;not in this ""game.""There are the same things from 1 and 2 rehashed again and again.2 or 3 good levels not total missions.People who like this game are most likely looking for arcade style acti.........zzzzzzzz.To be fair,when this game came out i was playing operation flashpoint.A real military style game,where you use tactics and command choices.A total waste of my money.The younger kids might like it,but I find it insulting to our intelligence."
4,Nice!,"When I first reviewed this game, I based everying on the multiplayer demo. I had a shakey experience but that wasn't the game's fault, it was the server I was connected to.I just downloaded the singer player demo and I am impressed. Very rich war like experience and the graphics are amazing. I am a big Quake 3 and recent Return to Castle Wolfenstein fan. This game is more along the lines of PG-13 which is just fine. This game is designed to be a war like experience. A huge improvement over the previous installments on Playstation.Great job EA!"
3,I had a little fun playing this title,"I thought this game had great sound, and gameplay. Though the AI, Multiplayer, and length all come very short. First of all the multiplayer is stupid as hell. 4 game modes is a joke. And the AI is simply put as crap. If I where to simply choose between Call of Duty and Medal of Honor: Allied Asault i would have to go with CoD."
2,Good Luck getting it to work on your computer.,I have a brand new computer and this game did nothing but crash so needless to say I never played it and will be selling mine.
2,Feels like Redneck Rampage,This game is too programed for me. This game is ment for 16 year olds not adults. There is none of the problem solving involved in Operation Flashpoint. Boring!
4,Lacking a few elements,"First of all, the game is fun to play. It's fairly exciting and the array of environments cant be beat. Like others have said this game is comparable to RTC Wolfenstein, except with worse graphics. The biggest problem with the game is they try to make it as realistic as possible, but forgot that when a granade goes off between your legs, a body becomes ""bodies"". There is no blood, and a wounded person is only wounded for a few seconds. The editorial review pretty much says it all. If you want a more realistic feel go with Operation: Flashpoint, if you want a little more sci-fi and better graphics go with RTCWolfenstein. Overall this game is worth the money, but only if you have the ones i've already mentioned."
4,Great 1st Person Shooter... Lacking in Multiplayer,"It has been known since the game came out on the market that an upgrade patch is needed for the multiplayer. This game is immensely lag intensive. My neighbors and I have setup games over DSL and Cable connections, and always report that the game is jumpy, characters jump across the screen, or you find yourself running into a wall you just passed 10 seconds ago. And this is with a max of 90ms ping time.As well, with almost any game that comes out, there are a few who find ways to cheat. I bought the game the day it hit the shelf, and by the time I had gotten home, finished the Africa campaign and gotten online... some bozo was running around in invisible mode shooting everyone. Where is the fun and skill in that?The Single player missions are awesome, but if you're looking for an online medium, you may find MOHAA lacking"
1,Won't run more than 5 minutes on recommended hardware,"This would be a five star review if only the program would run for more than 5 minutes. I'm running on a 1GHz P3, 256M RAM, ATI Rage 128. The demo runs fine but the full program doesn't like the video card because it keeps causing it to send an invalid signal and I have to reboot. I have the latest drivers. I don't have this problem with any other games.If you have the same video card as me, I don't recommend this game."
2,Just another shot 'em up,"I give 5 stars for graphics, 3 for sound and none for realizm. No one person could possiblly do alone these missions as the game unfolds. It starts out good as you are a member of a fire team and all are working together, but then after that it's you against the entire German Army. This game was not what I expected after reading all the reviews and above. Kind of reminds me of the game DOOM."
4,Unfortunately the same...,"I've been a big fan of the MOH series on the Playstation one, and have enjoyed the gameplay with the understanding of the limitations of the system's graphics and intuitive gameplay. I was all excited to try out the MOH-All.....While it is comparable to the Playstation one, it's biggest drawback has to be that it is only comparable to the Playstation one. This game seriously sells itself short in the graphics department and I haven't really gotten far enough to determine if all Nazi's are this stupid.Overall, it is a good game but it should be so much better."
4,GREAT WWII GAME; BEST EVER!!!,"If you like WWII and you like first person shooters, than this is the game for you. It is really great. Simmilar to Return to Castle Wolfenstein, but still with big differences. By far the best scene was the storming of Normandy. Right out of Saving Private Ryan. Really great. Very realistic. The only reason I give four stars instead of five is that the missions are a little boring, at least so far. It's mainly kill everyone and get to the end of the board. But I am only half way throught the game. Highly recomend!"
5,Best Game That I Have Ever Played!,"I Got Medal of honor when it came out, and i still play it ever day! The single player missins rock, and always are changleing(cann't spel). I just got a T1 modem, so i play the muti-player missions too. They rock X 10! I would totally recomend this game to anyone that loves WWII games, or just games in general."
4,You'll enjoy it.. but make sure your system is up to it!!,"Gameplay is very good, as you can gather from majority of reviews. Imagery and detail are stunning- if you are a WWII historian/buff AND a gamer...you've gone to heaven. Aside from all the obligatory gushing and kudos, what every potential buyer better be aware of is system demands. The requirements are high; I'm running an Athlon 1.2 with 256 MB, 32 MB onboard video and i was locking up constantly, even with all settings at min and background programs shut down. I used the experience as convenient excuse to upgrade- put in nVidia GeForce3 Ti200 64MB and ""voila"", things smoothed out. There's problems EA must be aware of, (see the 'safe' mode for crashes). I've never had problems running games (OP Flashpoint, RTCW, etc)and this game was a nightmare without the juiced up card (MY experience, now)....SO, if your system is up to the task, purchase and enjoy!!"
2,fun and challenging,I think Medal of honor was a great game. there was some bad things about the game thought like on Omaha beach the machine gunners know exsactley were you are! but with cheats it is a REALLY GREAT GAME!! One other thing is that you have to shoot the guys like 7 times unless you hit them in the head. i think that they should have more of a selection of weapons they have no hand to hand compat weapons(if you call hitting somebody with your pistol is) so it is hard there. you should also beable to man the big guns on boats and the 88's overall i think it is a good game and i recomend that you buy it.
5,BEST GAME EVER,If you have a high speed modem you will be playing this until the end of time. My only complaint would be a lack of multiplayer maps. But other than that this is a fun game.
5,Outstanding,My name is BigDave and I am a FPS fanantic. I have been hooked since Doom and usually try every one that comes out. The reason I mention this is so you know that when it comes to FPS I know of what I speak.I have to say with out a doubt this is the best FPS I have played. The graphics are really good and the weapons are cool and realistic. The story line and the animations are top notch. Where this game really shines is in it's sense of purpose. The missions are really exciting and you feel apart of the game.I do not lie when I say that I can give this game my highest recommendation. If you like PFS you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. There are some great ones out there like RTCW and AvsP2 but this one shines above them. Buy it and play the hell out of it!Dave
5,absoloutely amazing,"this game is amazing there is a huge variety of chalanging missions you will go on...the best part is D-Day I have played d-day alone 5 times in two days, it is so amazingly realistic,the best FPS game ive ever played!!!!!"
4,RPGs = Battles of Wit,"This book re-explained to me that RPGs are more a battle of wits between the game master and the players than anything else--it is what makes the games enjoyable and allows ALL players to share in the adventure of defining the world in their minds. Highly recommended to those former players who have forgotten how to play, yet want to share the excitement of making things up and winging it with their children and/or friends."
5,It's worth it!,"Blade, The corruptor, RushHour, and Spawn these 4 dvd run for 20 bucks a piece and for some smart person to throw all 4 of them in a box set for that price must of lost there job get it"
1,Better to Buy Seperately,"[Price]Rush Hour - Great Movie, very funny, highly recomendable...... [Price]The Corruptor - Good Movie, rather serious....... [Price]Blade - Decent Movie for action fans, rather gorry for the weak stomatch...... [Price]Spawn - Fair movie, good for those who like comic book remakes. Definitely not for kids. Very gory and a touch satanic.........."
4,Compelling,I love this book. I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't finished it yet. It's one of those books that you can read over and over and learn new material each time. Matt Ridley's writing style is very easy to follow and he makes the discoveries of science compelling. It's a well organized piece that will most likely intrigue your friends and family as it makes for great conversation. I'm planning on checking out his other published works as well. Great gift too!
5,Who Knew?,"I found this book uterly fascinating. For the lay person looking for a highly readable ""intro"" to genetics, I don't know of a better book. Who knew that; genes fight one another using chemical warfare, that the ""y"" chromosome that makes men men is largely unchanged for the last 70,000 years, that viruses rip-off RNA to enable them to invade our cells and wreak their havoc? And there's a lot more. Read it!"
4,recommended many times to friends,"one error, page 29, ""there is no bone in the chimpanzee body that I do not share."" yes there is, the baculum. both gorillas and chimps have one, human males do not.there are a few other problems introduced by the age of the book, a lifetime in genetics.but i've recommended the book many times to laymen friends who need to get some genetics understanding.both the organization and information are uniquely well done."
5,Genome--Good Introduction to Genetics,"As a social scientist, I am always searching for the link between nature and nurture. Matt Ridley's book Genome is a great peoce to the puzzle. The book describes the history and essence of human genes, as well as their functions on both a micro and macro level. Ridley successfully weaves his way through the jargon of hard science and cuts to the heart of the matter in simple, easy-to-read language. The book in an informative introduction to the functions of genomes and the history of the science that got us there. A fascinating book. A highly recommend it."
5,Excellent Book,"I read this book with only a moderate amount of background in Genetics. My interest is more like a hobbie so when I first started to read Matt Ridley's Genome I was afraid there would be alot I wouldn't understand. Thankfully, I was very wrong.The subject matter is very interesting and told in a helpful, nonacademic manner. I would recommend this book to everyone who has an interest in biology and genetics."
5,Wonderful work!,"This extensive book explores an unsurpassed variety of topics, all connecting to the blueprint of us all- DNA.I recommend this to anyone with an interest in genetics or biology, to those who need an update in what has been uncovered about our species in the past years, or for others like myself who are thirsty for a supplement to college biology.Matt Ridley has a certain humor about him- as demonstrated in his classification of the book as autobiography/biography which I found appropriate- which is persistent through the book along with his knack for deconstructing complex inner workings of his science."
3,Good book - interesting - lots of good stuff,"I struggled a bit with this book. The information presented is top notch and interesting but the prose never quite engaged me. I like, though, how the author skirts a textbook type of presentation of human genetics and opts for chapters that investigate the basis of particular traits. He investigates speciation, intelligence, instinct, and several other concepts. Probably the best general introduction to human genetics for the layperson with lots of interesting asides the student."
3,"Good, but has some non-fact facts. Flawed.","I got this thinking I'd get a nice airplane read out of it, maybe learn something. I've got a bioscience background.It's quite varied. I wish he had left out his entire discussion of human history for instance. The stuff about meat, metabolism and the brain in evolution, for instance, is rather ridiculous really, because there are so many millions of people who live their entire lives without meat. The factual arguments he gave for it are simply not true.Made me wonder what else he got wrong, and although parts are quite interesting, I found myself losing interest because I saw stuff that was misleading or untrue."
2,Professor unloads about basic concepts,This book may by now be sort of out of date but for folks like me who went to school before DNA was common knowledge it's a good read. My problem was with the author's analogies and metaphors. Clearly he's always preached to a captive audience. They are beyond quirky. He's English but that is no excuse. Any way the information about how genes work and mutate is good to know and here it is all in one place.
3,A mistake on the front page.,"This is an informative, interesting book for the layman. Indeed, it should be useful for many. However, there is an error on the first page that is propagated throughout the structure of the book. Indeed, there are 24 different human chromosomes. NOT 23. There are 23 pairs in the diploid human. But, there is a X and a Y. Thus, 24."
2,"Genome, by Ridley","This book is over-rated. The writing is not particulary lucid, and the grammar is often poor. Entirely too qualitative, as a rule."
4,review,great book...had to read it for a biology class and ended up not being able to put it down. It's interesting and easy to understand for all of us scientifically challenged
3,"Good science read, flawed by unnecessary political opining","Having read a number of books on this topic, I picked up this one while on vacation. I did enjoy the book overall and would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject. It is not a textbook of genetics by any reach, more of a layman's approach to what is a very complicated area of biology that does have some core ideas that even a non scienetist can grasp.It is a shame that the author cannot hold back his political opinions, which seem to just surface for no particular reason in various parts of this book. Albeit that the subject matter does tread on some delicate socio/political topics, that doesn't require him so so obviously vent his rather one sided subjective take on the matter at hand. It doesn't help that he offers little or no backing for his opinions, just his say so."
1,Always an exception...,"Sorry to be the voice of dissent here, but I didn't love it. Decently written, but a bit too simplified, even for the average reader. The major problem, though, is that it doesn't get to the POINT. This books plays up all the quirky little features of the genome--the gimmicks, the bells-and-whistles--but I feel it doesn't explain what the genome truly IS, its deepest meaning for our species and all of life on the planet. For that, try something like Dawkin's ""The Selfish Gene"" or Weiner's ""Time, Love, Memory."" Both are written for a lay audience but get a far better grasp on the real truth in the genome."
2,Nice story - emphasis on story,"Ridley is a good writer and it's a compelling read. However, his approach is far too similar to the approach taken by others who have a story to tell - and whose story trumps facts. And he is unabashed about this endeavor. He specifically states in the introduction that he took his ideas about human nature and then went looking for genes within each chromosome to support his story. Not exactly the ideal of the scientific method. But at least he's honest about it. Anyway, if you enjoy books like Diamond's ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" in which nature is brought into conformity with the author's vision, you'll probably like this one."
1,What a waste of opportunity!,"I started reading this book with great interest and anticipation-as the author was set to address one of the very universal, important and interesting aspect of human life -that is -the blue print of the life!In the second paragraph of the chapter one, author writes that he feels to be fortunate that he was born near the discovery place of the structure of DNA.Full stop.I closed the book and kept aside. My objection being the author showed his very mundane flavor of the book and it terribly put me off. I wished he was neither born or/and/both written this book.Can I give Zero Star?"
4,Not a Science Mumbo Jumbo Book,"This book is wonderfully written. Ridley is able to take an extremely gargantuan, not to mention complicated, subject and make it understandably compact for the readers who are not up to tabs on the latest genetic breakthroughs and discoveries (myself included). He doesn't swamp us with the extremely intricate, and on the occasion boring, vocabulary that the scientific world is filled with. The genome becomes more understandable and most importantly, relative to our lives. However, Ridley does not make his readers perfectly capable of explaining the nature and purpose of the genome - he makes the point in stating that most of the genome has yet to be explained. By reading this book, you'll simply have a better idea of what the genome is and if not that, it's hard to say that Genome isn't a fun read."
3,An pleasant appetizer,"Informative and often engaging. As the author suggests (dozens of times) this book was already outdated when released. I liked the chapters on heriditary disease and sexuality which would hold up as human interest stories and are a part of the popular debate that genetics has sparked.When the author laments about the inexact nature of science and then proceeds to offer widely available expert speculation, I am less interested.A book of personal narratives from scientists and civilians alike who have been dramatically impacted by the decoding of the genome is sorely needed."
5,Obsessive,"This book is the most thrilling piece I have read in a long time. What thrills me most, I believe, is that I am infinitely connected to the information contained within the pages. I absolutely could not put this book down - (I even took it to work with me). Each chapter was as thrilling as the last, with all focusing on the blueprint of the human race. This book will give you a better understanding of not only yourself - but of how interconnected we all are. This book is very well written in a way that your ""average joe"" could pick it up and follow along without a doctoral degree. This book should be required reading for the human race. These pages will give you an appreciation of how improbable it is that you should have ever existed, and a respect for all human life. I have a better understanding of myself than I had imagined this book could give me."
4,Very educational,"I'm currently a 9th grade student and find the DNA, RNA, etc. reviews extremely fascinating. I picked up this book and found it a wonderful read. You should try it if you would like to learn many news things in the molecular biology world."
5,Why exactly 23 chapters?,"This book helps the general reader safely navigate choppy waters while enjoying the view. The author uses his vast knowledge to help us gain some understanding of the developing field of the human genome. While some of his analogies seem far-fetched, and some of his pontificating is annoying, his 23 chapter ploy is good enough to keep you turning the pages."
3,I'm not convinced...,"I was one of those who thought there was something ""not quite right"" about Cobain's death, and Nick Broomfield's doc is certainly done with earnest concern, but I was left with no real evidence to support his claim. No doubt, Courtney Love was a control freak, and her father's ascerbic accounts of her adolescence were mean-spirited, but I was left with a better portrayal of Courtney than with Kurt. Also, considering this film was released in 1997, and no new evidence has been brought forth in 15 years, I'm writing this off as an earnest, but failed, effort. It just wasn't very interesting, at least for me."
2,I didn't know what to think,"Pursuing a theory that Courtney Love murdered Kurt Cobain, this Brit filmmaker digs up some strange dudes like El Duce, who says he was offered $50k by Love to whack Cobain. The voice-over narration is a bit smarmy, and the manipulation through editing is obvious to anyone with a sophistication about journalism. I'm not sure if the theory is true, but Love was never charged. She is no longer much heard from, however. Given that she was due to be divorced and lose out on millions, it's possible she could have murdered Cobain. More likely is that she drove him to it."
3,flawed,"A good documentry,but seriously flawed on the main clue that Courtney did do it...When he says it is proven that with his dose of heroin,he could've lived long enough to shoot himself because it has happened before.The person in question that they compared those results to was on methadone,which is similar to heroin,but is NOT heroin.Heroin is directly shot into the bloodstream,where as methadone takes a little bit longer.The guy who did this documentry didn't have any idea where it was going to go.First he wanted to make Courtney look bad,then he wanted to say she didn't kill him at all.He also failed to mention the piece of paper found in Courtney's bag a week after Kurt died.It had samples of kurt's handwriting and her's...trying to forge it.I basically summed it up in one paragraph:COURTNEY DID IT.And don't watch this documentry unless you want distorted truth and lies."
3,contraversy sells,"If you got caught up in the conspiracy theories of JFK or even Bill & Hillary - then this would be your kind of documentary. The whole thing was a little short - just 85 minutes - so this is just a taste of the subject...it kinda leaves you hanging. But it's got it all sex, drugs, rock n roll, deception, wierd parents, Divine Brown's pimp, everything that makes it watchable. But you can't help but roll your eyes a few times with the acquisations being thrown around. It'll give you enough to blow off the theory or intrigue you enough to search out a chat room or discussion group."
1,Journalistic piece that misses,"I watched this documentary with high expectations, and almost could not finish watching it as I was terribly disappointed with the volume of uncredible witnesses and undocumented facts.I could not help but to feel that Nick Broomfield was trying to make the viewer believe that he began his journalistic piece unbiased, and was only recounting the facts as they unfolded to him. The entire documentary felt contrived however. If he had included only credible witnesses to Kurt and Courtney's life together, the documentary would have been 30 minutes long. Perhaps it should have been only thirty minutes long.He never really goes into the facts of the suicide (murder?). I think a different director will one day put together a better documentary on this tragic event. Broomfield's misses."
1,what a waste,"This is not a particularly interesting, logical or even memorable documentary, except perhaps to those who harbor some kind of obsession for long-dead Nirvana front-man Kurt Cobain and harbor some kind of resentment or anger toward his widow, Courtney Love. The film questions the validity of the finding for suicide in Cobain's case and whether or not Courtney Love bears some or all of the culpability in his death (whether by driving him to suicide or by other more sinister means). No conclusions real conclusions can be drawn from this film except perhaps to find out how not to make a documentary. When sources can be bought for a beer and evidence is shady to non-existent, why bothering questioning?"
3,I did a high school report on it...,"...and I got an A, so it's informative! Unfortunately, it's not real high in entertainment value. In fact, I kept falling asleep during it, because nothing much happened. Also, the entire DVD is not ""new"", just the ""R"" version. Origionally it was unrated. My guess is that the entirely pointless satan-worshipping-orgy segment was cut out. I'll explain: The CD ""In Utero"" was inspired by a cult in California. The director found it neccessary to include a video-taping of a...""meeting"" of the cult in the video. A body is sacrificed and the cult bathes in its blood. (This was also the only reason why I couldn't show it to the whole school in the auditorium.)"
1,A Monumental Bore,"Whether you like or dislike Kurt or Courtney, whether or not you believe any of the conspiracy theories put forth here, well... it doesn't really matter. The film is so severely weighted down by extreme drudgery that you no longer care by the time its over. A chore to sit through. I was hoping for a little Nirvana music if nothing else, but we don't even get that. The voiceover says that Courtney Love's lawyers wouldn't let him use any. This is a repeated excuse that amounts to a film without much left. After 90 minutes of listening to dullards and dirtbags, you will begin to wish YOU had a bag of heroin and a shotgun!"
1,Save your money & 90 minutes of your life,"This ""documentary ""is a treasure trove of unsubstantiated claims, 3rd and 4th hand rumors, interviews with practicing junkies, and ""sources"" like a pimp,a psychic and an unemployed private investigator. Misogynistic attacks on Courtney from low-life hangers-on with acute cases of sour grapes (including her abusive father and ex-boyfriend). Who could blame Love for not wanting to participate in her own character assassination and the vampiric exploitation of Kurt's life at the hands of National Enquirer stalkerazzi? The film features no one from Nirvana or their record label-in short, no one who actually knows the real story. Makes Jerry Springer look like Masterpiece Theatre. Appalling on so many levels..."
1,Ehh,"As far as Im concerned, he could have been murderd or just as much commited suicide. No one will EVER know. Personally though I think he comitted suicide, but thats just me. If you want a good look at both sides, watch this movie then read Heavier Than Heaven, because it could change your thinking."
1,not worth the 3 bucks to rent the video.,"i'm am a nirvana fan, not a conspiracy fan. this film started out like a well written documentary then suddenly it seemed as if the film got a new producer or they ran out of money, or someone wanted to sell more videos, or get it out to a bigger ""tabloid"" reading and watching audience. it never really had any direction. i couldn't even watch the whole thing I got so upset. the people who made this film would have done better doing a story about tommy lee and pam."
2,Let the man die already!,"This ""documentary"" was just an excuse to slam Courtney, once again question her ""role"" in Kurt's death and generate press for Nick Bloomfield. How can I say this? Bloomfield himself doesn't believe the conspiracy theory. Even though he drudged up every person who ever stood in the grocery line with Courtney Love, he feels that there really is no substantial evidence against her. So that had nothing to do with the movie, you say. No, it has everything to do with it: this man is out to tar someone. So, when you watch it, keep that in mind.As for anything aside from the content and lack of convincing evidence: the audio can be bad at times (I understand...it's guerilla documentaries, yeah) and the people he interviews seem drunk/high and lend zero creedence to the film.Watch it if you are a fan of Nirvana or Hole. But don't view it as some sort of historical truth."
2,"If you love Courtney, Spare yourself and not watch","Well, I love Nirvana and always loved Hole and, yes, Courtney Love. However, this documentary can make even a devoted Hole fan question Courtney's role in Kurt's death. I don't think she hired anyone and even the director himself said he didn't believe the conspiracy theories. Thus, the only motivation I can see is spite. He makes Courtney look like a manipulating gold digger and Kurt, an innocent bystander to his own life. She loved him and he knew what he was doing when he shot himself. Why try to pin her as a killer?"
3,"Worth a look, but expect bias against Courtney Love","Kurt and Courtney is a well directed piece of film, owing much of it's greatness to Nick Broomfield. His editing techniques coupled with sinister musical overtones make the film worth watching. For actual content however, Kurt and Courtney lacks fabric. No Nirvana songs are used in a film which unashamedly points to Courtney Love as the reason for Kurt's death. Interviews with Hank Harrison and Dylan Carlson make for interesting viewing and a private investigator adds his two peneth worth. Overall, Kurt and Courtney struggles to draw many conclusions and is probably for die-hard fans only as there are some touching moments reliving Kurt's youth. That said, from the documentaries on offer on this subject, this is the best yet so take a look, I'd say it's worth it."
5,unfiltered truth,"Nick has real guts. He managed to presented the gray image of unfiltered truth in a really interesting way, he seems to have a knack for it based on his Heidi Flies movie. My conclusion was that Courtney and Kurt were both very unhealthy human beings. Kurt was famous for an artistic talent, Courtney is famous due to a knack for manipulation. Loved the ACLU scene, priceless."
2,oh no hes trying to get his courage up buying a soda,"its worth it to seea. the battery dieb. buying a soda to get his courage upc. 'i was overwhelmed by her beauty'd. sputtering out the word 'death' incoherently in an attemptto get to the subject.e. the great instrumental music that they play while theyhave a car shot in the rain. dunno who it is but its worthbuying.f. oh yeah, the dylan guy talking like the kid in the shining.'no mrs torence dont go in the greenhouse.' i like that guy."
5,mmmm,"kurt cobain is so hot in this video and although the movie itself sucks, just the fact that it is about kurt makes me love it!"
5,"Fascinating, A Wild Ride!","Nick Broomfield reminds me of Oliver Stone, he's not afraid to take chances while making a film. He displays that in his fascinating, entertaining and wild documentary, ""Kurt & Courtney."" Broomfield takes us into the dark side of the entertainment industry and raises many questions and gives some strange answers. I also loved all the strange characters here and the way this is more entertaining and alluring than your average documentary."
4,**Courtney Didnt Kill kurt!!!!**,"I gave this movie 4 stars becouse,I didnt like how it tried to make Courtney look like she had somthing to do with Kurts death. Although the movie did have some great footage and interviews of Courtney..She is so cool!...And Ithink alotta the people in the movie were full of crap. But if you do see this movie..Courtney had NOTHING at all to do with his death! and i can prove that!! Enjoy the movie!!!! **************************************************"
3,Courtney rules,yes...i AM a Hole freak...i only saw the movie because it has to do with courtney..she didn't f*%king kill him!!!
3,Not so interesting as I thought,"I'm a big NIRVANA and Kurt Cobain fan, and I had great expectations with this video, but with all the information I've read and seen, this one has LOTS of mistakes, even though the interview with Dylan Carlson was pretty ""interesting"". It's just a bunch of interviews, but it doesn't prove anything at all. It's kinda cool if you're a big NIRVANA fan, but I prefered Who killed Kurt Cobain instead"
3,see for yourself,this documentary may not be credible (i havent seen it but that seems to be the concensus) but that shouldnt discredit the possibility that kurt was murdered. read the facts in the timeline at www.justiceforkurt.com and see for yourself.
4,beautiful kurt,"the theories presented are very lame, but what saves this film is the breathtaking shots of kurt. his aunt is pretty cool and sincere, so is his friend dylan. otherwise, courtney's dad is very annoying, and so are the other characters. overall, it's worth a watch. you won't be disappointed if you don't expect a great piece."
3,Not Bad,"Way to shakey, it gave me a headache. A good movie about the theory of Kurt's Death, but no opinions on the suicide."
3,Good.,"I think that any Kurt Cobain fan would love the movie. I don't think Courtney Love killed him. I think that he really commited suicide, and she couldn't help him, because she was very busy thinking about herself."
2,Rediculous,"This film is full of some shaaaaady characters. The director never lets anyone finish their sentence and seems desperate to make his point.. They spend several minutes discussing how they're going to sneak up on Courtney Love during rehearsal, but right at the final moment the camera battery dies. Really? Come on. The final shot is an ultra zoomed in close up of Kurt deliberately trying to make him seem like some mysterious Sasquatch home video. I actualyl feel that the main idea behind the film is plausible, but this is just silly."
2,Sacrilege to compare with 80's legend bands.,"To compare this with the Smiths the Furs and the Cure..?is a sacrilege. It is far from those bands, not remotely in their league, and not even close to their sound..Its lite bouncy uninspired pop. Which is fine, but please be honest with musical comparisons, perhaps listen to the refered bands before using them as a reference."
3,"Some Authentication, please.","I suppose this is an interesting read for its intended audience..gay men and women looking for celebrity role models. I personally would have liked to have seen more documentation..a bibliography, something other than hearsay to back up the author's claims."
3,Lack of Accuracy flaws a really interesting book.,I like the section on my beloved Mathis...the book really couldhave used a bibliography. Otherwise there is a question as to thetruthfullness of some of the author's claims. END
2,Effective but not worth it,"I was looking for a simple orange peel to keep my fingernails from turning orange with residue. As Amazon gives FREE shipping on discounts on orders over a certain amount, I compromised on this orange peeler to get the free shipping.Unlike the simple peeler I grew up with, this one was BULKIER in width. The serrated edge to slice the peel's skin doesn't work well unless you pull it down at a certain angle and with a certain amount of pressure. If you're not careful, you may slice your own finger. The end that's used to pull up the peel from the flesh of the fruit would work better if the slicer worked better. But as it doesn't, the tool is rather inadequate all around. It's functional but not superior."
2,Awkward and Sharp,"I purchased several different brands of orange peelers, this one did not work for me as well as the Tupperware versions. It sure is hard to improve on such a simple and useful device. This one does help you peel oranges but it has some sharp saw teeth that might hurt someone especially young children (or ME!)."
2,Some good lessons - Not for a beginner,"I bought this book to review it as a possible text for a class I am teaching next year. I teach students with learning disabilities and need something that is easy to understand, as well as straight forward with a logical layout to the lessons. Although I understood most of the lessons (I have a couple years of FreeBSD and OS X experience under my belt), many of them were difficult to understand. If you want to brush up on your UNIX skills, this may be a good book to do it with, but unless you have a good deal of experience to help you along, this book will not help greatly."
1,This is an awful book,"This book is confusing and poorly written. It is wordy in the extreme. It dwells interminably on some simple things (logging in) and flies by some complex things (like what a shell is).I can not think of a worse introduction to Unix. You will be far better off going to Google and searching for ""Unix Primer""."
4,Still very relevant,I read this book as a text book for a class in American Foreign Policy that I took and I was surprized to find that it was still relevant to today's issues.Kennan's premise that our foreign policy is based on idealism rather than realism is still true. Some of the past incidents he covers parallel some of the same attitudes we have today in expecting foreign nations to act like we do.Our naive idea that Iraq could be turned into a western style democracy is addressed in the historical episodes described by Kennan. The use of the media in the Spanish American war parallels our present experience.We seem to base our foreign policy on our perceptions of the world as we think it is rather than a realistic evaluation of what is really going on.
2,KNITTING EMPORIUM - DON'T BUY UNLESS YOU LOOK,"Unless you have a chance to check this book out at a bookstore first, OR you're a beginning knitter, don't buy it online. The patterns couldn't be more ordinary, despite the use of color on several. Anyone looking for fun and interesting patterns will be extremely disappointed."
2,"Cheesy at best, Horrible at worst.","2 Stars for effort. That's about it. The actors were not convincing, the costumes and scenes were unrealistic, and the dialogue horrible. True, this movie was made in the beginning of the 80's, but I could not sit through the entire movie. The view of women in the movie is awful (the scene with Egraine naked and Uthur in a full suit of armor comes to mind). If you want to see a really good adaption of the King Arthur legend, see Merlin. Now that movie deserved 5 stars."
2,Terribly bad movie...,"I won't even get into how far from the litterary sources this movie is. Rather, let's consider that: in one of the first scenes, Arthur's father makes love with Ygerne ... wearing a full plate armor. I understand that he's in a hurry (she's married to one of his knights), but still... I just hope for both of them that no sensitive part of their anatomy got caught between 2 pieces of the articulated armor...Later in the movie, knights fight a tournament using a totally unpractal weapon (that never existed at ANY time...) that looks like a set of barbells with points...During the last battle, Mordred wears a golden (?) armor with a full mask... No comment...I'm all for some artistic license, but I draw the line at this utter lack of realism. In addition, the movie is plain *boring*!I'm giving 2 ** for the use of Carmina Burana in the soundtrack..."
3,huh??,"I don't expect anything more from a movie than to enjoy it and to be entertained. I don't attempt to psychoanalyze nor offer up an in-depth technical crtitque, it's only a movie. I either enjoy it or I don't. I bought this on the strength of the reviews here on Amazon. This movie wore me the hell out. I was able to tolerate it better once Arthur got past the beardless squire stage. In the beginning he reminded me of a character in a bad Japanese B movie. I will give it another try sometime, maybe it will grow on me..."
2,"Fair but nothing to be ""amazed"" by.","I own this DVD only because it was given to me for Christmas. I myself would never buy it. When I first saw Excalibur back in the 80's, I thought it was rather boring. Today I don't think it is as much boring as it is dark and dull. The acting is pretty bad and any of the characters are likable. Arthur's voice annoys the heck out of me and the rest seem to be unhappy with their lives and always mad at each other. Merlin runs around and, like a broken record, does his magic with a single spell. Speciall effects are very poor, too. The scene where Uther, under Merlin's spell, rides his horse on the way to Tintagel Castle made me laugh. He looked like riding on one of those ""quarter-horse-toys"" that can be found in a shopping mall. I gave Excalibur two stars because it is overall ""watchable"" and it does have a few good scenes. However, I consider it as a one time event."
4,"This is not ""La Morte de Arthur""","After reading ""La Morte de Arthur"", I purchased this dvd. I bought it in part because I was told that it did an excellent job of following the book. I was deceived. The movie takes care to leave the names of characters but little else remains. There isn't a scene that isn't ""glamorized"" in Hollywood fashion, with most scenes completely fabricated to give the movie modern appeal. It is unfortunate that so many have mistakenly claimed ""Excalibur"" as a close remake of the original book, that Sir Thomas Malory's telling of the story is unknown, even by those who quote it. I gave the movie four stars because it is an entertaining film and fascinating fairy tale. The one star was subtracted for making so many think that ""Excalibur"" was the film version of ""La Morte de Arthur""."
1,Never could get to see the entire film,The tales of Arthurian England have always been among my favorite. However I cannot get this video to down load to my system and I have no problem with any other system down loading.If Amazon does not fix its problem I shall not renew my prime account.
1,One of the worst movies every created,"I saw this movie in the theatre when it was released. I thought it was laughable and ridiculously bad then. I just watched it again on Amazon (for free, thank god); and it is every bit as bad as I remembered. It boggles my mind that anyone could say anything remotely positive about this atrocity. The acting is horrid; the script is idiotic, the cinematography is overwrought, the fight scenes would make the Keystone Kops meet the Three Stooges look sublime in comparison. The armor - don't get me started on the armor. Even the use of Wagner and Carl Orff provokes fits of giggles. Anyone who takes this film seriously needs to go watch a truly serious film masterpiece, like Ghidra the Three-Headed Monster or most anything by Ed Wood. Or even the Wild Women of Wongo!"
3,Old Movie,I thought this would be a little more enjoyable but instead I was a little disappointed. I should have rented it from the library
1,"Swords, schmords","Forgot that I walked out of a theater after the first 15 minutes of the start of this thing and then bought it. Ugh, what a boo boo. Certainly tastes are different for different folks, but if you like tales of the Round Table, this one shouldn't be on your list. From the acting of the character that does Merlin to the destruction of the legend, this thing gets worse the longer it is watched. Think it was given to a neighbor that I didn't like and he didn't know it at the time. He does now."
4,Visually Stunning,"The film is magnificent. By far the best telling of the classical tales of King Arthurs' knights. If you loved the visuals on VHS version, you will be blown away by the DVD version. The colours are clear and pure and the 5.1 sound track is not to bad, although it could have been better.Even if you already own a VHS copy, a DVD copy is well worth it."
5,"Spellbound from first viewing of this John Boorman film,",I first became enchanted with this film version of Sir Author and the Knights of the day in the early 80's. The DVD format should be exciting and seems quite on target for new millenium passage!!! This film is a classic.
5,The once and future kings of fantastics films,"Seeing Excalibur again in 1999 offers new rewards--namely the screen presence of unknowns Patrick Stewart and Liam Neeson as two of Arthur's knights. Of course Patrick Stewart graduated to his own Camelot in Space on board the starship Enterprise and Neeson is playing a Jedi Knight in the new Star Wars movie. So Excalibur gets an all-star cast before its time, appropriately so, given the time-conscious themes. Boorman presents the Arthur stories beautifully, economically, wasting little in highlighting the stories of Uther, the sword in the stone, the meeting with Lancelot, and perhaps most moving, the story of Perceval's quest for the Grail, highlighted brilliantly by Wagner's music to Parsifal. This is operatic cinema at its best, and Excalibur ranks with Star Wars as one of the great mythic adventure movies."
5,What is used from your lust..Shall be mine...And you'll have it!,"By Excalibur I SWEEAARRR IT! John Boorman's masterpieceof Arthur should be seen from everyone.It is a classictale that seems to be filmed every 7-10 yrs. I stillbelieve this is the best version.For the performancesfrom Nicole Williamson(uuummm! Hello OSCARS???)Gabriel(I just plain kick a$$)Byrne and many more! The factthis is Rated R just enhances the movie that much more.Sorry Kiddies but if you are looking for a nice/softversion of King Arthur and Merlin with the long greybeard you will be very dissapointed,for the EX doesNOT F#$K AROUND! The directing is flawless and themusic is ONE of the best in film history!Totallyrecommend in any AMAZONERS DVD shelf!!! BUY ITWATCH IT....LIVE IT!.........All I can give youis my love.....""THAT'S THE ONE THING OF YOURS I DON'TWANT!I WILL COME AND TAKE CAMELOT BY FOOOOORRRCCEE!""BRILLIANT BOORMAN....JUST BRILLIANT!LONG LIVE THE EX!"
1,Blu-ray version rated PG?,I absolutely love this movie! This is my all time favorite movie!! I saw that it's being released on Blu-Ray and was very pumped till I saw that they are releasing it in the PG version. That version of the movie is completely useless and you miss huge chunks of important plot. The PG version should be buried in a deep hole somewhere and never shown again! I will not be buying this version for any amount of money and if someone gives it to me as a gift I'll tell them to send it back! Man I'm just soooo upset about this!!
1,Hate it,"The DVD is BLANK, There is no movie on the disc! None, nada, zippo, nothing! To ship it back would cost more than it is worth."
4,SWORD PLAY,"John Boorman's film is beautifully filmed and staged. The battles are convincing; they are not pretty and there is much dismemberment and agony. Boorman's vision of the Arthurian legend is handled reverently, although at times it appears he took on too much. The search for the Holy Grail comes out of nowhere; Guinevere falls in love with Lancelot without any interplay or reasoning; Arthur becomes old and disheartened without any real background. However, the performances from the likes of Helen Mirren, Nicol Williamson, Liam Neeson and Gabriel Byrne are ferocious, and even though Nigel Terry doesn't possess the heart of Arthur and Nicholas Clay is too wimpy a Lancelot, the film overall is a cavalcade of wonder and awe, with a wonderful musical score to boot.I loved EXCALIBUR when it first appeared in 1981; now I like it for what Boorman tried to do, and coming out on top more often than not."
2,FORMAT ERRORS,"I have admired this film since it came out in 1981 and under normal circumstances would give it a four or five star rating. However, unfortunately the DVD issued this year is not in the correct widescreen format. It appears to have been made by matting a ""pan and scan"" TV master tape. I wrote the distributor on this and they simply indicated that I could return it for credit. If you want to see the film in its original full widescreen format you should check out the laser disc. Hopefully, eventually Warners will release a correctly formatted dvd."
1,Very Dissapointed,"Being a fan of Merlin, and The Mists of Avalon, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. How disappointed I was with it. Even with extensive knowledge of King Arthur, I found the story line hard to follow! It appeared that the 'actors' were reading from cue cards, the 'acting' itself was fragmented, and the entire story disjointed. I kept waiting for the story to become more interesting, and at several points I was tempted to turn the movie off. I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone who has a love of King Arthur. If this is your first movie of that genre, don't bother - you won't even understand the lore."
3,Excalibur [Blu-ray],"I love the movie, it would be 5 stars, BUT...the quality of the blu-ray disc: It is grainy all the time and it crops the top and bottom of the movie!!! WHY??? Finally, the least important, the packaging is ""spartan"" just the plain disc. Maybe a good quality DVD looks better and with NO cropping !"
4,Great movie added to my collection,I purchased this movie along with the Mists of Avalon. They make a great combination. They tell the whole story well together of King Arthur.
2,Excalibur DVD,The film is excellent but the DVD I purchased from Amazon.com stopped several times (froze) while playing and we were unable to watch the whole thing. There are plans to exchange or return it.
4,Excalibur,It's great! Just like new. It's every bit as beautiful as the first time I saw during its theatrical release.
5,Unforgettable adaptation,"""Excalibur"" is the greatest cinematic interpretation of the Arthurian legend, and perhaps the best film ever made in the fantasy genre. Yes, the movie has flaws: the dialogue can be a little goofy at times, the acting somewhat- shall we say - idiosyncratic, the special effects don't always work, and the internal logic is not always apparent (the Grail is Arthur? Arthur is the land? et al). But those flaws are very easily forgotten when this movie is taken as a whole. I've never seen cinematography like it; it's like watching a dream or seeing a Pre-Raphaelite painting brought to life. Combine that with the Wagnerian music (although I would have preferred Stokowski to Solti), and some scenes manage to achieve the highest Gesamtkunstwerk ideal. If you even have a shred of imagination left, you'll find something to love in this movie."
5,Great Movie!,"This movie is one of my favorites. If you love Science Fiction and Fantasy, you should love this movie. This movie did not have stars that were familiar to me, but they did an excellent job. Especially Nigel Terry as Merlin. Wonderful performance. It is the story of King Arthur with a few new twists that really grabbed my interest. This movie had everything. Action, adventure, drama, intrigue and romance. I just loved it!"
2,Excalibur,I tried watching it about 3x - but kept falling asleep. I'm not sure if it was the production (audio and video) or the storyline. I would have really like to have watched again but with others. I was watching alone and they have been part of the problem.
1,One of the worst films I have ever seen,"Some years ago I got dragged to see this movie. The next day I mentioned to my boss I had just seen what might be the worst movie ever made. His reply was that no, he had been forced to sit through the worst he had ever seen, mine couldn't be as bad. To make a long story short, we had both seen Excalibur."
1,Horrible cinematography.......B movie!,"I have read the above reviews and find it very hard to believe I watched the same movie as the others. I found it to be horribly filmed, with a B movie flavor!"
2,The worst Blu-Ray transfer of all time,"I love this movie, and couldn't wait for it to be released on Blu-Ray. The transfer is sadly horrible - the framing of the movie chops off more heads (or whatever is at the top of the frame) than the Load High Executioner (yes, I checked to make sure I wasn't accidentally setting the TV picture size to an artificial wide-screen size), and the images are grainier then a ""normal"" DVD, and just ridiculously un-sharp for Blu-Ray. If it weren't for the packaging, I'd swear this was a cheap rip-off bootleg."
2,Disappointingly clunky film,"This could & should have been so much better. One wonders how a really good director capable of making Point Blank & Deliverance created this.... First, there's the casting. While I have no problems with Terry, Lunghi or Clay in more contemporary parts, they're really in way over their heads as Arthur, Guinevere & Lancelot. Perhaps it's the curse of modernism that makes so many actors today so bloody self-conscious & low-key. It seems to effect the overall staging as well making the round table scenes look like a 1960s fashion shoot ...cocktail party. While on the subject, why are all the knights wearing their (brightly polished?!) armor to table? This looks like something intended for 5th graders. From Prince Valiant to Excalibur, movies haven't done well by Arthur. My recommendation: read The Once & Future King (White) AND Arthur Rex (Berger), two brilliantly written, enthralling books."
5,Perfect seller!,The movie was exactly as described and the transaction flawless. All my queations were answered and the communication was excellent! Would definitely use this seller again! A+++
3,Too much story for the movie,"The story of Camelot is a wonderful one. The problem is, there are too many characters and far too many events and story-arcs to fit into a movie of a reasonable length. This movie became long and it still was not enough time for anything like sufficient character development and sufficient character interaction. The next time someone tells this story using this medium, I hope that they either create a miniseries or limit the story with respect to point of view. So many different point of views are fascinating: Arthur's, Merlin's, Morganna's, Guinevere's, Mordred's, Lancelot's, even Percival's.It's always a bad sign in a movie when the music gets louder.It means that the music is trying to generate the emotion which is missing from the characters and their interactions.Still, there were some very nice bits. I liked how Arthur asked to be knighted and I liked the story bit about Uther."
1,Dated,"The movie is dated, shown it's age. Can't watch because of the acting, the way that they speak, everything's just outdated"
4,It still enchants,I remember when I saw this movie when it first appeared. I was mesmerized and I had to see it again and again. Merlin is unforgettable!
4,"Not the Once and Future King..., but it will do","This movie does not follow the original telling of the King Arthur legend very well, but, it is one of the most visually stunning movies since Blade Runner, and the music (by Wagner) is wonderful. If you enjoy fantasy or romance then this movie is for you."
3,Good film.,"Excalibur was a good movie but flawed. Some of the acting was very average as well as the screenplay itself. Never the less, John Boorman did a spectacular jod directing. Several scenes for very powerful.Including the final battle with Mordred. I also thought that the scoring was effective. This film may seem visualy dated now, but it does not matter. If you are a big fan of the Arthurian legend, this is a must see."
5,Recived,"It was a gitf,she loved it. What more can I say,it wasnt for me.blah blah blah blah blah blah blah"
5,great film,"This is one of the great films of the last 20 years, and my favourite. For some reason it is not as well known as it should be. For me it should be in the top ten films of all time.For Americans I would like to say that all the accents in the film are English, maybe apart from Liam Neeson.We do not all speak like Hugh Grant. The range of accents in England are far more deverse than anything you would find in America. Maybe this is not the most important issue but I thought I would set the record straight."
5,Great movie,"This film is one of the best movies about the life of King Arthur, I really enjoyed the character of Merlin. Every-one should atleast check this film out atleast once."
3,5 stars for movie but blu-ray quality ify,The blu-ray quality here doesn't seem as good as others I've seen but then this is a pretty old movie. Don't think it's worth it to upgrade to blu-ray if you already have this in standard definition.
4,Great Atmosphere -- Wonderfully Unique,"this is a good and clear DVD of an underrated movie.first, i'm not sure this movie stays 'faithful' to the legends simply because there are so many versions of the Arthurian myths; the more important elements (getting the sword, Merlins interactions w/Uther, Arthur and Morgan, Lancelot and Gwenevere, the last battle w/Modred) however, Excalibur did take liberty and combined key characters (i assume for easier continuity) like having one character fill the roles of Percival, Galahad and Bedivere.minor details aside, this film is wonderfully atmospheric with a nod to Kurasowa in cinematography. its stylish and broodish ambience is maintained throughout the film. the main story is intact and coherent, though the acting can be more dynamic. this movie was made to be seen on letterbox and the mostly Wagerian score is effectively used.a must for those interested in the Arthurian legends but also worth seeing for all movie fans."
5,"Outstanding ""Story""","If you do not enjoy a ""story"", then this movie is not for you. Do not expect a ""slice 'em and dice 'em"" action packed ""shoot 'em up"" movie. This is not it. This is a wonderful story of a mythical past. Remember, this movie was made over 20 years ago and the special effects and acting reflect that. There are no eye sizzling computer animated creatures or scenes. However, if you get into the story of King Arthur, Sir Lancelot, Excalibur & the Knights of the Round Table; you will enjoy this film. I give this movie five stars because I love the legend."
4,King Arthur loyalists will love it!,"I don't know how anyone could find this film cheesy. This is one of the truest tellings of the Knights of the Round table legend. I, for one, was glad that a 'Tom Cruise' or 'Keanu' wasn't playing the main roles. In fact, the main parts are played by relatively unknown actors. The story is captivating, and looks quite lush on DVD. Interestingly enough, though, if you're looking for big-name actors, there are many in supporting roles. Liam Neeson, Gabriel Byrne, and Patrick Stewart appear in minor roles. Keeping in mind that this film was made in 1981, I found the effects quite up to par and entertaining. Bottom line, if you find King Arthur stories fascinating, as I do, you must purchase this DVD. The price of this DVD makes it a steal. Trust me, you'll be happy you bought it."
4,"A great rendition of the tale, even if the armor is wrong...","Nobody can accept that Arturus probably wasn't going around in full plate armor, because it is really flashy and makes good cinema. Oh, well. Still, the story is done VERY well, with an amazing blend of sword and sorcery, much like the real thing.The lighting, sets, and characters are done very vividly, even if it surprised me to see Patrick Stewart in the middle of the Sword scenes. I just expect him to draw a phaser and take out the opposing forces, I guess.My wife loves Merlin. I have to replay his lines several times just to make her happy. Well, as they say, if the wife ain't happy, ain't nobody happy, so we replay a lot.Gotta love DVDs! They don't stretch like VHS tape!"
2,A boring failure,"I just saw this movie in its entirety for the first time and I have to say that it is one of the worst that I've ever seen. I don't see how other reviewers can say that the acting, music, and directing were done well. The voices sound dubbed, the music is heard only a couple times throughout the whole movie, and the scenes are very sloppy as you are never quite sure what is actually going on. Merlin's character is a teeter totter. Sometimes he's weak and stupid, sometimes he's strong and wise. If I was directing this movie I wouldn't focus on one character and then abandon him while trying to involve other characters. As for the special effects, they are terrible even for 1981. I spent most of this movie bored and confused."
1,One of the most BORING movies I have ever seen!,"I finally gave in and purchased this DVD based on the high reviews I have heard from people over the years. I couldn't have been more disappointed! What in the world were they thinking?? I found the movie miscast, poorly acted, poorly scripted, visually dark and dull, and (as is typical for the most boring of movies) painfully long! Save yourself some money by renting or borrowing this movie before you buy it."
1,Horrible Move,We tried watching this for an hour and gave up. The acting is horrible. It was like a junior high school play with people hollering at each other. I'll never understand how this thing got such high ratings. Save your money; it isn't worth 5 cents.
1,Oh brother...,"My husband and I had seen this in the theatre when it was first released. We remembered it as ""really good""...Well apparently tastes change. After 17 years (and one Lord of the Rings Trilogy!) this one makes you laugh or cringe-depending on the scene. The only good part was Sir Percival throwing the sword back to the Lady of the Lake at the end. Thr rest was a lot of clanking, hoof beats, yelling (was everyone deaf?) and hacking. Just plain dumb."
4,The Blu-Ray transfer is superior to the DVD,"I put on the DVD of Excalibur for the first time with my HD TV and was surprised at the poor transfer, I had watched before, I knew it wasn't good, on a large HD TV it's unacceptable. The Blu-Ray is not perfect but the transfer is much improved. For $10 it's a buy."
5,Superb and erotic! Another masterpiece by John Boorman!,"Excalibur left me speechless. It portrays the legend of King Arthur in masterful detail and erotic sensation. The love triangle of Artrhur, Lancelot, and Gwenevier is illustrated in great drama. The vindictiveness of Morgana and the mystery of the great wizard Merlin enhance the movie's fantastic plot. The only fault with the film was its confusing conclusion. Perhaps Boorman will one day do a remake and create an improved conclusion. However, the film was still excellent through and through."
1,I have no idea why this film has such a good reputation...,"because I really didn't think it was good at all. First of all, it's boring. The first time I tried to watch it, I feel asleep. Second of all, I wasn't impressed at all by the acting. the only character I thought was believable was Merlin--and admittedly the Merlin of EXCALIBUR is one of my favorite portrayals of him--but his scenes with Morgana were just ridiculous. I didn't care for the fantasy land she trapped him in at all. And, speaking or Morgana, I know this is trite, but she is just not convincing with blond hair! Plus, she was too much like a dominatrix or something in this film. I know she's supposed to be evil, but she was pretty anachronistic in this portrayal. Overall I'd say, if you want a good film portrayal of the Arthurian legends, your best bet is the Mists of Avalon, the TNT miniseries."
1,They sent me a copy that would not play!!,"Love this movie!But the copy I got would not play in my DVD player!Thanks for nothin""!"
1,Excalibur,After reading good reviews of this movie I decided to buy it. That's the last time I will ever do that! I'll sum up my feelings about this movie in a few words. Excalibur is bloody awful and one of the worst movies I've ever seen on this subject. What a total piece of garbage and a complete waste of my time! DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!
1,my mistake,"I failed to notice the number that tells what region the DVD is playable in.As a result, we here in the US where unable to watch it.I could send it to my friends in the UK but I doubt it is worth the effort."
4,Legendary Vision,"Tremendous film with lots of legendary imagery. Cleverer than it's given credit for. People criticise the unrealistic armour for the dark ages, and the stylised production, but it's a projection of the fully evolved myth as later medieval folk might have envisaged it. Impossible to have more appropriate and inspiring music, all part of the Germanic mythological world which Wagner wrote for.Other highlights for me: Uther Pendragon copulating with Igraine in full plate armour, and the special effects of a red light bulb for the setting sun!My only real criticism's are a weak Arthur, but I could appreciate the challenge of showing a chraracter develop from dithering peasant to great King. Also, I'm not quite sure if Nicol Williamson was a trifle too eccentric in his portrayal of Merlin! The movie is great fun, if you suspend reality - it is a 'myth', after all."
4,I was not allowed to see it... So I snuck in anyway!,"My mom, for whatever reason, told me I was not allowed to see it... So I snuck in to see it a week after it opened! It is great to see it again after all these years. It is also interesting to see all the superstars that were just getting their start in this film."
5,King Arthur perhaps at his best!,"I have loved this movie since I was in junior high. (Pretty much since it was released) It's a great story... great film... And MOST of the Arthurian bases are covered here. Being a big fan of the Arthur myth, I know what's accurate & what is not. Excalibur DOES Hollywoodize the story, combining characters & switching some events that certain characters do & giving them to others. But it is still a great story, well told, with great acting, good costumes & plenty of swords & sorcery, and not ""corny"" sorcery either. I highly recommend it! If for no other reason than to see Patrick Stewart & Liam Neeson very early in their careers!! And it still dates well also!"
5,Love it,"This is an incredible mythical story. I really love this movie. I have always like knight and gothic tales but, this was well done and the battle scenes were good too. Classic tale of King Arthur brought to life in a large scale way."
5,The sword! You promised me the sword!,"I had the privilege to see this movie when it first came out in the theatres, although I was just a teen. I was aware it was more than just your typical 70s films. It was moral poetry and costume designing was very realistic and still today, I mean...not just wonderful acting, costume design is very authentic in appearance. This film, Excalibur is one of my favorite having to do with Knights, if not my actual favorite. In regards to picture quality, it's an excellent copy.Arthur: This excellent knight, who fought with fairness and grace, was meant to win. ... whose power was meant to unite all men... not to serve the vanity of a single man."
4,Miraculous Technology,"Well the miracles of modern technology worked well for this movie. It is a true classic, and the digital remastering makes it truly spellbinding. If you can watch the first ""Lady of the Lake"" scene without going ""Ooh"" at the image, I'll be surprised.There are some errors nonetheless. There's a spot between scenes where the disc pauses momentarily for some unknown reason, and some scenes look like they could use more touching up. The audio is for the most part well done, though there are times where it could be fuller. But let's remember this movie wasn't made yesterday, so we can't expect Matrix level image and sound.All in all this movie is well worth getting on DVD, and is a vast improvement over the VHS version."
4,"Pretty convincing argument that Becker was ""framed""","This book covers what could be called NYC's ""OJ"" case. Charlie Becker was a crooked, ruthless cop. But did he REALLY order the execution of a gambling boss who had gone to the press about police corruption? ATE makes a pretty convincing case for his having been ""framed"" by the political powers that be.The book also offers lots of glimpses into the old NY underworld."
4,Excellent 2nd CD.,"WOW! I love it when artists come back the second time around with an even stronger effort. That's what Dierks Bentley has done with Modern Day Drifter. His vocals are crisp and clean and his lyrics to just about every track are the 'stuff' of great writing and composition. Dierks is a naturally sensual man and he makes the most of it in his art and craft. In short, he's smart and uses his God given gifts. Most artists fail in that insight.www.waideriddle.com"
4,Excellent Sophomore From Dierks!,"After the success of his debut this is Dierks 2nd offering and he just gets better!Included are his big hits Lot Of Leavin' Left To Do,Come A Little Closer and Settle For A Slowdown-the last 2 are excellent ballads.He also has some other gems like Domestic,Light And Cold,So So Long and Good Things Happen which Alison Krauss provides harmonies on.But the real standout is the beautiful touching ballad Gonna Get There Someday-I love the gorgeous fiddle arrangement on this.Dierks has one of the best male voices in country music.It's a pleasure to hear him sing.This album and artist is an essential to any country collection."
2,Not impressed.,"I decided to give Mr. Bentley a try and buy his cd. I knew the popular songs from the radio (Lot of Leavin' Left to Do, Come a Little Closer, Settle for a Slowdown). However, besides those songs I didn't care for this album. I would recommend downloading the songs by themselves rather than the entire album."
4,I am hooked,"First time I have heard his music and I love it...some songs are a little twangy, but overall - great CD!"
3,Good Modern Country,The songs are good and enjoyable. It is good modern country. I think he is getting better with each album.
4,Dierk rules,"This is a great country album. It has everything,Classic country song sounds,todays sound,love songs.....it's got it all!"
5,Love this man...,"Watched this last night - he was a major hunk when he was young and even at 78, he is still a hunk. I'm so glad I found him."
3,The verdict is still out,Well after doing research and deciding to get these I ordered them and they came veery promptly. Both my coworker and I started using them. After a couple of weeks we both started getting nauseous after taking them so ultimately we stopped taking them. Delivery was great tho and maybe for others it won't be a problem.
5,The Writer's Friend is more than a friend,"This excellent little book is a giant in its field. It is more than interviews with editors, it is a wealth of advice with practical and workable examples. If you want to see your work published follow Kyle,Gregg and McAlary's profound visions on the process. Their tips and sage advice help you establish sound, publishable writing and if you follow them, will give you an edge in the publishing world. I highly recommend this magnificant book as an absolute must have for any writer's book shelf."
5,One of the best C&C games of all time,"I say ""One of"" because Generals is the best. But this isn't about Generals is it?Yuri's Revenge is extremely addicting. After about 1 year you'll get tired of it, but meanwhile you will be spending more time trying to figure out new strategies then the time spent at school.How fun is it you ask? Extremely fun. Especially if you're into Starcraft or Age of Empires. It's much simpler, and that's what I adore about the C&C; games. You click and point and build.What's more fun than blasting the butt off an enemy? Invading their base with Prism Tanks and turning the base to a pile of rubble in a couple minutes, given that the computer doesn't nail you with air support or Apocalypse Tanks.I've been playing C&C; games for a few years now, and this is one of the best games ever, right under Generals. My advice is to buy it immediately, you won't regret it!"
3,Red Alert 2 was better,"I had really liked Red Alert 2 and thought this would be just as good. It has a lot of new units and features, but I expected more. It was worth buying, though. you can get a patch for it that fixes Red alert 2's non-obvious problems.But you can no loger make multiple Tanyas. It also has a lot of errors, but my computer does that with most games anyway."
2,its ok not a bad game,"not a bad game much like the previous command and conquer games.but very short, missions are not to difficult,game takes to long to load,not enough missions to play, plus you cannot switch and play as yuri against the allied and russians.overall compared to the previous command and conquer games,which i loved i would only give this a 2 possibly a 1."
3,So-So Add on.,I played this game already. The original Red Alert 2 was better since the campaigns were much longer. I was also suprised there was not a Yuri campaign. You are only able to play Yuri in multiplayer or skirmish. I would expect expansions to be more difficult. The only reason I gave it three stars was because the story behind Yuri's Revenge was very Humorous. In other words how Yuri ends up at the end of each campaign. Some new units were interesting as well. I took off 2 stars since it was easy even on difficulty of high. It took me only 3 days to complete all the single player missions.
3,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!,"This is another brilliant masterpiece made by westwood producers but buy something more worthwhile. Yes it is pretty cool yuris revenge does have some new vehicles, maps, and single player campaigns. But I played yuris revenge once its basically the same thing as Red ALert 2 same grapics same gameplay. So after playing it once I just stuck to the regular RA2 and uninstalled yuris revenge. Kind of a boring expansion pack if you ask me. Waste of memory, waste of time, but worst of all waste of your money! Please take my heed of advice and go buy some tinkertoys or something. unless you have some money to burn!"
1,Too many problems!!!,"The actual game is ok, but it not worth the wait to play the game. Just to get to the main menu takes over 10 minutes, and then each mission takes anywhere from 5-20 minutes to load. Plus when you finally get to play, you are constantly kicked out the game to due ""irregular internal errors."" I know it's not my computer because I'm not the only one with these problems, and my computer exceeds all the requirments, and plays all other games great.Westwoods website blames the problems on a cd burner or other cd drive. I followed all their suggestions to remedy the many problems, and the game does not work any better.This game is just a waste of money, since all it will do is sit and load for 20 minutes and then get an error or lock up."
1,To Easy.,"I have been playing games like Tiberian Sun, RedAlert ect. But when I got RA2 I was dissopinted, I could kill my oppenents very quickly. This game makes me think westwood should get out of the field of RTS games, I played the game for a week and have not touched it since. That is the same for Yuri's revenge, I have no trouble killing 30 brutes then destroying my oppenent at all. They proboly made this games for little kids who were having to much trouble playing games like Tiberian Sun. So I suggest that you do not buy this game. It is a complete wast of money. If you want a good game Get Tiberian Sun. Or Shogun Total war."
5,Yuri Power,"This is a really good game, excellent story, nice grapgics and detailed backgrounds, and this is a game for everyone."
1,dont,this never played the code was bad and the company never responded to calls or letters what a waist of money
5,great!!!,I buy for my son and really is fantastic he play a lot of time.Remember that you need the firt part of Red Alert.
5,Great book with a lot of helpful info,This is a very moving book about a mother who will not take no for an answer and searches on her own to find the answers she needs. She fights for her child to make her life better. There is a vast amount of information for other families who have a child who is autistic or special needs. Thank You so Much for writing this book.
4,An overall good game,"This is a pretty good game. then why four stars? Well, I was really disapointed when i saw the graphics, i was expecting them to be better than what they are. i didn't play this game more than an hour a day, and it still only took me three days to master it. i played it for two weeks and it got too easy, so i went back to the ps2. when i first got it all i really wanted to do is play my course, but it doesn't take long to master that area. its always easy to make the first ten holes, but then it gets tricky to fit in the rest of the holes, and you start making all these crazy and extremely short holes that the players don't like. i recomend doing sandbox mode first, it really teache yu how to fit in your holes. but it doesn't teach you how to spend you money. but it only takes me three years to be a millionair now. if you don't play computer every day of the week, you will enjoy playing this game."
2,Fun... for a few hours,"This game was fun when I first got it. I am not a fan of golf, but I am a fan of sim games, so I thought ""What the heck. why not?"" BIG MISTAKE! The game is NOT worth the price (money) because after a few hours of watching little sim people play on your course, you get a little bored. If you are not a fan of golf I do not recomend this game for you. If you are a fan of golf, you will probably enjoy it."
1,Spare yourself (and your computer) the grief...,"The demo for this game {if one could call it that) was on the Sims Hot Date, or some expansion for the Sims. It seemed pretty fun, and since they restricted you to 3 courses, I really wanted to know what it was like to build a big golf resort. And so, I got caught in the trap. I went out and bought Sim Golf... The worst waste of money in my life. I quickly became bored with the different buildings (there are so few!), and although the course building tool was kind of interesting, it was far from addicting...The actual golfing aspect of the game required no skill, and the houses you build for celebrities are a plain waste of time...It is a plain waste of time, money, and of course, megabytes. I can't wait 'till the Sims Superstar comes out...Don't make the same mistake I did, and get a better game. This is just a plain disgrace."
2,its the best golf simulation yet,sid meiers sim golf is worth every penny of the price ... easily the best game this season the only problem is i dont know how to save mt game.p.s. no one has payed me to say this
4,Great Game -- But Don't Expect More Updates,"I love this game. I have enjoyed participating in some of the online forums where you can share courses with other people, and download their courses. I've enjoyed the challenge of trying to improve my Skill stats. I even (sort of) enjoy playing the courses, especially high Imagination courses.Unfortunately, Firaxis and EA have abandoned this game. There are bug fixes that ,while minor, should be fixed. There are features that need to be added. But it won't happen. The only additions that you will be able to find are those that have been created by the SimGolf community itself.The game has promise. Too bad it's been abandoned so soon after it's birth."
4,Sid Meiers Sim Golf (pc),A good game for all ages to play when bored on occasions but not a game that will entertain you for hours.
3,Got old fast,"I enjoyed SimGolf for the first few hours I played it. Building a highly rated course was a fun challenge. I eventually learned the 'template' to creating highly rated holes, however this 'template' doesn't mesh with realistic golf.I play the traditional three-click swing golf games, and I was not challenged with the method of playing the course presented here.SimGolf is not a bad game. I got several hours of enjoyment out of it, but it then became quite tedious."
5,The Demo alone is 5 stars.,"Having read some interesting press on this game, I decided to download the demo. For the record, I like SimCity, Alpha Centauri, and other games these designers have separately participated in. I am not a big fan of The Sims, however, as I find it repetitive. The Demo starts out a lot like Roller Coaster Tycoon, another favorite of mine. If that had been it, I would have stopped there and stuck with RCT. However, working out the course design is wickedly fun and engrossing, with some interesting tools to help (including graphs of how the golf ball will behave in the hands of SimGolfers of different skill). I played the Demo solidly for 4 hours without realizing it. The fact that you can ""play"" a round of golf and select shots for your SimGolf pro (with shades of ""The Sims"" like personality selection) makes this even more addictive."
3,Good game.....for about 3 days.,"First of all, why do people review games and give 5 stars months before a game is released? Some reviewers haven't even played a demo.Anyway, I am a big Sid Meier/Will Wright fan and always expect great games from them. This game is average at best. This game is graphically pleasing, but there is no depth. At first I was surprised at how little documentation came with this game. The manual is tiny. However, I think it is because the game is so 1 dimensional.Yes, you can design a golf course and tend to a limited number of your sim golfers' needs. But, where is the replayability? Am I going to want to play this game again so I can have a 3rd hole with a dog leg left instead of a dog leg right? I don't think so. I guess I expected more strategy; something I could sink my teeth into.Very disappointing."
5,Don't mistake it for a lousy tycoon game,"Though I have only played the demo, I can safely say SimGolf is a great game! You get to design a golf course and put in all kinds of landscaping and buildings. You actually get to keep up with a golfer and allow him to play tournaments. It takes a page from the Sims by having the same personality system and that you can golf with your Sims, I think. This is a very fun and addictive game!"
3,Promising but too easy,"The game starts out where you need to conserve money and build your holes just right. But after you've made three holes the money starts to pour in and you can make any kind of hole and people will love it. Way too easy. The most annoying part of the game is that you constantly have to wait for the county commisioner to come and allow you to buy land. The waiting gets tedious when you have no room to build, and therefore nothing to do. The game starts out well but quickly becomes a tedious bore, fun but boring."
3,A true review,"I'm seeing those who are bashing and those who are praising.So I'll direct my review at both views.Pros:You get to build your own golf courseYou can play on your creationYou can hold tournaments""Mini"" RPG (You can improve your shots)Cons:Can get boring fastCatch phrases get oldYou can only build 18 holes, so there is a maximum capacityMy recommendation:It's a Tycoon game, so if you don't like them, then you won't like this one.I gave this game a 5 star fun rating, because it is quite fun to play. Though if you aren't willing to spend the money, then don't complain about it."
3,JUST OK,THE CD WAS JUST OK AND NOT GOOD OR GREAT. IT WAS A CD TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE RISING GOSPEL MUSIC BUSINESS. TO ITS CREDIT IT DID SHOWCASE THE SMOOTH VOICE OF BILL PINKNEY.
5,Perfect Fit,These ventshades went on easily and work as intended. I am so pleased with the rain protection and the cosmetic looks.
4,THEY CUT IT OUT!,"This is a fabulous movie. I bawled like a baby when I saw iton TV, then eagerly awaited the video release. So you can imagine myabsolute astonishment when I realized that they had cut out a ton of scenes. I mean, you can still understand the movie and everything, but it is not as good, nor as powerful as the original version... But still, it is a movie worth watching, and is actually accurate, a rare thing for movies these days. END"
4,I used this film as a background for a lesson in general church history and found it holds the interest of young and old.,I used it for background for the study of general church history. It showed the relation of church and state and how both used each other for gain. It also showed how one person no matter age or station or sex can make a difference in the path of history. It also showed how the rise of nationalism set the stage for the reformation.It held the attention of the audiance both young and old and raised the questions that we wanted emphasized. Over all it was both good for entertainment value as well as the use which I made of it.
2,My video player did not paly this DVD,"I wanted to have Joan of Arc DVD disc, but Amazon.com is not kind enough to mention that our country has different system for play back from the USA. Our country has PAL system. I could not see this DVD with my video player. Always check your country video system before you buy."
5,Great movie,This is a fantastic movie! I thoroughly enjoyed it! Has a wonderful cast and Charlotte Church did a fabulous job on the vocals. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
2,I prefer...,This movie was ok. I do prefer The Messenger starring Milla Jovovich. Milla is exceptional in that version.
1,A Joan without edge...,"...a too sweet Joan, an unconvincing Joan, a boring Joan. The flames were too long in coming."
1,AAAaaahhhhh,"The worst Crusader movie ever made. Yikes. LeeLee Sobieski's screaming, invincibility was not only not believable, but downright silly. She is beaten, shot w/ arrows and thrown from turrets yet she screams on. I am in shock at the 'positive' reviews I've read here - clearly the same people that enjoy the acting of Ally McBeal or Friends.Stay away from this movie if you value your time!"
1,it efficiently put me to sleep,joan of arc tv movie was a big disappointment. they made her seem like an imputent little child. she never tried to go for what she wanted but what she did was god acting in her done out of pure love for God. she felt totally free to advide that jerk of a king how behave like a king.
1,French garbage,"This review may sound pretentious and ignorant, but in truth I'm a big fan of British history, so bear with me!Even as a film itself, it's surreal, and I don't like the acting. But as with any historical film that includes the British, they're made out to be the absolute bad guys! Sure we were forging an empire within France (i.e. The Hundred Years War), but rapists and murdering pillagers!? Never!Historically accurate, full of British sentiment, and down-right weird. Avoid this film today, folks!"
3,Buy it for the music score if nothing else,"Most TV movies are terrible, but this one was an exception. However, it was far from perfect. The basic story was there, but it lacked some details, and it needed more gritty reality in the battle scenes. I really liked Leelee as Joan, and the directors certainly made her out to be more demure and confused than the Joan in ""The Messenger."" What really stood out for me though was Charlotte Church's voice as the backdrop for the dramatic scenes. She is a perfect fit for this story. I am a big fan of Joan of Arc, so any movie about her is a welcome event, and I like the fact that each one takes its own view of what Joan was really like. She is still a mystery and I think that is the way it should be."
5,I love this movie!,"I love this movie so much. I watched it in seventh grade for my Social Studies class. My friends and I enjoyed it so much. We were all crying at the end when they burned her at the stake. Even the guys in our class seemed moved by it. The only complaints I have heard about the movie was that they didn't like how Joan acted, and they thought that she made bad decisions. Well I have news for you. The movie is a true story, they can't change the way she acted. I thought Leelee Sobeski did an awesome job. All in all, I loved this movie. It is my favorite movie of all time."
2,merc,This video lacks acting skills through out with just a few exceptions.I was not impressed with the movie at all. More like child play with a lot of fluff added.Disappointing would my depiction.
2,a soft Joan D'arc and poor acting,"As everybody, I saw both Joan D'arc and the Messenger from Besson and I was disappointed not only from the poor acting of the movie (Where are the flamboyant La Hire,Dunois and D'alancon who are so well depicted in the Besson Movie) but also on the too soft and spiritless Joan D'arc. Historical description of Joan D'arc are quite precise on this particular point : Joan was an exalted and fanatical women not the pleasant and delicate women that this movie wants us to believe. From this point, I can only say that the Messenger from Besson remains far ahead of this movie not only because it is more accurate but also because of the superb acting."
1,Abridged version,This movie was only 90 minutes long. Many scenes missing. Purchased to use in classroom setting. Now I have to search for the real thing. Students very dissappointed.
5,Great Movie! Love Leelee!,"This is a great movie! A percect edition to any persons collection! I love Leelee as Joan of Arc! Even though this movie is a bit inaccurate, it is still very good!"
2,"The good, the bad, but nothing ugly","This is one of the better Joan of Arc movies. Yeah, Leelee does look the part, but, at times, her acting is flat, at other times, really good. The historical inaccuracies are bothersome: Baudricourt's hens did not stop laying eggs until he gave Joan a letter of introduction; Joan did not willingly let herself ride off with the Burgundians; Bishop Cauchon was not at Chinon, Joan never returned home after she met Baudricourt, and there are others. I felt the best actor was Peter Strauss, followed closely by O'Toole. Yes, it's worth seeing again. However, to know more about what really happened, one should not get their history homework from movies. Start reading."
1,Joan of Arc (1999) Sobieski,"Visually this movie is pleasing; it is also a respectful handling of the subject. Historically and in other details, it is woefully inaccurate. For the ""real deal"" read the transcripts of her trials, which are available in their entirety, or Mark Twain's ""Joan of Arc"" for a condensed, but wholly accurate shorter version. Will no one go to the trouble to make a full, accurate telling of this saint's life on film?!!!"
1,The DVD that I bought did not have the full ending of the movie is not the full movie.,"The seller that I bought the movie from sent me Joan of Arc with LeeLee Sobieski. It did not have the full ending of the move, because I saw it before. Beaware of this. You will get, depending on what DVD is sent, not the full movie.Joan of Arc"
5,A realistic portrayal of a Christian giant,"It's very difficult, when looking at Joan of Arc, to separate the truth from the hundreds of myths, but this portrayal by LeeLee Sobieski is as close as we can get. Some things were left out, particularly in the trial, but a brilliant work nonetheless. While Joan would be a fairly easy character to portray, Sobieski plays the part with such a passion and fire that Joan literally comes to life again. Truly tremendous stuff that keeps the central focus of Joan's life in the foreground continually."
2,Ughh..........,"God, when I first purchased this movie I though it would be really good since it is about Joan of Arc which I am a huge fan of.What really bugged me about this movie was how they made it seem so easy for Joan to get the approval of everybody. Like to convince the people that she is on a quest to save Dauphin Charles and France. Yeah right, it took more than a few days to convince.I like the other Joan of Arc movie much better which is titled as ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"""
3,"Inspirational, But Fantasy","My apologies, but Medieval History is my academic field and I am a bit of a stick in the mud about historicity. This version of the Joan of Arc tale is quite entertaining and watchable, don't get me wrong. But my fingers were turning into vices against my couch pillows at the sacrifice of historical accuracy for ""a good story"". The big dramatic panorama of Joan's execution in a snowfall, for example, is poignant but wrong--Joan was executed in May, 1431, so snow would have been unlikely. This version is also perpetrating an idea of Joan which according to historical accounts is inaccurate. She wasn't some calm, kind, cool-headed individual, but rather an uneducated peasant girl maniacally spurred on by her fanatical devotion. For what I believe is a more authentic treatment, try The Messenger."
5,Incredibly Well Done - SEE THIS MOVIE,"If you were disappointed by The Messenger (or even if you weren't), you should see this movie. In my humble opinion, it is more likely a closer portrayal to Joan as she was. It doesn't have to stoop to vulgarity or a rape scene (of her sister, which isn't historical). Her visions are more accurately done (Joan never claimed to have seen Christ, as the Messenger would have one believe). How she came upon the sword of St. Catherine is also more accurate (The Messenger has her find it in a field, and never claims it was a relic). Finally, this movie shows more reverence to the sainthood of Joan, and as one other reviewer here stated, doesn't portray her as a psychotic. I cannot recommend this DVD enough."
5,Excellent!,This movie is excellent! Leelee and all the other actors did a wonderful job. I hope the stories of other CATHOLIC SAINTS are eventually raised to the limelight and told.
3,unique plot,"I was excited by this book when I first read about it. The plot sounded so unique that I jumped at a chance to get it. It took me a while to get into it though and even though I enjoyed it I was looking for more humor and passion. There are several scenes that could have been hilariously funny and only got a mild chuckle out of me.The plot line has the hero, J.T., coming home to find out what his nutty professor father is up to now. He stumbles into his fathers lab and POOF! He's now invisible. Now his father's assistant is a beautiful woman named Roselyn. Roselyn has a interesting past herself which introduces us to her unique family. Roselyn, J.T. and his father must find the solution to make J.T. visible and also catch a bad guy in the process.This book has some excitement and is cute at times. I found the book enjoyable but I was hoping for more from it."
3,Display stop it,It's a nice watch but i owned for 2 month and then the display stop it in 44 seconds... it may be the battery i think... bad battery...
3,"Flawed, but a decent book anyway","I have to admit that I agree with the shortcomings other reviewers have pointed out. It's overly long and much of the conversation could have been shortened to improve the pace and the mystery is easily solved by the middle of the book, but I still enjoyed visiting Charlotte and Thomas, I still enjoyed the setting and the other characters. It's enjoyable if you skim through the dull parts, really, reading the first sentence of every paragraph or something like that. Not great, but not too bad either."
3,Cut 100 pages!,"Although the details of Victorian society were interesting, I found that the characters kept repeating themselves; rambling speeches that went on way too long without adding anything to the progression of the plot or introducing any new information. Also, I think many readers will be able to figure out who the culprit is - it becomes fairly obvious at the end."
1,The answer's obvious half-way through the book.,"Perry's been one of my favorites in the past, but lately I'm finding her preachy and the puzzle not especially puzzling. I figured out who and why midway through the book, and was bored enough to look at the end and confirm that I was correct. I quit reading it then.The last book of hers I read, I also figured out, though I read the whole thing anyway. This one just wasn't worth the effort. Pity."
4,Kept me glued.,"A twisting story line and beautiful cinematography. Confused and confusing characters.Last shot will have you re-think the whole movie and explains the choppy, sometimes inconsistent, narrative and players.Something different. Loved it. Give it a shot."
2,SOPHOMORIC SLUMP FOR KITANO: HE DID MUCH BETTER LATER ON...,"THIS IS THE ULTIMATE 'SNAIL'S PACE' MOVIE. IT IS VERRRRRRRRRRRRY SLOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWW! YEP, I DID GROW IMPATIENT AFTER ALMOST AN HOUR UNTIL KITANO FINALLY SHOWS UP. THERE ARE MOMENTS OF HUMOR WHEN HE DOES ARRIVE BUT THE FIRST HOUR WAS UGH! THERE'S NOT EVEN A MUSIC SCORE HERE. NOT EVEN THE CLOSING CREDITS HAS ONE! IT'S A SEAT SQUIRMER."
1,Not a good movie...,"I am a big fan of Japanese and Hong Kong movies. This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I actually stopped watching it after an hour (if you find scenes of someone walking silently for two minutes interesting this is for you!)Try ""Made in Hong Kong"" instead - an excellent film."
4,Recomendable,Me gustó porque te dice claramente lo que puedes hacer y como llevarlo a cabo.El autor es muy ameno en su forma de escribir y muy positivo.
5,U2 Piano Book,LOVE LOVE this book. Hopefully in time I will be able to play all the songs. Good selection of songs in the book too.
4,Diz the wiz,"I attended this concert in 1982 and it was both electrifying and memorable. No superlatives are really necessary when describing these masters and sadly most are now gone. My only problems with this DVD release are that all of the music performed on that great evening is not presented here and that the tape pitch wavers a great deal. Most noticeably on Bags feature of Lover Man. It also saps the power and impact of John Lewis beautiful touch on the piano. In addition the audio and video are out of sync in several spots. I very much recommend this DVD due to the fact that you have Diz, Max, Bags and John Lewis on the same stage. Hopefully some day soon this will re-released with the care and content which it deserves. All in all there is much great music and humor here which simply exuded from the great John Birks ""Dizzy"" Gillespie."
4,Cute keychain,"I bought this keychain as a gift for Christmas. I liked that it was made in America and pewter; however, there was a little discoloration on the silver on the back. Or maybe it's supposed to look aged?"
2,Diccionario confuso,"Solo la portada se ve bien pero los significados son simples y palabras que podrian confundir al expresarse y ni llega a las 600 paginas,tampoco tiene antonimos y sinonimos y en realidad este diccionario es pobre,para lo que iba a pagar por este diccionario insignificante muchisimo dinero ,no se merece este precio de 150 dolares mas impuesto, deberia costar menos de $40.00 en total porque es muy simple y para colmo muy confuso,yo tuve que devolver este producto para lo que cuesta porque tambien llego medio usado y maltratado,debe haber otros diccionarios mucho mejor que este y con precios comodos y agradables."
4,"Gentle organic body wash, not my favorite scent","This product is gentle and safe for my skin, but I like the scent of cucumber song better."
2,Could have been worse--I think,How on earth did they ever convince Myrna Loy that this movie would be a good career move? Was she desperate for money? Oh well...even a lameass script and Suzanne Somers weren't enough to tarnish her elegance so no harm done. The one star over the required one is just for her.
3,"It ain't Shakespeare, or even Sci-Fi channel productions, but bought it for a dollar and so i'll give it a break","First off Suzanne Somers is in this one for about 5 min. total(most of it in a bed sheet) so don't think she's the star, Robert Foxworth is and as cheap horror movies for T.V. go(1977) this isn't that bad. You get what you pay for though(if you pay over 2.00 dollars ,you've payed too much) so sit back and watch ants wipe out a resort."
5,Very helpful and easily implemented ideas.,"I certainly see Dr. Ginott's influence on many of the popular theorists on child rearing today. He teaches, with easily understood examples, an alternative to the ""verbal spankings"" many of us have been ineffectually doling out for years. It is a shame that these three books are out of print."
1,got the wrong ones,"terrible store. i purchased the custom light (9-46), they sent the regular light (10-46). besides, it took over 9 days to be delivered. terrible experience. luckly, I use this gauge on other guitars. the string tone and durability beyond comparison."
3,Needs some modification,"I lije the way the hitch looks on the truck, but there were some problems with installation that could be easily solved by the manufacturer. The holes for the secondary bolts are too far forward on the bumper and would have caused me to drill through the bumper where it turns up toward the license plates; so I elected to delete them. I will only be towing a light trailor, so that should be fine. Also, the large bolts are much too long and I had to cut them off (no easy feat!) to allow the pin to go in to hold the ball insert. I think shorter main bolts and move the secondary holes slightly to the rear would be a big help."
2,"Anne Taintor magnet: ""a real friend...""","The magnet I received was not what was pictured under this listing. The one I received says ""if looks could kill women wouldn't need frying pans"" but the one in the listing says ""a real friend will help you hide the body."" Very disappointed. I'd be happy to remove my review if the problem is fixed in the listing and in my order."
4,Funny and functional...,"The magnet arrived in a protective plastic sleeve. Its size is about that of a square drink coaster, and is thin and flexible. The image is very well printed on the surface and the magnet, which compromises the entire back surface, has very good adhesion to the fridge. When stuck on something, the magnet is nearly flush with the surface. It made a great gift and the quality was very good. It won't be the very best magnet you've ever owned, but it will be the funniest! Recommended."
1,Beware buying this online,"First, this is not a review of the book in question, I have yet to receive it, though I've tried to purchase it twice. Be careful when ordering this book online through sellers that use ISBNs to track and sell books. This book shares an ISBN with a Silhouette Special Edition of a book titled ""Reach out to Cherish,"" which I've received on both occasions when I tried to order this particular book. So please, be aware when purchasing through Amazon or any other online vendor where you don't see the actual item being sold that you may not get what you expected."
4,Family Resource Management book review,This book describes a theory of family resource use in the context of traditional family systems theory. Most of the book is written on a very basic level making the content a good introduction for those not familiar with systems theory.
2,Rest on your laurels...,"Weak, uninteresting suspense novella that reads more like a long, corny treatment for an episode of NIGHT GALLERY. This author's work is so extensive and groundbreaking that this slim volume can only succeed in disappointing his many old fans...and alienating any new ones.Avoid this one and look into his classic past work."
1,I have not received the product that I ordered.,"As I have stated above, to this date, I have not received the product that I ordered, but have been charged. Please look into this for me. Thank You, Dolores Barthuly"
2,Republican History of Northern Irish Troubles in a novel,"West Belfast is a book of the rise of a young man from street-fighting to full-scale terrorism. If you are interested in a very, very biased Republican (i.e. Sinn Fein) view of the beginning of the troubles, buy this book from a well-known, once convicted Sinn Fein spokesperson. For a much better novel with a similar scope (but less republican, more catholic) buy Maddens One by One in the Darkness. If you want to read the ultimate novel on Northern Ireland, read McLiam Wilsons Eureka Street."
3,copy,this was a copy someone burned and sold. the quality wasn't very good but it was as good or better than when it was originally released.
5,Great dvd,Very good picture and sound quality from a classic movie that only a hardcore biker or wannabe would enjoy totally.
3,Easy Rider,A dated movie from the late sixties.The acting was poor and not well written as well as produce.Save your money.
4,easy rider dvd,"bought it as a gift for my boyfriend. arrived as described, in a timely fashion. little wear. boyfriend loved it."
1,Slow-moving and boring,"Easy Rider's reputation as a classic doesn't resonate with me. Simply put, the film is boring. Most of it is little more than endless shots of the cast riding their motorcyles, and equally endless scenics rolling by. There isn't much dialogue, and each scene is very disconnected from the next. We get hardly any sense of who the characters are and why they are acting the way they are. Different themes in the film - freedom, prejudice, community, and hypocrisy - are tossed around aimlessly, with no sense of cohesion, making the viewer wonder just what the film's point is (when he isn't yawning). A classic it may be to some viewers, but to this one it is just a giant snooze."
1,The Most Overated Film in History,"I first saw this film when it was released in 1969 and thought the critics of the day had gone collectively mad. Everyone in the entire film, whether it's ""heroes"" Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper or their antagonists, are annoying. Jack Nicholson is the only one that attempts to create a character out of his role. There is no story and theneverending vignettes are pointless and/or pretentious. The script, if there was one, consists of Dennis Hopper saying ""man"" every fifteen seconds.This film was dated when it was released. Today, it's laughable."
4,"Haiku review: trippy and hippy, but definitely essential viewing -- captures the late '60s American mood like no other film","American dreamsDrugs, cash, girls -- an endless highwayIt's true, we blew it"
4,1969,"The episodic plot concerns two motorcyclists who take their profits from a drugs deal to head for the New Orleans Mardi Gras. In the course of their odyssey across America, they encounter frequent backwoods intolerance........The film's lasting effect made a star out of Nicholson, who won an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of an aimless lawyer making his first experience with drugs. An offbeat, low-budget ROAD MOVIE that has become a cult film by capturing the restless hedonism of the hippie era. The film's surprise success insipired a wave of youth-culture movies, few of which are now remembered; although the big studios attempted to imitate EASY RIDER'S casual technique and rebellious attitudes, its impact has never been equaled. The film cost only $375,000 to make and it grossed a whopping TWENTY MILLION at the box-office."
5,One of the greatest American films ever made!,"I can't acknowledge my admiration of this movie enough. To me this is American Cinema at its finest.If you like stories about freedom this is for you. To paraphrase Jack Nicholson 'Lots of people like to talk about freedom but they don't want anybody living it'. Its a sometimes surreal adventure, but it makes its points well.The wide screen version enhances the, already superb, cinematography.I give this film my highest recomendation."
3,So Bad it's good,This film should be purchased to play in the background at parties. It is a strange fantasy film with some good music. Terrible acting and as far from reality as you could get. But for some reason I like the film.
1,"""Man, I'm trippin' out; somebody shoot me!""","From the bizarre editing to the lame dialogue, from the horrible sound track (before my time!) to the glorification of drug use--of which I definitely do not approve--I can easily say that ""Easy Rider"" is among the five WORST films I have ever seen in my life! The American Film Institute includes this bomb in its list of 100 greatest American films, so I thought I'd check it out. This film is so bad that I can't even think of four other films to insult by including them in the same list. Sad to say, but by the end of the film, I was actually rooting for the rednecks--and wasn't disappointed!"
3,Unique when new but dull for today's audience,"I was 11 years old when this came out. So of course I heard a lot about it but didn't see this movie. So when I had a chance to watch it I decided to see what the fuss was about. Well, considering the times it was made, it was a radical departure from the norm. Nudity, pot smoking and perhaps other no-nos of that period.The story is kinda boring. Two motorcycle enthusiasts take a trip to New Orleans to go to Mardi Gras. There is tragedy because of prejudice and so there is a sad quality to this film. Still, it's not a great movie just ahead of it's time...maybe. Plus it introduced the great actor Jack Nicholson."
5,Easy Rider Review,The movie came in very good condition. It is a very great movie to watch. I love the motorcycles and freedom. I want to do that as well!
2,painfully hilarious 60's drivel,"I watched this the second time in film class in 1970 with a professor who claimed to have watched it 40+ times, teasing out the deeper nuances. That seemed excessive even given the zeitgeist of the times. Watching it once would be excessive now but for the insight it gives into the completely vacuous values of the 60's. Some aspects of the 60's have held up well (Jimi Hendrix still sounds great), but this movie isn't one of them. If you can listen to Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper babble with the other stoners on the commune about doing your own thing in your own time without bursting out laughing, you need more drugs. I would give this one star but for the fact that the music is pretty good, it helped launch Jack Nicholson, and Fonda has gone on to do some very good movies and Hopper some great ones."
4,easy - but not to forget!,"Easy Rider is one of those movies that lurks somewhere in your past like the slap of an abusive parent! Where living for the moment become an obsession, your life's work! Of course you know the end is just around that corner! When the ""Vacancy"" sign will be turned off in your face for the last time!"
3,EASY RIDER,"Yesterday I have finaly had the chance to see the british special edition of Easy Rider. I was realy excited to receive it, not to mention the expectations of a claimed 1 1/2 hours extra footage with never seen before scenes. Wow. What dissapointment! The entire 2nd disc with the documentary didn't have a single minute extra footage from Easy Rider!It's a big bogus.Thanks for nothing!"
4,Great memories brought back with the Blu-Ray 40th East Rider Anniversary,"It is great to have the classic Easy Rider now on Blu-Ray. The enhanced picture and sound quality really makes this movie a collector's choice if you are from that era. 40 years ago, I saw the Easy Rider movie in a Drive-In Theater on my Triumph motorcycle ! What a great memory! Now I watch it on our 106"" Home Theater, and my Harley is parked in the garage!"
1,Easy Rider,I really was not impressed with this movie. It had some funny parts but was very drawn out. The acting was good just boring.
4,Easy Rider DVD,I got this video for a chinese gift exchange for my motorcycle riding group. I thought it would be a great laugh (most of us were young adults when this movie came out) along with some hot chocolate and pop corn. Who know's it may be the most popular gift to exchange!
5,Great Movie!,I loved everything about this movie. The sequal is being made by Miracle Entertainment (mvee). Look for it next year.
1,Wish I could give it a 1/4 star,"I just finished watching this loser movie....I'm curious...in whatever warped need that Dennis Hopper had to produce a counterculture film,,why did the film need to be so incredibly boring...Hoppers' character was negative, and frankly he never shut up......totally annoying,,,,their death at the end was pointless, just like the entire film...I get the point of the film....regardless...I want my two hours back...."
1,"90% snore, 10% interesting","Well, it may have been representative of its day, but as of 12/27/05, it's grown pretty tedious. It has one thing to say, that could be said in about 10 minutes, but it spreads the ""message"" out over way too long. The ending is truly shocking, and somewhat redeems the tedium of the earlier parts of the film that tend to drag, drag, drag. Jack Nicholson is, of course, the bright spot in the film, but he's in waaaaay to little of it."
3,Why not like the British?,"The specificiations listed say there's the soundtrack and this 80 page booklet. How poor. Check out the british Edition to come. The REgion 2 edition will have great packaging, the same booklet, but instead of just the soundtrack, it will include a new master of the film and the documentary ""easy riders, raging bulls"", which is also avaible as a paperback novel best seller by Biskind.so I still hope this version will be updated with that documentary in a great package, otherwise we true fans just have to pick the British DVD"
2,OVERRATED!,"Can somebody please explain to me how this awful movie became one of the signature movies of a generation? Did this movie come out during a lull in full-length film productions? Were there no other movies that had a decent story or camera work? The cameraman appears to have seveal seizures during the filming, and apparently, Dennis Hopper was too strung out on coke to realize this during the editing process. Also there appears to be a huge gap in the plot line--a lack of decent ideas and dialogue that doesn't make me laugh at it's pathetic attempt to be hip and/or serious. There are only two things good about this movie: the soundtrack and the fact that this movie propelled Jack Nickolson's career. Other than that, this movie should be burnt, or at least end up like the main characters do.Hippie Pete"
1,Easy Rider,"Overrated,boring and long,It stars Two Pseudo-Commie And Poseur Actors:Fonda and Nicholson(Hopper is good though).The movie does not represent True Bikers. Bikers Are not Hippies,They Are Tough,they were TRUE Counter-Culture,Realists And Reactionary like myself. Sure There are bad apples and racists, but it isn't liberal fascist like most hippies. The best Biker Film is Hells Angels 69' and it actually has them in it!"
1,guess you have to be stoned...,"I don't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained. I don't seek to psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique, it's only a movie. I either enjoy it or I don't. I did NOT enjoy this, and I ride, so I assumed I would like this. I guess you have to ride AND use drugs to appreciate this...."
3,A classic but it doesn't hold up over time..,"As good as Easy Rider is, it is not the type of movie that is going to pull in younger crowds.. The message of peacefulness and community with its underlying criticism of those who take this concept to brain-dead stages is one that stands the test of time.Unfortunately, the mechanics of the movie itself simply do not. Nicholson, Hopper and Fonda all give great performances. However, this movie is always going to appeal more to the peace and flower power crowd than the [chemical] genre crowd.. For the latter, this movie simply cannot compete with Trainspotting, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, etc.."
4,"Easy Rider, timeless movie made better on DVD","The picture and sound quality of the DVD transfer are very high quality, and the special features on the disk make what was already a good movie even more enjoyable and much more meaningful.There are modern day interviews with most everyone in and involved with the making of the film that offers a lot of insight into the symbolism, and the day to day occourance of what went into making the film, as well as the mind set of those involved at the time.Highly recomended !"
3,It Has An Audience,"I did not love this movie to death but did not dislike it intently either. Sort of middle of the road. I actually like Jack Nicolson's character. Easily the least sleazy between him, Fonda, and Hopper ...Truthfully the story line is quite annoying. The ... haze isn't really my style but I wanted to see what all the hype was about. Liked the scenery of the guys riding through America. The film sets a mood for the 60's biker ... culture and I can relate to what its trying to say.People who grew up in the sixties or who can related to the ... counterculture will like this film. Nonetheless, I cannot agree that Easy Rider is the universal all time classic that it is reverred as by all these film societies."
5,A TRUE CLASSIC ABOUT FREEDOM!,"Watching this movie, and reading a book called ""RIch Dad, Poor Dad"", you learn that that people would rather sit and talk about freedom without actually doing it! I saw this movie in 1985 at the age of 7, but could not get it. I watched this again last summer and the point I understood was ""People are jealous of free people, but they are too scared to steer away from the crowd to pursue their goals in life"". Like Nicholson said, ""Talking about being free and actually doing it are two different things. You tell some people they ain't free...they're gonna kill you"". So, if you have not seen this you should. Also go buy two books called, ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" and ""Cashflow Quadrant"" by Robert Kiyosaki. Put the movie and the books together and you'll understand the combination of freedom, money and psychology all in one!"
5,Beyond Redemption,This is a nasty film that portrays the dark inner recesses of the human existence behind the walls of Denmark's former notorious maximum security prison. Everything shown here reduces humanity to the vicious instinctual level of dog-eat-dog world where nobody but the very lucky survive. I found this movie to be a fascinating study on a number of levels: its use of ex-cons as actors; its portrayal of how the prison hierarchy works; the culture of corruption that pervades every corner of the prison; the different monikers like 'Rune' and 'Albanian' that various inmates adopted to established their reputation; and the many psychological cat-and-mouse games being played out between predator and prey. This film is so caught up in describing the terrifying realities of prison life that it does not need a Hollywood-style plot to reinforce. Actions definitely speak louder than words in this modern Dostoevskian depiction of human depravity in its most hopeless state.
1,I thought it was BORING,I thought this was probally one of the most boring books I have ever read. It was written in English form and I thought it was hard to undrestand what they were trying to say.
2,I didn't like it,"W. Kaplan ""calyndula""'s review makes this book sound like a classic. And it is. It's an old story and alot of people like it. But just because something's labeled 'classic', doesn't mean it's always interesting and simply wonderful. Do not be fooled, I love horses and horse books, it's just that this one, put quite simply, is one big yawn. It is often sold with a gold chain with the ""Pie"" on it. The chain isn't even worth the price: No matter how gentle you are with it, it will eventually break. Until the 15th chapter, there's no excitement, no cliffhangers...not even any tragedies for pete's sake! Just a bunch of silly nonsense and 'classic' dumb 'english' language. It's VERY confusing and hard to understand. I mean, I don't mind some good old-style language, but for heaven's sake! I may sound like an overly critical old-style book hater, but I'm not. The movie was better. I'm just saying this book doesn't deserve 16 chapters. That's my two cents, take it or leave it."
4,A good book,"I thought this book was good. But the reason i gave it 4*, is because the story isn't really origional if you think about it. It is a classic story of girls trying to do somthing that they love and overcome thier obticles. The book is about a girl named Velvet. Velvet loves to ride and race horses; however, no girls are allowed. So she cuts her hair and shows people what she is made of. To find out how it ends, you have to read it. If you like these kinds of books, you'll definatly like this book. But if your like me (not really into corny stuff) then you'll think it's ok."
1,Not your typical horse story . . .,". . . and not trying to be. As a horse-crazy 11 year old, I read every horse book in the library. This was my least favourite. I remember being very disappointed and bored. If you're looking for a classic English horse story, try Black Beauty."
5,An excellent book on the courage of one child's dream!,"National Velvet is a natural treasure. It shows the courage and in the innocense of children to believe that things can happen. My, if adults only listen to their hearts more than they do the polls, the world would be a better place. In spite of others had to say, Velvet believe that it could happen. I plan to rent the video to view Elizabeth Taylor's magnificent performance. This is a treasure for both men and women. Every body should read it. Kudos"
3,John Smith and Pocahontas,"This is not a very informative book. The subjects are brief. The information leaves lots of parts of their life story. Overall, the book was okay."
4,coffee could be stronger. taste is good,Good servive. faor price. this coffee could be a bit stronger to my taste
4,Kenya Blend For Strong Coffee Lovers,"This blend lives up to its description of dark, robust and strong.It has a slight bitter aftertaste that makes me want to go one or two blends ""lighter"", but will appeal to those seeking their classic morning beverage "" strong and jolting""."
5,Senseo coffee pods,I've been using Senseo coffee pods ever since the Senseo coffee maker was available. I like the coffee because it's Douwe Egberts. So I wake up every morning to watch the sun rise and have me a robust cuo of Douwe Egberts Kenya or Espresso!Nathan Simmons
3,Coffee pods not on par with fresh ground beans.,"Coffee is o.k., but I would not rate it as gourmet. Maybe I'm just used to gourmet beans."
5,Addictive!!,"Subscribed to the variety pack - great deal! Love to wake up with a cup of the kenya variety, looking forward to come home to a cup of the sumatra. Contemplating getting a senseo machine at work, but that would be to addictive, plus I might have to share!!"
4,"Nothing special, but works","Good coffee. Mild tasting. Nice to have for a change.I like being able to buy the Kenyan and Brazilian for a change. All the others; mild, dark, decaf, sumatra are good too, but I can buy them in the store for the same price or less (and can use coupons).I also think Maxwell House is a pretty good competitor.I buy this coffee through amazon for the convenience."
2,Too Mild and sweet,"I have been an avid senseo fan for about a year. However, I was getting a bit bored drinking the same Dark Roast every morning (I found the other flavors too mild). So I was very happy when I saw the new flavors (Sumatra, Colombia, Kenya and Brazil). Sumatra and Columbia are the two that I liked. I found the Kenya blend to be mild and sweet. Even my wife, who previously used Hazelnut did not like it too much."
4,Good bold flavour,"I tried the other flavor -- Brazilian, Columbia and Sumatra, they are all too weak for my taste. Seems like the Kenya Blend is a bit stronger."
3,Substantially better than the 'standard' Senseo pods,"Senseo pods always have an amount of coffee close to the minimum acceptable. These are no exception. That being said, this coffee is substantially better than the Douve Egberts medium or dark roast Senseo pods. A little darker roast than the medium, but with no bitter flavor. If I didn't like the new Sumatran blend even better, I'd be using these almost exclusively from now on. As it is, they'll provide a occasional change of taste, but no loss of quality."
5,Love this coffee,I am slowly trying all of the Senseco coffee flavors. Love this one and dark roast. I do not normally go for the darker coffees. These are NOT too strong.
5,Great coffee,"Smells great! Now i just have to get the Juan Valdez coffee maker t work.. if not, I'm getting a senseo!"
3,There are better pods out there,"The Senseo Douwe Egberts machine is great and will produce a superb cup of coffee provided that one uses a pod made by Fratello, Timothy's or some other brand carried by Amazon. The Senseo Douwe Egberts pods simply do not contain enough coffee to make a full-bodied cup of coffee. The Kenya blend is not bad, but you can do better."
5,What my wife loves,I bought this product online because it wasn't available in retail outlets any longer. The price is too high. Service was as advertised.
5,Why get rid of your best product????,"Why the good folks at Ralph Lauren decided to get rid of their best product is beyond me. Maybe it wasn't a huge seller, maybe they just want to have a Polo only fragrance line. Who knows. Get it while you can. The price has skyrocketed for the few remaining bottles. Oh well. Their bad."
1,i havent recieved this item,"This review is to let you know that I Havent recieved this item. And The Reason That I Havent Called Or Contaced You Is Because I Didn't Print Out The Confirmation Number. And I Dont Have The Phone Number. If You Guys Wanna Call Me This Is My Number To Let You Guys Now, So Please Call Me.(909)936-3808"
5,Gift for Him or Me?!?,"This is my favorite cologne for men! He seems to like it as well, but I think I like it more than he does. The 3.4 oz size seems to last him close to a year, and I buy him a new bottle when he runs out as a gift for Christmas or his birthday. I sometimes feel guilty, as I think it is more of a gift for me than for him :)"
1,Inferior product received,"What we got was very disappointing. First of all, the bottle was an opened tester (labeled tester, did not have the black lid). And, when compared with a bottle bought at a local department store, the fragrance was clearly much weaker, as if the testers were diluted versions of the standard product. My father was seriously disappointed in what he received."
1,This really sucked!,"I bought the audio books because I enjoyed reading the actual books so much. It was a huge mistake. The guy who reads Jordan's work is terrible. He makes the work sound melodramatic and even does the various character's dialogue with lame accents. For instance, he uses a terrible Irish accent when speaking for Thom. How d***ed ridiculous can you get! I couldn't stomach listening to the whole thing it was so sickening. Don't waste your money on this garbage. Read the books for yourself and you'll be a whole lot more satisfied."
5,Woa,"Start as off by throwing you for a Bella loop and when you think you can't figure anything out, it stems you own your toes with shouts of 'I knew that would happen' with gleeful bliss.....(and breathe)"
5,"""The Wheel of Time"" rolls strongly ahead.","This book will be thoroughly enjoyed by any fan of fantasy writing. However, I would strongly recommend that readers should start from the beginning with book 1 ""The Eye of the World"". This book is a fast-paced fun read that will keep you immersed in a vivid and detailed world of fantasy. Robert Jordan writes so well as to make you feel that you are part of the story. Once you pick up the book you will not want to put it down. This book builds on the story of three boyhood friends who find themselves at the center of the struggle to save the world from the Dark one. Rand, Matt, and Perrin each have a significant portion of the book. After reading this, you will just want to get the next book as soon as you can."
5,Great storytelling,"Robert Jordan tells a great story. He makes the characters believable, and stays away from the ""superhero"". The characters have problems, hangups, egos, and all the other human frailties, so the reader can identify with them. A few times in this book, I found myself wishing he would get on with the plot, because he uses so much detail, as well as a lot of background information on his ""world"". I suppose this information is good for the reader not familiar with the Wheel of Time series, but by Book 3, it's time to just tell a great story!"
4,"Better Pace, More Action","After the plodding volume 2, ""The Dragon Reborn"" picks up the pace pushing you to the end where Rand becomes the Dragon. Jordan does get bogged down in details, he seems to want to flesh out every person in his world, whereas other authors may focus too much on their central characters. He probably could have done without one or two of the Tar Valon chapters. But the book moves the story along to the point you want to read the next book. But there are nine more books to go (not counting the final one not written and the prequels). That's a bit much for one story line, but when is all said and done, it will rank as one of the best fantasy epics ever, along with Tolkien, Lewis and Brooks."
2,Like A Bad Soap Opera,It goes on and on. This is where it ended for me. After slogging through book one and two and enjoying some good ideas with spots of good and bad writing - I just could not make it through here. Jordan is not discriminating enough for me in his deciding what to relate to the reader. For some the details and descriptions appear to be of enormous interest but I think the dragging out of the plot is unexcusable and lead me to drop this series even though I wanted to enjoy it..
5,The best you can read.,"I just love to read Robert Jordan's series ""The Wheel of Time"". It tells you about the different kinds of difficulties in the life of young men and women. The adventures they came accros are full of danger and magic, which reminds of J.R.R. Tolkin's books, but made of Jordan's own style. ""The Dragon Reborn"" makes you fill exited. It is a book for everybody who can read."
5,Tolkien Reborn!,"Perhaps not as good as the first, Jordan's Dragon Reborn still shines through as one of fantasy's finest literary achievements. While the writing is superb the story is better, and takes us along on waves of adventure and intrigue that is the core of fantasy. The importance of women is refreshing and almost unique in fantasy, which is an utterly male dominated genre of writing. Though Tolkien is still the father of all fantasy, Jordan shows a promise to keep the tradition of alternate realities alive and in our hearts."
1,Nothing is different,"This series is getting worse and worse. I handled the 1st one ok, but after the second I asked myself, ""didn't I just read this?"". All the books I have read by Jordan (five-got them as gifts) are just about a bunch of unlikable, shallow, and stupid characters wandering around, until something happens at the end of the book to set up the NEXT book. O, and that prose! How many people are ""stone-faced""? How many times are woman going to ""fold their arms under their breasts""? Why is everyone so sexist? Jordan also throws in mindless Trolloc attacks, seemingly to pad the book. Maybe he gets paid on a per word basis. This book has to be for a younger crowd."
1,Book is Good CD is BAD!,"First off the book is great. But my beef isn't with the writer it's with the audiobook publisher since they can't seem to put a complete book in their boxes. I've already returned this CD version of the book once (CD's wrongly labeled which means I didn't have a complete book), got the new one in today and the CD's aren't matching the disk labels again and they double packed disks 9-12.....come on people seriously...now I've got a second return to do knowing the incoming will be wrong as well (coming from the same inventory)...I cannot contact audiorenaissance (no number, web address invalid)."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Rand now has his mojo going on. Therefore, he thinks he has a shot at doing over one of the demon lord types.Along with Moraine, he travels to Tear, because, well, a magic sword never hurt anyone's credibility if you draw it in a big showy stunt and win a fight, even with help.This allows him to start establishing a serious political power base."
4,The Dragon Reborn,This book delivered as expected. It fit well within the series and was a good read. Looking forward to book 4.
3,Favorite book of the epic,"If you enjoy Jordan's style and can bear his repetitiveness, this book is for you. I throughly enjoyed it. If you've read the first two and liked them then keep going. However, if you felt like you had to push to finish the second book, quit now while you're ahead.I wouldn't recommend it for a tenth grade lit class, however. It's not quite challenging enough.It gets three stars because it is a pale reflection of Tolkien's masterpiece, Lord of the Rings"
5,stop ragging on these books,"i dont know whats wrong with all of you people, the wheel of time are the best series ive ever read and, im not trying to be arrogant but, thats saying something. The characterisation in these books is brilliant, the whole world is so intricate that as someone said earlier you are forced to become a participant in the story rather than an observer,and although ive read all of them several times they do not get stale. Robert Jordan is the best writer ever (no disrespect to any others mind you) and his books the best ever written. thank you for your time."
3,Long and Boring,"This is a long and boring book, and I really do not understand the interest in this series. The dialogue is flat, the characters either annoying and/or robotic, and there's very little tension in the plot. This is a book that just drags its feet, and doesn't seem to have any direction."
4,A complex but nonetheless great book,I agree the book was awesome and with all the characters intercatly drawn in. With unique ideas and a well written plot. The story is not surrounded by the main character in book number three but that is okay considering you have 6 other books which probably revolve around him. The only bad thing about the book is some of the errors and mistakes- grammer and such. Otherwise i agree its a great series. Who can blame a little faults for all that hardwork Jordan has put in?
5,Excellent!,"Excellent book. I couldn't put it down! I can't wait for book 9 to come out, even though I'm only on Book 4, The Shadow Rising. By the way, did you know that Robert Jordan is a pseudonym for James Oliver Rigney, Jr.?"
4,'Dragon Reborn' is a thrilling read.,"After reading the first three volumes of 'The Wheel of Time' books, this third volume is far and away the most well-written. I found myself hanging on every word with nearly 200 pages remaining. Jordan's prolific descriptive powers come through fully.Don't let recent reviewers (although he does make sense) throw you, this is a fascinating read. It reminds me of a recent 'Buffy' television series episode. It focuses on the supporting characters as they fulfill their tasks...giving a new and fresh perspective. Although it is odd to have the main character of the series (and the very subject of the title no less) virtually non-existent, this gives the book enough of a different feel to make it intriguing.Remember, some people live to criticize. Form your own opinions."
2,Finally WoT starts becoming more mature,"This book gets a great deal of criticism for leaving out the main character (and the character on the cover). This is not a failing of the novel or it's writer, on the contrary, it's what makes the novel brilliant. This is the first time Jordan really showcases his talent for narrative. In 'The Dragon Reborn' you have an entire story that is titled for, and written about, a character that grows and develops mostly off screen, leaving us to fill in the blanks of the dark paths tread, and trials endured by Rand al'Thor. His journey takes him from a mostly naive caricature of a farm boy to a very real adult character who may be slipping into madness. That said, the book still fails to grow its on screen characters. Some may say Mat evolves, but we've never had chapters written from his point of view until now, so I don't know if this counts.Book 4 is where the series begins to excel."
5,"Great book, great series",I thought the books would have to get less interesting as the series progressed but I have to say I've enjoyed every single book in the series to date. Definitely recommend.
5,The Wheel of Time Book 3 - The Dragon Reborn,"I waited for this book to be released when I was a teenager! I was so excited then, and I'm excited to reread it now! Jordan was a master storyteller! The adventure, the politics, the good vs. evil....pure imagery at it's finest! You will NOT be disappointed."
5,It still goes on strong.,"The author has kept the story going on strong without any signs of losing the plot's focus, which I believe is the number one priority to an on going series.I am glad he hadn't allowed himself to get sidetracked into any other priorities that concerns with this book and this series so far.With each main character's changing plots and events, the main story still goes on with more twists and uncertainty as the reader learns more about the unsolved and unanswered mysteries.What's more interesting is the way each characters develope, in main contrast to how they were before.Definitely a pleasant ride with new dangers that hadn't shown itselves before, and the continuation of the telling of the Prophecies of the Dragon."
3,Skip this part of the Wheel of Time world,"I was disappointed with the third installment of Wheel of Time. The story is not sophisticated enough especially when you consider the possibilities and the overall scope of the Wheel Of Time world. Most of the time you have 3 to 4 story threads (which is okay) but they are all very repetitive and not variedly enough. The entire story is about walking from inn to inn and a chase between the antagonist and the protagonist. This may be a simplified view of the story but it expresses how I bored I was. Even the title is somewhat misleading ""THE DRAGON REBORN"", Rand is the supposed Dragon Reborn, but he is hardly mentioned in this book at all. The second book of wheel of time ""THE GREAT HUNT"" was of top quality and a very enjoyable read, which makes installment three even more disappointing."
4,A good book for a cruise,"Read ""Dragon Reborn"" while on a cruise -- nice relaxing book to pass the time away with at the pool. Many people criticize that Rand is not in the book that much. I think that's a plus since most of the first two books dealt with him. I'm not at all crazy about him. Mat emerges as a very strong figure in the book as does Perrin and the girls. Too me its' sort of like ""The Two Towers."" I love the parts with Aragorn, Gimli etc and got quite bored with all of Frodo's wanderings.We learn more about the world of the characters. The Forsaken, The Black Ajah and the Aiel all take on larger roles.I thought there was much more action in this book than either of the first two which are the only ones I have read to date.I capped my review at a 4 because I'm not as excited about this ""world of Dreams"" that most of the characters experience in the book, especially the ""convenient"" ways it helps Egwene and Perrin later in the book.But I'm hooked and will order Book 4 in a few days!!!"
5,This book is GREAT,When I read book I was amazed. I think this book can show out above the rest in this world
4,This is it. Stop reading here.,"If you value your time and your money, I'd recommend you to stop reading this series at this point. The Wheel of Time was intended to be a trilogy, and the authors' decision of making it twelve books instead has certainly proved the be the downfall of this series. So why don't we read it as a trilogy? The end (no spoilers) leaves a lot of questions unanswered; however, it ends close to as it should have ended on the first place. Heed my advice, oh readers who have reached this far, for if you don't, you'll find yourself pretty soon damning the time you decided to continue reading this series after reading this review."
2,Wheres the Dragon???,"This is the third book in the Wheel of Time series. Jordan applies the same formula which he had used in the previous 2 books. The story keeps dragging on than suddenly in the last few pages, some action happens.I still dont know how the strongest fort of the world, the Stone of Tear, which cannot be break by any Army, is very easily taken by Rand and Co and some Aeil. The Dark one as usually visits Rand dreams, proposing Rand to join him and Rand rejects him.I'm mostly annoyed with the female characters who are always rude and full of ego's.Dont expect much with this book and the series"
2,This is where I get off!,"After just finishing The Dragon Reborn, I've decided to abandon this dreadful and apparently endless series. I am truly amazed at the rabid devotion of Jordan fans to The Wheel Of Time. Obviously a great number of people are mistaking quantity for quality. Comparisons to Tolkein, Shakespeare and FAULKNER are totally laughable. Jordan is a patently formuliac writer milking a profitable series for all it is worth."
4,Beginning to take on its own story,This book has left the confines of Tolkien and the story is beginning to take on an original and interesting identity of its own.
2,the last readable of the whole serie,"after this one, from the 4th ... it is just not worth the time.But even this one gegins to slow down.pages and pages of nothing, should have skipped 300 pages and jump straight to the end..."
2,"Can we get on with this, please?",The plot of the second book of this series seemed to be slowing down. That was nothing compared to this book. I'm getting tired of reading the endless whining. Someone ought to shove Rand off a cliff so the book can get moving again.
4,The best of the first three,"I welcomed the change of emphasis in this third book. I was glad to follow Perrin and Matt and learn more of them. Each of the three major characters is fascinating and this third book does reward the reader for following through the first two books. The manipulations of the Aes Sedai do become more complex, and the conflicts between the ajahs are well developed.I might groan a bit at the thought of seven more novels published with the promise, or is it a threat, of at least two more to come. However, so far, so good."
4,Really I rate it at 4 and 1/2 stars,There are only 2 things that bug me so far about this series. I can skip whole books and still get the story. I read this one before I read The Great Hunt (book 2). And the second thing is that THEY ARE TOO GOOD!!! I have so much trouble putting the books down to do other things that I'm supposed to be doing! These are really good stories and I'm glad that I finally decided to try reading them even though I don't normally read this kind of SciFi/Fantasy. Only if you have a lot of time to commit to reading should you dive into this series! Because you won't want to stop reading them until the end of the series!
4,Another great,"This book has gotten some bad reviews for no reasons, the central figure was not Rand entirely but we neede to get to no the others better anyway. All in all this is avery good book that has its rightful spot in Jordan's work. We get to know Perrin and Mat better and have some interesting knew plots develope. If you have read the first two you have to read this one!"
5,The Purest form of Contemporary Epic Fantasy,"The events surrounding this the third in Robert Jordan's ""Wheel of Time"" truly culminated in ""The Dragon Reborn."" Mr. Jordan not only emphasized an epic hero in Rand Al'Thor, but also allowed for much development in the supporting characters of Mat Cauthon and Perrin Aybara. If a person was to read this series, this book would be the ultimate representation of both Jordan's style and skill as a writer."
5,Still a great series after three. . .,"I found the third book of Jordan's series to be just as good as the first two, though not better. This book runs just a little slow after the quick pace of THE GREAT HUNT, but it is still Jordan at his best. Another good thing about this novel is that it's focus stays with other characters besides Rand, allowing the reader a break from having to constantly read from his perspective as the first two books made you do. The only real problem I have so far in this series is that Jordan's women are too unreal. They all think exactly alike, and I'm getting sick of them saying over and over how stubborn and stupid men are. It's just getting old. But despite this, I will still give the book a 10 because the third book still meets my expectations in a fantasy novel"
4,Good book,"It took too long to come to its conclusion, and that was really quick. I expected it to be more exciting and last longer in the end. Great book though, I really recommend it."
4,very compelling read yet dies in places.,"I believe this is one of the most intense books i have ever read to date yet, the author leaves alot to the readers imagination so as to give a sence of control. There is unfortunately too many places where the story leaves you thinking this has absolutely no relevence, but i have yet to find an author who can sustain the complete attention span of any reader when tranversing so many different topics."
4,definately read it if you liked the first 2 books,"Though the story did not progress nearly as fast in The Dragon Reborn as it did in The Eye of the World or The Great Hunt, I have to say that this was a fast and enjoyable read as there was lots of great character development. If you enjoyed the first two books, this one will not disappoint."
4,This is when it was good to be a WOT-er,"Man, these were the good old days, ya know? Rand and Mat and Perrin were actually DOING things. The women, though still annoying, were not yet gratingly so.Tollocs and fades still make appearances...and the plot advances.The series should have ended a book or two after this one.Instead, Jordan turned ""rich storytelling"" into straight up word mongering.Regardless, this is one of the gems. There is a real pace set by Rand's march towards the Stone and the reader is actually rewarded in the end.If you're new to the story, beware!All the books aren't like this.Stem"
5,For the love of god...,"If you plan on reading the entire series, PLEASE stop after this one. While Shadow Rising and arguably Fires of Heaven are just as good as the first three books in the series, this book does a great job at wrapping up most of the major plot points in the series so far. Take my word, this once great series falls off a cliff in the first few chapters of Lord of Chaos and comes to a resounding SPLAT in book ten. It gets better once Brandon Sanderson takes over, but trust me, it simply isn't worth it."
3,A good book but not a good sequel,"It is really a good book with a satisfying plot, characters with rich emotions and background and of'course the artistic power of the writer who makes you believe that these things are really happening. But after reading the first two books you are bound to expect more! The third one lacks the suspense and the surprises of the other two and it pays a great cost for the leading actor's - Rand that is- short role. Also this time it can be said that the book is tiring in a way. I do not aggree that the previous were but this one seems to be getting slowly to an end you can easily imagine.So as a sequel, I can say that the Dragon Reborn can be discouraging for most but cannot act as an obstacle for reading the fourth book. Besides, the writer weaves the plot as the writer wills and I think I can surely depend on his weaving."
3,Still more of the same,"My reviews for this series get shorter: It's still more of the same. A long travel-log with an action finale. The story proceeds a little bit more than in part two but the negative aspects of the series remain: It is too long-winded, written in a medicore style and features characters which are not that involving. Sorry, RJ, fans, please don't send a Gray Man to my home. Review written by Oliver Naujoks, Marburg/Germany."
4,Depth not quite realised,"The depth of the first two books in the 'wheel of time series' is not as apparent in this, the third book in the WOT series, yet it still is a facinating read with the characteristic dark Jordan underflow. The Dragon Reborn continues a series reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings but which manages to escape the trap so many fantasy writers have fallen into. The characters are dealt with in depth, and a strong storyline will ensure that the next book in the series will soon be yours...."
4,"Good, but not the best of the series.","Jordan's Wheel of Time is a great series, but the third book is quite a change from the first two. The main character, Rand, barely plays a part until the last few pages. This book focuses on three female characters, with plenty of male-bashing and travel descriptions thrown in. The two secondary characters, Mat and Perrin, also have big roles, fortunately--Mat was my favorite character in this book. I do enjoy the general writing style--including the detailed descriptions of people, places, and even horses--but more focus on Rand and less focus on male-bashing would have brought this book up to the standards of the first two. On to Shadow Rising..."
4,A Good book,Everyone loves these books its that simplenot his best but i like it. All fantasy readers should read these books no questions asked
4,Whoa! That was interesting!,"Although the title suggests that this book was the best of The Wheel of Time series, The Dragon Reborn was disappointing. The Great Hunt left me with an exciting feeling, but I was not hooked on The Dragon Reborn like I was on the first two books. Everyone I know (that reads The Wheel of Time) said to me that The Dragon Reborn was the best book of the entire series. I don't know what all the fuss was about. There is no doubt this book is one of the greatest books ever written, but it does deserve only four stars, rather than five."
2,Boring!,"This is the worst book in the series I have ever read! I had never read a book as boring as this! Even a text book is better! I was really satisfied with the first two books, but this one was just HORRIBLE! All the women are either beautiful or handsome! Aren't there any ""ugly"" people in Robert's stories! Its a good thing I didn't abandon the series afterwards becuase some parts are interesting after. I recommend that you skip this book becuase it is the most boring in the world and will only decrease your interest in reading the series."
1,Missing Pages,"Nothing against the story itself, but someone in the binding department at the publishers was asleep when they put this edition together. Pages 325 though 356 are totally missing and instead there are replications of 30 earlier pages from the book! Kind of ruins the flow of the story (not to mention a huge hiccup in the plot)! Buyer beware!!"
2,tiresome,"Maybe I am just a spoiled reader of fantasy novels. I have to say that this book just plods along with little imagination. The writing is dull as if one were to rub two stones together. The story seems endless and pointless.I say all of this because I am comparing Jordans books to those of George RR Martins amazing series. The two are almost like night and day. If you are angered that someone could trash Jordan like I am and if you have not read Martin's books, I highly suggest that you pick them up."
3,Mildly amusing.,"This book was mildly amusing and if it had been a gift instead of my paying for it I would have found it acceptable. However, it had little information not available via Google and really had almost no useful suggestions regarding the ongoing squirrel wars. The only thing that may yet prove useful mentioned in the book is pointing me towards Nixalite."
5,Outwitting Squirrels,Funny book! Son in law likes squirrels so he's going to get a kick out of this book. It arrived very quickly.
3,Short Sheeted,"The book is ok but the cover is not as wide as the actual pages. the vendor seemed to be "" right on to it"" with a promise to replace the book. I was glad about that since the purchase was meant for a gift, however, I am still waiting for the replacement copy."
4,This movie,"This is a very very good movie that really shows Chinese culture. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I was told when I was getting it that it was dubbed but when I got it, the movie was mandarin chinese with english subtitles."
4,Joan Sutherland under the baton of Richard Bonynge,"THE MERRY WIDOW, Franz Lehar's dizzying and delightful operetta chestnut, is given the grand treatment in this highlights album featuring Joan Sutherland.There have been many widows (including June Bronhill, Anna Moffo, Beverly Sills), though Joan Sutherland's WIDOW has always been especially grand. The supporting cast on this recording features Werner Krenn as Count Danilo with Valerie Masterson as Valencienne, Regina Resnik as Zo-Zo and John Brecknock as Camille, with Francis Egerton, John Fryatt, Graeme Ewer and the Ambrosian Singers.Sutherland's performance as Hanna Glawari is full of masterful strokes and she approaches the score with a twinkle in her eye, aware of the comedy in the piece. Richard Bonynge conducts the National Philharmonic Orchestra and they are especially chill-inducing with the Overture.All-in-all a superlative recording at a bargain price."
3,The Merry Widow,"This the version my wife wanted. Why? Because it ws in English. Anyway, Joan Sutherland! What more can I say!"
3,Merry Widow,The music is of course magnificient. However I am disappointed in Dame. Sutherland's performance.She takes certailly liberties that compromises the quality of the music.
5,"Pragmatic, Helpful and Timely","Managing IT as a Business is a no nonsense guide to making the IT function accountable for what it does and does not deliver. The auhor 'gets it'and provides real examples that demonstrate what gets measured, gets managed; and what gets managed, gets done. The book lays out a framework for looking at IT, making it easy to apply the principles in any IT environment. Overall, it's a great addition to the library. I highly recommend it."
1,Would make a good weapon,"I bought this toy for my Grand Kids to play with in the pool. After receiving it and seeing how much weighed and the unpredictable path it would take each time I threw in the pool, I took it out and away from the pool. This toy could cause a serious injury to a child or an adult."
5,You may not get what you want!,"I ordered the item pictured, but received a different model toypedo. Although not the end of the world (although my grandson, whom I bought it for was somewhat disappointed, I would have appreciated being told that I would not get the exact item ordered. If they had not reduced the price, I would have returned the item."
1,Ben Hur,I returned this video because it was defective and have not received credit on by gift certificate as of yet. Please confirm when this is done.Dorothy Harmon
5,Works great and invisible,"I bought this product about 2 years ago when it was priced much higher. It is a very sturdy build and on the heavier end but installs just fine and without any problems. It also nicely conceals the wires. Where I have it installed you don't really see this mount so you cannot appreciate it's beauty. However, it is in a more visible area then it will definitely look very nice. It is also very flexible allowing you to extend it forward and tilt it left/right. For the current price it is definitely a great buy! Would recommend it highly."
3,Heavy duty but limited positioning.,"I purchased 2 of these for about 2S dollars. It is very heavy duty for a single beam installation unit. (Screws into just 1 2x4 stud)When you pull it away from the wall, it moves to either the right or left. Works well if you plan to have it flat against the wall when not in use, and then pull it out and swivel the screen to point almost parrallel to the wall."
1,What a disappointment,Nothing new here....I have been waiting and waiting for this book and was very sad that it was so terrible
1,Did not like this at all,I cannot begin to express what this book represents to me. I'm sure it has it's followers and all the best to them. Not my cup of tea at all and not what I expected or I would not have spent my money on. If I could I would have given it a zero. Just my take on it.
3,Completely outdated,"I don't think this book is a useful advice on the efficient use of time anymore. At least, no so much as it may have been at the long time ago it was first published. If anything, the book is an interesting proof that, after all, time is and has always been the most valuable of commodities, so to speak."
2,More Lecture than How-To,"This book extols the virtues of finding time for ""living"" during the day. The author's aim seems to refute any excuse for not budgeting our time pursuing ""worthwhile"" pursuits. For example he proposes one read literature or study music composition while commuting by train instead of reading the newspaper. Most of today's people who are looking at time management are seeking ways to eek out a few hours of respite from self improvement."
3,A quick read,I found this to be quite an interesting read on a subject matter I've not considered before. It's a good read and makes you consider how you spend your time. In essence the book advocates using the hours in the day efficiently to meditate and learn something new.
1,Kind of a waste,Not much to offer except an abundance of prepositions. I put it down after about a half hour. I can't recommend it.
3,Just OK,The good part of the book is that makes you realize how limited our time is and the importance of taking advantage of the amount of time that we receive each day. It has good insights but is not very practical as I was expecting. Just OK.
2,it is more a reference book than real helper,"if you are looking for practical tips how to save your time, this book is not going to help you. it is 90 years old book full of reference to another books - classical or philosophical pieces. it is written for britissh officers reading newsper while commuting every morning to their work by train. on the end of a day, they are tired and dont have much time to work on themselves and on their higher ""spirit"". if that is your case, i think this book may help you. otherwise, i do not recommend it to you."
2,A disappointment.,"This book is filled with very general, basic concepts. The kind of concepts you would find in an average, unexciting book.If you have put any kind of serious though into time management, you would realize many of the points the author tries to create by your own means. You can do better, much better.I believe the author faults at only briefly going into the subject of time management. This book is a mere 45 pages, and it does not use all of them to the full extent. Quantity weighs far less than quality, but without quality to begin with you have a problem. The author attempts to teach successful time management theories in a short amount of time, briefly.You can't conquer Rome in a day."
4,Classic for good reason,"A short and sweet guide to making the most of one's life. Although it sounds at first like time management is the main theme, the book is really about balancing the demands of urban life with the need for introspection and contemplation so that neither time nor life ends up wasted. Good, inspirational message."
2,There is no such thing,It is possible but to everyone like me who has a million things to do it is nearly impossible. But it was free and free is always good.
3,2001 was much better,"If you're looking for a realistic football sim, definitly DO NOT buy Madden 2002.#1. The pass defense is WAY out of whack! The computer will complete about 90% of it's passes against you, and complete all of it's long bombs. I don't know how on earth EA let this game get out! (and every TE is a superstar catching 15 passes a game)#2. The screen pass is now impossible to do. Half the time the ball lands in front of the player, and even if you player does catch it, you are very lucky to get back to the line of scrimmage.#3. The computer can't run the ball worth jack. The game play is so unbalanced in this way.Ea also got rid of the accel clock feature, so you have to play 8 minute quarters to have a realistic game. (as in number of plays)Don't listen to the reviews that say this is the greatest sim ever, they are most likely marketing plants from EA sports. They do this with every game. Go to any Madden forum and you will hear the wide spread complaints about this game."
2,The PC version has serious gameplay issues,"I've heard good things about the PS2 version of M2k2, but the PC version has serious gameplay issues.Namely, the defensive secondary is nonexistent. 500-600 yard games from 3rd string QBs with bad offensive linemen and poor receivers are the order of the day. You could assemble a team of All-Star defensive players and pit them against the worst NFL Europe team and their 3rd string QB, and I guarantee you the NFL Europe team's QB will throw for over 350 yards and a QB rating over 100. They'll probably lose, but the scores in M2k2 games are very, very high. 65-54 is NOT an unusual score. I've tried every fix imaginable, and nothing helps. If EA patches this big problem, this could be a great game. The graphics are much better than last year's version."
4,PLAY COCAH MODE,"The thing I like in Madden 2002 is that there is a cocah mode. Its where you pick a team and you just have to pick the play and they would do it for you. To make it real you shuold make the view tv view while you are whatching it. Other than that, there are 32 teams, franchise, season, Nfl draft, fantsy draft, pro bowl and the statiums and the fans are real. It is worth the Money!"
2,"Looks Great, That's About It","The graphics for this game are fantastic, but boy does the gameplay stink. The review up top sums it up. Horrible, horrible, horrible AI. The people at EA should be ashamed of this, considering that this is last year's console version. Every pass is caught with one hand, forget about running the ball, every pass over the middle gets dropped, and your team's defense only has a prayer if you use the Dime. Forget about 4-3, that's a guaranteed touchdown. Do yourself a favor, spend 15 bucks and get Madden 2001, which is a heck of a lot more fun to play than this bag of frustration."
3,Just like 2001.,"Overall this games is very similar to 2001. They used the same autorun and main game interface that they used in 2001, but they spiffed it up. The close up view is really neat though. Plus you can make your own logos and field logos for your customized teams which is really cool. The flaws to this game are the fact that it does not work well with 2k or Xp. It says its compatible with 2k, but its (not). I have 2k with a GeForce 3 64 mb DDR and the menu is slow as hell and takes forever to load. Oh and god forbid Madden and Pat say a few more things and sound a little less Corny. I have nothing against John Madden or Pat Summeral in real life I believe they are the best color commentators in the game, but in Madden 2002 they sound (bad). Overall this game is decent and gets you all the new stats and updated rosters and a few nice new features."
3,"Good, but only good enough to tease","Close to being an excellant game. But the gameplay is very disapointing if you are really ingterested in the detail of coaching and playing a game. It is very frustrating to have everything look and feel great in a play when for no reason the player does not do what you expected him to. The D-back with tight coverage but always giving up the pass, your reciever wide open dropping half the passes that hit him, etc. Also, EA sports sets an expectation, that the players as represented in the game with their real names, will have the skills and statistics of their real life counterparts; however Aaron Glenn is the worst cornerback on the jets. There are many similair examples."
3,This game has glitches,"On my computer the graphics are really glitchy. I don't know why. The gameplay is good, though. I like franchise mode because it goes to an unlimited amount of years (or I think so). I think they should make the graphics less glitchy with 2003 but otherwise it is good."
3,"Graphics are great, realism is not so great","I generally buy a new Maaden game in the even number years: I had 98 and 2000 (coincidence, mainly). I skipped the Madden 2001 for no reason other than I was satisfied with 2000. I was ready for an updated version and got 2002. The graphics are excellent, much improved over older versions. I also like the Interface, but have not played online yet.With that, let me say:The AI is horrible. There are a number of complaints on the EA message boards about the DB AI, and I must agree with them. DBs going to the wrong places, receivers all making one-handed leaping grabs. Tony Banks racking up 578 yards against Tampa Bay? Tampa Bay racking up 68 points against anyone? Frustrating. If EA can fix this issue and make it more realistic, then this game will be worth 5 stars."
1,Major Technical Problems,"I bought this game, and had problems as soon as I installed it. I went to the EA web site and found I was not alone. The discussion groups at the EA site are flooded with people that are having huge problems with this game. Unless you have a P3+ and a high end video card dont bother buying this game."
3,Great game terrible AI,"Well, Madden 2002 is all in all good but not great. First off the AI stinks, thats it. Everything about the AI is bad, first the game plays out too slow, a 5:00 4 quarters goes out for a long time. Then its impossible to stop the defensive pass plays, there are many consectutive completions in your game. But thats the only gripe I have about this game, the rest is really good. I forgot the commentary stinks, dont have Pat Summeral do the commentary, he is dull and boring, thank god 2003 version has micheals in the game. The rookie difficulity is too easy and the pro diffuclity is too hard. On rookie I won with 49ers 45-14 vs. Saints, it is good to win, but the pro is too difficult, the lions beat me 35-7. Great graphics and real live gamplay but...EA FIX THE AI...... you would probably have 5 stars if you did that"
2,"Can be fun, But TOTALLY UNREALISTIC","This game can be fun and addictive, however it can be frustrating. The computer will always end up winning any game you play. I have started several different Franchises, but have only won 1 game! One example: I was ahead by 1 point with about 50 seconds left, and 6 of my men missed a 80 yard for touchdown RB screen pass.The CPU will NEVER run a balanced offense, if they are ahead by 21 points with 20 minutes left, they will still throw on every down! Expect about 400+ yards passing every game for the CPU. MOST frustrating...9 drops in 1 quarter??? 50% of the time a reciever will drop the ball when he gets hit. The graphics are AMAZING, but a SOMEWHAT REALISTIC game is more important to me. Hopefully Madden 2003 will have a better CPU offense and better human controlled defense."
2,It's okay...if you just play exhibition games,"The commentary is the same stock audio that they have been using for the last 2+ years. The graphics are first rate. The A.I.? Well, I didn't actually get that far. I'm sorry but this is years iteration has THE WORST management tools I've ever had the displeasure of using. I have always considered myself an excellent evaluator of on field talent and have enjoyed the free agent, trade, and draft systems of the previous football games I've purchased...Madden 2002 is woefully lacking in these areas. It's not that the options aren't there, they are just the worst I've seen in recent years. Too bad."
4,Madden 2002 scores!,"I love all the major EA Sports games especially NFL, NHL and Triple Play Baseball. All Of EA's stuff is very good. I cannot wait for NHL 2002 also. Madden NFL 2002 is such a great game."
3,"Good Game, But lacking something",Hi I am a premium playtester and recieved privalages to get this game early. The good: Graphics Franchise Mode 2 minute drillThe Bad: NOTHING (exept minor graphics changes and the 2 minute drill) has beed changed from last year. In My opinion... you are better off getting Madden 2001 and using the extra money to buy one of these: Empire Earth- EXTRORDINARY 'Nuff Said Warcraft 3- Wow NHL 2002- Nothing I MEAN NOTHING even compeats with this sports series. Thanks and GG(good gaming =) )
4,"Good Game, Somewhat Unrealistic","The Game Has great graphics, and team management in season mode is fun. I like season mode better than single game and season mode provides interesting play, player progression, and management. However, the pass defense for human controlled teams is bad and unrealistic. The human rushing game is quite effective yet the cpu rushing game is nonexistant. This provides skewed statistics. Overall, the game is fun to play."
1,Disappointed,"Very Disappointing. I bought for my grandson and unfortunately did not look at the dimensions or weight. The box and rocks are small. The rocks are about the size of a large marble. From looking at the picture, I thought it was bigger. The information inside the box is like instructions you would receive, not in a book form. Now I have to buy something to go with this since it looks very cheap. One of the pitfalls of buying online."
5,the original. plus 80s movies are great.,"great story.great cast.dramatic.funny.its a great movie.its made my cut.and there arent that many that have.i could, have and will watch this movie time and again.rent or buy it.i dont even like western movies.but this one is different.go..now..watch a trailer or just rent it now.its good..Court Adjourned."
4,Wild in the Wild Westg,"Somehow, popular critics of this movie seemed to miss the point (as they sometimes do). This movie is meant to be fun, and it is. I don't know a person that doesn't like this movie. I'm 27 years old, and having just watched it again, it hasn't lost a thing."
4,"Ride, Cowboys Ride....","So it was with some pleasure when I got a copy of this BD for a birthday gift. The movie still holds all of its charms, with or without the historical errors. Billy the Kid and Gang, including the brilliant performance by Kiefer Sutherland, ride out on a heated trail of vengeance against the murderer of their mentor,played by the fan favourite Terrence Stamp (Kneel before Zod!)The BD picture is restored fair well, and the sound sounds fair in both the 2.0 and 5.1, and if I recall the main menu it also includes 6.1 DTS. But that is hard to verify, seeing how you can only get to the main menu when you first play the disc. The picture quality is just fine, with none of the previous listed reviews. All in all, it is a fair shake for a 80's classic. One would just think the BD version would have been given a bit more heft."
5,And just when I thought it couldn't get any better ;p,"I've been watching this movie at least once a month, sometimes once a week, since I was four years old. So the past sixteen years. I know the whole thing by heart and can even watch it with the sound down so low that one word can tell me where it is. Having the commentary, which I normally hate in movies, was the best thing ever. I learned so much more about the movie and actors, why somethings happened for reasons that were just goofy. Like the fart, hehe. I've done huge amounts of research of Billy the Kid because of this movie and even still learned things from this movie that I didn't know. GREAT MOVIE! Thanks SO MUCH!!!! =)"
3,Fun movie,Fun movie from the past that keeps you entertained - and is a great setup for the 2nd in the series.
5,Young Guns,One of the best movies of its time.Dermot Mulroney was just starting out in this movie. Great western.
4,great western~!,WOW GREAT MOVIE HAVE THE FIRST ONE REALLY LIKE THAT ONE AND THIS ONE IS PLAYED OUT VERY GOOD AS WELLTHE ACTORS ARE FANTASTIC !!!!!!
4,Not ANYWHERE near as bad as people say.,"Very old movie. I didn't have this in my collection so picked it up on Blu-Ray. Yes it not a perfect transfer but I need to chime in hear and let anybody that likes this movie to let you know it is a good purchase. It could be better but it is not any where near ""Unwatchable"".Just make sure you get it cheap.....:)"
1,bad spot,I bought this as a gift. When we watched it for the first time there was a bad spot in the movie and it got stuck.
1,Horrible blu-ray transfer. Worst in my collection. Terrible jaggies.,This is a review of the blu-ray transfer. It is just terrible. It's the worst in my collection of over 140 discs. There is stairstepping on everything. It's just awful. I don't know why Amazon insists on sticking reviews of DVD in with the blu-ray reviews.I just want to warn people that this is not worth an upgrade. There was some sort of serious error in the conversion process. I wish I could get my money back!
3,It's Fun. . .And That's About It,"Made more to showcase a covey of young hunks than to tell a viable story, YOUNG GUNS blazes across the screen like a lead bullet from a six-shooter. Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Charlie Sheen, Dermot Mulroney, and Casey Siemaszko (who actually brings depth to his character) portray the ""Regulators""--led by Estevez as an annoying Billy the Kid--a band of vigilantes that likes to shoot first, and ask questions later.The movie has its moments--some witty dialogue, a good dose of pulse-pounding action--but overall it's an exercise in silliness. Jack Palance is a wonderful villain (as usual), and crusty Brian Keith appears in the film's best scene, but the movie is like a ten-year-old on a sugar rush: pure, unleashed energy without purpose or direction.YOUNG GUNS is entertaining, but isn't meant to be taken seriously, only viewed as a superficial Western meant to launch a handful of careers.--D. Mikels"
2,Shoud've been called Young BUNS,"This movie was supposed to have brought back the Western (like Unforgiven also attempted to do years later, but that's another story), but it wasn't really about the Western, it was about the pinups who starred in it. You could just see the girls drooling until a puddle formed under their seats. Enjoy it for entertainment's sake, but don't look for fine acting or even historical accuracy."
2,"bad story, bad acting, bad western","this was made when the actors were all young and still trying to learn their trade. they had not. i do not know who wrote the story, but he ought not to lose his day job. all those who took part ought to learn about the genre, because they missed the whole pointdo not buy this movie unless you like to spend almost two hours looking at nice horses and trying to ignore what is happening around them."
4,The Forgotten One,"Young Guns was a film that wasn't appreciated at its time. Sure it made 45 million dollars in 1988, but sometimes profit is overlooked by the quality of the film. Every time I watch Young Guns it makes me smile. The excellent cast (except Charlie Sheen) was outstanding. But the performance by Emilio Estevez was one step higher. His portrayal as ""Billy the Kid"" was phenomenal. The scene where Billy taunts the man in the bar, and then shoots him, was hilarious. Even though Young Guns was overlooked, in my eyes it will never be forgotten."
3,"Young Guns was a good movie, not great, but worth seeing.","Young Guns wasn't original enough to be classified as a great show, but it's worth(at least) a rental. It was better than most people gave it credit for, and it had enough action to keep me interested. A number of actors turn in great performances in this one. As I said above, it's worth a look."
3,One of the few Westerns I love,"Being a film buff all of my life, Westerns were the one film genre that I would prefer not to watch growing up. The only westerns I care for are Sileverado, Unforgiven, The Quick and The Dead & Posee. Young Guns is a mixture of semi pop culture from the late eighties and western action. The cast is good and the direction is sharp from Christopher Cain."
4,Best quality so far,"If you own bargain flat panel tvs, projectors, blu ray players then you get what you pay for. I know this blu ray movie can be given an even better transfer but this is still alot better then any of the dvd transfers."
4,Maybe they'll make a movie,"I would have like more episodes than this. But, at least it's something. Maybe at some point they will release it by season or release the complete series onto dvd.And why did the show get canceled so soon? It was a great show.Maybe they will still make a movie.Here's an idea for one:A few years later for both Phil and Keely in their respective times (the show has been off the year a few years). Phil comes back to be with Keely. Maybe the future has been messed up since they got back because by going back to the future they changed it. Because Phil and Keely were supposed to get married and have a bunch of kids and do other stuff that no longer happened cause Phil left. Maybe it took a few years to escape the future and return to Keely. Maybe Phil has to win her back cause she's dating someone else by then."
3,Not too bad but 4 eps is a rip off,"This dvd isnt too bad, I'm not really into POTF but I run a fansite on Amy Bruckner [amy-bruckner.net] and so I got the dvd to make caps and will get another DVD if Disney brings it out.The only problem I have with it is it's only got 4 episodes..why on earth didnt they release all of Season 1? probably because they knew they could get more money for them if they do it bit by bit."
5,Phil of the Future DVD Review,The DVD was in great condition when I got it. I was satisfied with how Amazon had shipped it. I really enjoyed watching the DVD a lot especially since Phil of the future is not on TV anymore. I am hoping that some day the whole series will come out on DVD.
3,A decent addition to the series,"Copperhead picks up the Nathaniel Starbuck series at Ball's Bluff and the Pennisular Campaign. Although the entire book is devoted to a fairly narrow slice of the war, the plot moves at an enjoyable pace. There aren't many new characters introduced, which isn't a bad thing. There are a couple of attempts to explain Starbuck's curious choice to fight for the South (a ""copperhead""), despite the fact he was born and raised in Boston. As in the first book, the explanations don't come across as particularly believable. However, it does serve as a mechanism to support an espionage subplot that's interesting. The book stands by itself, but I'd recommend reading the initial installment first."
4,A good civil war fictional story,"Cornwell's 2nd installment in the Starbuck Chronicles builds on the first novel. Nate Starbuck is the hero with similar characteristics as found in Cornwell's other novels.While some reviewers find this formula tired, I find it very entertaining. With every successful novel, I grow a little fonder of Cornwell's characters.I also enjoy the way Cornwell interposes true to life characters from the Civil war into the story.If you are a fan of historical fiction, I recommend this series."
3,The Nathaniel Starbuck Chronicles: Part Two of Four,"Nathaniel Starbuck is back again, and fighting begins anew with the Civil War at the battles of Ball's Bluff and Seven Pines. Starbuck's mettle is tested, but he is nevertheless victorious. The Confederates are still unable to deal with the fact that Starbuck is a Yankee fighting against his own people.Inevitable, he is accused of being a spy, chased, brutally interrogated, but he is not the guy they're looking for. Starbuck's only choice is to find out who the real traitor is, taking him back to his people, who are now his enemies. Copperhead delves deeper into the psyche of Starbuck, as the reader becomes one with him, joining him in his never-ending war where everyone seems to be against him.Originally published on November 4th, 2002.Go to BookBanter [...] for over five hundred reviews and over forty exclusive author interviews, and more."
3,Good historical adventure,"Bernard Cornwell is highly skilled at the historical novel, whatever the era. Here we are treated to a Yankee serving in the Confederate forces while his brother serves the Union cause.A few wrong words here and there and the story would simply fall apart; it is that close to being unbelievable. But Cornwell is skilled and always retains control of his material, so he succeeds at weaving his tale of battle, treason, cowardice and heroism, all based (loosely) on actual events with the occasional fictional, but believable, character thrown in for color.The details of the story don't really matter. Cornwell could tell any story well and keep the reader involved as he does here.Jerry"
2,Nate Makes No Sense,I rate this book 2 stars relative to Cornwell's other work. It is the first book by him that I will not save for a future re-read. The issue is that the main character's motives make no sense and in no way are noteworthy. Nate is not a functioning fictional character.But as a fan I will try #3 in the series just to see if the Cornwell majic returns at all.
4,Yale or Harvard?,"Great book but did Starbuck go to Yale or Harvard? In Rebel and in Battle Flag we are told that Starbuck went to seminary at Yale, but in Copperhead (p30 end of page) we are told that Starbuck and Adam met up at Harvard, hmmmm, I thought those were different schools.All in all a good tale with a good description of life from the view of the south."
5,Great!!,"If you enjoy historical novels about battles, you must read Cornwell's books. His books are the kind that you just don't want to put down."
4,A Behind The Scenes Look At The Civil War,"If one is too insistent on the principal figure having a consistent psychology, then this book is not for you. It does have an interesting mix of characters, and it gave me a sense of the personal dynamics of life during the Civil War (when one thought of distance and transportation in terms of being on the back of a horse). The depiction of battle from the perspective of a regular soldier, with the killing being an entirely local phenomenon, the continuous confusion, and no picture of the greater strategy (are we actually dying for some good purpose, or is my commander an idiot?), is well illustrated. I don't know if I will bother with the rest of the series, but I thought this book was worth the read. Having been at Manassas/Bull Run, I also found the first book of this series interesting."
1,Video disappointment,"There a large parts of this DVD where the video and audio are out of sync. I expect to see this on home videos and 'bootleg' copies, but not commercial DVDs."
1,I couldn't believe my eyes...,"I caught this movie the other night on TV.I had never heard of it,but thought "" Okay, Sean Connery, Science Fiction, how bad can it be?"" In a word,awful.The effects were pretty good (especially that giant head),but everyone just seemed to be in it for a paycheck. And more than once, I found myself wondering what the heck was going on. Maybe I just didn't get the message that Boorman was trying to convey,or maybe there wasn't one. I could be wrong.All I know is that the image of Sean Connery in a red loin cloth is still burned on to my retinas."
2,Not one of Connery's best moments,"I really don't know what he was thinking when staring as Zed in this film. It was a box office failer. If you are a cult fan this is the movie for you. Otherwise, if you have nothing else better to watch, this film will help you sleep because it is boring."
5,If Stanley Kubrick filmed an Ed Wood script with no money,"This one crazy-a** gooneybird of a movie, with more laughs per minute than most comedies, more real science fiction atmosphere than all of Spielberg`s sf movies together, and more ideas than all the films in the top ten box office list from any given year. A glorious mess. Most `so bad they`re good` movies bore me; this one I`ve seen maybe a dozen times in the last 30 years. For genuine wackiness, you need a talented filmmaker who`s lost in his ambitions. There are great images and silly costumes, interesting ideas and unbelievable lack of choice, bad writing and adults waving their hands and going `AHHHHH!` as a form of punishment. I don`t believe any movie collection `must` have any movie, but no real movie lover should be without this little burning hunk of celluloid insanity. Best watched after midnight on a weekend, so you can watch it again if you can`t believe it, or sleep late--you`ll need it."
3,"Sean Connery as ""Zed"" ...","This one is a flawed classic. By way of disclosure, I liked this movie and watch it from time to time. It is really allegorical, in the sense that it is doubtful that anyone is going to design the flying head craft or anysuch. On the other hand, this is an apocalyptic film featuring interesting ideas, such as the deprivation of immortality as penal punishment.The young Sean Connery is great fun in this one as the mutant superior ""Zed."" I found this film's storyline difficult to follow, however, and for this among other reasons I dinged it two stars. Nevertheless, this film is worth seeing and the DVD is well worth owning. I won't spoil the ending, but there is one and it will make sense to the viewer even if, like me, you get lost along the way in the storyline.Not a perfect flick, but recommended nonetheless. RJB."
2,Zardoz - Its for Connery,"Zardoz is a weird mix of Greek mythological ideas, acid images, Existentialism, in a convoluted disorganized rambling plot@! Sean Connery is a fine actor with a fine body, past and even in 2009. 1974 when this film was released was in the time of self serving ideologies. This film is the epitome of this but with visual reminiscent of he Trip (another equally bad film).The actual special effects were interesting, carnival-like and keeps you involved in the film, though the substance does not. I understand Boormen films are much better now a days.It never really pulls it together outside of defining the essence of why God and man constantly are redefined through the life of an individual. In 2009, nothing here has not been better explored by other venues.Beelzebub is more relevant than knowledge is itself. Mr. Connery's next film with Mariam in the title is far better as a firm.But for the collector it is a must have!Borish spin!"
2,Most hilariously horrible film I've seen,"Although this is worth seeing for Sean Connery in a red diaper, the rest is just so, so bad.The incoherent and poorly developed plot as well as completely unlikable characters earns this movie a place in horrible movie heaven.There's everything for the fan of extra-crappy sci-fi including flying stone heads and gratuitous nudity."
4,zardoz,"great contemporary movie, more of a cult film. typical for the era, good movie to add to the sen Connery collection."
3,Zar-doze,"The opening scene is worthy of a rental.The rest of the film wallows in pseudo existentialist tripe.Director, John Boorman, wants us to think he is as smart as a futurist Ken Russell, Kubrick or Richard Lester film...Sorry to say, he falls way short of all three...Conclusion:If you're looking for a confused Sean Connery swathed in a diaper-- spouting Jean Paul Sartre' philosophical crap then, ""Zardoz"" is your film...Too bad-- The opening scene is genius...Nice try John Boorman"
2,Zardoz the Weirdo,"I love British film, and their quirky humor. Of course, like all SciFi, there's a message, which in this case was melodramatic. Do we really want to ... (don't want to give away the what we want). It's all silliness, and somehow Sean Connery fits the part perfectly. The cinematography could have improved, and it was obvious that it took place on English country side somewhere. If people are not brilliant, rich or the elite, are they really that stupid and ovine? I don't think so. If you like campy, this is a good one to watch with friends and make fun of,"
3,Surprisingly good,"This movie defintiely tries to do too much, and it has WAY too much cheesy stuff typical of '70s scifi(not enough clothing, meaningless mixtures of high and low technology, intrusive and mostly purposeless special effects), but the story is pretty ambitious, and the acting is not bad. There's also some weird messages outside the movie, and some pretty pretentious stuff, but the world that the movie creates is kind of fascinating, with a few ultra high tech people controlling a bunch of low-tech people, and stuff. Worth watching, for sure."
2,"Strange, misbegotten film","The Bottom Line:A colossal misfire from John Boorman which is recently undergoing a critical re-evaluation that it manifestly does not deserve, Zardoz has all the hallmarks of a pet project that only works as a film in the crazy mind of its auteur: between the outlandish costumes, giant floating heads, half-baked ideas and slow pace, there's very little recommend this film aside from the fact that I haven't seen any others like it.2/4"
2,"Up, Up And Away...","Zed (Sean Connery) hitches a ride inside of a giant, flying, stone head. Once aboard, he shoots it's occupant dead and flies off to ""The Vortex"", a place where the ""Eternals"" live. This is a land full of men and women who have no sense of what real living is all about. They just loll around, musing and pontificating about nothing. Zed spices things up for these immortal buffoons by being different and, oh yeah, by having a male organ that works! I kid you not! The rest is mainly Zed finding out that what he thought would be heaven is actually pretty dull. Unfortunately, so is this movie! John Boorman (Deliverance, Excalibur) wrote, produced, and directed this elephant tranquilizer. Although, it does get an extra star for that hilarious flying head..."
2,when you have absolutely nothing better to do,"Look, let's not kid ourselves: despite Sean Connery, this is a full-on B movie. Writing a ""review"" doesn't really make sense. (Yet here I am.)Assuming you're not stranded on an island with no other form of entertainment, the only good reasons I can imagine for watching Zardoz are:1) You are a student of film or anthropology, or2) You really want to look at attractive young women's breasts, and are cut off from the 'net, or3) You are with a group of college friends, and not completely sober.This is perfect for (2) or (3) - perhaps a drinking game. Enjoy."
5,Fun Flick!!,"Some may find this movie a little weird and outdated, but I've loved it for years! Different strokes for different folks... Guess I tend to enjoy the 'offbeat' more than most, but as far as I'm concerned, this is a truly wonderful movie! In fact, being outdated, is one of the things that makes it so much fun to watch..."
3,GOOD MOVIE,"This is a good movie, dealing with many interesting themes: immortility, power, social structure, rules and control...The only ""problem"" with it is that is an old movie, and in some ways, it shows.Many people would find it a little ""slow"" for today standards on SF films, but if one tries to let this below and understand what the movie's trying to tell us, it still is an enjoyable ride."
4,This is an onion of a movie.,"I'll be brief with this review. My first review of this never made it onto the site, I probably sweared too much in it. Anyway, this is a HARD-CORE sci-fi movie. It has deep undertones and messages within it that you have to really pay attention to or you'll miss them. You can tell Sean really isn't into the role. He has the look on his face that he is making a piece of crap and knows it. But hey he has bills to pay. The hilarious part is seeing him in what one Youtuber dubbed ""hooker boots"". The film is at times so wierd and bad you find yourself not being able to forget it after viewing it. Watch this if you love BAD movies and watch if you love a film that demands analying afterward. I myself like this film now, but it is a fair bet that most people probably won't. Watch if you love weird stuff like 2001: A Space Odyssey and other mind bending sci-fi flicks."
1,All Time Worst Big Budget Film,"I have to laugh at the reviewers who suggest that 'dumb' people won't like this film. As if this film is some sort of deep, intellectually stimulating masterpiece.This film is a perfect illustration of the famous Shakespeare line, ""full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""There are a lot of 'confusing' plot points and hallucinatory extremely obvious symbollism to make the film look deep, but when you get right down to it, the film mostly just makes some very cliched obvious statements. Excellent cinematography and gratuitous nudity notwithstanding, the film is surprisingly dull and lacks any sort of emotion or suspense to make it a worthwhile film to watch."
1,It lived up to its billing.,"My friends and I were having a discussion on the worst movies we've ever seen, and one of us swore this was the worst, bar none. I put up ""Omega Force"" as being the worst, and thought I had an easy victory, but no, Zardoz won the title of ""Worst movie ever"" hands down.You have to see it to believe it, and so you probably should, for that reason alone (as there are no others). From the opening scene where there's a guy's floating head (with a drawn-on mustache) talking to you, to the giant stone floating head that's really an airplane of sorts that spits out rifles, this movie is the worst of them all. Poor Sean Connery. He must have been starving to agree to make this. See the movie. Buy starvin' Sean a hamburger."
1,absolute Zardozzzzzzzzzzz....snore,"I saw this 20 years ago on Mexican Cablevision. My memory was beguiling. I ordered it from Amazon and sat down at the weekend in Japan to rewatch. 20 years older and wiser? I found it dated, trivial, hippiesque and boring. Notions of religion mixed with awful costumes and dreary warnings about world destruction. And of course not a jot of wit or tension in it. But lots of pretension. Rename it Zar-doze."
1,It is a waste of film,"In the arena of bad movies, this one is right up there with Plan 9 From Outer Space only worse. This is worse than ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" or even ""Eegah!"" This movie is a stinkburger. Why anyone would waste their life on this drivel is beyond me."
3,"Thank You, John Boorman","The director's commentary track alone on this dvd has paid for itself. It gives credit to my view that ""Yes, I *got* the movie, but I still find it amusing""."
4,This movie helped a college student discover Beethoven...,"As an impressionable college student, the idea that immortality could be undesireable was a big one to wrap my mind around. Add to that the moving score, Beethoven's 7th Symphony, and you have a movie that will always be a classic...at least in my mind! Parts of it seems a bit silly, but who's to say which of our ideas will turn out to be so."
4,I first saw this as a teenager,"This will be a funny kind of review, because I've only seen this film once -- in Richmond, VA, in the ornate movie palace known as the Byrd Theatre, during its original theatrical release. I was an impressionable teenager living in a buttoned-down fundamentalist family. At first viewing, I was disturbed and my gray matter was stretched from the very opening sequence -- the head of Zardoz moving around on the screen while a voice-over spoke about God in malleable terms the likes of which I had never heard. Then Sean Connery appeared and he exuded a virile, marauding energy that hooked me into the plot. After the bare-breated women inside the dome made their appearance, this film was destined to be a cinematic milestone in my life. I'm looking forward to seeing this film again for the second time as a 40-something adult with far wider horizons."
2,not up to Reebok standards,This was the second pair of Reebok Time and a Half shoes that I have owned. Just like the first one the sides split out after about a year and a half. The shoes were comfortable but not durable enough. Will not purchase again.
5,Zach King adventure in the Wilderness series.,"Savages is a great addition to the Wilderness series. Nate King's son Zach and his fiancee Louisa, go to St. Louis so Zach can meet her relatives. They have troubles, and they find out how corrupt cities can be. Nate King is mentioned in the book, but isn't in it. Zach King is grown up now, and faces life on his own. This adds to the series, and doesn't take anything away. I liked reading about St. Louis and the author David Robbins does a great job of capturing the feel of that era. Enjoyable book in the high quality Wilderness series."
3,"Good nailer, but ...","This is a good product but the PN100 does not come with the necessary accessories to do all it says it can do. If you want to drive anything bigger than 16d you need a large bore nose, which is only available if you buy the PN100K. I think this is a bit lame on Bostich's part. I even called customer service to buy the nose seperately, but it is only available with the kit. What a drag."
5,A Must Have!,"I bought this nailer for my husband thinking it might be helpful with all the home improvements we do. Let me tell you, this nailer is awesome! We used it for everything from framing walls to the rails on our deck. It definitely beats having to hammer all those nails! This is one of the best home improvement tools we have ever bought."
4,Nice but needs the glove,This tool is a great value and works extremely well in tight places. I also used it to nail all the nails in my joist hangers for my deck. Would definitely recommend.
5,palm nail gun,"bought this nail gun for installing hurricane straps on a large home on the coast. works great, nice and small for hard to get to places."
5,Very nice product!,"This nailer is a must have for any construction job! It is easier and faster than a hammer, obviously in tight places but it is so easy to operate, you could use it in place of a hammer if you wished."
5,Very Handy Tool,"I have never used palm nailer, even 20 years of carpentry works. I bought it from Amazon. It works very good and is handy for small areas and joist hangers. Very,very, useful tool."
4,Decent tool.,"It's loud. Really loud. It sounds like an impact driver in an auto shop when they are putting on your wheels..I found it takes a little practice to drive the nails on an angle. Straight nailing is easy. Angle nailing seems to bend longer nails (at least it did for me.) Also, make sure your compressor can push a lot of air. This tool is small but needs a good amount of CFM..For general framing, I would use a regular framing nailer. For tight spots you can't swing a hammer, this tool is nice."
4,"Fun Game, But Check Min. Requirements","My son got this for Christmas and was a little upset when it didn't run well on his computer -- it required a 400Mhz minimum processor. We loaded on to another computer and found that is a fun game, which requires skill and patience -- as well as a mastery of the mouse. Tnis game is sure to please any Harry Potter fan."
3,MystifiedPlayer,"I wish I could rate this game higher but neither myself or my son can get past the Learning Spells portion of the game. No matter what we try, Quirrell just tells us that the shape is not right. We each tried for over 20 minutes and still can't get it. Anyone with any advice, please let us know.I found it very frustrating that the information enclosed with the software did not provide much in the way of trouble shooting. Also, online help or tips would be great. Again, maybe there is more of this type of information later in the game but we just can't get there.For all the excitement the receipt of this game generated, the frustration has been doubled. Hopefully, we can figure it out. Any help would be appreciated."
1,Buy the Lego series instead,"I bought this because I've been bored and needed a Harry Potter fix since there are no more movies coming. I wish I had spent my money on something else as I feel like it was completely wasted on this game.The graphics are pretty awful, even taking into consideration the date this was made. It feels very rushed, which is likely the case as EA probably knew people would buy it no matter how crappy due to the franchise. The save points feel awkward, as most of them are in the middle of objectives. There is basically no deviation from the main objectives to do (no exploring, no side-quests, nada) expect for quidditch after it's unlocked (which was boring to me). Also, you'll likely put the volume on mute after about 10 minutes because the constant repeating/yelling of spells is grating on the ears and nerves.I didn't even bother finishing this game. A video game has to be pretty bad if I'd rather just be bored than play it."
4,Review for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"I have continously played this game. I have gotten my frustrations out of the challenges in the game, but all in all I really enjoy it. I am currently playing it for a third time."
1,Harry Potter game is not as good as it should be,"It seems to me that Electronic Arts tried way way too hard to get this game out before Christmas 2001, and the game itself shows it. The 3D graphics, as said before, are very primitive, and in many cases are extremely poor done - objects come in and out of walls, if you walk too far around some objects, they disappear, etc. The game also comes with no instruction guide, so you have to figure out some very weird key combinations for yourself. Overall, I'd have to say that Harry Potter failed as a good game, and I think I'll stick with the old but well-put together graphics of Doom."
4,Not Perfect but Quidditch is AWSOME,"This game borrows a great deal from the Zelda series for Nintendo. Graphics are nice and appropriately splashy, and many (but not all) of the story elements are in tact. They've made the book work well as a computer game.The best thing about this game is Quidditch. I stayed up all night playing through the tournament. It's FANTASTIC. You get a real rush when you zoom way up over the field to try and find the Snitch...and when you spot it....vrrrrrrrrrmmmmmm....you nosedive down to scoop it up. All the while, you're dodging Bludgers and other players. Lee Jordan even gives commentary. It's just incredible and they're crazy not to make a full online Quidditch game. Once you get to the first Quidditch match in the game, you unlock an option on the main menu to play a tournament at any time.The puzzle/platform levels are fine, but Quidditch alone makes it worth every penny"
3,Harry Potter,"I am a HUGE fan of Harry Potter, and this game had its ups and downs. Yes the graphics need work, but I had fun with this game for a month or so. I think younger kids would really like this game because they might not mind the repitition. I wish I hadnt of wasted my money on it though. I got halfway through the game and gave up because it was just the same old thing after awhile (collect a wizard card, walk over some every flavor beans, shout FLIPENDO! at a rock) I give it three stars just because it's kinda cool to know that your favorite book has a video game."
1,This is a waste of money!,"Unless you have the newest computer capability, you cannot play this game. I bought this (the site did not mention the needs for your computer) and it went as sloww as molassas in January! I would recomend the Gameboy Version instaed. The coloring is very dark, so it is hard to see dark halls or anything of that sort. Keep posted for i may sell mine!"
4,Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone Computer Game Review,"I like this computer game, but it has a lot of instruction and talking where there doesn't need to be. At the beginning it tells the whole story of Harry Potter to brief you before you play, but I think that if you have the game you have already read the books, so this is kind of boring. Also, the lips of the people don't move when they talk, which is kind of weird. But it has really cool graphics and it doesn't get boring in the middle like most games. There is always something new to do. Overall it is a pretty awesome game. That is why I give it 4 stars."
5,Pure and simply fantastic,"I got this game for my kids and I cannot believe that 1 week later I am still playing it! I am addicted to it. It has fantastic graphics if you are using a good graphics card and Direct X 8. It is so smooth and accurate as to be almost unbelievable. But the best part is that it has SO many worlds whithin it that you are always surprised, startled, and blown away by it's pure fun and excitement. I haven't had this much fun since I was a kid and it does just that.... makes me a kid again. Your kids will fall in love with this game. And watch out, because you will too if you're a kid at heart. Enjoy"
2,Who play tested this?,"I bought this game for my 9 year old son. I am an avid gamer and expected nothing short of perfection when buying this game. I will say that the graphics are well done and the game play was really fun, albeit short lived. I finished the game in about 6 hours. I know I am an adult, but my son will be done in about another 12 hours. The thing that really bothered me was the inability to go back to the places I had previously visited. There was only one direction in this game and that was forward. So to find every secret and get 100% of the game you need to start a new game from the beginning or take your time going through, which then can be a drag as you are always excited to get to the next thing... I give it 2 stars. I would not pay more than $... for this game."
1,Al,"The game is buggy. I encountered poor sound on all systems I tried it on. Can't bypass the opening screens. Slow loading. All games have issues, but these seem worse than normal.EA could have done much better. May not run on some systems at all."
1,It's Soooooooooooooo Hard!!!!!!!!,I think this game is really hard. I tried getting past malfoy soooooo many times. Finelly my uncle had to do it for me. Now I'm trying the troll. I tried it twenty one times!!! I still can't do it. My uncle can't do it either. It's not mch fun if you can't do it. Next time don't make it so hard!!!!
1,Hate It,"My daughter got this game for Xmas and hates it. She is 7 years old and cannot understand it so she never plays it. My husband has also tried to play it in order to help her understand and he can't play it either. We thought she would really like the game since she loved the movie and the books, but she doesn't."
5,I LOVE IT,IT IS GREAT FOR THE CHILDREN AND IT HAS MAGIC ASND IT IS CHALLENGING FOR AGES 5-13 IT IS REALLY INTERESTING TO PLAY AND IT IS JUST FUN TO PLAY OVER AND OVER AGAIN
5,Harry Potter Computer game is out of this world!!,"The new Harry POtter computer game is the most fun game i've played in a long time!! it has great characters, effects, challenges, and even Quidditch!!"
1,Beware...if you are using a Mac with OS X,"No fun: I cannot save a game. Ever. Or to be correct, a saved game cannot be reloaded - just produces a black screen. In other words you have to play the entire game at once!The not at all helpful support from Aspyr initially just returned standard comments (I am surprised they did not write back: ""have you switched on your computer?"") and eventually they just ignored me."
3,O.K.,The Game is Much to Short!!!!!!I beat the game in a day!!!!Don't think it is bad or anything. you can cast spells catch snithches and save the wizarding world from Lord (You Know Who's) Evil riegn.
2,this game is simple,"this game is SOOOOO fun.. but SOOO easy and short.. i beat this game in 2 days... dont get me wrong... this game is fun. but it gives only 4 hours of gameplay (no strategy guides) the game gta3, gives about 100 hours of gameplay. thats the difference. Every level is wicked easy accept for the one where u sneak down from the tower, and the last level where u fight that ugly person. again, i say u should rent this game, (for ps or ps2), blockbuster gives u a week of rental with ur.... GAMEs FREEDOM PASS!!...rent this game for a week, and beat it in a day."
5,"Great game, but short!","This a great game, especially if you are a Harry Potter fan. My friend played it and she hates Harry Potter, but she liked the game. It makes a great gift for any kid. I loved this game. Great Graphics, of course a great story, and very fun. You even get to play Quidditch! The only bad thing about this game is: Its too short!!! It took me less than a week to beat it, but it's fun enough to play again! A must have for the Harry Potter Fan!!!"
5,Yeah! No more violence!,It is about time the gaming industry put out a game that was packed with all of the spell-binding magical adventure that you get in games like Diablo II without all the blood and guts to go along with it. I have a nephew who is 9 and is obsessed with Diablo II and other games in that genre. He is bored with most games rated for his age. He finally has a game to play that is fun and exciting for him without the blood and guts. We have loved playing Harry Potter. It has kept us on the edge of our seats. The graphics and sounds are wonderful. This game is a must for any child who loves Harry Potter and loves gaming. It's a refreshing change from the typical roll-playing type games. The only thing that would have made the game more fun would have been to make it a multi-player with Harry and his friends. Thanks EA!
4,Shiny.....shiny good....,"Allright, first off, I'm 17 years old AND a girl (GASP! A Female gamer! FLEE!). Unlike most of my generation, however, I caught on to the Harry Potter phenomenon early and wasn't put off by the fact that it was so appealing to younger kids as well. (which means I'm mocked by my friends, but I can slowly convert them...ah yes, the positive ways of using peer pressure....life is good.) The game is no less; crisp graphics, and a storyline that stays wonderfully true to the book make this a must for true fans. The learning curve is swift enough that even young gamers won't have much trouble playing it, but at the same time it's got enough challenge to it that more experience gamers will like it to. The ONLY reason that I haven't given this a full five stars is because I wish it had been more of an RPGm and I'm not much for level games....but then, I only say that because it's so damn good I HAVE to find fault with it. Bravo EA.....you've done well."
4,Even Grandma Can Do It!,"I first played this game with the guidance of my 4 year old grandson and I decided that I wanted one for my computer. I have enjoyed many evenings playing. The graphics need some work, but all in all I think this game is excellent. It is too advanced for young children, they can start to play it, but it is harder for them to advance. This didn't seem to bother my grandson, he was just happy to be a part of Harry Potter."
1,here's the deal,"first a series of books that draws kids AWAY from the computer and TV, and is praised greatly for doing so...and now they're making software and movies.ironic, no?stick to the books."
3,Fun Game For HP Fans,O.K. game. Graphics are good. One bad thing is the game only takes 5hrs. to beat. Voldermort is almost impossible to beat.
3,Half good half bad and too easy,"I played it and it was to easy, because my friend beat it in 3 days. The only good part of it is the qudditch torument. For true gamers don't get it!"
3,ummmm,I found this game years ago on sale for 10 dollars at best buy and I had a gift card that was about to expire so I thought I might check it out. The graphics are realy bad. The controls are preaty bad too. The game was easy at parts like fighting Voldemort I won in no time at all. This game also was good for putting all the challenges at the end. SO over all this game is OK.
4,A Very Enjoyable Game,"When I played this for the first time, I really enjoyed it. This is a very entertaining game with a lot of puzzles, foes, and characters. There are only a few cons that I could see:1. The beginning is a like a scrapbook. What I mean is that you can't play at the Dursley's, Diagon Alley, or even at Platform 9 3/4. This really makes the game shorter. I would have loved to have explored Diagon Alley. Instead, you are taken right to Hogwarts before you can even do anything in the game.2. The graphics aren't the best 3D graphics around, but they are still very nice and vivid.3. The game seems a little short. I wish it could have been a bit longer.Other than that, this game is awesome. I loved the different puzzles and rivals that had to be faced. The game can also be a little difficult at times too, especially the final ""boss"" (yet who doesn't like a challenge?).This would be a great gift for any Harry Potter fan or computer gamer.--M. Turcotte"
4,Much Fun,"The graphics are okay in this game, they could be better...but it's a good start. I liked that you were able to explore the grounds for a little bit. I've had this game for a few years now and I've still enjoyed playing it. If you compare it to the newer Harry Potter PC Games that have come out, it is WAY TOO EASY with the exception of the end part were you have to go through all of the tasks to get to the Voldemort part. I would recommend this game for HARRY POTTER FANS but ALSO FIRST TIME GAMERS."
4,Fun but can get boring....,I have had this game since it came out and I am still stuck on teh Quidditch match. I think it has something to do with my computer because everytime I am close I end up dying. So up until that time this game is fun but once I get there I think I spent 5 months on it and finally gave up! My nephew plays it now and he just like to play for fun. He is actually good at the begining of the game for a 5 year old. If you are thinking of this game is is definately worth the money it is now. I think you will have fun playing it.
4,It's a pretty good game!,This game is very good for Harry Potter fans. I am a Harry Potter fan myself. When I saw this game online I bought it instantly.It turn out to be a pretty good game but the graphics is not that good. Another thing is that Ron and Hemione doesn't stay with you a lot you mostly go by yourself. The game gets harder and harder like when you get chase by a troll or attend lessons. Overall the game is pretty good. I recomend it.
2,Brings shame to the name of Harry Potter!,"Being an avid Harry Potter fan, I bought the game when I first saw it. Now, you would guess an HP game would be amazing, but guess again: it [is horrible]! All the characters are very badly portrayed and the voices are horrible. Sheesh, if I hadn't seen it myself, I'd never have believed Harry Potter could [be] suck so bad. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans are very pointless to collect; all you do is give them to Fred and George who seem to own you! Ron and Hermione are hardly there and them being Harry's best friends, they should definitely be there. All-in-all, I'm very disappointed and I returned the game after a couple of days. Don't buy it unless you want to waste your money!"
2,"Disappointing, to say the least","I agree whole-heartedly with the review titled ""disappointing eye candy"". I have experienced every problem he mentioned and then some. The biggest disappointment overall to me is the fact that it is rated for children age 6 and over. My 6 year old has spent half of the time he's had with the game watching me get through the hard spots of the game for him (and I usually have to make multiple attempts myself.) We have finally given up the game at the point where we have to chase Malfoy on the broomstick and knock him off - it has proven to be an impossible task. My 10 and 8 year olds have not had any better luck than I have. The least Electronic Arts could do is publish a strategy guide to take away some of the frustration. A visually stunning but functionally useless game, in my opinion."
3,Too challenging for younger children (and some adults!),"I consider myself a fairly experienced gamer, but even I had to give up at one point in this game. My daughter became very frustrated, first with herself, then with me, and finally with the game, due to our inability to get past a certain point. We never did get around to finishing the game, and neither of us has any desire to spend many more hours making poor Harry pass out due to our failure.I liked the action, the plot, and the art. However, this game requires superior motor skills and great deductive reasoning, since the game manual is less than helpful. Unless you're purchasing this for a child (or an adult) who is a consummate pro at gaming, I would suggest something a little less challenging."
1,Not worthy of book,"This game is not worthy of the book. I expected something along the line of ""Escape from Horrorland"" based on the R. L. Stine books where there are a series of puzzles and interesting explorations based upon the plot of the book. The plot is irrelevant in this game. This is merely a set of puzzles for finding the classrooms while you collect jelly beans and wizard cards. The old game series Commander Keen did a better job of that.For example, Harry travels from class to class but there really is no classroom set to explore. Just think of the experience if he had been able to explore his Potions classroom.It's obvious that this was a quick marketing attempt to make some money off the book. BORING, BORING, BORING. Shame on you Rowling for allowing this to happen."
4,Pretty good game...,"This is a nice game... But it could use a few improvements. First off: MOUTHS. I wish they had made the mouths on the people move! It looks like the people who made the game were too lazy to make the mouths move.Second: You can't skip cutscenes... You have to sit for a long time watching Fred and George show how to walk on the carpet and pick up a bean.Also, the characters keep changing voices so one second Filch will sound mean and nasty and the next second he'll sound as nice as Dumbledore. Oh yeah, speaking of Dumbledore; he has an AMERICAN ACCENT! ... The game has a very good, easy to follow story and very nice graphics. It's also REALLY fun and challenging. You should get it...but if you don't like the bad stuff I told you about, then get Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets."
5,Family Fun,"My six year old daughter and I play this game daily since she got it for Christmas. I would not reccomend buying it for your children aged 6-7 if you yourself are not able to play with them. There are some very difficult areas that give me a work out at the controls. Even with me running it, she loves every minute! A great game for us to play together!"
4,A little over rated,"For the most part I agree with the other reviews, though one of my irratations with the ""challenges"" such as, with the troll thing, why on earth are there giant creveses in the floor? And for some reason the have it positioned so that you are facing your charactor and you can't see where in God's name you're going and you fall through tiny 2 foot wide holes in the floor. And you stat out where it's fun and then after you faint or whatever a couple of times it starts to junt... you off!"
4,Harry Potter game...fun but challenging for young children,"This game has good graphics, sound quality, and controls to customize viewing. It is fun and draws you in to discover all the wonders and strangeness of Hogwarts School with Fred and George Weasley guiding you through the ""secret passages"" in the castle. As Harry, you explore, attend classes, practice your magic, meet with friends Hermione and Ron, and try and thwart Malfoy. It is a challenging game for younger children because of the control needed to master certain sections of the game. My child is a little younger than the recommended age of 8 and he did get frustrated with the game in a few places. It your child is younger than 8, you will need to stay close to help him/her past the more difficult spots of the game. Don't be surprised if you have a hard time too, yes, I admit it....it's challenging even for adults. However, I will gladly admit that it's fun for adults too."
4,Very Enjoyable :),"I'm an avid fan of the Harry Potter books, so when I recieved the game for Christmas I was really thrilled! The graphics in the game were amazing, and the characters looks and voices were true to the film. Flying on a broomstick and playing Quiddich was a lot of fun and also not too difficult to manage. The different levels were varied and excellent, I got to learn spells, save Hermione from a troll and knock Draco Malfoy off his broomstick (which I must say, was quite an enjoyable thing to do!) The whole game was a lot of fun! The things I didnt like about the game were the fact that the characters mouths didnt move when they spoke, they just tended to flail their arms about when talking. I also found both the beginning and end of the game dissapointing. The start of the game was rushed into, and I was expecting an amazing ending (which I didnt get). Despite that, I still enjoyed the game and would recommend any Harry Potter fan to buy it :)"
4,Great Game,"My name is Patrick, and I am 9 years old. I got Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for Christmas. I had never played an adventure game before, it took me awhile to get used to the controls. I loved it when I got used to it. I have gotten to the last level, but I have not beat it yet. My favorit part is ""sneak up to the tower"". I have gotten frusterated when the fences get in the way of the screen. I don't like that Harry can't move when he is aiming. Overall, I would recommend it."
3,its alright,"I bought this game because i loved the book, but it wasn't that great. At the beginning it is really fun because it is just like harry potter. It is cool because you can go to quidditch practice. But, after a while it starts to get boring because you just have to solve simple problems and to me it wasn't entertaining enough. The graphics are pretty good. If you really like Harry Potter then buy it, but it will get boring after a while."
5,OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"WOW! KNOW THEY'VE GONE VIRTUAL W/ HARRY POTTER! MY, MY, SHOULD I GET IT FOR THE GBA, OR THE PS, OR THE PC? AHHA! I'LL GET IT FOR ALL OF THE ABOVE! I HAVE, OF COARSE,HAVE READ ALL OF THE BOOKS, AM WAITING FOR THE MOVIE, AND NOW I CAN TAKE HIM(HARRY) EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!! I WUZ HOPIN' THEY'D MAKE A VIDEO GAME."
4,Fun...,This game is very fun. I like the part where you have to sneak past Filch.Pros:1. Very interactive2. Difficult at times and easy at times3. Cheats make the game fun (go to gamewinners.com for cheats)Con:1. you can only follow one path. You can barely explore.2. wizard cards are easy to find.
1,So So Game,"Besides having a really bad graphics engine, completely linear, and absolutely boring. Overall this game is a 1 Star. This reminds me of very fast to market attempt at a RPG. The plot is very thin, and the playability is boring at best. Do not buy this game, unless you have a 4 or 5 year old that wants to play it. Anybody over 5 will be bored. I am surprised that TK Rowling even allowed this feeble attempt to get to the market place. My god, their mouths don't even move when they talk - Gimme a break!"
2,Kid's game...I wouldn't buy it,"If you're a gamer, don't buy it, you won't like it. It doesn't have the widespread appeal of the books and is suitable only for children. It's too easy....."
1,waste of money,"Sure wish I knew before I ordered this perfume that there was no returns! It smelled terrible! Must have been on the shelves way too long. Talk about throwing money away! Thats exactly what I did, threw it in the garbage!"
1,Peee-U!,"Yuck scent. No wonder it was priced so cheaply. But, if you savor heavy orientals, maybe you'll like it. I immediately resold the product on Craig's List at a loss."
5,My grandma loves this perfume.,My Grandma has always used Joop (20+ years). I can't wait for her to open this for Christmas! This makes a perfect gift for older women.
2,Disappointment,"The entire transaction of this sale went extremely well! I was very excited to receive the package in just a few days. However, I was disappointed in the product itself. I do not believe this to be the authentic Joop Eau De Toilette fragrance. I usually purchase my fragrances overseas and the Joop I get in the UK is definately not the same as the fragrance I recently purchased online. The UK purchase has more definate ""tones"", much stronger/longer lasting qualities.I'm not saying ""do not purchase"". I just prefer the UK's version of Joop."
2,leaked out,the bottle was half empty when I got it.You need to find a better way to ship perfume.Wouldn't order perfume from you again.
1,Smelt Old,"This perfum smelt abrasive and old like it had been sitting around for awhile. It was so harsh I didn'tfeel like I could wear it. Not like an expensive perfume you just received. A total waste of money. I will not be buying from this seller again, whatsoever!!!"
1,Disappointed - Such poor quality,I was very disappointed not only with the quality of the content but also the fact that the discs are recordable blue discs. I thought the latter was limited to fake duplicates that are sold in China & Pakistan.Amazon should remove these products off their lists and get better quality products to safeguard their reputation and integrity.
1,I could put it down....,"I had a hard time even reading the first couple of chapters of this book. The story opening is so bizarre, it turns you off the book. The characters are not believable and the supernatural plot is just weird."
2,Disjointed,"The best that can be said is that it was disjointed. I couldn't follow the mystery subplot, the heroine was self absorbed, and although you knew who the hero was, Ms. Cameron did not make the choice obvious."
4,Lost in 7B!!,"Oh Stella!! There is quite definitely a wonderful story here trying desperately to get out - much like your obnoxious ghost Spivey, but neither quite make it. Hunter and Sibyl are clearly a great match and their scenes together are extraordinarily sensual (more information on his amazing ""talent"" please?); unfortunately, the confusion that permeates their affair also permeates the rest of the story and makes it hard to classify this as a couldn't-put-it-down-er. For those of us who love the adventures of these eccentric folks it was a must-buy, but for those who are just finding Stella Cameron, I'd recommend ""More and More"" or ""Sheer Pleasures"" to whet their appetite, not this warm-hearted muddle!"
2,Disappointing Read for a Cameron fan,I was excited about this book because I had read the other books in this series (More & More and All Smiles) and was looking forward to reacquainting myself with the characters. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. The story was bizarre (which is not always a bad thing) and confusing. Sibyl Smiles wants a baby but doesn't want a husband so naturally she turns to her friend and neighbor Hunter Llyod. The conflicts from this situation are not well explored and there is another confusing side plot involving Hunter's involvement in a high profile trial. There was too much going on and the resolution of the conflicts don't make sense. Overall I ended the book with a sense of puzzlement over what had just taken place. Stella Cameron usually hits with me but this was a rare miss.
1,"Skip it, run, don't even consider it.","This book was terrible. The first out of hundreds I never finished. The setting had potential and I love steamy love scenes, but these were just...gross, frustrating and weird. Way too graphic for even this genre. And Ghost inhabitants that sort of act as narrators, I skipped those before I realized I was wasting my time with the book altogether. Our time is just too valuable. Really, skip this one. It was my first by this author, and unfortunately, now she's on my black list."
1,Boring!,This was so..... boring that I would throw it down and read other books. I did finally finish it but would never buy another book by Stella Cameron. The editor counted on the author's name selling this book not the quality of the work. I would classify this book as more soft-core porn than a historical romance. I don't believe even the most forward thinking women of the period would sit around with friends describing either the physical attributes or prowess of their men....
1,7b is a disappointment,Actually put this book down after about 4 days of trying to read - kept getting angry with all the subplots and inside jokes and general lack of focus in the writing. Who edited this thing?Read one of the previous books in the series and don't remember this amount of frustation with the ghost sub plot which is way to obtrusive in the book.Have resigned myself to skimming through the final pages to find out how it ends.......
3,"Tedious, disappointing reading","Try as I might, I simply could not get into this book. Granted, Ms. Cameron is an excellent writer, but I personally felt she used her talent rather sparingly in this venture. I was more then halfway through before I started to feel like it wasn't a chore reading this book. Maybe it was because I simply found it so improbable that a 28 year old spinster in the early 1800's would consider having sex only to procur a baby. Somehow, the ghost that makes an appearance regularly throughout the book seemed more believable. Come to think of it, I think the comments of the ghost, Septimus Spivey, is what kept me slogging along to the end. He was very entertaining! Despite my lack of enthusiasm for this particular book, I still wouldn't hesitate to pick up another Stella Cameron novel."
2,very interesting,"This book is fascinating as an example of early psychoanalytic treatment, but I disagree with so much of what goes on that I can't give it a positive rating. The appalling power dynamic in the text shows just how much Dora herself matters in all of this. Again, if it's being read purely as a historical text (or as a guide for how NOT to analyze a situation or treat someone), then that's great. But as anything more than that it fails."
4,Pint-Sized Epic,"This is a wonderful little tale that is categorized as children's literature but that need not be overlooked by adult audiences. I am not sure that the categorization is entirely correct, at least by modern standards - given the ""mature themes"" touched on in this book (lusty inn winches, drunkeness, grim executions, murder, pillaging, and singing in the round - ok, the last one was a joke). Hawes weaved a wonderfully intricate story of piracy on the high seas against a richly developed backdrop of England in the age of Charles and Cromwell, and delivered with a lavish English vernacular of the same era (or at least that's the impression). The latter element made this sometimes difficult for my kids to follow when I read this aloud to them, but no honest child can resist the swashbuckling twists and turns of this Newbury award winning classic. I don't think this is better than Treasure Island, but it ranks close."
2,Not my cuppa tea,"Philip Marsham signed on to work on a ship. Before he had traveled far, however, pirates on the ship kill the ship's captain and part of the crew and take the ship over. Philip has no choice but to stay on the ship and help the pirates, as much as he is able, to carry on with their plan to take over other ships. Finally Philip has an opportunity to escape from the ship onto an island, but he cannot survive long there. He finds another ship and has hope to convince the captain of this ship that he was not a willing member of the pirate crew and that he will be allowed to travel on the ship to home.It was all I could do to keep myself reading this book. ""Just a hundred more pages,"" I told myself. ""Keep on going. It's a Newbery and you have to read it if you are going to actually read all the Newbery winners."""
4,Pirate Tale Still a Page Turner,I'm a 32 year old female and found this book to be a real page turner. I have never read a pirate tale before and this one wasn't at all disappointing. My husband would pick it up from time to time and read it to me. He got into it and felt inspired to rent some pirate movies. This book seems like it would scare children because it gives such graphic details about how the pirates killed men. It was a dark and gruesome story. I recommend it to anyone that wants to read an old fashioned story about adventures that happen out on the sea. Watch out for the Rose of Devon!
