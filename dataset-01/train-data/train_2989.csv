3,Needs better directions to use it,I specifically bought this to clean suede shoes but the instructions were not clear and did not quite clean well.
3,Worked,"Took a couple minutes to figure out how to get it to apply, but once I did it went on easily. My boots are now waterproof!My only complaint is that it discolored the boots somewhat. I had read that the product does that, but mostly on lighter colors. These boots are a pretty dark brown, and now they have a couple darker splotches on them. Its not too noticeable though. I wouldn't recommend this on any other color than black."
1,Messed up the texture and color of my boots,I used this product as directed and my boots ended up with a stiff horrible texture and the color definitely changed. I would not recommend this product.
5,Galoshes? We don't need no stinking galoshes!,"I put this stuff on 3 pairs of leather boots that I have. One pair is just a nice pair of nubuck town boots. I can go to the bar or the store or the movies when it's raining and know my feet will be dry when i get there. Even if I have to splash through a puddle or two.Another pair of boots that I treated are my hiking boots. Granted that during one especially heavy thunderstorm/tornado my feet ended up getting wet(it was probably because my entire body was soaked), for the rest of my hike I was fine. Sloshing across a small creek or getting in a light shower was no problem. You can really watch the water just bead up and roll off. Nikwax is kind of like Rain-X for your shoes.This stuff is easy to use and a great value. Your feet will thank you."
1,Doesn't Work in Real Life Conditions,"I am often out early in the morning walking in wet grass, bird watching. I purchased a brand new pair of Merrell shoes made of Nubuck and decided to waterproof them after coming home the first day, to find that the water soaked through the Nubuck and made both my leather orthotic and socks wet. So I bought this stuff and followed the directions exactly. After I put it the stuff on, I waited for it to dry. Then I sprinkled some water on the shoes and it looked as if was going to work, the water beaded up. However, today I was out in wet grass and the water penetrated the Nubuck as before, causing my orthotic and socks to get wet again. It may work when water is dribbled on it, but in real life conditions it is unsatisfactory."
1,DON'T BUY!!!,"I recently purchased this item, unwrapped the package and then followed the instructions for the footwear cleaner gel. Apparently, you have to 'Press the sponge applicator' to break the seal to release the gel. I did that, but no gel comes out. After spending about 10 minutes, shaking, pressing and squeezing to get the gel out - no luck. Since it is unwrapped I cannot return it so it was a waste of $15!"
2,worked well... at first,"I normally am a big fan of nikwax products, and the cleaner certainly did a great job of removing the stubborn salt stains that had accumulated on my nubuck shoes, but the waterproofer was a disappointment. It worked great at first, with the shoes repelling snow and stains well for the first few days, but they soon became susceptible again. I reapplied, but I had already used over half the bottle for the first application."
1,Stained my Best Suede Boots,"I attempted to use the cleaner to remove some small spots on a very expensive pair of brown sued boots. The cleaner neither removed the spots but instead stained the suede. I took the boots to a very reputable shoe repair shop in New York City. $35.00 later and the stain remained. They told me the only thing they could do at that point would be to dye the boots black but even then the stain would show and instead of a beautiful pair of reddish brown suede boots with a obvious and unremovable stain from the cleaner, I would have black suede boots with the same stain only darker. Really love these boots and very much regret using this product on them."
2,Nikwax vs Snoseal,"Initially, I was talked into Nikwax for reasons such as, ""It's better for your shoes and less damaging"", ""It doesn't attract dirt"", etc. I followed the application instructions and my leather shoes still got soaked in the Seattle rains and puddles. I had another pair of leather shoes and decided to use Snoseal (the stuff I always used for my hiking boots), Snoseal is still my favorite. My shoes have stayed dry in Seattle rains and this week they are surviving the scary puddles of New York when I can't avoid them."
1,took too long,This was the worst thing I could have done it cost more for shipping than the product was worth for a 1.99 item it cost 6.99 and took 4 weeks to arrive..I will never use this vendor again
4,Great nature writing and commentary on contemporary life,"Hubbell has a genuinely unique insight into nature that is fresh and original while her writing is well crafted. Being a beekeeper of over ten years, I was attracted to the book for that reason but came away with much more. Hubbell's musings on life in general and her backwoods alternative to the modern drum on the digital age is a good escape. An insightful read for anyone interested in a deeper perspective on one aspect of rural life. Enjoy."
5,Fact-filled and enjoyable,"This book is a perfect introduction to the wonders, and challenges, of beekeeping. It is a personal account, and so it reads as easily as a novel. Facts embed so smoothly you realize how much you have learned only later. The account covers every base I could imagine and, even more important, it tells you what questions to ask yourself as well as others as you go along."
4,What's not to like.,"Admittedly I've few favorite writers who're women. Sue Hubble is an exception. I'm facinated by the person she emotes through her writing. This is not just a book of bees. It is instead a narrative of life in tune with the natural world. Sue Hubble is accurate in her observations and true in her depictions. And, I am a beekeeper."
1,Sub-Par Book,"The author makes to great of attempt to write a novel instead of trying to teach beekeeping. If you already know beekeeping and are bored, you might like this book. On the other hand, if you are a beginner, this book is not for you despite the claims made by the book and its author. I would recomend Beekeeping: A Practical Guide by Richard Bonney or The New Starting Right With Bees. Frankly, these are more clear, have more pictures to help describe what they are talking about, and are an easier reference. When I read books I quite often forget stuff, so I like to be able to go back and reread certain parts on the topic. Since Sue Hubell makes too great of effort to make her book into a novel, trying to review a subject is nearly impossible."
4,"Good, but...","This is a good CD of the 10th, but my expectations were a bit too high. I think the DePriest/Helsinki recording and performance is slightly better."
2,Cheaply made,My 4 year old son was looking forward to getting this batmobile so much and then as soon as we opened the package one of the side wings immediately quit working. He hadn't had a chance to be rough with it at all. Now he can only play with the car with the wings out since one side won't stay retracted. The sound effects are great but the car is apparently so cheaply made that it breaks with the slightest provocation (or without any provocation!). This is not ok for the price we paid.
4,Lisa's Review,My son loves his batmobile. I had to get him the action figure to ride in the car too. He thinks that it's the best toy ever!
1,DON'T BUY THIS! SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"I can't even imagine that these other reviewers got the same product we got - but this IS it. I paid $40 for this, including the Batman figure (which is not even sold with the toy!) and it fell apart almost as soon as my son opened it. We lost both missles on Christmas day (and there are NO replacements) so the fun part of the toy was gone. The plastic top fell off in less than a day, and in less than a week, the retraction feature stopped working. I wouldn't even sell this at a yard sale for a quarter, and I see here that Amazon is now selling it for $239 PLUS $20 shipping. PLEASE, PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY! This is the worst Batmobile EVER! And my little Batman lover simply doesn't have a Batmobile now, because I can't bear the thought of losing $$$ again for this catastrophe."
1,Terribly disappointing,"I'm sorry, I don't what to say beyond I found this book terrible disappointing. It was simplistic, provided no useful information or insight, and most importantly seems quite useless as a handbook."
5,Track Listing,1. Robbing and stealing2. Dancing with the devil3. Fallen4. Don't try to hide5. Visions in my dreams6. Bloody tears7. Simplify8. Messiah
4,Blast from the Past,"I first visited West Germany in 1978. I lived there as a student in 1980 and 1981, then visited breifly again in 1985. The divided Germany is the only one I have known. When I was in Germany, the DDR was a vivid reality.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I recently saw the film, Good Bye, Lenin and was inspired to pick this book up off of my shelf where it had stood gathering dust since I bought it at around the time of the collapse of the DDR.That got me going, so I'm reading Germany's Other Half by Franz von Nesselrode, published in 1963. It's interesting, too. The first chapter is titled ""The DDR Is Here To Stay"". Well, maybe not."
5,This book Sings !,"This book will make me a smarter parent. I am amazed at how this book blends the practical, the scientific and the artistic into common sense. I am not a fan of Classical music, but this book has helped me understand more about the healthy qualities of music.Mr. Campbell gives me the evidence I need to show my school district that music classes must be included in every child's schoolday. The book is well referenced and gives many ways to help children improve their minds with music. This book sings the heart, the brain and the body of music!"
1,two sided mirror,The mirror developed a small crack within two months of use. I contacted the manufacturer and received a brief dismissing response indicating that they will not honor any warranty. The have also not responded to my follow up email.Unhappy and disappointed!
4,Very nice makeup mirror!,As I age my eyes really appreciate the 5X magnification in this mirror! It really is wonderful to see all the details of my eye makeup.
5,Love this Mirror!,I have bought 2 of these. I got 1 for myself last year and another for my mother this year. Works great.
1,"""Lighted"" vanity is a joke.","The light does not really light up anything. The mirror is huge and bulky and I STILL can't see anything in it. Buy something, anything else."
4,Great!,"I use this mirror almost everyday. For anyone over 50 that has the bifocal thing going on you need one of these. I save a fortune now being able to do my own eyebrows instead of getting them waxed all the time. Great magnification. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the light could be a bit brighter. Fortunately I have good light in my bathroom so it doesn't matter much to me, but it could be a problem if you have low light."
2,Make up mirror,"If you want to see your face while putting on make up I would not suggestthis iem. The mirror itself is about 6 1/2"".If Women like to put their make up and check th entire face while doing so,this is not the mirror to purchase.Very dissatisfyed with mirror size"
3,"Not exactly the ""RIGHT LIGHT""","It sure is pretty, setting on my dressing table..but my finished make-up looks quite different when I see myself in a mirror somewhere else throughout the day. The lighting is a bit off in my opinion. It appears to have a golden/yellow cast which throws off colors. I do love the 5X side, very helpful. I will use it, but only with the light turned off. I just can't get past the strange color of light!!"
2,Not worth the money,"This is the second lighted mirror I've owned. This one was twice the price of my first mirror and not nearly as nice. The mirror is rather small in size and the light is not as bright as it should be. One needs to be in a very well lit room when using the light. Recommend to others that are contemplating this purchase, look for a less expensive one!"
1,Wow..Looks like a high school cinematography project,"This movie was amongst the worst I've ever seen in my entire life, and that includes several terrible Steven Seagal generic-CG stealth fighter movies.Seriously, do not even CONSIDER renting this movie. Save your money, time, and the disappointment. If you see ANY positive reviews on this movie it's either someone unfortunately involved in the making of this film or it's an intended joke. One look at the first CG'd monster and you'll laugh. I fast-forwarded through to see if there was any substance to the film, but it remained shallow throughout and at one point even repeated the entire opening scene in the middle of the movie. There is no cinematic quality here. Zero. Might as well have been filmed by students just discovering how to use a video camera and edit films. How did this make Redbox?!"
1,Everyone is right.,"Enough said. I NEVER write movie reviews, but this one was so bad I had to see if someone was enjoying it. Maybe I was missing something. Nope. Terrible in every way."
1,Absolutely hooooooorible,How some dork filmed his buddies playing dungeons and dragons and turned it into a movie that got produced is one of the greatest mysteries of all time. Save your $1 it's not worth it.
1,what a waste,I agree with tmygun. Don't waste your time. This is just plain terrible. And the blu ray just highlights to poor quality. Not worth the $2 rental.
1,Dont Bother,Watched about first 3 minutes and saw the CGI monster and knew this was going to be bad. Story drug on for 20 minutes and finally just forwarded through the rest of the movie. Pretty much horrible.
2,"Interesting, once.","In this recording, Bach's Cello Suites are performed on double bass rather than cello. If you are already familiar with the music, the resulting change in timbre creates an interesting effect. Unfortunately, the novelty ends there. The underlying performance is not especially compelling, and the bassist has a habit of using ponderously slow tempos that make the music sound belabored."
5,Book destined to endure,"Despite Eli Chiprout's critical review of The Design Inference, readers can be assured that Dembski stands by his calculation and is prepared to defend it. Chiprout's chief objection seems to be that Dembski's conditional independence condition founders when human agents get into the act. Chiprout may register his complaint, but we should all note that this book and the theories it puts forth have been thoroughly vetted: it was Dembski's doctoral dissertation, it went through a grueling review process with Cambridge University Press, and the author sent preprints to probably fifty or so scholars and academics for comment. No one, and I mean **NO ONE**, corrected Dembski on what Chiprout suggests is an obvious oversight. Long after the dust of criticism settles, The Design Inference will surely stand as an important and enduring advancement in our understanding of the theory of Intelligent Design."
2,Mathematical symbols do not cover all sins,"Is there a shortage of mathematical reviewers that pseudo-mathematical jargon should be published as mathematics? Looking at publications, not many mathematicians have picked up on this ""revolutionary"" approach to detecting design, while in contrast non-randomness has seen many fruitful works and discussions among mathematicians and information theorists. Mathematics is not sociology and the reaction of the community is an immediate judgement of merit since equations can be reviewed unambiguously by all. In contrast the ambiguities and vagueness of this book are rampant. The merits of this book are its mentions of decent mathematical works."
1,Dembski's folly,"Borrow the book. Read it. Examine the centerpiece, Dembski's Explanitory Filter. Try to run a two-part process, such as evolution's variation and natural selection through it. It can't be done, yet Dembski claims his filter proves evolution can't work! Pure rubbish."
2,Needs to be rethought,"The book is a bold attempt at a design inference but has some fundamental logical and scientific flaws. Primarily, mathematical nonrandomness has been known in the probability theoretical community for some time now and cannot be extended in this way to intentionality.Please see a complete review of the book at the page members.aol.com/echiprt/design.htm in order to go through the major argumentation of this thesis and see why it is flawed.Eli Chiprout, research staff member, IBM research division"
1,Sole came apart,"This is the second pair which I purchased for my son to wear to work at a restaurant. Order was placed on December 6, 2006. He came home today with the right sole completely apart from the rest of the shoe after about 5 weeks of wear. I purchased the first pair about 1 1/2 years ago and they wore satisfactorily over time while wearing other shoes but not worth the approximate $90.00 paid back then. Got this second pair on sale. Definite quality issues. Amazon wants me to fight with the manufacturer since it's been past their 30 days return policy limit. I am disputing them on this issue and will dispute them through my credit card company if necessary."
1,bad mac toe,"it did not last me for one week ,the sole came off ,it's not worth the money.wasted.,i need my money back or replacement with something else."
4,Talk about great anime based on fighting games!,"This is one of the greatest animes in the world, at least for me. I for one liked the battle with Donovan and Bishamon, very intriging. I would certainly recommend this for all dark stalkers fans."
5,My kids LOVE this book.,"We actually got this book Free from KBYU at a pregame tailgate before the BYU vs UNR football game, and didn't think much about it that day. Got it home and gave it to the kids. they wanted us to read it to them that night, and then every night there after for the next month... totally fun book. The kids love it and it isn't bad for Parents either.It is part of the regular bedtime book routine now."
1,Waste of Money!!!,"Worked great for about 3 days. Then the Motor started losing strength and it would start playing slow tempo. There are adjustment screws on the unit,but UNDERNEATH!!! It was difficult trying to keep it level while playing, while tweaking adjustments with a micro screwdriver.Once Adjusted it now plays normal speed but will slow intermittently. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! The return regiment was so complex, not to mention you have to pay for the return shipping.In the end I just ate the $50 dollars. Next time im going to suck it up and get a pro, they are just $150 total but seems well worth it."
1,Piece of Garbage,"This item is an all around piece of garbage. After about 3 months of light use, it is stuck in 45 rpm mode. I sometimes use my thumb to slow down the player to 33 rpm mode. Don't buy this piece of garbage, unless you like owning garbage, in which case this is right your alley, the Garbage Alley. I wouldn't even give this to a bum, because I would feel bad about it."
3,Great Buy... AT-PL50 Beltdrive Turntable,This is a great Buy for the money. Works great and easy to install. This Turntable has a booster/ Amplifer build in so you can listen to your albums with a set of head phones if you don't have a sound system to connect to. There is a swith on the unit under the turntable deck that will allow it utilize the amplifer/ or not.
2,Piece of junk,"I was initially very satisfied with the product. However, after using it to record 4 albums to my computer, it started giving feedback through the inline feed. Now, it is probably worthless."
1,Had 2 defective tables!!! Buyer Beware.,"My girlfriend just ordered this for my birthday, and although it looks like a nice entry level player and the price was right, it went right back to Amazon... twice! The first one had no sound coming out of the right channel and the second one i received for the exchange must have had a screwed up motor because the speed was waaaaaay to fast, no matter what it was set on. Big disappointment... don't even bother. On a positive note, Amazon's return process was super speedy!!!"
2,Slightly disappointed,"It doesn't play well with my stereo system. It is either too amplified or too low for the switch options under the turntable. Other than that, it seems to be a nice turntable and seems to work fine."
3,You get what you pay for,"This is an entry-level, belt-driven turntable. The AT-PL50 does boast a number of attractive features including a switchable built-in pre-amp, a pre-installed cartdrige, a dust cover, automatic playback and return, and, of course, the budget-minded price tag.My main gripe with this unit is the fact that it does not handle imperfections in the vinyl very well. The bulk of my collection is comprised of second-hand purchases, many of which are in average condition. These albums play without skipping on my father's 30-year-old JVC direct-drive turntable but they regularly skip on the AT-PL50. And since this unit does not offer an adjustable counterweight for the tone arm, there's no way to add weight to the tone arm other than to tape a coin to the head or tie a metal coil to the tone arm.In retrospect, I wish I had ponied up for a more trustworthy direct-drive turntable."
4,great for the money,"Tired of looking at my LP collection stored in boxes I wanted something inexpensive to hear them again. My home theater system didn't have a turntable hookup so I figured this would go the way as my records, than I discovered the AT-Pl50. It was easy to hook-up with the system (you will probably need RCA cable extensions). The sound for the money is great! I recommend this highly if your LP's are secondary to CD's."
5,Audio Technica AT-PL50 Belt Drive Turntable,"Audio Technica AT-PL50 Belt Drive TurntableTurntable is nicely designed, functioning perfectly, and arrived promptly well packaged. I'm more than satisfied this product."
4,You get what you pay for.,This is a very simple record player worth the $40 some dollars. Its a great record player to get started on.
3,Not bad for the price,"Audio Technica AT-PL50 Belt Drive TurntableI purchaed the PL50. First the product discription is misleading. This turntable works but it will not last. The only saving thing is that it has a built in pre amp, which I did not need. You would do better to spend a few more dollars a buy a direct drive turntable."
1,What a drag!,"This turntable should not get a single star because it is definitely not recommended. Unfortunately, no star is not a choice. After having spent some time installing it, one reason being that the cord from the turntable to the amplifier is very short, we started playing some records only to find out that the drag is horrific. And since we obviously have unpacked the turntable, we have no recourse but are stuck with an $75 item that cannot be used."
1,Perfdormance of Audio Technica AT-PL50 Belt Drive Turntable,"There was no problem with the turntable, except the sound was very poor, distorted and muddy. I thought it had to be the cartridge, and so stated in my reply to you.I thought perhaps you would provide me with a new cartridge, instead I was offered a 15% discount. I could not tolerate the sound, so that was not acceptable. I have quite a collection of records 33 and 45's. Some of them are in fair condition but the reproductio was very poor.I have ordered several items on the net and that was the first return. so I don't think it was my problem.Thank you,Robert Sanders"
4,Great for the price,"Is this turntable top of the line? Of course not. Is it the best turntable available in the under $150 range? Definitely. If you are an ""audiophile"" you're not even likely considering this turntable. If you're someone who has an old vinyl collection like me and wants to listen to it casually, then this will be the best $75 you'll ever spend.Unlike most cheap turntables this one has a metal platter and metal tone arm. The construction is pretty rugged for the price, too. I've not noticed any of the speed problems others have noted. The real bonus of this turntable is that it comes with a built-in pre amp that can be turned off or on as you wish. Overall this is a great turntable for the price and will be perfect for most people looking for an inexpensive turntable."
2,"""Skip"" this ReTurntable","Wow, the reviews below about skipping are dead on. I've tried to convert about 10 albums so far and only two played w/out skipping. This is totally unacceptable for vinyl that is in good shape. I'm not an audio-phile so the average sound quality is fine and the pre-amp is fantastic. I don't know if this needs a better stylus, but more likely the tone arm just needs to be heavier. Too bad it can't be adjusted. FYI, I took the same albums that skipped to my 20-year old cheapo Kenwood and they played fine at the same spots that skipped on the Audio-Technica (my old turntable won't play songs near the center label, that's why I bought this one).I give this TT two stars for the two albums that actually played w/out skipping. I was trying to save money, but I would have gladly paid more to avoid the hassle I'm going to have to go through to get these skipping songs to play correctly (which will be bringing out my old TT just to convert the ""bad"" songs)."
3,Good for it's price,"Does what it says, gives you basic record playing ability, with NO adjustments possible except for 7 or 12 inch disk, and 33 1/3 or 45 rpm. Has a fancy rubberband for a drive belt.Adequate for the price, don't expect anything fancy tho. Selling points are that it's cheap and has a line out capability. Drawbacks, no tonearm adjustments, no suspension, no anti-skate/bias/speed/etc adjustments."
4,Great for the price,"This player is great for the price. I have not experienced any problem with the sound. It has a nice metal platter with rubber pad, most players in this price range will cheapen it with a plastic platter with felt pad. For those on a budget and who want to just play their records and maybe record a few, this is a great buy. Professionals, or those with a giant record collection might want something a little more."
1,Frustrating,"It's a good price for a turntable with a pre-amp, but this thing skips an awful lot. Even on a brand new record it was skipping, which is very frustrating."
1,It won't work for me either!,I can't get it to work either. I spent several days working with tech support but it just won't let me sign in to any site.
2,ONLY FOR WINDOWS XP,If you have Vista you need the newer version of this product available at the official site or in stores that is VISTA compatible. I need to return mine to Amazon untried.
1,Want to waste money and time? This is the product for you!,"I purchased this on a whim at CompUSA which was going out of business so the price was much less than full retail listed elsewhere, which is good because that meant I wasted much less money.As I do extensive online banking and other financial transactions the idea seemed like a good one. I also liked the idea of being able to take it with me on vacation, plug into say a relative's pc and perform transactions without having to worry about all the ids (prior I used a password manager and thus was limited to home pc).Anyhow I just gave up after working on this for 2 days (I am a systems programmer by occupation and no newbie to computers / software).PROS: It does protect access to your websites.CONS: You cannot even get into yours."
3,Alright,"Warning. This DVD could be a waste of your time, or maybe you'll like it...it truly depends on how long you can stand to watch Carter Beauford and Vic play together in the studio. I don't find Zenergy (one of their showcased songs) to be too great of a song in the first place...however, some of the improv stuff that these two guys do is entertaining. If you desire some Vic dialogue material, there are added features on the DVD where Vic talks a long time and even answers questions. In addition to dialogue in the bonus material, there is a video of his performance at Bass Day 2000. He performs an original song that he would later incorporate into the next Flecktones CD (Little Worlds). This product wasn't too beneficial for me, but if you're a die hard Victor Wooten fan, then you'll probably be satisfied with it."
4,Making natural milk soap,The book explaned well how to make the soap but the ingredience were not easy to find. I guess I wanted a recipe that would be easier to use.
4,Not as helpful as I'd hoped,Just not real extensive info. Not as helpful as I'd hoped. Transaction went fine. Just not impressed with the book itself.
3,Meh.,"I was not overly impressed with this book when compared to other soapmaking and milk soapmaking books. I did not find the information to be quite as accurate as others, and the recipes were not as varied or interesting as other books I've read. Whenever I want to make a batch of milk-based soap, I never pull this book out. But, I like to have a collection of sources available, so it's been doing a great job on my bookshelf! :-)"
4,XX Century Science and the men who made it happen....,"This book summarizes the life, adventures and discoveries of some of the best brains in the first half of the XX century.An additional benefit of this book is providing an overview of several scientific discoveries and part of the relationship that they have between them. It introduces information on some major scientific achievements that are worth to be known.I would rewrite the title. Better forget Hitler's name, he is not so important."
5,Very Handy For Webmasters,"A very handy book for anybody with a Buffy related website. My site (www.buffy.xs3.com) was dull dreary etc. etc. (My ego can't handle anymore ragging :) I got this book, I had all the info I needed to write quality reviews on the charactors, monsters and episodes in the show. Even if you are websiteless, this book has hours and hours of entertaining reading. (depending on how slow you can read)"
3,Will stick with you,"If you like the Beach Boys, you may find it hard to like this album off the bat. However, silly lyrics in some of the tracks mixed with dancing harmonies and that ""not repeated anywhere else"" Beach Boy essence make this an album that will stick with you for years to come."
4,Bag Boy NXO Deluxe Organizer Cart Bag,The club organizer is great. It is tiered for easy locating of clubs. A little concerned with the grip lock tech as it is not very nice to my WinnGrips (soft). Having the putter tubes on both sides of the bag has been helpful as has been the drink pouch. I would have preferred a smaller drink puch to make way for a small pouch for tees on the front. All in all though I'm very satisfied with the purchase and would recommend the bag to anyone perhaps with the exception of soft wrap-type grips.
4,Bag Boy NXO Deluxe Organizer Golf Cart Bag,"Great bag for organization of clubs. Plenty of pockets for pack rats. Only problem is the putter tube on the left side of the bag, it keeps coming loose if you are not very careful when putting bag on cart."
2,"The good ""grip lok"", the bad ""grip Lok""","Very nice bag, well made and lots of pockets. I find it difficult to insert the club in the bag and just as difficult to get it out. A royal pain, you can have my bag for cheap!"
5,artist community and college---library book,"MARTIN DUBERMAN 6/6-1930.Black Mountain Artist Community and College NC. Book3/13/2009.....ART was the main subject.Experimental. Closed after 24 yrs in 1957. (1933)Never had more than 1,200 students.*****a grand WONDERFUL place*****MANY FAMOUS PEOPLE WERE STUDENTS THERE AND THEY HADMANY FAMOUS PEOPLE AS LECTURERS.All was not calm and there was MINOR problems among somemembers. NEVER enough $$$$.A very VERY interesting-historical book......GOOD PHOTOS.bbpokc ok63retired"
1,Mirror mirror on the wall,The author rated this book with its own title---BAD !!!!! It calls into question the intellectual status ascribed to Fussell. Caveat emptor.
4,Almost as Funny as Class,"Paul Fussell is so sarcastic and fabulous that I want to adopt him. His other book, Class, is the best book of all time for people with ""enquiring minds"". However, I started to feel silly carrying the same worn book to places where I was held captive: airplaines, hair salons, other people's cars, etc., so I bought the book, BAD. It is clearly an addendum to Class, and it makes me laugh out loud almost as much. NO ONE SHOULD CONSIDER THEMSELVES A TRUE AMERICAN, until they understand both Class and BAD! (Dear Mr. Fussell, please write much, much more before you go to that Great Editor in the Sky. We have current problems which need addressing!)"
3,An interesting collection of short essays,"Paul Fussell's book, Bad or the Dumbing of America, has many good points. I do not know if he intended this book to be a short collection of essays on topics about things that could be bad, or if this was intended to be a full out discussion about things that are bad. The concept of America becoming dumber almost slips from my mind as I read the book.What I do like is his insight, and jabs he is willing to make at many institutions. For example, I really enjoyed his pokes at the restaurant industry, and how your waiter tries to upsell you on everything at the meal. I liked the commentary on when you go to a nice hotel, and the staff there seems far more upscale than the hotel itself.I wouldn't say this book is bad, or that it is good. I feel many points in this book are quite good infact. I strugged with the short essay/chapters in the book, and if I was to daw the conclusion that many institutions were trying make America Dumber."
3,almost too entertaining,"This book -- by the same Paul Fussell who wrote ""Poetic Meter and Poetic Form,"" a classic in the field of poetry -- is almost TOO hilarious, in the same way that audiences would laugh profusely at a play of George Bernard Shaw's without realizing the seriousness that lay underneath. He indicts just about everything that is phony in American society -- which is to say, he indicts just about everything in American society, period. This book is out of print? Well, that should prove something.... It's an entertaining book, but I wouldn't give it a ""10,"" for then I would be doing exactly what Fussell condemns."
3,"An entertaining read, but...","The guy's a curmudgeon, albeit an entertaining one. All right, it's fun to diss waiters who tell you they'll be right back with your drink (to paraphrase: ""of course you will, it's your JOB, now do it and shut up!"") and it's fun to beat up on corporations and other big organizations that foist BADness upon the public. On the other hand, we wouldn't GET so much crap if we as a nation didn't place such an emphasis on price (bargain-hunters looking for low price at the expense of service, selection and quality; connoiseurs buying anything costly for prestige). The purveyors of BAD are merely catering to a ready audience. Mostly the book comes off as yet another rant about how the younger generation doesn't respect tradition and is leading society to Hell in a handbasket, a topic that was covered adequately by a certain Greek philosopher some centuries ago. Also, is it just me, or are nearly all his BAD politicians Republicans"
3,We have met the enemy & he is us.,"Professor Fussell enjoys railing against snobs & elitist. It is very evident, he is one. This audio version starts out hilariously but after a while turns into an angry rant: about everything. It is not the level of the Dennis' Leary & Miller & it is not focused. But it is still funny. Sometimes I think I was laughing at him not just his material. Not much in his world is bad. It is BAD. We all laugh, somtimes at ourselves, we deal, & most of us are happy. Professor Fussell is sad. Or is that SAD?"
3,Bad but not BAD,"Morris Berman makes reference to Fussell's BAD, or the Dumbing of America in his treatise for monastic preservation of our culture, The Twilight of American Culture. I was inspired by Berman's text and so sought out Fussell's. It's been a long time since I heard Dennis Miller or George Carlin ""rant,"" but Fussell's book reminded me of a pretentious version of their work. Not that he didn't make me laugh aloud several times in recognition of the foibles that make our society tick. It's just that in the wake of reading Berman's book, I had expected a more penetrating treatment of a very real problem: the calcification of the idea of our culture sans the content. (courtesy of Spengler)"
2,"Not a bad book, but still BAD.","Fussell already said it, and said it with more wit and subtlety, in Class. Has he run out of ideas? Does he need to make a quick buck? He was once capable of so much better..."
2,It didn't teach anything I didn't already know.,"Fussell distinguished between bad and BAD. Bad is obvious trash, but BAD is obvious trash which people think good. The main problem with book is that we all know that USA Today, airports, Hollywood movies, televangelists, and politicians stink. So why read 200 pages about it? Especially if the 200 pages aren't funny enough to justify the time wasted.The minor problem with the book is that Fussell doesn't know enough about economics. So he favors some sort of socialism.You can read this book in under three hours, but why bother, and why waste your money? Read his _Class_ instead."
2,The difference between bad and BAD,I think one of the other reviewers said it best: this book is for unapologetic elitists. It completely turned me off from the first chapter.
5,Fussell book,"Great book at an unbeatable price, shipped to my door. Loved it, and will be back for more. Fussell is not for everyone, but this will open our eyes."
4,How BAD is really Good,"I have read this book at least once a year since I purchased it in 1991. It never fails to make me laugh and make me look at things with a more jaundiced eye. BAD is more than an amusing book. Its a call to reject all the hype in American life that crowds our vision and clutters our thoughts everyday. Since the book was written in 1991, there has only been more BAD heaped on more BAD. There has been the Enrons, WorldComs and Tycos. Companies that were suppose to be the new and improved corporations. There have been a proliferation of Ponzi men schemers. Madoff, Stanford, Rothstein. The BAD has actually just become more outrageous. What we need now is for Paul Fussell to come out of retirement to write ""BAD - The New and Improved Dumbifying of America - Version 2.0."" (Debug Patches to be uploaded later). Buy this book. Have it on your shelf. You will thank yourself the next time you go to a modern museum of art."
3,Serious Job Seekers,This book is not for those just out causally looking for work nor for those with limited skills. I found the book designed for those who hold advance degrees and lacking advance work search techniques.
4,Kowabunga,"Was expecting the box to be in better shape, but no biggie. Love the game, enjoyed playing it as a kid so i had to have it. Overall the game appears in great shape, no marks, and very clean. Instantly played as soon as I popped it into my Snes."
3,Alright,Game doesn't always work properly? Its in pretty good condition physically. I love playing it I just wish it worked a little better.
2,Lots of Blah-Blah,"This novel pushes every parent's worst fear button, that their child will one day suddenly and completely disappear. It is also quite compelling in the scenes with the pedophile kidnapper and the boy. Beyond that, it feels padded and overlong. The characters are screen-ready caricatures, maybe because Harmetz used to cover Hollywood for the New York Times. Most annoying are the numerous moments when the narrative veers, momentarily or for several sentences, into Basic Truth Writing, e.g. ""On some streets, rush hour in Los Angeles lasts all day"" or ""It is odd how quickly the abnormal becomes normal."", the standard weapons of a writer not yet skilled enough or confident enough to rely on her writing alone to convey the intended Basic Truth. While the novel is a quick read -- often because you can skip a lot -- and competently, no more, written, the reasons for the strongly positive reviews of it in the NYT and elsewhere elude me."
4,Harmetz Uses What Few Suspense Novelists Utilize: Her Heart!,"Ms. Harmetz's first novel caught my interest only because of the rave reviews from the Times and others. I would otherwise not have picked up this book, due to its trite subject matter.I was pleasantly surprised, however, by this debut novel.It was not, unfortunately, Harmetz's ""thriller"" technique that won me over. In fact, lesser writers have done better than her at mystery and suspense techniques that keep the reader yearning for more. (Such as plot, knowledge of forensics, clever twists, etc.)No. The thing that lingers with me most, after having finished the book, is her wonderful cast of round and believable (and sympathetic!) characters. Her characters, their reactions and motives throughout the tale show that Harmetz has a heart, and consequently, so do her characters AND book. This is truly the merit of her writing, and truly the evidence of a good novelist.I look forward to more fiction from this writer."
5,A real psychological thriller!!!!,"This isn't your usual story of a runaway child, it's much more than that. The characters are so fully developed that the reader actually sees inside their minds. We see their actions, their emotions, their fears. A mother with a missing child, not every giving up on finding him. A psychopathic killer who loves and hates this child at the same time. And David, the child possessed with deadly fear but profound ingenuity and spunk to make sure he was found. No, this is not just another kidnapping story, this is thriller writing at its best. Read it!!!"
4,You could feel the stress of a mother,"Not a bad read actually. Some of the not-so-important details could be deleted to make it more concentrated. The writing was very smooth but the tension was not that big deal as the other comments said. This is the first book that the publisher boldly treated it as a consumer product which ensured the readers who could return it before Sept. 1, 1997 (it's already past) if you were not satisfactory, and they would return a sum after the tax, shipping and handling costs were deducted. It's a confident investment on the author and I don't think there were many readers would do such thing. This is an author who knew what she's good at and written with a heart. Not thrill at all to me but would be more than enough to lot of other readers. This is a book good for all parents to learn something about how a kidnapping case was occurred and how it was solved with a somewhat predictable ending"
4,Much that a Practising Engineer Can Use,"McGraw-Hill claims that this book spans all of engineering. That it is a concise summary of much in the way of references that a typical engineer would need, whether she is in mechanical, civil, electrical or electronic.Certainly impressive. Probably does live up to the publisher's claim. Tables of dielectric constants, thermal conductivities, electric conductivities, Young's constant, etc. Plus the most used formulas in each field, with succinct descriptions of how to use them. Granted, these descriptions will be of limited use if you have never encountered the formulas before. But the book is intended as a one stop review of things you have hopefully already studied. This is a reference manual, and not a text book.The editors should be commended on a fine work."
5,An unbelievable read!,I was absolutely transported to the time and became friends with the people in this book. I don't remember when I've been so thoroughly engrossed in a book as much as this one.
2,What a Disappointment,"At the beginning of this book, I was captivated by the background of young Kate Elder. Unfortunately, the author definately dropped the ball. There is next to no development of the characters: Silas, little Michael, McGraw et al. They are simply there and then they aren't. The story is told almost as if the author is rushing to get it over with. I just couldn't get involved in Kate's story because the book was so superficial. With such a great character as ""Big Nose Kate"" and her fascinating story, this book is a great disappointment. Now I have to purchase a book about Kate Elder to read ""the rest of the story."""
2,the same thing better graphics,"look at the rating, i got it and then returned it and exchanged it for Call of Duty 2, much much better"
4,Great Game - Map Editor Could Be More In Depth,"As usual, this Far Cry has awesome game play. The single player story line is really in depth and allows you to fully immerse yourself in the game. My only criticism is the map editor, which does not have enough objects to make detailed environments. It is also difficult to make combination maps with indoor and outdoor areas in the same map."
2,Blehh Get the Original FC for PC.,"I must say that when i downloaded the demo for this game i was HIGHLY dissapointed, where are the beautiful water effects, the awesome folige, awesome sunny skys, and even realistic looking weapons. None of these things are to be found here, i could not believe this came out for something with one of the best ATI chipsets in the world runninng it, this looked more like a 800X600 resolution game for a PC with some old Nvidia X4000 card in it. My advice stay away from this one and get the original PC version and if your PC can handle it crank it up and see paradise.On the fun side it was on par with the first but the AI was still pretty crappy. I think Far Cry Instincts on regular Xbox was much much better than this."
4,Far Cry is a far cry...,"This game is not as fun as I had expected it to be after playing the original Far Cry. The graphics and game controls are not as good, and there is absolutely no story line or originality. The title is not an accurate description of the game and the characters do not respond realistically. It is simply a follow on shoot'em up move to the next guy type of game. I still recommend playing it, but I would wait until the price comes down before buying it."
4,Far Cry for the 360...,"I purchased this Far Cry game about 2 months ago. The game is a story driven fps with some extra beef added in. The story (there are 2, one you unlock by beating the other, and one available from the start). I personally did not find the story of this game to be fun, it was hard, it took awhile, and it was very linear (with few exceptions).PROS: Fast competitive online play, with an unparalleled map maker, player creator, and level designingRun of the mill FPS, its pretty much normal, except for the predator partPredator! Its really, REALLY fun to jump around and smack a terrorist with a feral punch, sending him flinging 100 yards across the mapCons: Wow this game is kinda boring, the story portion."
2,bla,"CONS: graphically not that impressive. achievements that aren't really that easy. half-life style vehicle driving, but worse. repetitive gameplay. shoot a helicopter a million times and it won't die unless the game agrees it's the helicopter's time to go. far too easy to get killed a million times by someone/something you can't even see. 2 steps to the left, the screen fills with red and you're dead instantly - why? what killed me? oh it was a sniper i can't even see in the dark, again, for the 29th time. better checkpoints could have helped that, but no luck, so you'll be repeating the same stupid thing over and over and over and over and over again. really no different than any other average shooter out there.PROS: the disc spins in the tray. the game loads and works."
4,Digipower Tripod,"Bought this for my daughter the camera bug and it seems to be really well built so far. Looks great, nice features. Haven't put it through the field testing yet but I believe it will hold up just fine if taken care of. Very lightweight yet seems very stable. Will easily fit in a small backpack or throw it in the trunk of your car without taking up space."
1,Save your money and buy a better tripod,This tripod was a waste of money. The parts are not sturdy and broke after 2 uses. I do not recommend it at all.
3,Not a good textbook.,"Very difficult to read. Assumes no previous knowledge of Fortran, yet does not quite show the reader how to actually write a functional program until late in the book. Chapman's book(s) are much better."
5,The book to read...,"This was a wonderful book. This book tells an amazing story about life in Africa for an American woman. The writer is truly gifted. She wrote in such a way as to make the story and the people in it truly come alive. This book was incredibly difficult to put down and when I did I could hardly wait to find out what happened next. She has an amazing ability to make the reader feel as though you are sitting right there watching the story unfold. The writer is able to reveal her deepest feelings on the pages of the book and doesn't hold anything back which truly makes this book a gem. This is a magnificent book and a must read for anyone remotely interested about life in Africa. I can assure you, you won't be dissapointed."
3,"Great ideas, but...","I enjoyed the content of this book immensely. I visited Kenya three years ago, and ""Jambo, Mama"" did a great job of bringing back many memories. I could really relate to what Ms. Atwood was writing about, all the way down to the constant bribery and corruption. However, reading this book drove me nuts. I am not an English major by any means, but it seems like the manuscript was never read by an editor! It is full of run-on sentences, improper English, and misspelled words. Several of the anecdotes were confusing; the author seemed to forget which person was which in the middle of the paragraph. In addition, the author contradicted herself several times. I found that reading this book was a chore, as my eye kept on jumping to the mistakes. I was bothered that no one ever took the time to proofread this book. It left me doubting the authors' abilities as a writer as well as in the English language in general."
5,AMERICAN REALITY IN KENYA,"AFTER TRAVELING IN KENYA ON TWO SEPERATE OCCASIONS, THERE WAS ALWAYS A DREAM IN THE BACK OF MY MIND--""WOULDN'T IT BE WONDERFUL TO LIVE HERE"" THIS IS A STORY ABOUT AN AMERICAN WOMAN WHO DID JUST THAT. IT WAS A REALISTIC NARRATIVE ABOUT THE JOYS AND DIFFICULTIES OF TRYING TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WITH A SEMI-CLOSED ENGLISH SECTION OF SOCIETY AND THE RULES AND REGLATIONS OF A AFRICAN WORK FORCE THAT SHE HIRED FOR HER RUG MANUFACTURING AND ALL THE PROBLEMS SHE HAD WITH BOTH. IN THE END I THINK IT WAS PURE LONLINESS THAT LED HER BACK TO THE U.S. BUT THE JOURNEY WAS INTERESTING AND INFORMATIVE. I LOVED IT."
1,"Living in Kenya, but avoiding Kenyans","I live in Kenya for 6 months out of each year. My experiences there are both wonderful and difficult, and I am always looking for books written by other foreigners who have lived there. I am VERY disappointed with this book. Ms. Atwood moved to Kenya to experience Africa, but chose to do so from a completely self-centered and white settler basis. She lived in the lap of luxury surrounded by servants and never went out of her way to understand (not to mention participate) in the local culture of Kenyans. She gets excited by things reminiscent of what she calls ""old Africa"", which she then describes as the good old days of the British colonialists. I found her attitude typical of many foreigners living in Kenya, but very disheartening.If you want to learn about Kenya from the perspective of a wealthy and relatively self-centered white lady, this is the book for you. Otherwise, skip it."
5,Review of Jambo Mama,"Jambo Mama is the life story of a woman's move to Kenya. Melinda Atwood's story gives an incredible description of the physical place of Kenya and left me feeling I could walk down the street and recognize every scene she described. However, it is the poignant sharing of her own emotional processing of the move that allows the reader insight into the pilgrimage not only of physical space but also of the soul. Her struggles and triumphs are reflected in her strong style of storytelling and the audience is swept along listening to Melinda's generous sharing of her spirit. I finished the book missing the land of Kenya but also the emotional connection to the author's life."
2,Endearingly banal,"Ditsy rich girl from a dysfunctional family braves the wilds of suburban Brit ex-pat community in Kenya!No threat to Dinesen or Markham. The only redeeming quality is the locale.Modest ""go girl"" appeal and a couple of good swahili puns. Constant reference to ""Ah-frica"" became very annoying."
1,the colonial's africa,"I have travelled to Africa, exstensively, and particularly in Kenya... I found this book to be pedestrian in thought and content, and very colonial in attitude. here is a woman who seems to want to find something new and different in her life, and so travels to Kenya to find it.. and what she does there is recreate her old life that she was looking to escape, and not only that, begins to wonder why she is so depressed. She chooses to live in a white enclave surrounded by white attitudes, and never submerges herself into the bush, the people, the land or the wildlife.. all things that truely make Africa, and Kenya the incredible experience it can be. Terrible book, in it's sadness and the extremes one will go to recreate it- when all one really needs to do to find a new life is be open to new experiences."
5,Harmony in Noise and Melody,"Quite simply, one of the best ambient works ever done. Tim Hecker provides a perfect collison between noise and drone, with all-but forgotten melody lurking beneath surface. The culmination of Hecker's previous works, this piece is all dreamscape with a scratchy, hypnotic vision where the contrast between noise and harmony sound as if it is no contrast at all, but inseparable partners on this intensely emotional voyage.After hearing this CD, I immediately purchased all of Hecker's works. This is definitely the one where he has perfected his craft. Nearly as good, however, would be Mirages, and Haunt Me. If you like this one, be sure to pick up those two as well."
4,Almost Perfect - I Like It Still!,"Was looking originally for a ring with just one X or 3 X's. But came across this continous X ring sold by Eve's Addicition here on Amazon. The ring runs a lil small (Don't think it was a true size 6) but it looks very cool. On a side note I contacted EA about the ring and they quickly and happily fixed any problems by sending me a size 7. Anyways back to the ring... Negatives: 1) Ring runs a lil small so may want to consider one size up when buying 2)Gets dirty/smugy/unshiny very easily. Even if you take the best of care & don't wear it much. So you have to clean it fairly often either by using silver polish or by running under hot water and drying off with soft cloth. Positives: Looks cool, Is Edgy, Its Silver. All said I would still recommend this ring (and the seller) to everyone who loves edgy, cool looking, is fans of letters or even ppl who are straight edge looking for something to symbolize being SXE or ppl who think X=kisses."
4,Nice memories,"This is a fine album that ocassionally reminds us of the magic between Bob and Tobin that has sorely been missed in GbV for some time.Highlights: ""Burns Carpenter,"" ""Total Exposure"" (one of Bob and Tobin's best songs, period), ""Stifled Man Casino"" and ""Feathering Clueless."""
5,Top notch product,Needed good protection for a Canon lens and this case provided it at a great price. Plus a spot for an extra filter as well.
2,Always read the use by date!,"As with food products, books also have a 'use by date'. This book was published in 1991 (16 years ago), and even then it might have been considered an historical review of the subject. Now, 16 years later you can only imagine (unless you purchased a copy) how out of date it is.Yours,T Orr"
4,Minnesota Real and Imagined,"This book isn't for everyone, but Minnesotans should strongly consider reading it. This book is a collection of essays on and about Minnesota and its citizens. Some are rather light-hearted as they detail our recreation and geographic space, while others are more intellectually-based in our religion and politics. Each is very well written and leave one with a better understanding of who and what we are.The book is a bit out dated as it speaks of Jesse Ventura in the present tense, but it still is recent enough that many of the programs and ideals described are still around. Unfortunately, our new governor seems bent on gutting our state government in the name of fiscal reform, but things like the ""Minnesota Miracle"" and our ethnic heritage remain.Again, if you life in California or New Jersey, this may not be relavant, but Minnesotans should strongly consider it."
3,"simply put: good music, horrid vocals","Entwined are undeniably talented at what they do and obviously shape their style off the ways of doomy Paradise Lost/recent Amorphis. I like the riffs and the overall sound of the album very much, but the problem lies in the vocals. The singer tries hard but rarely gets more than a flick of emotion conveyed through how he sings. He tries too hard to be Nick Holmes and it just doesn't work. Perhaps he should try a voice more fitting to the music, a la Anders Frieden of In Flames - a more harsh style would've made this album excellent, but sadly, that's not the case."
3,Awesome Music Ruined By Bland Vocals,"This could be the best cd I own, but with one exception. The music is that of progressive metal, could even pass for some lighter black metal at times, yet the vocals sound that of a horrible rock/gothic vocalist.Complex guitars, drumming, keyboarding, and the same horrible vocal melody throughout the cd. Please, god, please release an instrumental album or pick up a new vocalist. That cd would be worth millions."
1,"The band members still owe me money, music sounds cheap.","The most bland album I have heard this decade! They sound like anything but a gothic metal band. Avoid this if you can, buy the Ministry album instead (they make Spinal Tap sound Heavy and talented!!). Take it from me, I used to be their roadie!!"
1,This Study Guide Has Incorrect Answers!!!,"I have found many errors in this study guide. I thought I was crazy at first, then the rest of the nursing class had the same concern. The errors are in the answer section, it will give you the wrong letter for the multiple choice answer and the correct rationale. I have contacted the publisher and received no response. Nursing School is hard enough, don't add to it with a very frustrating study guide with the wrong answers."
5,Great!,Very moving. Dir. Zhang Yimou's directorial debut and the first in China' beloved Trilogy. Gong Li plays the daughter sold into marriage.
1,I want my money back.,"""Red Sorghum"" is a great movie, but this DVD is a poor copy of a VHS tape. The picture jumps so much I feel seasick. We need some truth in advertising; I didn't know what I was buying."
3,finally find a DVD but a little disappointed,"I used to show a VHS version of this gorgeous movie to my students and the video quality was not good (especially if you have seen the original beautiful color). So happy to see a DVD coming out. However, it is merely a remake of the VHS, with a more readable English subtitle though. In terms of the colors, no way to be compared with the original. I wonder if the UK version is better."
5,beautiful,"This the first film zhang yimou directed, and it is one of his best. unlike some of his later works, red sorghum was produced in china by xian studios(instead of being funded by foreign investors with expectations of profit). the colors are vibrant. this is a wonderful visual experience."
1,"Movie is beautiful, but the copy is HORRIBLE!","I liked the movie a lot> i watched it in th epsat and wanted to see it again and have in personal collection. The copy is very bad: colors are blurred, it was almost imposible to watchit and I don't think that I would watch it again."
2,Poor quality no substitute,"If you didn't read the novel by Mo Yan, who would not be able to follow the film version. Mo Yan's novel is so beautifully written and so compelling, that it is a pity it is represented by such a film. Filming it in red is ok--after all, the novel is about RED sorghum. But everything about the film is a disappointment.Also, my copy of it was poor, and Amazon should not sell such poor copies of a DVD."
4,Thankful,Yes i have this album also.Not sure why the cover pic is not the original as mentioned .Larry has the mellow slick voice still going on this one..As mentioned if your a omd fan go for it.Its mellow and there are no ..E.E Lawson's on this thing...But man E.E Lawson is one of my favorite songs of all time.
3,Hard to find single on Marooned,"Larry's ""The Best is Yet to Come"" was a minor Top-40 and Adult Contemporary hit in the early 80's. VERY hard to find, so I was happy to locate it via Amazon. Larry and the Daredevils have a few great but obscure songs. An example of an Ozark Mountain Daredevils single that for some reason never made much of a splash but sounds great is ""If I Only Knew"" from the ""Car Over the Lake Album""."
4,Amusing Chrismas CD,"John Waters, the legendary 'prince of puke' director of ""Pink Flamingos"" and ""Hairspray"" has compiled a perfectly enjoyable collection of strange Christmas music. Among the tracks are Tiny Tim singing ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer,"" Alvin and the Chipmunks' ""Sleigh Ride,"" the hilariously profane ""Here Comes Fatty Claus,"" and a strange Kwanza Carol ""Santa Claus is a Black Man."" While repeated listening might get tiresome (there are only so many times I can stand to hear ""I Wish You A Merry Christmas""), the CD is a funny and interesting collection of Chistmas music that is not too often played on the radio. Liner notes by Waters are also included."
4,Happy Holidays...,"...from the clearly insane Mr. Waters...this dude truly ain't hooked up rite, as we'd say down South...faves from this collection are the creepy ""Happy Birthday Jesus"", the scurrilous ""Here Comes Fatty Claus"" and last, but not least, ""Santa Claus is a Black Man""...This is the perfect pick me up for any X-mas party. Trust me, your friends and family will not have heard these highly peculiar carols..."
5,John Waters Christmas CD,"A very eclectic and also very enjoyable mixture of Christmas songs! I hate Christmas music personally, but this stuff is pretty entertaining. Be warned though: the tune ""Santa Claus is a Black Man"" will get stuck in your head for a long time."
4,Della in her prime.,"If you like Della Reese, you will like this CD. She has been one of the most durable and likeable singers."
2,Not for beginners,Thank goodness I have had two years of Spanish. Without it this would have been a total waste of time. I don't see how you can learn to speak Spanish from this CD-Rom. I am going to use it to hear the language spoken. I hope I get something out of it. I guess I thought they would have the native speakers acting out or doing something to let you know what they are talking about.
5,Great learning tool,I have already tried there French program with success and I am very enthusiastic about the Spanish. It has helped my confidence greatly. I like the format. It's easy to use and a great fun.
4,Spanish is hard.,"This didn't make Spanish easy to learn, but it made it possible. It's nice to hear native speakers when attempting to learn a new language and this software accomplishes that. And, at about 1/20th the cost of some more well known software programs that do basically the same thing."
3,"3 stars for good writing, not good romance","Stephanie Doyle is a gifted suspense and action writer. That much is evident from the parts in this book relating to codes, fighting, fleeing, etc. However, the romance in this story was lacking. It was not as good as The Doctor's Deadly Affair. Most of the romance occurred in the flashback scenes, and some of it was a bit creepy, actually. The present had very little romance. I kept waiting for the hero to finally ""break"" but he didn't. There was arguably even no happy ending! So even though the book moved along and kept me intrigued, I ended up feeling disappointed."
5,Fantastic Table!!,"My twins absolutely loved this table. They started using it when they were under a year, pulling up on it. As they got older, they were able to use different parts of the table--first they put the cylinders in the slots, then they were able to use the shape sorter, then the stackable part, then finally the threads. And the quality is superb."
5,FUN!!!!,I play with this toy every day and am 10 I know i am older then it saysbut its the best.I think you should buy it.
5,Wonderful Doll,I gave this as a gift to a 5 yr. old girl and she absolutely loved it. She stayed busy trying out all the wonderful things that came with it. It really stirred her imagination.
5,"MGA Chou Chou Doll - Mommy, Make Me Better",My granddaughter fell in love with this doll. It teaches nurturing and caring for a sick baby. The doll met all my expectations and makes a perfect gift for a child.
4,Fun for five year olds,Granddaughter really enjoys playing with doll. The doll has realistic sounds. We did find the velcor opening on back of doll thick so we can't turn cryer on with out opening body cover. Also bandaids don't work to good. Things you can live with for all the joy it bring.
4,My granddaughter loves this toy,For some reason....kids love to nurture and this is a good way to play both Mommy and mom the doctor! I think it helps them not be scared to go to the doctor.
4,The best,I thought it was really fun if you want to make a baby better. It reallysounded like a baby. I think you should buy it at Wal-Mart.you should get it.
5,"Nice doll, different from the rest","My daughter saw this doll online and loved it. She got it for her 5th birthday and it's been a big hit.It works well and has held up. I will give 2 warnings: 1) As another reviewer mentioned, the ""boo-boo"" on her arm never really fades away completely. And to get it to fade a little, you have to use something hotter than just your body temperature, and 2) DO NOT LOSE the spoon that the doll comes with to give her medicine. There must be something special inside it, rather than just the shape, b/c nothing else appears to work.With those caveats in mind, I can definitely recommend this doll."
5,"Excellent, well-rounded,easy read & great study!!","This book was not only an excellent read, but a great time!! It was so funny that I laughed out loud through most of the book. Intelligently written for those struggling to be all for everyone, for those needing a load off of their shoulders as well as for those seeking straight-forward yet gentle encouragement as each attempts to grow as a Christian woman. The chapters are short enough to read one at a time, contain a large amount of unbelievable hilarity with the right amount of theological truth. I would highly recommend this book to anyone & already give the book away as gifts on a regular basis."
4,Nice product........,"Works excellent right out of the box......my only issue with the sprayer is that it doesn't seem to hold its pressure for very long........which means ""pumping it up"" quite a bit to keep spraying. Other than that I like it very much."
1,poor quality,Back straps break away due to the use of cheap plastic holders . The cos. consumer service dept is very un co-operative and very time consuming to reach .This is on the Gilmour BP 4 back pack sprayer .
1,Amateurish,"I'm surprised that anyone who advocates creative thinking would write and publish such a simplistic book that totally lacks imagination in its presentation. Should'nt people who try to sell their expertise in creativity be at least a ""tiny"" bit creative when they produce a book?"
1,Lies,"Let me first start by saying that I haven't read this book and this review is based solely on the author, Kyle Dodd.Kyle is being investigated for using children that he coaches (youth softball) to sell raffle tickets for things that didn't belong to him or the non-profit organization he claimed to be part of. He already plead guilty to theft several years ago for another incident but this goes beyond just theft since he was using kids to help him do it. He is scum of the earth that claims to be holy. I honestly believe that the positive reviews on here are being created by him.Just search his name and 9News and you will see."
4,Solid hockey fun.,"This is definetely a solid and fun hokey game. The graphics are good, and are very comparable to EA's NHL '93. The gameplay is fun, although it trails slightly behind some EA installments. The ESPN lisence gives some nice flavor to the title, and I really enjoyed playing it. It is a classic that you can come back to even if the Genesis is really outdated."
3,"Ultraviolence gets happier, but not enough","Killing God is a very good cd from Johnny Violent. Ok, It's really happier than the first cds, but isn't bad. The first Ultraviolence track i heared was ""Electric Chair"" (from Life Of Destructor)... it's a big jump to the new kind of songs, very (happy)-hardcore-gabber fashioned, in the style of ""Adultery"".Not all tracks on this album are THAT happy-hardcore... its understandable that old fans could feel a little disappointed. It was an evolution that all could wait when we first heard ""Psychodrama"". This cd is good, but it gets a little annoying after a while... this is not that kind of cds you'll be hearing all your life.Anyway, Life Of Destructor wasn't sooooooooooooooooo good, though. Hear the samples first."
2,Boring and badly acted...,"The actress that plays Kate Middleton looks like Katie Holmes from her Dawson's Creek days, yet has the bad acting skills of Kristen Stewart. The film has little context and predictable. Like the Lifetime version so much better."
2,Hammy,"I would give this 2 and 1/2 stars. I find it odd that this pre Trek Shatner is involved with ""Project Vulcan"" and I can swear there is the actor who will go on to play ""Stonn"" on Star Trek in a VERY small bit part (watch for it). A lot of the Outer Limits (in my opinion) come off more like 50's B movies than legit 60's Sci-Fi television, and this ep. is a prime example. I have come to the conclusion that most have good ideas but simply suffer from the TZ's 4 season of ""one hour programs for 30 minutes of good material."" Make no doubt about it, I would buy this on dvd, but it would be one of the last I would buy. Soldier and the Man With The Power are better eps. so check those out."
1,This song is played out...,"This song was the only good song when I got the album, but now it's hella old and played out. The only reason I would even think of getting this single would be if the Missy/Rockwilder mix was on it, but it's not...instead they put the remix on the ""Carmen"" OST. And the remixes that are on here basically [bad] dance remixes."
5,Bootylicious is Groovilicious!,"Let's be honest, here. Destiny's Child's ""Survivor"" was a wildly uneven collection of TRL-ready Black pop. The best song on that CD was easily ""Bootylicious."" Sensual and catchy, it was my jam for the summer of 2001, with its smart Stevie Knicks sample and its memorable chorus. On this CD, the girls take it to another level, and get a bangin' house treatment courtesy of Richard Vission. This mix is louder, grittier, and funkier than the original, and a dub version is also available. Of course, there's a hip hop remix at the end, but it's blah and predictable. Those who know me understand that I have mixed feelings about Destiny's Child (or is it really Beyonce with two backup singers?), but make no mistake: ""Bootylicious"" is groovilicious."
2,okay mixes,I don't like the remixes on this cd. The other two but short mixes are much better. I do like the song very much.
4,"Catchy, very catchy!","I think the album version is the best one, but remixes on this cd are not bad to listen to. I like Vission's and Big Boyz remixes better than the two others (Vission's dub and Case remix). This song sticks in your head after listening to it, the lyrics are catchy and the music is too, a lot of bass, which I absolutely love. The video is also very good. I'm not even a DC fan and I fell for Bootylicious!"
4,Twist on an old favorite,I read this book for a Children's Literature class and I enjoyed the book. The characters are well developed and the plot was good. There are some interesting twists and turns in the book that caught and held my attenion.
1,no comment,"From Washington Post, ""Sir: Your film Shtetl portrayed Poles as subhuman anti-Semites. Your current film shows Germans in a more favorable light. Given that Germans caused the Holocaust and Poles did not, can you explain the contrast between your desire to rehabilitate Germans (and ""feel safe among them"") and your desire to whip up ethnic hatred toward Poles?Marian Marzynski: I strongly disagree that I portray Poles as subhuman in my film Shtetl. I think that I presented them with the same degree of humanity that I portrayed Germans with in my last film.""No comment..."
2,I was very disappointed,"I normally love Pat Ballards books, but when I got this one in the mail I was so excited because I have loved her other 2-Nobodys perfect and wanted one groom. Little did I know this was a bunch of short stories and believe you and me that is what they are. There was no building relationships b/c after reading the first two short stories, I have basically all of them down to a science. Very Very predictable and yet made me wonder why Pat Ballard would publish such a book not worth reading at all."
5,Smash writer's block!,"The first chapter of Fear of Writing outlines the internal process of trying to write and feeling like a miserable failure and neurotic so well; you'll think author Milli Thornton has had access to your thoughts somehow! This book is intended for the fearful or closet writer who needs understanding, encouragement and specific exercises to begin the process of becoming an active writer. I used Fear of Writing as a student manual in the Fear of Writing Online Course, and found the fertile material exercises and encouraging tone throughout the book highly valuable. If you suffer from writer's block of any kind, do yourself a favor and use the methods outlined by Thornton in Fear of Writing. It helped me tremendously."
5,I'm free!,"I didn't really think of myself as a closet writer, or even a writer of any kind for that matter, until I read a copy of ""Fear of Writing."" Even though I had ideas for books ""I want to write someday"" swimming in my head, I never had the courage to embrace the idea of it actually coming to fruition until I read Milli's book. Her book changed my attitude and diminished my fear within the first few pages. ""Fear of Writing"" gave me instant inspiration and permission to write freely without worrying about making a mistake. Heaven forbid I make a mistake! I've been doing that in my everyday life, so why am I worried about it in writing? I love this book and I respect Milli for her courage and tenacity to make this book happen and her willingness to share her knowledge. If you have ever once considered creating a story of any kind, do yourself a favor and read Milli's book. You won't regret it."
4,Kalaya Emu Oil Moisturizing Shampoo Review,"I ordered both the shampoo and the spray and let me first say that Kv Pet Supply shipped my items fairly quickly. Both bottles were wrapped with tape so they wouldn't spill in the package which was great. Now onto the actual product.I used the shampoo once so far on my dog and his fur is soft, but there's no difference from when I used his flea and tick shampoo and an oatmeal conditioner together. The smell is definitely pleasant and he has yet to make an attempt to scratch at a skin rash he has under his front leg (it could just be from allergies, so we changed his food alongside the new shampoo). I'll be waiting to see if this shampoo will continue to ease out the itching from his skin problem and possibly make his fur softer than before. I would recommend this product and might even buy the gallon version if I see it still gives him good results."
5,LOVE this shampoo!,"Used on Sheltie and 2 Yorkies... wonderful! Softened the hair. The dried hair of Bailey (yorkie) now lays nicely... soft... nice sheen! Heidi's hair (yorkie) has always had a nice sheen, but now looks fuller... now so soft! Holly (sheltie) softened her hair to the touch! Nice! Love the smell of this product. Even left the bathroom smelling nice after their baths. I've used high dollar doggy shampoo before... this shampoo... I WILL purchase again."
3,It Smells Good And Moisturizes OK. But Don't Expect Miracles,"I bought this after reading the glowing reviews.I used it to wash my long suffering pit bull who has a host of skin issues. The poor guy has a systemic yeast infection and a bit of mange common to the breed and he is forever plagued with a mixture of hot and oily spots, and dry and scaly areas all over his body.This shampoo made his smell good and made his fur look better, but was no magic cure for his skin ills. (I didn't expect it to be.)For the price I got, I can't complain. I'd recommend it based on its smell alone.Oh yea, hydrocortizone cream works best for my old dog. Right now he is all cleared up. Why didn't I think if it before?!"
4,It is a good shampoo,Kalaya Emu Oil Shampoo seems to work well for my Westie. He still has skin issues - but not from dry skin.
3,Excellent information; poor audio,"This 4 tape series begins with 2 tapes of debate. Scott Hahn and Dr. Knudson (sp), a Protestant, cover Authority, Justification and the like. It is awesome, until the microphone levels on Dr. Knudson are so low, you can barely hear his discussion.I recommend the series, but be prepared for less than perfect audio."
4,good for cycling,"it's kind of funny. for the longest time when i would ride in 50-60F temperatures, i thought my feet went numb because my cycling shoes were cutting off my circulation, and at somepoint i had what may seem to some an obvious epiphany: my feet were really cold. i bought some of the other wool-blend cycling-specific socks, but even doubling up on those didn't change the state of my tingly toes. i decided to try the smartwool socks after reading the reviews. they're an order of magnitude better! they're thin and lightweight enough for my cycling shoes, but way warmer, and they have just a little bit of cushioning on the bottom that i really like. my feet still get a bit cold in < 60F conditions, but at some point, you can't really blame the socks. i'm probably part vampire or cold-blooded creature or something... and i should point out they're plenty warm when there's not all that wind from cycling."
2,Great except for shoddy construction,"I love these socks for their warmth, cozy feel, moisture-wicking abilities, and fit, but they are poorly constructed. The heel wears out quickly. For socks of this price, this is a dealbreaker and something the company ought to attend to. I've bought these socks for years, butafter disocovering another hole in a sock heel, I don't believe I'll be ordering these again."
5,love smart wool,These are my favorite socks. I want more!!! I can't say enough about them. They are worth the money. !
5,my wife's favorite socks,"i bought 3 pairs of these for my wife and she loved them so much she asked me to buy them for her again, so this year i got her another 3. the have just the right amount of cushion but are not too thick which makes them perfect for everyday work socks. she says these feel very comfortable, keep her feet warm yet dry and cozy. great product."
3,Not Sure,When I received these socks in the mail I wasn't so impressed. I ordered these sock only because I am headed to DC in January I heard the weather is very cold there. These socks suppose to be warm to your feet. I wore them here in Little Rock and they were all right. I hope they work for me in Washintong DC because I was not so impressed with them here also they really didnt stay up to my calf one kept on sliding down in my shoe and I do not like that. For the price over $13 for 1 pair of sock they should be the bomb. I will see when I get there.
4,"Warm, but to thick for most of my shoes.","I had a pair of the cable knit Smartwool socks and these looked similar, but unfortunately they are much thicker and do not fit in my shoes."
5,Best Socks on Earth!,I recently purchased several pairs of women's SmartWool socks and found them to be fabulous! Soft to the touch yet durable. The wool content wicks the moisture and keeps my feet always feeling warm . I wear then constantly. I'm extremely pleased with my new SmartWool socks.
1,Not the same quality as older smartwool!,"My wife has worn smartwool socks for years - they are the only socks that she will wear in the winter to keep her feet warm and be comfortable all all day. This fall, I purchased 6 pairs (from two different supliers) of socks as a gift. All of the socks received were rough and scratchy (like old wool socks, not as expected from smartwool).I have contacted Smartwool. They stated the product was likely a defect or recalled lot that should not be sold.I am returning my socks to amazon."
5,Favorite Socks,These are my favorite socks. They breath better then other socks when worn with my safety boots. I highly recommend them.
5,outstanding,Damien Dempsey is a brilliant young singer songwriter who writes and sings from the heart. His voice carries the feelings of a generation of young Dublin people who have lived through the devestation of whole communities due to drugs and he captures the mood perfectly.His music encompasses folk and reggae and his own blend of urban trad and is a joy to listen too.No dissapointments here.....
2,Poor valve design,"Valve never did open, even when the timer indicated it was open. Removed the electronic portion to inspect how the valve actually operates and noticed that a pin about the diameter of a needle is connected to a diaphram. The pin is pushed down by knob protruding from the electronic portion to open up the valve. For some uknown reason this pin was sliding past the diaphram failing to open the valve. It looks very flimsy and appears that it even if it did work right the first time that after a number of openings and closings that it would wear out rather quickly. The valve design needs to be revised to something more rigid and less flimsy. Its not worth $40. Thumbs down on this one."
4,Reliable timer - recommended,"This timer was a little hard to program, but I love the performance. It reliably opens and closes at the right intervals. What a pleasure it has been not to have to worry about watering my vegetables. As I write this review, I am 500 miles away on vacation, and the Gilmour is doing what I used to have a neighbor do ... water my garden. Enjoy."
1,Didn't last long,9400 worked for only about 1 season. Leaks like crazy. Cheap piece of junk made in China. All plastic. Live in Texas needs to work for 8 months.
1,This is a complete piece of junk,"This almost $60 timer worked for one summer. The next year it was completely seized and the rubber sealing gaskets were distorted and out of their seating. Consequently it leaked a torrent of water when in the OFF position, rendering it useless. It could not be repaired. Anyone with any sense will steer clear of rubbish like this."
2,Gilmour Parts Policy,"I own 6 or 7 Gilmour water timers and they are nice pieces of equipment--until you have a problem. I have had two out-of-warranty failures--one after several years of use and one after two years of use. In both cases I was unable to obtain repair parts. Most recently I had a Model 9400 fail after two years of use. A small crack developed in the valve body and I wanted to buy a new one. I was told that they had changed that model this year and there were no parts available for the previous version. All the customer service I received was an 'I'm sorry.' Net, I have a $45 piece of worthless plastic and electronics that will have to go to the landfill I see they have made this even more painful. The current version of this model sells for $140. In the future I won't touch this or anything else made by Gilmour simply based on the customer service decisions they make. Proceed at your own risk."
2,difficult to program,Very difficult to program.I will use it manually as it does not work as programed.
4,Water Timer,I bought this water timer more than 3 weeks ago and so far it works as advertised. The timer made to withstand the harsh outdoor environment.
5,Great water time (and valve can be replaced),"I have two of these water timers and they are great. By far the easiest to program of the ones I have used.I also wanted to chime in and say that I had the same problem with the back half (valve) part freezing over the winter. I forgot to open them and they got moved to our shed in the back yard from the heated room I had stored them in.Anyway I called Gilmour and ordered two new valves which cost $8 each plus $2 shipping, way less then I was expecting. I have broken two of these valves in 5 years so they do fail if not stored above freezing (or drained) but it is not something that has happened every year. I would recommend storing the valve inside during the winter."
1,Expensive Junk,"We need a timer for watering. Unfortunately, this is the only model our local nursery and garden center carries. I have bought 6 of them. All have failed, and the nursery will not take returns. Some work for a couple of days, some don't. It seems like the knob which seats in the cover does not go deep enough and will try to turn on, but doesn't. Just clicks and clicks. Looking for a completely different model on the internet now. Don't buy this item. If you and your flowers depend on it, you will both be sorry."
1,Plastic Gears,"After a year the timer stopped working. It had a loud clicking sound when trying to open the valve. I wrote Gilmour for help but they did not answer. I openned the timer side and to my amazement, all the gears and shafts are plastic. One of the shafts broke making it impossible for the gears to work. Since I was outside the one year warrenty; even though I disarmed it during the winter; I was out of luck and tossed it. It might cost more to make the gears and shafts out of non-rust metal, but as it is it is very fragle."
2,2nd unit was terrible,"The first Gilmour I had (same model, 9400) lasted about 3 1/2 years. Based upon that, I ordered this model again... big mistake! The center seal (behind the red button) went bad within months. This was the same problem that compelled me to replace the first unit... 3 1/2 years on the first unit, 3 months on the second. I will NOT be buying Gilmour again!"
2,irrigationn timer,very time consuming to set the timer for the different watering functions.rain- bird made the easiest timer to set and Gilmour could take a lesson from them for their hose bibb timer.
2,Great timers for a while...,"There timers work great... for one season. We have never had one last more than that. We are now on our third one but this year is the last, we need to find something that will last years, not months.I don't know what it is about them but at the beginning of the growing season when we take them out to reuse, they never seem to work. In fairness our model seems to be a PPGF20, not this one. Maybe this one finally addresses this problem?"
2,Agree with weekend woodworker,"This is the second Gilmor model I have used, both relatively short lived. This particular unit is in it's second year. And having a problem similar to WW's - the timing unit seems to be working ok, but apparently does not have sufficient power to turn the ball valve, which seems to require an inordinate amount of pressure to turn by hand. It is also not possible to dissamble the valve-it seems to be mechanically pressed into it's housing. Despite this I plan to investigate replacing the valve part of the unit, as there seems to be no other simple alternative to timed watering."
1,eats batteries like crazy!,"On the plus side, it's easy to program.On the downside, this thing worked OK for a month or so, until it just quit unexpectedly and I had to replace the batteries already. Since then, seems like the batteries are exhausted after 1 or 2 weeks, depending on the weather (cold or hot). Of course, each time, I have to reset the time and reprogram it. Not worth the trouble and expense in my opinion."
1,One year later,"I've had it a month and still can't get it to work. This is not an easy device to set up. I can do it manually but not with the timer. I will continue to try.One year later. I sat down with this and figured out how to work it. It just takes some patience. It has been a year and it works just fine. I have now a water system that essentially works on its own and reliabily. The battery gave out after a year, which I think is pretty good considering it works twice a day during the summer and once a day during the winter. I can't change the rating it seems, but I would give it a four star now."
5,A LITTLE PRICEY BUT WELL WORTH IT,"Here in Hawaii we have a limited source of items such as these. Most stores carry the lower-end models. I use two of these timers to water my bonsai trees so I definitely need something I can trust. They were relatively easy to program but did require a little patience. Have been in use for nearly a month now and the clock is maintaining the time and since they use batteries I don't have to worry about them when we lose power - which isn't infrequently! This is my second set of Gilmour timers that I have used and absolutely loved the other ones so hope these will last as long. My others lasted several years and the batteries were still going strong every year when I changed them ""just in case...."""
1,Beware of Water Hammer,"I have tried several of these Gilmour timers. They all have the same problem. They use a rubber diaphragm that closes by water pressure, which effectively shuts off the water in a fraction of a second. For me and the pipes in my home, this causes SIGNIFICANT ""water hammer"". [...]Sooner or later, water hammer will bust your pipes. You will know if it is a problem by the sound. You will hear a distinct ""bang"" somewhere in your pipes when the device shuts off. To a lessor degree, you may hear it when it turns on.I emailed Gilmour about the problem. After a week or so they replied, and asked for the model number. I gave it to them, and they would not communicate with me anymore after that. Apparently they wanted the information for their own analysis, but were completely unwilling to help me with the problem.There are other timers out there that open and close more slowly, entirely avoiding the water hammer problem. Try something else, or risk a major plumbing bill."
2,Awesome...when it works,"We've had this for about 3 months. It worked great. Then one day, nadda. It won't turn the valve on. When I remove the controller, I can rotate the valve by hand with little effort and the controller unit actually does operate without any load (the valve) on it. When I replace the removable controller and try to turn it on, it just clicks and clicks and clicks and .... Cheap plastic gears. But don't expect much if anything better from the other comparable products out there.I will concede that if you are able to keep it in a shaded area, it may work longer for you. Mine was in direct sunlight all day so I'm sure those internal plastic gears got pretty soft from the heat. Just keep this in mind when you are buying these devices."
4,Great Book!,"I really liked this book, except for the fact that Frank and Nancy don't get together. I just think they belong together, and that Ned and Callie obviously don't mean anything. Anyway, I still haven't found a book where they get past that stuff. But that's off the subject. This is a very good book, and is very confusing, making it more of a good mystery."
4,One of the better books on speed reading,This is one of the better books on speed reading. It has terrific exercises to do daily.It is a good book for anyone at any level. Well worth it.Definitely recommended.
3,Not perfect but it's a Start,"I had high hopes for my first book on Speed Reading. I read it in one day so it must have helped. But the FIRST technique had to do with focusing on the center of the line, then using peripheral vision to scan left then right. The SECOND technique had the reader practicing an imaginary line down the center of the text... then ""absorbing"" the left side of the text with your eyes, then the right. So when I went to apply the techniques in regular reading, I was confused about what I was supposed to be doing. Perhaps the ""in class"" version of his course would have been more helpful so I would be able to ask questions.Also worth noting, a lot of the book was just study questions for stories in the book or books he recommends you read for practice. He also had some helpful suggestions for test taking and studying, in general."
5,What a Difference,I am reading a lot faster and what a difference it is.Its not as difficult as I thought I'd be.The results speak for themselves I highly recommend this book.
2,Didn't really get much out of it...,I read this to help prepare for the LSAT and I have to say it didn't help much.
5,"Works great, fast delivery, great quality.",The 25' RG-6 cable I bought is great quality and I would recommend it to anyone. Can't beat the price and the service was graet
3,"it ain't no ""style no. 6312.""","don't you hate it when a band puts out a wonderful debut album only to follow up with a an album that good, but just doesn't measure up to the first? unfortunately, this is the case with ""menergy."" many of the songs are quite good and rock in the same fashion that the songs on ""style no. 6312"" did, however, after a few listens, the songs hat aren't quite as distinctive (especially the slower ones) tend to blur together and get muddy and overshadow the good songs. definitely worth checking out as songs such as ""animal chin"" and ""the constant is zero"" are great, but it ain't no ""style no. 6312."""
3,Nothing particularly revolutionary here,"It's similar to his other clean-up books, but the information is readily available free on the web. I can't recall reading anything that made me think, ""aha!"""
2,Don't Bother...,Talk about cardboard characters and no plot and you've got William Gibson down to a T!!! The only thing that saves this book - a thought that applies to almost all his work - is the near-future background. That's all! AND it is NOT enough. Having read Neuromancer and loved the pace I have been consistently disappointed since. Idoru made me finally decide never to try another of his works.
3,"Good, but not masterful","This was the first Gibson book I've ever read, and I have to say I was a bit disapointed. I still really enjoyed the book, but I expected it to blow me away. The book seemed a little bit too steeped in pop-culture. Too much focus on the ""scene"" of the future, and not enough focus on the technology behind it. But, you dont have to take my word for it..."
4,Idoru = Princess Diana,"Gibson published this book in 1996 and Princess Diana died in 1997. In all ways, Princess Diana was the Idoru of our time and culture. And Gibson, amazingly enough, predicts the international emotional outpouring and celebrity *worship* that greeted Diana.I could not escape the comparison as I was reading the book, and chances are you won't be able to either. It makes the story that much more powerful and scary."
4,I like your computer...,"This book could have been as good as Neuromancer. The strengths of this book are: the concept of Rei Toei, the concept of limited fame, Blackwell, The Walled City and Arleigh McCrae. The weaknesses of this book are: Chia's smuggling coincedence (dumb), not enough Rei Toei, and nanotech. Do not get me wrong I liked this book but it could have been so much more. Chia being a big Lo/Rez fan and meeting MaryAlice on the plane and smuggling the nanotech device is too much. The nanotech concept is never fully developed on why the buildings seem to grow with people living in them and how the island in Tokyo Bay was going to work. Rei Toei is hyped by having the book named after her and the plot revolves around her but she is never fleshed out. Gibson seems to be taking on too many characters and concepts. I hope he narrows his scope in later books and has more detail on his vision."
2,Too quiet.,"The story wasn't too bad, but I couldn't finish it! I tried like crazy to remain interested in this book! I thought Neuromancer wasn't great, but I liked the concept. At least Neuromancer had SOME action in it! This one is a loooooooooooooooooooong conspiracy, I really kept wishing would go somewhere. I got through over half the book before I just couldn't bring myself to pick it up again! The characters are boring, but the story was kind interesting... but it took forever to get anywhere! I wouldn't recommend this one if you like fast-paced novels. This one builds a little too slowly."
2,details details,"A fast paced, intensely detail orientated book by long time cyber fiction writer Gibson. The story plot is a mixture of Japanses pop culture/ Russian espionage with an innocent girl and confused man caught in the middle. The plot seems like a decoy for Gibson to speculate about future gadgets and new technology. The writing is choppy and boring. The characters are not thought out, and several meaningless red herrings are thrown in just for the heck of it. Overall, I found it not very stimulating. But maybe it's just me."
2,This Ain't No Neuromancer,"Idoru has a decent setup, and ok characters. What damns it is the worst ending ever. Don't invest time in this joke of a book."
2,"Come on, Gibson!","We want more from the guy who came up with Burning Chrome and Neuromancer! To William Gibson: ""You can do it! You did once, so it must be in there. Go back and start fresh and do it again! "" I've read all of Gibson's works so far, and I have to agree with the review by Josh and others. This book wasn't even as good as Virtual Light. Definitely ""light reading for that ride on the train"". I will, for now, keep buying and reading his books, but I really, really miss the old Gibson."
3,program is developing self-awareness,"Another computer virtual reality type story. A media star wants to marry a video/dance program that lives in some virtual reality place, the idoru. A teenage fan club, that also has some VR identity, sends a girl off to inspect the notion of their star making a fool of himself. The star's security team is worried that he is being shanghaied into some inappropriate situation. A computer geek is brought in by the security team to track down the program's inception and to protect the star from himself.The program is developing self-awareness as a part of what she was to be doing, which was to be an independent creative entity in videos. The real rub is that the program needs to have some illegal stuff that a Russian Mafia wants as well."
4,A good buy and worth $7.00,"Good characters and interaction, especially with the ""hero"" Laney. Good scenes that made the book hard to put down at times (especially the one in the love hotel). Although Idoru had a decent story, there were parts that I couldn't buy, even in a SF novel. I found the AI construct that Gibson creates too conveniently powerful and wise. Still, this book compares well with the others on the shelves and I can easily recommend it for purchase."
3,Idoru,"I have never even checked in with what others have said about a particular book, until now. I agree with nearly every work that Joshua said in his review, so I won't restate the details. I just got more and more bogged down until I was thinking it was just me. I love Gibson's other works and read a lot of SF most on the themes of cyberspace, technology, sci fi culture, but this was certainly a disappointment on many levels. Now approximately 7/8 done, I will finish, but it won't go up there with the best of the best."
3,Miles better than Virtual Light,"Not bad, but not Neuromancer. His abilty to depict a disjointed and hard-edged cultural distilation doesn't shine and reverberate like it did in the original books, but he's still a man alone in the genre he reiterated. I am irritated that he doesn't give credit to his musical inspirations: here he lifted one of Rez's quotes from Digital Heroes of Hyphoprisy, and in All Tomorrow's Parties, he is leeching from Sisters of Mercy with his use of ""this... corrosion"" and ""vision thing."""
4,"""Idoru"" is fast, furious and great fun.","In ""Idoru"", the internet has become an enourmously big part of the world. Virtual reality is larger than life itself, and many people live their lives through computers. The story i quite complex, and follows two main characters through a wicked plot involving all sorts of cyber-fun. All I can say is: read it. You won't regret it!"
2,More time than it was worth,"Throughout the story I was slightly bored. I have never started a book that I have not finished and was not about to start with this one. Hoping the end would bring together the boring tangents into something that would at least allow me to feel I had not totally wasted my time, I continued reading. The inspiring finish was not there, and the writing never improved. Certainly I have read far worse books, but I cannot think of anything nicer than that to say about this book either."
2,Neither Ideas Nor Characters Come to Life,"This is my first experience of Gibson, having been an avid SF fan in the past.For me, the best SF combines the development of exciting ideas with well-formed characters. Good SF usually has interesting ideas but flat characters. ""Idoru"" has flat characters and a real paucity of new ideas.It is one of those books you forget 10 seconds after you put in down. It is certainly very readable and fast-moving - a kind of futuristic Jeffrey Archer. But like Archer, it has no substance. And the ending was quite frankly abysmal.As for the ""futuristic"" Tokyo - well I live here, and 95% of what he describes is already here today - but then most of his readers won't know that, of course.A real disappointment, in my opinion."
2,This book needs an editor!,"I love Gibson's earlier work, in the days when he had aneditor tighten his prose. Now that he's a star, he clearlydoesn't use an editor (or the editor is asleep). This bookneeds tightening in its prose. There is little left of theGibson as Chandler descendent that I saw in earlier works.There is lots of cute that is there for cute, not forforwarding the story.So I thank my wife for the birthday present of Idoru but am extremelydisappointed. Mike Zyda"
3,"Okay story, already dated though.","Even though this book came out in 1996, it the technology of the future doesn't really seem that remarkable at all. Take out the ""gee-whiz"" factor of the technology, and you're left with a story about two people who don't ever meet. I've never read anything of Gibson's before, so maybe you had to be a fan to enjoy this book. It's not the worst thing I've ever read by any means, but a page-turner, it was not."
4,Still very good.,"Gibson's settings and characters are still as vibrant as before. However, instead of a story that is crucial to the survival of the world, all this trouble centers around pop culture figures that only matter to a bunch of teens. To me, this made the story that much more funny and interesting--to see so many lives and resources devoted to fan culture. A view of the future? or of today already?The climax may leave many readers dissatisfied, as it is both confusing and predictable at the same time. Also, passing off things in current Japanese culture as futuristic was very annoying. Does Gibson consider Japanese consumer products to be strange enough already so that he doesn't have to evolve them to make them futuristic? Or is Gibson just unable to be imaginative from a non U.S. perspective? I hope it's the latter, because I'd be offended by the first."
3,Good ol' Bill Gibson,This one I read twice. The third time I may actually get it. Like watching a tornado at night.
2,This is no Neuromancer,"For Gibson fans looking for shades of Neuromancer, FORGET IT!. Idoru might as well be Count Zero #4. Like his unimpressive follow-ons neither the plot nor the setting have the innovation and stimulus of Neuro. Unlike the forward-looking Neuro with a truly imaginative and intersting future, plot, and locations, Idoru is merely modern Tokyo and US with robots and nano-tech tacked on as if they were afterthoughts. The plot is usual Gibson. Cynical-yet-gifted 'alternative' misfits plodding through the plot and getting by on 'instinct' without seeming to care about anything. I am truly disappointed, both by the book and its misleading reviews."
4,Kindergarten cyberpunk,"I've been a great fan of Gibson's writing ever since i read Neuromancer. Throughout his books he has maintained a vision of a society very much like ours, but with a whole new world surrounding it. I think Iduro is a very good book, but it lacks the vividness of Gibson's earlier work. It follows a very clear line, even though the reader doesn't get to see it all the time, and the characters only walk along that line. My advice is: Read this book and marvel, then read the earlier ones and you'll see what I mean."
2,it could be better,"With all the fuss about William Gibson, I was excited to read IDORU, but it proved out to be a mediocre book. The story is poorly developed and the plot seems like ""you've seen that before"" type. If you really want to read some fine sci-fi, don't read this particular book. You can also try something else from Gibson, but not this one"
3,Forget it is Gibson and you might enjoy it,I would agree with the other reviewers who question whether Gibson arrived on the idol scene too late. The book is Gibson's most sparse to date but does have some interesting ideas. It is one of those books that will cause you to think of things on your own that are much cooler than what is in the book. Worth reading if you are a fan
3,Disappointing and incomplete,"It had to happen sooner or later: After such brilliance as ""Virtual Light"" and ""Burning Chrome,"" Gibson has really slipped. The meandering plot, the calling-forth of characters from ""Virtual Light,"" and the dependence on Japanese hi-tech news, and finally, the ending which left nearly everything hanging... The premise of ""Idoru"" is not new, by any means. As an American who lived in Japan from 1987 to 1997, I have seen human ""Idoru's"" as well as virtual ones created on CD Rom for adult ""games"" as well as ""famicom,"" the fore-runner of the Play Station and the Nintendo. Watch nearly any Japanese Anime, and you find that the ""Idoru"" has existed for a long time. Hopefully, so will Gibson's talent, but quite frankly, this latest book puts that into question"
2,gibson needs to get over himself,"by far the worst book that gibson has written, idoru is justanother case of something good getting trapped by it's ownoverhipness (not unlike a too-popular tech magazine). theonly good new original idea in the book (walled city) istouched upon only in the most brief mention. his writingstyle has descended into non-sentences which just don'twork. if you want to read good cyberpunk go somewhere else,older works or stephenson."
2,Not a satisfying read,"If you read the summary on the first page, then you have read all that you need to know about ""Idoru."" Some, if not all of the quotes by major publications praising this novel made me wonder if I was reading the right book. Anyway, ""Idoru"" focuses on the characters, hired ""netrunner"" Colin Laney and teenager Chia McKenzie and their association with the mysterious Rei Toei, who, if I may add, doesn't appear until later in this yarn.This is the first book I read by Gibson, whom I heard is one of the great writers of science fiction. This, however, is not his best work. The premise is alright, but we (the reader) are introduced to too many characters. I had a difficult time figuring out who was who. Plus, this 383 page book could have been reduced to half its length. Idoru is for die-hard Gibson fans."
1,poor quality,"First, I thought these were the standard 351 shape and they are not. They are smaller and the tip is more blunt than the 351 making them a ""slower"" pick. But my real complaint is quality. As a former sheet metal punch press programmer these are my observations. Small parts ""oil-can"" when created with a single punch operation. These are ""oil-canned"" and not flat. No attempt was made to flatten them out. They are bowl shaped and the edges are square. Not beveled like the picture. I read another complaint before about this and it is true. For the cost I expected some quality. These picks literally cost about a penny a piece to manufacture ""as-sold"". You know how a machine gun sounds on auto-fire? That's how fast a CNC spits out parts like these."
3,Not bad but not good either,"Upsides:-The tips won't wear down like on my other guitar picks-These little guys add a tiny almost un-notable amount of brightness-They feel great to hold-They'll last a long time and look cool-I can keep these in my pockets without worrying about snapping one or chipping themDownsides:-It sounds as if I were playing with a quarter. That's without exaggeration, I've actually played with coins before just for the heck of it.-I thought they'd have a bit more roundness to their edges, but they actually have flat edges which slows down playing-They really chew up your strings after a whileAll-n-all:They're worth a shot, everyone's different and likes different things. This could end up as your favorite. :)"
5,What the hobby needs,"It's the same basic system as Ye Olde Dungeons & Dragons without all the baggage that D&D brings with it to every new edition. In other words this is fantasy without Elves, Dwarves and Orcs. The new races and classes are still the basic literary fantasy types just not the D&D types. If you are bored with the D&D archetypes or find the rules being taken in nonsensical directions to meet the expectations of earlier editions check this new players handbook out."
5,The best magic system ever.,"The idea of racial levels is great, although some of the races I didn't like so much. But the spells and the magic system is why everyone should buy this book: heightened, ladened, and diminished spells. As well as spell templates, balanced, working fighter-mages, and the witch class that is infinitely better than the Adept class.Anyone who plays a Magic-User or runs a game with NPC Mages should buy this book."
3,Not Impressed,"After all I had heard about Monte Cooks books I was not impressed with this book. Yes, it does contain some new crunchy bits but not enough to bother with the money. Most of this book is info you already have in your core D&D books. If you want something worthwhile from Monte - buy Ptolus or anything to do with his world."
2,Stuck in the 80's,"I didn't really care for this when it came out in the 80's - too little of Steve's guitar and WAY too much synthesizer as was typical of the times. Never to be one to follow trends, I think, based upon the success of its predecessor, this was a failed attempt to stay relevant. On listening to it now, it seems anachronistic and definitely stuck in the 80's.I wish they'd release some of Steve's missing 70's catalog instead of this dreck."
5,A FUN ELECTRONIC CLASSIC,"A just found the CD copy online of this alblum, I have not heard the Italian X rays since I was very young.It is not perfect,, But why dos it need to be its entertainmentits fun listening to the start of the new electronic sounds."
1,Synthesizer Foolishness,"Italian X-Rays represents the lowest point - creatively and production-wise - to which Steve Miller ever sunk. It is awash in synthesizers, mostly written by the likes of Kenny Lee Lewis and Byron Allred (band members), and chock full o' cringe-worthy material. ""Bongo Bongo"" is probably the most inexplicably bad song on the album. Sample lyrics: ""she likes it she likes it my baby she likes it my baby she likes to dance"". What was he thinking? This album will leave you feeling bored and violated. To be fair, ""One in a Million"" - the last sing on the album - is a nice little acoustic ditty that is vaguely reminiscent of ""Circle of Love"". That's about the nicest thing I can say about the album, that and the album art/packaging was cool."
3,A fun listen,"While certainly not his best, this CD is not nearly as bad as the previous reviewers indicate. I have an import copy and the sound is great. While the synthesisers are bit overdone, it's a fun listen with some very catchy songs -- particularly ""Who Do You Love,"" ""Golden Opportunity,"" ""Hollywood Dream"" and ""One in a Million."" If you're a late '70s era Steve Miller fan, you should have this!"
1,"""X"" This One Out","""Italian X-Rays"" is the album that marked the end of Steve Miller's run on rock radio in the mid-1980s. Miller had flirted with new wave music and synthesizers on his previous effort, ""Abracadabra,"" and was perhaps mislead into believing he needed to stay ahead of musical trends. As a result, he turned his back on his strengths, namely his laid back, hook laden, middle-of-the-road guitar rock style. Also lacking Miller's previously displayed deft songwriting touch, ""X-Rays"" contains nary a song worth hearing. It is worth noting that during his recent concert tours, he avoids this material like the plague. Comparable to Neil Young's unfortunate mid-80s new wave mistake ""Landing On Water,"" this one should be avoided at all costs."
2,"Things really WERE better in the ""good old days""!","This a a trick that's been updated-- back in the 50s and 60s, it used to come routinely as part of kid's magic sets. Back then, it was a chunk of solid wood, painted red, with a thin covering in the bottom designed to be identical to the wood. It worked reasonably well-- the product was better designed and heavier, the gimmick far better camouflaged, and the young magician's peers less cynical and suspicious.Now, the product is made of cheap red plastic with a cloth bottom and practically screams ""gimmicked"", and the magician's peers are looking way too closely. The coin is fine-- not perhaps the best on the market but satisfactory. The Magical Block Trick certainly isn't worth buying to get the coin... while Amazon doesn't currently carry the equivalent penny, at least one internet magic company sells bags of six for $3.65, or about 60 cents apiece.I'd pass this one by..."
3,ii kedo kanpeki ja nai,"This C.D is good but not perfect. Kazumi Watanabe is one of the best accoustic guitar players in the World. But who knows it? I realized how talented this guy is while attending an unplugged concert in Nagano. This album is a trial for classic electric guitar, and four out of eight titles are really good: ""Spain"", ""Babi's bossa"" (Kazumi's beautiful ballad), ""Someday my prince will come"" and ""Dandyism"". Unfortunately, Makoto Ozone's piano is too present and two of those are versions of existing titles. Then this album is not up yo ""DOGATANA"", the unique accoustic Masterpiece of Kazumi Watanabe."
5,Stories Make It Work,"Rosen, Case and Staubus have authored one of the most readable books I have encountered on employee ownership and the difference it can make for employees and companies, irrespective of industry or geography. This book is filled with very personal stories, as well as compelling dreams that have been realized through the collaboration of owners at all levels of an organization. The authors provide rich evidence in the post-Enron era that hope is very alive for business models that invite all employees into the opportunities for success. After reading the book I had a list of several businesses I wanted to visit just to see how they've done it. Definitely an inspiring book!"
3,Good Overview,"I found this to be a good overview with some interesting annecdotes and useful tips for spotting the signes of questionable financial behavior. The tone became repetetive after awhile though, with paragraph after paragraph of ""for example the Russian Mafia is doing this"" or ""X million dollars was laundered through Antigua in 1999"" type factoids. I found it very interesting reading but the interesting and useful substance could probably have been covered in 40-50 pages"
4,Money laundering 101,"This one is easy to read, by Lilley, an ace headhunter. The book arrived quickly and in good condition. Lilley gives you the basics of the ""laundry"" business, so if you need to move some money off-shore or wash it . . . here's how. He also has the (surprising) stats on various money operations linked with criminal organizations (drugs, gambling, etc.). A good primer."
4,Interesting magazine,"I am a new subscriber to Real Simple magazine and have only received the first few issues, but so far I have enjoyed them. I have read a lot of the critical reviews of the magazine, and while I agree that many of the products shown in the magazine are on the expensive side, it is possible to find lesser expensive similar items that do the same job. Its the idea, the ""plans"" that make this magazine unique and help make life a little easier. And to me, that makes it a magazine worth reading"
1,Real Simlpe,I used to like this magazine. It has really changed and not for the better.I have told friends not to buy it any more.
5,Each issue is better than the last!,"Fantastic magazine full of great information, tips, tricks, decorating ideas, sensible & realistic fashion! Highly recommended...one for you and one for a friend, too!"
2,Bad start...,"On my new one-year subscription to Real Simple, the December issue arrived on December 29. When I asked them to give me credit or extend my subscription, they said no. I like this magazine, but I'm really quite annoyed that they think it's okay to start with an already-out-of-date issue, especially December. Not a good start."
5,"Great magazine, prompt delivery",Received magazine promptly. I have read this magazine before and happy to be getting it at such a good price.Amazon.com is always a great place to purchase.
1,Not pleased with receiving the Dec. issue on Dec. 27,"I subscribed to the magazine because I enjoy reading it very much and had purchased and read the Dec. issue. My subscription was to start in Jan. 2012 and would run through and include Dec. 2012. I received my 1st issue on Dec. 27th. This was the ""holiday issue"" filled with gifts to purchase for Christmas and foods to cook for Christmas. I felt it was ""old"" because everything was geared to the buildup for Christmas Day - Dec. 25th. And I had read the magazine already. So now I feel I am shorted on my subscription as the one-year would end with the Nov. 2012 issue and not with the Dec. 2012 issue. Also I do not like the fact that it automatically renews. If I want to cancel I need to make sure that I remember to track when my subscription ends so I can cancel it."
1,Real Simple (1 year),"Ordered this for my wife for Christmas. Was ordered on 10-31-10. Took them no time to send through my credit card charge. Is 12-29-10, and still have not received the first issue. Merry Christmas !!"
5,What a deal!!,"I watch my local fox station here in Central Florida while I'm eating breakfast before work. Everyday they include a segment called ""Deal of the Day"". It tells you about deals or coupons companies are offering. One day last month, a 12 month subscription to Real Simple was offered for $5.00!! Thats almost what you would pay at the store for one issue. Got my first issue today. Definitely check around to see if something similar is offered in your area. Now a days, we need all the breaks we can get especially if we're to continue spending money."
5,Great magazine,I really enjoy the Real Simple magazine because it is filled to the brim with all kinds of interesting and helpful hints.
2,great concept,"This magazine has a great concept, some good ideas, and some pretty good articles. However what I noticed (I actually counted one) only 20 pages in the entire mag. had no ad on it. I could not easily find articles and most of the articles had ads in the margins. A big turn off for me."
3,ok,"...the magazine itself, it was okay. They do give some good advice, some articles are worth reading, and they do focus on spiritual things. One issue had a section where they explained the beliefs of different religions, and there are ""tips"" but its more like advertisement for the products than help for the readers.The photography is beautiful, but there are better magazines out there. They do showcase expensive products, and their not obssessed with fashion, guy advice, and fitness like most women's magazines do. Still I wouldn't call it ""simplistic."" I think it targets a 30-40s something woman, middle class to upper middle class, stay at home and career women. I didn't agree with one article that they had that lying was okay under certain circumstances, so that was a moral issue for me. Read it at the library first. There's nothing simplistic about this magazine, although they do have useful articles on organization."
4,what's not to like?,"I love the whole concept of this magazine: how to simplify your life. This magazine always inspires me to enjoy the every day pleasures more and helps me get organized. And unlike other magazines, I find myself actually using the information in the Real Simple articles: what to save and what to throw out when cleaing your closet, tasty simple recipes, how to look fashionable without spending a lot of time on getting dressed. Small changes that can be made in everyday life which make a difference. My only complaint: at times, the magazine is a bit too spiritual for my taste. A great gift for any busy woman!"
2,Read it at the Library,"Had a subscription for a couple of years, and enjoyed it at first. But after a while it seemed like a lot of money to pay for a lot of ads and articles about things I could not afford, so I didn't renew it. I liked the style and the idea of simplifying one's space and life, and the recipes were yummy. My local library carries it, so once in a while I go there and browse the latest issue and make notes if there happens to be an internet link of interest or a product or recipe worth trying out. I do that with a lot of magazines--if I feel like it. I find that as I get older my style is more established and confident and streamlining comes naturally. It's ""real simple"" to simplify if you don't have too much crap to start with!"
2,"There's no ""there"" there.","This magazine is great, once. After that, I'm kind of left wondering who subscribes to get the same thing, month after month. The photography and styling are beautiful, but the articles are superficial and many of the ideas, silly. For example, is it really a time or energy saver to take a photo of your shoes and attach it to the outside of the shoebox, rather than to take a Sharpie and write ""blue suede flats"" on it? How many times can you reorganize your closets/bathrooms or buy new storage containers? I find, when I've read Real Simple, that I come away with a tip or two per issue, maybe. It's fun for a mindless half-hour in the waiting room at the doctor's office. Nothing worth a year's subscription."
1,"Anti-breastfeeding, pro-consumerism","What a bunch of hogwash. This magazine promotes rampant consumerism, and it's absolute worst stance is that you can ""simplify"" your life by not breastfeeding your newborn. Breastfeeding is the most simple and rewarding of acts that a mother can engage in. As a full time working mom, I never found breastfeeding to be a bother or chore. Worse, is Real Simples' response to reader's critics of this article, from which one sample is ""But one thing is for certain: it is never appropriate to breast-feed in public expecially on the subway. ""What? It is never appropriate to breast-feed in public? A mother's right to breastfeed in public is protected BY LAW in most states. Get real."
2,Disappointment,"This magazine is not about simple living. I don't know where they got the title. Save your money if you are looking for a magazine helpful to a simpler lifestyle. This one is buy, buy, buy!..."
3,For people who want to feel good about themselves...,"I WANT to like this magazine, but just can't quite manage. It always strikes me as written for people who are all about appearance, who want to pretend they are living a simple, eco-friendly lifestyle to be trendy, not because they really believe in it. I picture readers who are willing to spend a lot of money to give the appearance of being thrifty and hip.If you are living a simple lifestyle because you REALLY have to budget your money, this is not such a useful magazine. I couldn't even begin to afford most of what they recommend, and a lot of it doesn't seem that simple to me."
3,Not as good as before,"10 plus years ago I loved this magazine, now I find that it just recycles the same old. I did not mean to renew it was auto renewal on Amazon. For first time readers could find it interesting, but for me nothing new."
3,It's 50/50 for me,"There's a lot I like about this magazine and some that I don't. There are a lot of ads and a lot of crafty things I don't do. But I really like the personal interest and the cooking articles. There are some good tips and a lot of nice decorating ideas. I wouldn't buy a subscription myself, but happened to get it as a gift."
2,"Used to be a good magazine, now its all ads.",This magazine used to have great home tips and recipes. Now its all ads and few actual tips on living real simple.I have subscribers remorse.
3,"Pretty good, but not great","I ordered this magazine for a year for $5. I guess I was under the impression that the title would describe what the magazine was about. I found that to not be the case. I like articles about how to save money & buy inexpensive things, etc. The items that are advertised in Real Simple are incredibly expensive, and certainly not anything that I would consider (or even be able) to buy. However, they do have interesting articles, and I am interested in the recipes. I will continue my subscription, since it was such a deal, but I will not renew my subscription again."
4,Real Simple Mag.,This magazine is great - good articles and great recipes and more. I have made this wonderful salmon recipe that I found in February 2010 issue that impressed my family and friends and it was so simple to make. The price that I got from Amazon was something wonderful as well....
4,Simple Life,My first issue arrived. There are a lot of good articles and I know I will be looking forward to each issue.
1,Magazine order for Real Simple,I'm still waiting to see my first copy. What a disappointment as I really wanted to read the January issue!
5,"A ""Grown-up"" Magazine","I bought my first copy of ""Real Simple"" on a whim, and I've bought it every month since. I like it because unlike so many of the ""women's"" magazines out there (""Glamour,"" ""Cosmopolitan,"" etc.), it deals with real everyday issues. I'm not yet out of college, and I'm not married, but this magazine has given me tons of information that I can use now, and I even learned to knit as a result of the most recent issue. I've also taken lots of things from it that I know will be helpful when I do get out of school, get married, and have a family. This is simply an amazing publication."
1,Beautiful Sofisticated Gloss But Not Unique!,"I subscribed to Real Simple when first published. I thought I was going to get something unique and totally different from the usual women's magazines. At first sight it seems unique, however, it offers the same things as Ladies' Home Journal, Good Housekeeping, Better Homes & Gardens, etc. Real Simple also has articles, recipes, fashions, home decorating. The difference is in the presentation (very sofisticated, artsy photos, quasi-intillectual articles, fashions with unrealistic price tags, etc.). Some may view this as unique. Don't be fooled.After 10 issues I did not renew the subscription, since I can get the same thing in less expensive mags and presented in a non-pretentious ""realy"" simple way."
3,Too simple...,"I got a subscripton to this magazine based on its looks and title 'Real Simple.' The magazine did have some valid articles I would call ""keepers"" however these were far and few between the many advertisements. Many of the articles seemed to have a point but then would specifically point out what item to use being a particular brand. Who knows if the products advertised were any good since it seems they were being paid to gear articles toward using certain brand products? I admit the magazine always has great covers definitely acceptable to leave on the front room coffee table but other than that, it won't even keep your attention even the whole time while you wait in a doctor's office. I would recommend looking elsewhere if you are getting a magazine you actually want to get something out of."
2,Not what it appears to be.,"I thought I would like Real Simple when I borrowed an issue from a friend. There were some interesting ideas, especially from reader contributions. But as I read through it I realized that it's much more consumer-oriented than it appears to be. Most of the ways to ""simplify"" your life involve buying more things. And honestly, does accumulating pretty boxes and gadgets simplify life? I'm holding off from one star because there are nuggets of good advice hidden between the attractive sales pitches, but this is definitely a magazine to skim through at the library rather than to subscribe to - especially since the subscription price is a hefty $$ for 10 issues."
3,No thank you,"Oh please. One of the first issues had an article about how to do your laundry. This magazine is marketed towards the younger Martha Stewart set. If you are part of this crowd, and you haven't heard of separating your whites and your colors, you shouldn't be wasting your money on this magazine. Although, the editors make a concerted effort to be pretty, this is banal stuff."
1,Too Simple,"The cover of this magazine is beautiful, and more than once I've been sucked in (I think I even had a subscription the first year) but none of the articles are ever memorable. If you'd never read a magazine before, perhaps the articles would offer something, but I think most of us are looking for some new ideas."
1,how long does it take to ship the dang thing?,"I would love to review this product as requested by Amazon, but I ordered it in January and now it is the second week of May and I still haven't got it, and now I look at see I won't be getting any issues until APRIL? Really. I won't be ordering magazines through Amazon again."
4,Most practical mag I've found,This is a great magazine with articles and ads I can actually use. My husband even likes to read it.
3,Good tips that quickly leave your memory...,"I love the layout and dare I say, even the ads that feature new products to buy (uber-consumer that I am!), but there is one issue I have with this magazine that makes it less than perfect. The awesome tips they give you every month are quickly read, but if you don't have any use for them at that moment, they quickly leave your memory, unused and forgotten. I admit I collect the issues, but I don't really browse through past issues in any systematic way to see what useful info I can garner in the here and now. I do use the recipes, which come out fabulous most of the time! I guess I have a love-hate relationship with this one."
4,I like it!,"Every month when I get Real Simple in the mail, I read it cover to cover, usually within a couple days of getting it. I have applied many of their ideas to my life (especially cleaning and decorating tips) and have found some ideas and products that truly do simplify my life. I have been inspired by some of the articles about women facing adversity, and I always enjoy the feature in which they present a person (or family) currently needing help financially and otherwise and then outline financial and other advice given for the situation. I have gained ideas to apply to my own life.The only part I don't care for is the clothing articles, just because it seems to be aimed more toward high-end (read: expensive) clothes and I just can't imagine paying $150 for a blouse, no matter what it is made out of."
2,Excelent reading once in a while,"I subscribed to this, and enjoyed the 1st issue I received. It is well laid out, has short, interesting articles, and even a bookmark! However, by the time the 2nd issue came, it felt like a re-hash of the 1st- plus I realized the magazine seemed more the half full of ads. Now, I enjoy looking at the ads and discovering new products, but this was a little ridiculous. I felt like everytime I opened the magazine, I was looking at the ads, and not the articles. Perhaps they have to have all the ads because circulation isn't very wide - I was really disappointed in the end, and canceled my subscription, not even able to get half way through my 2nd issue."
3,Nice magazine... Sometimes,"I buy this magazine only when i know i can actually get some useful information out of it, I always get my hands on a coupon and use it in a wholesale store (such as bj's) which brings the price down so low I get no use from a subscription. I do find that they encourage purchases from things that are simply not necessary ... in many cases they're cheaper and better products. I have chosen to subscribe to BHG, FamilyCircle, and All You. BHG gives me ideas for my home on a budget, FamilyCircle gives me the food recipes (along with BHG) and All You is mainly for the coupons, which will pay itself back within a month! By the way, if you are able to find a good special on each of these subscriptions it will cost you less than a RealSimple subscription alone!"
1,Went Downhill Quickly,"I purchased RS for the first time at the grocery store. Immediately subscribed. Loved it. Soon after, more ads were showing up than articles and those d*** perfume strip inserts sealed the deal on my decision to not purchase another issue nor recommend your magazine to anyone. ""Real Simple"" conjures up images and ideas that are the opposite of what you currently offer in your magazine."
2,Disappointed in the deverely,"I received my first issue of Real Simple magazine the Jan. issue, the week after Christmas . The next one came Jan 3.It was the Dec issue (who needs this one now). It was torn and a mess. On my Lable it says my subscription is up in Nov.I will be short the Dec. issue. I guess they count the Dec. Issue I just received as #12. I will not order any more subscriptionsUntil this is corrected."
1,Breastfeeding a waste of time???????,"I've been somewhat skeptical of this magazine since it's intial publication and I must admit that I still have a few laying around the house (not for long!), but a most recent article in the August 2003 issue ""20 Rules to Break Now"" has absolutely sent me over the top.I am a proudly breastfeeding mother who truly understands how healthy, SIMPLE and economical it really is. I have friends who have to formula feed and I hear nothing but complaints about time cleaning bottles, mixing formula, late night feedings, is my baby eating enough....etc. Tsk, tsk on Real Simple for daring to write an article such as this and actually having the nerve to publish it. I will no longer be a reader of this magazine."
1,never received subscription,"I signed up for this subscription in December, and two months later, i haven't received a single issue! I smell a rip-off."
2,I don't know if it's a great magazine!,"I ordered this magazine on Nov. 26th. Today is Feb. 6th. After 10 weeks, I haven't received a copy of the magazine. I ordered several different magazines that day and I have received the rest of them (some of them, I've already received two copies!). So, I honestly can not rate the magazine; just the experience with how long it is taking to get a copy."
1,Never received product,"Ordered this Real Simple Magazine over 2 months ago. Still no magazine. I love this magazine, but its hard to love something that you don't have a chance to look at it."
1,Real Simple,"I would love to write a Review,but I have not received my ""Real Simple Magazine"" I placed my order in early July so I sure hope I get this soon......"
5,Love this magazine!,"I love this magazine! It has down to earth ideas that are easy to use. The pictures are great, and the stories are interesting and applicable! What an amazing offer through Amazon!"
4,Cindy,"No magazine has better recipes than this one. RS makes sure their recipes are delicious, nutritious and easy to follow.I love this magazine and so does my boyfriend."
2,still waiting for REAL SIMPLE,"it is hard to review a magazine that STILL has not arrived.purchace was made on november 30th 2009.today is feburary 1 2010.i hope that i don't recieve a bundle of past editions at one time so that they can ""catch up"".i am trying to be patient...but it's not... REAL SIMPLE!"
4,Great magazine,Love Real Simple because it is just that...enjoy the many topcs it covers to get lives in order
4,the delivery date has been postponed 4 months,"This magazine has postponed the delivery date 4 months. This is the second time I ordered it, the first subscription from another source, got cancelled by them. The reason I think is that I got it for $5.00 between specials and coupons. I bet they didn't postpone or cancel the subscribers that paid full price...."
5,Very Well Rounded Magazine,"Real Simple is such a great magazine! With recently revamped sections, it provides great tips on a ton of easy and yummy recipes, how to's (such as how to put together a nice dinner party with the yummy recipes), style trends, money/budget management, organizing your home while still keeping it looking trendy, health/beauty and time saving tips on things you probably already do on a daily basis. It is a valuable magazine and you get a great deal by buying it through Amazon.I note a previous review states it recommends unnecessary expensive items. It does for certain budgets, but it also offers cheaper alternatives and that's always good."
2,Worst mag I have ever looked at!,"I thought this would be a great magazine but I am finding it is a lot of ads and useless information. Very small amount of ideas, recipes, suggestions that I have found worthwhile. I am glad I only paid $5 for a 1 yr subscription, I have no intention of renewing this. They have however been coming on time, that's a plus!"
3,Real Simple Magazine,"I only paid $5.00 for a years subscription so I can't be to picky as that was an awesome price. However, for others who may be interested in purchasing this magazine, I will state how I really feel about it. The magazine is large, therefore you would think there would be many noticable articles in it...not so. The vast majority of the magazine is advertisments, the articles are stuck here and there between them. They do not stand out enough and I actually lost interest as I paged through the magazine. For the name ""Real Simple"", it certianly is not simple finding the real content of the magazine.If one third of the ads would be eliminated and the articles kept more centered and together in the magazine, it would be much nicer, more appealing and organized. There are a good variety of topics and that is a plus. I found more content than initially realized after wading through the magazine pages a few times. Most of them were not presented in a catching way, however."
4,A good reading if you are busy,"Being a subscriber of many magazines, this is the one I anticipate arriving every month. My favorite sections are ""New uses for old things"", ""Problem-solving products"", ""Life"". Some of their recipes are delicious! I personally love their Spaghetti with asparagus and hazelnuts.Other than that, there are a lot of advertisements and product placements to sift through, plus some of the articles are recycled from other publications.I would recommend it to a busy person who does not have time surfing the Internet for useful ideas."
4,Good,The Real Simple Magazine provides some great easy dishes/meals that you can make at home. It's a great magazine with worthwhile information.
5,One of the best magazines out there!,"A friend of mine from Seattle showed me her copy of this magazine and a first I was like ""yeah whatever"". But then I started reading it and found it really wonderful. It's so much more refreshing to read than the others out there that tell us how to please a man, how to lose weight so he will love you and stuff like that. I was tired of all that. I wanted something simple and new. I found it in this magazine. It's real, it's simple and it's fun to read. Period."
3,"Real simple, sure...but it's real necessary!","Real Simple gives me all kinds of ""how to's,"" practical advice, and much more, in a tidy volume which is all at once readable, welcoming, helpful and enlightening. Most importantly, it gently (but firmly!) tells me that making change is more than possible, it's do-able. Even for a stubborn and scattered soul like myself!!"
1,Dissapointed with Seller,"I ordered this magazine nearly 3 months ago and have yet to receive my first issue. While I enjoy reading Real Simple, I would not recommend that anyone use this seller to purchase a subscription."
2,Real Expensive,"Apparently, according to this magazine, the simple life can only be enjoyed by the rich. There is rarely an idea in this magazine that will cost you less than $100 to implement or a product featured in the magazine that is affordable by the average person. So, if you want to simplify your life and have the money to wear couture... this is the magazine for you. P.S. Keep having your personal chef prepare your meals, because the recipes from this magazine are a waste of good ingredients... Play-Doh usually has a better taste."
2,BIG Mix-up!,"I ordered this magazine as a gift for my daughter on November 30 and paid for it at the time. I thought everything was straight. In February, I received a bill in the mail from Real Simple with a much higher price than I agreed to pay and my credit card had already been charged. I called Real Simple and it took 4 different people and it seems they had married my order with one my neighbor had ordered. Eventually, I got my order straight, and told them to contact my neighbor. Eventually, my daughter received her first copy at the end of February. 3 months was a long time to wait for an order. I'm not sure my neighbor ever got her order straight!"
1,i got ripped off,"I cant honestly review this magazine since I never got it. I purchased it for some great deal at $5.00 for a year subscription, but never received it.. I guess the REAL SIMPLE part is believing such a good deal..guess I'm REAL SIMPLE."
1,NEVER RECEIVED MAGAZINE,"I ordered this magazine on Nov 30th and still have not received my first issue. When I ordered Allure magazine through Amazon, I received my first issue in two weeks."
1,Never received this magazine!,I ordered Real Simple on 11/30. Today is 2/1/2010. I have yet to receive an issue of this magazine.
1,no show,"What a novel idea, asking me to rate an item I have not yet received after one month of no delivery. When can I expect delivery?"
2,Unknown,"I purchased this a month ago and haven't yet received any copies. Soooo, the only review I can give at this point is their shipping is slow."
4,Get over the name of the magazine already!,"Can anyone say ""creative license""?Anyway, I read this magazine exclusively - no more MS for me! Though the last issue wasn't great, the menus are usually delicious and easy, the tips are great, and the pictures are artfully done. I recommend this highly for anyone who is interested in home decor and cooking."
3,Middle of the Road,"For years I enjoyed reading Real Simple for it's comparison articles, life tips, and quick/easy recipes. However, recently I realized that more and more of the articles weren't really helpful or interesting. The products recommended to 'simplify' were expensive and would just add clutter to my home. The recipes weren't that tasty when I made them at home and I felt many of the recommendations were actually paid advertisements in disguise. So, I allowed my subscription to run out and browse their website once in a while."
2,Haven't received subscription yet!!!,"I already know I love Real Simple, so that's why I gave this two stars. Unfortunately, I have yet to receive a magazine since I ordered the subscription. I know the typical time is 5-8 weeks but I am on week #10 now with nothing!"
1,I was lured to subscribed this magazine,"Real Simple used to be useful when it first launched with all the simple hints for housekeeping and errands in the house. However, the magazine now has 80-90% pages full of advertisement and very little useful tips. I was lured to subscribe to this magazine from Amazon with $5 subscription for a year. I regretted to have it even though it is only $5."
5,read cover to cover each month,"I've received this magazine for 4 years as a gift subscription and ADORE each publication. After I have kept each issue for 2 years (re-reading most issues) then I recycle to my employers' breakroom and share. Stimulates good conversation, promotes better health ideas and even finds the young (meaning the high school age employees) reading and talking about ideas. Thank-you to all the editors that contribute."
2,A little pricey,This is a very nice magazine. I've been getting it for my daughter for a few years. Price I paid this year was more than twice as much as an offer that came from Sunset Magazine right after I'd placed the order with Amazon. Oh well. Usually find Amazon is extremely competitive so I'll give them this one!
1,Blah!,"I can organize much better than the ideas in this book, I'm learning to trust my own judgment and my own ideas rather than a book!"
3,Fun ideas,"I like this magazine. I think that some of the stuff they do wouldn't work on a small budget, but I like to see how they put things together then try to recreate it for cheaper."
3,Magazine a 10; service? not so much!,"I LOVE this magazine from having purchased it on the newsstands almost every month. With the discount price offered, I couldn't pass up a subscription.Unfortunately, I have yet to receive an issue, or any confirmation of my order, other than an email from Amazon, and the money being removed from my bank account.I'm hoping to get a full 12 months of reading love..."
2,Spend! Spend! Spend!,"This magazine should really be titled ""Better Living Through Buying Stuff."" It's beautifully designed but during the course of my subscription, the only important thing I've learned is how to fold a sweater. I will not be renewing."
3,A gift no feedback,"No feedback from the female recipient. But like most magazine subscriptions, the vendors are still hounding me several years later to renew."
3,Gave as a gift - autorenewal came very early,"I gave this subscription as a gift for my mom. She said the magazine was good but did not want to renew. That was OK with me since the renewal posted to our credit card at least 4 months before the first year of subscription was set to expire so I cancelled the auto-renewal, hopefully without any difficulty."
2,Disappointed,When I ordered My new subscription I expected it to start with the February issue since december issue washout and January was on its way. Instead I gotdecembers issue. I would like my subscription changed to February. Thanks
2,zzzZZZ,"I used to enjoy this magazine, but I just think it is boring. Every issue has the same feeling and recycled stories and ideas from back issues. All magazines have their flaws, but this one is just so milquetoast! Its flaw is being boring...I can't recommend it anymore."
4,"Upscale, worldly but domestic mag for women","I LOVE ""Real Simple"". When I was growing up, my mother read ""Family Circle"" and ""Women's Day"" -- magazines that seem hopelessly dated. For me, this is the modern, classy equivalent. RS offers cleaning tips, decorating tricks, and recipes, but the recipes span American classics and a wide range of ethnic cooking. It provides practical advice that many of us should have learned from our parents but didn't, like how to handle a confrontation or comfort a grieving friend. The photography is gorgeous and the amount of content has been increasing as the magazine gets to its feet (I've been a subscriber from the first issue). Sure, some articles are simplistic and naive, but I don't mind paging through them to find the gems."
1,Poor shipping serice,"I ordered this product and received an email saying I would receive the first issue by Nov. 16th. I have not received anything yet and currently have no way of tracking this. If you want to wait for 8 weeks before receiving an issue.... buy this subscription. Considering they have issues upon issues sitting in their warehouse, this is poor service. Do not buy from this seller."
1,Lame,"My wife got this and I briefly thumbed through it. Not really thrilled, more orientated to the female audience. I can't speak for her, but she didn't renew her subscription."
5,Very useful magazine,"The first time I saw this magazine I was reading it in the waiting room. Real Simple is packed (almost 300 pages) full of useful hints. It is, by far, one of the best subscriptions we have."
4,Real Simple,"My gift to me-once done, it goes to my sister-in-law. Might as well have a guilty pleasure that you can share."
4,Attractive Layout ~ Helpful Information,"I signed up sight unseen based on information I found here on the Site. I'm pleased with my choice. I've found a few recipes to try. I've found some helpful hints for organizing and home decorating. I'm finding this magazine not only useful, but also attractively formatted in a way that makes it easy to read. I appreciate that this magazine isn't filled with tons of images, funky font to waste space, and articles split up over ten pages when it could fit on one page."
3,Used to be better,"My husband and I both used to enjoy this magazine, but now it has become much like any other women's magazine: beauty, fashion, and food. The original premise: living simply, has been lost, in my opinion. However, I did buy some Target Home (top of the line) sheets at their suggestion and they are better than any sheets I've ever purchased, including much more expensive brand names. So I trust their take on various products. Not enough home decorating, projects, or ideas to simplify life and live on less. I'm not sorry I bought it because it only cost me about $5 for a year! But many of the issues I just pass on to my adult daughter without reading the entire magazine. I'm in my late 50's, daughter is in her late 20's and she loves it."
2,No delivery,"I ordered this before Christmas and although other subscriptions that were ordered at the same time have started delivery, I have not yet received a single issue."
3,"might enjoy it, if it would show up in my mailbox","I was really looking forward to getting this magazine, and at a $5. yearly subscription was REALLY excited....but alas, it is now the end of January and I have not rec'd a magazine yet. I won't order from an Amazon vendor again. The website is hard to navigate to register a complaint and no one seems to care. Good bye $5 parting is such sweet sorrow."
2,Real Simple?,"Don't get me wrong..I love the two hard cover books, Real Simple Solutions and Real Simple: The Guide to Organized Living. They are gems. However, the magazine simply betrays it's words. As one rater stated, it seems like the reader is cajoled into buying un-needed expensive products, and my god..the magazine is cluttered with ads and inserts, plus it is very hard to turn the pages and read. I realize ads are necessary, but this is extreme, especially for a magazine that supposedly promotes a less complicated and cluttered life for it's readers."
2,Real Simple is simply about buying stuff,"I subscribed to this magazine for a year and enjoyed my first few issues, but I soon noticed that all of the ideas for ""leading a simpler life"" involved purchasing expensive products. You might as well just flip through a Pottery Barn catalog. They both offer the same fantasy -- ""What a stress-free, genteel life I could lead if only I had closet organizers and all-white furniture!"" Eventually I simplified my life by letting my subscription run out."
2,You've got to be kidding.,"Beautiful photography, but empty articles, and advertising, advertising, advertising. Every item, on every page, is an advertisement. Everything. Every sentence in every article, every caption, every line in the index. There are numerous special sections devoted to product endorsements, although they're phrased as ""tips."" They should give this magazine away for free, considering the money they must make off the advertising. Sure, while it's somewhat ""handy"" to know what's depicted and discussed (usually the URL and price are provided) it makes me a little uneasy. I feel suckered. I feel uncomfortable. Euugh."
2,Real simplistic,"I received a free trial subscription to REAL SIMPLE so I didn't know much about it until my issues began to arrive. I was pleased to receive a very attractive, very substantial-feeling magazine that includes features on ""life, home, body, and soul."" If only the content were as substantial as the paper! Instead, the writing is as spare as the page design. Compared with other magazines geared toward women, Real Simple reminds me of InStyle without the celebrities or Martha Stewart Living made, well, simple. It's pleasant enough to flip through, and contains some good ideas, but there just isn't much to read here."
1,Real Simple Magazine,"I have yet to receive my first copy of this subsription, so at this time, I cannot comment on the magazine or whether I received it in a timely manner."
1,NOT HAPPY!,"I have never recieved the product, not even the 1st issue or any there after, so as of now I'm not happy at all. Please contact me to let me know how we can resolove this issue.Real Simple (1-year)"
2,Lots of Fluff,"This magazine is for rich people. The format is minimalist and is pleasing to the eye, but the content is lacking. There are occasionally some good ideas in it, but it doesn't really fit my lifestyle (I am just a common, average person). Save your money and go with something more practical."
2,Real Simple,"I have not yet received one magazine yet. Ordered Dec 1, 2009. Other magazines ordered the same day have arrived."
1,poor medical advice,"As a working mom and a physician, I look for ways to simplify and relax. I used to subscribe but canceled my subscription. This magazine has medical advice that is not mainstream. And some is risky. Tried and true medical advice may not be ""sexy"" but it should have equal footing to alternative treatments. And non conventional medical advice should be labeled as such."
1,Cluttered with ads!!!!,"This magazine has catchy headlines and very little substance. And its hard to find the actual articles because almost every page is an advertisement. I bought a copy from the checkout because of the titles of the articles, but apparently whoever writes the headlines does not read the articles! The articles were really flimsy. REally useless....Cut down on your clutter, and save a few bucks on this one..."
4,I would like to simplify it even more,"I love the magazine and have read it for years. Like M.S.Living, yes they tout the expensive, but when you're clever you can adjust! My vote is to simplify even more and make the magazine available on the Kindle. It's just as easy to read, it only saves up to so many back issues (unless you tell it otherwise) and it helps reduce clutter around the house!"
1,Had a free trial and canceled it early.,"Had a free trial and canceled the trial early after only two issues. I did not enjoy these magazines at all. Too much of the magazines were focused on subtle to blatant advertizing of items, plus their ideas were no-brainers that I do not need a magazine to discuss or things that no way I would waste time on. I felt that the magazine pushes ""keeping up appearances"" instead of living the simple life which goes completely against its title. Also after that free trail, my junk mail significantly increased so I suspect that they are making money off of my info."
1,save your money,"There are so many ads in this publication that they should pay you to read it! Don't waste your money (and may I add TIME) wading through ads, ads, and more ads............."
1,Stopped working 3 days after return period expired,"I bought this watch on Oct. 18. It stopped working on November 23, three days too late to return it. The last two Timexes I owned stopped working within a year (not a battery issue.) What happened, Timex? You used to be a good brand."
3,Not that big,I bought this for my mother based on the reviews saying it was with large numbers and easy to read. It is not. It is pretty but if you have difficulty seeing this isn't the watch for you.
3,It has a very small face!,"Look at the measurements very carefully. It is tiny with a very short watch band. Easy to read numbers, but again, very small."
5,"So far, so good!","So far, (I have had the watch only a week), I really like this watch...It is a perfect size ( I have a small wrist) and the strap is not too long; the face is easily readable, with numbers vs. dots and it is also quite nice looking. I am pleased, especially because the price was great."
5,Great Casual Watch,This watch is a beautiful ladies' watch for those wanting a thin band (1/4 inch) and a smaller face. The numbers are large for the size of the face and it is easily read-able. The band is a very dark leather color - it could sometimes pass for a deep brown OR black so it matches with all clothing. I have very small wrists and usually have to make extra holes in my watch bands...not this one though - there are 8 holes and I am right in the middle - with 3 holes left to go to make it bigger. I think this band would fit up to a 7 inch wrist. I am very pleased with this product.
5,The Perfect Little Watch,"Classic style and leather, too! The perfect little black watch at the perfect price."
3,I've owned two,"My first was a hand-me-down from my Mom, and when it stopped telling time properly (even with a new battery), I purchased another exact same. Somehow, the glass got broken on the new one after a while, and the band is in need of replacing as it is falling apart in a few places after two years. I wouldn't buy again. It doesn't seem durable enough for me. Too bad, it is delicate enough for my slim wrist, which is hard to come by for me."
5,Wonderful Watch,"I absolutely adore this watch. I have worn this style since college, 35 years ago. It is small enough to be dressy, yet large enough to see the numbers clearly. When I thought I had lost mine, I searched only two days before ordering this new one. I'm not sorry that I found the other one and now I have two. It is a great watch."
2,Timex Watch okay,"The watch was fine until last week when the metal part of buckle broke. Now I have to get another band for it, very simple plain watch. It runs fine has no features other than tell time."
4,A lovely watch for all occasions.,"I've only had this watch for a few days, but I'm partial to Timex watches and so am sure I'll enjoy having this in my watch ""collection"". I am particularly impressed with the band. It is quite thin yet it doesn't feel flimsy in the least. I rated it only 4-star because I haven't worn it often enough to determine its durability."
5,Classic Watch,"This watch is a classic: fits well on smaller wrists, nice smooth edges, comfortable, ease to read and the sweep hand is a plus. As a nurse, I love it!"
2,Band too short,Once again from Amazon... a watch with a short watch band. That's one thing i like about going in a store is they have special long watches you can try on...not having any luck here. Otherwise nice! Band barely meets together on my wrist.
4,"Dainty, pretty watch","This is a very nice watch for the money. I just wish it had the indiglo light source. I have pretty poor vision and in the middle of the night when I want to know what time it is when I am lying awake, it is handy to push the button. Oh well, it is just what it is supposed to be: pretty casual and easily used for dressy."
5,Petite and nice,"Bought this as an everyday watch for my wife and she loves it. It's small and effective for everyday use, and with it's shape, it can even be used on dressy occasions."
5,gelatin brain mold,"I ordered this mold to use in connection with a social skills lesson in my classroom. My students loved it! I used the recipe on the back of the box and the jello was incredibly strong. There were two things I would suggest. #1. It took more jello to fill the mold than the recipe indicated.#2 If you want to float worms or other things inside, put them in immediately. I wanted to float some laminated paper strips with ""brain functions"" inside the jello, so as with normal jello, waited for it to partially set up. Instead, it set up almost immediately. As a result, my little strips of paper were all on the bottom of the brain."
4,LOVE MY ZOMBIE,"I BOUGHT THIS Zombie Brain Gelatin Mold FOR GELATIN AND FLAN, AND IT'S VERY COOK, MY HUBBY LOVES IT, EASY TO CLEAN."
5,BRAAAAAAAIIIIIIINNNNNNSSSSSSSS!!!,"I ordered this for the centerpiece (well, the Jello mold will be the centerpiece) of the food we're serving at a zombie themed birthday party.The box comes with two receipes on the back: one for a realistic looking gray brain and the other for a ""more fun"" gummie worm/bug infested brain.We plan to make both and they should go over really well!The mold is a tad thin, so you have to be careful with it. But, I think with normal useage, we could get plenty of years of brainy goodness out of this lil' gelatin mold! :)"
2,best for really young children...not much to it...,"I was really disappointed. My 6 year old thinks it's neat, but doesn't understand how limited the learning possibilities are for him. The box claimed 10 different experiments. They are primarily about mixing colors...so not as educational as we'd hoped for. There is one about hot vs. cold water activity with the colors, one using milk and another one with the crystals...the rest are basically just color mixing. So I'd say really about 3, just OK experiments. Knowing this I think it's not worth over $5...if you can get one that cheap and you're children are young, then it's worth it. Otherwise, it's a waste of time and money."
4,My 8 year old niece loved it,"My 8 year old niece loved it. She started doing experiments with it right away, with all the excitement of her other birthday gifts."
3,Squishy Crystals,"Great set of experiments to teach kids about colors and interactions. But the crystals at the end are squishy and not true crystals. My daughter was dissapointed and no longer wants anything to do with this kit, even though there are enough colors for 3 more sets. Squishy crystals freaked her out a bit. (She's 5, we did this together)"
4,Fun for the whole family,"My 4 year old was ready for the magic of science, so this seemed to be perfect. More parental participation was required that I intended. Also many experiments had to be done in bunches, which took a little more time than we had planned at that moment."
4,pulkas are the kings of British metal,"Pulkas rock. its that simple. Songs like Betrayal and Hippy Fascist kick you in the face with their ferocity and live the intensity is 10 times worse. IF YOU LIKE THESE THEN CHECK OUT EARTHTONE 9- THEIR ALBUM ""LOW DEF(INITION) DISCHORD"" IS THE HEAVIEST THING I HAVE HEARD SINCE KORN!"
1,watch for compatibility!!,"If you have a Fuji s7000, you need a 5 volt power supply. Note that the travel kit does not specify whether it is the 5V or the 3V that many other Fuji cameras use. To reassure their customers they won't have any hassles, Amazon needs to mention the 5volt in the ad....Rick J."
1,Travel kit only for places that use 110 V electricity,This was disappointing. The power adapter for the charger only operates on 110 volt electricity. That makes it useless for travel in most of the world outside the US.
1,Only camera case arrived!,"I ordered this 'kit' from ""cjtownsellsresale"". They only sent the camera case (there were no batteries or charger). This is false advertising in my opinion. When taking into account the shipping charge, it would have been better to get a nicer case for about the same price anywhere else."
5,Raphael es mi cantante favorito de todos los tiempos desde que yo estaba pequeño.,"Me gusta muchas las canciones de Raphael, sus peliculas tambien. El es mi heroe. Tengo mucha musica de el lo mismo que sus peliculas. Raphael es mi cantante favorito."
4,Still Getting Used to the Series,"I am still a little confused and am getting used to the series. The second volume was better for me, but I grew to love XXXHolic so I'm giving this one a chance."
3,"Not bad, but more photos needed","Overall the book is ok, however for a coffee table sized book (It's rather tall, which makes it awkward to store in a bookcase - well mine anyway) there's not enough photos, and a bit too much text. Almost all of the photos I'd seen before, so while most people new to the Bond world might be impressed, there's not enough unique content to make the book a must have. Actually come to think of it most of the text does seem like filler, too generic to be interesting. A book this size shouldn't be a novel, it should be mostly photos. With only one or two photos per actress there definitely needs to be a lot more photos."
3,I believe someone's math is off...,"Specs:Item Weight: 4 PoundsHeight: 31 millimetersLength: 10.5 centimetersWidth: 9.2 centimetersA square shouldn't be a centimeter by three centimeters and I have a hard time believing this tiny product weighs a whole FOUR POUNDS! Other than that, for a basic piston tool, it should do the job."
3,Not for VW/Audi,"I used a similar product on my 2004 Jetta Wagon and this tool doesn't fit the grooves at all. Too narrow for the VW piston. Tool could work with others, just not with VW products. Just FYI..."
1,Not worth it.,I bought this to do the rear brakes in my 2005.5 B7 Audi S4 and it took about 30-40 minutes to get the first piston back in. The tool kept slipping out and the edges started getting rounded off. By the time I was doing the other side I gave up and rented one of the tools that has multiple adapters for a better fit. It took all of 5 minutes. I wish I had just bought the $30 tool like that from here in the first place. Not worth the pain in my hand and time.
5,Great Tool,"I have access to a fully stocked automotive tool room but on this occasion wanted to fix the brakes in the driveway. Have seen the kits that have a separate piece for each disc brake piston configuration. This tool is compact and has all 6 on one cube. Attached the 3/8 ratchet and screwed the piston back into the caliper - it worked like a charm at about $10, this tool was a great investment."
5,Great Book About World War II Courage,"Based upon hundreds of interviews and his personal experience as a Radioman and Gunner for U.S. Navy VPB Patrol Squadron 23 in the Pacific during World War II, Don Klotz portrays in colorful fashion the heroism and sacrifices of the brave members of his PBY Squadron from a period prior to Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, to the time of surrender of the Japanese on the Battleship U.S.S. Missouri in 1945. At the time of his entry in the U.S. Navy, Don Klotz was only 17 years old, and when he was discharged in 1945 he was 20 years old, still too young to have a farewell alcoholic beverage with some of his former shipmates in a San Diego bar. It took Mr. Klotz more than 8 years to develop and chronicle the interviews and log entries of hundreds of members of his PBY Squadron, many of whom are now deceased."
4,Seems to work...,"This is a no name product. It has a ""warranty"" but no address or real business name or other information on where you would send it for ""warranty"" coverage, other than somewhere in China. I've only used it once but it worked. Some of these devices have fuses - I can't tell if this one does. The package does indicate you should not exceed 10 amps so I don't know how long it would last if you were running a DVD player, laptop, etc. It's also awkward to have this gizmo plus two big adapter plugs sticking out of the car socket. The package also makes it clear that you cannot plug a cigarette lighter into this ""cigarette lighter adapter."" Go figure."
3,For Umbrella Strollers ONLY,"When I purchased this, the description did not state that it was for umbrella strollers. I bought to use with my Contours stroller, but it is not compatible. The fact that it is for umbrella strollers is clearly written on the packaging, though (again) not on the amazon.com description.Also, since my vehicle has a deep trunk area, my arms are short (I am 5'1) it is not a comfortable reach. I think if I had one of those small crossover SUV's, I could try to make do. As it stands, not useful to me."
4,It work great if ur trunk is small,I love the idea but it just not working very well if u have a suv that have large back room.I own a mdx so everytime I want to tie the stroller in place I have to climb in the car.But it very tidy and give u ALOT more space.so I still using it .
3,Great if you have a Minivan,"**You must have removable headrests to use this item!!**I got this thinking it would make the back of my Durango so much roomier. I figured I could hang this from the back of the seats and the stroller would be contained. What I didn't count on was the space between the gate opening and the ""contained stroller"". This product is great perfect and wonderful, if the seats that stroller are suspended from are not 4 feet from your back gate. If you have a drop down back seat with REMOVABLE HEADRESTS in your car, or a minivan, this item is perfect. If you have more than 1 foot of space between the back gate and the back seat, this will be a trial."
2,Dissapointed...Excellent Illustrations.,"Loved the illustrations, but if you want a Winnie the Pooh book with all the witty stories and charm of the original author (Milne), this book isn't it. This book is more of a school age reader. If you are purchasing it for a reader, then great...4 stars, but the stories are more of a girlscout-type mere shadow of the original A.A. Milne. Just not what I expected I suppose."
3,Less is more,"How can the best music from one of the best bands of all time not make a fantastic Greatest Hits album? If you tamper with the music, that's how.I listened to this and somehow didn't feel right. The CD gathered dust for more than a year, and when I ""rediscovered"" it, didn't feel like playing it. ""Made in Japan"" however...The simple fact is that Deep Purple's music should be listened to the way it was intended to. I still maintain that their live albums are their best albums. Check out the excellent digitally remasteredMade In Japan: The Remastered Edition, or check out the DVD section. This one is best avoided."
2,Problem With Gilmour 998FB,"We have two Gilmour sprinklers, 998FB and 998ZS. Both have the same problem. They get stuck at one end of the range of coverage if water pressure is not at its peak. If you do not have consistently high pressure you might want to try another model."
1,Poor copy of the real thing - better off at a salvage yard,"This is a cast iron replica, not cast aluminum like the original. The item pictured here is not an entirely accurate depiction of what I received. The cast iron hose nipples are excessively large in diameter, making it VERY VERY hard to put on the heater hose. It finally went on with some Lithium grease and immense effort. The result was that the heater hose is stretched too much and thin right next to the clamp. Not satisfactory.Oh, and yes I was using the proper diameter hoses(!)The extra diameter affects the radiator hose a little less so, but it was also stretched.The other problem is that this weighs 10 times what the aluminum version does. Not easily cracked, I'll admit though.Avoid and look for NOS or a junkyard pull."
2,Nice layout BUT...,"No expense spared in the printing of this book. Well layed out, nice pictures taken with soft focus lense. All to make up for its lack of depth. Projects more suited for a childrens art and craft book. Not for the experienced stamper or card maker. Beginers would grow out of this book very quickly. Here is an example of why. One of the projects is to cut out the shape of a butterfly (and I mean basic shape)and then to stick onto it about nine shiny plastic gems. This project takes up two pages. You would be better off spending a few more dollars and buying Handcrafted Cards from Elegant to Whimsical by Paige Gilchrist."
4,Book with Ideas,"I am glad that I bought this book. Although it doesn't give an introduction of materials used, (it does get into the details of the project from first chapter!) it is a very down-to-earth book that gives the reader plenty of ideas to achieve professional and sophisticated results in a card. These are the two main criteria that must be met when I buy a Stamping book.I also recommend other stamping fans out there these other books which I enjoy reading:- Stamp in Color (Dave Brethauer, Stamp with Style (Kathryn Perkins), Rubber Stamp Celebrations (this one doesn't have good instructions but it would be good to get the inspiration needed to make great looking cards!)"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book and returned it the next day, most cards resemble exerpt 3 (look inside) I found the cards to be unimaginative and boring."
2,Don't judge a book by its cover.,"I'm a crafter and have made my own greeting cards for many years. I expected more out of this book than what I got. True, this book has a good layout and the pictures are pretty, but it's dull and it didn't light my creative fire. I'm truly disappointed that I wasted my money on this one."
2,Not much substance...,"I was disappointed with this book. Although it's beautifully laid out, there isn't a lot here that's new. In addition, I found the directions lacking, and was disappointed in the lack of attention paid to the supplies needed."
4,Very informative!,"This book will teach you how to get your shadows right, to express the fur of animals, their body, their face. It explains how to shade simple objects, how to draw without thinking of the result, with the help of a grid. It teaches you how to render the different parts of the bodies of very different animals. For me it was a great help, I really think it can help out beginners in making their drawings more realistic."
3,Great BEFORE you build,"This book has wonderful design ideas if you are working with an architect designing a new home, if you are or remodeling an old one. If you already have a home and want to incorporate her ideas, it might be a little difficult. It is a very educational book with beautiful photos, however, I wouldn't recommend it if you aren't planning on doing any major renovation or construction."
5,A Great Album from A Great Guitarist,"If you're familiar with Nina's playing, then you'll know why you should own this CD. If you haven't yet heard her, then PLEASE make sure you do! I can't stress enough how Nina can make the listener feel such a profound tug at the soul. Her playing can stir up feelings of elation, excitement, joy, wonder at her ability to be technically brilliant and at the same time indescribably soulful, and then make you cry the kind of tears that only talent like hers can do. She speaks volumes through her music and it's on such a feeling level that you simply have to experience it for yourself. She has chosen wisely the other fine musicians for ""NOT BEFORE NOON"", making for a diverse and high quality experience that I can only HIGHLY recommend!"
4,Live vs Studio,"This is just a response to the reviewer below. If you like your music live and mainly for its entertainment value, that's your preference. If something is studio-""crafted,"" it cannot technically be spat out. Listen to Nina Gerber's playing on the Kate Wolf studio catalog."
2,Melon Baller,I purchased this based on the picture which was a bit misleading. The two bowls of the melon baller sit on top of the bracket rather than slightly to the side which makes holding it a bit uncomfortable. I would look at some other one.
5,"The Saluqi, Couring Hound of the East",Beautiful book rich of infos and wonderful illustrations. A MUST for Saluqi fanciers.
2,"Not good for derby, and not as good a deal as they appear.","They are vinyl boots riveted to nylon plates on wheels that two online skate shops actually GAVE AWAY. The Radar Cayman wheels that these come with are said to be basically useless for any purpose. You'll want a bearing upgrade too.But they cost just $99! Yes, but since the wheels are basically useless and decent wheels start at $60 (plus shipping) these $99 skates actually REALLY cost you $159 and up. For a dollar less most online skate shops will sell you Sure-Grip Rebels (leather boots) with long-lasting Probe plates (that aren't riveted) and Fugitive wheels. The same $60 wheels many skaters would upgrade their R3s Caymans to.In other words, pay a buck less than the $159 an R3 actually costs you, and you can have an actual leather boot and better plates."
3,upgrade the toe stop,"a very new skater, and new to derby, i picked these for being fairly cheep and having a wider foot than other skates.they are OK. i don't have anything else to base them on, though.upgrade your toe stop when you buy. they com with ""minis"" and you want a full size toe stop- which means it will have a longer bolt to unscrew."
4,Better than rentals,"I have a pair of these to play roller derby. They specifically say on websites that the are ""get you by"" skates. They are only meant to last a season or 8 months. I think they are pretty comfortable to put on and skate without much breaking in. The ""leather"" skates take months (about 6 months) to break in. If you are just going to the rink and don't want to use the stinky rentals then these aren't bad. The stock wheels aren't that great, but paying $100 for a pair of skates leaves a little extra money to get some decent wheels."
5,weekend fun. . .,"I noticed most people who purchased and reviewed this skate are active in derby. We are not. I bought this skate for my 14 year old who got tired of renting the rentals almost every weekend. My daughter LOVES these skates! She says they ride really smooth, they are fast, comfortable, and they look really good on especially if you change up the laces. Overall, she is pretty happy with them and would get them again."
3,Narrow but priced right,"I bought these when I started Derby because I wasn't sure how serious I was going to get. I don't have a super wide foot, I wear standard width shoes, but these squish my toes. It's ok at first but after 30 laps my pinky toe will go numb and I get foot cramps. If you are just starting they are fine but if you are serious about derby spend the money on a better skate. You'll just end up doing it later anyway."
4,Big fan of Laurell's,"I purchased this book because I've read and loved everything I've seen by Laurell. The book was kind of slow going in the beginning for me and I was wondering if I was going to like it at all, but by the end I couldn't put it down and was begging for a sequel. I even sent a message to the author asking her if she was planning on writing one."
3,Confusing but decent read.,"Nightseer was an ok read but it was certainly far from a wonderful or compelling read.Keleios was the typical unstoppable sorceress main character. The wounds she takes, and lives from, the enemies she fights, and the magic she spells is all straight from a Dungeons and Dragons video game. Her character is night invincible and she ALWAYS pulls off her spells whenever she needs to. 'Oh oh, the slime monster is coming but i need to finish this spell or else i will die!' (Spell is pulled off and saves her with a second to spare). Rinse and repeat through the novel.Also, what was with her relationship with Lothar? Did she want to kill him? Was she slowly growing to like him?And Nesbit? I thought he was a major villain that needed killing? But no, he is Keleios' brother-in-law and we never see him ever again...Nesbit screams for a sequel down the line but we shall see...All in all it was a average read but this was Hamiltons first novel, and it shows."
4,Excellent story,"Laurell K. Hamilton's first effort is every bit as well-written and entertaining as her later works. Keleois Incantare is a captivating, strongwilled herione and the fast paced plotline leaves no time for boredom while allowing for the building of well-defined characters whom you can't help but empathize with. My only complaint (and it seems to be a common one) is the amount of loose ends left at the end of the book. A sequel is easy to envision, and possibly a prequel is well, and if one or the other (particularly the sequel) ever appeared I would be quick to snatch it up. All in all, a fantastic read and well worth buying."
5,A good book with great depth.,"I may be the only person that picked up this book (before it was reprinted) *before* I read any Antia Blake series. I felt that this book had alot of growth and and color. The book unfolded with unexpected, but not impossible, shots from left field. I am inclined to agree that there were a few loose ends left with the story, I would enjoy a sequel a great deal."
4,it was good,it was very good but somtimes hard to follow. i kind of got lost in the pages. but the story line and the characters were very good and i dont regret buying it. im 13 and i think it could be a book for all ages
3,Exciting yet confusing,"Laurell Hamilton created much excitment in her novel, Nightseer. She has much originality yet doesnt spend much time explaing the key aspects of the novel. There were some parts that while reading it and trying to understand it was thrilling but as i look back i wont remember any of it because they author didnt explain. The ending was also a little weak. A little more detail was needed in this book"
3,ok but only skims the surface,"this was laurell's very first novel... i could definitely tell it was her writing. the stubborn fighting woman who tries to save everyone and is magical.. it was ok but lacked the originality her other books have, well, that's what i thought at least."
4,Excellent,"All successful writers sooner or later learn that the story begins where the story begins. This particular book has a lot of pre-story, but the reviewers who feel that it needs a prequel are wrong. The author works in the background in such a way that the salient points are obvious, and while they might indeed have made an entertaining story on their own, such a story is by no means necessary to understand and appreciate this one. The only real problem here is that the action is repetitive, therefore tedious. Fewer fights (or shorter fights) and more characterization would have been appreciated. Nevertheless, I liked this story very much. It doesn't need a prequel, but it sure could use a sequel!"
4,Quite Good,"_Nightseer_ is an adventurous and sorcerous fantasy featuring Keleios, a young magic practitioner with interesting gifts. Her interaction with Lothor, a rather anti-heroic and frustratingly attractive character, is a somewhat light-hearted mix of romance and antagonism. The plot moves swiftly, with great supporting characters(of numerous different species)."
2,It's not Anita Blake,"If you hope to read a strong, precursor character of Anita Blake, this isn't the book to buy. It is a very imaginative tale, but an arid one. The reader does get into the characters' lives, psyches, etc., but the story is not as fresh, lively, or quirky as the Anita Blake or Meredith Gentry series."
5,Queen of Fantasy!,Laurel K. Hamilton is the reigning queen of fantasy writers. I have all her books. She's the BEST!
2,Where is the first book?,"Here was a book that was published because of Ms. Hamilton's success with the Vampire Hunter series.There are huge gaps in this book - which lead me to believe that there should have been a prior book. I gave it two stars (instead of one) because it does have potential, but I found the plot confusing and the characters too numerous.I hope she goes for a rewrite OR comes up with a ""prequel."""
1,A disappointment,"This is the kind of badly written run of the mill ""fantasy"" that has given such a bad name to the genre. I can hardly believe that it was written by the author of the magnificent Anita Blake series (Guilty Pleasures, The Laughting Corpse and following - highly recommended). It must be a very early, infantile effort. I trew it away after 40 pages."
2,Good if you like magical combat,I have read all of the Anita Blake series and Death of a Darklord and I was very disappointed in this novel.Laurell K Hamilton is usually much better at developing characters and producing interesting plots than this. Most of the characters seemed to have been used as plot devices to link the different battles.There were too many loose ends in this book which makes me wonder if it is the middle of a series.
2,Ok but something is lacking,I really enjoyed Hamilton's other books and I knew that this one was a change from her other stuff. It was allright except I felt like I was reading the second book of a series. People and events were mentioned as if the reader should be familiar with the fictional world that was created for this book. I managed to make it through but it was tough.
1,A horrible first book,"I am a HUGE fan of Laurell K. Hamilton, but this book is terrible. Characters are not well formed, the plot is weak and the world/magic system is poorly explained. This is an obvious first try, as if it were written when she was a teen and reprinted later to make money off of her popular name. For a better idea of what she can do as an author, check out the Merry Gentry books or see her at her best in the Anita Blake books. I had trouble getting into the book, but kept reading because she hasn't let me down yet. I was seriously disapointed."
2,Obviously a junior effort,"I was really disappointed with this novel, which was only slightly mollified by the fact that this was her first novel. There was no character development, no attempt to explicate the main character. In fact what I disliked in this book is the same failing I've seen in her books lately, bad pacing, all action, no reflection on the challenging moral choices the characters have to make. The early Anita Blake novels were certainly better than anything she has written lately."
2,very disappointing,"I was excited when I found this book...I'm a big fan of Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series. However, Nightseer seemed extremely unfocused and hard to read. I kept hoping as I read that it would get better, but it never did. Obviously Hamilton's writing has improved over the years."
1,not a good book,I picked up this book because I couldn't find the Anita Blake series but figured I'd get a taste of her writing.Big mistake. Now I'm rather afraid to pick up the Anita Blake series if this is the kind of writing I have to look forward to.There was little character development and almost no explanation for the reasons behind the events. At the end I had no attachment at all to the main character and had no idea why half of the events happened.Don't waste your time.
3,Magic,"This book once again shows L.Hamilton's skill with engaging the reader's imagination. I thought it read well, but would much rather see the author devote more time to the Anita Blake series. It's a good read, and if I hadn't read the A. Blake series first, would crave more of this. I will say, if another book follows this one, I will read it."
4,Ms Hamiton please begin at the begining!,"Nightseer is like a the star wars movies it begins in the middle. Don't git me rong I truely enjoyed the book. I love the character they just came to life for me. Keleios was a trip. BUT!! This should not be the first book in the series! That is if there is to be a series. It should have been the 2nd or 3rd book at the very least. It aggravates a person if they there is know pervious book to explan the one they are reading. It leave questions unanswered such as ... How was she, her mother and her sister caught and later rescued? How did the Witch escape death? How did she get the Demondmark and why such a powerful one? Why is Keleios rejected by her mother's people? Where is her father? Why were her parent never married? Where is her father's people? And most of all what is Oh So Special about Keleios that the Darkhealer elf prince would rather kill or be killed by her if he could not wed her??"
1,definitely first effort,"I was well into reading anita blake series and meredith series, so when this was released I thought bonus. Well disappointing is more the word. I truly do enjoy Ms Hamilton's work but this first was just that. Thankfully she greatly improved."
4,Hamilton does it again!,"As much as I love the Merry Gentry and Anita Blake series, I truly wish Ms. Hamilton would go back to her debut Novel ""NIGHTSEER"" and finish what she started. As noted by another reviewer a prequel would be nice, but a few sequels would be even better. There is so much left standing at the end of this novel that I keep watching for her to write a sequel. The abrupt ending makes you think there is already another book out there waiting to be picked up. As much as I enjoyed this book, I really don't believe I would have read it if I had realized ahead of time how unfinished it is. Hopefully Ms. Hamilton will remember and return to her beginnings."
4,Not your usual Laurell K.,"If you're looking for Anita Blake this isn't it, however, that said it is a good Fantasy read. There are a lot of plot points that remain unresolved which makes you wonder if there was a second book in the works at one time, but all in all it's a nice effort worth reading."
4,Are we getting a sequel?,This was the first book of Laurell Hamilton's that I read and I have to say that it is my favorite. The only gripe I have with it is that there isn't a sequel. I think that this book is on par with her Anita Blake series.
3,It's.. OK,"Honestly, I don't really recommend reading this book after reading Laurell K. Hamilton's other books. It's OK, like I said, but not as fun, engaging or well written as her Anita Blake series (which I adore and highly recommend). I found the writting to be choppy and disjointed; it just didn't flow well.For a first book, not bad... but you can definitely tell her writting style has changed and matured for the better with her later novels."
4,No problem w/ transaction or merchant! Y$4FAST(s+h)F=+CO2...FsloAOK?...ask Amazon!,"For my politic studies, this assigned first read was fast, informative, and captivating. If you do not receive passion for the San Francisco labor class after you read this you are obviously a Republican. This is a quick yet deep read if you think.ChangeItOrDrownItB 36 Ears"
4,Great Reference Book,"Being new to computers and at an age when my memory is a little dull-I like having this book on hand for the basic questions. I apparently thought I was ordering the leopard edition when I must have been looking at the tiger reviews. I was disappointed in that but it still has information that I needed and it is presented in a way that makes learning this computer stuff not so scary to me. It helped me loosen up and I like the way Robin Williams leads me through practice runs so that I'm not just reading about it. The shipping from the seller I used was very slow and I will not order from them again, but the book itself was in good shape and the price was good. Thanks Amazon!"
4,Little Mac Book a success,"I found the Little Mac Book very helpful with a lot of good, basic information to get the beginner off on the right foot. The information was clear, and the step-by-step directions were easy to follow. It was full of extra little ""tips"" to make things easier. A few times, I wish the author had offered more details, but I guess that's another book."
2,excellent for the mac novice,"this is one book Apple should include with new Macs for new users. enough to help you thru, but that's all the novice needs. But only if you can stomach Robin Williams' (not the comedian) cutesy blathering writing style that is her over-the-top personality. otherwise, she is considered one of the mac experts."
2,"This is not a ""little"" book!!","I was seeking a pocket reference for my new Mac and figured since this was called ""The Little Mac Book"" (and had lots of good reviews) that it would be perfect. I can't speak to the content of this book, but...here's a heads up: This is NOT A LITTLE BOOK and by no means will fit in your pocket. Of course I should've looked more closely since the book's dimensions ARE provided with the description here. Yet another reason to shop at the bookstore. Oh well...live and learn!"
4,little mac book...Leopard,"The LMB (little Mac Book) was just what I was looking for.... it reviewed some of the basics, and did not assume that I knew more than I really did...glad I got it; wish I would have gotten the LMB for Tiger two years ago... I'd get the next LMB for the next new OS, whenever it makes it's appearance.... it does not assume you're a complete dummy; and was a little too basic in some areas, but great in others... And I love the discounted price...."
5,Thanks Robin,I have bought & will by any book by Robin Williams: so informative & delightful is she! The most complex engineering/task is rendered doable in her capable hands.
5,I have found it to be more than just informative!,"Being new to computers and to the internet, this book has on more than one occasion saved my bacon. I live in a small community with only 1 person with any appreciable knowledge of Macintosh systems, and when I have run into problems late in the evening, I have been able to study her book, and have been able to sort things out. Without this book, I don't think I would be able to enjoy this iMac as much as I do. Thank you Robin Williams!"
4,The Little Mac Book a bit Too Little,"Overall a very informative book. I learned some new things for sure. I was hoping for a bit more info on the i Life programs but I guess that is a separate ""little book"". All in all it was pretty good. Good clear explanations in plain words. The diagrams where quite good. The free web version was not accessible with out a membership I think, which of course costs money! That's it. Darrell Sandmoen"
5,Great for new mac users,"I bought this book after looking at several at the local book stores and asking my teacher at the Mac ""genius bar"" what he recommended. It is making my pc to mac transition totally painless using simple instructions and great illustrations. I would definitely buy more of Robin Williams' books after I master the basics."
3,Concealer Not Foundation,"I don't know if I was confused or what, but I thought this was foundation in a stick. It is a concealer. Really heavy. It covers pretty well, and the color's great, but it doesn't last very long. (I'm a bit oily) It might work for others, but wasn't great for me."
5,the best,"This is the best foundation I have ever used. I loathe the day Benefit will discontinue it.Manages to cover spots, pimples, without ever looking cakey or dry.Elegant texture, incredible staying power."
4,Jump Rope concealer,I like the consistency. Conceals very well but does not feel heavy.I've been using this for almost 2 years!!!
1,Do Not Waste Your Time,This is nothing but poorly written drivel. A friend in publishing gave it to me. I am so glad I didn't pay for it. Amateur writing coupled with a huge ego. Bleah.
1,Aims high. Falls flat.,"This author is obviously enamored with Hemingwayesque prose, but unfortunately it comes off in a sophomoric and self-absorbed way. I wish that he had more to say about the war and less to say about himself."
4,A Unique Perspective on a Mismanaged War,"Due to the DOD's brilliant policy of ""embedding"" reporters, there have been very few books written by reporters discussing there view of the war in Iraq. (Where are you David Halberstam?)I was glad to see that Mr. Feuer was brave enough to write about his experience covering the war. Mr. Feuer's book is a classic fish out of water story. He writes an amusing, sarcastic and insightful book about his experience. His book does a great job capturing ""T.R's"" feelings as he unexpectedly finds himself in the action in Jordan and Iraq. If you are looking for a book that discusses the failures of journalists to adequately cover the war, this isn't the book for you. If you are looking for a great story about one man's journey into a confusing and awful situation, then buy this book."
3,I feel like I missed the punch line.,"This book was an easy read, in fact I read it in an afternoon. It was interesting enough; I kept turning the pages to see what would happen to our dear socialite. She's believable, we feel empathy for her but we never quite understand her. What this book lacks is resolution. I just read 200+ pages and Caroline has still taken secrets to her grave. There are still unanswered questions about the portrait. Maybe it is the author's right to leave a mystery unsolved but it violates the rules of ""good"" writing not to restore readers to a point of equilibrium and the author never takes us there. In the end, an interesting read but seemingly unfinished."
4,"Not as good as Execution Ground, but I'd still buy it!","Great album that will grow on you overtime. Not for the faint hearted though... If you're not into Naked City's ""Torture Garden"" this may not be the CD for you... Quite different from the other Pain Killer ""Execution Ground."" I enjoy it - although I don't listen to it all that often..."
3,Ear-bleeding deathmetal jazz,"Trio consisting of postmodern saxophonist John Zorn, ambient/bass master Bill Laswell, and the drummer of Napalm Death (forgot his name, oops), this is improvisational death metal. Its often as ferocious as music can get as their improvisations seem to build more force than you would get from a pre-written song. Still, its too much to listen to for more than 3 or 4 songs"
5,...smooth jazz anyone?,...this is by far one of the most incriminating things ever done to a saxophone...although simple high pitched dissonance John Zorn does the job very well...and the first time I heard it I just thought it was a computer who altered someone's screaming voice......very simply this music is dark and improvised...the bass creates an atmospheic drone while the drums create the pace...and the saxophone creates the chaos above it...in one of the records there is some singing/screaming...but most of it is instrumental......guts of a virgin is my favourite out of the two mainly because it's the first one I heard...via finetune...but listen to this and I can honestly say you haven't heard something so dark and heavy with a saxophone (and if you have don't rub it in my face)...but yes...I'd recommend it to all with an eclectic taste...
3,Hit the Nail on the Head with this one,"By the title I mean the other reviews described it well. But I would also like to recommend other artist out of the Zorn genre. If you like this try also The Iceburn Collective - Meditavolutions. Not as heavy a bass line in that album but, just as good. Bill Laswell is just awesome to be able to from the ambient style of bass to this wild, full of effects, hardcore bass playing. John Zorn's sax sounds as though it is a DJ scratching. Then the album just turns in to the ultimate jam album. Very experimental and recommend this album for anyone looking for something different."
1,Not very good at all...,"The ""microscope"" never worked at all. It is cheap plastic and very badly made. You get a few small pieces of indicator paper and a few bags of baking soda, citric acid and gelatin plus one prepared slide you will not be able to view with the ""microsope"".Very disappointing. The Discovery Channel kits are better value. Don't waste your money on this kit."
1,stinks,"It's just terrible. The microscope doesn't work, the baking soda spills everywhere, and I regret my waste of money. NEVER GET THIS!"
2,It fell out...,"When I got it, it seemed to fit well in the bumper of my trailer. But driving down the road I noticed something dangling out of the bumper, ""It was the sewer hose!"" Of course it was embarrassing to stop and shove the hose back in, thank goodness I had my trusty duct tape to tame the snaky beast. The bumper cap was long gone never to be seen by my eyes again. I'm still looking for the perfect bumper cap that will not pop out just because the road is a little bumpy. The quest goes on..."
3,There is only 1 in this purchase.,"The picture is deceptive -- the purchase is for ONE cap -- not two! I was hoping to get two for a back up in case I lose another one.... oh well, at least it works."
2,I was jealous and distracted!,"I could relate to Buchman's experience as a mother, as a mother of a disabled child. I think all of us have gone through similar emotions and struggles. What was distracting for me - and perhaps I missed the point of the book because of it - was how easy it is for wealthy people like Dana Buchman to get prompt and expert help for their children. In fact I am resentful of the fact that I can't afford THE BEST therapy treatments for my daughter at this time, and we have no nanny, specialists, or private schools TO CHOOSE. So you see it is not really a choice at all. While learning disorders and disabilities can effect ALL children, SOME parents and children have MORE OPTIONS to deal with it. The rest of us have that much more suffering to go through."
1,Reviewer Lisa M. Fischler doesn't know what she's talking about.,"There is a much better book out there called Laughing Allegra by Anne Ford who is another wealthy author. Anne Ford's book is more honest and goes deeply into the subject. Dana Buchman's book is superficial. You only get the surface. LD covers a wide range of disabilities including mental retardation. Mental retardation means that the person is not meeting the expectations that their peers are at, and according to the state that I live in, that is considered mental retardation."
4,Great book to learn from,"I also have a child with LD and was thrilled when I saw this book. Buying this book, I thought that it would just be an interesting read to help and feel more connected to others in similar situations. As I started to read it, it has become almost addictive reading. The read is so easy and clean that I will just pick it up for 5 to 10 minutes when I have a chance. I also don't want to put it down when I have to do something else. It is definitely a must read for other parents of LD children and a great suggestion for teachers."
1,"What is a ""learning difference""?","Book left me more confused and with a lot more questions. Like what is a ""learning difference""? Never heard of it."
4,Not to everyone's taste,I bought these just to give them a go. They are very rigid even compared to my dunlop stubby 3.0's. The edges seem a bit sharper than they should be and shred up your strings pretty quick. They give a bright metallic tone with very aggressive attack. If that's what your after then try these out. I personally prefer the feel and tone of the Dava master control.
5,Hard and sharp,"I've use copper and brass picks for over 30 years. Before that I had favoured turtle shell. But these are super long wearing, have a slight contour and perforations for improved grip. For precision, speed, sharpness these picks are hard to beat. Relatively not cheap, but a single pick will last years. They may not be for everyone, but if you're feeling like you're missing something in the picks you're using, I suggest you try these.."
2,the gift that never came,"lousy communication. the gift was not sent in time for Christmas tho it was purchased in plenty of time. only yesterday (12/29) did we receive confirmation that our purchase price was refunded and credited back to our account.Not Hppay.Not impressed with the seller or Amazon. Nothing but an ""we didn't forget you"" and ""we are so sorry"". Doesn't quite do it when your child is expecting a Christmas gift.Probably will attempt to avoid future episodes by seeking to buy elsewhere"
4,Enjoyed product,This product turned out to be good gear for me an my team we look forward to buying more in the future.
4,It even fit AK magazines.,"Not too shabby. It's comfortable, easy to adjust, fits AR magazines good, my glock 22 fits the holster as if it were made for it, and it even fits my AK magazines. Also as an added bonus it shipped real fast."
3,firepower deluxe tactical vest,"the vest shipped pretty fast. it was a little big out of the box but thats normal. it has many different ways to adjust it, Shoulder straps and back straps that adjust to your size. it has alot of pockets and pouches to put amo, cell phone gun mags. the only downfall to the vest is that it also comes with a side holster that velcros to the vest but was not strong enought to hold my 40 cal. bereta. no biggy I just used a needle and some real strong thread and and a little help from a hot glue gun and made it strong enough other than that the vest is a real good buy."
4,Not a bad vest,"For the price this vest is a great deal. It's pretty lightweight and not very cumbersome. Although not the most comfortable thing in the world, it does the job. Great if you like running and gunning or do tactical paintball/airsoft, etc. Comes with spare pistol mag pouches for the belt and has plenty of room to carry a lot of ammo. A good buy. I recommend it."
5,A Message Louder Than That,"Caleb Quaye has been a Guitar god for most of rock n roll since the first few bars of ""There Goes A Well Known Gun"" on the Elton John ""Tumbleweed Connection"" recording from the early seventies. In ""A Voice Louder Than Rock n Roll"" he uses his background and upbringing, along with his teenage friendship with Reg Dwight as a backdrop to his much needed and exciting conversion to a new way of life. In spite of the lights, cameras and action of drug abuse, the arena show lifestyle and his quest for fame, Caleb found true meaning for his life in the salvation of Jesus Christ. It was a joy to read, as I could hardly put it down. The rare photos and history of all things Elton coupled with the perfect ending made for a most enjoyable read."
4,I like the quick release plate.,I liked the large handles makes easy to use with gloves on. The quick release mount is a good idea. This comes in handly when lugging the tripod around without having the camera attached. It takes some getting use to the saftey latch. I wish there was markiig or detent were 90 and 180 was. Or maybe a bubble level.
1,Feelings Journal,"This was bought for a 10-year-old girl because she is showing signs of menarche; however, after previewing it there are parts about sexuality that are too explicit for this age group. The book states pre-teens and teens. I disagree that it is age appropriate for pre-teens. It is more appropriate for teens and older ones at that."
2,Fell Short,The story was interesting enough. Strong black sister with Mr. Wrong learns to love herself and then meets Mr. Right. My issue was that the story wasn't written in a coherent manner. Writing can make or break a good story. This just didn't do it for me.
2,Fell Short,"This novel fell short in the Christian Fiction Category. My first disappointment was in the profanity that was used in the book, granted most of it was bleeped out and used by people who were not of faith, but i read christian fiction to avoid even the thought of it. The Novel otherwise mediocre."
4,good read,"It was slow to start for me, or should I say slow to keep my attention. But when it picked up the pace, it was a good read."
3,"An entertaining read, but....","I found myself at times having to remind myself that this was Christian fiction. This story is about a shallow, over-materialistic young lady named Chantell who masterfully balances on a thin line that divides Christians from non-Christians. She does a lot of things that aren't widely named among those who claim Christianity, but even so, she is a believable character. I concluded that this book was meant to highlight the growth process of Christianity, but that message got lost many times in the ""games"" that Chantell played. Overall, it was a good read and well-written despite my personal issues with the storyline itself. I really wanted to give it 3.5 stars, but since that wasn't an option, I felt that it leaned more toward the 3 than the 4."
3,Blunted smoothness,Worthwhile debut to the inventive organic trip-hop group offers plenty of exotic up-tempo groove but remains overly noisy and lacking in melody compared to later efforts.
4,Great so far.,"Easy to use and seems to be doing great, I will know more after the winter it has been keeping the garage at 60 while it is in the 30's outside and only runs for a few minutes per hour. The test will come when it is below zero and there is a wind. I may need a second one."
3,"Don't let the picture trick you, this is a small charm!","This charm is much smaller than it looks online. Compared to the other charms on my bracelet, this one is really little. I guess it makes sense, considering how much cheaper it is than most charms. It is cute and of good quality, but definitely tiny!"
4,Good textbook,This is a pretty good textbook that covers the basics of corporate management from a strategic viewpoint. The language is clear and understandable if not concise.
4,How Win the War?,"The competition among companies in the same industry is like a war? How your going to win this war? This book will teach you that how top managers should do Internal and External Analysis, and how to implement them. As your company design new strategy, your employess should put those strategies in action and also as you move you must evaluate your strategy and vary to situation you must change it. Also you will learn how to apply porters five forces model to your company. In conclusion, I will review this text book as an outstanding book and I recomend it to anyone who is interested to learn about strategic management.Regards,Alireza Bialayesh"
3,A little more beat up than I thought,"While I realize I purchased a used book, I thought the condition would be a little better than what it is. The edges of the spine of the book are pretty worn and missing color; there's a sticker on the back and if you peel up the corner, I noticed that the cover is ripped underneath it. Overall, it will work but I'm not impressed."
1,strategic Management in action 5th edition,There is no reason why this book should be this expensive I could have taken this class with the 4th edition. It sucks that publishing companies force students who don't have much money to buy expensive books.
5,Always alert!,"The mind of the businessman should be very similar to hunter 's attitude. Never satisfied and always searching new challenges, the successful by itself is never a goal, but only a simple step in the process.Interesting testimonial book around the experiences in the gradually most exigent and complex activity: the management in the actual times."
5,Damm good book.,"I you go to Rio, and don't have any one there to show you around, then don't leave without this book. Actually even if you have someone there, take the book. You will enjoy Rio a lot more that way. The author also has a great web page with basically the content of the book and daily updates of what to do. Unfortunately (not for me), is not in English (Spanish, German, French, Italian, and Portuguese). Buy a month or so before you go, and read it and select the places you want to go. There is so much to do in Rio."
4,Rio in a nutshell,"We had actually planed to make Rio a stopover. The three of us ended up staying for eight days. Before we left Norway most of my friends urged us to move on to other places, since Rio really wasn't that accessable. This is where Rio for Partiers changed our flight plans. In a jungle of things to see, one is usually lost cuase all the trees are blocking the way. The book was the key to an exciting stay. We had a very hungry person with us on the trip -the book met all his demands, and more. Unlike lonely planet, this was more like the executive summary with pictures. Definately easy reading. The book literally came in handy as our fix-it now tool for tourists. Worth while the buy."
2,Overrated but has some helpful facts,"I approached this book (newest edition) with much excitement. A book that tells you where to party every night of the week!? Sounds amazing.On two separate nights (Sunday + Monday) it failed. The club it suggests on Sunday night in Ipanema was having a 16 year olds birthday (no thanks) and the club on Monday was not even open anymore. This for a book that was copyrighted less than a year ago? I would take a lot of the suggestions in the book with a grain of salt. Instead meet local young Brazilians or check some updated websites for where to go out partying. Ditto for the Salvador version, which encourages you to hit the Pelorino at night. Way to dodgy and shady for any tourist, just happy we made it out of there alive.Some of the ideas the book provides during the day aren't bad. You could find this information anywhere else though. Don't mistake this book as the holy bible for Rio Nightlife, it is out of date and overhyped."
5,Best Travel Guide!,"I went to Rio last year with a friend. She brought two travel guides, and I brought two travel guides. We quickly ditched all the other travel guides, but carried Rio for Partiers around every day we were in Rio.This book tells you about things only locals know and other travel guides don't teach you. It explains (with pictures) food you will find on the beach and in the street cafes, complete with an estimated cost. The book also explains hand signals commonly used in Rio (very helpful), includes popular phrases, a map, tells you what to pack, what to wear, where to eat, were to go on day trips, and so much more.The friends we stayed with (Americans) had been living in Rio for several months and said the advice was dead on. They also learned a thing or two from the book. You don't have to be young, or a partier to love this book. If you're going to Rio, you need this book!"
5,Excellent travel guide for Rio,"I just had to write in to say that this book was a God-send. One doesn't associate Rio with dull - but if it hadn't've been for this book, I wouldn't have had such a brilliant time. Absolutely amazing. I suggest anyone heading that way gets a copy."
4,Brilliant,"I'll start with some words I never thought I'd type. This book is worth getting for the preface alone. Come on, admit it. Some of us don't even read prefaces. But this one's brilliant.And the book itself? Eight shorter works of fiction from one of China's finest contemporary authors. Loads of praise on the cover, all true, but I'll just grab the words ""satire, fantasy, the supernatural, mystery: all are present in this remarkable, and intensely enjoyable, volume."" I'll also add insightful, witty, clever, moving, and playful. I've reviewed his writing before, as well as other translations by Howard Goldblatt. The marriage of talents is perfect here. It's an extremely easy read, and one I'm certain you'll enjoy."
5,BOOK,A FRIEND OF MINE LOVES READING BOOKS AND THIS WAS ONE OF A KIND ! =). SHE IS STUDYING ENGLISH AND THIS BOOK WILL HELP HER FOR SURE TO IMPROVE HER READING AND UNDERSTANDING OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR.MY FRIEND IS REALLY HAPPY ABOUT THESE PURCHASE.A+++
3,Mo Yan,"I am very interested in the Chinese culture, so I wanted to read this recently honored writer. I selected this and Garlic Ballads as my first reads. I am still absorbing this culture, it is not easy..."
5,Makes coding easy,"The technique described in this book is great. I used it to design a java applet recently and I found it reduced coding to a trivial task. The power of the technique lies in specifying the ""syntax of interaction"" before the user interface is coded.I strongly recommend this book."
4,Confusing,"I bought this thinking it was a new Preston/Child book. Turns out it is a German version of ""Reliquary,"" translated back into English. It is not verbatim from the English version so I have no idea why anyone would buy this instead of just buying ""Reliquary."" Some of the translations are not entirely accurate either."
1,Attic,I ordered this book but did not realize that it was in the language German. So needless to say I had to return it. I was hoping to try to find a copy that is in English.
4,Great product,My hairdresser uses this and I love it. I normally am not one to buy the products the salon uses due to the expense however this one is worth it. It provides just a little hold to set my style and provides GREAT shine. I also like the scent.
5,Souffle Dish,"These are larger than my other set and work wonderfully for soup, etc. Much needed and will be used constantly in my kitchen. And, they look nice enough to use for company!!"
5,Work well,They work great for one serving pot pies and cherry cobblers. More than enough capacity for a meal and if you use them for dessert you might have to share the portion with another. These hold a lot.Seem to be heavy duty -- haven't chipped after a couple months.
4,nice containers,"The little dishes are just as described and nicely made and enjoyed.The recipe I used, not so much.I will keep searching for that perfect macaroni and cheese recipe, but I have found the dishes!"
5,Exacly as expected,Satisfied with the purchase of this set of dishes. We use them in meal prep and they are perfectly sized.
3,One broken dish,"I ordered two sets of the HIC Porcelains 10-Ounce souffle dishes which totaled 12 units. Unfortunately the packing was not good so one of them broke. The return policy requires me to return the entire order which to me may cause more trouble than its worth since I have 11 good ones out of 12. Who knows, the replacement order might have the same problem or even more broken dishes."
3,Very Poor packing,"Two sets of remekins were ordered and sent as a gift. Unfortunately, the packing was sorely inadequate - huge box with the air packs on the TOP but ramekins resting unpadded on the bottom of the box. When our gift was opened 2 broken ramekins were found.It is a huge disappointment that Amazon has not followed up on the of the previous reports of breakage. I would NOT recommend buying this Amazon item."
2,"Cute, as always, but not great.","I agree with another reviewer who said it teaches incorrect phonics! Also, they made odd choices for some of the letters. For example, for ""I"" they say 'insect' - but of course my toddler says ""I"" is for bug! Which I have to then correct every time. They could easily have used ""igloo"" from one of the Maisy episodes, where Maisy and Charlie play inside one. But the worst is the letter X. They say ""X"" is in 'excited' and 'excuse me'!!! Ridiculous! Especially since they immediately show Maisy and all her friends playing instruments - and Eddie is playing a XYLOPHONE! Duh! The only reason I gave this video 2 stars instead of 1, is that my daughter loves it. I do not - there are better videos to teach the alphabet and phonics."
1,Not very good service - poorly packaged,I had to return this tape because it was damaged when received - to date I have NOT received the replacement. Tape was send back and received by the seller 10 days ago.
3,Physical Science,This is a interesting book. I am currently enrolled in this class. I am not doing so well in it. It is sort of complicated because the teacher teaches from another book. I would like the instructors to recieve some guidelines according to how the lessons are to be reviewed and the tests should be given from the book instead of tests from other universities with different books and notes.
1,Beware. I should have listened.,"I bought this in 2009 and used it about 3 different times for my cars. The 4th time, it started smoking and smell burned plastic. I followed the instructions by taking the compressor to rest after a number of minutes. The 5th time I tried to use it on my bicycles, it just didn't run anymore. It's burned.Don't buy this item. It is not worth it. Mean life is very very short. You'll be lucky if you will be able to use it for over 5 times."
1,failure after three uses,"THIS COMPRESSOR/INFLATOR DID NOT LIVE TO EXPECTATIONS.ONLY THREE TIMES I OPERATED THE GADGET. ON THE LAST ONE, SOMETHING INSIDE THE MACHINE BURNED, AND THE OPERATING SWITCH DID NOT RESPOND ANYMORE. THE BON-AIRE BA121L, 120V WAS MADE IN CHINA, SO YOU KNOW."
4,God so far,"Only have used it a few times but seems well made anddoes the job.Looks good, isnt overly loud."
1,Not recommended,"I used this product 4-5 times. It broke into a number of parts. Customer service won't return an email. All I ask is something to be reliable, either the produt or the service department."
1,DO NOT BUY! BROKE AFTER A YEAR OF LITTLE USAGE,"After sparse usasge, (a couple minutes every few months), the machine started to die. Eventually, a burning smell would present itself after turning it on and it would die on it's own after a minute."
2,Short life,"Under occasional use, it lasted about one year before failing. Used it for bike and auto tires. I""ve resorted to a hand pump."
2,Dead Aire,"The Bon-Aire BA121L was purchased about 2 years ago and used on average about once every few months to air up 10-15 tires. It worked fine until a month ago when it started laboring and had a electrical smell- basically dead. So, for $35-$40 it was very disappointing. I won't buy another inflator from this company. I expect an appliance like this to last more than 2 years."
5,air compressor,everything as advertised. Works well and stores wellWe be exceptionally easy to use and best of all this will be easy to store and cord wraps around compressor
2,WORKS A FEW TIMES AND THEN BREAKS!,My husband bought this a few years ago. We've added air to a few tires and maybe inflated a float or two. Longevity and reliability are not with this model!
1,Short life span,"I have owned this unit for a bit less than 3 years. I have only used it to maintain tire pressure in car tires so it does not get heavy use. I have only used it about 6 times each year. It did fine when it was new and I was very happy. However, I tried to use it yesterday on a car tire and noticed that the pressure guage did not show anything and the tire was not being inflated. I felt along the hose and could feel air leaking out the side. A closer look showed that there multiple cracks in numerous places along the hose and air leaks out. The hose is press fit onto the unit so there is no replacing it. A rubber hose failing by deterioration in less than 3 years reflects the poor quality parts used on the compressor. Look elsewhere for a 120V compressor."
2,Busted Way Too Early,"Like others have said. Would be a great little compressor if it actually didn't have quality problems and break. How hard is it to make a compressor that will fill up a couple of car and bike tires, max once a month, and work for 5 years? This one busted after 18 months. That honks me off (pun intended). :-)"
1,Just righ while it lasted...but expected way more than 18 months,"No problems and worked just as required to inflate bicycle and car tires occasionally, then one day just stopped working. Probably only used it 5 times over 18 months before failure."
1,Burned out on me quick,Only had it a month. BLew up some pool toys and she just stopped working. Off to the garbage with this one.
3,Average Item,"This is a low quality item. The unit arrived perfectly but was defective. I plugged it in, connected the unit and the air hose leaked air where it connects to the main pump. The unit quickly heated up and barely kept up with it's pin hole leak. The pressure gauges bounces like crazy and the unit is very loud. I did further research and found that these little units are imports sold under various names. I called the manufacturer for parts and they promptly responded that they stock no parts as these are throw away items. My old inflator was a Sears Craftsman that last 15 years and had part availabilty. I promptly returned this unit for refund. Run from this unit and it's look alikes. They are not worth money."
2,Not built to last,This product worked fine for most of the first year then completely died exactly one year after purchase....as soon as it was out of the warranty period. Not worth the money.
2,Great product... WHILE it lasted.,"Bought this product on September 2011 and as of date(Dec. 22, 2012) it has broken down. It was great while it lasted. I never, exceeded the 10minute period that they stated, it usually takes me 1 minute or less to top off a tire. It does the job quickly, while it worked. However, today I tried to top off my tires and it died on me. If you want to spend 60 dollars, try to find something better and will last longer."
1,...and poof it was gone,I used this pump for inflating bicycle tires and it works fine for that. The first time I used it on my truck tires it managed to fill one tire to 60psi but when starting the second tire a poof of smoke came out of the unit and it was fried. It should at least have an auto shut off if it's that fragile.
2,Good performance but short life,"I used this once or twice each month to top off two cars' tires--pretty light use. Worked great for the first 18 months, but the pump started overheating after one and a half years and burned out completely just after two years. I wouldn't buy this model again."
1,Very bad quality,"I got this unit about a year ago, and used it several times until it produced terrible smell and broke. This is my second air compressor that I bought, chinese made. I am so dissapointed that the industry cannot produce a decent air compressor."
1,Junk,"Sears badge-labels this thing and sells it as a Craftsman product. Webought one, fired it up to inflate a low tire on a van, and within3 minutes the unit was smoking. Yes, you read that right, smoking,as in burning out its motor. Sears took it back without comment."
2,Not very sturdy,"We have only used this twice and the second time was for a child's outside pool and after it was blown up there were screws that had come loose I guess due to the vibration and we have no way of getting them back into place. So, after using it twice it is falling apart."
4,Good tire inflator,"I have used this product for about 3 months now as a tire inflator for my car (about 1-2 tire inflations peer week), and so far it has performed as expected. It inflates at a reasonable rate but it is, of course, not as fast as the big compressors at gas stations. It takes about 30 seconds to increase the pressure from 20 to 30 PSI, and I have had no problems getting a tight valve fit during inflation. As all comparable compressors it does produce noise and vibrations but not excessively so."
1,Failure,"This is a horrible product. I should have known better when I read other reviews. I bought this item after my car had a flat tire while parked in the 3rd level below ground of my building's parking garage. I thought I was being smart by having my own source to inflate a tire if it happened again. Well it happened this morning 9/26/12. I was confident I had a solution on hand. However, I plugged the device into a socket and hit the power button only to be greeted with a short whirring noise and then zap. Nothing. Completely useless. Terrible quality control and this manufacturer deserves all the bad reviews I read. Maybe mine will keep you from making the same mistake. In the meantime, I'm waiting for my insurance company's road side assistance to come deal with my tire so I can get to work. I gave this company $60 that I'll never get back, but they will never get any more of my money."
1,disappointing,"I received this for Christmas 2009 and didn't use it till March of 2010.After approx. 1 month, the machine screws worked loose from the head and the compressor wouldn't perform. I fixed it myself.3 months later, the unit ceased working - this time it was because the motor had picked up foreign material and it was shorting out the brushes - what others have reported as smoke and a smell of electrical fire. If jostled, the unit might work, but at a lower speed and output.I've given up on it.It's poorly engineered for my needs, which were pretty light duty - mostly topping off lawn tractor tires.A hand pump is a better investment than this."
2,GREAT WHILE IT LASTED,"I very much enjoyed this product for about 2 1/2 years, and then the compressor died. Not built to last."
1,Warning-don't buy!,"This air compressor inflator failed after only a few uses. I did own it for just under 2 years and only topped up the pressure of my car tires a couple of times per year. I'm very disappointed and out a little over 50 dollars. Sears craftsman uses this company to manufacture a similar model, identical in all aspects to this with exception to color. Steer clear of both!!!"
1,low quality product -- avoid!,"After _very_ very light use since 2008, it broke in 2010 -- the bolts that keep motor parts together loosened up and the motor parts fell apart! After looking inside I can see that the quality of assembly is very very low. I'm glad they saved a buck on tightening parts properly, but now I'm out of $60 plus time wasted."
1,Broke after 10 tires,"I would urge you not to purchase this product. My wife gave it to me in May for our anniversary and since then I may have used it 4 times to inflate tires. This past weekend it fell apart, started clattering etc. Now they say that I passed the return window 30 days? What a waste of money......... I think Amazon needs to re-look at this vendor for their lack of quality and return policy."
1,Junk!,"At first I liked this little unit, and it worked well during it's short life. However, it did not last long. I only used it to blow up some bicycle tires and to add a few pounds here and there to our vehicle tires. I may have used it a total of six times before the whole thing let go. Save your money and invest a few extra dollars into a real compressor. Also.. This is not a good unit for those who live in cold weather climates. I found that you can't remove the valve from the tire stem when it is really cold out. By the time you do, you will lose 5-10 lbs of air pressure from the tire. This unit is totally useless."
4,Fast Air Compressor/Inflator but really loud,"My Bon-Aire BA121L Air compressor/inflator arrived with a fairly large crack in the front but that hasn't hinder the function of this great product. What's great about this product is that it inflated my car's tires in a couple of minutes and it plug right into the wall outlet (althought the power cord is short so I had to connect it to an extension but it was no problem). Also came with different adapters for inflating sport's balls and other things. There is no car's cigarette plug so you won't have to worry about the amp rating and blown fuse. The only minor donwside is that when in operation, the Bon-Aire vibrate and sounded like a loud jackhammer but that what you have to pay for a fast and powerful inflator/compressor."
5,ONE YEAR and still going strong,"My husband said, ""What do you need THAT for?"" when this showed up from Amazon. Of course, I had to tell him that my front tire keeps getting low and I'm tired of stopping at a service station to get air.So, that was one year ago. Since then, I've seen HIM pull this out for other things at least once or twice a month. He's used it on a wheelbarrow wheel, pool floats, bicycle tires, you name it. For something that we did not need (according to him,) we (he) sure is getting a lot of use out of it!"
1,worked fine for one year and two months then zip,The product worked fine for us for one year and two months. Yesterday while filling our bicycle tires it began wheezing and wouldn't pump any more air. I'd say we got four or five good uses out of this before it went kablooey. We are a mere 20 days beyond Amazon's return window. Beware if you decide to pick this one.
1,Bicycle pump,"This pump is adequate as a bicycle pump but it has neither the air volume or power to inflate automobile, truck or trailer tires. Continuous operation for more than about 5 minutes at pressures above about 30 psi will cause the pump to fail. It has no replaceable parts."
2,Bon Aire tire inflator,"While certainly more powerful than my DC Bon Aire inflator this AC version would have to work pretty hard to fill a tire to 28 lbs in 2 minutes as advertised. I have to wait nearly a minute for it to add just 3 lbs. The air pressure gauge reads a constant 22 lbs. basically non functional. I would not buy another one, nor recommend it."
1,Piece of junk,"Sears sold this unit as Craftsman Model 9 15046. I received it as a Christmas present about 5 years ago. I put it in the back of the closet unopened and forgot about it. I discovered it today and took it outside to top off the tires on a car that I hadn't driven in a while. The first tire showed about 20 psi. It inflated to 35 psi in about a minute. Everything was great. The compressor barely even heated up. I moved on to the second tire, hooked it up, and hit the On/Off switch. Nothing, absolutely nothing. The piece of junk inflated exactly ONE tire before it quit!"
3,Good Air Compressor. Works well. Kind of Loud.,"There do not seem to be too many air compressors that receive good reviews. I gave this one 3 out of 5 for the following reasons.1. It does inflate bike tires, beach balls, and nearly every other smaller item I have tried.2. It is fairly loud. It also vibrates a lot which causes it to move around, so be careful not to set it on something where it may fall off.3. There are many attachments for all types of inflation needs. However many of them are not straightforward for how to attach them.4. There is a storage compartment for all the connectors, but it is difficult to open and close.I think this is a good air compressor, but I would have liked a quieter, easier, and less expensive option."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS. Same manufacturer as Sears which is junk,"It may look prettier in yellow but I immediately recognized this as the same one sold by Sears (black) which is junk. In short, it dies within a year. You can hear it dying and smell it as it burns out in front of you.Check out the Campbell Hausfeld unit sold here on Amazon for $20 less. Better built and quality vs the Bon-Aire as soon as you set them side by side, which I obviously can do with my dead Bon-Aire (Sears).The Campbell Hausfeld inflates faster and quiter. Less vibration and heat. And less money. Also better hose and hose storage. The Campbell Hausfeld is fuse protected....the Bon-Aire is not.You may want to add the Accu-Gauge EZ pressure gauge which has an excellent connector and gives you accurate pressure readings both of which any and all of these compressors lack.In short DO NOT BUY this Bon-Aire product. Check out the Campbell Hausfeld here on Amazon....better built, longevity and less money."
1,Not Good,"I've gotten 2 of these. Both were leaking oil. 1 had a bolt that had either came loose or was never put in at all. I won't get another.The only good thing was Amazon's service, no problem with that."
2,Stopped working after less than 1 hour total time,"This unit started out pretty good, although it was very tough to clamp on and off a car tire valve, losing a good amount of air each time. I used it about 8 times, and this last time it shut itself down after about 6 minutes of continuous use. It's now dead. I'll be purchasing a 'real' air compressor next."
4,good value,product works well. Definitely better from AC outlet than plugging into lighter. Fills fast. Only problem is it's difficult to remove from source so lose lots of air. Must overfill to compensate for lost air. Therefore you don't know an accurate amount of air that actually stays in the tires.Easy to use. Needs a quick release.
4,bon-aire,"Performance in inflating is very good for a portable. My only complaints are in recoiling the AC cord back in it's ""holder"", which is close to impossible and it's length is too short."
4,Does the Job,"This does the job. There are some reviews that talk about noise, but really, it's a compressor folks! It does the job and is powerful enough to make it quick and easy. The power cord could be longer, but that's the only thing that keeps it from 5 stars."
4,Great little compressor,"This is a great little compressor for the homeowner to keep in the garage. Great for blowing up pool toys, bike tires, etc...The only drawback I found is that it pulls too many amps to use when plugged into my factory AC outlet in my Dodge Durango."
4,air compressor,Works well- good price value relationship. Does not not have a Schrader valve attachment to fill one type of bike tires. Would purchase again.
5,Still Working Strong,"I've had this Compressor/Inflator for about 8 years now, I has never let me down, I use it to pump up my car tires, bicycle tires, and pool toys. I have a road bicycle and this thing easily pumps up the tires to 100psi with no problems at all. If it ever fails I will definitely get the same pump! Thanks Bon-Aire!"
1,stopped working after 3.5 months,It stopped working after 3.5 months under light use. You should stay away!!! No power at all. it is kinda too big too.
2,"Cheaply made attachments, motor burned out","We bought this a year and a half or so ago and followed all the directions on the (not very frequent) occasions we used it, but the motor burned out in the middle of inflating a tire a few weeks ago. Some of the attachment pieces were very flimsy and broke too. I wouldn't buy it again."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Have had this for 3 years, maybe used it a few times each year until it stopped working. I always kept it in it's box, only used it for small jobs; adding air to car and bicycle tires occasionally. It should have lasted longer."
2,Good for awhile; broke too soon,I bought this a few years ago. It did just what I needed. I like the packaging and attachments. But then it broke after just a few years. (And I did not use it all that often - maybe once every 3-4 months.) I'm looking for a different brand to replace.
2,Works great at first but doesn't last!,"I bought my second Bon-Aire compressor after my first one failed following a few years of infrequent use (mayby once a month or so adjust the tire pressure on my 2 cars). The units work great at first, but my second one failed after 6 months. I won't waste my money buying another one. Next time I'll buy are really compressor."
1,Burned out after a years use,"I only used this once a week to keep my mountain bike tires inflated. It works well for awhile then it starts to make a loud rattling noise, and takes a long time to work. The gauge is a joke, it is 10 psi (pounds per square inch) off. After 6 months it will operate at 50% power then one day it will just die & nothing but a lump of plastic & metal. I took it apart thinking i could repair it but not really worth it, if the motor goes out then thats it. I dont expect years of use but only lasting a year is not right. If you use this to inflate car tires or a raft or something you will get even less than a year out of this....I do not recommend & I will not be buying any Bonaire products in the future."
4,Bon-Aire BA121L Compressor/Inflator,This compressor performed as advertised..and it appears that the on-board pressure gage is very accurate. Sure beats paying $0.75 every time I need to fight with a 'snake' of an air hose at the local gas station.
1,"Mine Broke, Too","I don't write many reviews, but I felt it necessary to write one for this air compressor/inflator. I bought this product so we would have something handy to use when our car tires got low. I would say that we got about 10 uses out of it over the 20 months that we've owned it. Went to fill the tires the other day and just got a hissing noise with no air. Looks like the compressor is bad. This inflator saved us a couple of times, but I would not recommend it. I'm going to look for something more reliable on Amazon."
2,Unit failed in less than 2 years,"I received this air inflator as a gift in May 2008. It works great when it is working. It pumps air pretty quick and I can give 2 to 3 lbs. of air to a tire in less than 30 seconds. I typically use it once a month and handle it with care to avoid over heating by turning the unit off when I am not pumping air to the tire. However, this unit failed on me after 20 months of service. Not very durable when I am only using it on the average of once a month. I don't think I have used it in a way to cause it to over heat either. It just bit the dust. The unit just have a short life span."
2,Okay while it lasted,"I bought the Bon-Aire BA121L nearly two years ago after reading favorable reviews here. Until today, it worked exactly as I expected from the reviews: powerfully, but not quickly. The unit is labeled with a warning about cycle times. I was careful to use it less than 10 minutes at a time, and it could fill a very low tire in less than 10 minutes.I probably used this inflator every two or three months. It worked fine for ten or twelve uses, but today I hooked it up, turned it on, and it sputtered and died.Doing the math: I bought the BA121L to avoid paying $.50 per use at the corner convenience store. Instead, it cost me about $5.00 per use. I've made more expensive mistakes, but won't make particular this mistake again."
1,Mal-Aire: burns out too fast,"I purchased the identical item but under the Sears Craftsman name about 1 year ago. I used it no more than a dozen times during the year to inflate bicycle and car tires and my kids' basketballs. It did a great job and I was very satisfied with how well it worked for such a small pump. That is, until I needed to inflate an almost flat car tire. Then, like another reviewer's experience, after a couple of minutes it overheated and I could smell the distinct odor of melting electrical components. It was dead. What can you say about a product that gives up the ghost after such little use? ""Look for another that can do the job AND holds up to the use."""
4,Bon-Aire Inflator compressor,I found this to be a good product. A better design and quieter than the Black & Decker air station. I recommend it for tires and small items.Large items may take a while though.
1,Gone-Aire,"This unit worked great for a couple of months of light use topping off auto and truck tires at home. Then it started to slow down, accompanied by a nasty burning odor. At that point I stopped using it.This item has a one year warranty. On page 2 of the operator's manual it states, ""Bon-Aire Industries, Inc. warrants this product for a period of 1 year from the date of purchase against any defects that are due to faulty materials or workmanship. Please return to seller of this product for credit or free replacement"".So, I sent an e-mail to Amazon. They replied, ""Unfortunately, because more than 30 days have passed since you received this item, we can no longer accept a return"". So much for a warranty.There appears to be a similar device sold by Sears. Sears item # 02875117000. The reviews of the Sears Compressor have been less than stellar.On a positive note, the pressure gauge still works !!!"
1,Disappointing product life span,"Like other reviewers, I bought this compressor for light-duty occasional use, for maintaining pressure in auto and bike tires. It performed well for a period, then after I'd owned it less than a year and a half, it suddenly slowed down and stopped completely, never to breathe again. Total run time on the unit was probably around 30-45 minutes, and I'd never used it more than two minutes in a single day. What really irks me about it is that when I bought it, I was replacing a similar compact compressor that I'd used for 15+ years, and I'd passed up less-expensive models to buy what I'd hoped was a quality unit. For this kind of performance, this compressor's price point should be in the $20-$25 range instead of two to three times that amount; there's no way I can recommend it."
2,Not bad while it lasted.,"Purchased this unit from a local Sears in March 2009. Very lightly used since then, however the unit has a tendency to get quite hot when just topping of tires with 5-10 psi. Noticed oil dripping out of the bottom (probably bad seal in the compressor housing) today when the unit smoked and seized. I guess it is pretty typical of this sort of Made in China product."
3,Light duty only,Useless if you need more than 55 PSI. Worked well for 3 year as a light duty compressor but the first time that it was used for anything above 40psi it took forever and started to smoke before it got to 55psi - and yes - I rested it according to the manual!
5,This is a great air compressor,"I bought this compressor nearly 2 years ago. I love it. I use it just about every day for my bike tires. I ride about 12 miles daily, and like to keep my tires right at 70psi, and find I need to top them off almost daily. The guage isn't quite accurate, but I use an old fashion pressure guage to check. I find it is about 8 points off. But, I keep the compressor in my garage, it's hot here in South Texas, and I see no ill-effects from being stored in a hot area. It is powerful, and does it's job quickly. I have not tried it on automotive tires."
1,Unit Died on me,"This unit performed well after I purchased in June of last year, saw no activity during the winter months and was only used to inflate my bicycle tires (less than 30 seconds per week use). I Used it once this year before the unit basically gave up the ghost, cannot endorse this item"
1,Stopped working!,"Like several others have said, mine failed after just a few months of light use. Seems the motor burned out. Would avoid this piece of junk."
2,Poor Quality,"I bought this for inflating car and bike tires and kid toys. It works just fine for minor inflation. However, if the unit runs for more than five minutes or so it quickly overheats. I was inflating a kiddie pool and unit says let it cool 10 minutes for every 10 minutes of operation, after 4 minutes it overheated and died. I contacted bon aire who were generally helpful and advised my experience was unusual and thus sent me a new unit (had to pay $10 shipping). Unit worked fine for small issues, but inflating low RV tires it got hot (so I only used in for 3 minutes at a time with 5 minute cooling period to be real safe), however, later on it pumped slower and slower until (even for short periods) and doesn't work again. For what it can do, it costs too much and considering what says it can do - it can't."
3,An okay tire inflator,"It does what it's supposed to do - inflate tires. A couple things I don't like: It takes a while to get upto correct tire pressure. This is not really a problem, but I had a previous inflator that did the job much faster, so it's a matter of what you're used to. Other dislike/problem: the hose attachment to the tire valve does not release easily. I have found that you can't just pull the attachment away from the valve without loosing a lot of air. I have to ""unscrew"" the fitting from the valve. It attaches to the valve stem okay, but release is a bummer. I do, however, like the way the power cable and air tube store inside and around the unit."
1,"Looks good, works bad","This air compressor has all the right features that one could ask for in a small home air compressor. I've had two of them, and they have both burned out after one summer season. I used the two units for stull like airing up basketballs, soccer balls and bike tires. I probably used it 20-25 times per summer. Both units stopped working, one almost catching fire. Don't waste your money on the Bon-Aire air compressor."
1,"Not once, but twice. The product stopped working.","I trusted the reviews and ordered it. It worked fine for about 4+ months. After which, I could hear the motor but no air was coming out. There was a nasty smell of a burning motor. I saw the reviews and figured I got a lemon. I ordered a second one and the same thing happened - this time after 5 months. I wanted to share my experience of a terrible product with you."
2,"Hose needed repair at 32 months, motor failed at 35 months","Nice little pump for as long as it lasted.I bought mine just about 3 years ago under the Air-Xpress label.At about 2.5 years the hose sprang a leak close to the unit (the hose was crumbling where it came out of the compressor). I repaired it effectively with duct tape. Cleaning the hose periodically and not bending it too much near the base should help it last longer.At a month short of 3 years, I went to use it and it was dead. So now I am looking for a new pump.The gauge was not too accurate. The unit even suggests you turn it off with the hose attached to get a more accurate reading. For my car tires I had to over inflate by about 5 psi to get the desired pressure.It should have lasted longer, but while it lasted, it was very handy and worked well enough. I don't intend to replace my pump with another one of this kind.Bruce[...]"
5,Good Tire Pump,"I had the Sears version of this before and it broke. Its motor was still working but I think the rubber mechanism inside either dried up or broke so no air was pumped. I probably had this for 3 years using it once a week in the last two years.The Bon-Aire seemed to be the exact version albeit in a yellow casing versus black. It inflates tires much quicker compared to another 12 volt (cigarette lighter plug-in) compressor. The only reason I might use the 12 volt compressor is easier access since the Bon-Aire requires me to pull out the extension cord, etc. I keep the 12v in my car for easier access and emergencies.As with all compressor air gauges, this one does not match the reading of a dedicated air gauge. Don't rely on it and have a good dedicated air gauge to check your tire pressure.You can't beat the convenience of having one of these available in the home. Also use it to pump up bike tires, balls, large inflatables."
4,Does what it says it does,"This is a nice product - it does a solid job inflating car tires, air mattresses, balls, etc. Nice compact package as well. It takes about 2-3 minutes to do an air mattress from empty to full."
1,Junk,"I bought this thing about 2 years ago and have never been happy with it. It takesforever to inflate, the attaching mechanism for the tire was very, very difficultto close. I can't imagine a woman having the hand strength to close it in orderto pump air into the tires.But this morning it gave out completely. I would never recommend this unit to anyone.My advice....look elsewhere!!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"It might seem like a good deal, but you'll be sorry! Yep, it burned out on the 3rd use...the machine appears to be a total loss, well, except for the fireworks display of the now burned-out electric motor throwing sparks everywhere. Amazon agreed to return it after the date, and now it's costing them too."
1,Not well built,Used compressor only a dozen times before it just broke. Vibrated apart. Would not recommend to anyone who needs a dependable compressor.
1,Disappointed,"This inflator worked well for 2 years and then just overheated and died. I try to buy quality products that will last as I try to think about the environmental impact of my choices. So if you want something for the short term, this is it. Long term, look elsewhere."
1,hose failure,Worked OK at first but didn't last more than a year -- the problem -- the rubber hose cracked and leaked so the air pressure was not sustained. Waste of money.
1,DON'T BUY THIS...,"This is a DVR-R disc (homemade), but that's not the problem... whoever mastered it used the wrong aspect ratio, so the film plays in widescreen format, elongating the characters' faces. Shame, because the print looks decent. And no, changing the aspect ratio on your television doesn't help matters."
1,Another wretched transfer,"Don't be fooled by the cover art... This is yet another choppy, badly spliced public domain transfer. The opening credits are missing..."
2,Whose idea was this?,"While I love the cover artwork, the rest of the program isn't really all that sexy. The problem is that she's pretending to be SATC's Samantha Jones. I love SATC, but it's lame when an actor acts ""in character"" away from the show itself. In fact, it's embarrassing. Not only that, but the presentation isn't very good. Kim deserves credit for trying. Older women are very sexy. It's just a shame Kim Cattrall didn't host this instead of ""Samantha-lite""."
1,Absolutely nothing to learn - or to enjoy,"I saw this video on Netflix via my free trial on my Playstation so I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it. I am a huge SATC fan, and I disagree that Kim was playing Samantha - she really wasn't. If she had, there might have been some redeeming qualities to the show. It was exceedingly boring (who cares about Aphrodite, nude statues of David etc?), it offered no new information whatsoever (regardless of your age), and the production value was amateur at best. Bad all around. Another reviewer said ""someone must have had it in for Kim Cattrall to put her in this thing"". Well, she must have it in for herself as this was HER production, based on her book by the same name. I do not believe it was an HBO product either - at the end it had a Discovery logo."
4,Dance with the rhythm,"Afro,Bombo,Tribal,Deep,Groove,Samba,LATIN.All in 1.I think that only with 30 secds. of lisenting I can say it's a good cd it's good sound.That's all folks.Get the money and spend it.Bye"
4,Good product.,"The Cuisinart Universal Double Boiler works great, but then I have Cuisinart pots and pans. But it does what it says it will do and fits with different pots and pans. I've been very pleased. I make my own yogurt and the milk no longer burns in the pot. Beautiful."
4,Cuisinart Double Boiler,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law (she had a Cuisinart pot set but no double boiler), so I haven't actually used it myself. It arrived promptly, the box was in perfect condition as was the pan, and it looked like a good quality item. I don't think I would try a double boiler that was not of the same brand, but if I had a Cuisinart set, I would buy this item for myself."
2,Cuisinart Double Boiler,This boiler does not fit snug in the base 3 quart kettle. It might be ok for the 4 qt kettle.
5,Compiled with ultimate sensibilities,"Henry Scott-Irvine is to be commended for his hand-picked selection of some of Procol Harum's greatest songs, including Cerdes (Outside the Gates of), Fantastic shots of the band from the early years with excellent liner notes. A great value at this price!"
4,Things Have Changed a Bit,"I bought this book because I have so many memories of playing many of these games when I was a little girl, and I wanted to share that experience with my child.I was a little disappointed because many of the words are quite different from how I learned them. But it is probably unreasonable for me to expect anything different.If you can get past the fact that these games aren't 100 percent identical to how you played them as a child, you'll find this to be a really helpful guide."
1,But the cover looked so cute!!,The rest... not so much! The illustrations were really disappointing inside the book. I was going to give this book to my daughter and niece but decided not to after looking through it. It could have been a really cute book.
1,Miss Mary Mack,Disappointing. I knew very few of the rhymes. It's hard to say them right when you don't kow the rhythm.
5,Entertaining and educational!,"Brian P. Cleary has a great way of introducing and explaining pronouns to children in this book! My students have enjoyed all his books that he has written about the different parts of speech, and I have purchased everyone that he has written! He has made a boring subject entertaining and educational."
3,Wait for the Complete Series!,"After I bought this DVD that only has 4 episodes, I found out that Sam Nelson (Ricky Nelson's son) is actually raising money to restore the entire 435-episode series of ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" and include the original commercials too! He hopes to have the entire series restored by the time ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" is inducted into the Smithsonian. The complete series should be ready roughly around December 2014."
3,Yawn...,"I never thought I'd say this, but this it the worst that Saint Etienne has put out. I've always been excited to see new Saint Etienne discs, but this was bad... I felt I had been taken.Before I'm bashed, let me explain...this CD is a repeat of a lot that has been produced already. The only new stuff was the instrumentals and they sounded a lot like existing stuff too.For any new Saint Etienne fans, I think your money would be better spent on ""Tiger Bay"", ""Good Humor"" or a compilation disc. Even Sarah Cracknell by herself is good stuff.Try to steer clear of this CD."
1,Very disappointed,"We purchased this R/C jeep at a local department store, in hopes that it would provide our son with many hours of fun. We were incredibly disappointed. The Jeep is geared too high and runs too fast; it's very hard for young R/C users to control the vehicle. Although it ran fast across flat ground, our son's Jeep would barely climb up the driveway. And the battery life was ridiculous. He barely had 30 minutes of playtime on a fully charged battery.We have had the Jeep for two days and have been very disappointed. We paid $50 retail for the truck and felt like we were purchasing a quality product. We plan to do more research before our next purchase."
5,Hauppauge WinTV-UB TV Tuner,Have had this tuner about a month. Excellent product fot the price. Good viewing quality. Very reasonable capture quality. Low to medium demands on the computer's CPU. Runs cool to the touch. I would recomend this item to anyone who wants a USB TV tuner that won't bog down their computer. Software installed the first time with no problems. My laptop is an HP Pavilion 2000 series. Hope this helps someone else
4,Manufacturer Recommended,"I was pretty distraught when my very expensive hunting rain gear developed a leak, from years of wear. I called the manufacturer, and they recommendedthe Nikwax Softshell Twin Pack, and also suggested Amazon as ther supplier. I used the product, and it restored my rainsuit to its original condition. Couldn't be happier."
5,Am I the only one who still has a copy of this?,"I too love this book, and I apparently am the only one here who has taken good care of her copy, as it's still around and last time I checked not even falling apart. I agree with all the praise and would like to add that the book is also full of wonderfully realized secondary characters, an area in which far too many writers fall short.Oddly enough, GILDED SPURS, which she wrote as Ingram, is a prequel to POWER OF DARKNESS, which she wrote as Adams; there is at least one character who appears in both. I think POWER OF DARKNESS is very nearly as good as RED ADAM'S LADY, but I didn't care for GILDED SPURS at all. The protagonist was likeable, but nobody else was; and if I remember correctly, there wasn't a romance."
5,"This is a love story, not a romance","And to me, there's a big difference between the two.This is one of my favorite books ever. I once owned a hard copy, and it broke my heart when I lost it. This is not your run-of-the-mill bodice rippers; this is actually a historically correct, realistic, and totally fascinating story. Ingram takes you right into the details and politics of what life was like for the real people, not the perfumed toadies in court. The times were perilous and things could (and did!) change in the blink of an eye.Julitta is one of the strongest fictional heroines I've read, and I love how the relationship between her and Red Adam develops. They're not perfect people, but they are honorable and they are perfect for each other. Even if Julitta doesn't believe it for quite a while -- maybe because she doesn't. This is not a hot, lustful romp; it's a love story set in a dangerous historical time, and it's really the best ""historical romance"" I've ever read."
5,Sphinx045 is on this CD,"Sphinx045 blazes some hot lyrics out on the bonus track. Look for his new CD titled ""Antidisestablishment"" coming this year. That whiteboy has the hottest song on the whole CD, P.Diddy need to holla at that boy 4real!!!!! Move over Paul Wall"
4,I'm ready for this jelly!!,"This is a great dance song..this is the faster version of Bootylicious, being the original one..but I would also recommend the Rockwilder remix which is featured on the Carmen soundtrack, it's slower and features Missy Elliot..this is the best single they have put out from this album so far and I would definately recommend this!"
4,The Better To See Them By,"I am very happy with the Bushnell Spotting Scope - it is easy to adjust, works well while wearing glasses and is the perfect scope for watching freighters and pleasure boats outside my living room window!"
4,Bushnell Scope,"Because of the severe winter I haven't been able to test the spotting scope thoroughly. However, when I have been able to use it it performed well. I do wish, however, that it came with a lens cap."
3,Less Engaging that the Rest of their Work,"Stereolab is probably one of the most original and daring groups of the 90's, but this record is not as good as the rest of their work. Though it has sweet rock melodies and dynamic songs, it would be a good Stereolab record if it would be their first. Is as if they had lost their inspiration in the process of making this album. Fortunately, it came before masterpieces like ""Emperor Tomato Ketchup"" (their best so far) and the underrated ""Dots and Loops"". If people say that this album is better than ""Dots"", they are overrating this album."
1,is so often the case with stereolab,"One always has to becareful with stereolab some of their stuff is truly wonderful. But this album like some of their other has a grinding organ on each track. Why the groop thinks this organ is so wonderful is beyond me. The groop writes and plys beutiful music and then they ruin it by putting in that ""grating on your nerves"" organ. bachelor pad music is a perfect example of this."
3,"big typo, but hey, it rocks","the typo in the title aside, this album is as satisfactory as you could expect from early stereolab, though way too short. however, tracks like ""uhf-mfp"" or ""we're not adult orientated"" (sic) are memorable."
1,No Bachleor Pad Music Here,Don't let the cover fool you.............if your looking for some chill music..........get dots and loops
4,Good basic cookbook,"This is a good basic cookbook whether or not one is diabetic. This is not gourmet but basic good food, most of which can be prepared relatively quickly. Not all of the dishes are from scratch which can be a plus if you are not into alot of cooking but a minus if you dislike most commercial prepared foods. Nice variety of dishes and all have nutritional information, saves lots of time for diabetics!The meal plans in the back are based on a fairly sedendary life style, so if you are active forget about these plans (or increase the portion sizes)."
5,Great Recipies!,"Using the recipies in this book and the advice of my doctor, I've lost over 100 pounds. I'm not diabetic, but I have family members who are. Both these family members were prescribed the exchange diet. I had my doctor adapt the diet to my needs. I bought this book and have enjoyed every recipie I have tried. All the dishes in this book contain easy to obtain ingredients and require minimal prep time."
3,A Little Too complicated,"Recipes were not fast and simple like some other books, but some are interesting. Info was also presented in more detail than I was looking for. If you are ""studying"" diabetes to learn about it and not so much about the management of it, you will like this book. I was looking for fast info easy to prepare and get husbands diet into foods he likes."
3,"Helpful, but...","the 30-Day Diabetes Miracle is more effective. I highly recommend it for managing your diabetes and creating a whole new healthy lifestyle. It's a better plan at controlling insulin resistance, blood sugar, etc.The 30-Day Diabetes Miracle: Lifestyle Center of America's Complete Program to Stop Diabetes, Restore Health,and Build Natural VitalityThe 30-Day Diabetes Miracle Cookbook: Stop Diabetes with an Easy-to-Follow Plant-Based, Carb-Counting Diet"
3,All crystals came with chipped... Still shows a lot of rainbows,They are beautiful and arrived quickly. But all three crystals came with chipped about 2-5 spots each one.They are Definitely NOT for gift to me.It's too bad that I was planning to give them to my friend... I decided to keep them for myself. Because they still make a lot of rainbows and it's so beautiful.
1,Pious fraud,"It's Milk the Christians time again, folks. This book was written as a work of fiction in the 1880s and was exposed by Rev. Goodspeed (the fellow who first edited and compiled the modern English edition of the Pseudepigrapha) in the 1930s.Read it for entertainment, the way you'd read Ben Hur."
5,Foundational Principles that establish your life,"David's book is founded on core principles that will guide you to building a life of consequence and meaning - you will establish daily habits that ensure that your gifts, talents and skills are fully utilised and developed and simultaneously ensure that you build and enrich the relationships with friends and family - an essential purchase for those serious about leaving a personal imprint in this world."
5,A Book of Passion and Politics,"To this educated reader, the work on Heydrich will be of great interest to anyone who wants to go beyond the level of undergraduate or cable channel history on personalities of the Third Reich, and those who would give their lives to stop the spread of its ideas. It is really a testimonial to Czech patriotism, but those who know (and you should) about the Wannsee conference in January 1942 (see the DVD Conspiracy or the German video The Wannsee Conference) will be interested also in Heydrich, who was rumored to be a Mischling (half-Jew). The photos are rough, the tale is compelling."
3,Heydrich assassination illustrated,The book describes briefly the story Heydrich assassination.You can hardly learn something about Heydrich himself and his role in terrible events of WWII.The book is worth only if you are looking for photo documentary.
3,good book,"well, she was a great person. and i had to do a history project on her, and i found this book very helpful!"
5,"Per gli amanti di Rossini e del ""bel canto""","Eccezionale esecuzione sotto tunti i punti di vista. Ottime le voci, in particolar modo quella di Jennifer Larmor, che del resto non ha bisogno del mio plauso...Lo consiglio vivamente anche ai più critici ed esigenti."
3,Keyboard as good as original,Keyboard was as good as the original. Needed this to replace a bad keyboard.a) The keyboard arrived in bubble wrapped envelope. It was tightly stuffed into the mailbox. It took extra time and precaution to extract it out of the mailbox.b) The connector tape was shorter than what one would expect.
5,Great service and nice product,Really nice packaging and is legitimately an RCA cable. The cable seems like really good quality. Only problem was that the first cable I got was a little loose at the connectors and that caused some interference. I sent an email to the seller and they immediately sent a replacement no questions asked. The second one was absolutely perfect.
2,Cheap parts,The metallic connector at the end was too weak and broke out while I was trying to rotate it to fix it. I don't think I was doing it roughly. Cheap product!
5,good quality-RCA 6' digital coaxial,"This product has a very good quality. After I replace it with my current coaxial cable to connect my LCD TV to Directive Receiver, the picture gets much clear."
1,Garbage!!,DO NOT waste your money. If the ends don't break off during initial instalation the reception on your TV is horrible. I bought 3 of these and not one of them worked properly.
1,High Resistance unusable for OTA/Public Television,"I don't right reviews often but when I do its because I either very much love or hate a product. This is a case of the latter. I figured you can't screw up a coax cable, that the cable is fine, and that the other negative reviews were just people with bad luck. I was wrong. I hooked up the cable from the COAX jack on the wall to my media centers TV Tuner and was able to pick up 1 signal. The other TV Tuner (they are identical Hauppage models) was able to pick up at least 30+ channels with the coax cable I had picked up locally. Moved that cable to the 2nd TV Tuner and it detects all the channels but hook this cable back up and nothing but static.STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS CABLE!!!"
5,Our Native Japanese sensei likes this book!,"We are studying Japanese with a native speaker. In preparation for classes, we purchased several Japanese language books, and this one is, by far, the most useful and relevant!! The Japanese language has so many unique aspects, and it is very easy to use the incorrect word for a specific situation..... But our teacher looked over the various books we had, and said this is the best one! The examples it gives, in various situations, are very up to date and compatible with contemporary spoken Japanese. The book is easy to follow, and if you are learning on your own, this book, along with an overall pronunciation app or CD would be very useful."
5,Awesome book!,"I love this book so much! Its easy to connect to. It has visual pictures and name captions. All of its romaji. No actual Japanese characters. If you plan on just SPEAKING Japanese, and want to know what these things are, then i would recommend this book (:"
3,Sunset in the West,"Thanks to the censors, Mae West's final film for Paramount is a tame little farce that trades heavily on the star's (fairly lame) impersonation of a brunette Frenchwoman. Dressed by Schiaparelli, she looks great, but it's a dull affair."
3,A challenging read,This reprint by Scholars Facsimiles & Reprints is a good reproduction of the original book of 1482. The practical problems for a non-academic reader like me is that the typeface is really old - similar to to traditional German typefaces and the English is pre-Shakespearean.A better choice is Mehmed II the Conqueror: And the Fall of the Franco-Byzantine Levant to the Ottoman Turks: Some Western Views and Testimonies (Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies) Marios Philippides (Editor) This book includes the Siege of Rhodes by Guillaume Caoursin but in readable typeface as well as a number of other essential translations from the period of Mehmed II.Note that most of the Scholars Facsimiles reprint is taken up by a collection of Aesop's Fables illustrated with woodcuts. This also is in the antique typeface but it would be a delight for lovers of early English books and literature.
4,A picture is worth......,"Couples: Speaking from the Heart is interesting reading for anyone intriqued by the mystery of relationships. The masterfully done photographs give more richness to the words of people, some famous some not, who attempt to do the impossible: put words to their relationships, how they have succeeded, how they have grown. It makes for entertaining reading, but it also creates in the reader both a desire to understand how relationships work and a wonder that when they do, it is a glorious thing. A different kind of book, but invigorating in its unique way."
5,"For Christians facing burnout, this is must reading.","This book is practical, readable, and worthwhile. Even if you're so burned out you can hardly face another book, this one is worth the time! Lots of case histories and real life examples, so you know the authors have dealt with real people. Very solid biblical foundation. Non-technical explanations make it easy reading for anyone. Solid, practical suggestions for avoiding or escaping burnout. This is two books put together in one volume. Reading this book helped me identify the strengths and weaknesses, as well as the potential hazards of my own personality type. Best book on the subject I've seen."
1,overbearing and pompous,This self-congratulatory tome spends most of its time ignoring the literature and instead giving potted summaries that say more about the author's inability to understand literature than they do about the books themselves. A number of very talented writers have discussed inter-relations between law and literature -- such as Robert Ferguson and Brook Thomas -- but this book does not deserve to be included among them.
5,"Tight, insightful, and truly scholarly.","I must admit a bias for Posner because much of his thinking about law and economics has influenced my thoughts and opinions. Needless to say it was a pleasant surprise to find this book that handles the law-literature relationship as well as the relationship between law and economics. There is an eclectic selection of books and poems reviewed, and the organization is impeccable. The most important thing that I can say about this book is that it introduced and encouraged me to read other fields of literature that I had ignorantly dismissed in the past as being irrelevant."
1,Will not work on an 2011 F150,I had to return these wheel locks. Mcgaurd says they fit a 2011 F150. I have a FX4 and the factory nut bevel area is twice as large as the lock nuts. I didn't feel comfortable with that much difference on a 4X4 wheel when off roadside. I will order a set from the Ford dealer.
2,"OK, but I liked their other on better","This was a good book, but their other book, The Value Mandate, was easier to read, and it looked better. The interior design of this book is hard on the eyes. It's not approprite for a business book. The Value Mandate LOOKS like a business book --- this book does not."
2,NOT ASSORTED,"We buy these every month - we love them, but when you receive a box labeled assorted and there are only 2 flavors in it, I believe they call that false advertising!"
4,Great Blades!,You'll pay $8 for 1 in those other stores. At around $3.50 a piece their a steal. Thanks Amazon!
4,A carpenters best friend.,"As a carpenter, I depend on the Fein Multimaster with it's many different blades to get me out of jambs that one can get into on a dailey basis, there is allways something that needs to be cut that I can't get to with any other tool. Thus saving time and effort."
3,Handy product,Finding replacement accessories for the Fein is difficult. None of the big box stores carry it and when I ask all I get is the deer-in-headlights look. The price wasn't too bad although I think they can drop it a little. Overall I have found these accessories have come in very handy while doing a home remodel.
3,Good but,"Works, but kind of a pain to load the sandpaper and one of the profiles failed first time I used."
1,Profile Kit that doesn't do it.,"Over Priced & the sand paper is very hard to load & set it. When correctly set up, because of the high speed, the thing came apart & plastic parts shattered. One expensive piece of junk. Absolutely not worth the price after using it three times. Not a quality extra."
1,E-cut Combo Kit,"Thank you for the opportunity to submit my review on this product.These blades are way over priced for the amount of work you get from them.Blade #152 is a wood-metal blade and advertized as able to cut nails. The brochure and video show the blade cutting large nails. I tried this and after 3 nails the blade was no longer any good. No more teeth on the blade.Blade # 127 lost all the teeth after just 3 plunge cuts into a wood 2x4. The blade is now worthless.Blade #133 seems to work a little better. I have done a little bit of wood cutting with it and it seems to be holding up. I'm almost affraid to use it too much because I would not want to rush out and buy a new one right a way.Way too expensive!!!!NeilChehalis, WA"
2,Fein Multimaster E-Cut Combo Kit (3 Pack),"The Wood Holz Precision blade (the wide one) with the larger teeth is not acceptable. The first time that I used it, about ten of the teeth broke off, and the next time, another 10-15 teeth broke off. I was only cutting douglas fir and there were absolutely no nails in the wood. The blade was useless after just using it three times (only about 1/2"" of teeth remained). The other blades seem to be durable."
1,Safety Hazard item,"This item gets very hot and melts the rubber profile that holds the sand paper. This is my second purchase and the same problem occurred again and I have returned both for a refund. Caution do not use this item. I have notified the Fein company and it seems once you purchase any item they sell they have deaf ear to any problem the owner has. I have been using my Fein MultiMaster(FMM-250Q) tool with all of Fein's attachments for over 6 months with zero problems. However, when I had the problem with my first profile kit within one minute of operation the orange clamping device on one side melted and this caused the springs to come loose an airborne. I sent the defective item back to Amazon and asked for a replacement. Once I received the second profile kit, I had the same problem and returned the second profile kit. I then notified Fein and their response was it must be my MultiMaster tool. They do not acknowledge any problem with this item."
2,Lost teeth and got dull too fast,after just one use I had to throw the blade away. worked well for that one 5 minute use. but did not meet my expectations
2,A disappointment compared to the other Fein kits,"I've been disappointed with the profile kit . I find it nearly impossible to use. The spring-loaded clamp that holds the profile piece and the sandpaper is so tight that it is virtually impossible for me to properly install the profile and sandpaper in the clamp. When I am able to do so, I usually am unable to draw the sandpaper tightly over the profile. Therefore the paper wears prematurely and the sanding doesn't necessarily follow the desired profile. I thought the problem was my own weak hands but after reading these other reviews I see my experience is common enough. Fein, I would put this accessory to a lot of use if you would re-engineer it."
3,Fein blades,"Fein blades work very well on their multi-tool, but are extremely expensive. I am told by a neighbor who uses his much more often than I that there are blades from another vendor that cost much less. Even if they don't work as well, you can save tons o' money if you use this great tool all the time."
2,not a suitable tool for this application,"This tool is absolutely fabulous for doing the few things you will need it for, but and this is a BIG but (pun alert!) the replacement blades are VERY expensive--no joke, check the prices. The profile sanding attachment doesn't work worth a darn. Because of the rotary-vibratory motion of tool, the ends of the little piece of sandpaper do all the work and the center does nothing."
1,Profile Sander DANGEROUS,"LOVE the MultiMaster. 5 stars for sure. But the Profile Kit...wow, what a disaster. The rubber form kicks loose, the sand paper rips in under 1 minute, and I just seriously burned my palm trying to re-insert the sand paper. The metal parts get searingly hot. Everything else about the MultiMaster is fabulous."
1,Very disappointed,"It worked great for about five minutes. The pin that holds the orange clip to the metal frame fell apart, I mean it just melted and is now unusable"
3,Lots of Juice!!,"I bought this album for ""Break it to me gently"" The music is a little past its prime, but Juice has a wonderful set of pipes!! It's definately a throwback to the 80's and a lovely voice. I will probably keep it. It was an album of a love in my college days. She didn't ""Break it to me gently"""
5,What a classic!,"I'm not much of a country music fan, but Juice Newton converted me with her first song. This is a combination of her very best music and is an absolute classic. She sings from the heart and it's impossible to resist singing along with every song on this CD."
3,"easy read, but be wary of the ""history"" of civilizations","I enjoyed reading this book until I got to Chapter 5 which I found to be inaccurate about Islamic history, not to mention extremely offensive. It would be different if the statements were true, but they're untrue and unneccesarily harsh. Other than that, this book is easy to understand and is quite humorous. I would recommend it for people who would like to learn the history of math, but I feel there are better resources out there to learn about the history of civilizations."
2,Well...,...We have already rated and reviewed this product once and didn't think we'd have to do again. Enjoyable and would recommend.
2,Disappointing,This book has interesting characters and sub plots but I think the overall story is weak and the good guys have it too easy. I was disappointed.
1,Think before you buy this book!,"I am in the process of designing a new back yard with inground pool and spa. I have been reviewing several books to get ideas. If that is what you are looking for - keep looking you won't find much here. This book is more of a photojournal of neo contemporary pools from around the world. It covers about 30 pools (most look the same). The majority of them are very contemporary recatngles with no decks. Just look at the cover - there are 29 more pools that look just like it inside. On the same note these pools are all in million dollar homes and are not very impressive unless you love plain, sleek, rectangular pools with minimal landscaping and concreate decks. Sorry I just didn't get it."
5,Beautiful Music....,I have the original LP from The Strawbs and the song ghost is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard!
3,The beginning of a prog-pop phase.,"With the exception of the title cut and The Life Auction this is more a pop album than prog. Ghosts and Life Auction are similar in composition and tone to the songs on Hero and Heroine (their finest work). The rest of the material, where it is well executed, is really too straightforward in it's delivery and light and ""pop""-like in sound. In spite of the exceptional musicianship it misses the dense complexity of their finer efforts. Still enjoyable, just not essential...Simon"
1,Terrible!,"Camera wouldn't even turn on, even when I replaced the battery's. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. Very disappointed!"
3,Not overly impressed...,"I was somewhat disappointed when this arrived because, like another review said, it came stuffed in a box with the neck bent, and it seemed smaller than I was expecting. If you are expecting it to be 30 inches from the head to ground (not including the legs) be warned that it is quite a bit smaller and the measurement listed must include the length of the legs. I think it was a questionably average value for what I paid, but I wouldn't have bought it for the current, higher listed price. I would consider it a large stuffed animal but certainly not ""Jumbo"".At least I can say this, It's good that my son doesn't know the difference between what he has and what I was expecting. He's happy with it."
3,just ehhh,"The stuffed animal is a little too floppy . . . but maybe I expect too much? All I know is that the neck of the giraffe won't stay up for a second. Maybe, it's just physically impossible? Who knows, but that is my only gripe about it."
5,A wonderful stuffed animal. Great to cuddle with or sit on.,This was a gift for my granddaughter. I know she sleeps with it every night. It is big enough for a child to sit on to watch television.
3,"Good solo singing, but Masur is lackluster","Every two years or so I seem to buy a new War Requiem to see how it stacks up against the classic premiere recording under the composer on Deca. So far, the only nes I've thrown away are the Gardiner and this one under Masur. The execution per se is excellent. The orchestra and various choruses sound fine, and they are captured in very good sound. Hampson is better than the callow Hadley among the male soloists, but neither sounds quite right--too american in a quintessentially British work.In the end, however, it's Masur, as always. He never seems to reach beyong a dutiful, uninspired proficiency, and his approach often lacks fire. That's the case in this overly cautious performance of a work that demands heightened emotions to come off at its best. I can imagine someone liking this performaance well enough, but it's far form a first choice."
2,Not a bad price for 5 Ramekins,"These are cute little ramekins, great for dipping sauces, prep containers, or setting out toppings such as sprinkles or nuts. A bit small for souffles. One of the six ramekins arrived cracked, in spite of good packing by Amazon. Not adequate packing by the original supplier. Still, it did not seem worth returning. (Still not a bad price, even though only 5 were functional.)"
2,Might have been fine,"These 2-ounce Ramekins would have been just perfect, but for the fact that they arrived broken."
4,2oz ramekin - just the right size,"The two ounce ramekins arrive unscathed and in good shape. The only problem with the ramekins was the very very sticky label affixed to the bottom of the container. I ordered twelve and would recommend to anyone, thanks."
4,Nice,"They Are Nice, But Do Not Set On Top Of Each Other Like It Is Depicted On The Picture.There Are Other Sizes From This Company That Does Fit\Set On The Inter lip."
5,Lush and evocative.,"I only wish this book were still available in hardback. What a satisfying combination of Steinbeck, brilliant photographs of California geography, and California history. It's the perfect gift for the intelligent foreign visitor to the Golden State."
1,Not worth the money,"Having built a couple of pole barns in the mid 1980's and having a project in mind, I was looking for a book that would contain some newer ideas and techniques. This is not the book, if you want to read about a bunch of 1970's ex hippies (printing date is 1980)building a small pole cottage out of old telephone poles its perfect. For any useful construction information pass on this one and look else where"
2,Material Dated,"Material is quite dated (looks like 60's and 70's). Deals with utilization of ""phone poles"" as opposed to deminsional building which was my goal. (8x8 or 6x6.."
3,a bit outdated,"enjoyed it to an extent, but most info was old. some good info was included however and a good browse for those thinking about building."
2,a good start but the rest is very poor,"This album isn't anything special at all. The first song, ""At your funeral"" is amazing, as is track 2 ""See You"", but the rest are slow and mellow. This album is hardly punk at all, more emo-rock, which is fine if you like that sort of thing. It seems as though Saves the Day have tried to make an album like Green Day's Warning, which is much better. Stay what You Are is too slow, and too relaxing. Songs like Freakish and Nightingale almost put me to sleep, not what i want to be doing whilst listening to a emo/punk album! This is a poor atempt from Saves the Day, it seems they have matured too quickly, they need to come up with faster heavier tunes, and more catchy lyrics, like in ""at Your Funeral"" if they wish to compete with other punk bands, such as New Found Glory, Midtown or Alister"
4,Fav band on Vagrant,"I never really listened to Saves the Day until I saw the video for 'Freakish' (I a poser, whatever), but I must say that I DID buy this cd on a whim and am not at all dissapointed. Chris's Voice is amazing, I love more awkward sounding vocals (such as Cedric from At the Drive In/Mars Volta, or Isaac from Modest Mouse) because they sound natural, or at least more natural than say someone who has classical training.Saves the Day does remind me a lot of Texas is the Reason, I guess it's because both bands have a great sense of melody and the same type of lyrics. Not that it's a bad thing, Texas is the Reason was great, and one of my favorite bands (even though they only released one cd). Some songs get a little annoying like ""Cars and Calories"" and ""Jukebox Breakdown"", but every other song is great, especially ""At YOur Funeral"", ""Freakish"", ""See You"" and ""As Your Ghost Takes Flight""."
2,good stuff but-,"ok- saves the day has great music, great lyrics, etc, but the lead singer's voice is REALLY annoying. i try to listen to this, but the singer just makes me rip my head phones off and curse life. get some other dude to sing and i'll be fine."
1,0 Stars IF POSSIBLE,ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS SELL-OUT. YOU POSERS AND ITS MY JOB TO KEEP PUNK ROCK ELITE.(NOFX).
5,Maturity Does Wonders,"I couldn't wait till this CD came out, I had Through Being Cool and Can't Slow Down and eagerly awaited a new release. I'll have to admit, with the first listen of this album I was extremely disappointed with the exception of At Your Funeral and See You. I was disgusted, they sounded completely different. However each time I listened to the CD again I liked a new song, until I couldn't get enough of this CD. If you listen to their other albums you can clearly see how they have matured. From insanely fast lyrics and riffs which lived up to the title, Can't Slow Down, to Through Being Cool which is one of my favorite emo CD's. Stay What You Are is a completely different sound, but excellent in its own right. Chris Conley proves himself as one of the best voices in the punk world. Disturbing lyrics with a backdrop of very soothing rythyms makes Stay What You Are one of the best CD's from last year. Saves the Day is one of the greatest and most unique bands around."
2,What happened?,"Yes, what happened? Granted, Saves The Day has always been a lyrically clever/repetitive band. And I accept that. I embrace it. But I fell in love with them, in July of 2001. I loved them a lot. Then I saw them live, in August of 2001, and it made me so happy. I saw them with another not so popular band, Dashboard Confessional. Here I am spreading the love of STD, putting their great ""Through Being Cool"" songs on loving mix tapes for friends. I get them all psyched up. Then, STD poops up an album called ""Stay What You Are"" releases. I download every song right away! I liked it. I still do like it, but there are some songs that I just can't deal with. Number two, I forget the name but boy do I remember the lyrics. I believe it goes something like ""I don't have the stomach to stomach you."" Catchy, but not repeted all the times it is. It made me feel cheated. So, take heeding upon buying/ pirating this CD. You may feel it's a waste of money."
4,Made me Blow My load too soon,"the first time i lisetened to the CD i was like, ""Freak Yeah!, this CD rocks!"" Then i kept on listening to it and got a little burnt out....i just recenently started to listen to it again, and rediscovering how great it is."
4,Just Keeps Getting Better,"When I first heard this CD, Saves the Day just seemed like another punk band...which was fine with me because punk as a genre is excellent. But as I listened to this CD again and again I liked it more and more each time. Maybe the lyrics arent as catchy as some of their older stuff ( with the exception of ""See You"") but I found many of them deep and relatable. ""This Is Not An Exit"" and ""Freakish"" are two songs that for the past three months I have listened to every day. Some songs are sad while others lift my spirits completely. This CD is one of my all time favorites, but if your looking for song after song about losing a girl, then look somewhere else."
4,Pretty cool,"I saw these guys live, but they don't look so good on stage. This cd rocks, especially Firefly and At Your Funeral. Take a look, but don't look to hard, cause you might burn your eyes. A really good punk album with SERIOUS lyrics."
2,Save your money for the first album,"I have been a huge Saves The Day fan since their debut album Can't Slow Down. Over the years I have watched Save The Day get progressivly slower and more main stream. Needless to say, I am dissapointed in their latest release. If you haven't picked it up yet, save your money for Can't Slow Down. It's Epic."
1,This CD is horrible.,"This CD is a weak attempt to get onto alternative radio. If you want to meet a bunch of whiny 14-year-old girls, be sure to check out Saves the Day's boring live act, though."
2,This has my favorite Saves the Day song,"At Your Funeral is a great song. Unfortunately, the rest of this album is total trash. After such an improvement on Can't Slow Down with Through Being Cool, I thought this CD might actually be good. Unfortunately, this is even worse than Can't Slow Down, although in a different way. Certain Tragedy is catchy for 30 or so seconds, but I can't listen to it more than once in the same week without being tempted to cut off my ears. And it is my second favorite song on the CD. This CD is not worth the money, and it probably isn't worth the money you'd spend on a CDR to burn a copy. Just download At Your Funeral."
1,Waste of Money!!!!,"Having high hopes from saves the day album ""through being cool"", i decided to buy there new album ""stay what you are"". What i didn't realize is that it's completely different from their other albums. This album is slow and annoying and grows tiresome very quickly. I was hoping that they didn't change there material, but this album should be classified as wuss rock. If you want an awesome saves the day album, but ""through being cool"".....trust me, you won't be disappointed."
1,Major Disappointment,"Failing again to reach a mainstream audience, Saves the Day once again falls short of great punk standards...terrible songs, terrible lyrics...there are no bright spots to speak of...there is no originality, and no hooks...Blink 182, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, and Offspring may have sold out, but their music became more radio friendly as a result...fans like the one from Miami, FL need to realize that there's nothing the band could do to Saves the Record."
1,I wish I could rate it 0 stars,"There is a fine line between true emotion and whining. Saves The Day is not only on the wrong side of that line, the band has built a house over there with the money people waste to hear these kids whine about girls. Save your money please. Just because some 14 thinks it really relates to them doesn't make it good music. Take a word of advice from me, buy The Shins or something else."
1,hey cheer up,hey emo kids...cheer up this band is totally famous now I saw them on Mtv2 and they made me cry with their deep emotional metaphorical lyrics about lost love and uh..yeah that was it. Sniff Sniff
5,"I hate to say it, but this is awesome","So what if these guys aren't punk anymore. So what if all the 14 year old girls at Hot Topic think this is what emo is all about... labels and scenes aren't important, the music is, and as poppy and cheesy as this album is, these are some awesome songs. Tracks like ""See You"" and ""Freakish"" stuck in my head after only a couple of listens, and when I finally bought the album, the rest of it made it's way into my conciousness within a couple of weeks. This is just basic catchy power pop, nothing too fancy, with some clever lyrics and nice basslines. As much as it's not cool to like Saves the Day, this is better than anything scene darlings such as Superdrag have put out, and overall this is a very fun listen."
3,If this is maturity...stay young,"I love Saves the Day but though this CD has a few highlights they are way to far between. At Your Funeral is an awesome song but after that nothing lives up to the old stuff really. The sound isn't as fast as it once was and the lyrics aren't as polished as they once were. This isn't to say that Saves the Day can't make good slow songs, that far from the truth..(see I'm sorry I'm Leaving, awesome acoustic) This cd is a let down for me, it seems maybe either the label or the band itself are trying to get it to the mainstream which is what we don't need. I'm not one to say Saves the day sold out or anything, we'll have to see that in perhaps they're next cd, hopefully they'll revive themselves."
4,great cd...a little short.,"I think this cd is great. It's cute but morbid indie pop and I like every song. I especially like at your funeral and as your ghost takes flight. I think the only downside of this great cd is how short it is because after you listen to it a few times you know every single song, there are only 11. This cd definitely made me want more saves the day cds.Anyone who likes emo will like it but i think it could also appeal to people with other musical tastes."
5,Saves the Day brings music to a new level,I have all there cd's.....and by far this is there most intense one yet. They pour out so much emotion into there songs and there words give me the chills. I have never in my life heard such wonderful music. The only complaint I have is that there are no acoustics but I guess that is so because of there previous record which is all acoustic. I definetly recommend that u buy this cd. It is worth every penny.
5,saves the day is soooooo awesome,"I cannot express in words how much I love this cd. Just picture the happiest, fullest, most bittersweet day of your life and that is ""Stay What You Are."" The music is pure emotion, energy, and beauty. It sounds odd to describe punkrock in this manner but that is the way that it is. Every single song on this cd is awesome. In particular, my favorites are ""See You,"" ""Cars & Calories"" ""Certain Tragedy"" ""All I'm Losing Is Me"" ""As Your Ghost Takes Flight"" ""This Is Not An Exit."" In short, basically everysingle one. Later I'll be kicking myself for not mentioning the rest, so just direct your attention to the list of songs on this cd and then you'll see the best ones - all of them. I am totally serious. It is very rare that I get so attached to a cd like this but this cd is THE BEST. I love Saves the Day, this record won me over, and I am SUCH a softy for them now."
4,good music and they don't sellout doing it,i recomend this cd.good songs.strong lyrics.all original.great stuff.
2,Saves the Day - Stay What You Are,"Fans of songs sung with emotion would be well advised to steer clear of this.I bought this CD on the basis of a few songs I had heard from their previous albums, and I would recommend those over this, their last offering. The songs lack emotion and are bland. Lyrics seem to be regurgitated from tracks you have just heard, and this makes for a boring listening experience. Perhaps if they had mixed things around a bit, and tried to push on from music that had gone before, this would have been more enjoyable.On the whole, I give it two stars for two tracks: All I'm Losing is Me and Jukebox Breakdown."
1,Quirky and Unreliable,This is an amusing toy when you have excellent line of sight connectivity but it is not practical for any sort of serious use. Even in ideal circumstances the screen often just goes blank.The configuration utility did not run properly on my computer (new) so I had to configure it manually which would have been unpleasant for someone not knowledgable about computers.
2,"Poor picture, useless","I bought this item, then returned it.The picture is terrible. They must have used 10 year old camera technology and hooked it to an 802.11 wireless system.Also, something very important to note ... the view area is very narrow. Look through an empty papertowel roll. That is about the field of view through this camera. You can't even monitor a whole room with this.Useless."
4,It actually works and that's a surprise,"With a long history of many failed attempts at IP wireless cams, Linksys creates what others could not; one that works.Configuration with WEP was pretty easy. It's a little temperamental with distance compared to the tolerances of other G devices, but it works. It does not react well to low light levels and tries to compensate via its own gain. If you are using this in a home without AMPLE light, expect a grainy picture.Frame rate is about 20FPS and is annoying. The security feature works. It senses movement and mails a captured video file. With only 4 seconds at the medium setting, the video images were over 500Kb. This is not for a dial-up AOL user.There is a remote viewing option that lets you use their web servers to hit your cam from anywhere. Of course expect to pay about $40 for two years access."
3,Microphone works only for 2 weeks.,"I have had this camera for the last 4 months (well in reality 3 different cameras). The camera has its positives and negativesPositive:I can view my baby from work, which by itself makes it priceless.The picture quality is better than I expected.The Viewer utility lets me record images and take snapshot.Negative:The microphone stops working within few weeks. I have gone and exchanged 3 times. The camera's microphone works great for 2 weeks and then after that just hear a constant buzzing sound. I have sent Linksys multiple emails regarding the matter, but no answer. I would appreciate if anybody out there has a resolution for this.I also did subsrcibe to the Sololink service. The website is extremely slow. Luckily I was able to configure the viewer utility on my work computer.Setup directions and Linksys helpdesk could be a lot bette"
1,No stars really,"Camera cannot color balance, Linksys support blows, three hours on the phone with them they are clueless on how to really make the sololink DDNS srvice work, this item is a Bad choice for web cams, it also does not support regular codecs for usage on web cam fourms, systems etc.. its mainly point to point and only allows 4 users at a time to view.. I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS ITEM AND ITS BEING RETURNED TO AMAZON"
1,Not worth it,"I bought this so I could keep an eye on my home while I travel for long periods of time. Right now I am completely frustrated as this is Day #2 away from home and the camera suddenly does not work anymore.It was a pain to set up, tech support call center is located somewhere outside the US (I should have known then that this camera would be a problem) and it was really difficult to understand accents both times I called...and I work with people with accents all day long as an ESL teacher!!!Don't buy it...wait until they make a better camera as this one is not worth the price."
2,Won't connect over WPA,"I've had this camera replaced by Linksys 4 times. The first time, was due to the camera crashing on a weekly basis. The second replacement worked fine until I upgraded my router and switched from WEP to WPA. After the switch the camera would not connect to the router, switching back to WEP, of course worked. Linksys has replaced the camera 3 times for this issue, and with the last support call confirmed that there is a KNOWN problem with WPA encryption and this camera."
2,Not Impressed with the new version.,"I've had the older version (11B) for over a year and have never had a problem. I bought the new one (54G) a month ago and have been unable to connect via the Internet. I've emailed Linksys support multiple times and they don't even respond. And just this week the built in mic stopped working. All I hear is static. I love the linksys wireless products and have spent a lot of money with them. I can only hope this is just a fluke and that Linksys will pony up to not only replacing mine, but fixing this problem for everyone."
2,wvc54g,"Poor reliability, firmware obsolete,motion detection doesnot work. Have had to return 2 of 4 cameras ans still have one that lost its RF connection with the router."
3,Not easy to get the wireless working,"As a software engineer, I have installed and configured numerous wireless routers and adaptors. Not so easy with this camera...Actually, I gave up on it.Setting these carmeras up as wired was straightforward - they work out of the box. If you want to monitor multiple cameras simultaneously, you need to install the Linksys software that does that. Linksys technician gave me the ftp site URL to download it.All in all, sufficient for non-commercial use, but not for business use."
3,Not quite complete,"The Freedom Call/Holy Live CD might seem like a better deal than buying the discs individually, but it is worth noting that you're not getting the full Freedom Call EP on this release. It does not contain the three live acoustic tracks that the regular Freedom Call disc features. If you're a die-hard Angra fan, you're better off buying Freedom Call and Holy Live separately."
1,Robinair,"I orderd this item to fix my AC,the item was suposed to be 50Lb but when i got it it was 27.5Lb, so when you ordering this item contact the seller first,the fact is I'm not trusting them and I'm not a happy campers."
4,Good wall brackets!!,I had someone installed them for me so not sure how it went but they look good and they do the job.
1,Bose WB3 Wall Brackets,"Returned the units for refund as speakers could not be mounted in space originally planned. Return policy and refund was immediate and without any complications. Speaker stands were ordered as replacements, and worked very well."
5,great to revitalize your puffy down,"Worked great (even in my high efficency washer and dryer), made my green down puffer look like new again (had some staining from coffee and salt and other randomness on it). It looked almost like new once washed and performed as well as it allways had. Now normally I would just wear the jacket dirty but the wife was absolutely insistent that I get it cleaned or it gets thrown away and it did the job to preserve my favorite winter coat."
4,Makes down very clean but waterproofing is so-so,"Had the waterproofing been better, I'd have given it 5 stars. As it turns out, the waterproofing is only mild."
4,Seems to work,"Took a star off because the Down Proof component of this seemed to leave a bit of tackiness on the interior of the coat, which makes sense because the DWR chemicals are being swished around the entire coat. The spray on DWR is going to leave you more satisfied. The down wash on the other hand worked well. I didn't lose any loft and I got the rest of the fabrics on the coat nice and clean."
2,Down Wash,I didn't see any difference with this item or using regular detergent. Very disappointing.... Probably would not recommend this to anyone
3,Nice strap...Needs to be replaced,"I love and hate my RS800pte. The data it collects is great and the software, though it has a learning curve, is also very good. The main problem w/ this unit and the HR strap is how finicky it is. I've had to send my watch back 3x in the two years I've owned it. I've had to send back the speed sensors (from both bikes) and now the HR strap needs to be replaced.Polar just informed me that it is important to remove the HR receiver unit from the strap after every single use so that it can dry out. Other wise corrosion will build up at the snaps and no longer be able to make a clean connection. This is most likely why so many people complain about the lack of longevity with this strap. Why Polar is not more pro-active by, for example, sticking a peel-able tag on the strap informing their new customers to be diligent about this is beyond me and could have saved many customers some $$$!!!"
1,Bad service,I ordered what was supposed to be a Polar transmitter and band. What arrived was only the band. My order couldn't be fulfilled so I never got the transmitter. I had to buy it from another of Amazon's retailers. I was very disappointed due to the fact I had to pay more for the one I received. Amazon was apologetic and gave me a refund and $5 credit.
2,Strap its too short,"the strap says that its good to 60"" it's VERY VERY tight all of the way out. I wear an XL Jersey on 99 % of my Jersey's (as I don't know what size my chest is this will give others fare warning about the size so now I have to spend another $27 for the XXXL strap thanks Polar."
4,Cool,This is a cute farm set. My daughter received this from her grandparent's (who live on a farm) for Christmas. She hasn't really gotten into yet. She is more into baby dolls. My husband seems to enjoy it though! The sounds are cute and I think it is a fun toy.
5,Fun as advertised,"I got this toy for my younger boy when he was about 8 months old. He couldn't get near it for a couple of months because my three-year old was always playing with it. But, starting around ten months old, he took a big interest in it and still at 14 months it's one of the toys he always goes back to. The animal sounds and song are cute, not too loud or annoying for parents. The characters are great. This is truly a perfect toy for a one-year old."
4,Animal Farm,"My son received this gift for his first birthday, & I think he was a little too young for it then because he rarely played with it. Now that he's alomst 2, and his imagination is starting to kick in, he plays with it almost daily. We often bring other small toys over to the farm and have parties. This toy has also helped him learn his animal noises. The one drawback I have about the toy is that when it plays the song, ""Old MacDonald,"" you can't ""plug in"" an animal noise (""and a 'moo-moo' here"") or the music stops all together. A great buy though!!!"
5,Best Toy Ever!,This is the best toy that we have ever gotten for our two boys. They have been playing with it everyday for two years. They love it!
4,Wasn't this item recently recalled?,"My son has this farm and loves it, but I recently found out it was recalled....."
2,overpriced and overrated,"The Little People Animal Sounds Farm toy is overrated and overpriced. I believe the best toy is the simplest toy that doesn't require too much assembling time. The animal sounds are muffled, e.g., the pig and the cow. These animals don't do much except staying in the same area. In addition, it requires screw driver and batteries. I would rather spend my money in purchasing coloring activity books. I would prefer purchasing a toy that actually enhances my child's developmental skill which I don't believe this toy has. It couldn't keep my two-year-old daughter attention longer than five minutes. For the number of pieces and quality of the product, it should be priced no more than $20. How much does a chip cost anyway?"
5,Great Farm Set for All Ages!,"We bought this farm set for our son, 11 months at the time, for Christmas. Our 22 month old daughter fell in love with it just as quickly!1. Good size- enough room to easily maneuver animals in and out.2. Love that the top of the silo opens kind of like a secret door.3. Nice sounds4. Comes with a nice assortment of animalsWe bought some additional animals to go with this set and both our children love to use them with the farm even though they don't ""go with"" the original set.Also, our 7 year old nephew enjoys playing with this when he's over as well as children of various ages who have been over for play dates."
4,Everyone Loves the Little People Farm!,"My one-year old was given the Little People Farm for her 1st birthday. She is learning how to play with it and seems to enjoy discovering the different areas of the farm building. The farm is interesting because it makes noises that reward her for pushing buttons or closing doors (animal noises or Farmer Dan's snoring, etc.). She is memorizing animal names by using (and chewing on) the plastic animals. Her manual dexterity has improved by twisting the merry-go-round, opening the silo hatch, and clipping/unclipping the fences. The interesting thing is that my four-year old is enjoying this toy, too! He puts his HotWheels cars in with the animals, and the two siblings play together. It seems to be a real kid magnet, because visiting kids can't seem to stay away from this toy. It is easy to put together (putting on stickers and inserting 2 screws) and very durable. Great value for the money and a real crowd pleaser!"
4,Big Fun for Little People,I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. She has learned to identify all of the animals and sounds and loves placing them in the merry go round and spinning them around. She also loves dancing to the music. A great toy that will be used for years to come.
5,Still using it!,My kids are 3 1/2 and 5 and they still play with this toy. There aren't many that I can say that about. Definately worth the money.
5,MOOOOOO,"I remember having this toy as a kid-unfortunately at the time I did, all mine farm did was go ""MOOO"" when you opened the barn door-and my Little People were made out of wood and were bald.I still had a blast with it for many years despite. When I saw the latest version I HAD to get it for my kids-they absolutely love it-I bought it over 3 years ago and to this day they both still play with it-good ole' Little People. No kid should be without. Very durable and safe for even the tiniest of hands-no worries about putting small pieces in their mouths either."
2,Moves Too FAST!!!!!!!!,My daughter couldn't wait to get this for her birthday. What a disappointment!!! This moves soooooo fast J-Lo couldn't keep up with it. You have two DJ's yelling moves at you fast as heck at the same time. There is no way possible to keep up with this. The only benefit I did find is that if your looking for a way to make your kids get up and move and get exercise than this is definetly the game for you.
4,A lot of fun!,"We bought this for my daughter's birthday party. There were from playing it and they had a blast. It does move pretty fast, and that is the only thing that discouraged them. Teens could probably keep up more easily. It is a very fast-paced, high energy activity, and I think we will get a lot of use out of it over the next few years. I am glad we bought it."
4,Inexpensive alternative to DDR...,"If you don't want to pay the money for a DDR and all the stuff you need to run it, this is a much more budget-friendly alternative. Also, unlike a DDR, you can use this game just about anywhere--as you get used to the general positions, you can even play without the mats, if you put the music on your iPod or other player.I noticed a lot of the reviewers here commenting on how difficult the moves are. Well, you do want the difficulty level of something like this to increase so you don't get bored. Also, you *can* play it without the competitive aspect, just to get some exercise, and lots of laughs as you and others do (or try to do) the moves.Good value for money, especially if you can get it used here on Amazon."
3,Nice Toy,"This toy was fun, but very hard to play with. It seems like all you do is put out the mats, put in the cd, and dance on your own. That's not all. It is very fast-paced and hard to hear what the people are saying. It says reccomended for ages 7 up, but I'd say ages 12 up."
1,Uhhh,I had never played this game until at my friends house.. This game is not fun at all. It has no purpose to it and is boring.. That is what I think!! :-(
2,wow..............,"Ok, i really wanted this game for X mas. On tv they made it look so fun!!! My mom got it for me, and it was so lame!!! I mean, those dumb djs are so annoying! Its not that easy, so if you want a pretty junky challenge, go for it!!! I didnt like it at all! The only thing that is fun is the freestyle mode, where u get to make up your own moves and stuff. I wouldnt suggest this game, i thought it was dumb. dont buy it before you know u really really want it!"
2,Tough For Young Ones,I only got this game because it gave me a ticket to go to this autograph signing I wanted to go to and I just decided to finally try it out. I'm a dancer and I found this tough. It goes too fast for even me and I didn't find that very fun. And I also had a hard time with figuring out who's voice was talking because to me they sounded the same. This is one of those games you can either do it or you can't and you won't know until you try. But I really don't think younger children will be able to do it. I know a lot of kids who would get very discouraged by this. Personally the original version is much better. I could barely get through the first CD. I had to keep playing each song at least 4 times until I got it.
1,Not worth it!,"The djs sound the same so it gets confusing, really confusing when you cant understand what the heck there saying!!"
2,Uh uh,"This is the worst game ever. Right when i got it was soooo hard. The first 2 songs are pretty easy but it gets fast and faster and faster. it get more confusng as you go along. You get all mixed up. so i'm telling you this now, don't waste your money on this stupid, not fun at all toy. But if you want to......."
2,don't bother,"I bought this for my 10 year old daughter for christmas after she begged for it. Needless to say, I played it with her and her 6 year old brother for the first time and even I couldn't keep up with the moves. The dj's sound too much alike, they give the orders too fast, it just isn't that much fun. I asked my daughter to take it to a family christmas a day or two after christmas to play with her cousins and she wouldn't!! she is not excited about this game at all and I can't even get her to play it. It seems to be a fairly durable game but we will probably not use it enough to find out. I will be giving her the option to take it back for another toy of her choice, what a disapointment! I hate giving my kids toys that disappoint them, it takes all of the fun out of Christmas break and being able to play with all of your cool toys."
1,Terrible show!!,"I watched the first 2 episodes and the graphics of the pre-historic creatures are horrific and the story line itself is quite cheesy. I only tried to watch it because the show gets high rating by a lot of people. Just goes to show me how many people have terrible taste in television shows. Sons of Anarchy, Dexter, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, and Damages are much better shows than this!!"
4,Decent low rent sci fi,"The plot concept is interesting. The acting is great. The only bad actor is the bad guy. (SPOILER ALERT) I am lead to speculate that maybe there were personality conflicts, so they played rock, paper, scissors to decide on who to cut. With a cast this strong, I can't believe they have such a tendency to kill main characters. The writing is mediocre, but is carried off really well. The suspense is well done. Everytime I watch one of these episodes, I swear I'm never going to watch another one because they ticked me off so much getting rid of character a, b, or c, but they keep me coming back and watching. Go ahead, grab the popcorn, and watch all of them. It's really worth it over all."
5,GREAT!!,"This is a great show. Love, Love, Love it. Can not wait for the next season to stream. Keeps you on the edge of your seat."
3,Cheesy special effects,I had high hopes for this show but the special effects are cheesy and the characters and their reactions to dangerous situations are just not believable.
4,BBC's Primeval Amazes!,"Despite an ""out there"" premise, the series delivers believable SFX, interesting scripts, above average (for a TV series) acting, and more than a few edge-of-the-seat surprises."
1,Mindless Cheese + Poor FX,"The story is just lame, action sequences are unbelievable, dialogue is unimaginative, and the special effects are very poorly blended into the video footage. I can't recommend this to anyone, you're better of watching Doctor Who, or going out for a walk."
4,love sci fi,"My son is 6 and saw a preview for this. He happily earned ""happy points"" so we would purchase this for him. It is a great pick, the whole family has enjoyed it---we can't wait for the next season to come out on dvd as it is still airing on BBC. My daughter is 3 and most episodes are not too scary for her."
2,"Very silly, Idiot plot","I purchased this being a huge fan of ""Dr. Who"" and ""Torchwood."" With that in mind, I have to say that ""Primeval"" is really silly and idiotic. I love science fiction and science fantasy, but the writing here is really pitiful. The basic idea of the series is great, and the acting is passable. HOWEVER, ""Primeval"" has what Roger Ebert calls an ""idiot plot"" - the show would end in 5 minutes if the characters had the common sense that any viewer has. The story just goes on because the characters make one foolish, unrealistic mistake after another. It was really disappointing and I'm surprised at the overall high reviews this series is getting. I found myself getting annoyed and bored with it most of the time. I should have saved my money and bought another season of ""Dr. Who"" or ""Torchwood."" Having watched a few more episodes I can say confidently THIS PROGRAM IS TERRIBLE. ONE STAR IS TOO GENEROUS."
4,"Primeval: If you liked Jurassic Park, you will like this series!","If Jurassic Park was down your alley, you will like this BBC series. The focus of the series are so-called ""anomalies"" which randomly seem to occur around the London area. A team of scientist explores, and often contains, the various creatures that emerge from those anomalies. This series is fun to watch, although at times the storylines are redundant."
3,"Series 1... pretty good, Series 2... pretty awful",Series 1 presents the characters and each encounter with a new beast is a very interesting adventure.Series 2 becomes a melodramatic soap opera / conspiracy thriller with prehistoric beasts in the background.Maybe that's why they haven't made series 3
1,Dumb,"Its a soap opera with monsters. Duh. And does anyone know the difference between seasons 1 and 2, and series 1 and 2?"
5,A Whole New Me,"The book, ""In The Meantime, Finding Yourself and the Love That You Want"" is the most beautiful thing that has happened to me in my life. This is because it helped me to find out who I was again. After dealing with life's lessons that God gave me. It's been tough, but, this book taught me a lot. It also taught me how to love everyone including myself. Not everyone realizes they need to actually ""love"" themselves. I did and after a year of loving myself and being ""by myself,"" I found a new best friend/boyfriend to share all of that love with.If you want to renew your heart and soul, I highly recommend this book. Just like I do when I hear of anyone having a hard time in life."
3,Confused and confusing,"I found this book confused and confusing. On the one hand, we're told if we trust and have patience, love will come. And later, we're told - NO guarantees! And the Jeri-Willy couple who had been together for 32 years with grown up children.... who a few pages later turn out to be one person aged 32, ahem right (what happened those children! ). The book had its moments though."
2,nowhere to write label!,"I can't vouch for the quality of the media just yet. I've only burned a couple so far.However, one gripe I do have about these dvd-r disks is that the top side of every disk is entirely covered with text and an image of some dude listening to music (the image is similar to the image seen on the disk in the Amazon photo) The image is very dark, has a dark-gray background and doesn't leave any area for you to write a legible label on the disk with a sharpie.Regardless of how well they may work, I probably wouldn't buy these again."
2,Definitely a required item.,"Bose 901's have a very odd response curve, and the active equalizer is a specialized preamp of sorts to smooth out the sound and emphasize the low and top end. For some strange reason Bose hasn't gone digital with this preamp. Its 100% analog. A pre-out loop needs to be available on your amp before you can set it up properly. The amp also should be a plain stereo amp, since the equalizer shapes the sound so much that if you connect a 2nd set of speakers (b-channel) they will sound very harsh and could even damage them.You get 2 slides, mid-bass and mid-treble. There's also a low bass cutoff button, and not much else.The unit is rather large for what it does, and is an odd size that takes up more room in your stereo cabinet than it should."
3,"Faulty construction (the book, not the buildings)","This book includes many semi-opaque illustrated papers that are pasted or taped to the bound pages. It's a nice idea, but the paste and/or tape in my copy arrived dried out so that the inserts are loose, and the acids or oils in the glue seeped through the paper so the inserts are also blemished. I'm assuming this was a design flaw, and did not just affect my copy. Did anyone else have this problem? Aside from this disappointment, this is a pleasant and attractively laid out picture book of one architect's expensive new dwellings using classical idioms. In my opinion, best suited for fans of the types of showplaces that are favored by Architectural Digest."
1,Unusable,"Although the designs are full page illustrations, the areas to be colored are incredibly small. They would be challenging for an adult. Don't even consider using them with children."
4,Fun book to color,Fun book for little kids to color and learn something. I got this book for my nieces and they like it.
4,Review:,"Mexican Folk Art Coloring Book is a great coloring book to show examples of the Day of the Dead activities and motifs. Most of the pages are a little complicated for younger children but this book would work great for upper elementary school children, middle school, high school, and adults."
2,Hmmm,"I thought the cover looked really cool and that there would be more sugar skull coloring pages, but I was wrong. There was only one sugar skull."
5,coloring for adults,"""Get out your crayons and your pencils"" This is mommy's coloring book-something every mom should have. The intricate line drawings offer hours of coloring that produce very framable finished works. This is great for plane trips, hospital visits, or just plain procrastination. Next time your boss calls say your are coloring and mean it. I recommend fine tip markers or quality colored pencils."
5,History of the Doncaster-Box Hill Tramway,"""The First Electric Road"" is a short history of the electric tramway which ran between Doncaster and Box Hill between 1889 and 1895. (Doncaster and Box Hill are now part of suburban Melbourne, Australia). This was the first electric tramway in the southern hemisphere. The book is well written and researched. It is liberally illustrated with photograpghs and contains several maps. The book is an essential item for anyone who is interested in the tramways of the greatest tramway city in the English speaking world.The book is available from the author at 730 Hawthorn Road, East Brighton, Victoria, Australia"
2,Eh...,"There was soooo much hype around the release of Willa's debut single ""I Wanna Be Bad"". It was a hit, but not as huge as I think the hype made it sound. I like the song, and I figured I would give Willa a chance. ... I give Willa props for writing most of the songs on the CD... but the production is just lacking. ""I Wanna Be Bad"" is by far the best song on this CD. Willa has a lot of potential, but her true talent is just not shown on this CD. Hopefully she will get some better production on future efforts and find a producer that clicks with what she is trying to do. I got respect for Willa, but this just doesn't cut it. I know she can do better."
4,Willa surprised me!,"Ok at first I said I would not support this girl, cuz we all know she got her deal b/c of Nick....But I wanna be bad was a hot song so I got the album and its actually pretty good...she ain't no Christina .. but shes still kool. Some parts are really corny...like the stupid rap in Prince Charming, the whole Tired song (she's just contradicting herself).... the beats all sound the same.. but she's got some catchy songs. She sings a bit off key on a few songs but overall the album isnt too bad...if you are a fan of britney or christina..you'll love it..but if you are looking for something different...this aint it"
2,"Willa, the jokes on you!","In an interview Willa said that she write her own lyrics and co-produced the entire cd. She also said that this was a good party cd filled with upbeat tracks that you don't have to skip. I was impressed that she wasn't like other teen stars so I bought the cd. All I can say is that Willa must go to some boring parties because most of the songs on this cd are medium tempo so you can't dance to them. The lyrics are nothing to be proud of either. She may not have written about typical pop topics, instead she wrote about wanting to get laid, etc. I wouldn't know if she had a good voice or not, because her songs were so overproduced that they drowned out her singing. This cd is definitely not for me. For good music try buying cds by alicia keys, michelle branch, krystal, and nelly furtado."
1,Just plain bad.,"I only gave Willa's debut effort 1 star because I like the song ""I Wanna Be Bad"". The rest of this CD however, is terrible. I can't for the life of me figure out how she got a record deal. Bad. Bad. Bad. Willa, you most certainly are."
4,NOT BAD--NOT BAD AT ALL!!,"I got turned on to Willa Ford with her song I Wanta Be Bad on the 7-Up commercial. I liked that song--which didn't get much radio play up here in the sticks--and so I went looking for the CD. I was surprised to read the harsh reviews on Amazon and elsewhere. The clips of the songs didn't sound that bad--certainly not offensive, so I bought a copy (and got it cheap).Giving the whole thing a fair listen (actually I played mine 3 times in a row) I've got to say now this isn't at all bad and in fact really pretty good. Although there isn't really any other song that measures up to I Wanta be Bad, the others arent poor and the Cd as a whole sounded alright to me.So, if you are like me--looking more for something that is fun and enjoyable to listen more than resistant to dismanteling by more difficult moods--Willa Ford's CD Willa Was Here May be OK for you too."
2,Well..it could be worse,"Okay so Willa Ford got fAmous not for her ""wonderful"" singing and her ""great"" songs. She got famous because she slept with a backstreet boy. If it wasn't for Nick, she wouldn't be famous. She keeps saying she doesn't want to be compared to britney or christina but in all truth, there's nothing to compare. Christina can actually sing and britney.. well britnay got famous for her catholic school girl outift in baby one more time. This cd could be better if Willa didn't sound like she was trying so hard. I did like this cd. I wanna be bad and ooh ooh and wish were the only decent songs on this album. the other songs were okay but hardly worth repeating. not to mention the fact that willa cant sing."
2,Don't Try This At Home,"This album is in a word..HORRIBLE. Considering how catchy ""I Wanna Be Bad"" was I thought this album might actually be good. I was wrong. This album is full of ""trying to be different"" songs. Willa claims shes so different from Britney and the rest yet shes singing about ""love"" ""prince charmings"" and ""being bad"" just like all the other popsters. One good thing about her is that she has a pretty good voice. The beats on the album were also nice. The lyrics were poor and the vocal arrangements were sour. If I were her I'd stop telling people I wrote and executive produced my album because that's exactly what it sounds like. It sounds like you produced it in the 3rd grade in her backyard. I can see why she wasn't picked up by a major record deal. Sorry Willa..this album is one I won't be trying to sing at home..it's going in the junk/sell pile."
2,Instant replay ---,"Her voice sounds great, but is overshadowed by the same old beat, instruments, background and tone in everyone of her songs. I wanted to strangle the drummer! I would hope she doesn't need that annoying loud and heavy ""clack"" to stay on tempo (if she does, get a new job!). It sounds like every one of her songs was recorded with the exact same 3 background people and all done on the same day. If she would vary her background singers completely, vary the instruments accompaning her songs, and not use the exact same rythm in all of her songs, she would be much more appealing."
2,Next Peice of Bubblegume please,"All through this album Willa complains about bubblegum music (how dumb is that,she is singing bubblegum) and everyone trying to steal her image.She complains about Bitney.She has an ok voice.If she would stop complaining for a minute she might be able to release some ok music."
1,Willa...,"...PLEASE, do we really need anymore of this white girl pop [junk]??! She really [stinks]!!! Her single ""I Wanna Be Bad"" may have a good beat to it (hey, Britney's songs have good beats too but at least she can dance!) but honestly, she's just hypocritical. She disses pop music and its participants when she's in the pop music scene herself and she's not doing too well herself either.Please don't buy this album. You'll be wasting your money."
1,not good,"I expected a lot more from Willa's debut album and this is a big, big disappointment. Even the first single, I Wanna Be Bad, is just not good. She sounds just like the rest. Sheesh!"
1,Willa sucks,"Oh God, Willa Ford is terrible. Please, people, for the love of God - don't buy this CD! Willa's career needs to come to an end."
3,it was ok,"When you hear this cd you will get a deja vu feeling. Thats probably because it is very similar to Britney Spear's ""Oops I did It Again"" Album. There isn't very much creativity here, none of the songs will really stand out in your mind. The lyrics are a bit more daring than Britney's but the tunes are pure pop. It's your basic pop cd, if you like Willa's single ""I Wanna Be Bad"" you will probably like the rest of the cd. I personally wouldn't recommend it though. If anything you are better off downloading it."
2,We Already Suffer Britney!,"Two stars for that the fact that her voice is decent. The 3 taken stars are for the fact that her CD is full of ordinary, dull, Britney-wanna be music that has no reall attitude, point, or purpose. This CD is a waste of money, and frankly, I'm getting nauseated by all of the [stuff] that it passing for talent these days. And what type of person is so spoiled and self-absorbed that they whine about fame on their DEBUT ALBUM!?"
2,Can i have a refund?,"I think its time for Willa to stop bragging about writing her own music. Why? Its simple really, she is a hypocrite. First, she tries to prove she is a naughty little girl, with ""I wanna be bad."" Then, five tracks latter (""Tender""), she talks about how tender she is. Hmmm? Then, in ""Tired"", she is stupid enough to say that pop stars are manufactured! What! SHe is a pop star. Even worse, is her constant moans. Thats all she does, moan. I mean, one of her songs is entirley moaning, titled ""Ooh Ooh."" Willa, i was excited about your cd. I thought, why are there so many anti Willa fans? Well, i know now. Willa was here, and now, she can leave."
3,sounds like someone else...,"i listened to the samples and they are all good.. but it sounds like mandy moores stuff...and that jessica simpson chic..i like them too..but this willa ford is just another white girl trying to sing black, which is cool...but it all sounds the same..might as well just buy mandy moore..."
1,"Willa Is Bad - As In ""Not Good""","Ms. ""Ford"" claims to have studied opera. One would suppose that she had an outstanding singing voice. She does not. Or if she does, you could never tell by listening to this. Perhaps she should stop trying so hard to be the ultimate Pop Tart and record something that does not bury her in unoriginal production. Maybe this CD would have been recorded even if she had not been you-know-who's girlfriend, but I doubt it. Better luck next time."
1,I actually have respect for Britney now...,"Sad, but true. This album is the worst one I've ever heard in my 12 years of life! She doesn't have good vocals like Christina or Jessica, and she can't do anything original like Mandy Moore. Willa thinks she's trying to differentiate herself from others, but the last time I heard it it sounds just like every other stupid teen pop act out there, only worse! This CD only contradicts Willa herself. First she says she doesn't need a guy in ""Did Ya Understand That"" and ""Jokes On You"", and then saying how she wants love in ""Tender"" and ""Prince Charming"". Then she disses Britney in ""Tired"", and later says that they're good friends. And the video for ""I Wanna Be Bad"" is just as stupid and annoying as the song itself. Plus, she's dissed many artists. Britney Spears, Howie Dorough, Jessica Simpson, Pink, *NSYNC and the list goes on. ...."
1,she is cheesy,she can never be compared to christina aguilera soulful vocal skills.......and britney hot dance moves or mariah carey vocal range OR MADONNA reinventive styles aboutbeing hornyIS VERY GENERIC... and another song where she shout (matt damon where you at...leo dicapio where you at is cheesy) dont buy it there are only two decent songs
1,Nothing New,"This CD is nothing the average pop fan hasn't heard. The only difference is that, rather than going to a professional songwriter, Willa Ford wrote her own cheesy pop lyrics.Her voice is nothing to jump about; she can barely handle her own simple melodies. And when she blatantly goes off-pitch in Joke's On You and Dare, you can do nothing but laugh.And in Tired, the self-glorifying egomaniac's theme song, the line ""One hit wonder melodies who cannot sing a note,"" seems to be more autobiographical than anything else. Lets hope the title is prophetic, and that Willa will be a thing of the past REAL soon."
4,Willa rocks!,"Whoever Rickey Wright is, is totally and utterly wrong. What kind of music do they listen to??? Willa Was Here is a great CD, perfect for jammin at parties or even for study breaks. Sure she's blonde and sings pop. So what?! She's just tryin to make it out there in the crazy hollywood world and pursue her dream. Can you blame her for that?"
3,It's Okay ...,"Willa Ford's album is a little more angst-driven than most female pop vocalists' albums. But her voice is not as smooth or bearable. She has much more of an urban sound - sometimes you can even hear some of her ""ghetto accent"" shine through.Only about half the songs are considerably good. ""Tired"" is a really annoying song because it seems that the only reason she sings it at all is to prove that she's not like all the Britneys out there. And I don't think her singing it proves anything. ""Dare"" is also an annoying song, with her repeating ""nasty lady"" over and over and over again.The best songs on her album would have to be ""I Wanna Be Bad"", ""Did Ya Understand That"", ""Tender"", and though the lyrics are cryptic and even humorously random, ""Don't You Wish"".I'd recommend this album to someone who wants something a little more urban and raw, though not by much. Make sure you can stand redundant lyrics and, at times, whining."
3,Not the Best,"This album is not bad if you enjoy up beat pop tunes and mostly listen to the music and not the vocals. Lyrically, this album is seriously lacking. Many of the tracks are severly repetative and are devoid of any variety. It's not bad to pop in and sort of dance too, but it's definitely nothing for Ms. Ford to be bragging about. She's already released her best single (I Wanna Be Bad). I don't see great success for any of the other similar singles on this cd. I would recommend avoiding this album and purchasing albums by great artists who fuse variety and talent, such as, Tonya Mitchell or Krystal Harris. My advice, buy at your own risk!"
3,Not Another One,"Well, I can tell you that there's nothing new or original to this album. It's the same stuff that other pop artists have been putting out. Beat wise, and lyric wise, most of the songs are good. But Willa's voice isn't that great which ruins the songs that could be good. I mean, if you'd notice in her song, Ooh, Ooh, when she tries to hit that Mariah Carey high note, there's a pause then she picks it up again. Songs like Tender is just plain awful. That's all I can say. Willa is definitely not here. She'd do much better in a group."
4,Britney 4,"I like this CD. Catchy little tunes and shes cute of course. I think that Dont you Wish is my fave. The background vox remind me of a Tim Burton movie. I hate it when she raps on the Prince Charming song. White girls just dont sound right rapping. She may as well rap ""Im trying to be trendy, I know it sounds so cheesy"".Its funny all these pop chickas whine about Britney comparisons while their producers try to duplicate her sound. I wouldnt go playing galloping guitar riffs and then whine when people say it sounds like Metallica. If you make an effort to sound like someone, you will probably get compared to them. Hello!Anywho...I like this little Britney tribute."
5,Willa Ford - Willa was Here,"I really like the CD. My favorite tune on it is ""I wanna be bad"". I love that song. If I were you you, I would get the CD immediatly if you haven't already."
1,one of the worst cd's i have ever listened to,I am sorry Willa fans but after listening to her album and first single I have to say this is one of the worst albums I have ever heard in my 21 yrs on this earth. She has such a wannabe sound. She is just another christina aguilera/ pop princess wannabe. Maybe if she dressed more appropriately and not like an L.A. corner worker and had a ton more singing lessons and learned to get her own sound maybe i would like her. I have had a chance to meet her and just let me say she wasnt the nicest person in the world at all infact she was rather rude to me and her fans that were there at the time. I gave her music and her a chance but after meeting her and seeing stuff on tv/radio/magazine i totally dislike her music and hate everything about her. Her CD and music is not worth your hard earned money or the hard earned money of the someone that bought the cd for u.
2,Willa Got What She Wanted,"I really wanted this album. I love I Wanna Be Bad. A glossy, catchy dance pop jam similiar in style to that of Britney. I was hoping the album would consist of more songs like this, but I was disappointed. I cannot for the life of me remember how any of the songs go. I can't even remember the names of the songs. She has a decent voice, but the songs are bad. They are boring and sound uninspired. Willa is trying so hard not to be like Britney or Christina. Well the only thing she accomplishes is being a bad version of the two. Nothing against Willa but I really did not enjoy this album. I'm gonna stick to Britney,Jessica,Christina,and Mandy and all of you should too. My advice, buy the single of I Wanna Be Bad."
4,"the ""bad"" girl of pop","willa ford (real name amanda williford) releases her debut ""willa was here"". you might be thinking what seperates this blond pop singer from the rest? well for 1: willa co-wrote 9 of the 11 tracks and she also co-produced the album. that's a big step in the world of pop. anyways she does well on her first try with it all. the hit single ""i wanna be bad"" starts off the album and it's a preview of what's to come. ""willa was here"" is straight forward pop/r&b but willa's clever lyrics (check out ""ooh ooh"", ""tired"", ""prince charming"", etc.) is what sometimes saves this cd from synth overload. the beats tend to get a bit generic at times but that's the only downfall. willa's voice is great (a better range that britney's) and she does those mariah screms well. for a debut, it's awesome. let's see what willa's got planned for the next. faves are: ""i wanna be bad"", ""did ya understand that"", ""ooh ooh"", ""tired"", ""joke's on you"", ""tender"", ""don't you wish"", and ""prince charming""."
1,Willa is So Bad!,"My gosh! This is the worst album- she sounds EXACTLY like Britney. She deifinitley succeeded in being bad- no wait she is horrible! So I think she should stop using guys (like Nick Carter for example) to try and become famous. It isn't working, cause no matter what she'l always be horrible."
3,It's ok,"2001 appeared to be Willa's year. She released a Top 10 hit single called ""I Wanna Be Bad"" and a decent pop album came later that July (Willa Was Here). Sadly, though, the blonde singer's release sounded too much like something Britney Spears probably ditched when making her first record, and thus kept Miss Ford on the B-list of pop stars. Her 15 minutes didn't last long, too: after having a try with ""Did Ya' Understand That"" Ford's time in the limelight came to an abrupt halt, proving she was just a flap in the pan. That's not to say the girl doesn't possess talent: she co-wrote every song on her CD. In the end, though, her CD stayed true to its name: Willa was here, but not anymore."
1,I only picked 1 star cause 0 was no an option.,"This by far the worst album i have heard in my life. She is completely unable to carry to a tune. If i were her i would be ashamed to say that i sing. This goes way beyond all the stuff i have heard about her. (Not that i don't belive it). Oh, and i forgot to mention for those of you who did not know, She could arrested of battery.Due to the fact that she abused nick carter.I belive that every one is worth knowing. EXCEPT MANADA WILLFORD.Yes, that is her real name."
2,WHAT????.,"This album is not original, willa try to be a mix of all the teenagers singers like:Britney, Christina, Mandy, and Jessica, COME ON, we are sick of all the copies of Britney, and now this, i heard the album one time, and willa had good voice but all the songs are like stolen, the first single ""I wanna be bad"" it's a copy of Baby one more time, FORD i'm sorry but you gonna have to change of style music, if not, you ""succes"" it's gonna be really short."
2,How low can it go?,"Not as sexy as Brit, lacking the vocal talent of Christina or the sweetness of Mandy, and from what we're being told Jessica's got the whole ""virgin"" thing locked up...so what's left???Willa.... If ya can't beat em...out [vamp] em !! In fact the ""bad girl"" thing is really all she's got going for her. She makes it clear that she's nothing like the other little princess' yet the music is all the same. Use the same studio voice tricks, and driving dance beats, switch the lyrics a little and we have another pop cd. I have to admit, I am a little drawn in to the [catfight] version of the pop world, so I listened to it. ARGH!!!This helps soothe any ""recession"" worries in this country, because if there are this many people willing to throw money away on this garbage........... Get the point?"
2,bad girl please,what is this? where did they get this girl from? sad to say wila is far from a bad girl.
2,"Willa - I had hope for you, and you disappinted me so","ok, I got her single back in 01 when it came out ""I wanna be bad"" but I had heard 3 or 4 of her other songs around... and I liked them for some time so I came on here listened to some sound samples I gotta say even though, I heard all those samples, they did not play enough for someone to get the true idea of the songs quality... I thought this cd had potential, I really did, after hearing it I realized I was wrong, the only songs I like are""I Wanna Be bad""""Did Ya Understand That""""Tired""""Haunted Heart""as for the rest I think they are horrible, and I don't think the sound clips acurately help, in making your decision if these r the songs that appeal to you, the most you probably won't like most of the cd... If the others do even more so than the ones I mentioned than you probably will enjoy the cd, as for me it is not what I was expecting... so I hope I helped the rest of you in making your decision."
1,Talentless Britney Wannabe,"If you want to waste your time and money, buy this CD. If you have TASTE in music, avoid it like the plague.Willa Ford has, at best, a mediocre voice, and while her fans make a big deal about the fact that she ""writes her own songs,"" they fail to mention that she only writes the LYRICS, and, frankly, they aren't very good.Ford doesn't have Christina or Jessica's talent, Mandy's sweet likability, or Britney's magnetism. Hopefully for music fans, she'll stop making ""music"" and soon!"
2,"Its cute, but be careful","I bought this book for my two 1/2 yr old. She loved all popup style books. But this book you have to be careful with. Each page had a different style of pull out, pop up. But the paper is very thin and tears easily. Not for a child to look through them selfs. Even as an adult I have to be very gentle with it."
1,Expensive and Broken,"I ordred this chain because I have a very small wrist. I had one small charm I put on this bracelet, took very good care of it, but was only able to wear it for about 10 days before the links broke."
5,A practical guide,"Alex Berzin manages to convey the essence of the Kalachakra tantra, the vows and committments, and the initiation ceremony in day-to-day language, which makes the book absolutely essential for the serious first-time initiate. The book is also a valuable asset for everybody else interested in the Tibetan tantric tradition; it takes away some of 'magical myths'and misconceptions surrounding tantra. As a practical guide to the initiation, well this it IT.This book also forms an excellent introduction to the excellent, but much more 'scholarly' and formal book 'Kalachakra Tantra, Rite of Initiation' by His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Jeffrey Hopkins."
4,Mostly complete,"I think it's great that you can pick up Angra's first two studio albums in one relatively inexpensive package, but before you buy it you should be aware that while it's true that you get both albums in full, you won't get the three bonus tracks that were included on the US version of Angel's Cry. Those tracks consisted of an alternate version of ""Evil Warning"" and remixes of ""Angels Cry"" and ""Carry On"". That's probably not a big deal to most people, but some metal fans tend to be a bit obsessive about owning all of a band's material. If you're one of those types (and I definitely fall in that category), you may want to buyHoly LandandAngels Cryseparately. The truly daring may even try tracking down the elusiveHoly Box."
3,Disc 3 includes original recordings!,"Yes, discs 1 & 2 include songs that are re-recordings ""by one or more members of the original groups,"" but the other reviewers must not have listened to disc 3 which DOES include the original recordings. In fact, the recordings on disc 3 are licensed from Sony Music, though the Argent song, ""Hold Your Head Up,"" is an edited version that was used for AM radio airplay.Among the re-recordings, the songs contributed by Gerry & the Pacemakers hold up the best, as do the contributions from The Troggs and Chad & Jeremy. Gerry Marsden's voice sounds great and the recordings are fairly close to the originals. The remainder of the songs are pleasant enough to listen to, but sound (to these ears) like cover bands rather than the originals.My *** rating is really closer to **1/2."
2,Warning- This is all new recordings by the original artists!,"Wish I would have known that. It's OK, but just doesn't sound the same."
2,Not Buying These a Second Time,They look better than they feel. There are better shoes out there if you are seeking comfort. Okay shoe.
4,"An inspired ""music inspired by"" soundtrack","I found this in a bargain bin so didn't think twice. Pleasantly surprised to discover there's not a bad song on this. Varied but a pleasant vibe throughout. As someone who still likes making mixtapes for friends, it aint easy. Kudos to album producers susan arnold and donna roth, wherever you are."
5,Corrie Ten Boom's life continues to fascinate & inspire!,"She writes with the love and forgiveness that became her trademark after suffering terrible things at the hands of the Nazi's during WWII. I never cease to be encouraged, uplifted, and inspired when reading anything that she writes-this book included. Very few could have forgiven their tormentors the way that Tante Corrie did. She did it by the grace of God and her life was all the better for it."
5,This is the biography of the pre-The Hiding Place years...,This quite-amazing book chronicles the half century of Corrie ten Boom's life before being imprisoned for helping to save Jewish people in Holland during World War II. I can't express just how profoundly this book enlightened me to the Christian way people could actually live. I haven't been around many outstanding Christians and the ten Boom family was definitely an outstanding Christian family. How blessed I am to know about them!
2,A bit boring...yawn :(,Not much going on here. We listened to the entire CD which was excrutiating. Wish I had my money back.
4,Good value,"It's not HDTV and it's not Tivo, but for 50 bucks it's great value. Easy to install and reasonable picture on an old 600MHz Dell running Win 2000."
3,Good Value,"Works on my Dell Dimension with WinXP Pro. Quality is limited to 320x240. The recording software has several bugs--don't set 2 recordings to start at the same time, even though it lets you! Be aware that the encoding is software-only, so both the card and the driver need to work in order for you to be able to record (other cards let you stream MPEG video). Oh, and don't tell the Scheduler to close WinTV when it's done recording; your file will be corrupted and unviewable. If you can get around the quirks, it's a great deal if you can get it for under $45 total cost."
2,It works... sort of,"well I guess I cant complain too much, the thing only cost about fifty bucks. the pvr software isnt the best. I havnt been able to get it to record at 640x480. my computer should be fast enough to be able to handle it but the software doesnt give the option. the remote is nice, however with this card most of the buttos are un usable. no pausing of live tv, and bad recordiang resolution make me wish I had bought a better (more $$$) model. however if all you want to do is watch tv this card would work just fine for you, that is if you dont mind mono sound. the instalation wasnt all that easy ether. the directions were for Win 95, just to give a bit of an idea. but, if you are fairly computer literate and know what an IRQ conflict is thengo for it."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be...,"In retrospect, I shouldv'e known it was to good to be true when it only cost $50. It claims the IR Blaster the kit includes is supposed to be able to send signals to a cable box (i.e. for Digital Cable) to control the input and record any channel you recieve which is the reason I bought it.The quality isn't bad at all either on the monitor or through s-video to my 27"" TV and the sound is just fine as well. Installation was very easy, the pamflet laid it all out step by step, but the IR Blaster doesn't work (at least for my box) and the set up is only partially intuitive with virtually no help from the pamflet (its what serves as the product manual).The recording is fairly easy if only slightly puzzling to figure out the first time you use it (and I consider myself pretty computer literate!).If I had to do it over again, I'd look for a different product. Perhaps one of the All-In-Wonder line even if it means replacing my video card."
2,Not recommended if you're using the RCA input,"I bought this mainly so I could hook up my game consoles to my computer in my room (due to lack of room for a TV). It was easy to install, and fairly intuitive to work, but the picture quality was pretty bad. It's grainy and there's a ghosting that takes place when something moves. I'm connecting through the RCA input with a Monster cable. In comparison, the picture quality on my TV's in my house (including the HDTV) is very good."
1,It's a nightmare,"I previously owned a ATI All-In-Wonder TV board that works with Windows 98 only. I've purchased this Happage WinTV board to use it with Win2000 or WinXP. It installs fine, but it just doesn't work well, at least not for PAL-M here in South America, which this board is supposed to support (PAL-M is pretty close to NTSC and was perfectly supported by my previous ATI board). I've tried two computers, one P4 3.0 running Win2000 and a Dell Optiflex P4D running WinXP. The problems are the same. The TV tuner doesn't retain the settings, the capture freezes, I tried their support but it just doesn't work, neither with all their attempts to solve the problem or with the latest drivers from their website. It's a true nightmare, I spent hours and hours worrying over it, and I'm happy to trash it."
3,average,"Using this for my bedroom HT. These spkrs look great but the performance is pretty ordinary. Let me just make my position clear.......... I am not saying these are bad spkrs. However, I wouldn't use this for my main HT system. The center channel spkr in particular is not suitable for a large room. The woofer material on these is probably not something great either. So why am I keeping it then? The surrounds are sleek and look great on my nightstands. The center spkr is probably the coolest looking center channel sphr in this planet. Did not wanna clutter my nightstands with big surround speakers. Yes, I could have gone for an HT system instead ........most of them come with even smaller surrounds............but I just dont like those. Bottomline, not bad but not great either. But then again, this is not my main HT so I dont care. Thanks for reading!"
2,"A good start, but not a ""classic"".","This is a good start to the series. It was pretty good for its time, and the racing segments still hold up resonably well today. However, the game is way too dated for most people to bother with. It is often referred to as a ""classic"", but it is not. The graphics seem stone age, and control is abysmal by today's standards. Only worth a look for those who want to know how this series started."
3,cool boarder,people say that 2 and 3 are better well of course they are supposed to get better not worse. I got this game when it first come out and i played it non stop for a long time. it is a great game. so dont be dissappointed because the later games are better. It is a ps1 game not ps3 game so it will fill dated.
3,derrol adams died,"this is not a review, but it is perhaps ""interesting"" for the reader to know that on February 6, 2000, derrol adams has died in Antwerp (Belgium) in the age of almost 75. mark hertoge, st denijs-westrem(belgium)"
1,never got to use it,"post office never sent my game , yet they say it arrived , i'm unhappy. i don't know if its the dealers fault or the stupid post office."
3,Not as good as it used to be changed. Changed the formula,"I bought Porter's after shave about a year ago because I was looking for an after shave with Witch Hazel, as recommended by a dermatologist. The 3.9 oz bottle I got was great. A year later I bought another bottle in the 5.0 oz size. This time, it was clearer, runnier, and didn't smell as good. It had a more mediciney smell and was about half the consistency as before. I compared the labels on the back.. Apparently Porter's has removed 2 ingredients from the 'new, improved, and cost-cutting' version. The ingredients are LAVENDER OIL and FIR NEEDLE OIL. What these ingredients really do I don't know, but I do know the product is not what it used to be and I don't see myself buying more, unless they change it back. Time to fire the Harvard MBA who wanted to do cost-cutting at the company don't you think?"
2,Randy Travis music,I bought a CD of Randy Travis not knowing that it only had 2 (two) songs on it lasting a total of 6+ minutes. It would have been nice if I had been informed of that fact before I bought it.
2,Carol's worst effort,"I always liked T'Pau. Carol Decker's voice is so sexy and the music was always very rich and poppy. This cd was a big disappointment for me. The lyrics, the music, the songwriting in general....there just isn't much substance here. Most of this cd is just throwaway material. The two best songs on the cd, in my opinion, are at the very end of the cd. ""Let It Fall"" and ""Sweet Dreams"" are vintage T'Pau songs. Something that could have been on the first cd. ""With A Little Luck"", the first song, is okay. Carol's vocals are great, but the music is a little thin. The rest of the cd is a snoozefest.If you want to get some of T'Pau's material, go for the amazing, self-titled first cd. The ""Greatest Hits"" cd is also great to have. You'll want to skip over this one though."
4,Walkabout - lightest one yet,"I purchased this walker for my mother who needed assistance after surgery. I had another one for my father, but when he passed away we donated it to the care center. This walkabout deluxe lite rollator is so light that it is easy to place into the car or trunk. It folds up great, and the seat is extremely comfortable. It rolls very smoothly, and the loop brakes are easy to operate, even my frail mother has no trouble locking them. I was disappointed that mine arrived with a pouch style basket, not the wire basket as pictured in the ad or the description. It still works great as a basket, just not as stable as a wire basket. For ease of use and comfort, I definately think this is perfect."
2,poorly manufactured,"One of the welded nuts that accepts the knob that adjusts the height of one of the handles was defective. Tried to replace the product but, as Amazon only fulfilled the order for the seller, my only choice was to return it. Amazon gave me a number to reach the seller in hopes that there was a fix or I could get a replacement. the number was not a working number. In the end, I went to a hardware store where they rethread the nut and found a bolt that would fit. A $5 fix. Other issue - the brakes do not really stop the wheels from moving."
2,oof,"It's super hard to pass in this game, or maybe there's some trick mentioned in the game manual. I got this from a friend, but without the manual =(. As it is, I can occassionally pass, but not very often.The choice of plays seems alright, but execution seems...less than what I expected when I chose the play. Not just because of an inability to pass.If I figure out the trick to passing, I'm sure this would be a good game. If I ever do, I promise to update this review."
4,A good game.,"This is a good college game for the 1997 season, but it is not as good as Gameday '97. It is better than last year's launch title, and has great gameplay. It is fast and looks good, so buy this if you are looking for a good game."
3,Not my cup of tea,"I guess I rather the later Sandro, I did not like this CD as much as his later music. However, I am and will always be a Sandro fan. He will be missed. Take your chances if you think you will like his early rocking roll songs, you waill probably like this more than I did."
3,Great until its moved,"Holds cords great. Only problem is when u try to move the bundler, the part u pull just stretched out and wouldn't go back together."
5,Does the job perfectly,"I frequently connect my computer or phone or netbook to my entertainment system. I got sick of having to reach back to connect cables, or having cables always lying around. I saw that the conference rooms at my office building use these to tie up network cables and A/V cables, and figured they were probably what I needed.So I attached a couple of these to my entertainment center, to hang cables from (when I want to connect a device, I open up the bundler, and roll out and connect the cable). They attached very easily to the entertainment center, they look alright holding up the loops of cables, and they're very easy to open/close. They do the job perfectly -- my entertainment center looks and feels neater, and it's always convenient to hook up my devices. I'm thinking of adding a couple more."
3,Semi useful.,"I was hoping these would work as 'cord clips' for 3 larger cords. They really only work well as the image suggests. Looping or hanging cords, not good for clipping. Not all that sturdy if your cords are pulling at funny angles."
5,Exceeded expectations,"These things are great. I use them to control the mess of computer cables under my desk. Used in combination with plastic ties, they work really well. I've tried reusable plastic ties before, and they were a pain. These are a dream to open and close, plus they stick and stay where you put them. The adhesive is strong, but if you yank on the bottom of the strip as instructed, it comes right off. The quality and design of the produduct far exceeded my expectations."
1,Not what I thought it was,I thought this was an electric company video but mostly it was more of a commentary on how it got started... of absolutely no interest to my children.
2,not what i thought,"I am a kindergarten teacher and I have been using the electric company videos in classroom for a couple of years for language arts. I thought that this dvd was more shows, it turned out to be more interviews than anythings else. My students love watching the shows."
3,Greatest?,"This is an interesting little documentary which could work as an introduction for those of us across the Atlantic who have never seen The Electric Company in it's natural habitat. Unfortunately it never seems to make up it's mind whether it is intended as nostalgia or as an explanation of the educational intention.The interviews with the very personable presenters are about what you'd expect for this kind of 'clips and quips' and everyone seems genuinely proud of what they made - and rightly so. Neither Bill Cosby nor Morgan Freeman appear, which seems a shame.The Electric Company's Greatest Hits and Bits is defintitely documentary-lite style programme making but is jolly viewing and well worth the low price asked."
2,should've researched it more,"Yes, as some of the others have said it is a documentary. I found it on another website and have to say that the title and descriptions I found pre-purchase were not clear about the content. Hits and Bits? More like snip-its and interviews. Now I see the ""The best of the best"" and I'm skeptical. Is their version of ""the best"" what I remember as being so awesome? I wasn't planning on dropping $35-$50 each for Volumes 1 & 2. I should've checked in with Amazon reviews first."
5,Music at last!,"I bought it for my father, who was desperately seeking it, being one of the biggest jazz collectors in Italy.I must admit that my surprise didn't come only from the fact that I finally found this cd, after searching for ages, but also by listening to it: a fantastic jazz album, but also a music masterpiece!"
2,Outdated old-school resource,"I bought this book as a backup to my classroom textbook for a Spanish class for native speakers in high school. I haven't used this one as much as ""Somos Asi en sus Marcas,"" because it is completely outdated and not a great resource."
2,So much unfulfilled promise,"This book looked to be the definitive Pro Tools tome, but falls FAR short. Some good stuff on MIDI setup and recording, but only half a page on mixing techniques? Uh, ok.Lots of diagrams of HD, MIX and other big rig setups, but who cares? Folks that own that kind of gear already know how to set up and get maximum performance from their equipment.Should have spent more time on the 002, 001, and MBox. If you own one of those systems don't waste your time with this book."
4,A Great introduction to sociology,"This book does what many full length sociology text books do not: it summarizes the sociological perspective in an intelligible and exciting manner that both novices and experts alike will find enjoyable. Bruce uses simple language and provides highly accessible examples to give the reader a quick tour of some of the basic goals and tenets of sociology. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to teach an introductory course in sociology, or anyone who wants to know what sociology is all about."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"I wanted a general knowledge of the discipline of sociology, and I got it in this book! I felt like I finished this book with an understanding of what exactly this social science is concerned with, how they go about doing their research, and some of the significant findings over the its history. It was an easy read, all things considered."
2,scattered and uninformative,"I purchased this book based on the fine coverage given to other topics in the series, Literary Criticism and Politics, and am rather disappointed with this selection. The author favors an extensive use of conversational examples, a strategy I would otherwise find appealing if not so interruptive, over any narrative or memorable structuring of the topic. The concerns of sociologists are introduced willy-nilly, and the reader might be convinced that the reason sociology is not a science per se is not that there are difficulties with experimentation and reproduciblity, but that sociologists lack a game plan entirely. If you seek a book that will help you speak about sociology with any insight, look elsewhere for something less impressionisitic."
3,A Mediocre Book,"The prose is wordy and clumsy in many places. The book lacks direction and organization. There is very little overview of research and important studies in sociology. Vague comments on modernity and industrialization overshadow what little can be found in the way of specifics. I wanted to walk away with the important names and ideas that define the discipline. Unfortunately, the book does not deliver that.Not recommended."
3,averages out to three stars,This gets three stars. The Mummy Returns is wonderful and in 2003's holy name gets FIVE STARS!! The Musketeer in the holy name of July 2005 gets a TURKEY!!
1,these watches can malfunction,I purchased this wtach for my 10 year old daughter. She did not have it for more than a week before it malfunctioned and the alarm went off in her classroom. She could not turn it off with the alram code and the school had to destroy it trying to get the batteries out. This product needs futher testing and I would not recommend its purchase for a child.
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this watch for my neice for a trip to Disney World. The watch was brand new, never been opened but it did not work properly. You could barely hear the alarm. Too bad I waited 2 months after purchasing to inspect the watches. Money wasted! A few years back I purchased one for my daughter off the Amber Watch web-site and was very pleased. Although when it was time for new batteries, it wouldn't work properly after they were installed. I made sure we purchased the correct brand and size they recommended. Great idea tho. Just needs some tweeking."
2,Avoid cheap polarizers!,"Mechanically this polarizing filter seems to be very good, easy to screw on lens, easy to rotate, feels solid and well made. However, it barely affects sky color and does not cut reflections from water surface. It still could be used as a neutral density filter thought :) And yes, I know how to use polarizer."
2,"Much, much smaller than listed as.","Darn. I would have loved this if it would have been the size listed. I returned it because it is small; probably about two inches by one and a half. I gave it two stars because I would have kept it if it would have filled the area I wanted, like the description said it would."
2,Looked great before it broke,"Really nice looking. Unfortunately, it looks like metal but is really a resin-like plastic. As long as you install it carefully on a really flat surface, it should be fine. Unfortunately, the pre-dilled holes and wires on my house were poorly placed on top of vinyl siding. Too much bounce and give. Tail snapped off right away, because the hole is so close to the edge. Okay, so thought I'd try to install with just the top screw. That put too much pressure on the top so the head popped right off. Again, if you have a really flat surface with no bounce, this should be okay. Though, if the plastic is that brittle and unforgiving, I can't imagine it would survive much cold weather."
5,The Greatest Playstation Games ever produced.,This game has its origins in the Japanese game market. It was produced only for 6 months for the us market by Sony. Why for only 6 months i don't know. It is easier to find in the NTSC/J format along with it's sequil. The premis of this game is a fast paced puzzle environment. It really tests your wits. In a way it could be described as a scrolling rubix cube game for your playstation. It even gives your mock I.Q. at the end. Hence the name Intelligent *Q*ube not Cube. Look for this game on Amazon zshops or auctions and be prepared to pay at least some money. You won't want to let this game go once you have a copy.
5,As good as i remember...,I was one of the unfortunates that got this game on a demo and couldnt find it anywhere. While i was lookin for old movies I decided what the heck and I found it! I paid [...]for my copy and its worth every penny. By far 1 of the best games on PS.
3,Awesome game,"I've looked for this game since first playing it when the PS One originally came out, though it was on a demo disc at the time.Awesome and challenging puzzle game, requires a lot of thought."
4,Very good,"This is a tool that help to get acquainted with the IFRS, that its use is becoming a requirement in more countries every day including the USA. Is detailed and provide examples on the application of the concepts."
2,What Can I say?,Ok.. never played the one before it.. but I heard it sucked.. and I bought this for $2... what can I say... I was low on funds and needed a new game ASAP! so I pick it up figure it'l be good for a few laughs tide me over till I get some cash... was that a waste of money... I mean there seems to be a plot... but it's hella hard to get to... I gave up on it pretty quick.. I got furthest when I followed no patteren and just ran around pointlessly.... in short.. It sucks left nut..
3,pretty darn good,ok this game is kinda challangeing what i like ut you do gotta use cheats and stratiges though but there are some blanks1. graphics... good barly2. difficulty settings... better than iron solder 33.gameplay... pretty cool once you get started wich take a couple tryeswell this game is a must have and must notwell i cant go futherits youre chioce
2,Expiring Date,"I bought this film October 21, 2010,the film expires Jan. 2010. If i had known this i would not have bought it"
3,advantix film,two of the three rolls were ok the third roll none of the pictures were clear maybe the film was to old
4,Group Chaos,"Prime Chaos is the first book I ever read about chaos magic. It serves as a great way to introduce a reader to the ideas and concepts of chaos magic. Despite its relatively small size it contains and highlights all the ideas a chaos mage can play with.This book is geared towards group work and a large section is dedicated to it. As a lone wolf mage you might not find it satisfying and I would suggest ""Condensed Chaos"" by the same author, Phil Hine. However if you are interested in learning and experiencing magic as a group Prime Chaos will definately be a very valuable assistant with its approach and ideas."
1,Vague Beyond Belief,"I really regreted buying this book. While I'm sure the author knows something a little more than the average joe about chaos magic, he is incredibly vague. He rambles on and on with out making a point. From reading the book, the only thing that seems clear about chaos magic is that it is whatever you make it to be. If that is truly his point, he could have shortened his book by more than 50%."
1,W.T.F.?,I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE WOULD OR COULD EQUATE THE CREATION OF THE PANTHEON OF SUMERIAN DEITIES WITH ANYONE BUT THE SUMERIANS! HOW COULD ANYONE BUT THE ENGLISH HAVE THE GAUL TO ASSERT THE BELEIF THAT LOVECRAFT ACTUALLY INVENTED KUTULU HIMSELF! THIS COULD BE VERY MISLEADING TO THOSE WHO WERE NOT AWARE OF THE SUMERIAN AND BABYLONIAN MYTHOLOGY.
4,Very helpful,This is a very helpful book I used it in my construction managment class. The book had example contracts and other documents that you will come across in the industry.
5,MG Sports Cars,"MG Sports cars , despite its rather generic title impressed me as being one of the most informative publications I've seen covering this marque. The book is especially interesting as it covers in some detail many of the earlier MG models featuring reviews and articles from the period of the respective vehicles. Particularly interesting are the cut away drawings that show the details of the workings of many of the featured cars. I think it will interest anyone who is fond of MG history."
2,"Loved the title, wish the text were as good","This book is mostly about clearing clutter, not about overcoming procrastination. There are some useful tips, but most of it is a rehash of things I've read before. Some of the content seems disorganized. There is even one full paragraph that is nothing but one cliche after another about how to motivate yourself. In fairness, the book seems to have been developed from a workshop series, and I can see how it would go well in such a setting. But if you are dealing with problems of procrastination, this book won't really help. If you are dealing with lots of clutter, you can find more and better ideas elsewhere."
5,Interesting juxtaposition of Buddhist Philosophy and Systems Principles,I had read a few books on Buddhism and a few books on Systems thinking but was not able to connect the Co-dependent Arising with Systems Thinking. This book does the connection both coherently and cogently. While the book is a difficult read I found the exposition quite enlightening and value-adding. I highly recommend the book for serious buddhist enthusiasts as well as systems thinkers.
5,Love this toy!!!,I bought this toy because I think it's adorable. My 13 month old daughter likes to lay on her tummy to look in and push all the buttons and hear the cute music and sounds. My 3 year old niece has this toy and still loves to play with it as well. Even my 4 year old nephew likes to get in on the fun sometimes. I know we will have years of fun with this toy!!
5,Perfect dollhouse for little fingers!,"The dollhouse was one of the many Little People toys we have purchased.I love Little People toys because they have details and working parts, but they are not difficult for little fingers to manipulate them.The dollhouse was especially adorable, and my daughter loved putting the baby in it's bed and playing with the little spinning mobile."
3,Rooms are too small for chubby little hands :-(,"We bought this for my 2 year old daughter and although she WANTED to play with it a lot, she had a hard time getting her tiny toddler hands in and out of those rooms. She had to have assistance and spent a lot of time frustrated with the toy. We eventually sold it and bought a large--now out of production--dollhouse and she's much happier.The other Little People toys are great, but this one needs some improvements."
5,Imagination!!!,We bought this for our daughter at Christmas 2003...now 21mo. And so much fun to watch her play and entertain herself with this. We didn't put the stickers on...figured she would peel them off!!! She loves her doll house and very much suggest buying one to everyone!!! I am sure we will have this for a very long time!!!
1,Amelia's Grandmamma,"I just ordered the world of little people sweet sounds from amazon. I haven't received it yet. I paid $200.00 for it. Now I can see it's selling for $139.00. I've also seen it for $32.00. What's going on. Is there a difference in sets? I'm not sure, but I think I acted too quickly. Can anyone tell me if there is a difference in the doll houses? Did I make a big mistake?"
5,Love It!,My daughters absolutley love this little doll house. My 3 1/2 year old will play with it for a very long time. My 21 month old also enjoys moving the little people in and out the door and making the phone &quot;ring&quot; and the other sounds go. All the Little People toys have been a big hit in our house.
5,My daughter loves it,"She is 15 months old and recently received this toy as a gift. I love watching her make everyone ""sit"" together at the table. She also loves to make the ""Mama"" noise. It's actually funny to watch he get so defensive when her 3 year old brother tries to come near her family. She has only has this toy 2 weeks and has played with it every day. I plan to add some more pieces as she gets older."
1,Cheaper somewhere else,"I just recieved a Fisher Price magazine in the mail and thought this product would be a nice Christmas gift. I was thinking that Amazon would have a good price, but they are almost double what Fisher price is asking. If you go to Fisher Price's website this item is only $33.00 + $7.95 shipping and handling."
2,Do not waste your money!,"This toy barely gets used in our house. It has a very low to the floor design, my 18 month old daughter has to hunch just to play with it. The sounds and characters are cute, but clunky and not very realistic. I am very dissatisfied with this purchase, not worth the investment. If you are looking for a fisher price doll house for your youngster, I would suggest checking out: Fisher Price - My First Dollhouse. It has a higher design with more realistic characters, not so clunky. I wish we would have purchased this one instead."
3,slightly disappointed,"This doll house is great for a 1 yr old. The idea works for the most part. However, after owning one and then reading the reviews, I think my confusion has been eliminated. That, or my version only works partially. The computer appears to be ""sound ready"" but makes no sound. Other parts that move, don't make sounds. I'm guessing there are a max of 5 working sounds, as of the first time I put in the batteries. Kinda funny, didn't even come with batteries!I will purchase additional Little People sets, but am weary of the overall quality at this point."
4,"Good first dollhouse, skip batteries","This is a great first dollhouse for little ones. Do not use batteries as the sound is too loud. Plus, your child can hear all of these home sounds in your actual home. If you had to choose between this and the farm/barn I'd choose the barn because the sounds are new and unique to most kids' environments and the sound on that toy is lower. Still, this is cute and has great imaginative play possibilities without the sounds."
1,This is not the one being advertised,"The one they are advertising is not the one you will receive. The one shown has nine sounds and no fluffy the cat. The one you will receive has three sounds and includes fluffy the cat. There are two models, so it is confusing. I've ordered this twice already and each time I didn't receive the one being advertised. I don't know why they don't advertise it for what it is. The model you get sells for about $30.00. Amazon is selling that model too. Ihave no idea why they don't correct this. I've already fallen for it twice. You would think I would have learned the first time."
4,Hours of entertainment at a very good price,"We got this for our daughter's recent first birthday, and it has already proven its worth. She enjoys pressing the objects that make noise (phone, toilet, etc.), then laughing at her accomplishments. She will also use the house as a place for playing with other toys.The assembly required is extremely minimal - just a few screws - and while there are many stickers to put on before the house is complete, it's certainly not difficult or time-consuming. The product seems durable, at least what I've seen of it to this point.While I don't know how enjoyable this would be for an older child, I certainly think it's an excellent choice as a first dollhouse for a younger child. And with the relatively low price, it's not going to be too painful if your little one doesn't enjoy it as much as you'd like."
5,Happy Little Home,"My daughter just loves this toy! She has played with it every single day since she got it. She seems to prefer this house over her other ""Little People"" toys. Every room has sound features that she loves. She can pretend to do laundry with the washing machine sounds, or she can make the phone ring and the kitchen timer go off. The sounds are very realistic. This is a great toy for a 2 year old girl. My daughter also likes the free Little People DVD that came with it. I think this toy is well worth the money."
4,Cute!,I bought this for my daughter because I figured she's at the stage where a little play house would be good. She plays with it a little bit and presses some of the buttons and likes it. So it's worth it but she already pulled off the fence and took off one of the stickers.Still decent though.
4,Hours of Entertainment,"MY daughter receievd this as a gift at her 1st birthday. She is now 15 months and there isn't a day that goes by where she doesn't play with it. When she first got it, she would play with it for up to an hour...and was very content. She loves to push the button in the crib and repeat MAMA over and over. She giggles at the sounds of the ringing telephone, the toilet flushing, etc. Since it has helped her to say the word MAMA even better, I gave this a 3 star rating in education since this toy really isn't an educational toy in my opinion."
2,Interesting Topic but Lack of Evidence,"This book explores a phenomenon termed ""psychic vampirism"". Specifically, it deals with people who limit the energy and auras of others via vampiric tendencies that sometimes augment their own energy and aura. Amazing. However, the author does not cite a lot of evidence to support his claims. As a Ph.d. I would imagine that he would be accustomed to supporting all of his claims with facts. The problem with this book is that while there are some intriguing clues into psychic vampirism, the author combines reincarnation, astral projection, aura viewing, crystal healing, etc. without really proving any of them. There are some very interesting photographs of auras. The author should've provided more of that type of information instead of going from one claim to the next without really proving the vast majority of them."
1,"tin foil hat, anyone?","Bank Account Vampires: Protection from people who tell you there are ""evil spirits out to get you"" in order to drain you of your hard earned cash."
4,What you don't know can drain you?,"This book is a must have especially for people who work in for corporations or anyone who works with the public in general. It touches on alot of things we never even realize. Even talks about how in relationships we could be victims of a psychic vampire or the predator. Alot of times it is a totally unconscious that a person is draining others of energy. In todays society with all thats going on we need to be aware. Not paranoid just aware. This book is a must have for anyone in a draining relationship,codependant relationships,working in the public or anyone studying the psychic realm. Very beneficial information to have."
3,Slate doesn't cover all the bases with this book.,"While this book is very effective in strengthening a person's energy system, and may help in providing basic defense against unconcsious psychic vampires, it doesn't provide the reader with a way to defend themself against a psychic vampire who is conscious of his/her 'ability'. In this case, the book actually opens one up to psychic attakc by providing a vampire with higher quality energy to feed from. And shielding is useless against psychic feeding, as it merely concentrates the energy outside of the body, making it EASIER to take. I wouldn't take this book TOO seriously."
4,Good looking plane,"Detailed and challenging build. What I mean by challenging is that a third of the parts are so tiny. Its a pretty easy build over all but some of the parts are so small and delicate that it makes some portions of the build a chore.However, after I built and painted it. It turned out to be a pretty good looking and detailed Eurofighter. The only gripe I have about the quality of the kit is that the clear parts were a little warped. There was a gap between the cockpit window and the main body because of the warp so I had to use the clear window maker glue to bridge it.I would NOT recommend this for people under 13 because of the many tiny parts. Some kids won't have the patience to finish it because of this."
3,Not bad,"Anthony Berger has some interesting things to say about Macking. But the marketplace nowadays is crowded with much deeper material. Real Social Dynamics, Mystery and Charisma Arts all offer competing products of pretty high quality, although not in this price range. David DeAngelo offers audio interviews in the same price range, and I think it's much better.Some of the advice also reads a little strange, especially the chapter that talks about positioning yourself so you can continue scanning the room while the girl can't. Not sure that's particularly important..."
2,"Borrow, Don't Buy","I was very disappointed in this book because there's not much new here. If you've ever slept with a woman you probably know 95% of the information in this book. If not, then you had better be an extremely confident virgin to attempt any of the moves in this book. The subtitle is very misleading: ""A Shy Man's Guide to One Night Stands"". If you're shy this is NOT the book for you. Also, ""Advanced Macking""? Showering, shaving and wearing expensive clothes aren't exactly advanced techniques. To top it all off, I found the number of misspelled words and incidences of poor grammar to be very distracting. A true player would never use the word ""hoe"" to describe a woman much less spell it with an ""e"". I did give this book two stars for the original material (the 5%) however."
5,Achingly beautiful,"Finding this single in a bargain bin was such a piece of divine enhancement for my life. Of course, I heard the critical acclaim, but it doesn't seem possible that one person could be that good. Until you hear him. His voice can soar to the heights and swoon to the depths, touching everything he sings with magic that strikes a chord in all of us. He will be sorely missed, but his legend will keep on growing."
1,Shame on Amazon,"I am a teacher in a public Junior High who is doing a unit on the Olympics--like many teachers, I have to find my own resources and often times pay for them out of my own pocket. When I go to Amazon for help, I expect that they understand I have limited time and would appreciate some background on the books I order---nowhere did this book, GO FOR GOLD indicate that it was a bible version of inpsiration and Christian interpretation of athletics--not even using real contests just their names--I can not use this book in my classroom and will not ever order class resource books from Amazon again. They should at least include the author's or publisher's blurb on the back cover--that would have saved me some precious money and agitation!"
5,Delivered as promised,"Exactly what I wanted....purchased my Bose 901s in 1993. In many moves, my old speakers stands became damaged. The new speaker stands are just like the originals."
3,Dull bling- bling,"Whoa! What happened? When I pulled this pendant out of it lovely, velvet pouch, I was surprised to see how small it was (the exact same size as a nickel). In the picture it appears to be bigger. You won't see it sparkle like it does in the picture, either. I am still happy with it but it is not what I expected."
3,"nice pendant, but thin chain","Necklace came in nice black velevet pouch. It looked very sparkly and I couldn't wait to put it on, and when I did, it fell right off. The clasp on the chain broke. The chain is very thin. I sent it back and they credited my account within days."
4,Super Producer,"If you really get into the Intricacies or innovations from production, then you will love this trip into music euphoria. Ayatollah makes you listen to the same music differently by the way he presents it. Hats off"
5,Best use of objective correlative since T. S. Eliot.,"Billy Collins' latest, 'Picnic, Lightning' is an inspiring string of pearls. Each poem, a lustrous contrast of imagination within reality. As in 'Aristotle',a streak of light in the sky, a hat on a peg, and outside the cabin, falling leaves.Collins wrecklessly selects objects that evoke both sullen and inspiring emotions. His talent resides not only in his choice of images but also in his ability to gather them into a lucid believable form, as in 'After the Storm':Soft yellow-gray light of early morning, butter and wool, the two bedroom windows still beaded and streaked with rain.Butter and wool, one can just feel the morning come, the rain gently falling, the mood clearly laid out. This is the excellence that presides over this collection.Buy it, sit with it, let it permeate your senses. You will be a changed person for having read it."
2,Little Jimmy Dickens,"I, frankly, have no idea what all the fuss is about. Collin's upper middle class portrait of life is for the most part a bore. There's nothing electric happening here. And I mean formally. These poems sit so lightly on the page it's as if they were printed on the paper by a soft perfumed flower, and the same flower over and over again. Kenneth Koch writes sledfuls of happy poems (and funny ones), and yet you come away from reading his work feeling as if your perceptions have been stretched. Not here. Collin's voice is so soft, so inoffensive, so AGREEABLE, that about ten minutes with him is enough for me. I like my poets to occasionally stray over a forbidden boundry or two and get lost. The excitement is in watching them find their way back. It's called tension. These poems lack it."
4,Tropical Gel does contain caffeine,I bought this product because I was looking for a gel that did not contain caffeine and it states in the description that only the coffee flavoured one does. But the tropical contains 25mg of caffeine.
1,what the?!!!,"The ad offered a 12 Pack for $1.40, as if it were a sale to get rid of slow moving product. At $5.22 shipping you would think so. However they only shipped 1Lousy pouch and still charged $.33 for shipping. the pouch only weighs about 2oz. what a big JIP..."
4,very nice,"i would suggest it for teens if anyone. They would be able to take their dvd's to anyone's house, and share the fun."
5,5 STAR SAUCES FROM A 5 STAR SAUTE PAN,"Heavy ga. metal allows for even cooking & no hot spots. I got this pan on 11-21-08 and used it for thanksgiving diner.I love trying new sauces,and this is excellent for making them in.Pan dripping gravy is easy to make,because it doesn't stick."
2,Vonage okay; router poor,"The vonage service is tolerable. For $15 or $25/month, you get enough service for what you need. Sometimes there is echo on the line, but it's usually okay.I am unimpressed with the RT31P2. My dhcp hosts table fills up with bogus 00-00-00-00-00-00 mac addresses, and resetting the dhcp doesn't do the job. I eventually had to set up my own DHCP server at home.The DDNS to dyndns.org doesn't work properly. It never does the automatic refresh so my system regularly loses its dyndns address.Today it is displaying a new failure mode, where the router is unreachable for administration but still works for phone and onto the internet. I guess I should be happy because a reboot clears this problem, but I've never had a router from linksys or dlink that has been this screwy."
3,"good idea, mediocre product","I had this router with vonage for several months, but eventually gave it up because there were too many issues, and I grew tired of speaking to tech support. With many calls, after a few minutes suddenly the line would mess up and I could hear the other person but they couldn't hear me, or vice versa. My dad has also had a number of problems with his vonage account, and now we both largely use our cell phones, as neither of us has a landline any more. The idea of unlimited long distance both to the US and nearby countries is enticing, but I won't be trying it again until the quality is closer to that of landline phones. I'll look forward to that time, as it was very convenient to be able to take the router and plug it into any cable modem I came across, and use it as if I were still at home."
2,Crap!,"Got the router, installed it, used it with Vonage for last 2 years:1) Slow to reboot2) Have to reboot after EVERY configuration screen.3) Drops your calls when rebooting (some routers don't!)4) Every 2-3 months the router gets ""constipated"" and gets very sluggish and unreliable requiring a HARD reset and reconfiguration (see #2 above).5) This model is LOCKED to Vonage service.... can't change Voip service providers.6) After 2 years the router simply quit working. All the lights work, but it doesn't route anymore and it doesn't let you make phone calls anymore.7) Small glitches with its routing ability. The more configuration you do, the slower the routing becomes. Very underpowered processor doing the routing.So yes, Vonage is inexpensive phone service.... but when you have to buy a new router every 1-2 years it isn't as cheap as you initially think!!"
2,Dreaded Blinking Power Light,"As I read through the other reviews, I realized that my experience was way too common. It worked fine for about a year, with various reboots needed to get it back working, and then all of a sudden I get the dreaded blinking power light. It will not boot up. Now I have to go buy another router. Sounds like this Linksys product is a dud."
1,The money you save is not worth the time you'll spend fixing this system!!,"I was thrilled that I could save money on my phone bill, but this system is down every other week. When it is working, the line if very loud and noisy. I worry that we will have an emergency and be unable to call 911 because our Vonage is down AGAIN! Getting someone to help takes a long time, they are nice and very polite, but expect to spend several hours (at least) turning things on and off and checking your computer settings with the tech support every time it goes down. I wish I had stayed with AT&T. Getting my phone number transferred to Vonage was such an ordeal, I have not switched back to AT&T yet because I don't have the energy for the transfer drama."
1,A Piece of junk,It dies right after the Warranty expires. The power keeps blinking. Vonage technical support confirned a dead router. This is my first linksys equipment and will be my last.
1,Worst customer service ever,"I have been working with the Vonage customer service line for three days now and still do not have a working phone. First they told told me to go out and buy a device that they later told me would not work with their service. I finally get the right device and was told my phone should be working at midnight. The phone never started working...still isn't. I call the customer service line again and they tell me to call the people at linksys. The number they gave me for linksys turns out to be a Gay Sex Hotline, I guess they thought this would be funny? I called back to get the correct number and the man tells me that they do not have the number and puts me on hold to talk to his manager. I wait for about 15 minutes then hang up....so NO I would deffinately not recommed vonage."
1,Vonage???,"I had to try it out. I hear so much advertising and hype about Vonage. So, I went down to the local computer store and bought it took it home to set it up and problems right off the back. I have a 3mb DSL connection that is great. I used the temp number and started to make calls, the quality was poor. There was a echo and a delay that was very annoying, I would often talk over people. I tried it for the trial period and then returned it. I called their support and if I have to wait 20 miniutes forget it! I tried 3 times and they lost a customer.I looked at other companies and found a smaller VoIP provider that is working great for me OurDigitalVoice. I called their tech support a 2 min wait and the people are friendly and informed. Vonage is just too big for their britches if you ask me!"
1,DON'T DO IT!,"Please, I beg of you, do not get involved with Vonage. I must have spent 4 hours waiting on hold to reach customer service, billing, and number transfer. The only person I was able to speak to after 2 months was someone in the cancelation department! Get this, there is a $40 chage for canceling the service hidden in the contract!! While the device itself works, everything about Vonage is underhanded. All I can say is don't do it...."
3,Alright,Well I only use it to put internet in the other computers and it works and even though I had trouble with the setup I still say the setup was easy.But for all the other stuff like fax and phone I can't mention on thatVerdict: 5.0 out of 5.0 I gave 3 stars at top cause I don't use it for fax and phones so I can't actually give it a 5 but if you are going to use the router of same reasons then yeah it works.
3,Excellent function for years and then disaster!,I purchased my unit from Vonage in July 2005. I paid a $40 setup fee and they sent the package. Everything has been fantastic until a week ago. Now the unit has stopped giving a dial tone and I am finding out what all the negative reviews are about. This unit only works with Vonage and Vonage tech support is slow and terrible. All they seem to know how to do is unplug things. It is clear to me the device has malfunctioned since all my network is fine save the phone.Not sure I need this anymore with Comcast phones available and cell phones so cheap. Pity. I liked the service but the tech support is not good.
5,Better than hell keep everyone crazy!,"A true decent heavy metal album.From speed sound of ""Push"" to the power balad ""Time"" You must have this album!"
2,NOT AGAIN...,"HELLOWEEN failed again and released another bad album that makes us feel certain they'll never release grat albuns again.. the catchy tune ""I CAN"" is a shame to the band..."
5,Lisle 10000 cylinder hone,This appears to be a good quality tool for the price. I used the tool to hone axle shaft holes where the u-joint caps are pressed into.
4,"Fast shipping, product in good condition",One warning: the sizes listed in the product description can be deceiving. The ramekins are smaller than you would think.
5,HIC 3-ounce Porcelain Souffle 2.75-inch Set of 6,"What can you say about an item like this HIC 3-ounce Porcelain Souffle 2.75-inch Set of 6, it works well."
2,horrible instructions; kind of cheaply made,"it is obvious the least amount of money went into the materials budget for this crate; i liked the ""plastic"" idea for the door instead of metal,however the plastic is cheap plastic and i think anything more than a teacup chihuahua puppy which i bought this for) would probably chew thru the door... the instructions are so poorly written and i am a college graduate (if that means anything), and because of the poorly written instructions, i unfortunately broke off a part of one of two plastic door ""latches""; again, very cheaply made...but it will do for now while the teacup is still so tiny and cant do much damage"
2,Great Price....But...,Don't buy the one with the plastic door. (Get the one with the metal door). The plastic door carrier is hard to latch. And the fasteners to keep the top locked onto the bottom are plastic and MUST be checked ALL the time to make sure the carrier doesn't fall apart while the cat is inside.
1,"Cheap, but also cheaply made...","The crate itself is OK, but the door makes this product not worth buying. The door is made of plastic that is quite easy to bend or break. You should not trust your cat to be secure in this carrier...you will be worrying that the door will fail and the cat will escape. Terrible crate...one of the worst ones I've seen. In general, crates with plastic doors tend to be poorly made."
2,"Christie says, ''Losing weight is cool!''","I love this doll, except I have one complaint: the little cardboard magazines. Up close they say things like, ''I LOST 20 LBS.-SO CAN YOU'' and ''LOSE 10 LBS. IN 10 DAYS.'' Who the heck does she think she is? So, Mattel, because you did not ask Richard Simmons or Dr. Phil or Leslie Sansone to help her lose weight, I hate this!!!"

3,Typical Barbie,"This ""Movie Star Christie"" Barbie models a purple dress, a purple feather boa and has a few accessories. She is nothing special...just a typical Barbie doll. She has the cheap plastic accessories, and cheaply-made material for her clothes. If you are looking for a regular Barbie, than this is the one to get, but if you want to get an exciting doll that has cooler accessories, pay the extra dollar and get a Bratz or My Scene doll (another Mattel product.) I hope this review helped."
2,Good but too agrivating and hard.,"This game is somewhat good if you brought some Gameshark with you to play it... this game really angers me because no matter what the chances are on the battlefield, I'm always dying, plus it got scratched up badly. All that hard-earned money I spent down the toilet."
1,"Confusing Tactics,","I never did get to far playing this game. I just don't get the hang of it. So I quit this game soon after I started. I like a game I can get somewhere with. I guess I didn't understand what it was all about when I bought it. Somebody else might do alright with it, but not me."
1,disappointment,"i was disappointed w/this game. of course, i bought this one after i got and played final fantasy iii. although, i did take forever finishing this game. what i hated most was not have free range of movement, you can't even walk around."
1,YOU ARE SO RIGHT,"YOU are so RIGHT to say this game puts you in medieval times. Too bad it is because the game is worthless. I problably would sell it for [price] new. I think there are other games out there which are not so ""medieval"" because this one just invented the wheel."
4,I remember this game...,"I remember playing this game... I remember liking it, too. I haven't played it in forever, but I remember liking the look of it, and the gameplay. Don't remember too much of the story, though. I remember the music being pretty good, too. Yeah, I should definitely look into getting this again. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
3,the game's rating,"the game still played but when it arrived it looked nothing like the picture the case was cracked and the cover was gone, the disc was also scratched"
5,Final Fantasy Tactics - The best Fantasy Yet.,"Final Fantasy Tactics - a chess-like strategic breakthrough from the ever powerful Square company. With a near endless supply of unique jobs, you play the Role of Ramza, and with a team of up to 30 characters, you travel a five-chaptered story. This game is very, very worthwhile, and since it has been re-released, is now available once again! I have a friend who has beaten this game and he tells me that it [FFT] is very interesting and fun. I am almost through the 3rd chapter, and so far... I agree."
2,Not that great,"Final fantasy tactics was...low on the scale of best final fantasy games of the year , mine at least. while the whole move only one the blue squares thing during battle was imaginative. Rhapsody and Arc the lad have simular concepts and are way better planed out .the music for this game was fair but i got annoyed at it most of the time so i turned it on mute and listend to rock instead,Graphics are alright the world view could have been better but i did like the images of the people though the could have fixed the faces ..they seemed...longer than normal facesthe mood of this game is dark and many might not get the plot. heck i stopped reading it after half an hour i got so confused, if you can bear to figure the storline out please tell me.all in all though this gave me 10 hours of fun (or something to do after homework) it was alright, hard and confusing but ok. those of you who want to buy it . i suggest you rent it first and see how you like it."
1,this game is a piece of ...!! i hated it!!!,"man,this game was awful!! it was like playing vitual chess!!! you only had like 2 main characters and the rest were all warriors that when K.O. ED stayed that way!!it was soooooo stupid!! and way too ... easy!! and alot of your items miss. like when you put a pheonix down on someone it would miss!!i didnt even get the storyline of this game. big deal ramzas father died!!like that doesnt happen every day!!its not like he was immortal!!i know i am not a pro at gaming but seriously when you say agame is that good you should actually mean it!!!! the people in this game are soooo ,well,FLAT!theyre like papaer!i for one personally hated this game but this my opinion and you can dissagree with me!!"
1,"If you have to try it, then rent it!!","Hello. Don't buy this--ever. Play three hours and you'll see what I mean. The battle system is only good if you like chess. The characters are stupid, stupid stupid (Ramaza, whom I thought was a girl at first, is the [weakest] and most heretic in the series)! The plot is cheesey. Why can only the enemy use the zodiac stones?! Why do you have to go through the job point system? Why can't you use your exerience?! Most of all, why do you have to be a level two squire to be a knight,etc?!!... Oh, remember. Don't buy this!!!!"
1,Final Fantasy Tactics,"This game sucked! The story line was wierd, and their was way to much talking of the start! The battles sucked! They took way to long! The graphics sucked to! Everything about this game sucked!Worst Game Ever!!!!"
4,Excellent,Final Fantasy Tactics is for people who have lots of time and dedication for a good RPG. This game can be over 200 hours long so dont think it's short because it's one disk. Excellent battle system and overall a must have for anyone who plays Final Fantasy games.
4,A game that suffers from its series,"I think if this game didn't bear the name Final Fantasy it would be remembered as the masterpiece it is, and not as a diappointment. The game is an innovation. It can be frustrating when your spells don't hit or your potion is off target at the right time, but even that adds something to the game. Th graphics are rudimentary, but the don't need to be flashy. Flashy graphics would probably have interupted the flow of the game. I would suggest this game for people with a bit of a patience and a lot of time."
1,very disappointing denis,"This album was what, like 12 minutes long, had two 2 minute skits, and the rest was more or less junk except for the x-mas song which was only mildly amusing.To top it all off, one of the song tracks was also already featured on ""Lock 'n' Load"", and the christmas song was repeated twice, sounding the same both times, except that one was supposed to be live.Life is going to suck if you buys this, wether you're grown up or not."
1,Very Disappointed,"Perhaps there is no person more of a Denis Leary fan than I am and I give it one star. This cd reminds me of the product put out by record companies after the artist has left their label. They throw together whatever was left on the editing floor and hype it as ""new"" from the artist. At least I hope that is what this disaster is. I hate to think that someone as talented as Denis Leary could have put much, if any, effort into the project.For some reason, I don't know, the video didn't come through for me. At least that would have been fun to watch!"
3,"All the kids go to bed each night, to dream what Santa brings 'em, unless they're Jewish or Muslim or some other gyp religion.","This is an EP featuring Denis Leary's Christmas song ""Merry F#%$in' Christmas"". It is a very funny song, and there are two versions of it, a ""regular"" version made in a recording studio and a ""live"" version. The rest of the CD features skits and outtakes from his albumLock 'N Load, plus a few live stand up performances. Most of it is moderately funny, but it doesn't have anything to do with Christmas."
2,Merry F#%$in' Christmas?... Hardly =\,"After getting the first 2 cds years ago: No cure For Cancer & Lock N Load. I was hooked on Denis Leary.. He was one of if not my favorite comedian.. I was big on Adam Sandler's ""They're All Going Laugh at You"" but the other ones weren't as good.. Much like The latest from the cigarette smoking, coffee drinking mad man Denis Leary.. Merry F#%%$in' Christmas lacked something... It left me going ""that's it?"" It's lucky if its 40mins long. It's not really that great either. His previous two were ALOT better. If you're a major fan of his work you can get it.. but don't say I didn't warn you.."
1,Total crap,"I would have to disagree with the previous posts. Although the christmas song was amusing, it is the worst compilation of Dennis Leary material I have heard. Do not buy!!"
4,Spread good cheer or burn in hell...,"Finally something new from the great comedian Denis Leary. Unfortunatly, it's somewhat of a let-down in terms of the running time.It's nice to hear some live routines from him that I hadn't heard before, though. The two tracks from ""Lock N' Load"" are unnecessary. I mean if you're purchasing this cd then chances are you already own ""Lock N' Load"", and don't want repeated material, but I mean for the price it is, it's worth it for the title song alone."
5,"Denis Leary does it again, this time for Xmas.","If you're familiar with Denis Leary, you know what to expect. Irreverence, strong language, strong opinions, and a ""who-cares-what-you-think"" attitude. Denis takes on the holiday season here, and no religion is spared. He skewers every faith in his own inimitable style. There are other tracks on the cd, of course, but I bought it for this one after watching his special on Comedy Central. Great for driving in the car on the way to the Mall to do your holiday shopping!"
5,Good read,"I picked this book up at a local bookstore. It was on the bum rack, so I assumed I'd purchase it because it was cheap, and hoped that it would turn out to be a good book.After finishing this book, I am glad to say that i bought it. The writing style is fresh, and the overall content of the book was excellent. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."
5,Brilliant Novel,"In the tradition of Fitzgerald's This Side of Paradise, and The Great Gatsby, this beautifully crafted novel stays in the imagination long after you've turned the last page. The novel has the quality and vitality of memoir -- you feel what it was like to be young back in the 60's, with the Vietnam war just beginning to stir in the country's collective conscience (a subject even more topical now, what with John Kerry and the Swift Boat controversy in all the headlines.) The characters are so vivid you feel you know them.But there is also something more important at work here. Lewis is not the first writer to contrast the idealism and best hopes of youth with the nightmare of the years to come, although he may be one of the most skillful. But he is the first to do so so effectively with our generation, which has produced Bush and Kerry (and so many of us now pushing middle age).Every generation produces its own Fitzgerald. Mr. Lewis is ours."
1,Take this book with a large grain of salt.,"Sorry, I cannot buy into this one. I have seen other books claiming all these markings are for hidden Spanish gold of the Conquistadors, or the ""Lost Dutchman"" gold mine, or who knows what. Bottom line, a lot of smoke, very little fire. Finding a few old silver dollars does not mean much. Book contains much speculation and theory, very little proof. Finally, I submit Benjamin Franklin-""Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead."" Even if such a hoard was buried, I expect it was dug up many years ago."
3,Conspiracies abound,"Is it true? Who knows. The real question is whether the book can keep my interest. At first it did a great job in laying out the story as the authors saw it. Unfortunately most of the last half of the book is spent trying to describe how he ""located"" the ""treasure"" spots. It also included maps which to my inexperienced eyes seem more of a stretch. I agree if there was a succession of Confederate treasure spots it would make sense that they all were laid out in similar patterns with markers. The question is whether you believe his explanation of markings. I have to admit it seems a bit of a stretch but who knows stranger things have happened I guess. The real problem is the book simply falls apart half way through whether true or not you no longer care."
4,Undiscovered History,"I stumbled across this book while looking up some family history on the internet. I had entered only one name, but when the search returned a link to Shadow of the Sentinel, several more family names appeared. After seeing this I had to have it.When the book arrived I was surprised to find that the author lives (and a good portion of the story takes place) in my hometown. This book has not only revealed a doorway to a shadowy period in America's past, but also gave me a glimpse into my own family's history. Stuff Granny never mentioned!I sent a copy to my brother as a gift, and he tells me that the movie ""National Treasure 2"" mentions some of the same material that this book covers. This is a good read for treasure hunters and historians alike."
2,I am still reading this book!,"I am still reading this book, it is taking me a while to get into it; maybe after I have read it a couple of time I will like it more but, as of now I am working on it."
1,Don't waste your time.,"If this book wasn't being presented as a non-fiction book, it might have been a good read. I am afraid I have to play the BS card on it. How many items would have been found by urban sprawl alone?"
4,For the Arm Chair Treasure Hunter,An enjoyable book that will no doubt wet one's appetite for digging deeper into the lost treasure of the confederacy and all those suspected of having a hand in it's placement.
2,Too many lunges,"This workout is very repetitive with lunges and squats. As someone with bad knees, it would have been nice to know that before purchasing it. The dialogue is a bit cheesey and unprofessional. I did enjoy the floor work. Also, the background setting looks cheap and is therefore distracting."
5,Great B-Sides,I LOVE 'This Side of Me' and all of the other songs on this CD. Definatly worth getting. The TTMAB remix starts out very nice and 'is' a bit different than the original one..
5,Coments on Savage Garden,I just wanted to say that Savage Garden is the BEST bend that ever came out on the Maket. They have everything for every age. Their love songs one can listen over and over again. However I just wanted to let you know about the way I feel abuot this.Thank you for the oportunity!!!
2,wild roots,"it doesnt have pictures of the plants, which make indentifying the roots alot easier, they need to add photos for easier identification."
5,I enjoyed this book...,I enjoyed this book very much. I met Doug Elliott not too long ago and found him to be very entertaining and is quite the character. He really knows what he is talking about. I am looking forward to reading his other books and listening to his CDs.
1,You might try another book,"This book is well and fine if you happen to live in the Appalacian mountains. Outside that region, however, it is useless. Mr. Elliots botanical knowledge seems to be geographicaly quite limited. The illustrations of the roots themselves are very good. But the pictures of the plants themselves are small and nondiscript. This leads the question of ""How do I find the root if I can't find it's top?"". I highly would recommend one of the Peterson guides before this book."
5,Perfect and colorful,They do their job and they look really cute. Easy to wash (I do it by hand) and really lightweight.
4,Love it,Very hard to find item in local hardware or discount stores. I love putting clothes on the line & this certainly is handy. Little pricey for such a simple product -- could have made it less expensively. Also had to bend the hook tighter - - too open to adequately stay on the line.
1,Not Good,"Thought it would work out with helping store the pins and not keep them on the line , put in the clothespins and the hook on top could not hold the weight , if fell off .... a bad product for sure , did not work out for meNate 12/21/2012"
2,Not worth the dollars...,"When I purchased this I must have been computer drunk. I could not believe there was to be 0 wood clothespins coming as part of this expensive canvas bag. It really isn't worth the money, unless they throw in at least 50 to100 clothespins and disclose how this material may not do well outside in the elements. The bag really gets dirty, quickly, and we live in sunny Southern California. I would have returned it but I was waiting for those included clothespins, and by the time I read and reread the description, the light finally went off and that bag was just too dirty to return. Oh well, you live and learn..."
5,Neat Little Clothespin Bag bought at Amazon.com!,"For several years, I would put my clothes pins in a small basket. Got tired of the basket idea so bought this neat bag from your compnay. It's such a cute little bag with an embroidered ""clothes pin"" on the outside and made from good quality fabric. Works perfect for my purpose; love it."
4,Clothespin Bag,"It is amazingly difficult to find a really functional clothespin bag. This one is near perfect. I bent the hook that goes over the line to a tighter curve so it doesn't fall off as some other users had reported. The opening is just a tad small. But overall, I'm satisfied."
3,Nothing Special,This clothespin bag holds clothespins and there is really nothing more to say except the fact there is absolutely nothing that sets it apart from any other canvas clothespin bag.Purchasing this item was a waste of money because I am able to use my air dryers without clothespins.
3,Not too thrilled,"The canvas on this bag seems sturdy enough, but the hanger that comes with it isn't too great. It's two pieces, and is weirdly put together. The first time I hung this bag on my clothesline, it fell right on the ground. When I picked it up, I found the hanger was in two pieces. I thought it had broken, but my husband looked at it, and said, no, that's how it's supposed to be. So I put it back together and continued to use it.After a month or so, I noticed the edge of the metal hanger and punched a hole on the corner of the bag. Luckily I had saved the plastic hanger from my previous vintage clothespin bag, so I was able to replace it. Really shouldn't have had to do that, but will continue to use it that way.So it's still usable, but when I do have to replace it, it won't be with this brand."
1,Mildew,"After just a few weeks outside, it started to develop mildew spots. This is not tough enough for outdoor use."
2,"Great Look, Lacking quality","I loved this bag when it arrived. Looked great, perfect size...but it fell apart within a month. The metal hanger poked a hole through the side of the canvas bag. And worse,the seam along the top came loose and the hanger fell out. I guess I'll be getting a different bag :("
4,Good insiders views,It's good to hear what's going on over there directly from the people involved. It was also good to be reminded of the incredible sacrifice our military people are making for us.
1,This Book is Government Propoganda,"If you like reading Government censored material; if you liked reading such hard hitting newspapers as Pravda, then you will love this book. All the writers were soldiers which means, by default, they were covered under the UCMJ and prevented from saying things detrimental to the Government. They also were under OPSEC (Operational security) requirements which means they could not report everything. Further, most were under a ""registration"" order meaning they had to register their writings with their commander which resulted in regular ""reviews"" of their writings.Even the write of the book admitted on CSPAN that they could not write about things like ""when a patrol went bad"".So, much like 1984 and the days of the Communist publications such as Pravda, this book is a group of censored writings from soldiers."
5,Direct Replacement,While this item is not an exact replacement for an older Elixir vent cap it is a direct replacement. Mine came with a little information sheet that showed the differences between the original opener bracket and the bracket on this one. I had to take more of the vent apart to install the vent cap than I normally would but in the end it worked perfectly.
1,don't buy,"I have had many Sinuspulse, the quality is not perfect, so I have tried to change and ordered the Grossan one. The pressure of the engine is not strong enough. I have throw it in the trash tonight."
4,Hydro pulse,"This product seems to be a nifty item for nasal irrigation. I've only tried it once, because I haven't had much sinus trouble lately. Some people use it everyday or once a week, but I elected to use it when I'm experiencing nasal or sinus trouble. There does seem to be some nasal drip from time to time unexpectedly after using it, so keep tissues handy for several hours as it can come at any time, or if you turn your head at the right angle for one of the sinuses to drain the wash fluid will come dripping out."
4,Life Changing Device,"After 2 surgeries and more drugs than Kieth Richards ever thought about taking, I settled back and decided there was no hope for my chronic sinus infection.Then I found this and in two weeks felt better than I had in more years than I could remember.The idea is brilliant, this piece of hardware, not so much. After two in one year, I went to WM and bought the cheapest water pick they had. Works just as well as far as I can tell."
3,Would appreciate hearing about any negative experiences with this product,"Before buying my Grossan Hydro Pulse I checked out all the reviews I could find.Never before have I read so many positive reviews on a product !!Perhaps that is my problem - EVERYONE experienced such good results that I was expecting COMPLETE RELIEF INSTANTLY. Maybe that was unrealistic.I have now used the irrigator 3 times. With each use my sinus are worse and more stuffed up. It seems as if water is being forced into places and can't drain out.With all the good reviews I have trouble thinking that my condition is unique and uncurable. I keep hoping that it will just take some time for the cilia to get working properly and that I should remain patient until then. However, I am starting to worry if I may be making my condition worse.I tried to call the company, but they were quite uncooperative in offering any advice whatsoever.Has anyone else experienced similar initial symptoms that later improved?"
2,I wish I'd saved my money,"I don't see how this is any better than the plunge type nasal irrigators. it's okay, but I caught another sinus infection two weeks after using it religiously when I first got it. I wish I'd saved the money and not given up the limited counter space I have. The company was hard to reach by email and phone and unhelpful when I tried to contact them to see if I was using the device properly."
5,Effective alternative method to deal with chronic sinusitis,"Grossan Hydro Pulse Pulsatile Nasal & Sinus Irrigation System is an effective way to deal with chronic sinusitis. The Health Ease-XL packets that come with it are easier on the nasal passages than OTC saline packets. Now having compared both products, I would recommend that you order the health-ease XL while ordering this sinus irrigation system.For traveler's it is compact, easy to use, and clean up is simple as it requires only the use of tap water after daily use, and diluted vinegar once a week. The result of using this system is no more infections and this product was recommened by my ENT physician."
5,Great invention,"I bought this product two years ago to assist with my battle against chronic sinusitis. I have used it faithfully ever since, and I have been very happy with this product. It's a bit loud, but other than that, I can't think of any complaints I have with it. The price is well worth it, especially when compared with what I previously was spending on decongestants."
4,Satisfied with Grossan Hydro Pulse Nasal & Sinus Irrigation System,"I am very satisfied with my new Grossan Hydro Pulse Nasal & Sinus Irrigation System. It is easy to use and comes with several attachments. It doesn't hold quite as much as my old sinus irrigation system and the pressure is not as strong, but it works well and I am very happy with it."
4,"good, but same as a waterpick...","It works exactly as you'd expect it would, but I could have saved some money by finding a sinus attachment head (if waterpick even sells them) to use with my waterpick... there's literally no difference... both the waterpick and the hydropulse have the pulsing water. It is convenient to use and own if you need a sinus irrigator. I just wish they designed the saline water container a little better. It leaves about 1/4 inch of saline water at the bottom of the container that doesn't get pumped, so it gets wasted. Although it may not sound like a lot, you'd be suprised how fast the saline water gets pumped out and before you know it, your container is out of saline water, then you have to dump it out, wishing the remaining would just make it out."
5,Wonderful!,"I had been reading the reviews for months after my doctor recommended this to help with my allergies. I am highly allergic to plants in my area and the cats I live with. I have been on 3 prescriptions daily for the past 5 years, but had reached the point that the medications were no longer working. Instead of increasing the dosages, I opted to try this machine. It's amazing. This is my first review on Amazon, so it had to take something good for me to take the time to do this.I was the type of person that sneezed many times a day, always had a runny nose and never went without tissue in my pocket...despite my prescription medication for allergies. The relief I have experienced in just a few days is amazing. I am clear, sneeze-free and it lasts all day. I would really recommend this to someone who has seasonal allergies or needs extra help beyond medication."
4,Already bought two of these that broke,"I find these essential, given my sinus problems. Each one lasted about two years. Finally, the motor just won't start. Maybe that is what you can expect from a simple $100 machine, but rather than buy a third, I am going to try another model."
2,Not built to last and possible fire hazard,"After my second unit broke within 4 years I've decided it's time to write a review. When this device works, it works great! Nasal irrigation has changed my life for the better. But this device is poorly designed and poorly constructed. The design flaws are that it's impossible to keep clean. The hard to reach crevasses are a breeding ground for bacteria and short of detailing it weekly with a cotton swab and alcohol, you'll never get it clean. As for build quality the fluid container has a poor seal and will fail after a couple years of use which leaks water. The motor will fail after even a year of use. My first one died after a year and the next one lasted 3. also I noticed that motor was burning the plastic housing of the device. I saw melted brown plastic on the back which says to me that it's a safety hazard."
2,"Somewhat useful, but beware!","Based on reviews I read on this site, I purchased one of these devices. The jury is still out on whether I find it effective. But what really disappointed me was the torrent of spam I started receiving just after my purchase. It was obvious that Hydromed or their fulfillment company sold my name and email to spammers. A complaint to their customer service was not responded to. If you decide you want one of these be sure to set up a throw-away email address lest your mailbox be filled with spam."
1,"Works great, poorly made","This is my second Grossan. I love it for what it does, and it works great,....when it works. Like a previous reviewer said, mine started leaking, and now the motor barely works. This happened with the one before, as well. It's a shame because it's a great product in theory. Hopefully they will work out the kinks. I won't be purchasing another one. I refuse to give any more money to a company putting out machinery of such poor quality. And I think they know this is an issue, hence the one year warranty."
2,great while it lasted,But is didn't last a year and now it dribbles. I kept it clean as instructed. I tossed it and am looking for something better.
5,Great for high pollen area allergy relief,Where we live is know for causing a lot of allergy problems. This device has pretty much replaced taking over the counter allergy medications. Be sure to be careful in what you use in the saline solution.
4,Good product for simple congestion,I have to admit that I was not aware that you could run water up one nostril have it go through your nasal cavity and come out the other nostrial. I guess I should have paid closer attention in anatomy. My son and I suffer from simple congestion that is not easily remedied by blowing our noses. This product really help simply clear up our nasal passage for easier breathing. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
3,It'll clear your nose,"I originally bought this hoping it could flush out a tonsillolith in the back of my throat, but no such luck.Still, I found it useful shortly after having a nosebleed to get the clot out of my sinuses so it doesn't dry out, and get painful. It'll definitely help you if you get a lot of stuff stuck and turning into hard dry masses up there. It seems like it would help prevent embarassing ""you've got something in your nose"" moments if you used it beforehand.My only complaints about the machine are that the power cord is a bit short and it's a little loud."
4,Great. Arrived promptly and works well.,The product arrived promptly and works well just like the last one. I have no complaints.I recommend this to other people with nasal allergies.
3,It's good until it breaks.,"It's a great product. I haven't had a sinus infection after using it (and I used to get them at least once a month).However, the attachment broke inside of the nozzle after just 4 months.Masking tape works well if you find this happens to you."
2,Does not cure sinus problems,"I've had mine over a year. It seems to still be running fine. I do rinse it with tap water to get the salt out each time. After using this for about 6 months, I still needed sinus surgery. I believe that the real value of this machine is one, consistant flow of water through the sinus area. Two, it delivers 16 ounces of water versus 8 ounces for just about everything else on the market. I don't know that the pulses do anything. I would buy this again and I would normally rate this a 4 start, but I give it a 2 star as a caution to those hoping it will cure you. It won't."
3,Works great...until it fails.,"I'm a severe allergy sufferer. Among many RX allergy medications, I use this product daily to clean out my nasal passages. I find it to be one of the best natural solutions to alleviate my symptoms. However, this is my 2nd one that has failed. The first lasted 1.5 years, and this one has lasted about the same amount of time. I don't believe this is my fault as I follow the cleaning instructions after each daily use (pure water rinse without salt to clean the system). At $97 a pop, I'm not going to continue to buy this product every year and a half."
4,The Best Non-Medical Product Available for Sinus Problems,"Without a doubt, this is the best available non-medical product for sinus problems I've found. I've used it for years, twice a day, and it has improved the qualify of my life.That said, there are problems with the equipment. It is rather cheaply made(considering the cost), so parts are subjet to damage and the pump will eventually die because of the salt rusting the engine. You can extend the life of the machine by running clear water (I recommend a whole reservoir of water after each use) through the system to remove the salt buildup and rusting. Additonally, using vinegar also assists in removing salt deposits.Considering the benefit I receive from the use of this machine, I would be willing to spend more money for it, if the manufacture would use better parts and treat the machine parts to prevent the rust and salt bulidup.If it wasn't for these limitations, I would have given this product five stars."
3,Good alternative to neti pot,"I like the pulsating action of this product but I don't think the $100 price tag is worth it when you can use a much cheaper neti pot and get simular results. I will say though that if the neti pot doesn't work for you that the Hydro Pulse would be a great product to to use. I use the neti pot every day and the Hydro Pulse twice weekly. The Hydro Pulse may clean alittle deeper than the neti pot. I've got bad sinuses (two surgerys and 20 years of chronic sinus pain) so I use the two methods. So far both work good. And just a note for my fellow sinus sufferers if you use the neti pot there are ""advanced"" neti pot techniques. Look under yoga or neti pot nasal irrigation techniques on the internet."
3,Lacks Longevity,"I am a convert to the idea of nasal irrigation, having previously used a waterpik with a nasal adapter for several years. There is no question that nasal irrigation can alleviate sinus problems. I decided to try the Grossan Nasal Irrigation System and found the pulsation an improvement over the waterpik. The Grossan provides more control over the strength of the stream of water. HOWEVER, my Grossan began to link around the 8th month of use and completely failed 29 days after the one year warranty. Considering that the Grossan is close to $100, I can't recommend it. It is too expensive when it fails in so short a time. Another reviewer mentioned that he had gone through two Grossans in a relatively short period of time. I took the Grossan apart after it failed to see if there was any way I could fix it. The motor is not well protected from any water seepage which suggests to me that once it begins to leak through the bottom, its days are limited."
1,"Works, but is the cheapest, worst made piece of junk I have ever owned.","This thing works great. It clears out the stuff in your sinuses and has been the only thing that brings me relief from sinus congestion.That being said, it is, without a doubt, the cheapest piece of junk I have ever owned. And I've owned FOUR of these puppies. I've never had one last more than a year, and yes I follow all the instructions, using distilled water and flushing the system out after use. At $100 a pop, that gets expensive.They inevitably start leaking all over the place, and once that happens, the motor burn-out will occur shortly after. I never would have bought more than 2 if I wasn't so desparate for it.There appear to be other nasal irrigators on the market now. I have not tried them, but after throwing $400 at the Grossan over the last 4 years, I am going to try something different.So to sum it, it works well, but is almost guaranteed to fail on you with any kind of regular use. Be prepared."
4,This thing works,"I bought this unit on the recommendation of a friend who said this helped her two sons, her husband and herself with sinus problems. I think it works and is helpful in keeping the sinuses clean and germ free. I was having sinus problems with frequent colds. Since using this unit those things have cleared up and no colds. Sometimes it is just a little uncomfortable when you start but if you relax and breath through your mouth it is comfortable. I gave it 4 stars because you need to use it with a solution they sell and that stuff adds up quickly adding to its overall cost in the long run. i tried using it with a saline solution or just water and I don't think it works as good. Oh one hint when using it, don't turn your head side ways. Stay bent over the sink with you looking at the drain of the sink."
1,"Relieves my sinus infections, but has a short lifespan","I have owned 3 of them during the past 6 years. They worked wonders in relieving my sinue infections without having to go to the doctor for anti-biotics. However, they barely make it through the 2 years without breaking down. At this price, I would expect it to last longer. I will not buy anymore because of this. I plan on using my netti-pot instead."
4,Instant Gratification: Candles,"The book was good, wish it had more soy information which is what I was looking for. But all in all, it was worth it."
5,Beautiful music beautiful soul!,His voice is pure and clear and his songs are superb and meaningful!I suggest his other cd's even more!
2,very disappointed and way too much $ for what it is,Have numerous empty wrappers in my bag and candy is hard and does not seem fresh. Seems like way to much money for what I ended up with. I guess I should have checked our local stores first I could buy the same amount for less than half of the price I paid. Was gong to ship item back but the cheapest shipping to return it was over $8.00. Live and learn.
4,Big Bag!,"no problems with this purchase at all, its a very big bag of candy and none are stale like previous commenters had described. The only thing that i will add and i really think they should put this in their description is that it comes in an un-factory sealed bag, for me this was not a problem, but im sure that their are alot of people out their that feel differently. My reason for understanding is i can only find these candy's in bags mixed with all sorts of different candy's. assuming that this is the case, their is no such product available with just these little flavored tootsies factory sealed from the tootsie factory."
2,stale candy,I contacted this company regarding a recent purchase because I was unsatisfied. I ordered some flavored tootsie rolls - although I was happy with the shipping the quality was lacking. It was a 3 lb. bag and all of the candy was hard/stale. I emailed the company directly and was granted no response. I would not recommend this company.
1,Not getting what you pay for!,"In late 2006 and early 2007, Hauppauge began selling WinTV-PVR 150 cards that actually contained Hauppauge's new HVR-1600 card. No details of this switch were shown on the external package, however, an internal note explains that the switch was due to an ""excess of demand during the holiday season"". Although the new card might be considered an upgrade by some users, the switch breaks Linux support under the ivtv project, rendering the device useless for users interested in a ""free"" homebrew PVR project such as MythTV. Additionally, such practices are generally considered illegal, as they constitute a form of bait-and-switch advertising.I paid for a pvr-150 and thats not what came inside the box!I will be getting an RMA for this and probably reordering a PVR-350"
2,Haven't actually gotten my real WinTV-PVR-150 yet,"No, it's not Amazon. Amazon sent me what they thought was a real PVR-150, since Hauppauge says so on the box. However, it has another card in the box. Fine, it's a better card, but not what I need. So I send it back to Hauppauge to get a real PVR-150. That was like 3 weeks ago. WHERE IS MY DAMN CARD?!?!?"
4,Pleased with purchase,"After reading A LOT of reviews from many different sites on different tuners, I went with the Hauppauge PVR-150 (bought two). I was alittle nervous about what the picture quality would be like as I had the WinTV Go Plus and it was not that great.I am extremely satisfied with the picture quality of the tuner. They work great with Beyond TV. I use one to control my cable box. (great feature)As for the software that comes with the tuner, it worked when I installed the first tuner. After installing the second, it no longer worked. I did SEVERAL uninstalls/reinstalls to see if I could get it to work. No success.However, as stated above, I use the tuners with Beyond TV from Snapstream. Now I have a dual dvr on my computer and I'm happy.Thanks!"
