5,Best of the lot!,"My wife and I have watched many police procedural series over the years. It is perhaps our favorite genre. I have to say that for depth of character, for developing sympathetic interest, for intrigue and suspense, this series is superior to all the others. Who would have thought a ""single case"" police procedural could sustain the interest as this one has done? What will they do after solving this case? I hope they find a new case and the series continues!"
3,thank God it's finally over,"Good story but series dragged out too long. Two lead roles were ""mumblers"" - closed captioning would have been helpful. Does the sun ever shine in Seattle?"
4,The Killing is worth watching,"Great show, it got a little slow at times but it had a very unexpected ending!! Hopefully there will be a season 3."
4,great cast,"It is refreshing to watch a show in which the characters look real. The actors are all excellent, especially Ms. Enos & Mr. Campbell. Too bad this series will not continue."
5,I really loved this series,Was in a panic because I totally missed Season 2. Don't know how it happened. Really enjoyed this series. Wish they would bring it back. I hear it was cancelled. Had no suspicions about the ending. I like the actors in this series as well.
5,Still Great.,"oh my gosh, I am going to die if we do not solve this soon. Each week I am forced to wait 7 more days to find out the next bit of info. Clearly the mayor has a young girl fetish. Is it him. Or the father of ex girlfriend of the running mate. I think its the dad."
3,"Entertaining, and irritating","Good performances by the excellent cast, but I found myself losing patience with the characters, especially Sarah who's moody silences and long stares make me want to slap her. Then there's the incessant rain... It is Seattle but please, enough already. Overall it's an entertaining show, but I'm not totally hooked."
3,Plot takes twists and turns,"I keep watching although the second season is not so far as compelling as the first. The incessant twists and turnsas new suspects are discovered could get tedious, but the acting is quite good and the plot still holds my attention. Thisprobably rates 3 1/2 stars."
3,Good for when you have nothing else to do,"This was a interesting series. Going thru two seasons to find a killer was a little long. They probably could have wrapped up the series in one year. Some plot lines just got lost along the way and barely resurfaced. A few twist at the end were interesting but they just seemed as if the were thrown in at the last minute. If you have nothing better to do, this is not bad to watch. Do they ever have sunny days in Settle? After watching this series I know it one place I'll never visit."
4,Hooked,"I hate paying for streaming since I already subscribe to Hulu and Netflix....but...after getting totally hooked on Season 1 on Netflix, I couldn't wait for season 2, so I am working my way through Amazon's stream. I am not as engaged as I was, but I still can't stop watching. I am on episode 7, so far."
5,The killing 2,Great follow thru - hope there is a third season - love 2 main characters - personal issues makes them real and resilient
5,amazing all the way to the finish,The characters are intense. The political drama is intense. The suspense is great. The end is still a surprise. Don't miss it.
5,"""The Killing"" ROCKS","You MUST buy Season 2 of ""The Killing."" It's inexpensive, way cheaper than going to the movies, and is an extraordinarily smart and suspenseful show. The best ""whodunit"" ever! I am sad now that I finished it. And it is so easy and convenient to watch through Amazon--just sit anywhere in your house and turn the lights off!"
3,Story moving too slowly now,"Overall, I still like this series, and I'm still following it. It's well made, e.g., characters, settings, cinematography, music, etc. However, it's going too slowly now. Also, Linden has developed into an impersonal OCD nutcase. Her character started out likable, but no longer is. Holder is a likable character, though his tweaker side stretches reality for a cop."
1,i never got it to work on my pc. so was unable to watch this.,"I was never able to get it to come up and play on my pc. So, i cant really give a good or bad review on the video."
5,I need to catch up on my sleep!,"Riveting . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .[Amazon obviously doesn't believe that brevity is the soul of wit and says I have to put in more words before I can submit my pithy review; so here goes: ""Now is the time for all good men to go to the aid of the party."" Ah! that does it.]"
4,Great Series - too bad it was cancelled,The Amazon video streaming service was flawless via the Roku. The program was one of the better TV dramas produced. Hope it shows up on another network.
4,Definite must see,"Great series, almost as good as 1st season, keeps you guessing as to who done it. I hope a 3rd season comes together."
4,Still good,"Great acting from the two main characters esp. since Holder is Scandinavian, his American accent is great. I hope they do a third season."
4,Great episode!,"The owner of the tattoo in the video is revealed and leads the team on another dead end path. Stan's history is revealed, and it's not pretty. Since Richmond had a life changing event he is faced with what to do about his campaign, luckily he stays in the race."
4,Compelling,"My wife left the country for a few weeks, so I thought I would waste a little time with some mindless entertainment. How surprised I was to encounter this gripping drama. Like a good novel, you won't want to go to bed, but keep watching chapter after chapter. After an initial distate for the Stephen Holder character, he became my favorite."
5,Always a plot twist,"This show keeps you guessing. My only complaint is that, being a Seattle native, I know that it doesn't rain constantly as they portray it."
4,Wonderful,"I really enjoy this show, the cast is great. It is slightly predictable, though a truly entertaining show to watch."
5,Love this show!,Never a dull moment and lots of twists and turns to keep most viewers on the edge of their seats. Cannot wait for the next season. Writing and acting is very good.
5,Brilliant!,"The story resists stereotypes and presents one of the most complicated female leads ever depicted. Too rich for AMC! And the cancellation of this beautifully designed and played series is so disappointing. What's amazing about the focus here is how the effect of a murder on everyone in the lives of both the victim and killer is meticulously traced. (And yes, Seattle looks like this, feels like this.) Nothing commercial or slick about The Killing - nothing easily solved. Very intelligent series that shows what tv can do - and risks for doing."
5,seasons 1 and 2,"This was a great series. It kept me guessing who the killer was up to the last episode. To me, having the crime solved in two seasons was just the right amount of time. It gave you enough time to try to solve the crime without dragging it out too long and risk becoming boring. It would have been nice if both detectives could have continued with another crime, but since the female detective was portrayed as such a terrible mom, I thought it best that it ended the way that it did."
4,The Killing,"The series is a little slow at times, overall I enjoyed the series. I can't wait to hear if, when & where Season 3 will air."
2,not completed now for 1 1/2 seasons,murder mystery with no end in 1 1/2 seasons. where is Danish version. i would rent it maybe some day
5,Best new show in ages.,"Great cast, great writing, great suspense. The story line is compelling and actually makes sense. Also this show looks different than anything else on TV,"
2,Ugh,"First season awesome, second season the exact opposite. Just watch it to find the killer, otherwise don't waste you time."
5,Completely addicted,"I can't wait for each episode to download--it's gripped me at the core. Remarkable acting, great music, scary cinematography and I have to know WHO DONE IT!"
5,Great series,"I watched the first season on Netflix and got hooked. I wish the second season had been on there too, but I had to pay for it. For someone who doesn't watch much TV to begin with and am so cheap that I ditched cable it must say something that I was willing to pay for this one season."
3,Some very good. Some not so good,"While the second half of season two had some very good episodes, overall this series disappointed. It seems like the writers just ran out of ideas to further the plot. The two leads through were superb througout."
3,I really was hooked but.....,"OK, something better happen soon. I'm hoping the next episode resolves this feeling that I am wasting my time.Let's get going here. Though I really enjoy the acting, and the initial character building, many of the back stories are adding nothing to the story. One more episode...speed it up, or I'm out."
3,Ehh. Not the best,Detectives continue to gain evidence and new information about Rosie and her past. Mitch meets a girl that is the same as her daughter was and tries to take her under her wing. If you're looking for any episode to skip this season this is it.
5,Another Wonderful Episode,"Richmond returns to his roots, Sarah is forced into a psychiatric ward due to her obsessions - a lot of her past is revealed. Great back story on her character. Any suspicions about Holder are answered. Another great episode for the series leading up to what I like to think of a three-episode series finale."
3,I must have subtitles due to a hearing problem. Season 2 doesnt have them.,"I loved Season 1! I bought the disk with the complete season, which did have subtitles, and enjoyed every episode. Imagine my dismay as I prepared to order S2 E1from Amazon and discovered close captioning is not available. Now I have to wait for the DVD I guess. Strange thing is all episodes of Revenge Season 2 have close captioning. At least I can enjoy that. As for The Killing itself, I'm sure it will be at least as good as Season 1 which was great."
4,Really liked it - hope they have a Season Three,"I loved Season One so much, I finally went out and purchased Season Two on my I-Pad through Amazon. I couldn't wait for Season Two on Netflix. Watching on the I-Pad is not the same as watching on a great LED HD TV (which is what my TV's are). I thought Season Two was good, but not as good as Season One. However, it might have something to do with watching it on a smaller screen. I probably could have gotten the Amazon on my Samsung Smart TV, but couldn't seem to find it.I loved the photography and production in Season One - being another Swedish production, I really appreciated the approach to the photography, music, etc. It reminded me of the artistic quality of The Dragon Tattoo films. I didn't notice this as much in Season Two, but again I attribute that to the small screen.Hope they come out with a Season Three - yeah Fox if you pick it up!"
3,carefully read what you are getting here....,"This book is well written. It provides good info to a limited extent for KIDS....If I were in grade school, this book is perfect for a report in class... for KIDS....I was careless. I didn't read the info about this book well enough to realize the age factor in the writing of the book.So, when you think you want to purchase this book...and you think you will get an adult version in how and what the author is writing about..... DON'T!!! THIS IS A KID'S BOOK!!!!!Otherwise...I can't say too much negative about it."
3,no ants,I thought I would be able to order the ants right away but what they don't tell you is that the ants won't be available until spring and there is a charge for the ants. This should be made obvious on the box and in theadvertising.
5,Lonesome Dove Erupt,"We must combine the toughness of the serpent and the softness of the dove, a tough mind and a tender heart. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. -- I believe Sir Hubbard embodies the kind and eloquent ferocity represented by Dr. King's statement. My exposure to Freddie Hubbard was minimal until a recent trip to Seattle where a good, old friend of mine once again steered me in the right musical direction with an ethereal introduction to Live at Fat Tuesdays. Just check it out. You might never feel a trumpet the same way again..."
4,procede with caution,"This book is for those learned folk with insight into personality disorders--personally I think it is a too much information for a layperson, however it is very detailed in the insight it provides. I liken it unto a person reading about an appendectomy then attempting to perform one. That being said, the book is a must have for any one in the mental health field. It explains the motivations behind the madness and gives the readers tools to use to deal with the individual suffering the disorder. Ultimately though, I think that the book will provide a beneficial base for the lay person to use to start developing an understanding of the fatal flaws, but it is not a replacement for the appropriate professional intervention."
5,Fantastic; please release every season on DVD,"I vaguely remember watching Barnaby Jones as a child; couldn't wait to view this release. If you're a fan of retro TV, don't hesitate to buy. Great video quality, that haunting Jerry Goldsmith theme music, believable chemistry between Ebsen and Merriwether. Lots of great '70s guest stars, wonderful vintage LA sets and scenery, Barnaby's cool brown Crown Victoria. Are the plotlines a tad hokey and campy? Perhaps -- but Barnaby is much more than a doddering sleuth -- he's got a badass no-nonsense sarcasm with the perps, an easy rapport with 70s hipsters (He can ""dig"" rock music) and a gentlemanly dignity with everyone else. Storywise these classic crime dramas still have a trick or two up their sleeves and are a great panacea to the frenetic, hyper, violent, techno crime shows on network TV today. Not just for grandma!Please, don't make us wait years for subsequent seasons. I'd buy all eight at once given the chance."
4,Milk drinking PI,"What a great show! I love classic TV and got this for my Birthday from my mom. Loved Buddy Ebsen as Jed Clampett and have been wanting to see this show but it nobody has ever reran it inmy area. The pilot episode was great and can't wait to see the other shows. If you like classic Tv or detective shows, you will enjoy Barnaby Jones!!"
5,Nooooowwwww I get it!,"I was in Cracker Barrel a couple of weeks ago, and as usual, I always wander through the ""general store."" And usually when I look at the videos, I keep walking because they are so expensive. Well this time, I decided to buy.... I am so glad I did! I am 46 years old, so when this came out, I was really to young to understand what was going on,let alone to know the difference between cops and private eyes, hence the title of this review!! I found the price rather steep,but what the heck? You only live once. And since everything else on ""normal"" tv is garbage, I thought why not? So go ahead, don't be so stingy, and buy this DVD set!"
4,Very Good,"Vivanativa is one of the best rock groups in Puerto Rico, and probably the most fun and original. Their sound is unique and very good. They are the opening act for Ricky Martin in South America and Spain, but their music is just good rock and roll."
5,Extraordinary,"This book takes your breath away. The writing is so good that you simply cannot stop reading, even when the messages are sometimes hard to hear. If you enjoy nuanced writing, unique voices, or Jack London style adventure-tales, you will like this book. I heard about it just by chance on the radio, and picked it up only because I like wolves, so I was shocked when this (then) unknown book turned out to be the best read in years. I feel lucky to have stumbled onto this treasure and it remains one of my favorite books of all time."
2,Do I just not understand?,"This book, although filled with decent stories, should not have been given any best book awards. The only way I found to read it was to sit down and force myself to ignore the many grammar errors and short meaningless sentences. Maybe it is because I am spoiled with books by amazing authors, I'm not sure. I do not suggest this book to anyone unless you are interested in a random arrangement of stories with no conclusion. ""... the reader is allowed no escape into the fuzzy myth of the Arctic..."" Since when have there been fuzzy myths about the Arctic?"
4,Pretty good first novel and a good read.,"I liked this novel quite a lot but thought the writer lost his track about midway through and the novel could easily have lost 50 pages with good editing. And, I confess, I preferred father to the narrator son. I wanted to know about the origins of that family. It's an easy novel to like because the language is tasty and the subjects fascinating. I can't wait for Kantner's second and third novels which, likely, will be just about perfect."
2,Got Tundra?,"A slow moving tome, this story is hardly a story at all. It is more like a dysfunctional family's travelogue. While there are some interesting analogies and some incredibly descriptive passages, this book left me cold."
4,rugged beauty,i really loved this book - it takes the familiar coming of age story and spins it around a violently beautiful alaskan setting. it challenges the romantic version of alaska (and life in general) that many of us hold - at times this comes across in a harsh and piercing manner but in the end there is a sense of redemption. it will leave you thinking - and that is the best possible result of any book. :)
1,This book is not what it seems,"This title came up in a search on the keyword ""tattoo"". The cover illustration has some tattoos, and the introduction talks a bit about body modification, but the rest of the book has *nothing* to do with this subject. Still, they are marketing the book towards this audience. In addition, it is largely written in postmodern gobbledygook. I found it to be virtually unreadable."
4,Not what it seems but still very good,"I initially bought this book with the intention of using it for my research on tattooing and other forms of body modification. I was rather disappointed because this book only had one paragraph that actually addressed these issues. However I still found the book useful - the articles in it may not contain exactly what I expected but they were useful and inspiring nonetheless. Some of the ideas were a bit dated but that's just a sign of the book's age (it was published 19 years ago, in 1992). I quoted many of these ideas in my university essays - easy targets for some healthy criticism. In short: misleading title but definitely not a waste of money (in my case at least)."
1,what was this?,"I tried to keep an open mind about this, waiting to see where it was going. It didn't. You must have to be a true fan to like this crap. Perhaps live would be something else, but I was under the impression that this wold be funny. It wasn't."
4,Excellent Mega-Mix Track,"This CD contains three tracks: 1) 9 min. Mega-Mix, 2) 3 min. mix, and 3) Slice me nice single track. The Mega-Mix is the highlight - nice mix of top Fancy hits."
2,Never Judge and e-book by it's cover,"I use the Al-Anon Courage to Change book on a daily basis and thought it would be great to have it on my Kindle. Unfortunately, when I downloaded it, it was not the same book but rather, a collection of bible readings assembled by Hazeldon. Very disappointing."
3,A Hard Read,I couldn't really get in to the style of this book. I guess it was not what I was expecting. It does have some very interesting information though.
5,Mud Dauber Screen,This item fit perfectly. It was simple to install and will protect my RV furnace from those pesky insects. I hope you will eventually sell the hot water tank screen and refrigerator screens. Thanks
4,Pleased,"I was pleasantly surprised with the condition of this book, as it is only slightly used, with no marks that I can see, even though I selected an option that indicated it to be in rougher shape. It arrived about 12 days after ordering. Very happy to be able to replace a lost cookbook :)"
3,Ms. Braxton and Kenny G,"Toni Braxton does it again. Her fourth single from her Secrets album is a fine composition. This time she is accompanied by her Arista label-mate Kenny G. ""How Could An Angel Break My Heart"" is a beautiful ballad written and produced by Babyface. The song displays her sultry vocals which we have grown to love over the years. A must have!"
3,Not as good as the Gladiator soundtrack...,"... but it was pretty decent. I, too, was disappointed that the song playing during the King's death scene, entitled ""Vide Cor Meum"", was not included. It's one of my favorites. FYI: it can be found on the Hannibal soundtrack, for which, I believe, it was originally scored."
5,Kingdom of Heaven,Awsome movie. Makes you want to do research on that time period. Highly recommend.
4,Great score,"Gregson-Williams is no Hans Zimmer, but he's working his way there. The score is perfect for the movie; however, like much of John Williams's work, it loses something when taken away from its context.This is not intended to be judgmental but descriptive. Scores that can stand on their own, without the cinematographic context, are difficult to write, I'm sure. One classic example is Vangelis's soundtrack for Ridley Scott's ""1492"", which I purchased and continue to play and enjoy, though I have yet to watch the movie itself-mainly because I can't bear Gerard Gepardieu.I don't regret buying this score; it's worth every cent I paid. It's just not one of the 'greats'.Till NoeverAuthor: KEAEN, SELADIENNA, CONTINUITY SLIPowlglass.com"
3,GOOD CHORAL MUSIC SHUFFLED WITH ACTION/WARRING/PERCUSSION IS VERY DISCONCERTING CACOPHONY . . .,"I have Kingdom of Heaven in BluRay, the four-disk Director's Cut and this soundtrack. Like, I really think the movie is magnificent. The sound track is another matter. It's a mix of percussive drums, battle bashings and, what I do appreciate,Mid-Eastern music with some choral chants and background - 'spiritual' music, both of which are fine for easy listening while reading or meditating.But the harsh mix of fight action and the meditative music is jarring.Great movie though; buy the Director's Cut 4-disk set; good prices now..."
4,Good Soundtrack Worth Owning,"Let me state up front, that I have yet to see the movie. I bought the soundtrack based upon the soundclips. I have really enjoyed this one. There was one song that could have been inserted onto the Chronicles of Narnia cd and no one would have thought it out of place.Another song, Wall Breached, that could have been expounded on, but feels short. I am sure that this is because of the action of the movie, but I still wish that it would have been developed into something bigger.Overall though, I am very pleased with the cd."
3,"Of course, ""Vide Cor Meum"" is not on this CD...",...because it was composed for Scott's own HANNIBAL and can be found on that soundtrack!
3,Music from trailer is not on here.,"If you want it, look for the cd called The Prayer Cycle by Jonathan Elias. That contains the song you're looking for if you're hunting for that piece. This is frustrating and hasn't been the first time this has happened in theatrical trailers. Miller's Crossing theme was used in The Shawshank Redemption trailer, and a piece from the Bone Collector was used in the Gods and Generals trailer.Overall, Kingdom of Heaven lacks a five, or even four star review for its lacking in overall playability. The King is a song that certainly resonates, but the rest of this score seems to fall short of what I was expecting."
1,Unhappy customer...,"due to purchasing this CD, and, after listening to it (which rendered it unreturnable) discovered that the soundtrack is incomplete: specifically the counter-tenor sequence that plays when Sybilla comes to view Baldwins' body, is missing."
4,No so good....lacks Emotion.,"yes...technically is very good.But this score lacks emotion and feelings.I like the first minuts of wall wreached or better man.Coronation ,terms and battle of kerak have great stuff too.but whole score for me is cold,and if like harry try to do something very....complex and without any passion.Is my modest opinion.I am a harry gregson williams fan since borrowes.But i think Dramatic theme for spy game is much more dramatic than this whole score.I gave 4 stars because is very good in very aspects.Maybe is my taste...maybe i need see the picture.Maybe i need more action stuff today.maybe tomorrow i love this score.:P"
3,"Improvement in sound but its not ""Polished brass""","The finish chipped off when I opened the package. It looks like cheap gold spray paint and the picture is misleading. I give a three star rating because of the fact that it did improve tone, it sustains well now and I no longer need to plug in a compressor pedal. But like what the other reviewers said, sub-par finish."
2,Less than what I expected,"The bridge pins in the main picture should be the bridge pins you get. I got the all brass ones with no inlays sadly. They are supposed to be polished brass, but instead they have a cheap layer of gold paint on them that was already starting to flake off before I took them out of the package. The only good thing about these is they did improve brightness, and clarity somewhat."
2,Cheap gold plated brass,The cheap gold plated brass even chipped off before I open the packaging. The pin were lose to be started with. You have to really push the pins into the hold. I don't really know about the sound clarity but I am truly disappointed with the finishing of the product.
2,Looks Cheap,"Finish is wearing off. Looks cheap. I'll probably replace them with some ox bone pins. Not sure that the brass pins improved the sound much -- they might have, but then again, maybe I just heard what I was hoping to hear."
1,Terrible totally terrible,Do not buy this thing...! It overflows twice a week. I finally give up. Mr. Coffee has overflowed for the LAST time..I am off to buy another brand...anything else will do. Seriously.
1,don't try cleaning it either!!,"I thought i'd follow the directions of this coffee machine for once, to prolong it's life. I tried running vinegar through it to clean it, and the next time i go to make coffee, it doesn't do anything, doesn't heat up, doesn't make a sound, nothing! I had it maybe a month, and got it as a gift, thus, no receipt, i was definately not impressed!"
2,Shoddy,Have had the coffee maker for 2 weeks and the water dripper arm (spigot where the water drips from the resevoir) broke. Loved the timer feature on it though. Keep your receipt.
1,you all were right,"call me dumb for i didnt listen to you people, you were right this machine leaks so bad i can do the dishes except it has no hot water. for new customers thinking of buying this machine (DONT). i read the reviews and said to myself that the reviews cant be right, but they were right,right down to the last drip(on the counter). the only thing nice about this machine is the looks"
1,Problems with leaking & basket overflowing!!!,This is the second coffee maker of this type that I've bought from Mr. Coffee in the last 7 months. Both of them had problems with leaking and overflowing. I could never trust it enough to program it and leave it! Don't buy this machine (or any like it) unless you enjoy cleaning up messes and finding grounds in your coffee. I'm shopping around for another machine that ISN'T a Mr. Coffee.
2,This coffee maker leaks water,"I am on my third coffeemaker, and all three have leaked water from the resevoir. I am not happy at all but I have been living with it. I need to put a dish towel under the coffeemaker every time I use it."
2,Warm Coffee,"It sure looks like a nice, fully featured coffee maker, but with the first cup comes the disappointment. The coffee just isn't hot. No worrys about burning your tongue here. It does have an adjustible temperature heat plate, but by the time that gets your coffee up to normal temperature (on high), you have old hot coffee. I'll be returning it. By the way, it cost considerably more at Sears."
1,Fire Hazard - Not stocked for a reason,"I'll tell you why it's not being stocked or discontinued. It's because it's a fire hazard. I thought it was just me not being able to make coffee without spilling it all over. This item was not worthy of me even putting in my garage sale. It didn't do it at first, but after awhile, it started making coffee all over the counter. If that wasn't bad enough, it spilled coffee grounds all in my coffee when I tried to salvage the coffee. For awhile, we had to lean something against it to keep it from spilling everywhere. Finally, I bought a new one. It is a Mr. Coffee as well. It has a pouring problem. I think it is just their brand. I always grew up thinking Mr. Coffee was a decent brand, but I don't know if I will ever buy another pot from them again."
1,get a Krups,Don't do it - just don't. I wish I had listened to all the bad things I had heard about Mr Coffee...but no. Grounds go everywhere from overflo unless you seat the carafe just so (which requires pushing it in further than it rests naturally). Treat yourself: buy a Krups. I wish I had.
1,If I could rate less then 1 I would!,"I purchased this product in November of 2002, so in less then one year I have had to buy another coffee maker. Worse yet, I owned a Mr. Coffee before I purchased it and it too died! (Silly me for thinking that was a fluke) This paticular model had more problems then I am able to list with a maximum of 1000 words, however, the most prevalent were that it leaked, and after leaking enough, it rust stained my counter underneath the machine, the pour spout was poorly designed and in the end the heating element died. My advice, steer clear of this and any Mr. Coffee maker. Signed anxiously awaiting the arrival of my Bunn coffee maker!"
1,JAVIER SOLIS DOES NOT SING ON THIS CD!,"Do not buy this album if you expect to hear the masterful singing of Javier Solis. It is merely an album recorded in tribute to the great legend which easily falls short of its goal. Unfortunately, it is not made clear that someone else actually sings on this album. I felt cheated as one would when reaching for a cool, quenching glass of water and squirming in horror after finding out that it is vodka instead."
1,tramposos,"este cd. no es original, no sean tranzas ,no es ni la Sombra de Javier Solis, deberas que El loco o Payaso que invento el disco se fumo un cigarro de Hoja seca, ojala y hagan Cenizas el material. y como dice la cancion, ""Ese bolero no es mio""."
1,Rescatando al rey del bolero ranchero,"Estimados lectores, al entrar en esta página he descubierto, con desagrado, que el interprete de las melodías de este disco, no es Javier Solís, lo cual se puede distinguir por su voz que no tiene el timbre de seducción ni aterciopelada como la tenía el gran Javier. Por lo que no les recomiendo este disco, debido a que no es el rey del bolero ranchero el que canta (además de que hay canciones que Javier no cantaba, como ""tres regalos"", gracias."
2,Amazing Grace The Gathers,"The songs were great, but the track was too slow, they sounded like the words were sung by tired people. Gave one as a gift also and the lady felt the same way. I have over 20 Gather CD's and this is the first I didn't really enjoy."
5,A Trip into the Culture of Sameness,No Elbow Room is a quick and informative read into the Cultural mind set of Japanese relationships. It opens up for examination a world of contradicting correctness and sheds light on some of my own experiences in Japan. You will read it from cover to cover enjoying the wonderful illustrations and lighthearted humor.
1,Absolutely WORTHLESS,This thing is so worthless: you can't even hear the water--which is why you buy it. This is the absolutely WORST water feature I have bought!
5,Wonderful starter set!!!,"I don't know how we ever survived in the kitchen without this handy set. We have used every item multiple times--even the parts we never thought we'd use! The price is terrific, too, for a gift for newlyweds or recent grads just leaving home. They'll appreciate it for certain."
5,It's simple---buy it!,"How THIS album doesn't stay in print is beyond me. After doing time w/the Arc Angels, Doyle II surprised everyone with this very solid debut. For those expecting Arc Angels part 2 they'll be surprised but not disappointed. Layers of guitars (without being overdone), great arrangements, really solid songs and of course Doyle's soulful voice. After listening to this, you can see why Clapton himself asked Doyle, ""WHY aren't you more well known in the U.S.??"" Easily one of the best releases in 1996 and certainly the most overlooked thanks to Geffen Records essentially ignoring Doyle. Buy it! I've turned many a friend on to this one."
4,Provides some good information but not very in-depth,"What information this book does have is very well-organized, clearcut, easy to understand. Not very unique information nor in depth. A decent introductory book but not good to have if you already have or plan on buying other good books on diabetes. Too many of what would have been helpful sections spend a page or two basically telling you to consult your insurance, your dietician or other sources--I'd say more than 1/3 of the book doesn't really contain information."
4,Well covered,"Very good display of Kata, including showing an above view, would recommend to anyone starting out.My only reason for dropping a star would be the sound quality, the drumming was at sometimes quite annoying"
4,One Reason 1978 was a Good Year,"Walking the Perfect Square evokes the late 70's in New York City, and I mean the real city as only a real ""five-borough"" New Yorker can know it. What makes the main character, Moe Praeger, so compelling is his intensity of desire -- for a solution, for the truth, and for thin-lipped tough Catholic girls. Reed Farrel Coleman commits no technical fouls weaving his intricate plot to this reader's immense narrative satisfaction and delight. I look forward to more."
3,An average crime novel,"I read this book based on a recommendation from a bookstore employee who knows I like George Pelecanos' work. And, I guess Coleman's work shares the feature of using a regular physical location - Brooklyn in his books, Washington, D.C. for Pelecanos, and they both write crime novels. But, that's about as close as they get, in my opinion and based on this book. Pelecanos' work is major league level and this is maybe AA level minor leagues. Not bad, but also not really worth the reading time.I think it's an average book. If you have a hard time finding enough good quality material, you might consider this book. Otherwise, I'd recommend sticking with the stronger writers - Pelecanos, Turow, Lehane, Connelly, etc."
4,First Exposure,This was my first exposure to the author. He reminds me of John Connally with the introspective main character. Certainly will be buying more books.
3,Just Okay,"This wasn't a bad book, nor was it a good book. It was just....a book. Interesting, but not riveting. I thought the plot was kind of weird and kind of intricate. In fact, it was too intricate for the strength of the plot. On the other hand, the descriptions of places were good, Moe Praeger is an okay protagonist, there's a lot of tough-guy lines in the book and generally good dialog. I guess I like books a little more fast-moving and intense. I'll give it three stars."
5,informative,"This documentary was all a documentary should be. Informative, insightful, educational and thought provoking. I would have liked it to be more ""up to date"", i.e. what's happening in the years 2000-2006 on the abortion subject/legislation. Good piece of history; fanatacism that exists right here in the USofA. We need not be concerned with others' jihad against us. This documentary shows it's Us against Us. Will we collapse from within?"
4,Junie B. Jones should not be taken as Shakespeare!,"Both of my children have grown up with Junie B. Jones. I am a certified elementary school teacher, and I get as much joy from Junie B. Jones as my kids do. We all laugh at her, and we all talk about how much trouble they would get into if they did the things that Junie B. Jones does. Children understand that Junie B. Jones is a character in a story. Children understand that the things she does are wrong. We should all be happy that Barbara Park has created a character who has inspired so many children to want to read! Afterall, isn't that the goal? We should get down off of our pedastools and realize that this is not Shakespeare or rocket science, and we are not going to create any criminals from reading about Junie B. Jones. What we will create are READERS."
2,I'd hate to see Junie B. Jones as a teenager.,"I've taught many a child who is like Junie and almost all of them grow up to be mouthy, pushy and obnoxious. I just don't see this as being a good series for kids. I'm not as bothered by the bad grammar as some folks are, but I am bothered by her lack of ability to know the right way to act or foresee the consequences of her actions."
3,"Good, funny","I like this book. If u are thinking about getting this book, get it! So, so,so funny!!!!! I need Junie B.!!!"
1,BEWARE.,"Sure, it's a fun read, but I agree with the other reviewers on this board who rated the series conservatively--- it is FULL of grammatical errors. Read the review by Gregory J. Nelson, directly below mine... beginning readers learn English through exposure to it. Exposure to BAD English is not doing them any good...especially when their environments provide enough incorrect examples for them.Now, if you want to read this with your child as an ""easy"" read that's fun which you know is not going to ""challenge"" them, then going through and helping them to point out all its faults is a creative way of exposing them to more of an ""everyday pace"" of writing and getting them to proofread without them realizing it.If used as a teaching tool, there's a lot to be learned, but don't leave your kid alone with this book thinking they'll get something from it, because you don't want them to have what it's got to give."
5,Junie B. Jones Collections,"A very delightful series especially for my Grandchild's eagerness to read, read, read!!!"
5,So so funny...,"This book should be required reading for all females.. it is so authentic. And so funny, I read it to my grandchildren and I was laughing until tears ran down my cheeks... Barbara Park has created a wonderful presence in Junie B."
2,Not the kind of book I would want my 6 years old to read,"This is definitely my 1st review towards anything so negative about anything. I have to admit the story of the book is quite funny and it's very lively for 6 years old to follow and be interested to read on. However I have to agree with other reviewers who think the book is using grammatically incorrect or even words that doesn't exist (e.g. bajillion) and as well as some words I prefer not seeing in the book (e.g. darn thing). Anyway it's probably something I won't mind my daughter reading since she will one day be exposed to these words and hearing verbal conversation about it but I was pleasantly happy when she told me ""darn thing"" was not a nice word to say. Lastly Junie B Jones is not a modest character that I want my daughter to portray in. She's all about me me me."
5,Big laughs and bigger lessons!,"How should you behave is somebody gets something that you wanted for yourself? Well, you sure shouldn't wish on a star for them to get sick, like Junie does.Junie B. Jones is (almost) a Flower Girl is one of the best of Barbara Park's books. The irrepressible kindergartner is, once again, filled with misconceptions and in need of some good correction in her behavior.Parents and children will roar with laughter at her exploits, and talk about how things really should be done!Recommended!"
3,Meh... Pass.,"Not my favorite anime I've watched lately. If I had to choose between Ninja Cadets andSamurai - Hunt for the Sword, I'd choose Samurai. If I had to choose between Samurai: Hunt for the Sword andWrath of Ninja, I'd choose Wrath. If I were rich and had my way, I'd probably go with Ninja ScrollThe Movie&The Series - Ultimate Collection.But, for what it's worth, I wasn't a big fan of Ninja Cadets. The trailer I saw seemed to be better than the anime. I hoped for more. If you've seen one of the ""cinematic"" trailers, it's mostly from a short scene at the beginning. The rest seemed cartoonish, whiny and incomplete (almost like they hoped to turn it into a series, but never got that far; no resolution really, it just seems to end). Go for Samurai: Hunt for the Sword or Wrath of the Ninja over this one. If you've got the money, buy Ninja Scroll or Samurai X instead."
4,This DVD has everything - including subtitles,"I just wanted to make a correction in my last review, the dvd version DOES have english subtitles and japanese language mode (I feel so dumb, I found it by accident). I was confused because NOTHING on the package suggested more than one language mode. This feature is very important for die-hard anime fans like myself. That's one reason I'll never get the Street Fighter II movie on DVD, beause it doesn't have the english subtitles version (because it was never officially commercially released in that format). Anyhoo I strongly recommend this DVD."
4,Beauty and the Beast accompaniment,"If you are a huge fan of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and want to sing instrumental tracks from the show, this will do the trick. I bought this because I really needed an instrumental track of ""If I Can't Love Her"" and the version here, is beautiful! I do wish this CD had the reprise of ""If I Can't Love Her"" as well as others, but overall, it's really good. The instrumental tracks are great and vocalists, particularly the girl who does Belle is really good."
1,Not what it seems to be...don't waste your money,"This CD says ""complete tracks"" however, cuts are made to many of the songs. ""Be Our Guest"" is cut by almost 2 minutes, and ""Gaston"" is cut by at least a minute or so. If you just want to sing for enjoyment it might be OK, although some of the music sounds like you are at the circus.If you want to use this as a rehearsal recording for a musical performance, forget it!It does not match the orginal score and many of the instrumental parts are cut out. The singing demos are pretty awful too!"
4,toni b. - love affair,i diddent knew she released this song as a single... its a great song.does someone have an picture from it?
3,Plastic Dip,"I like it, but I hate the container it's in. I bought it and a week later it dried up because that container doesn't seal properly. Other than that it's good, you can put a rubber grip on anything."
3,"not bad, not good","This is ok, but does not brush on as easy as they say, kinda like thick paint, not THAT easy to use, think I would rather use paint on bigger items! great for pliers and tools and such!"
5,Great school book,"I would recommend this title to anyone looking to read a book that is a bit different than most literature. I read this book for school while others had to read ""The Joy Luck Club."" I was a bit upset at first, but after reading the first 3 pages I was hooked. The book was extremely interesting,and I'm only in high school. If an author can write an educational yet entertaining book then they are amazing. More writers should take a page from his book.(See what I did there?)"
4,Railway Workers United in 1940's French West Africa,"""God's Bits of Wood"" is a well written novel about a 1947 strike on the Dakar-Niger railway (a real historical event). The story is seen through the eyes of the workers, their families, and railway management. Sembene Ousmane is both a novelist and film director, and his writing style might be called cinematic. Even in translation, this is a vivid depiction of Senegal (its various ethnic groups and their cultures), colonial Africa, and a struggle for worker's rights."
5,Classic,"I don't usually listen to this type of music, but I'm glad I picked up this album. It is a classic. Get in on this now before they blow up so you can truthfully say that you liked them from the beginning."
5,Some Excellent Hidden Gems,"This is a great hidden gem from Devendra. The extended version of ""I Feel Just Like A Child"" is an interesting take, feeling like you're set in an old time saloon. ""Stewed Bark Of An Old Tree"" and ""Shame"" were the two that really got me though. Those two alone give you just that right amount of Cripple Crow quiver goodness you may have been searching for."
3,Handy organizer- good worktop for sofa and car trips,"Its rather bulky and unweildy to use for carrying it to work etc. The work surface concept is the plus to this unit. Its quite nifty for keeping all the additional things together at home and makes a good unit to work from for the car on trips. A shoulder strap that could be removed would be a big plus as that hand hole is fine for home but not too convenient when you're carting a lot of things around. I keep my netbook in a little sleeve with a pocket-most of the time its all I need. Then I keep the rest of the stuff...the ac adapter, portable mini dvd, cords, media etc in a little courier sort of carrier bag w strap. It can go sort of crammed in my other rolling carrier. I find this case best for keeping parts together and providing a nice work surface. I thought the orange would be loud but you really don't notice it."
4,"Also Fits the 17"" MacBook Pro","I love how this laptop case is not only unique, it's functional as well. You can use your laptop and still keep it in this case to prevent the heat from burning your thighs. Even though the specs says for up to 15"" laptops, it also fits the 17"" MacBook Pros if you position it a specific way while you zip. It becomes a habit after a while. The sturdy material is also great protection when you're on the go.My only caveat is that I wish that it came with an optional shoulder strap."
3,pocettop belken case,well first off my 15.4 laptopbarley fits in the case. its a very tight fit.it barley closes. im afraid the zipperis going to break.poor design i think.the power cord. thing is in the wrong place. for my laptop.im afraid its going to get pinched off. also the power cordcomes threw the top of the pocket top. not very pratical.i dont think i will be using it. for me it was a waste of money.because it will be in my junkpile.
1,the zipper doesnt work!,"i got the item for Christmas yesterday. Literally the first time I decided to use it, the zipper broke. It is not worth the money!!"
1,Save your money.,"Worthless is the word that comes to mind, the only word. If someone tries to give you this book, you would be better off to turn it down.I love books and have several on writing fiction. This is the only one that I plan to throw in the trash."
3,Not the best out there,I have owned this for about 2 years. No oomf or real power. Struggles through cookie dough. The end of the beater broke off at the weld site...time for a new mixer!
3,"good for cookies, not for egg whites or cream","I have had this mixer for several years, and it works really wonderfully for cookies and most other needs. Doesn't burn the motor out, or even heat up. Very easy to get the dough off the beaters.But I can't get it to really whip egg whites or whipped cream. They will eventually start to look right, but stay a bit on the runny side. I think the thin blades on the beaters just don't get enough air into the mixture.I'm thinking about just getting a cheap hand mixer with thicker blades just for cream and egg whites.I wish this mixer came with a whisk attachment or something -- then it would be perfect."
5,A 10 year WORKHORSE!,"Well, I certainly cook a lot and use my machines more than most people. I purchased this 3 speed KitchenAid hand mixer well over 10yrs ago and I have actually used it many times for tollhouse cookies and other stiff batters. The motor has stood the test of time and never burned out! The last few years I ugraded to a KitchenAid stand mixer and left my hand mixer for the finer art of cheesecakes and other lightweight tasks. If it were not for one of the beaters that keeps disengaging (something internal broke)I would still be singing its praises. Unfortunately, I have to replace it now because of the problem with the beater not staying locked in place....BUT I will invest in another similar unit. You really don't need tons of speeds or fancy digital settings....JUST A GOOD RELIABLE MACHINE that DOES what it is asked to do."
5,Great Mixer,"This mixer has really turned out to be a nice addition to the kitchen. It's stronger than ordinary mixers, as my husband uses it to mix cookie dough! A good little mixer for the money."
2,Pretty weak,"It held up okay for a while. Then it developed a problem with the plug. Then it developed a problem with the gears inside. Now one of the beaters came apart. I'm persistent but not that persistent.I thought maybe, just maybe, I was getting a hand mixer for the long term. I'm getting the Cuisinart to replace it."
1,Still Not Acceptable,"Dear Readers, this is my second missive about the Kitchenaid 3 speed hand mixer. Previously, I wrote and said that my new mixer was terribly underpowered and that I was hoping it was just a lemon. Well, I took it back to Target (they graciously refunded my money)and tried another one (same model). Unfortunately, it was just as underpowered as the first. I'm afraid KitchenAid has let us down big time. It used to be a terrific hand mixer. I, for one, am moving on and am in search of reviews of other brands. Good luck to us all."
1,The Flimsy Wimpy Mixer,This product is horrible!!! I have not had it very long and both the beaters are already broken. I did not even use it to make anything tough like cookie dough because it was so underpowered. Do not waste your time or your money on this.
3,georgia,"I have been a KitchenAid user for many years. They were a company still making products in the USA. Now even though their website says they are American made I find it not to be true. I purchased a new 5 speed hand mixer at Kohl's yesterday. On the back it has a sticker that says St. Joseph, Mi. That is where their company headquarters is I guess. On the bottom of white mixer etched in white (probably so it is hard to read) it says ""MADE IN CHINA"". I was very disappointed. Now I am trying to find a decent product by another company that might be made in the USA. So far, I have not found one. No wonder our country is in trouble."
1,low quality and high price,"I spent more on this mixer hoping for something that would last. The first or second time I mixed mashed potatoes, the gears stripped or something and it was stuck running. You had to plug, and unplug it to get it to turn off and on. My husband took it apart and was able to fix it, but has had to do it several times. It's high speed is equivalent to one of the lowest speeds on most $10 - $20 dollar mixers and it can't do whipping cream etc very well at all. Also, the wire beaters are cheep, the welding broke on one of mine. I am not hard on kitchen equipment, and have not even used these very much and will not buy kitchenaid again. Not worth it"
1,Quick burn out,"I used it for the second time today. The motor started putting off blue flame and then burnt out. I was putting on final touch on some already mashed potatoes, nothing difficult. Not what I expected from Kitchen Aid."
2,Just not good enough,"Pros:I like the design and overall size and appearance. Nice two tone..chrome top with brushed stainless sides. Good features and felt like a well made product.Cons:Took 3 minutes to toast bread. Twice as long as my old toaster. Maybe that's the way they make them now-a-days but I will look for a faster toaster.Also, the wells were not deep enough. The top of an average slice of bread did not get toasted.Comments:Perhaps I am expecting too much but I will continue to search for a product that fufills my needs and expectations.Sent it back to Joe Muscle/Amazon and am expecting a full refund including shipping. They Rock!!"
2,very disappointing,"When we first purchased this toaster, I loved the look and flexability - options for toast or bagels, defrost, melt the butter, warm it back up, and you could see exactly how much time remained until your toast was done. One year later, one side of the toaster no longer works at all. The other side only will toast for bagels, so your bread is toasted on one side and soft on the other. Have had several cheap $15 toasters that operated far more reliably. A real shame that the manufacturing operational standards weren't as high as the design standards. Very pretty, but save your money."
2,Iron What ? Maiden Who ?,Why do I feel Iron maiden should've changed their name to just Maiden after DiAnno left the band since he was the Iron in Maiden.wait whats Bruce doin on the cover of this release I found this dvd @ a local flea mrkt for $2.00 its not what I expected but it is Maiden in the early days in my opinion the 1st 2 maiden albums are their best no disrespect to Brucie but Dianno was the man.this dvd was put out by the same co. that put out UFO's Strangers in the night review on dvd
4,louie vega hits again,"this superb cd produced by louie vega is another gem in your elements of life/masters at work collection.luisito quintero plays great,great percussions and all the musicians which collaborate with him do a phenomenal job.the sound in the cd is sharp and clean.all the productions are catching and easy to get along with.you could dance and you could chill at the same time,that's what louie vega is all about.this cd deserves it all..."
4,Risk taking venture,"The story validated what I earlier believed; it took away just what Julia wanted -- assumptions of what people perceive as who we ""might"" really be or what we are really about.After reading, I felt as if I made a tree-sit visit with Julia. Thanks for the invite..."
4,How much do you expect one woman to accomplish?,"Robert Parker's review was only partly right - why expect Julia to be able to write ""on Walden Pond"" when she's under the daily pressures of the conflict between nature and politics? The book stands up (like Luna), and taken for itself is a testament to personal spiritual and ecological action. Personally, I think the fact that it's an easy read will make it more widely read - and that's not a bad thing. Butterfly is a great inspiration."
5,GREAT Reading!,"This is a ""must read"" for anyone that needs a boost of what it's like to be extremely passionate about saving & helping something you love. In this case, Julia is determined to save an ancient tree called Luna. How people treated her & what she goes through is beyond belief! If each one of us had even a small portion of that type of passion, just think what we could accomplish in our lives with our jobs, families & helping save this planet from it's current road to devastation."
1,A bad bad lesson,"All this book teaches is about how breaking the law is okay. She was a trespasser and this book creates an example of how our personal property is in danger. Beware of this garbage. Don't let it pollute your mind. I don't like the way she lives her life, should I refuse to leave her home?"
2,"A great story, not a great book","What Julia Butterfly did for the Redwoods is amazing, I willadmit, and I am thankful to her for that. BUT....the book wasdisapointing...I quickly grew bored with her metaphors and repetitiveness. It didn't make any sense, and the ending was anti-climatic. I could hardly stand to finish it. I would LOVE to watch a documentary of her plight and the results, but the book I can't bring myself to recommend to anyone. END"
2,This Book Does Not Compare With Julia's Great Feat - Sorry!,"Let me be perfectly clear: Julia Butterfly Hill has done a great thing for us all with her two-year stint in the tree called Luna. However, this book is a crashing disappointment. It was obviously written quickly, perhaps at the urging of the publisher's desire to cash-in on Julia's fifteen minutes of fame ( the book was in the stores only three months after Julia came down from the tree!). I guess I had hoped the book would tell me more about Julia's life prior to the tree-sit; after all, how many evangelist's daughters go off to save the earth? Julia's story is very compelling, but this book does nothing to flesh it out. And the cover photograph? Looks more like something for Vanity Fair, all touched-up like that. Yikes! They're making Julia into an Icon, a Rock-Star! I'm afraid her message about the forests will be lost in her celebrity! At least all the author's earnings for this book will go for the forest's cause."
1,How many?,"Julia Hill climbed up a redwood to stop the massacre of the trees. By doing so, she saved that tree, and a few acres around it. Now, think of how many trees died to publish her book and tell me if she was being altruistic. Bad girl!"
4,"The ""Silent Spring"" of our time","Julia Butterfly Hill is the Rachel Carson of our time. I loved this book ... There are very few people who ""walk the walk."" Julia truly shows us how to make a difference with this book."
5,Read This Book!,"For Julia Butterfly, Luna became the focus of vast and eternal truth. We, trees, and all living things are a part of Nature's life. We are all connected by the same life force which circulates through us all. We humans, being the most advanced of Earth's life forms, must take responsibility for protecting, preserving, and promoting life - all life.This Julia dared and suffered to do, and if we will pay attention, we can all benefit from her tree-sitting adventure."
2,Dirty Business,"This is a well-acted series with interesting storylines, but it's full of unlikeable, unprincipled characters, most of whom have the morals of alley cats (sorry alley cats). The only bright spot is Danny (Matt Smith) whose character shines like a beacon in this otherwise depressing expose of human nature."
1,does not fit Subaru despite compatibility claim,This sensor causes idle to be at 1600 RPM. I should have read Subaru forums before ordering this product - this is common case with Bosch sensors in Subaru.
1,What a disappointment!,"The authors write a very convincing introduction about how many books are written by people who don't really know how to write, blah, blah, blah. I just KNEW this would be the book that would be written to a true novice level.I was out of my league by page 43. In just that short amout of time, I progressed from kindergarten to high school senior. Or at least, the book did. I was still in kindergarten.I wasted a lot of money on this book. Just because a book is written by a designer and a programmer, it doesn't mean that they understand the first thing about explaining concepts.I want my money back. Save yours. Buy Franklin and Makar's Macromedia Flash MX Actionscipting (Advanced) if you want a truly basic book that takes its time introducing you to new concepts."
4,Great coffee grinder,"I received the shipment within 2 days of placing the order and everything is great . . . with one small exception. This coffee grinder is supposed to have 3 little round rubber ""feet"" to keep it from sliding around on a countertop. My coffee grinder was missing the 3 rubber feet. I searched the packaging but could not find them anywhere. I'm beginning to suspect that maybe this was part of a rejected bath of product from Mr. Coffee. I had a Mr. Coffee grinder before this one and it had the rubber feet. So did my Mom's Mr. Coffee grinder."
1,"Yes, it grinds..... once","Really, zero stars would be better. The first one actually worked a few times. Then it simply stopped working. Push the button, nothing. I bought another one. You might ask: why? Honestly, I don't know. It is good looking, there were not many choices at the store... I don't know. Big mistake. The second one only worked once. Push the button, nothing."
4,Classic,"I bought this same Mr. Coffee Grinder in 1998, and it still works--I just ground a pound of beans with it, in fact. Seriously, 14 years? Who makes devices that last that long anymore? I don't know how many coffee makers I've had since 1998, but I know how many grinders I've owned...1.14 years, and it still grinds beans like a champ. 'Nuff said."
4,Good purchase,It is very handy. Does it's job perfect. Me and my husband like it very much. The only problem is when grind the coffee into fine powder it sticks at the grinder. otherwise it is fine. Worth buying it.
5,Great Little Grinder Seven Years and Counting,"This amazing little blade grinder has been crushing up our beans now for seven years and counting! They should have called it the Energizer ... it just keeps grinding, and grinding, and grinding ....No bells and whistles, just plug it in, fill it with beans, put on the lid, push down on the button, count to ten, turn upside down filling lid with grounds, dump grounds from lid to coffee maker basket, replace lid, put back in cupboard 'til tomorrow morning.If you need more from your grinder, don't look here, because that's all there is to it. But if you just need to make great coffee every morning, and need a reliable grinder at a great price, this is the one you are looking for.Put me down as one fully satisfied customer."
3,Review of Mr. Coffee Grinder,"I purchased this as a replacement for a friend's (which I dropped and broke). It's an adequate grinder, but not top of the line. The ground coffee particles range in size from powder to fairly big chunks. It gets the job done, but I'd consider spending the money for a better one with plate grinders rather than the food-processor-type blades. It's also difficult to clean."
2,Not durable? These things are fragile!,"I went through my first one in four months. The second one burnt out a motor the very first time I used it. With much better models going for just a couple of dollars more, there's no reason to miss a single morning's cup of coffee because of this product. To it's credit, it worked well during its short life."
2,On-Off lid tab has broken on two that I've owned,"I have one of these that has been going for years, but I have gone through two (I use two simultaneously-one for coffee and one for flax seed)in which the lightweight lid tab that pushes the on off button on the base has broken off. One of them about the fifth time I used it. The first one the on off got stuck frequently in the on position so it would run with the lid off. Very dangerous! There has to be a better brand out there."
5,Love Returns For An Encore!,"The author has done an outstanding job of writing the continuation from Roses Are Red. I truly enjoyed how the author shows us how someone with unresolved love issues and misunderstandings can be a perfect mix for a perfect ending. The encore of these two old friends, Arlisa and Brad, is exciting, funny and has such an intense development of the love they share so deep in their hearts. Life situations, cause you to just step out there on faith and take that risk on someone you love, and this story illustrates just that by teaching Arlisa and Brad both to trust each other. This story had a surprising plot that will be interesting to all the readers."
5,hampson looks at the questions I avoid,"Daphne Hampson, in this follow-up to Theology and Feminism, has the guts to look at many questions that I avoid. Being both a feminist and a Christian, I often pick up the questions she raises, and I quickly set them down before they shake the foundations of my spiritual life too deeply.I am impressed at her ability to stare at the deep dark well of incompatability between self-love as a woman, and the love of a masculizined tradition. She lets down the bucket, and draws up some refreshing conclusions.It is certainly heartening to read her as a guide to thought *after* Chrisitianity. I so often come to that door and refuse to open it; hence, I had the opportunity to follow her over that difficult threshold, and found myself convinced of the rightness of the questions she asks---and that have lingered in my heart for years.Great, if not challenging, book!"
4,nice entry-level LCD projector,"I bought the unit for less than $700 after rebate from Best Buy on Thanksgiving 2004. I mounted it on the ceiling and project onto a 70"" x 70"" screen. This results in a picture with a diagonal of over 80"". Even with the blinds open or the light on, the picture is still visible fairly well. The picture looks amazing at night.However, due to the low contrast of 400:1, it is hard to follow the action in dark scenes. The lack of an optical zoom leaves you only one spot to position it.Overall I am pretty satisfied. I knew that for that price I would have to make some sacrifices. Currently I am looking for a DLP projector with a higher resolution (1024 x 768) and a better contrast (2000:1)."
2,These aren't the stars you're looking for,"If you're a Mark Knopfler fan, as I am, you've probably heard rumors of a collaberation with Dave Edmunds under the name ""Brewers Droop"". This apparently is that album, but the rumors have been a bit ravaged by time.Brewers Droop was a late-60's British pub band. According to the liner notes, the band decided to regroup in 1973 and hired a then-unknown youngster by the name of Knopfler. You could think of this as ""The Beatles, featuring Tony Sheridan"", only less. Dave Edmunds' only appearance is on pedal steel and backup vocals for one track. Mark Knopfler plays guitar on three tracks, but it's so early in his career that Edmunds' steel playing sounds more like Mark than Mark does. Edmunds is credited for producing three tracks on the disc.In short, if you're looking for the origin of the Dire Straits sound, you won't find it here. This is a creditable, but uninspiring effort by a largely unknown bar band who had a Lettermanesque Brush With Greatness."
4,"This is an excellent center channel speaker designed to match the e series spakers E10,E20,E30 thru the E100 tower system.","This is an excellent center channel speaker,that is designed to match the Northridge series speaker systems...The center channel speaker,helps with the dialog,and focus and image,presented in a home theater system...I highly recommend this center channel speaker. 4 star rated. thank you."
4,takes getting used to,"At first I was very disappointed with this lip balm. I bought it at a convenience store near our campsite because I forgot to bring any. I was expecting it to go on smoothly, like a chapstick. But after a couple days of using it, I realized my lips had gotten incredibly soft. The hard wax was actually gently exfoliating my lips, and they were getting so nourished. This was my first winter (I used to live in Hawaii), and my lips loved this lip balm. Because it's more waxy, it lasts so much longer. It may not feel the greatest at first, but it's so good for your lips."
1,Very disappointed,I had high expectations for this based off of my previous experiences with Burts Bees products. I found the fragrance of this extremely unpleasant. My mom gave it a try since she was looking for something and immediately gave it back to me. I purchased it at a gas station so I can't take it back.
2,Nasty Scent,I was really disappointed with the lip balm. The scent makes me gag and the lip balm doesn't work well either...Chapstick is MUCH better in keeping your lips moisturized. I can't stand the smell. I've only used it twice and I won't be using it again because of the nasty scent.
4,A exceptional sci-fi tale!,"Dark Star was one of the first sci-fi books that I read, almost twenty years ago and my recollections of this title are very positive. Indeed, Alan Dean Foster has created a inquisitive, strange, thoughtful tale of loneliness, friendship and hopelesness among the distant stars. In fact, ""Dark Star"" is a book about the loss of hope that assailed the mankind, mainly in the 70's years. But it's not a dated book. You can read it now and certainly you'll find some great images completely acuratte for the nowdays."
4,Koss=Quality,"I own this player, Koss Headphones, and a set of Koss loudspeakers and love them all. Top quality and sound. The only gripe I have is one I have with ALL boomboxes. Loading doors on top. When are the designers going to figure out that the top, where they almost always place the loading doors, is where all the dust and dirt gather. Flat smooth top for cleaning and front load for keeping the inside clean. Please!!"
3,Vibrating alarm clock,"If you sleep in a high noise environment, or have trouble hearing, then this alarm is a great solution. I would rate it a 5/5 stars for that purpose. I would, however, give it a 1/5 star rating for its form, function and quality. It does the bare minimum of its intent, but it is styled and built so cheaply that I am in near constant fear of knocking it over and breaking it, especially as the snooze button is at the unsteady top of the thing. It is too unstable for a half-asleep person to turn off. Additionally, it has no automatic reset function (that I have found at any rate). If you want to turn the alarm off, then you must turn the switch to off. If, as most people do, you want it to wake you up at the same time again the next morning, then you must turn it on again. To keep from knocking the blasted thing over while doing this requires both hands. Every other electronic alarm I have ever used has a reset button to perform this important task."
4,Amazing Clock,"I bought this clock because I was going to be working grave shifts and sleep during the day, and I needed something that would wake me up with earplugs in. The vibrating disk goes inside my bottom pillowcase (I use 2 pillows) and has never fallen out. This clock actually makes me get up the first time it goes off (much to the pleasure of my wife). I agree with the other reviews... The clock feels unstable because of its small base, but I quickly learned how to hold it to turn it off. As far as a reset, when I get up I turn the alarm to off and then right back on again, that way I won't forget. I highly recommend this clock!"
1,Lousy product reliability,We've had this alarm clock for 6 months and it suddenly stopped working. I took it back to Sharper Image and was told it was sub-standard and that's why they don't have it anymore. They offered me a $40 credit to buy thier new updated one for $99! Why would I throw good money after bad!! Not only do I not recomend this alarm clock I further warn against purchasing anything from Sharper Image. This isn't the first time they have burned us with lousy products.
3,Don't buy it you need something that won't wake your partner,"I bought this alarm because I wanted to be woken up in the middle of the night without disturbing my partner. In other words I was interested in the vibrating feature.The alarm is loud as said when you use the sound, but even if you only use the vibrating disk which is pretty ennoying (and even between pillows.) It doesn't only shakes me, it always wakes up my partner every single time I use it..."
1,good for small children,"i found this book pretty dull. i guess if i were 9 or 10, it would be more interesting. it is, however, easy to understand."
3,All or nothing,"Well, it's convenient, but the way this pot works is that once you bring the liquid to a boil, if you want it to simmer it alternates between no heat and full heat. So, every so often it will get to boiling wildly then shut off, and keep going this way. I'd rather have something (like a rice cooker?) that would actually keep a simmer going with constant low heat."
2,What Happened?,"I bought this cooker to replace my older Presto Options cooker that I absolutely loved. It was my favorite for stew, spaghetti sauce and any other dishes that need to simmer slowly. This piece of junk doesn't seem to have any temperature below boil! Trying to simmer something is a nightmare. If you want to simmer, you have to set the control to ""warm."" And for some reason they changed the cord to a two part magnet thing that keeps coming off. The picture showed the old control that I had on my older Presto cooker but when it came, it had this new control. What happened to this great product?"
1,Shoddy Product,Do not buy this shoddy product. I had the previous model made in the USA and it lasted 20 years. This new model has been redesigned for you to have to build it yourself. The plastic legs and handles have to be screwed on but do not stay in place. The handles wobble and the legs have to be tightened after each use. This new model was designed to be produced as cheaply as possible and for you to put it together. And it is made in China.
3,"Cooker, yes; Fryer, NO","I bought this because I wanted a good multi-tasker for outdoor cooking on our enclosed porch. It's perfect for cooking side dishes such as soups or cheese-grits and keeping them warm for cook-outs or fish fries, but it is just not reliable or suitable for deep frying. The temperature dial is marked to 400, but when heating oil and using a good thermometer I have never gotten it to heat oil beyond 360, but even then the thermostat cuts on and off so much it does not hold that high heat for quality deep frying.The break away cord is also annoyingly short."
3,Presto says not to fry in this unit,The enclosed manual states in bold type to NOT fry in the multi-cooker. Obviously you could fry in it (the regulated temp goes to 400 degrees) but I noticed that ALL Presto fryers no longer have baskets. I suspect that a lawsuit resulting from a full basket tipping over a fryer led to Presto adding the disclaimer and their removal of baskets from ALL fryer products. ...
2,disappointment,"The first word that comes to mind over this cooker/steamer is disappointment. The unit is smaller than the dimensions given and the wall thickness of the unit is substantially less than the older model (10 years older) that I still have. The result is a less satisfying cooking result. It probably will be okay for soups, but for frying and general heat retention for roasts & crockpot meats I'm not at all satisfied."
5,Great Buy!,I received a fryer like this one as a wedding gift 20 years ago. When it broke I insisted on getting one just like it. I love it and hope this one will last 20 years too.
1,NOT A DEEP FRYER,Not until you unpack the instructions does it say this cooker cannot be used as a deep fryer.
4,It really boiled,"I was amazed that it actually boiled water relatively quickly which is all I wanted it to do. The strainer basket is cheaply made, bu reasonable substitutes are available."
5,Best Design - Simple,I went to a couple of appliance stores to look at fryers. The Presto 06003 is the best unit by design. It's very easy to clean after use. The other fryers had the heating elements inside the frying container. They would have been very hard to keep clean. The Presto 06003 heating elements are embedded underneath the pot outside of the oil area. So you just have a simple pot to clean. Very impressive and it did a great job on my fish & chips. Heating controls from 0F to 400F... so you can use this cooker for many applications.
2,Presto Multi-Cooker,"This is the second Presto Multi-cooker I have had. The first one was wonderful, but after having it for about 7 years, I dropped it and broke a plastic foot off. Instead of trying to replace it, I bought a new cooker.The new one is very similar, the only difference being the temperature control. Whereas the control on the first one was fantastic, the new control is not nearly as good. For example, if I set the temp of the first control on 212 deg (boiling), water in the pot did just that, it boiled very slowly. Other temp setting were also good.The new control is very different. In order to adjust to just boiling, one has to set the control way down into ""Warm"" and the only way to get a temp you want is to just play with it. The numbers on the control mean nothing other than higher numbers give higher temps.Other than the problem with the new control, the new cooker is just as good at the old one. Identical, in fact."
5,love it,This is my second one only because my daughter didn't know what to get me for Xmas so I told her to get me another one. I only use it for frying and store the grease in the pot so some has dripped down the kettle and looks crummy otherwise I would keep this one. I have had it for about 7 years and it still works. Hope the new one lasts as long.
4,fry happy !!,"Had an older version from about 10 yrs ago finally kicked the bucket. Bought this model & I love it, I use it mainly for frying chicken wing dings & its great."
2,serious health concerns with this cooker,"I was given this cooker for a gift and it was wonderful for a while, but then the side of the pot, at the interface of the liquids and air, began to flake off. Now, if I try to cook, then everthing has small black flakes. I am proposing to contact the government to see if there are cancer or other toxic health problems from ingesting this material. Meanwhile, I can no longer use the pot. It's a shame becasue, apart from this problem, it was a very nice kitchen tool, and will be hard to replace, since this company seems to have the monopoly on multicookers"
2,rather cheap,"I like to use this unit to slowcook roasts as well as make things like sausage&peppers. The non-stick coating has flaked off pretty significantly! Perhaps they should find a way to make the non-stick coating stick to the pot. ;-) Unless you want flakes of coating in your food, avoid this product."
2,formulaic....,"This book was simply about a murder investigation. How it all tied together in the end was boring and you expected the twists. It left me with no emotions or gave me a connection to any of the characters or the storyline.When I read historical fiction, I like to actually learn somethings about the history they take place in. This story could be transplanted into any historical time period and work the same exact way.I gave it 2 stars because at least the pace moved fast and it wasn't boring."
3,Starting to get obsessed,"I am an admitted fan of all of Rowlands earlier works and she does a great job of translating Japan to a western mind. However in her most recent works she seems to be fixiated on the homosexual or bisexual aspects of the culture. Not so much in the way she writes about it or assigns it to her characters as much as the repetition with which she refers to it. I am a student of ancient Japanese culture and history and have no problem acknowledging this aspect of the sexuality of men and women in ancient Japan. That being said, I feel in her latest work exhibits some preoccupation with deviant sexuality that I did not either see the need for or I felt it as a distraction from the story. Again, the mention of it was not my issue. It is the constant referal to it which annoyed me. This was present in a few of her other recent works as well. I will continue to read her however, because she does the world of Japanese history justice and I loved the ending in perfumed sleeve."
2,Simply a repeat of her previous books,"I think I have read all of Rowland's Ichiro books. They are becoming tiresome. It is roughly the same story told a few different ways, and the outcome is obvious from the beginning. The usual villain appears in each book, and it is clear from the ending of this one that this individual will continue to cause much the same trouble as he has thus far. The character of the villain's wife is simply ridiculous. The main characters that Rowland has created are likeable and interesting, if not particularly representative of feudal Japan. But I'm disappointed in Rowland and likely will pass by her next book. I read this one to the end, but could have put it aside at any time and not cared. I'd read it before in her previous books."
3,Complex and baffling as usual,"Laura Joh Rowland series of mysteries, set in 17th Century Togugawa Japan, continue to improve. Her plot in ""The Perfumed Sleeve"" is just as complex and baffling as usual, but her characters have grown in maturity and wisdom--they are adding more to the plot and distracting less from it. This novel is tightly paced and as intriguing as any in the series, but the most enjoyable for me so far because the characters now flow as smoothly as the action. While all her Sano Ichiro mysteries are a pleasure to read, this and her first novel in the series (""Shinju"") are my favorites."
5,Your basic towing ball,"There's nothing wrong with it, and it's the right size. I figure that's good enough for a towing ball to get give stars."
5,Chrome plating is durable!,"A trailer ball is a trailer ball, but this one is chrome plated and other reviews have complained about how durable the plating actually is. Towed with a trailer I rented from U-haul this weekend, and realized that the monkeys there hadn't tightened the coupling down correctly when all i heard was banging and etc under braking and acceleration. After tightening it properly and towing over the weekend, I returned the trailer and saw the trailer ball. It still looks perfect and it will probably outlast my tow vehicle. Only thing I'm annoyed about? The current price is over 50% less than what I paid for it from Amazon a couple months ago."
2,Just a jumble of his letters,"I suppose when you are able to download a book for free it is unfair to expect too much but this collection of letters from Cicero is pretty poor - there is no explanation as to when the letters were written, or why, and it soon becomes clear that they are in no particular order. Also, spelling mistakes are common and the translation is only just about acceptable. It's a short volume and, I suppose, constitutes a useful introduction to Cicero's letters (although it might also succeed in putting others off). Not recommended, I'm afraid."
4,A Virtual Reality Experience of the Oregon Trail Migration.,"For the most part, I really enjoyed this book--once I got into it. Israel and Lucy Mitchell and children are headed from Iowa to Oregon. Lucy does not want to go, but she gives in to her husband, who is a descendent of Daniel Boone and has the spirit of adventure in his blood. Along the way they meet James McLaren, a man grieving the abandonment of his wife and the loss by death of his 3 children. He consents to drive one of the Mitchell's wagons. A predictable romance springs up between Lucy and James. The bulk of the story covers the daily grind of the trip in an extremely interesting way. The author's style of writing was a little hard to get used to, however. At times I found myself rereading several passages to try to get the meaning that was not readily evident. All is all, it was a great story."
5,The Great Journey,Karen Fisher writes about the Frontier West with such vividness and authenticity one might believe she actually lived back then and has been reincarnated. Another rare skill the author possesses is the ability to depict male and female characters with equal force and finesse. Lucy Mitchell and James MacLaren are unforgettable protagonists. The journey they embark on is spellbinding. It is fraught with a tension so intense and exquisite one can only marvel at the storytelling skills of this great new writer. If you enjoyed 'Cold Mountain' then you'll love 'A Sudden Country'.
2,"The writer tries too hard to create a ""literary masterpiece""","The author, in this case, takes an event rich with possibility (the Oregon trail migration) and creates a novel which was borderline unreadable as a result of her attempt to create a ""literary masterpiece"". Using vocabulary which I certainly recognize, she crafts it into a language with which I am not familiar. It should be pointed out that I am quite educated, a voracious reader and an accomplished writer.I compare and contrast this work unfavorably with the brilliantly written Cold Mountain. All of the misgivings which I felt in undertaking that novel (luckily not realized) were confirmed in A Sudden Country. I could not help but feel that Charles Frazier would have taken the same story line and characters and crafted a far superior product."
1,Reader gets lost way out West!,"This book is not easy to read because it is easy to get lost- just like the little girls! The two parallel story lines are most confusing, along with little conversation to carry them. We develop no character insights or sympathy for them. And as if after walking all day and caring for 4 children and cooking and packing she has the Energy to meet another man in the brush!! Some imagination!!"
3,"""Cold Mountain"" does The Oregon Trail","If you liked ""Cold Mountain"" you'll like ""A Sudden Country"". If you didn't, you won't. I didn't but can't say that either book was bad, just that I'd never read them again or recommend either one. So, this review will only help you if you've read ""Cold Mountain"""
3,Not my cup of tea,I was interested in the setting but the telling was a bit pedantic and did not fire my imagination.
2,wanted to like it,"I looked forward to reading this novel. Inherent appeal of the subject matter. My ancestors also went to Oregon, took the same route. Probably in the same year. A talented author, obviously. Chooses her words carefully, avoiding the word ""and"" whenever possible. The first few pages introduce potentially interesting characters, contain many lovely, arresting images. Poetical. Lots of talent here, and if you can tolerate the writing style, you'll be able to read more than a couple of pages. Unlike this reader."
2,More work than pleasure to read...,"My crucial test of a good author is how well I can get 'lost' in a story. When I read a book, I want to be drawn into the story so I can focus on the story entirely, without my train of thought being interrupted by jarring sentences.I read the first few chapters and found myself continually stopping to review the previous paragraph to retrace my steps and understand what I had just read. I've read plenty of other spellbinding books by talented authors, and I had high hopes for this book. However, I found this book to be more work than pleasure by chapter three."
2,hard to like the characters,Gave me a more realistic view of crossing the country in a wagon train but I did not develop an attachment to any of the characters and would have considered not finishing the book if it weren't one of our book club selections.
4,R's Goods,I liked it. It's a sweet read and easy to get through. The characters are sensitive and the plot is engaging. Would I recommend it? Sure. Sometimes you need a little sweet in your life and this book has it.
2,up your sleeves,"6/23/08 This album is the same material as on the King Biscuit release,with the songs rearranged (5/6/73 S.F., Winterland) with the Blackberries.My copy came with a song list but no other info.If I had seen the song list I probably would've figured it out (one of my friends gets a gift)The sound is fantastic (of course not better than ""Performance"")But if you've got the King Biscuit release, don't buy it again. Donna"
4,Great Sounding Live Album!!!!,"This live album has a great sound--better than Live at the Fillmore or the double album recorded at the same time--half studio/half live It sounds like it was recorded at the Fillmore around 1974 --Clem Clempson was the guitar player along with Steve Marriot, Jerry Shipley, Greg Ridley and the Rasperrys (Mary Clayton and company) The only problem with it is there are no linear notes--it doesn't tell you when it was recorded or who is in the band and no song listing. But if you are a Humble Pie freak like me you can tell from listening----- the musicians and time period. The sound is great--better than Live At Fillmore but anything with Peter Frampton in the band is equal to or better than this one--only the clarity and sound is better. From a collector's standpoint-- you have no info on the cd but you must get it anyway. It was recorded a little after Frampton left the band--A must have anyway!!!!!!!"
4,Storage,Very strong and seals well with my Black and Decker vacuum sealer. Also can be reused with vegs.
1,Not what i wanted,"This is not what i wanted. Not usually slim and stick food film, reminiscent of polyethylene. May be, i just don't understand how to use it right"
1,WARNING: THIS PROGRAM DIES AFTER ONE YEAR,"I enjoyed using Zagat to Go for a year. Then the program refused to run. When I contacted Zagat, I was told that the program was actually a subscription. The program will not run unless you renew the subscription every year. This policy is not mentioned anywhere in the online descriptions. I can understand not being able to upgrade without paying the subscription, but to cripple the program with a drop-dead date is unforgivable."
3,You don't buy it -- you RENT it,"The Zagat reviews are great, and the software gives you the power of a small, user-friendly database. My only complaint is that you can't see the restaurant location on a map. The reviews from Vindigo's software (check out Vindigo's web site for more information about this product) aren't nearly as good, but the mapping feature is outstanding. I couldn't live without Vindigo, but I think the quality of the reviews from Zagat still offer enough value to justify owning both.As the previous reviewer mentioned, what you're ""buying"" is a one year subscription to the Zagat To Go software. After one year, the software drops dead. It's still a great deal if you need more than one Zagat city guide. One irritating thing is that Zagat charges $25 to renew your subscription, so you're better off just ""buying"" another copy from Amazon after your old copy expires."
5,Highly recommend,The respect for diversity of approach to spirituality from differing religiouse starting points is refreshing and uplifting. Have given copies to many friends and clients.
5,College Student,"Great, this makes your dorm more like home. I am a sophomore now, and after a year of nasty cafeteria food I got one of these. It 's a life saver. No more running to the cafeteria at bad hours, and it also saves money. If you cook for yourself, you really save on the seven dollars a meal in the cafeteria. It's very safe, and only requires a sturdy surface. =) I dont know how I lived without it."
4,Useful Electric Skillet,"This Rival 12"" elecric skillet has some good features - its size makes it less awkward to clean and store than the larger skillets, and the dome-shaped metal cover with cool-touch handle is lightweight. Heat is somewhat uneven, but another frypan I considered has a heavy glass lid that could not be picked up without a pot holder and I would hesitate to place it on a countertop because of its weight ( also don't like heavy lids that might fall and damage the floor) This skillet works well enough for us.lotsalamps"
1,electric fry pan,"was not happy with this, i had to return, went to put it together and it was missing parts and it was purchased before or something because the packaging was not original"
2,Disappointed,I received the electric skillet and discovered that the lid was plastic because it came with a large crack in it. They sure don't make things the way they used to! I was very disappointed and returned it to the store. I am looking for another one that has a metal lid rather than a cheapy plastic lid.
4,A good kitchen tool,"I have used this skillet more than any other kitchen gadget I own - including the toaster! It's perfect for all kinds of stir frys, pork chops, chicken, burgers - pancakes too! The only thing I would change about it would be to make the outside cool to the touch - I've burned myself twice so far by accidentally bumping into it."
4,ELECTRIC COOKWARE,"This is an excellent product for the price. Finding a place to store it might be a minor problem due to its ""footprint"" and height. All things considered and the way it cooks says ""buy it""."
2,Disappointed,"Totally disappointed. Ran large in size, super thin, incredibly SMELLY plastic rain slicker. Next time I'll spend more money and get a quality item. You do get what you pay for."
1,no response from seller about wrong size and overcharged for shipping!!!,"i was very disappointed with the seller's service. there has been no response from the seller about me receiving the wrong size for my son (3)--i ordered an XS and got a M and was overcharged for shipping!!! we are now attempting to resell the raincoat on craigslist and sure won't buy another from this seller, even thought we would have just exchanged it if they ever responded.-sw"
5,Nicely Done!!!,This is a nicely done film about an adopted daughter with a severe medical condition forcing to search for her biological mother!!It's well worth watching!!
1,Marred by incredibly sloppy research,"I was shocked to find that this book, bearing the imprimatur of the BFI, was so poorly researched and so sloppily assembled. One example -- a film that merits an entire chapter is not even mentioned in the index! Winston has done some good work in the past, and has some interesting ideas, but should be ashamed of having this mess released with his name on it."
5,I really give this book 10 stars**********!,"I cannot believe I haven't written a review on Tully until now. For about 7 years this has been my favorite book. It was the inspiration for me to write my own novel as a matter of fact! This is one of those books that you buy and get a second copy so that if something happens to the first you won't go into withdrawal!I have read it about 10 times and each time I find myself forgetting what happens at the end. Maybe that just means I am forgetful, but I like it! The plot to this story can be at times upsetting and frustrating, but it is a story you won't want to weave the fabric of your life without! If you haven't already bought Tully, run, don't walk, to this checkout section and do it already! You won't regret it one single ioata!"
1,Wasted Shelf Space,"I bought this book when it first came out in 1994. For 10 years it sat on my bookshelf. Just a week ago I took it down and decided to read it.... the only thing I can say is ""did I really dust this damn thing for 10 years?""I can't wait for some poor sucker to buy it at my yard sale this spring.... yuck!"
3,Engaging soap opera,"I found Tully a very engaging and at times powerful read. But Ultimately I felt it became too much of a soap opera. Entertaining, but not life changing."
2,God What A Depressing Book,"There was one reviewer who said if you want to feel utterly frustrated with a character...read this book. I couldn't agree more. The book, while it did keep my attention, was EXTREMEMLY depressing. The story of an unbelievably selfish woman who just destroys people's lives. The people she destroys are utterly co-dependent on her. Just as you think finally something positive would happen...bam...there she goes again. An drawn out, very disappointing ending. I don't even want to resell this book...I just want to throw it out. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one was because I DID finish it."
1,poor me,Terrible book. Cannot believe that people didnt grow tired of such a weak main character. Poor Tully boo hoo. The writing must have been good though to evoke such a strong response but I was barely able to finish - I hung on to see if she grew a backbone but alas!!
5,Tully moved me to tears and laughs it is the best book!,"Tully, what can you not say about this book? My mom gave me this book and at first I was intimadated, it looked so long. The truth is I read it in two weeks. I would come home and all day I would be thinking about Tully. Now, after all of my friends have read it, we are always comparing our lives to Tully. Usually I start to read books then halway through I lose interest, bu Pauloina Simmons kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.(Now I can no longer say that a book I read is the best because I will always compare it to ""Tully"") I never knew what was going to happen. Paulina I applaud you for writing one of the best books that I have, and will ever, read! Tully is no longer a character, she is my friend."
5,This book's characters and themes may stay with you forever!,"I read this book over two years ago and will NOT lend it to anyone! I am so afraid it will disappear. I even read it on the bleachers at my son's Little League games because I just couldn't put it down and the coach commented, ""That must be one great book!"" because he knew how much I love baseball with the kids! READ THIS BOOK and own a copy. I have just this week recommended it to my almost 16-year-old. I KNOW she will love it, too."
2,Frustrating and Depressing,"I read so many great reviews about Tully that I thought that I would love it. And while it is well written, I felt more depressed with every page. The title character has such a terrible life and is so bottled up emotionally and unable to express herself that I just wanted to scream. She has a a deep need to leave her life in Kansas and escape to California. I kept thinking of It's a Wonderful Life and how George Bailey wants to leave Bedford Falls and travel the world and while I found that movie to be charming, Tully is just sad. The plot was like a soap opera with incest, child abuse, suicide and misery. What is interesting to me is that my mother was also driven to escape Kansas. She went to college and lived the majority of her adult life in California. I thought that I would really relate to this book but it was just depressing and miserable to read."
4,Don't read this if you want a likeable heroine,"I've read this book several times, and I still don't know if I like the main character. She's profoundly emotionally stunted and selfish, but it's the result of horrific abuse she suffered as a child.Some reviewers seem disappointed that Tully never grows up or turns altruistic, or whatever, but I think it's pretty realistic. Many abuse survivors learn to rise above their pasts, and become amazing people, but some don't. Tully is one of the ones who don't. Inside, she's a needy little girl forever. However, I feel that this is a theme that's worthy of being explored."
3,Little depressing,"Usually this is not the type of story that keeps my attention, however I bought the book just because Paullina Simon is the author. She did it again; she captivated me from the beginning to the end and even if Tully is definitely not one my favorite personage, I was eager to learn more about her and her life. Regretfully this is not a funny read, Tully is not an easy and lovable character and nor is her life and surrounding. I have to admit that at the end of the book I was kind of depressed, but I guess this is also an emotion that just a talented writer such as Mrs. Simons are able to inspire."
4,Tully,"I love Tully. It's one of the best books I read. It got me addicted to Paullina Simons and I love everything she has written,"
5,rave review,"I just can't stop raving about this book. It was fantastic, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Alhough, I was quite upset when I finished reading it. I wanted it to go on forever. I have recommended this book to everyone I know, and they have loved it as much as me. Tully is a must read for everyone!!"
5,I loved this book!,"It is always a good sign when you hate to see a book end, I loved every minute of this book."
3,Very frustrating book!!,"If you feel like reading a book, that leaves you completeley frustrated with the character, than this is it. Tully, is an utter mess. She doesn't know what she wants or who she wants. I enjoyed this book, but at times, I did not like Tully. She was sometimes very unlikable. Over and over, I thought to myself. Tully, make up your mind!"
4,Great book!,"I already read few books about C# and dotNET, and mostof them were usually too big with too many details.This book was with short and clear explanations thatwere easy to memorize and the examples were excellent!I don't recommend it as the first book for beginners, asit does not elaborate, but it is great as a referenceand as tutorial for people who already know about C#"
5,Better than just a 2.0 upgrade book,"I expected this book to just cover the enhanced 2.0 features. That's not the point at all. This is an all you can eat C# introduction book that goes really, really fast. Read in the title that this is for 'programmers'. That means that the author expects you to understand how to program an object oriented language. If you know that already then this book will get you into C# 2.0 quickly and easily. If you don't know how to program, then this book is not for you."
2,Not an introductory book,"A print copy of this book is probably a bad idea, since its main value is its capability of describing differences between C# 1.x and 2.0. Not written to groove anyone into using C#; targeted more at people who know 1.x intimately or those coming from a java or c++ background, wanting to know about generics and other ""new"" features. It would sure be nice to have the pdf freebie that comes with a lot of apress books, but no -- it costs another $30. If you really want to know about C# from the ground up, this book can only be ancillary to something like Liberty's book or Troelsen's Professional C# and the .Net Platform. Hence the fact that you can buy it used for $10 or less."
5,A Return to Florida's Dangerous Waterways,"Scuba diver Luanne Fogarty is trying to locate the owner of a remote piece of land when she stumbles on a pregnant mother giving birth. When the two midwives leave with the baby, she gets involved trying to track down the trio. Where did they go? And is the baby still alive? When a realtor dies in a mysterious accident, Luanne realizes there is much more at stake. Can she stay alive long enough to find the answers?This follow up to last year's Dive Deep and Deadly is just as much fun as it's predecessor. The plot and characters are well developed, and the author's sense of place is very well defined. Using all five senses effectively, Ms. Alam manages to place the reader in Florida and Georgia right along with the characters.I highly recommend both books in this series. They are a real treat for the mystery lover."
5,Innocent Death,"Glynn M. Alam takes us deep into the swamps of Northern Florida as she searches for unexplored caves and space to set up equipment. An old house falling to ruin would give shelter from the frequent storms that sweep across the area. She encounters two women assisting a live birth in the mouldering dwelling. The women flee taking the baby with them to the river leaving Luanne Fogarty with the hemorrhaging mother.DEEP WATER DEATH has more twists that the trails of water through invading foreign plant growth that destroys the natural supply of oxygen for native animal and plant life.The search for the illegal mid-wives leads Luanne and the Sheriff's department to Georgia and the manipulations of a local owner seeking to establish a resort or commercial development within protected wetlands.The second addition to the unique series is tightly plotted with just the right amount of romance for the sleuth.Nash Black, HAINTS and WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS."
4,Awesome music - fidelity a bit lacking,"The opening song ""The Beatitudes"" by Albinoni is incredibly moving, so much so that the other songs have a hard time comparing. Overall, excellent, although the fidelity could be greatly improved. I had to crank up my volume 30-40% higher to achieve a comparable volume and noticed some distortion (in the recording, not my system) that was a bit distracting. Still, an outstanding CD."
2,Could be better,"After owning Agnus Dei I for years, and somehow misplacing the CD, I decided to buy both I and II from Amazon. Of the CD's, I is still my favorite. Agnus Dei II is a decent CD, but it doesn't have the fluidity or the dynamics that the first disk has. I guess I got spoiled with the first disk."
3,Albonini's Adagio (Beatitudes) is an Italianate emotion feas,"I happened upon this album while looking for some choral works for a church choir. Not schooled in the literature, I had never heard of Tomaso Albinoni. His Adagio (""Beatitudes"") is a choral emotion feast in Italian style, the likes of which I have never heard before. Unless...did the Coppollas (pere et fils) use it in the soundtrack to Godfather 3? I'm not sure. Great piece. The rest of the album is okay. Standard fare."
3,Probably not of interest to most,"Compiled from the satirical Soviet magazine ""Krokodil"", Soviet Humor showcases cartoons that lampoon daily life in the Soviet Union. Captions, when written, are translated into English. The book is divided into five parts: Relationships, Lifestyles, Social Vices, Politics and Environment each with drawings that poke fun at Soviet life. What is perhaps most surprising is the universality of the experiences contained within - everyone will be able to relate in some way with most of the humor.As a Russian specialist, this book was of particular interest to me. For others, I suspect they may not find it that intriguing. As far as the artwork and type of cartoons: think of a Russian version of the New Yorker and you're pretty close to the mark."
1,"Even Worse Than ""Arliss""","This badly reviewed, low rated stinkbomb is the worst series in HBO's whole history. Mike Binder incredibly got to star in it because he's a best friend of Chris Albrecht, the head of HBO, whose other buddy, Robert Wuhl, also stunk up the joint with the horrific ""Arliss."" If it were possible to erase DVD discs, then these all would be blank. Call this show, ""The Downside of Binder."""
1,Claim: poor quality,"I bought this product and after less then 40 days, and with very few operations, it broke.I think that Amazon should have informed that this was for hobby application only."
3,Great cultural history lesson,"The book was published in 1901 and the author is an admitted admirer of Abe Lincoln. The detailed descriptions of 19th century living conditions, the contemporary culture, and politics of the time is instructive and very interesting."
4,Completely Satisfied,The author provides great insight into the Life of Lincoln including little known facts and spends time on the relationships between Lincoln and his peers.
4,Good Read,It is a good read. It gives a lot of history that is very interesting. It is enlightening to find out more from that time.
5,Timely,This was a great purchase and so timely with the new Lincoln movie just out. I really enjoyed it all and have recommended it to my friends.
4,Great read,"This was a very informative view into the life of one of our prominent presidents. The book chronicles his road to the presidency, his decisions, and his reasons for those decisions. If you want to read about a great president then this one I would surely recommend."
4,Tom's Take,"This 1901 biography is charming in its antiquated prose and style. I'm sure the occassional misuse of words and punctuation are from the transcription to digital format and careless use of spell-checking substitution. One wonders who edited this ""printing.""The content is formidable in detail and comprehension, drawing on a plethora of quotations and anecdotes. The author thoroughly held my attention and enjoyment."
5,The Real Lincoln,"Although I am not American, I was mighty impressed with the way this book described the ""real"" Honest Abe. A role model for all mankind. The book reveals a kind, sincere and sensitive man , who willingly drank the cup of woe that was the state of affairs back then. He was more of a prophet , than a statesman.Favourite parts are the emotions he felt when he saw the wounded Confederate soldiers and the boy soldier who was sentenced to death for sleeping at his post , whom Abe pardoned."
4,Lincoln,"I've loved Abraham Lincoln since I read a biography of him in the third grade for a book report. There are no shortages of biographies of the great men in American History and they are all generally variations on the same stories that I learned in the third grade.This book is unique in that it is written by a general in the Union Army..though he never mentions that in the book. The author actually knew Lincoln, fought for the Union and can knowledgably speak of the other generals and the civil war as he was involved.But this is not a book about Henry Ketcham, much to his credit. It's a loving book of Lincoln. It is not a book to learn the history of the time, though you do. It's a book to make you feel as if you actually knew Lincoln. Reading the Eulogies at the end of the book brings tears to your eyes and makes you realize what a truly great man he was. Not just a great President, that's obvious, but a great man."
5,Good story,Lincoln would have been an interesting man to meet. What oratory skills and what a sense of humor. Mary Todd was not really a good mate for him.
5,The Life of Abraham Lincoln,I really enjoyed this book. It was easy to read and gave interesting insights into Lincoln's life. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes biographies or civil war era reading.
5,good book,an older biography but adaquate. we now have many more original sources than mr. ketcham had. given that fact this is a classic.
5,A leader who recognized from whom to get his strength,"Mr. Ketcham was obviously a great admirer of the President. He presented many aspects of Mr. Lincoln's personality. More importantly though I came away with the impression that the President who had no formal church training, felt that there was a God, and that He was the foremost authority to whom he could rely upon for his guidance and strength. Would that all presidents have such insight."
5,An amazing history of Lincoln,I chose this book because I have always admired this great man and although I have read many other books about him and his life I learned a great many things I did not know. I came to feel that I now know him as if he had been a close personal friend.
5,The Life of Abraham Lincoln,The book is well researched and wonderully written. Even if you are not a history buff this is a great read.
5,Abraham Lincoln,"This book is very informative about the years leading up to his years as President, but also gives a good look into his life and relationships behind the eye of well known history."
4,I'm really glad I read it.,"This was a easy read, with a lot of history, of course. There was also a great amount of detail about his character and life."
5,An extraordinary biography for an extraordinary man,"Originally published in 1901, this is an extraordinary, loving tribute to one of the greatest of all American presidents, told by a general who served under him in the Union Army (although the author never alludes to this in his narrative. The insights regarding this exceptional individual, from his early childhood through his tumultous political career through the pain of a divided nation and his sad death are shared with humanity and honesty. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to have a greater understanding of what shaped ""Honest Abe."" The tributes shared by his peers in the last chapter show just how much this extraordinary individual impacted the nation he served so well."
3,Life of Abe lincoln,Very informative.The vocab and language seem off even for a book of this period. The author speculated too much but the bad part about that is that he continually stated that he would not.
3,Interesting,"This book is a little old fashioned - but it was written by someone who actually knew Lincoln. However, it is very readable and interesting. I wanted more information about the life and times of Lincoln and this fit the bill."
3,this was a cool track,i always dug this cut Bobby was bringing the urgency on this cut and Whitney Houston nailed it. dug her background harmony and Teddy Riley was steady in the background. i always dug this track and it is a cool track. the mixes are cool as well.
3,UK Maxi Single Track Listing,'SOMETHING IN COMMON' - BOBBY BROWN & WHITNEY HOUSTON1) Radio Edit - 3:432) Extended Vocal Version - 6:553) Quiet Storm Version - 4:384) Dub Version - 6:281993
4,"""Heathers"" for the new generation","This was an enjoyable read. It tells the story of Rio, who's named after a Duran Duran song. She lives with her former model mother and lawyer father in Laguna Beach, but misses New York and her friends there (they recently moved).Rio makes a couple of friends from her art class in Laguna Beach, but then Kristi, cheerleader and queen bee, takes her under her wing. Suddenly, Rio has to follow rules...who to associate with, which boys to like, how to dress...or otherwise make Kristi mad. Everyone tiptoes around Kristi. But then, a fateful game of spin-the-bottle seals Rio's destiny. Kristi's not talking to her anymore, and she's turned the whole school against her.This was an insightful look at high school cliques, the fear of those in power, and also just a fun bubbly read that made me remember being a teenager. The writing was pitch-perfect and really sounded like a young adult."
1,I was looking for furniture real people would use,I just don't get anyone actually liking this book. I paid $12 and it is not even worth the shelf space. I love the author's other book. The stuff doesn't even look usable to me. Dlifferent strokes for different folks....
3,Does the job,The memory is not really a problem if you slightly decrease themusic quality of the MP3. You'd be surprised on how much more you canfit on this sucker. I think it is an excellent buy due to the FM Radio which Rio seems to lack in all their models...
4,i dont know,Hey guys does the i-jam mp3 player let you delete songs from the flash card? please write.
3,Good product but could be better,"The product looks nice, its small and compact and the sound is pretty good. The biggest problem with the mp3 player is that even though it comes with 32mb, it is 2 seperate 16mb chips. Each chip only holds about 4 songs so you either have to keep on changing the disk or listen to the four songs. It doesn't come with anything to hold an extra disk either. Other than that its a nice product, the radio works well, and since its so small, its easy to carry."
2,"Just Good,,,","I Buy one of these last year for my 12 years old daughter and looks and listen good, last christmas we try to intall it to a new computer with Window XP and we could't install, then we try to find the drivers for these Opeating System on their Web Site, and they don't have yet, but they will never have, so these device will be unusefull in any Computer with these Operating System Windows XP."
4,Great for the price,"It's a great deal for [the price]...no one can deny that. But, the 32MB is actually two 16MB cards which is a pain. I already lost one of them! People on the busy city street I was on couldn't understand why I was staring at the ground. I was looking for the memory card which is about as easy to find as a contact lense. Still, I've got my ""hefty"" 16MB left which can hold maybe 3 songs, but I can always fall back on the radio tuner..."
3,"Quality of the Synergy issue of ""Catholics""","I found the quality of this DVD to be very poor indeed. It's apparent that it was digitized from a poor copy of the film and never cleaned up. It's grainy; and there was a thin vertical scratch line running the entire length of the screen, about 1/4 in from the right edge. It was present throughout most of the movie, occasionally being joined by additional scratch lines & ""light spots"" (the kind of little blobs that appeared on old 35mm film when it was overheating and about to burn) It's only the excellence of Brian Moore's original play & the very, very strong performances delivered by the actors involved that made the DVD palatable and gave it the ""it's okay"" rating."
3,"Also released as ""Conflict""","Just a note to point out this film is also marketed on DVD under the title ""Conflict"", with Martin Sheen's name prominent despite his modest role. Amazon reviews for Conflict are more extensive than for this Classic edition so take a look. SeeConflict ~ Martin Sheenand alsoConflict ~ Trevor Howard.Update: Hey! Somebody touched the little button that said my review wasn't helpful! OK, try this transcendent DVD:Diary of a Country Priest."
1,"Great Picture, Terrible Film Quality","I love this movie. It's not just about the Latin Mass. It's about a totalitarian organization that can change its citizens' beliefs by simply contradicting what has been sold to them as truth. Martin Sheen and Travor Howard are outstanding, as is the supporting cast of monks.The technical quality was awful. I remember seeing the movie on PBS. The island and the monastery were beautiful and nothing had been cut. The first part of the movie with the Father General was cut in this version. The picture is grainy, the sound is filled with static. I keep looking for a clean copy of this film and I can't find it."
4,An unexpected pleasure!,"Having noticed the cover while in a small bookstore in Plymouth Michigan, I picked it up and began to read. I quickly became caught up in the tale of Terror lurking in the woods of Northern Michigan. Mr. Chaney maneges to render to the page the beauty of small town USA, while contrasting it with the horror that is woven into the history of the region. He has obviously done his homework on the Indian lore and legend that is so much a part of Michigans fabric.I finished this one the same evening that I purchased it. I recomend it highly!"
5,...like a freight train.....,"Although the ""freight train"" line gets old after the first several times it is written, the rest of the book is outstanding. This was probably the fastest read I've ever had-if it weren't for work I'd have finished it in a day. It'll make me think twice about just where I stop to camp this summer when I'm crossing through the Upper Penninsula of MI. The characters in the book spend more time in various stages of naked than in most horror books, but that's alright. A highly recomended book."
5,Party Time,"I highly recommend this non-stick fondue pot. It is very easy to clean and care for. The pot heats up quickly for cheese and chocolate fondues. It is a great entertainment appliance. My family and friends love it. The down side is you need to keep an eye on the plug. If over extended, the plug will break away from the pot."
3,3 quarts is a lot...,"If you are concerned that a three quart fondue pot sounds too big...well, it probably is. I made cheese fondue as an appetizer for a big dinner (for a party of 12) and this pot was still a bit bigger than I needed. Might be a great option if you're hosting fondue-specific parties for a group, but I'd say if you only expect to use this for smaller parties or infrequently, go with something about half the size. I would also echo what other people are saying about the very short cord - seems essentially designed to cook cheese or chocolate fondue in the kitchen and then bring out to a serving table afterwards, I can't really imagine having this in the center table with oil for cooking meat. Very good in terms of presentation, craftsmanship, etc."
5,Awesome Christmas Gift,"I purchased this for my mother who is in love with the Melting Pot Restaurant but who doesn't live very close to one. We also purchased the Melting Pot cookbook and had a fondue night all in this pot. First the cheese, then oil, and then chocolate. All we did was wash out in between the courses and it was really easy. The taste of the previous meal didn't manage to make it o the next and the oil barriar did a nice job of catching and splatter. We had a great time and I would 100% recommend this product."
5,Must have for vacationing!,"I purchased this bag to take on a cruise to the Caribbean. I knew that we would be purchasing gifts, so I wanted a bag that I could pack in my luggage for later use. I love that it folds into it's own case and takes up zero room in my suitcase. My Boyfriend thought I was silly for purchasing this bag, as he thought we would have plenty of room in our luggage for gifts. I purchased it anyway due to the positive reviews and the great price. I'm so glad I did! We purchased lots of rum in Jamaica, and used the Rick Steves bag to pack it all (we wrapped each bottle in bubble wrap). While preparing for departure from the boat, we accidentally put the bag containing the rum with our other luggage. Naturally we were terrified that it would get thrown around with thousands of other suitcases. When we reached customs, I was amazed to find that the hide-away bag was completely dry and the bottles of rum were intact! Now my Boyfriend insists on taking this bag when we travel."
4,Southern Fried Fun,"Imagine the hoot you get from an unexpected gift and that's what the Q's give you. From the rodent's rocking raucous Rat Bait to the farmer's female fixation Big Fat Tractor, these guys and gal belt out wretched tales of lust, fear, perversity and pure redneck ignorance over a pulverizing off-road beat. The party-picker-upper Stock Car Sin: ""monkey number one took the senator's niece, caked her thighs with axel grease, laid her on a prestressed bench and tightened his lugs with a socket wrench"" and ""the preacher's wife was in stock car sin, they know it's evil, can't help but like it"". The peon pounding pulsar Working in the Nut Plant: ""and on my skull from the front to the back, they say I'm living with a six inch crack-OUUUUUUUUUWH"". Now my head is cracked."
4,worth the $$$,It's great for younger kids and old alike. Our 2 year old loves trying to stack them! A nice educational game...makes you think.
2,Disappointing,"I grabbed this book with joy-at long last,a book on the Troggs!I struggled mightily to get through it,but it is written so strangely,it's really hard to get through.And I don't believe it's just because the authors are English.They've chosen to write in a very off-putting style.I have to rate this a major disappointment.The ultimate Troggs book is yet to be written."
5,Excellent addition to an eclectic music collection.,Wonderful CD-VERY highly recommended. I especially liked Misia's interpretation of Pessoa's work.
2,Harry James Singer,"This is a must have for Big Band fans. Marion Morgan was a little known singer with Harry James and it's a delight to hear. However, the CD is flawed, probably in the manufacturing process. Some tracks beyond 12 or 13 cannot be played unless you let the entire CD track from start to finish. Certain tracks toward the end of the CD just won't play individually. Be advised"
4,"Great Recordings, BUT OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOO !","Harry has always been great. Some really wonderful songs on here. Marion Morgan was one of the best band singers ever. Sounds great ? Yeah, but this is one of the worst CD`s ever. I keep hoping that Collector`s Choice will re-burn (or whatever they do), so we can have something that won`t be rejected by our CD players. If not, maybe Sony will get it together and release these Columbia 78 singles. Come on. If you re-do, I will re-buy."
4,Marion Morgan - What a Beautiful Voice,"Being a Harry James fan I had heard of her on the ""Harry James and His Great Vocalist"" CD. She has such a beautiful voice and Harry's playing is as always great."
2,inane,"My 3 year old got this for Christmas. The gifter should have saved their money and bought him socks, he would have enjoyed them more.This game takes up alot of space and seems to have you endlessly spinning the two dials to see what color you get. The colors aren't primary colors either, so you then begin a discussion with your child that ""yes, that really is green honey, it's called teal"". Frankly, I don't think 3 year olds need to be able to distinguish between green and teal. The first game is short and boring. The second game has all players using the same Pooh Bear icon along a Candyland like path, so it goes very quickly and didn't give my son very much pleasure.Overall, I would highly recommend skipping this one. Try Cootie,or Pooh's version of Candyland. Both teach colors and both are much more fun and rewarding (at least for my kid they were)."
3,"My son enjoys it, but. . .","My 5 and 2 year old boys really have enjoyed this game, probably mostly because they enjoy Pooh. There really isn't a whole lot of educational value, except the color matching is good for developing visual acuity. Also the second part of the game does offer a chance for younger children to complete a simple puzzle.The cardboard spinner and pieces don't hold up well, especially when little ones chew on them! All that being said, my kids really have played with it alot, so I guess it was worth the money. At the current Amazon price, you really can't go wrong."
4,"""Common Schools"" Designed to Create American Identity","Kaestle's book is an excellent review of the first hundred years of public education in America. After an introduction that covers Colonial America's mostly private or charity school systems, he outlines the forces that created the move toward public education paid for with tax money. It was a long, slow process, that in some ways was still not complete well into the 20th century, and has not been endorsed universally even now.I would classify Kaestle's writing style as ""easily readable academic"" - meaning that you would have to have a more than ""magazine article"" amount of interest in the subject, but wouldn't be buried in mounds of jargon or statistics. I found it very interesting for someone who wants to know why American public schools are so different from the public schools of England or other developed nations."
3,the specifics,"I ordered these CDs without really reading the very fine prints about how to write a memoir. This serie comes with 3 CDs. CD 1 is very helpful with great tips about writing well. CDs 2 and 3 are about writing a memoir. So for those looking on tips about memoir or autobiography writing, this would be helpful."
5,Like a Salsa Encyclopedia for a low price,"Not only did the DJs picked great songs, but there are just so many of them. Tracks from different record labels, eras, and locations.Top Colombians groups Fruko y Sus Tesos and Joe Arroyo, NYC greats like Tito Puente and Eddie Palmieri, Cuban legends like Celia Cruz and Benny More, and Puerto Rican island favorites like Cortijo y Su Combo and Tito Gomez.Not only is it a multilocation compilation, but it also showcases different eras. Where else will you find Perez Prado and Mayito Rivera.While obviously not all songs here are hits, there is no filler material here. Perfect gift for someone who is starting to get into salsa, but even veterans will find many tracks they probably have not heard before."
4,as i remeber it but out of order,rockos modern life season 1 just as i remember itsick funny and full of adult jokes that i didn't get until i bought the dvd loved itthe only issue was that the episodes were on the dvd out of orderwould highly recommend
5,Loved this show,"I'm so glad shout it officially releasing the first season, IMO they don't make cartoons like this anymore and thats sad. I hope to see the other three seasons released in the near future."
2,Sadly Censored,"After watching the first few episodes, I thought nostalgia wouldn't be enough to make me finish washing the set. However, it got better and I found myself really enjoying it. The most disappointing thing is that the the funniest scene I remember from when I saw it as a kid was removed. In ""The Good, the Bad and the Wallaby,"" there was a scene in which Heffer is erroneously attached to a milking machine and subsequently develops a romantic interest in it. Had I read the other reviews, I would have known it was censored, and probably wouldn't have bought it. I suppose if you're buying it for young kids the censorship is good, but I would guess the majority of people interested in the show are adults who want to see it as they saw it as kids. I will have to make certain season two has no cuts before I buy it.The cuts are very disappointing."
2,A bit of a disappointment,"I must admit, there are a bunch of much cheaper ""knock offs"" of the Verilux, but, I decided to spring for the extra money in order to get a quality lamp. Well, I was surprised and disappointed in the cheap build quality of this lamp. The pieces don't fit together quite right, and, it will not set firmly (is wobbly) on a flat hard floor (although it is fine on carpeted flooring). The lamps does a good job at providing light for reading, it is nice that it has a low and high lighting setting. But, in general, due to the low build quality, I'd not spend the extra money to get the original Verilux. My mother's $19 knock off is really pretty good by comparison."
4,Verilux,"The Verilux lamp provides even, easy on the eyes lighting. I do wish it were a bit brighter though."
5,Got what I wanted,Good lamp - easy to read by. With a slight turn away - I work on my laptop as I watch football. Pleased with it.
2,POOR CONSTRUCTION,The lamp directions show a screw to hold the lamp together but none was included so it falls apart.
3,"Nice light, some minor build issues","Bought this for my Mom. Her previous one mysteriously stopped working. This one arrived as expected, but when it was time to assemble it one of the screws needed to put it together was missing. I made do, but it was more frustrating than needed."
2,Falls apart and no support from manufacturer,Good lamp for brightness. Bought two. One lamp broke at end of goose neck as it enters the top of the long stand. The threads on the metal shaft holding the lamp together are super small and the shaft did not have enough length to give full support to the large head. Called maufacturer and was told curtly there was nothing they could do once the lamp was out of warranty. This is not a cheap lamp and if they had put some serious hardware into the overall construction it would be a GREAT lamp. To bad.
1,not what i expected,"it does NOT light a room, even a small one. it was much darker than i expected. i was looking for bright white light. enough to light a tiny office... very disappointing."
2,BREAKS IN 2,"IF YOU LIFT THE THING UP BY THE NECK- IT SPLITS, AND OPENS UNLESS THE SCREW THING IS TIGHT.ITS POORLY DESIGNED BUT PERHAPS A NICE LAMPYEAH TOO BAD NO DIMMER BUT WHAT DO U EXPECT FOR 100 BUCK?HOW ABOUT 150?its a Lamp"
2,lamp,Very disappointing lamp. Barely shines any light. Aesthetically pleasing but not very functional. Doesn't exactly light up the room.
1,Defective; Returned,"Ordered this using Super Saver shipping on a Friday night, received it that Monday. Great delivery time. However, when putting it together, the holes in the base unit and the stem unit did not match up no matter what I did, so it was impossible to insert the screw to connect them. (I did not have this problem connecting the light to the stem, so it wasn't me.) I returned it for a refund.Also: the diffuser does not look at all like it does in the picture. It is a cheap piece of silver-gridded plastic. The photo makes it look like a solid, opaque diffuser. I can't comment on whether the diffuser works, though, because I could never use the unit."
5,Verilux free standing reading lamp,"This unit is really nice. Easy to assemble, looks great, works great, and the light it produces is so soft and easy on the eyes!Jim Wesson"
1,Buyer Beware!,"I bought the expensive (for me) Original Natural Spectrum Deluxe Floor lamp through an ad in National Geographic. I also bought a very expensive panel of replacement light bulbs. I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the light. After some months of infrequent use, the lamp ceased to function (they are made in China, by the way). I disassembled it and found that it appeared to be very poorly constructed. I ended up having to throw it away and still have the panel of bulbs, which do not fit any other lighting fixture in my house."
1,In the dark with this lamp!,"The item arrived promptly and that is the last positive comment I can make. I unpacked it and installed the bulb per directions. I plugged it in and and it did not work. I followed all the trouble-shooting directions, and it still does not work. I am sending it back to Amazon today for a refund. Verilux is supposed to be a top-of-the line ""deluxe"" model, well this one fell way short of being anything but a dud! I'm not sure who did the quality control on this product..."
1,Too little light,"If you want a tiny amount of light very focused on a tiny area, then this lamp will do the trick. Otherwise, avoid, avoid. If I could return the thing, I would."
5,natural lighting,Best reading lamp for reading and crafting.Liked it so much I purchased a second floor lamp and considering a desk lamp
5,"Finally, a good looking reading lamp!","Well made as all Verilux items are, but also blends in well with other furniture!"
1,Unhappy Customer,"Verilux Original Natural Spectrum Deluxe Floor Lamp,IvoryNot at all as advertised. Light poor. Needtable lamp also to be able to read by.I wanted a reading floor lamp this is not what I need."
1,DO YOURSELF A FAVOR - STAY AWAY FROM THESE RIP-OFF SCAMMERS,"I bought two lamps from this company, floor lamp and desk lamp. Both have very weak light source, no more than 75 Watts equivalent, rating was 27W in fluorescent power. Personally I believe it's less than that. Anyways I decided to return it. Sent them via UPS. That was over 2 months ago. I still don't have refund. Had to file dispute with my credit card company. They are working hard to get my money from these scammers - why scammers?! Because they are claiming that received only one package, even after UPS tracking showed they received both items.Disgusting customer service( or actually the lack of it), liars and just dishonest people.If I could put -10 in rating I would do that.PLEASE, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR - DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM VERILUX COMPANY. PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS!"
2,Verilux repairs??,"A good reading floor lamp - while it WORKS! But finding a place to fix it - in Los Angeles - when it simply refuses to light - even with a new ""bulb""? No luck so far. Robert"
4,Great but wish it was just a few more inches taller,"I love this lamp. It is very handy as I use it when I am doing microbead hair extensions in my home based salon. I love storing my scissors, hair pins and other tools in the little caddy. It provides light so that I can see the tiny beads I use to do the hair extensions And I like resting my tools on the little table thing. It's great. I wish it was maybe about 12 inches taller so that I could bend the light and make it hover over the person's head as they sit in the chair so that I could see even more. Take a look at my pictures of it. It does provide more than enough lighting so that I am not straining my eyes but. The light is very very very bright. It also came with excellent packaging, and bulb."
1,Defective lamp,"Purchased floor lamp based on Verilux desk lamp that has performed flawlessly for years.Item was not manufactured very well, was a challenge to connect pole to base (hole alignment).Dim setting did not work.After lamp was placed in use it would shut off after approximately 10 minutes, turning switch off for a couple of minutes would sometimes solve problem.Returned lamp to Amazon."
1,Do not waste your time,"This is the second one shipped to me. The first was DOA. Now that I can turn it on, what a dim light, I can't see to read, it is like using a flash light."
5,Verilux Original Floor Lamp,This lamp is exactly what I was looking for. A lamp for reading and crocheting that wouldn't light up the whole room. It focus' the light on my lap projects. I am extremely happy with this item and highly recommend the lamp.
3,Okay for tasks,"I bought this lamp to knit by when my husband is watching television. It works for that task. However, the bulb blew after about 10 hours of use. So much for that 10,000 hour bulb. Plus, it looks like the alien from the original War of the Worlds movie. The only thing it's missing is that huge eye! I plan to put it in the basement and buy a better looking lamp for my living room."
1,stopped working after 15 minutes,"I sent this as a gift to a relative. I also ordered a spare bulb. Unfortunately, after only a few minutes, the light went out and wouldn't come back on, including with the spare bulb. So now an elderly relative has to fool with returning this. I am very disappointed."
1,Hidden damage to lamp which was in a pristine packaged box,"This lamp arrived in a very well packed box which I discarded in my recycling bin. After my recycling was picked up I realized that the base was cracked completely through. This was a purchase for a 93 year old who decided that she did not want or need this, so I am basically stuck with a lamp with a cracked base. Not a happy camper!"
5,Great lamps,We really like these lamps. They are not intrusive yet they offer the best possible light for reading I have experienced.
2,didn't last long,bulb failed after only about 2 mos. Bought new one and lamp still did not work. Threw it away. Will not order a new one.
4,"Great ""natural"" light source","The lamp emits a white light that helps my tired old eyes read. The style of the light looks somewhat futuristic & utilitarian - not for everyone's taste or decor. I was a little disappointed in its height - doesn't seem as tall as stated in specs, but it works fine even if it looks short.All in all, I like it."
2,Assembly problem and weak light,"I had read where some people had a problem with a small screw that attaches the pole to the base not lining up correctly. I assumed the people were ""assembly impaired"" and ordered the light anyway. The light we received had the same problem and you cannot shift the pieces any to make the holes meet up because there is a steel support in the base that fits inside of the pole to give more strength to the lamp pole. Before I returned it (my husband said he could probably fix the hole problem by drilling another hole), I installed the bulb and was very disappointed with the amount of light generated by the lamp. I needed it for sewing. I ended up purchasing a lamp at Lowes for a less money that put out a lot more light. And, it's better looking, too!"
3,Only one setting works,"The lamp is everything I asked for. I imagine it would work like it's advertised if both settings worked. However the high setting does nothing, doesn't even turn on the light. I kept it because the low setting is good enough to do most of what I want. I don't think it's worth the price."
1,"Very poor quality, low illumination","I bought two of the lamps from the Verilux site. One of the lamps had a mismatched screw hole, so the lamp could not stand on the base. Instead of returning the whole (heavy) lamp, I had to use my electrical drill to puncture a new hole in the metal so that it could be used as a floor lamp. The other lamp's light bulb stopped working after 3 months of less than 8 hours of use per week. It cost almost $25 per bulb! When I posted my review on their site, it was never published. It is very dishonest for them to only post the good reviews on their site. I suspect that those reviews were posted by the friends and employees of the company."
2,Not enough light,"I expected thiss light to solve my reading problems in my easy chair.It does not.The light covers too samll an area.I have subsequently ordered a 42 watt lamp (versus this 27 watt)Just isn't what I hoped it would be,Bob"
5,This is a wonderful education tool.,"My seven-year-old son is an excellent reader for his age group; however, he needed to improve his comprehension skills. He has been working with the Building Blocks workbook to increase his level of reading understanding. The workbook provides a variety of appealing methods to obtain a higher level of comprehension while also building vocabulary skills.This is a wonderful educational tool, which compliments the school curriculum while providing a positive learning experience at home."
3,small size,the ring is small compared to the way it suppose to look according to the pic...also the size is inaccurate ...im a 71/2 i ordered a 9 for my middle finger and it doesnt fit it only fits my marriage finger which is a 7 1/2. nice ring only wish it was accurate in size.
5,LOVE IT!,I love this ring! i wear it on my pointer and it is fairly adjustable so it fits very comfortably. it came very fast and i couldn't be happier with this purchase!
2,Two sizes smaller than size I ordered,I ordered a size 9 to fit my largest finger but it fits my size 7 finger. It's a really cute ring but the spiral is closer together than the photo. I guess you could spread it apart but I'm afraid doing that would make it smaller. Would really like the ring if it was the correct size.
4,Should be closed,"Ends should be matched. Perhaps better. Roll inside the coil to close it up. As well could be a bracelet covering the brace. Yet a little oval, perhaps ornamented by diamonds, etc. Ratinonal winding always getting closed over a torus. Then break the oval donut covered by the diamonded row. Need not to be a tight winding."
3,"Fair as an overview, not so good on specifics esp. DEN","Don't be taken in by the ""LDAP"" on the cover. The sections on the use of directories for maintaining QoS policy appear to have been cobbled from other sources, are spotty in the coverage and at least a year or so old. This book will provide a basic introduction to several of the different ways of managing bandwidth, but certainly won't help with deployment of directory-enabled network policy management or services."
2,"Decent Cast, Poor Direction","I was expecting a well-told story, but instead suffered through a plot that dragged and skipped about haphazardly."
5,Excellent method,I have many years of experience in dancing and I have to congratulate Mauricio Castro for being the first one in developing a system for all tango dancers.Beginners will find the fastest ways to learn and more advance dancers will have better understanding of the dance.
4,Gotham noir style!,"Ed Brubaker has this unique view of Selina and her guest cast of characters. Gotham's East End takes on such a noir-ish look under Ed Brubaker and the pencils of Cameron Stewart. This story had such deep sadness in it and a reality that seems impossible when involving the likes of Black Mask. As a villain he poses a good threat to Selina and I hope to see them square off again. This series, steered by Brubaker is the defining version of Catowman to me. The only drawback in this trade, to me, is the art was a little limited in the last chapter. Overall, it was still very good."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"In the third of Ed Brubaker's Catwoman trades, she continues on her merry way, and is still straddling the line between crime and crimefighting. She will rescue people from the police, and also hand hoods over to them. A bit of larceny for a good cause is not beyond her, either. However, when some unfans of hers come looking for a violent resolution, she has more than the normal number of problems."
2,Good Handbook for Counselors and Pre-Engineers,"This book is the cheering section for hish school physics teachers to encourage students to go into engineering. It uses the amusement park as a model to showcase the different disciplines within engineering. There is a good list of good reading, manufacturers, trade magazines, and the like."
2,Not a book for the rollercoater lovers,This book should not be confused as a book for someone who loves rollercoatsers and wants to learn more about them or just see lots of cool information or cool pictures of roller coasters. This is a book for engineering students.
5,Pure pianistic genius - A young Argerich,"Do yourself a favor and download this album while you can! This lady is a bona fide genius! She's like a young Argerich (not to mean the ""old"" Argerich is any worse!)! She's terrific!"
4,hair heroes,Love this book in really good shape. Not sure if it really is Michael Gordon's signature but I don't care.
2,good book good condition,I bought this used and bought it so I had a good book to get info from when doing reports at school. It us a good book and in good condition for being used.
1,"Looks great, but too much heat to actually use","I got this case for a HTPC setup because it looked great, and because I thought I could deal with surely minor cooling issues. I've owned SFF pc's in the past, and thought that anything that could fit an mATX board would probably be better than most. Unfortunately, with an AMD Athlon 2200 running stock, the idle temps alone varied between 61 and 68C! The same board and CPU holds at 39C in a mid-tower case. Under load, it was just too unstable to use. The power supply issues that others mentioned are the main culprit... there is less than 70mm of clearence, forcing the use of a low-profile heatsink and fan. If Antec had just made the case 10mm higher, it would've opened up a world of cooling opportunities.Quite a dissappointment. I had thought that Antec was a good brand to get, but I don't see how they could release a product with such problems."
3,nice case but QC is lacking,"This is a fairly nice miniATX case but QC seems to be lacking. Reviews elsewhere mentioned QC issues, particurally with screws being stripped.3 of the 4 expansion card cover screws on my case were stripped. Other issues are the total lack of any cable management inside the case. This is advertised as ""quiet"". It is no more quiet than my Antec tower."
1,Unhappy lamp-Don't Buy,"My light bulb burned out after a year. That seemed reasonable. I ordered a new bulb from Verilux. It burned out after a month. The company said it is warranteed for 30 days. They sure don't stand behind their product.Fred BiamonteBranford, CT"
1,NO REPAIR POSSIBLE? NO SERVICE CENTERS,"I've had my Happy Eyes 27 watt desk lamp, VD01, for about five years, and I've been happy with it. But one night a clumsy fumble knocked it into the floor, and it went out. I bought and installed a new bulb, with no luck. The light will not come on. I figured I'd broken a solder joint somewhere, and it could probably be easily traced and fixed, so I called them this morning to find a service center address. To my utter amazement and dismay, they told me tough luck. All I can do is throw that lamp away.I know that we live in a ""throw-away"" society, but come on! That lamp cost a lot of money, not to mention the bulb that I just bought, for absolutely nothing. I will never buy another Verilux product, no matter how good it is."
3,"Good lamp, but could be better",The lamp gives good light in a fairly concentrated area. My only complaint is that the flexible arm isn't strong enough to hold the light where I want it.
4,Great for students,"As a medical student my eyes are constantly glued to textbooks, but with this lamp my eyes are much less fatigued.I recommend this product for those who will be using this lamp for reading/studying purposes. If you just need a nice lamp for your desk then go with a cheaper option."
1,Worst product,"Some serious problem with the lamp. Probably the worst thing I have purchased on Amazon.1. several days after normal use, it started emitting an obnoxious smell similar to what laser printer would smell during printing. After 30 minutes, the room is filled with this smell causing headache and nauseous. I'm certain it is not the heat burning the plastic. For whatever reason, this smell cannot be good for health.2. the rubber feet material left circular brown marks on my daughter's otherwise beautiful white desk. Tried all kinds of cleaners but didn't help. Not only I cannot use this lamp because of the terrible smell problem, it also ruined my furniture.3. contacted manufacture. they want you to pay the shipping to them, as well as $18 return shipping back to you. Not worth it."
1,Suffers severe suckage,"We are very disappointed in this lamp. We paid a higher price for it a year ago. We found that it was stiff and difficult to adjust. It is big and ugly. It is not well-made- cheesy plastic. The light bulbs were hard to change. We didn't get the sense of any ""full-spectrum"" light.The good news is that after less than a year, it just stopped working. Now we have an excuse to throw it out and try again, with anything other than Verilux.(Although, strange as it may seem, the big yellow Verilux shop light I have in the basement works just fine. Maybe they should stick to industrial lighting, and steer clear of the bedrooms of the world...)"
4,Great lamp and customer service,"For some unknown reason, the diffuser grid that is meant to be fitted over the bulb had the fitting prongs more widely spaced than the holes in the lamp where they were meant to fit. I got in touch with verilux customer services and they were EXCELLENT. They sent me a replacement grid to try, but this had the same problem. They then offered to pay for me to return the lamp and send a new one. I declined this as I didn't need the grid that much.In summary, odd that the lamp had the wrong fittings, but a great lamp and great customer service."
4,Lamp serves it's purpose,I purchased this lamp for work. I work at a computer all day dealing with numbers and very small print (6 pt. fonts). It's perfect. I don't find it bottom heavy at all. There is no glare and I find it lights the area sufficiently. Much better than the overhead lighting in the office.
5,Best Lamp I've Ever Had,"I play alot of video games and do alot of programming on the computer but I like to keep the room dark with only a lamp lighting the keyboard. I used to buy cheap little lamps and I swear I'd have to change the bulbs every month or throw them away because they'd stop working.When I got this puppy, it saved the day. Has a high and low setting and the low setting is perfect for my desk. Have had it for 3 months and so far, not a single problem with it and I'm extremely happy.The only cons I can think of is that it's a little big so I can see people with small desks having a problem and that it's a bit pricey. If you look past those two things, you have yourself an amazing lamp."
3,Design over function won me over...,"I needed a small desk natural light (full spectrum) desk lamp for my office. Verilux is a relatively reliable brand name, so I purchased this desk lamp. Design, style, and color of the lamp is great. However, it does not emit as much light as I expected. The lamp has two settings: high and low, which in my opinion, differ only slightly in illumination. I give this product 3 out of 5 stars for low luminance, but the design, weight, and style are great. If you need natural, full spectrum ""task lighting"" this will do. For 8 hours of working in front of a computer, I'd suggest a lamp that delivers more brightness."
2,unreliable,"Lamp light could have been brighter, but was ok. It became unreliable after about a month, coming on infrequently when switched. Maybe just the luck of the pick, so will swap for same."
5,love my lamp!,"This is my first verilux lamp and I say it's a great investment. It's one of my favorite lamps now. comfortable, bright lighting. I do notice that it helps reduce eye strain. I have replaced my old desk lamp with this, and I love it!"
1,Broke after only 4 weeks,The grill over the bulbs keeps falling off after minimal use and only 4 weeks- I would like a refund or a replacement!
1,No more Verilux for me,This light only lasted about 6 weeks and then almost caught fire. This is the second Verilux light I have purchased that malfunctioned in the same manner. Not trying anymore of their products.
1,Selling bad merchandise,"Verilux Original Natural Spectrum Deluxe Desk Lamp, GraphiteHappen to me too, both my lamps failed to operate within 6 months. Have an originalbought from a retail store which has outlasted these two by a long time. Hardware Sales does notship in original boxes. Must be returned defective merchandise being sold for a low price. Notworth a penny if it does not work. Buy straight from amazon.com and pay the $79.95 for factorynew items.Roy Szanik"
1,Very poor quality upon arrival - call Hardware Sales before purchase,"I purchased 5 of these for our office. They arrived in water damaged boxes. Only 2 of the 5 had the grid diffuser with it. Some of them did not have instructions. One had a return tag on it that said it was returned because quality was not as expected. Another had an inventory tag from 2005. It is marketed as a full spectrum lamp, yet the material that it comes with says that it does not help with SAD, it is only meant for task lighting.I called Hardware Sales and they are issuing a call tag for return of the items. They seemed unaware of the quality problems, and blamed the company that they purchased the lamps from.Before you buy, I highly recommend calling Hardware Sales to see if they have sorted out this problem, and whether or not they are still shipping these damaged goods."
1,Toxic Smell,"This lamp has a toxic smell. I returned it based on this. It smells really bad. I gave it a few days, but smell would not go away.CAUTION: WARRANTY IS NOT 3 YEARS. When you get the box, the paperwork inside box says 1 year. Don't waste your money on this lamp.FYI: This is a pretty big lamp."
4,Great light.,"I like the light, but the only ""con"" comment is the lication of the on-off switch. It's located on the bottom side near the light, which is a bit inconvenient."
3,Decent quality,"Although its light appears to be nature, the base is not as stable as I expected -- when I push the supporting stick of the light too forward, the base will loss its balance. It would be better if the base is made of heavier material to counter the weight of the upper portion of the light."
1,A terrible piece of equipment,Shortly after receiving this lamp it started to flicker. I could bumb it and it would work sometime. I decided to order a new bulb thinking it was just a fluke. Not cheap. Did not help. After six months I have discarded. One of the worst products I have ever purchased.
5,"good light, good quality , but shape of base can be improved","I've uses my lamp for about 5 years now. My home office is kind of dark so I have this light on most of the day while working on my computer. I like the color of the light it gives. The diffuser is a good design which makes the bulb ""invisible"". I was using a floor version for my desk, but just moved the floor version to the couch (and it works well there, sufficiently bright for reading), so I am ordering a desk version for the desk.After getting the desk version: The only negative I have is about the shape of the base. It has a convex top, making it impractical to put anything on. And the base is quite large compared to typical desk lamps. Given my crowded desk top this is not a small waste of realestate. I imaging it wouldn't be hard for the manufacture to make it into a flat top or even a shallow tray."
4,Nice and comfortable but expensive,"Have been using it for last 4-5 months. Joined school which means lot of reading and laptop work, so I purchased albeit the price tag was high. So, far I found it decent. Bluish light, two brightness setting, reasonably stable on the table. This light is good for reading and laptop. But if you want light spread across a larger table, this is not the right one.Update after 2 years of use: the plastic cover for the lamp got loose and keeps falling - a nuisance. Otherwise, no complaints."
3,"Nice, but lacking brightness for my close-up work","After reading the reviews and comparisons on the manufacturers web site, I thought I had found the perfect lamp to spend my many tedious hours examining fingerprints with.Needless to say, I was quite disappointed to find that this lamp lacked the brightness that I had thought it would have. Even though this lamp has a two-way switch that enables one to change between a high & low lamp output... I found that I had to have the lamp closer to my work than I wanted in order to achieve the brightness that I required.I also found the base to be somewhat ""tippy"" when the light portion of the lamp was not adjusted parallel the base.In fairness to the manufacturer, this lamp did cast an even light that was comfortable to to read under for extended periods of time.Would I buy this lamp again... probably not, especially at the retail prices they are selling for."
2,Hmmmmmmmm.,"I bought this lamp because it says it doesnt give off any glare and is easy on the eyes for reading, doing crafts, sewing........... Well it doesnt giove off much light either!!!! So you need another source of light in your work area also......... I didnt think it would fill up the room with beautiful NATURAL light but c'mon.........all in all its an overpriced night light!!!"
5,weatherstripping,"quality weatherstripping, cushy and keeps the cold air out. betting it will keep the cool air inside in the summer."
4,Swedes Rock,"The Swedes certainly know how to create music and Broder Daniel is one prime example of that. Their rock/alt/indie sound is unlike very few albums that I've heard. Almost Brit, almost New York underground scene. Altogether they create a great, new sounding music that should be given a chance over here in the states.Some people seem to have been complaining about the accents and their abilities to speak English. If anything I think these ""failings"" only add to the European, funky sound that Broder Daniel gives on the album. It's a plus, not a minus.Be sure to check out ""Whirlwind"" and ""Superstar"", great tracks. Try something new and give Broder Daniel a chance!"
1,no correct spec stupid ad,"the spec given here is package dimension, yet user needs to know the product dimension or how long it covers, width so one determine cap shingles. None."
3,Still just a teapot,"Although it is a very nice teapot, sturdy, dishwasher safe, etc., in the end I didn't find its extra features to be that great. The tea-holding insert doesn't allow the water to circulate freely through the leaves for a good steep, and the mouth of the insert is so small that it makes cleaning out larger-leaf tea quite a challenge. Used without the insert, however, just letting the leaves swirl freely and then pouring out through a strainer, works fine and as such it is thoroughly satisfactory"
5,Very Happy,"This is a great teapot. It works well, looks nice, and holds enough tea for two. I'm very happy with my purchase!"
4,super big tea kettle,"I drink chinese tea leaves and bought this super big tea kettle. It serves my needs quite well. I noticed some dripping but it does not bother me too much. The kettle retains heat very well, and easy to clean. I don't often use the strainer because I want my tea leaves to be fully opened in the water. And the strainer is a little bit small compared to the huge kettle.In a word, it is a good tea kettle, beautiful and adorable."
1,Too damned purple! (Aubergine),"This is NOT Aubergine, a dark purple like the color of eggplant skin, but it is a light, bright purple. Sitting on my kitchen countertop, it is a very formidable sight first thing in the morning; glowing, shimmering in kitchen flourescent lighting. Caveat emptor, unless you're color blind or really like bright purple."
1,Have Waited for 2 YEARS for this to Ship!!!!,"I have waited for TWO YEARS for this to ship. I originally ordered back in 2005, but for some reason it won't ship. I keep getting new estimates on the ship date.AMAZON, CATCH A CLUE! Don't list this as available for immediate shipment if you can't ship it to me in TWO YEARS!!!!"
5,Daily Life in the Early West in the Words of Women,"This book is one you don't want to finish because it is spell binding in it's personal detail. The stories are in the words of the women who lived the exciting, frigntening and heroic lives in the mid to late 1800's in the west. Life in mining camps, on isolated ranches and in the small towns and cities make for fascinating reading. This is one book I will read again and again."
5,best buy,"I used my new electric skillet for the 1st time last night and I am very pleased with the selection we made in purchasing it. It was very easy to use, had enough room for the meal I was preparing, heated to the temperature I needed quickly, was easy to clean. Another feature I liked very much was the lid. It rests in an upright position so I don't have to lay it down on the counter and I also liked the see through window so you can see what you are cooking."
2,non-stick linning needs to be made better,"I have owned 4 electric skillets over the past 8 years. I love to use them when I cook large portions of foods. Needless to say that the non-stick linning really sucks. It bubbles up and peel off leaving the skillet useless. My last electric skillet was giving to me at Christmas 2003 from my husband, again the non-stick linning peeled off, this one only lasted till November of 2003. Untill some kind of better non-stick linning in made I will not buy another one of these skillets. A person pays good money for these items you would think that the non-stick linning would last longer then 1-2 years. I only use wooden cooking tools on mine and they still go bad. Maybe I use my skillets too much.. Nope don't think so. I wish someone would come up with a better non-stick linning, one that would last for 5 or more years. Maybe I am ask for too much. Nope don't think so."
3,Great skillet except for teflon coating,"We have now owned two of these in the past 5 years and the non-stick lining in both has bubbled and peeled off. At first, we thought one of the kids had been using metal forks or something with the first one and scratched it all up. But when we got the second and the same thing happened we realized it was the coating itself. It has bubbled and peeled away all over and we've had to quit using it. It cooked wonderfully, but unless the lining is improved, I'll never buy another (and these larger skillets are hard to find)."
5,Perfect Gift For A Spell Collector,"Not for the squeamish, but it is a great little books of spells. If you are a wiccan or any other fluffy type this is not for you. I have to say as a collector that there are a lot of spells that I haven't come across before. So for the curious who like to expand past your average spellbook pick this one up.Some chapter names to give you a hint:In Matters Of LoveThe Making Of MischiefDealing With DemonsandHealing Methods"
2,Meh...,"These pillows are merely okay, although the sewing quality is amatureish and sloppy--uneven, thus making the pillow covers crooked. Also, I ordered two of them: the first looking exactly as pictured, but the second being a different color altogether. Not cool at all, but for the price, they still look fairly decent on my couch."
4,Great Kit,"I have a Mazda 3, with these lights looks really cool, But I must say that there are no much instruction inside box, one or two tubes came a little bit open but I seal them with duck tape, of course you could also use glue if you had this problem.The led are really bright, some times the remote control doesn't work at the first time, but trust me if you want your car to look really cool at night buy them you wont regret it.PS: my car dealer in Guatemala made the installation for me, if you had a Mazda 3, I strongly suggest that you take your car to the dealer, they made a really nice job, and very cheap by the way."
3,Alright product,"I got the product and hooked it up fast. It was all cool and awesome for a day or so. Then, rain came and the light fuse blew out. I thought no problem just need a new fuse. I bought one and put it in and now the blue led lights only work. I spent a total of $109, which is still better than the single color underglow price at my local shop. It's an alright product, and I wouldn't say its great. Overall I'll give the product 3 stars, mainly because of the weakness of the tubes."
1,I got a lemon,"I ordered this kit several months ago (Sept 2008) and just got around to installing it recently (Dec 2008).I installed this inside my home, behind my home theater system. It looked really great - for about 2 days. After that, my green LEDS no longer functioned. This rendered my 7 color unit a 3 color unit.The company is very unreasonable with their warranty. They expect me to pay shipping both ways to get this fixed. It would be cheaper just to buy a new kit! I won't be purchasing any more junk from LEDGLOW. I will be sticking with a reputable compnay (Oznium).I wrote a review on their website, but apparently they only post positive feedback.I guess you get what you pay for... be carefull if you purchase this kit."
5,Great!,"This kit works great! Careful not to get the wires to close the ur exhaust though. If you do short the wires for the light bars, it will usually just short out the fuse rather than fry the box. DO NOT OVERRIDE THE FUSE. Other than that its an awesome kit and i really do reccomend this to anyone looking to put some underglow on their car. The rating for this SHOULD NOT be that low. One more thing... My remote battery went dead pretty quick and if you need a new one, the only place i could find one is OReilly."
3,lights,"i ordered million wireless led underbody light kit and had it hooked up and it only has one color,i was a little disapointed in it,this is the only thing i ever bought from here i was disapointed with."
1,not good,Supposed to be wireless but wires from the batery to the lights had to Get another set sent out because it was lost by ups
3,wordy,this book has good information if you can find it. maybe the author got paid by the number of words
3,cholesterol cure?,"There is a lot of research in this book - you can try all the recommendations and change the way you eat and it might help a bit. But when it comes down to it, if you have high cholesterol you'll most likely end up on cholesterol lowering medication. I lived by this book for 2 years and my Dr said I needed to get on medication, it's most likely hereditary. At least I now know what can elevate cholesterol and I try to avoid consuming certain foods and eat healthy. In the end, we're all gonna die from something, just like the author."
5,Worked for me,"When a doctor saw my cholesterol had dropped almost 25% in a month, he asked, ""What are you taking for it?""I told him that I had just bought a book, and followed the directions. He was amazed!."
5,the best advice!,"I've ordered this book before--I lend it out and replace it again and again. My friends always keep their copies because they have the same experience I have (and they want to keep the recipes on hand). Using its advice, I've successfully lowered my cholesterol dramatically without the dangerous drugs that are prescribed everywhere today. It's realistic, easy-to-read, and helpful."
3,A bit confusing,This book is O.K. but a bit confusing. I find more information at my doctors office than I did in this book. I feel it's a bit contradictory.
4,book review,"i got the book for my wife.her colesteral is high.she wanted to see what was out there for diets etc.what food she could eat,what was good and what was bad.it does the job. thank you. roger"
5,The Thirteenth Tribe lives on,"This is a brilliant summary of wildly disparate sources regarding a strange topic of medieval history. It was notorious when it came out and is the bedrock of non-specialist knowledge about this fascinating subject. This is one of those books that gets passed around forever. If you ever wondered where today's Jews probably came from, or just wanted to know an utterly amazing part of Eurasian history, this is your book. Long may it wave."
3,Can't escape childhood problems,"Scientific enough but zionist-oriented and thus partial to Jews,after all Koestler is a Jew himself.The layman will probably be attracted by Koestler's little tale but the knowledgeable will definitely shy away from it.Take it with a lot of salt."
4,History of the Khazar Empire,"Intellectually challenging study of the Khazar Empire, its conversion to Judaism, and its (mostly warlike) interactions and intermarriages with the Rus, Magyar, and Bulgar tribes to the North and West, and with the Muslims and Byzantines to the South. Original Muslim sources are quoted when the empire was at its height, from the 9th-11th Century. The Empire was known as far away as Spain. After this time, it was defeated by the Rus Empire centered in Kiev, descendents of the Vikings, and the rest of the book is devoted to possible dispersion theories, suggesting that most of the Khazars dispersed to the newly forming cities of Eastern Europe. Koestler gives detailed evidence for this, part of which is that the Jews have always been much more populous in Eastern Europe than they ever were in Western Europe. The last part of the book discusses genetic variation which was a consequence of the Jewish concentration in the ghettos of Eastern European cities."
4,Good job Mr. Koestler,"The only problem I had with the book is that it was sort of drawn out and wordy, but the content I think important. Ashkenazim (90% of modern Jews) was a son of Gomer and Gomer a son of Japheth, son of Noah. Shem was the son of Noah where the term semite (shemite) is derived. Thus modern Jews in mass are not Semites. But as the other reviewers have agreed, the world nation of the Jews are a mixture of many peoples, including the Khazars, which inturn became a mixed people. What I find revalent is that in Deut. 23:2 of the Bible, it states that a bastard cannot enter into the Kingdom of the Lord for 10 generations. The word bastard translates into the Hebrew as mamzer. Mamzer means mongrel, mixed. Thus Koesler's work is extremely significant. The Jews living in the land of Palentine today, by God's declaration, are legally not the children of the promise, they are still mixed to this day. It is easy to see why Koestler was murdered shortly after the release of this book."
1,outdated book,"The book is interesting, and at the time of its publishing was probably very controversial but his theory that most Ashkenazi Jews are descendents from the Khazar empire and not from the middle east has been proven false by genetic testing in the last 2 decades. (see the excellent work ""Jews of Khazaria"" Kevin Alan Brook, ""DNA, & Tradition the genetic link to the ancient Hebrews"", and hundreds of other scientific papers. This book belongs in the flat earth society library.Don't waste your money if you are interested in scholarly learning about the Khazars."
1,And the gaping hole in this theory is...,only the Khazar elite converted to the Jewish faith there are plenty of archeological expeditions that have uncovered burials from the same period that are monotheistic in origin. the experts of Molecular Population Genetics would also have something to say on the matter.
4,"could be more thorough, but good manual overall","I have used the manual extensively in collaboration with You Tube videos and mechanics Q and A's. It has been a nice addition to my information collection after buying my Firebird project muscle car. I do wish it had a better section on electrical wiring, but overall am very pleased with it, would recommend it to anyone working on a muscle car era firebird."
3,So-So Followup To His Great First Album,"I was a little disappointed in this work, which is pleasant to listen to but nowhere near as interesting as his remarkable solo debut, Alfagambetizado. That album is highly recommended. There is also background material about Brown and the whole Bahian music scene in the book ""The Brazilian Sound,"" of great use in understanding this music."
3,"Frustrating, enjoyable, and thought-provoking - as usual","This new album by Brown drops some of the needless Ur-speak lingual complexity of ALFAGAMABETIZADO, as well as the massed drums of that album, in favor of an approach that seems more pop on the surface. Some Chic-styled funk, uptempo reggae accented by Bernie Worrell's keyboards, lush orchestrations reminiscent of Nelson Riddle's work with Sinatra, Carnaval-meets-Sepultura, various older Brazilian traditions...If nothing else, the disc is a marvel of continuity despite its eclectic nature. Brown's lyrics should have been translated to English (ditto for the last album)because, despite his occasional polyglot excesses, he is a strong, original writer, capable of dipping into Greek mythology, the wide basin of Brazilian idiomatic speech, and the onomatopeic possibilites of mixing English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. U.S. critics should by all means be more aware of this when they pan his albums."
3,A competent follow up to a masterpiece.,"Still impressive and way ahead of most North American similar output in terms of originality and freshness,Brown's follow up to 1997's stellar'Alfagamabetizado'is a pleasant,eclectic,and intelligent collection of Brazilian and world music,yet somehow lacking the spark and the urgency of his fabulous debut."
1,Hype,"I have listened to this guy over two albums and I just don't get it. Why all the hype? He's O.K. but certainly no trendsetter, like Veloso, Gil, etc. At least Marisa Monte is producing highly listenable albums, if they do tend to veer toward AOR-slick. Skip it."
2,"KEEPS YOU IN SUSPENSE FOR AN ENDING, BUT THERE ISN'T ONE!!","James Herbert is one of my favorite authors because of his grisly detail, and the book I read before this was the Fog. Upon reading it, I felt like I was reading it all over again. I read this book, and was very disappointed from it. James Herbert builds a book out of old ideas. The story is good, but the plot is not thought over enough."
2,Good but alot like 'The Fog',"I thought that this book was very good, although it was very simliar to the Fog, which made it a bit boring. But none the less, a good gory book!"
5,Unputdownable.,"As the title suggests, this is a story which explores the darker side of human nature. People coming into contact with a dark force carry out their innermost longings. Full of strong characters, suspense and excitement, plus the genuinely disturbing knowledge that anybody could be harbouring unpleasant thoughts of murder, rape and violence. A well-written and unputdownable book."
2,dark repitions,okay. herbert is a talented writer. good descriptions at times. but that's not enough. this book is supposed to center around the plot. it does not. instead there are a lot of unnecessary murders and murderers described. the plot develops slooooowly. sorry.
1,i didn't get much out of it,"I bought this book, because I read in another book that it was a good source of knowledge on creating books. Perhaps it is, but I didn't get much out of it. I found it really tough to understand, and I think one must be a professional to use it."
1,Warning: fire hazard,"We got our Samsung microwave as a wedding gift in 1997. I would have been fine if it just stopped working after five years, but this one shorted out and then caught fire while we were heating soup. My husband broke out our fire extinguisher for the first time to put the fire out. The company says it will likely replace the unit after an inspection, but we have to pay to ship it back. And, frankly, I'm not so sure I'm in favor of having a replacement, especially after reading the other reviews and remembering that my parents have had the same microwave for 15 years!"
2,Different Model - Same Problem,"I have a model MW1060SA Samsung microwave that my son gave me for Christmas two years ago. About 6 months ago, the door started sticking and was very difficult to open. Then, we noticed that the paint under the plate had started bubblibng and peeling, exposing bare metal. I thought at first that something had spilled but when I looked closer, the paint was peeling and there is rust on the bottom of the microwave. I came to this site to see if others had this problem and after reading the reviews, I unplugged my microwave and will toss it tomorrow. I have always used Sharp microwaves in the past and will probably get another one this time."
1,Poor choice,"Looking for a good product? Not this one. Check Consumer Reports.org for decent machines. I just ordered a Kenmore 6325 that is Consumers top rated macine, only 10 bucks more than this Samsung. There are many low reviews of this product which are accurate and should be heeded. We had similar problems not long after it was purchased (i.E. sparking) and had a lot of trouble with a truculent, unpleasant local warranty provider Samsung sent us to. After the repair it is now shorting out again. We owned this product 1 year and it is going in the trash. Even if the warranty was still in effect the hassle and bad attitude of the warranty company is not worth the trouble. I highly recommend doing research and finding a good product, which I wish I had done the first time."
1,Keep children away!,"This model worked well for less than a year. During a routine popcorn making session -- with no warning -- one side of the unit flamed up. Luckily I was near the microwave at the time and was able to disconnect it from the power supply before we sustained any damage outside the unit. In light of my experience, and those of others whose reviews appear here, I would not recommend this unit, especially not for a home where children might be heating snacks or popping corn."
2,fire risk,"Well, I don't actually have this microwave, but I'm researching other models now. I have a Samsung microwave from a few years ago, but now we're getting the blue arcs of light in the microwave which is the prelude to a fire. I have to say though that while this microwave worked, it was THE BEST model I have ever used. It had the most pleasant beep and easy to use controls. I'd love to buy another Samsung, but if other people are experiencing the same sort of issue, I'll have to stay away and I'd advise you to do the same."
2,suddently stopped working,"I bought this used. It was a year old. After 6 months, it just stopped working. It was working just fine before that. Oh well, at least I only paid $20 for it."
1,SCARY--DON'T DO IT PEOPLE!,"In a word--explosive. This is the most dangerous piece of equipment I've ever owned. It started burning up when we weren't even home. Nobody was using the thing. Thank God we got home in time to unplug it and avoid further disaster. If you have any care for the safety of yourself or those in your household, stay away from this horrible microwave."
2,Starts by itself all right,"OK, nice to see in a wierd sort of a way that I'm not the only one. Yes, it starts by itself and sometimes resets the time to all 4's. But it was good for at least two years. Not good...I'm keeping it unplugged."
1,It starts by itself,"I had mine the longest of the reviewers here before the problems began....for about 4 years. I loved it until it did the beeping, then the numbers in a row (sometimes 3333, sometimes 8888 sometimes 4444....) and then the microwave would just start on its own. But we would just unplug or clear the screen and it can start normally again. But recently, it won't even start. Sometimes I get lucky and upon re-plugging the screen says 2.46 and starts to go so I just let whatever I need heat up for 2.46 minutes. We just bought another microwave and now I am trying to find out what to do with used microwaves."
4,I can explain the fire hazzard problems,"My daughter bought me a Samsung microwave for Christmas in 2001, and it worked wonderfully, but we started getting arcing, and I noticed that the epoxy finish on the interior under the turntable was breaking down after just a few months of use!!Definately a manufacturing defect, I contacted Samsung, who sent me another microwave - which did the same thing, although it took a little longer!Mechanically, they are great for the money, but you have to be prepared to repaint the interior with good quality paint to prevent the metal from arcing through if you buy one."
1,"Disappointed July 25, 2003","We received this microwave as a wedding gift in Sept of 2000. The microwave had be working just great until 7/21/03 when I was defrosting some meat. The microwave started making popping noises and sparks turned into a flame of fire. The fire came from that little opening on the right upper side within. I immediately put the fire out informed my husband and the microwave was trashed. We were really shocked at this happening because had I not been in the kitchen to see this, the fire could have escalated bigger. I rated one star because this makes this microwave unpredictable. If you buy the Samsung make sure you are in the area at all times you use it!"
1,Junk!,It hasn't even been a month and this stupid thing almost caught fire. I was cooking popcorn and suddenly smelled something funny. When I opened the door the microwave was burnt on the inside. It makes no sense to me why this happened. I won't buy another one.
2,Almost 3 years,"We bought this almost 3 years ago, and it worked flawlessly until today. It stopped heating with no warning at all. I think we'll look for a different brand this time around."
2,doesn't last long,"this microwave did not last for more than a year. it wasn't like it was used a whole lot (at least twice a day). i only used it mostly to heat left overs and for defrosting meat, etc. I hardly ever cook a full meal in this microwave. All of a sudden, without any sign of degradation, it stopped working. When u put something on the microwave, in would turn on and the carousel would spin and the counter display would show as if it's working but it doesn't heat the food anymore. So needless to say i am done with Samsung as far as microwave is concern. I'm gonna try out Panasonic next."
2,ka-put!,"i swear samsung manufactured this microwave to last 366 days, because mine went ka-put right after the warranty expired. it started to sizzle and smoke from the internal parts when i was microwaving popcorn. blechhh!"
1,Not safe....automatically starts itself...,"Not the exact model (MW945WB) but very similar. I've had the same problems mentioned by others here. My unit automatically starts a 2 or 3 minute cycle all by itself at random times. I learned this while pulling all night study sessions. I would be working away and hear beeps coming from the kitchen and the microwave would start running. With nothing in it! By the time I'd make it to the kitchen to shut it off, it would already smell slightly smokey. Now I have to keep it unplugged except when I'm running it for piece of mind. This seems like a big saftey hazard. I'm waiting for Samsung to recall these, but I'll probably throw it in the trash before then and just buy a different brand."
2,haunted microwave,"here it is 4:23am.. i wake up to the sound of beeps in my apartment. at first i thought it was the carbon monoxide detector, but the sound was all too familiar. i jump up and run in the kitchen expecting to see someone standing there pressing buttons??? but no one was there so i thought for sure it was a ghost. my microwave had one minute and 41 seconds remaining on the clock. obviously, i couldnt sleep after this.. my heart is still racing. i decided to google a microwave starting on its own and wouldnt you know i have this exact item. i have to admit, this microwave works great. i have had this microwave for almost four years and never had a problem... heats up my food to perfection. BUT, i do not recommend this product if you have a heart problem. Samsung should definitely recall this item or fix that one flaw."
1,Turns on by itself,I've had the same problem with my Samsung microwave turning on by itself. At first I thought I was losing my mind or my house was haunted! So I'm glad to see there are others with the same problem - I'm going to contact Samsung asap and see what they intend to do about this.
3,It starts on its own.,"I have had the thing for almost 2 years. I have liked it and had no problems whatsoever. Then last night it started on its own... three times! It was kind of unnerving. I was sleeping (2 am) when I heard 2 beeps and the thing start. I initially thought I was making it up, but then my wife said ""Is that the microwave?!"" Being the good husband I went and turned it off and thinking little of it and went back to bed. Then it did it again. I have no kids, no pets, and thankfully there was no intruder turning on our microwave just to freak us out. When it happened the third time I decided to unplug it and call it a night. Today I wanted to see if it was just power surges last night or if it really was the microwave. It did it again for a forth time and I am calling it the microwave. Too bad I kind of liked the thing. It is kind of cool for freaking out my wife though.Happy Halloween!"
2,FIRE HAZZARD!!!,"The thing cooks ok but you have to unplug it when not in use. Come on, there are safer ways to cook food. It seriously will just start running at random times if I forget to unplug it and when that happens it gets REALLY HOT!! I was looking for the recall or class action suit on this one. Do NOT buy this one until you hear of Samsung fixing the problem."
5,Great microwave,"We've had this microwave oven for at least 5 years now and it has been working great. Has been reheating, defrosting and cooking properly.Still looks brandnew after all this time."
5,Five years and still cooking,"I haven't had any of the problems that the other reviewers have experienced, although I will certainly keep my eye on the microwave now that I have read these reviews. We've used this microwave heavily for over five years. No paint bubbling, no fires, no problems. The light burnt out once, but I ordered a replacement light and it works great. Occasionally it heats unevenly, but I've yet to encounter a microwave that heats things completely evenly."
3,Not as great as expected...,We've used this microwave since January 2001. It started out wonderful. But within the last 6 months it's been tempermental. Each time we use the microwave we have to find that *certain* way to press the button to open the door. Otherwise we just keep pushing the button and the door won't open. The start button has also decided to be fickle and we have to try a couple times to press the button *just right* to get it to start. Luckily we haven't had any fires yet.
1,I agree this microwave stinks,"We bought this microwave about a year ago. One day I tried to heat some water for tea. It ran, but didn't heat. I called Samsung and was told the part was under warrenty but we would have to pay the cost of labor at one of their certified repair shops. They refused to give us the part so we could fix it our self. I can see by the other reviews that Samsung must be aware of this defective product. I would strongly recomend against buying this microwave or anything else from Samsung."
2,Replacing a MW6580W,"Not exactly the same microwave, but in the same family. I was lucky, I guess, because mine lasted almost 2 years. My mom has an old GE that's still clicking after 15 years. Neat features while it worked, but with a life expectancy of 1-2 years, I'll pick a better brand for this replacement."
4,Lasted 10 years,"This microwave finally died on me after about 10 years. Worked well. I didn't realize how often we used it until it died, but it was used frequently."
3,great design - but be careful,"Great designed sandals and I can see how they could be very comfortable for some peoplebut be sure of your foot sizing before ordering. I wear a 13 across the board and have neverhad trouble with any shoes or sandals I've purchased but apparently my feet are 'taller' than avgfor this manufacturer because squeezing into these unadjustable sandals was hell. They are very tight and unforgiving.Length wise they were correct but they were the most painful things I've ever worn.The material they use for the toe strap is very sharp, so be sure you are going to fit before ordering. Drive over to Pac Sun and trythese on or have to deal with the return process like I am."
4,Comfy,A good pair of sandals for the price...It could get wet unlike my pair of Land Rover sandals :)
5,Fits like a glove!,"After years of never really liking flip flops or sandals because my feet would hurt after a long walk, I found these and they are the best! I'm able to wear them when walking a long time. Fits like a glove and provides a great arch support especially for those sensitive feet. I'd recommend this for women also - I wear 8 mens, 10 womens. This is my 2nd pair and will continue to buy this as long as they are available."
4,Probably the only MP3 Player with built in FM radio.,"ADVANTAGES : Exceptionally Small, FM Radio, Easy to use PC software. DISADVANTAGES : Radio is awkward to tune, and the reception is poor. 32Mb of memory for MP3 files is just not enough, Volume control is poor, making it impossible to play at low volumes."
4,Easy and good,"It was less than 15 minutes and I had it completely assembled. It has been a great help going vertical.It is good for lighter bikes. If you have a very heavy mountain bike that weighs close to 30-35 lbs, it may not be the best option for you.Road bike, commuter bikes, no problem."
2,Good service poor product,"Very weak rack, leans badly with 3 lightweight mountain bikes. Had to reinforce several holes with much larger screws and it still leans. Customer service provided me with spare parts at no charge, but the rack is not well built. It is for small bikes only. I would have bought the Brookstone rack if it was available at the time of purchase."
5,Basement Jaxx are the best,"These video's are awesome. Only missing You don't know me, then it'd be the best collection ever."
2,A dated work,"Although accurate in its content for the time it was written, this book is too old to be a help with the variety and complexities of the fast-changing world of Print-on-Demand in 2011."
3,Book has no Index!,"""The Clearly Confusing World of Self-Publishing & POD just got more confusing without an Index - a ""Table of Contents"" may save the author money, but there's no substitute for a good index. ."
4,"A book to curl up with on a cozy, relfective night....","The emotion of Barger's poems is sometimes startling, sometimes wrenching, and always poignant. This is a collection of a man's best and dearest memories and life lessons told in melodic and down-to-earth verse that warms the heart while capturing the imagination. These poems take the reader deep into the life story of a struggling, rejoicing poet while he opens his soul to words, rhythm, and the meaning of existence."
4,Nice Tiger Strip pattern,A nice light weight Skull Cap. It fits me well and I wear it for work and riding. This item was priced right.
1,Avoid TigerDirect!!! They are crooks!,"This product worked great for about a month, then it completely went dead, and was as worthless as the battery I replaced, giving you about 10 seconds before the machine totally shut off if you unplugged the AC. I called, and Tigerdirect said there was nothing they could do, but they instructed me on what to say to IBM Tech Support, regarding when I made the purchase and what not. The kicker is they wanted me to lie! I stayed on the line while the TigerDirect person connected me with IBM, and made the introduction to the IBM Tech Support person, he gave them my laptop serial number, (which should have nothing to do with warranty on an aftermarket battery!) and then turned it over to me, then dropped off the line! I told the IBM person, who mind you knew everything about me from my serial number, that I was being asked to lie in order to cheat them out of a battery by a rep at TirgerDirect, I applogized on TigerDirect's behalf and hung up. That was a $65 mistake!"
1,Did I read the same book????,"Ok I get it, the author is writing their own reviews or its their family members and friends, because there is not NO way in hell this book should have gotten five stars. First, the synopsis says there is a family curse. What family curse?? Just because the women in the family has green eyes that makes the men fall in love with them.... oh brother!This story lacked all the elements of a good novel. The main/secondary characters were boring, the storyline was awful. The heroine (Ariel) was constantly yelling at the hero (Jarad). One minute she wanted to be with him and the next she was yelling at him. The scenes with the ex-boyfriend was unnecessary, it felt like the author threw that in to fill in the story. I don't know why Jarad even fell in love with Ariel, she was constantly bickering. This is one novel I have read and forgotten."
2,DIDN'T WORK VERY LONG,"I was going to keep looking for this item and reorder it when it became available until I read the review from lady from Louisville, Kentucky. Just like her I had this oven for about three or four months - used it about five times and it just quit heating up. Maybe the manufacturer should look into this. I too, had thought that I may have gotten a dudd until I read her review.Diane -"
1,not Rival quality,"I bought this in Nov 2001 (because I have a crockpot that I love but it is a little too small for turkey roasts, large chickens, etc.) it worked for less than a year & it is next to impossible to get ahold of Rival customer service. You pay for the product and then they want you to pay to ship it back...I will never buy Rival products again."
2,Worked great for a while!,"I too was disappointed when my roaster quit working. It looked like sparks were coming from the bottom. I purchased this roaster in the store. It worked great for about 6 months. In that time, I used it probably 4 times. Heating up for the first time the pan started smoking, but after about 15 minutes it quit. The manufacturer should look into their design. Maybe something needs to be changed."
4,Just bought at a yard sale,Just roasted some chicken legs. They came out great. I am planning to roast a small port roast tomorrow. It heats up very quick and remains hot all around.
5,Couldn't Put it Down,"I recently read Faith Sullivan's ""The Cape Ann"" and wanted to read more about Lark, her mother Arlene, and her aunt Betty. I was delighted to discover ""Gardenias"" which follows the trio from Minnesota to California and tells of Lark's growning into a young teenager during WWII. This is a very satisfying read!"
4,service,"Your service was great. The book came quickly and in good order.Your feedback is so greatly appreciated and I truly enjoyed having you as my customer.Most sincerely,bellabook/Nancie"
4,Smokey Robinson - Tell Me Tomorrow,"Songs Include :""Tell Me Tomorrow""""Let Me Be The Clock""""Vitamin U""""There Will Come A Day ( I'm Gonna Happen To You )""""It's Been A Long Time ( Since I Been In Love )""""If You Want My Love""""In My Corner""""Old Fashioned Love"""
4,"Very nice, solid kettle","It's big but most important, it works on my induction burner. The lid is very (too?) snug and I like the one piece construction of the body so no leaks! I like solid construction and believe in buying such items once - or at least having it last a very long time! I received it in early November 2012 and my boyfriend has used it more than me (daily morning tea) but we're both satisfied with it. It has a clean look and still looks new after a couple of months. Because a whistler is a better design (safeguard) and the handle is welded on, not screwed/bolted, I gave it 4 stars. As suggested in another review, I'll use a timer. But I couldn't find a kettle that I would have complete confidence after reading so many disappointing reviews up and down the price range. The price for this is very reasonable compared to the expensive options, and a better value in my opinion."
5,Love this tea kettle,"I enjoy having friends over for tea/lunch and wanted a tea kettle that would fill 2-3 of my tea pots at once. This one fills four of them and it's great. I do miss having a whistle to let me know it's boiling, but it's worth it for the convenience of boiling so much water at once. It's also a very nice looking kettle."
3,BIG???,"This is a quality product, but way too big for the average household. I could easily boil a dozen eggs in this, but it is much too large to use on a daily basis for tea!"
1,False advertising,"This is advertised as 50g of pure powder. Lets assume a serving is 200mg, (actually should be 600mg per serving for optimal results), so at 5 servings per gram there should be 150 servings total."
4,A Breath of Fresh Air,"With undeniable skills, Badi will surely gain new listeners. One of my favorites is track #3, ""One."" Two others I like and can listen to over and over is ""Estrangeiro em mim"" and ""Valse D' Amelia."" Listen carefully because each song tells a story-either vocally or musically. The multi-talented artist gives listeners an ear full.If you're looking for something new and different, take a chance and give this 14 track CD a chance."
3,Mr. Coffee bean grinder,"This thing is so cheap, looks like stainless steel but is silver plastic. Barely has enough room to grind beans for a strong pot of coffe. No bells and whistles, just one push button to grind. No levels of grinding. Wont buy another one."
5,love this,"I love this product and use it almost every day. It is perfect sized, easy to use, and easy to clean."
1,Terrible!!!,"I have had several grinders and this is by far the worst one! It did not grind the beans up very fine, it was not convenient. I made a mess everytime I used it... I would NOT tell anyone to buy this one."
3,2 year old loves it!,"My 2 year old grandson LOVES dinosaurs and Dino Dan. He really prefers the first Dino Dan DVD more than this one. There is one episode here done in a film noir style (black & white) that he hates and starts yelling, no no, when it comes on the screen. The remaining episodes are ok. My big problem with both of these DVDs is that they're very short. This entire DVD is only 60 minutes. But, if you have a child who loves dinosaurs, it's fine for only $10."
4,Review - Dino Dan DVD,"My 2.5 year old is obsessed with Dino Dan. I think the episodes are somewhat boring though especially the B&W; one (which he doesn't like and like another poster said, he starts screaming ""no, no, no"" when it comes on!!Overall, a great buy - especially when your little one wants to watch an hour worth of Dino Dan!"
1,Awful Track Alert,"DO listen to track 20 before you buy. There's an earnest fellow shouting the story of bethlehem with a background of presumably-medieval singing. Please understand; he is *not* singing. He is *speaking* in a very loud voice in English. With a good deal of reverb. It sounds like something that might occur at a beloved children's christmas celebration somewhere, where the kids *really* love the show. ... Of course they don't actually; at least, *I* wouldn't've; I'd've been cringing in ashamed embarrassment. ... The CD is just annoying, and I can turn it off, and pass it on to some innocent victim....I note that there is *no hint* of this shouting fellow on the CD program; it just says ""stella nuova"" which I'm sure is what he's shouting about (it's in reverberated English)....The rest of the music is not that bad -- a little too much reverb perhaps -- but track 20 is really awful. You are warned...."
5,Excellent review for exam,This book gives the question and the explanation of the answer. It was an invaluable resourse for the exam. It worked for me.
4,Certification Review for Perianesthesia Nursing,"So far, this book is a pretty good review. Seems like most of the questions are set up like the board questions, where 2-3 answers are right, and you need to figure out what ASPAN thinks you should do first. The annotated answers are vague at times, and you need to do further research to get a straight answer. Overall, I would recommend this book. Good luck on the test!"
5,Super review guide!,"This was a GREAT review book for CPAN! Because it has two answer keys for each segment, you can check your answers only, or learn from the rationales. I was able to spend more time on the areas I was weak in, and rationales were all well explained."
3,wish it were bundled with a Kindle version,"I bought this a few weeks ago, and just got a Kindle as a gift. I hoped I could get a free or discounted Kindle version to study on the go, but it would be at the full price.There is an Amazon Upgrade program that allows purchase of a digital version, to read on line, not on Kindle, but the books I bought aren't in the program.Aside from the technical issues, I have noticed the book is wierdly organized; I've been randomly looking at questions, then looking for the answer to check myself. The answer is beyond where I expect to find it.I plan to take the exam in May; will update my review after that."
2,"Very complext, without any explanation for why","Don't get me wrong, it is good by all means. But one finds themselves feeling that there is always something they missed in an earlier page or chapter. But upon reviewing you find that you understood everything, there was just no real explanation. A bunch of crazy terms and names with no prelude, just thrown out left to our imagination, but with concrete meanings in the book. Even the action sequences and description of scenery leave you begging for a little more info so you can create a beter picture in your mind. But I guess you can say it all makes sense in the end. I guess."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Swanwick has written an intriguing biological themed cyberpunk tract.The Earth AI that has evolved is very creepy, far more so than the onein the Forever War. As, of course, is personality role-programming.However, The Compris does provide an interesting conversation at theend with the protagonist's team, who are its declared enemies. You alsodon't want vacuum flowers in your garden, that is for sure."
1,Disappointed,"I have many guided imagery/meditation audios and this one has a serious flaw: the background ""noise"" on track one is not enhancing...it is irritating, particularly if you listen through ear buds or phones. It needs to be re-mastered. Track Two is o.k."
5,Grateful Listener,"This work delivers true to its stated intent,and has become a staple in our household for soothing away life's typical, and not so typical stresses. Since I was diagnosed with a ""terminal illness"" I have been seeking a diversion of substance, and was referred to Kalamalka Colours. I feel that Shannon Lavell has truly connected with the soul in spiritual tumult,(as mine in this trying time)and has empowered us to follow our own ""compass within"". Thank you so much Shannon."
2,Used product,"This product was obviously used. It has scrap marks and other things showing screws have been used on this. I've very disappointed there is such a poor selection of this type product because I'm stuck with this one. I could understand selling these used IF they are listed as used and the condition was listed. These are not ""like new"" at all. If it doesn't bother you that a company is lying about this and these outlets have marks on them, then this product will probably work.When I wire this in the summer, I'll update this. I am hoping there are no shorts in the outlet and it works well. Shorting 12v batteries isn't a good thing. I'll have to test for shorts before I actually wire it, probably."
2,Items were used,"I bought 2 of these and both looked used, one more so than the other. Lots of tool marks on the face made by someone that let the screw driver slip off the screw while trying to install it."
5,The Smell of Paradise,"I just bought this cologne this afternoon. For the past few years, I've been using Eternity and Tommy Hilfiger...although extremely awesome fragrances, I decided to try a new and different one. As soon as I smelled this particular cologne, I knew this was the one I wanted to use. Not only does it smell like paradise; it smells like...victory!!!"
1,i am not satisfy,"my boyfriend has been using the eau de toilette for years and now he puts it on and minutes later the smell is gone. it seems to be a fake one.I have waited a week or so after he used it , because it was a christmas present but now not only me who thinks so, he by himself made the remark."
2,"It's Ralph, what can I say?","I would not really say I like this product. It was a gift to me some years ago and I have used it for work only. Usually just one or two quick spray and I am out the door. Now that I have discovered other brands as well as fragrances, I have to say that I would not buy this particular product again.Maybe ole' Ralphie has other fragrances that I might like but till then, I will pass. If you want to try before you buy, just try it at the mall a few times or buy a sample bottle and see if you like it. This one really does gets old fast."
5,Great fragrance!,"Persistent, strong and fresh...this is exactly what you should be wearing on a summer day!"
1,Different Seller's Name and Different Product Feature,"Seller's name is ""Odeur Bonne"" or ""Amazon.com?""Even if Amazon.com is real seller, can I believe?This product is ""RAFFINEE"" or ""POLO BLUE?""Product Feature is about ""RAFFINEE"",BUT Product Description is about ""POLO BLUE.""Which one is correct?"
5,BOOM!,"Love the smell, dont want anything else. I am always told by ladies that the smell warms their engines, their lady engines. shipped fast, big bottle."
1,Be careful before you make this deal...!!!,"For the last 3 years I am using the Polo Blue by Ralph Lauren for Men. Usually I buy this product from the nearby stores for about 40 bugs for a 2.5OZ. But when I saw the deal for 4.2OZ for about $45 in Amazon, I went ahead and purchased this one. ""Fragrance villa"" was the seller for this product in Amazon. But when I received my order I was really shocked. This product does not even have the same quality and fragrance. I know this product very well since I am using the same for last three years. But this time I can really tell you guys that I lost my time & money. This offer is never going to benefit you guys in terms of quality.So please be careful before you place order for this product...."
1,Polo Blue Toilette Spray or just Toilet Water?,I usually buy this cologne at a high end department store. But thought I would save a few bucks and was very disappointed. I dont't know if this was a knock off or just very old stock but it smelled slightly different. Additionally it was weak and did not last nearly as long as others I have purchased. I also had to use twice as much to get the same results. I have been using this scent for years and have never had this issue before when purchasing from name brand stores. Would not purchase again. Will go back to other sources.
1,not the real stuff,"I'VE purchase polo blue from macy's for about 4 YEARS NOW,,,,I LOVE POLO BLUE,,,WHEN I SAW IT ON AMAZON,,I FIGURE HEY POLO BLUE, GOOD PRICE FOR THE COLONGE SO I PURCHASED IT,,,WOW DID I GET RIPPED OFF,,,ITS NOT THE REAL COLONGE,,I WILL NEVER BYE COLONGE ON LINE AGAIN,,IL TAKE A DRIVE TO MACY'S AND BUY IT...I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,,LEARNED MY LESSON,,,"
2,Polo Blue Review,"The product came promptly in appropriate packaging. The product, however, seemed to be much ""weaker"" than many previous purchases. It required a larger application and certainly did not last as long as the other products I used. Although the product may have been ""normal strength"" I will not purchase again from this supplier."
2,It doesn't seem to be authentic,I am disappointed in this purchase. It appears to be some kind on knock off product that does not smell the same as the Polo Blue I already had at home. The authentic product has a long lasting scent whereas the scent from this purchase not only smells different but does not last very long either.
2,Is it Real?,"So I've bought Polo Blue now for a few years... but...this apparently is not the REAL thing. It seems to have some of the qualities of the stuff I got years ago (smells the same) and maybe it is - but - it doesn't have the ""pizz-azz"" the old bottles had. It doesn't seem to have that day-long effect of the older bottles I have. It may be that ol' Ralph has changed the formula. It may be that I'm getting older. Or it may be that it ain't the real thing.I'm just sayin'. It could be just me. After all, all colognes are pretty much subjective..."
5,Heavenly!,"I bought this for my 20 year old son for Christmas and he loved it. It smells great! Its not too strong like some mens cologne, its light and fine for day or evening."
1,Women hate the smell!,"This is my first and last bottle of Polo cologne. Not matter what, women around the world just don't like the synthetic smell. It gives my daughter and wife headaches and they want to puke when they smell it. Never again."
1,Bad Cologne,"This cologne is overrated, if your looking for a unique smell and something that will actually stand out avoid this cologne. To add to that it does not even smell good."
1,One of the worst purchases ever!!!,"The fragrance is so weak that my husband was pouring the cologne on and the scent was still too faint to notice. I sucked it up and purchased another bottle, elsewhere, at full price and what a world of difference!"
3,The mafia takes on the terrorists in dated novel.,"In Warren Adler's ""We Are Holding the President Hostage"", we see things are they were in the mid-80s: geopolitical games with the Soviet Union, the decline of the Mafioso, Lebanon a hotspot for terrorism(hostage taking). In Egypt, a terrorist trys to take a high ranking American official hostage, but the plan is botched and he kidnaps a bystanding American mother and her young child. Little did any know the chain of events that would set off, for the terrorist has the only daughter and grandchild of a powerful Don, who will stop at nothing to have her returned safely. The Don recruits a few loyal men to effect a bold plan: take the President hostage, and force him to go to the mattresses against the terrorists. Some interesting geopolitical manuevering is done, and very good climax. The cliches bring down the novel though, but it was interesting to see the Soviets save the day here."
2,A worm that should be trodden on.,Oh dear the ravages of time have rendered this worm very weak. I saw it as Witchfinder General in the UK years ago and the audience cheered when the revenge hit the floor. But now it looks very much a Hammer Horror B movie. Endles shots of horses galloping. Very nice if your an equestrian but it does not further the plot. Lovely scenery and Cromwellian housing does not make a good film. Based on fact they say. Well this is one film that should go the way of the witches. It has appalling acting with women making feeble tears and cries. And some of the wigs are gloriously illfitting and clearly made of straw. Perhaps they are Cromwellian. Burn burn burn.
1,Fast forward review,"Sex sleaze fans expect certain things from a witch hunter movie; nubile females (and their mannequins) getting too much infrared radiation and the standard torture scenes, complete with the priest dude holding the feather pen screaming for confessions. What you don't expect is the Vince, who somehow got talked into this sleaze flick.With Vince's participation you might expect a PG treatment here, but actually there are three bare barmaid bosom (triple B) scenes. But that's about it, aside from the standard fully-clothed burning scene, which is done pretty well.So, one star for the one village gathering and bonfire, but that's it. Zero rack scenes, the whips are put away, one bare-back needle scene, similar to ""Mark of the Witch"" except the guy with the needle isn't as ugly."
2,A Blu-ray that doesn't play like one.....,"I was REALLY thrilled to see that a BLU-RAY exists of one my favorite Vincent Price films , WITCHFINDER GENERAL ! But what was not thrilling is that this particular one , in A , B & C Region , will NOT PLAY the extra features on my player ! Yet it plays the MOVIE excellent , but will not allow my player to access all the special features ! WHAT A RIP-OFF and HOW DARE AMAZON.COM , with all their silly rules and regulations pertaining to sellers , allow THIS ONE to be swept under the rug ! SHAME ON AMAZON.COM .I would return it to the seller , but at least I can watch the movie and it's just not worth MY TIME , MONEY & TROUBLE .Now , how many of you "" REGION A ,B or C "" buyers had the same trouble I did ?"
1,"I would have a nice review for this, but...","I ordered this product from a Marketplace seller called DVD Legacy. They seemed reputable enough. However, after placing my order I expected to receive my dvd within two weeks, seeing as they say they're from NY (actually Jersey)and I'm in MI. At the end of the second week I finally did receive a package from them...only it wasn't the Witchfinder General I had ordered. No, what I got was a very special episode of Goosebumps, not to mention the disc was loose in the case. This is UNACCEPTABLE DVD Legacy! So I spent the next three days trying to get some sort of return code, they require you to have before you send anything back. It was only after contacting Amazon, that I finally got a reply...terrible. So I got their little code and sent the dvd back, all at my expense...THANK YOU, DVD Legacy! Anyways, we'll see how long it takes for me to get my refund. Don't you hate when this happens. Me too, that's why I'm never ordering from them again."
1,RIVAL 5 QUART WOODEN ICE CREAM MAKER,"DO NOT GET THIS MACHINE. I TOO HAD METAL SHAVINGS IN THE ICE CREAM FROM THE METAL SHAFT ON THE PADDLE. THE METAL BAR ON THE PADDLE DOESN'T ""SEAT"" WELL AND GETS STRIPPED AND GRINDS THE METAL BAR AND SHAVINGS FALL INTO THE ICE CREAM. POOR POOR DESIGN."
3,I recommend something else.,High-torque motor gets tired and shuts off long before ice cream is frozen. Pine bucket looks great. Wimpy plastic dasher breaks easily- we had 2 break and cannot find a replacement. Go buy some Blue Bell.
2,MIlk Shake,NOt ice cream...you get a milk shake after 40 -45 minutes. Fortunately I have a plastic paddle out of a 40 year old ice cream maker that is much more sturdy than the one that came with the new freezer.
1,Terrible,It is better to buy an inexpensive one because when the ice melts it leaks through the wood and I have to keep going back to put ice in the bucket because the space is so small. I have one that I bought for $16 and all I have to do is put the ice in one time and wait until it is done. It is not worth getting.
2,Stirring part broke on first use,"I used crushed ice, but the ice seemd to clog the motion during the first use. The main plastic stir part broke on first use. I keep searching the internet for the part. Like previous reviews, the bottom froze, but the top was very liquid. After re-freezing, the end result was quite good. The Cookies & Creme recipe was easy for my 12 yr old son to make. As of now, this is expensive for a one-time use. I can't understand why the most important part was plastic"
1,Pourly Made,I have used this ice cream maker 4 times and on the 4th time themetal pin that turns the paddle broke. I find that the metal pin onlygoes into the plastic paddle about 3 inches. The ice cream froze on thesides of the bucket and the plastic paddle couldn't turn the frozencream causing the paddle to crumble. I would not recommend this to anyone as it is cheaply made.
1,Leaky bucket,The bucket leaks regardless of soaking it in water. I soaked the bucket for 24 hours and the ice water drains right out. Because of the leaking it takes much longer to freeze the ice cream and it makes a much bigger mess than needed. I would never buy this ice cream maker again. I am looking for a plastic bucket model.
2,works but,The design of this ice cream maker leaves a lot to be desired. Only small cracked or shaved ice will fit around the tub and the plastic lid is already showing signs of wear.
1,DO NOT BUY!!! FAULTY PRODUCT!!! Broke 3 in a row!!!,"Do not buy this ice cream maker. I bought one thinking that it was a quality old fashioned ice cream maker like grandma's old one that lasted 20 years. BUT IT IS NOT!!! It did not freeze after an hour, and when we took it apart, it had shredded the metal shaft, and put metal shavings in the ice cream. We returned it for a new one, and it did the same thing. We returned it again, and gave it a third chance, but it shaved the rod a third time. DO NOT BUY RIVAL ICE CREAM MAKERS!!! They need to recall all of their faulty products."
1,AWFUL ITEM,This is is not worth getting. It worked great the first two times. Then the bucket started leaking water. Had to reseal all of the joints. The bracket on the bottom of the motor broke that turns the ice cream bucket. Save your money and buy from a store near you so you can return if needed.
1,Piece of junk,This is a piece of junk!!!! The beater inside broke while making the first batch of ice cream and the ice cream hadn't even frozen totally.
2,beware of metal filings in ice cream,"BEWARE !! If you do not install the electric crank/motor properly, the paddle shaft will strip out the metal insert of the motor housing causing metal shavings/filings to contaminate the product. The first time we used the maker, we were able to place the electric crank/motor on top of the can with the lid engaged...or so we thought. We were able to ""lock"" down the motor and the maker was able to turn the can / paddle. Everything seemed hunky dory until we opened the can to check on the progress to find the top covered with metal shavings. After further inspection, we noticed that the shaft of the paddle was striping out the metal gear of the motor. It is very disappointing to have to throw away 5 qts of homemade ice cream...not to mention the cost of ingredients. We have since been able to produce ice cream while making sure the motor is properly seated upon the can lid. However, we will be looking for a better machine."
3,ival 8550-X 5-Quart Wooden Electric Ice Cream Maker,"the item i ordered was a gift. so i didn't take it out of the box, instead wrapping it. i was a disappointed that the box the item arrived in was dented, torn and scratched. it was a wedding gift and am a little embarassed it was presented in such a condition."
4,Rival 8550-X Electric Ice Cream Maker,"This product does an excellent job of making home made ice cream provided you use a recipe that will freeze up well. We tend to put more of the cream products in (whipping and half & half) to give it more body, so it takes longer for it to freeze. But, with liberal use of salt prior to the actual ""cranking"", it will freeze up quite nicely. Good product!"
2,Does a poor job,"Used this ice cream maker twice, following the directions. It froze the cream hard on the outside but left the interior portion of the cream still liquid, even after more than 1 hour of running. With the outside portion of cream frozen hard, paddle was frozen with it. Instruction book says it should only take 40 minutes.I would not recommend this."
2,Good when it worked but cheaply made!,"I used this twice. It is easy to use and makes good ice cream but is cheaply made. On the second use, the dasher broke.(that's the part that mixes the ice cream) I contactd Rival and they told me that that part isn't available as a replacement part. I'm not sure why it isn't because they are still selling this model. I have looked everywhere on the internet I can think of and can't find the dasher for sale. I am now stuck with an ice cream maker that won't mix the ice cream! I am very disappointed in this product."
1,poor product,"I have to agree with a number of other reviewers here. The wooden bucket leaks. The only way I could make ice cream at all was to put the whole thing in my kitchen sink & fill the sink with water. That way the brine had nowhere to leak to. The paddle shaft/motor interface is terrible. It started to strip the first time I used it. Yes, I had aluminum shavings in the ice cream, too. With very careful assembly, I was able to use it 3 more times--then I grew frustrated & threw it out. Your money is better spent on a quality ice cream maker."
1,Frustrating machine,"After roughly 10 bouts with this ice cream maker, I tossed it in the trash this past weekend. The primary issue is the poor quality of the plastics in the join between the motor and the lid on the canister. After the very first use, the plastic on both began to grind down creating poor contact. By the fourth use, it was essentially useless."
2,Worked well for the first few batches,"I was so pissed at this maker the other day, I visualized myself kicking it down my front yard! I've made ice cream for several years and have tried several makers. This one was reasonably priced and a brand that I was familiar with. It worked fine for the first few batches but the last two times, it's been terrible. The last batch that I made (I thought was frozen well), then I opened the canister and it was not. I finished it up in my Cuisinart freezerCuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice-Cream Maker, White(which works wonderfully but it just makes 1.5 quarts per batch). I purchased two of these and they both have problems, so it doesn't seem to just be an occasional flaw. Don't buy it!"
5,"Warns against overuse of ""canned"" or pre-prepared approaches","No More Darn Buzzwords: Keys To Successful Organized Change by David Chaudron (a Managing Partner of Organized Change Consultancy) is a quite practical and accessible instructional and informational guide for business and organizational planning that warns against overuse of ""canned"" or pre-prepared approaches and buzzwords, so frequently used by corporate managers when attempting to squeeze their unique structure into a mass-produced stratagem that may not be effectively tailored for their own needs. Individual chapters succinctly address how to develop and implement plans that are geared specifically to what one's individual business requires, successful assessment and measurement, facilitating teamwork, improving training methods, and much, much more. No More Darn Buzzwords is strongly recommended as being an excellent and advantageous resource."
2,Addressed to wives of alcoholic husbands,"The title is dishonest and the book content is sexist. The book is written as though all wives are sober and only husbands are drunks (at least, every page I looked at, because of that problem I did not buy the book). The subtitle should say ""A guide for women who live with an alcoholic husband"" (rather than what it does say, ""A guide for those who live with an alcoholic""). I had hopes of finding a good book for a male friend dealing with his destructively drunk wife. So far each book I have found whose title sounds promising ends up being addressed to the woman dealing with a drunk husband.For women dealing with alcoholic men, what I paged through looked decent, but the book will be a real misfire for those who bought it on the title alone."
1,Not an espresso maker ...,"While I'm sure this coffee machine can make OK ""strong coffee"", it is not an espresso machine. Water is forced through ground coffee using steam pressure (little over 1 bar of pressure), same principle as those italian stovetop coffee makers. It is well known that 8 to 10 bars af pressure are necessary for full extraction of the coffee oils that make espresso. You'll need a machine with a pump if your intention is to make true espresso. I'd get the italian stovetop coffee maker instead of this one : works better, easier to clean and will last forever. I suggest the one made out of steel, not aluminum. ciao."
5,A Bargain,"I hesitated to buy this when I looked at the price - at less than half the price of the next one, somethong must have been wrong with it. It turned out to be a bargain, though. My daily latte fix was becoming a major expense, and I couldn't afford not to take advantage of this. Makes a great latte, as good as any espresso bar."
1,Bad product,"After 2 uses, the milk steamer pipe does not work. I cleaned it properly and did not misuse it. Now I can make the espresso, but I can't steam the milk to make a cappucino. It's useless."
1,don't buy if you want it for more than 6 months,"This little machine worked very nicely for the first 6 months of it's life-- then it simply quit. It won't brew the coffee and takes 20 minutes to squeak out 2 tablespoons of liquid- the rest dissipating into steam. Of course I tried the recommended &quot;descaling&quot; technique listed in the product brochure- but it did nothing.I called the melitta/salton customer service for some kind of help, but since I had long tossed my receipt, they were absolutely apathetic to the fact that their product is defective. I would never recommend buying this product because it will only break after a few months of normal use. Spend the money on your favorite coffee house instead!"
1,Returned right away,"After opening the box I returned without even trying it, it was the cheapest thing I've ever seen. I'd be embarassed to have it sitting on my counter."
1,Dont waste your money on this imatation espresso machine,"I have this machine (received as a gift) and it is just a lousy espresso machine. The steamer takes about5 min to warm the milk for Latte's. And by the time the milk has reached the temperature, there is hardly any water left in the machine to make the espresso. Per the instructions, you are not allowed to ""pack"" the espresso cup with coffee grounds... I found out why when I placed a little too much coffee into the holder,, and when the machine was about half way finished, steam spewed out of the top of holder... in other words,, the seal isnt very tight. if you are going to buy an espresso machine,, spend extra money,, you get what you pay for."
5,Simple Elegance,"I make two or three lattes a day with the Melitta MEX1B I got at Target. Using just a cup as a frothing pitcher, I fill it half way. Next I froth it with steam WITHOUT the frothing gizmo. I pour the coffee through the foam and get an amazing latte. The coffe making parts wash easily and in five minutes its all clean and waiting to make another great cup of coffe."
2,"Sorry, usable, but no Cigar...","Reviewer ""Duilawyer"" was correct. This machine makes great Froth although it does not make Expresso. It is probably not possible for a machine of this type to actually make great expresso. You need the power of a pump machine to extract all the flavor and ""Crema"" from either French Roast or Itallian roast expresso beans. The fact that the instructions tell you not to pack the coffee tightly into the strainer should give a clue the machine does not have the power to make expresso. I had no problems with the operation of the machine and it does make good hot chocolate, Cafe Au laits, Lattes,good coffee, but it will simply not make expresso required drinks. Amateurs only need apply."
5,A GREAT Little machine,"Just want you all to know that I've had this machine for over 10 years, and this has been the greatest espresso machine without many problems. Only problem I ever had with it was that you have to tighten the lid from time to time with a Phillips screwdriver. Other than that, I think whomever purchases it will be happy."
4,good coffee,"I got this about 3 years ago from a friend who was moving and didn't want to take it with her. I don't use it every day, and have only used the frother a couple of times (I would rather not have to clean it then have frothy milk). I love how fast it is, and it's not super loud.My only problem with it is my lattes have been tasting bitter recently. Looking around online (I didn't get a manual since it was used) it seems I should have been taking apart the part where the water comes out and cleaning that as well. I took it apart and found that it smelled of old coffee (ew) so I soaked it all in vinegar. Now the metal parts smell good, but the gasket still stinks! I have no idea how to clean it or where to get a new one. :( But I am happy that this has been my only issue with it."
3,great machine but a couple of quirks,"This machine has fantastic power in terms of foaming the milk. However, the rubber tip from the foamer keeps falling into the cup. Because the frothing unit is too low. If you can live with this, it is still a great machine for the money."
1,works for 2 months,"My espresso/cappuccino maker worked great for 2 months or so, until the steam would no longer come out of the proper spot. I can no longer use it to make cappuccinos."
3,Hmmm . . .,"When I found a can of Melitta espresso at the local supermarket I decided to get it (locally at a scary discount), since I have needed a caffeine machine to save trips to Starbucks for espresso.The burned electical wiring smell got into my nose, my kitchen and my clothes, so I gave it several runs with water and then coffee before drinking. It might be better with Starbucks' grind, the Melitta Traditional has been a little too bitter for me, but I had 4 demi's of it so it's not undrinkable.Easy to use - I measure the water with my demitasse filled to the rim, and pull it away just as the brew ends and the air comes out so as not to blast the bit of crema it produces. I use a 3/4"" thick piece of wood to elevate the demitasse and saucer to avoid spatter from the portafilter. I will use it until I get a true espresso machine. Can you spell Sylvia? $$$$$$! Haven't tried any frothing yet, but it should work for that. It was not a waste of $, and Starbucks is still around too."
1,Three brews,That's what I got out of this machine before the frother stopped working. You get what you pay for.
1,very unreliable,"this is the same coffee maker as the MAXIM, but uses a different name. man, this is the worst. they have sent me 4 new ones over the past couple of years becuase the first machines all broke for one reason or another. and, one of them, i swear to god, even caught fire when it was brewing!!!!i highly recommend spending a few more bucks and getting something better."
5,Awesome little espresso machine!!,"I just woke up this morning to use my new Malitta espresso machine and found that I had lost the instructions. I gave it a try anyway and ended up whipping up a couple of awesome cappuccinos first try!! I bought a bag of Starbuck beans & ground them up and used this espresso machine to brew it. The milk frother really works good too. Not too shabby indeed. I recommend this to anyone, especially considering the low cost."
4,Melitta,"This product is great. The only thing that I don't like about it is that if you want to make a second ""batch"" you have to wait a while for espresso maker to cool down. If you do not, when you pour water into it, it steams and spits all over."
4,"loved it, but it clogged, here's a fix","Coffee started to only dribble out, not as usual, so I flipped it over and unscrewed the strainer in the top, took it out and cleaned out what appeared to be hard water deposits (we live in a very hard water area), (also ran vinegar through for good measure) then it worked again great! I have to say that I agree with the previous reviewer, this machine did pay for itself, even if I did have to fix it..."
1,Appalling! You get what you pay for...,"I am not a snob or a spendthrift, but I have learned my lesson. This baby was $30 at target, so I thought why not? Bad move. I used it three times:the first time I ran water through it (as directed to clean it. it worked fine.then i ran water through again (as above). The water shot out more forcefully and caused a spill, but still okay.Then I ran it the third time, with espresso in the filter, to make my first pot: steam oozed out of the cracks around thew (properly sealed) lid, then it oozed out of every crevice. The machine looked like it would explode, and the resulting coffee tasted like burnt plastic.I returned that thing and vowed never again.You'd think I'd have learned after my previous puchase of a $7 drip coffee maker, but no. It took two machines that produced spills and plasticky tasting brew, before I learned my lesson: buy quality."
2,Was Great While It Lasted,"I got my machine and made espresso saturday afternoon and sunday morning. they were good, too. better than starbucks, if i say so myself. then i steamed some milk sunday afternoon and never could get the machine to make espresso again. i even let the machine sit for a day and tried to make only espresso the next evening. it didn't work. i am so very disappointed. but life goes on."
3,Good espresso - bad build quality,"I had this for 2 weeks before the ""pressure relief valve"" broke. Once that happenned it leaked steam all the time and no longer brewed properly. When it worked the coffee was very good. I suppose with a more expensive machine you would get a metal pressure valve that wouldn't break."
4,Great little machine!,"I had been looking for an inexpensive espresso/cap machine since living in Italy a few years ago. I didn't want to pay the big bucks they want fo a ""good"" one. My wife and I found this one with the 20 piece set and thought ""What the heck"". Let me tell you, the first try at cappucino was a flash back to Italy! I love this little machine and would recommend it to anyone."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought the machine as a present for a friend of mine and after the first day out of the box there was a problem. We returned it to melitta and they replaced it. Within a couple of weeks it broke again. Again we returned it and Melitta sent a new one. After about 2 months the machine broke a third time and again we sent it back. They have been great about replacing them when they break. There is a one year warranty on the machine and they pay for all the shipping costs but if I were to do it again, I would just pay the extra money for a machine that didn't break every couple of months."
4,nice item,"i bought this item for my mother's birthday. it worked great!!!i'm so impressed with this little thing! i would like to have seen the instructional video on dvd rather then vhs, as we don't have a vcr."
1,Broke in 2 months,"I drink 1 espresso each morning. After about 60 days of use the machine began spattering and sputtering, producing 75% steam and very little, poor tasting mud. Finally yesterday (61 days out) it quit producing coffee all together - it only produces steam now.... my advice -spend the extra 30$ and buy a braun that will last...."
2,Disposable Espresso Machine,"This machine worked well for about three weeks then began leaking steam. Presently it barely even makes the full amount of espresso. I certainly did not expect a 30 dollar espresso machine to last and take the place of Starbucks in my life, but it was an attempt to save a bit of money. We have cleaned it and cajoled it, but we're taking it back and buying another."
1,Worst musical ever,"I am a huge Queen fan and a big fan of musical theatre but I hated the musical. I think it's the worst musical to ever hit the stage. I can't understand why the Queen music rights holders allowed to use this amazing music in this awful staging wiith stupid plot full of stupid jokes. I don't recommend buying the CD or going to the theatre to see the show. If you want to listen to Queen, buy their original recordings. Buying this CD would be a waste of money."
5,You don't have to be a Queen fan to love this,"What a fantastic show - I saw it twice in the same day. The second time I took my wife who had originally refused to go because she doesn't like rock or Queen. She is a big musical theatre fan and I convinced her the humor, staging and performances would make it worth while. I now can't get the CD away from her. Hannah Jane Fox is incredible, although we prefer the current lead, Mig Ayesa. The show really proves how the strength of the harmonies in Queen's music make it something to be enjoyed by everyone for years to come."
1,Another half-assed phamphlet from Chas Balun,"At a whopping 64 pages, Balun's publishing house had some big cajones asking people to pony up 10 bucks for this pamphlet. Too bad, as Balun is not without (some) talent as a writer, and has some witty remarks. What sinks this is that it (like his similarly slim bio on Lucio Fulci)was written so quickly and half-assedly that it holds no value. Add to that this was written by Balun in the early nineties and is now hideously out of date. SKIP THIS ONE!"
2,DOA,"Installed card into my Windows 7 system, booted up and...nothing. Nothing appeared in device manager, no signs of life when plugging in a firewire camera. I powered down and tried plugging into a 2nd PCI port and got the same result. The ""QC Passed"" sticker on the board is mocking me. I'll give 2 stars instead of 1 because it's always possible there was ESD damage in the brief time between the bag and the board, even though I was pretty careful."
1,Glass and Rocks?,"This is the first time that I've ever found real rocks in my rock salt.I take my ice cream ball to a friend's house so that our kids can play, and then we can have ice cream. All goes well until I dump the salty water into her beautiful sink, and then I spend the next ten minutes apologizing and scraping little rocks and what looks suspiciously like bits of glass out of her garbage disposal.The salt part all dissolved right on cue, but that stuff was certainly not all salt. I couldn't believe that I was right, but when I got home I checked and double checked the bag--yep, little rocks. Maybe I got a bad bag? Maybe it's supposed to be rocks and salt instead of rock salt? All I know is I'll be picking a different brand next time I make ice cream."
1,never used,"Well i ordered this for my ice cream machine, but exchanged it for a machine that doesn't use ice and salt rocks.. Return for this wasn't as easy as my ice cream maker sooo its just sitting in its box on my floor"
3,Depends how you use it.,"This product is very effective for melting ice (although potassium chloride is more effective still) on driveways and sidewalks. It is, however, singularly ineffective as a vehicle for expressing political disapproval. And anyone who does so should seriously consider growing up and getting a day job."
3,Not very entertaining,"I was looking for Urban Legend books for use in my classroom. I found many written by Brunvand at a good price, so I bought the lot without previewing his work. This was a mistake on my part because his books are very academic. I was looking for stories to inspire creative writing, but these are more informational than entertaining. I was disappointed, but at the same time I recognize the value of the book. The author goes through many stories, categorically, and debunks the myths. He generally gives short versions of common stories. It was educational, but not in the way I was hoping."
2,It wasn't very good! :(,"I thought it was the stories, but no, it's just the proof the author has that the legends are true or false. From the other reviews I've heard, I thought it was going to be a really good book, but it wasn't. I was very disappointed, and I don't recommend for you to waste your money on this book."
3,Okay book but...........,"I just bought this book the other day after seeing the movie ""Urban Legends."" I thought it (the book) would be scarier than it was. It really wasn't the book that I had intended on buying, but it was the only book left about the subject. I gave this book 3 stars because it was pretty good, but again, it wasn't scary enough and I think the author, Jan Harold Brunvand, used to much first person. I still intend on buying ""The Big Book of Urban Legends"" by this author and would appreciate any e-mails concerning how this (the book I just mentioned) is and if it's any better than the one I've already read. Buy it if you're desperate, but don't if you're not!!"
3,"Very cute, but misleading description","I love this quilt, in theory. I would have given it 5 stars if the description was accurate. However, this quilt is not 100% cotton, which is what the listing says. The back (the black and white striped side) is polyester. I really wanted a 100% cotton quilt and I ordered two of these for my toddler. He now sleeps with the polyester side against him, which I don't love, but is okay in the meantime until I find a quilt that is actually 100% cotton."
1,Junk,"This item fell apart the first time I used it. The casing on the end that goes into the iPhone came off and the wire inside broke off the contact. It is junk, don't buy it."
1,DO NOT ORDER,"This product is terrible and does NOT work. I can not get it to charge my phone when plugged into the wall through an adapter or through my computer's USB port. My computer tells me that it does not recognize the USB device. No wonder it was so cheap, I should have known better!"
1,the USB cable sucks,"The cable slowed down my computer and my iPod whenever I tried to sync it with my iTunes, and plus, it snapped in two in about a week."
1,Worthless,"The cable did not work, so I had to go to Best Buy and purchase their name brand- luckily that one worked. This was a waste of money."
4,Serves Its Purpose,I was amazed at the value of the item for the money. Serves its purpose well as I keep it in my car for a quick attachment to my Ipod.
1,Fire!,"Bought this to use on a road trip with a 6 year-old. I loaded several of his favorite shows on an I-Touch and plugged in this cable. About an hour into the trip I heard him scream that the cord was getting hot and pulled over to see what was going on. Sure enough, the cord shorted itself and ""smoked"". I was so mad I through it away. Wish I would have saved it to post a picture of here. Buyer beware."
2,Stopped working in less than a month,Worked great for the first couple of weeks now won't work at all. It will connect briefly but then disconnects.
1,Faulty Cable,"The iPod cable that I purchased from this seller worked for less than a day and the wires disconnected from the portion that connects to the iPod.Although it was only a dollar, I still lost time while waiting for the cable and then after it has broken.Review: 0.5/100"
4,customer service,Well I must say that customer service is a great help I was not satisfied with my order but customer service got right back with me and fixed my problem and for that I am very satisfied.
5,Excellent Value & Quality,I received the 2 USB charging cables ordered earlier than I thought. They were exactly what I expected and worked! Great deal.
3,Basic Iphone Sync Cable,"Works ok, sometimes it seems to have shortages. Definitely would reccomend though. The cord is made from decent quality. But then again it's just for something as simple as a sync cable."
5,One of my favorite small appliances,"My George Foreman grill has an honored spot on my countertop. I use it several times a week for panini, quesadillas, grilling tofu; the list goes on and on. It takes up very little space, but still has room to fit 2 sandwiches. It heats up fast, so I can make lunch quickly and get right back to work."
1,ABC news classics royal wedding: Prince Charles and Lady Diana,This product was aweful. I was very disapointed. I was looking for a DVD of the complete royal wedding and this not it. If there is such a DVD of the full wedding I would very much interested in getting it.
1,ABC Royal Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana,"I expected to get the entire Wedding on DVD.it was 45 minutes long. The Commentators talked over almost the entire Wedding excerps and activities! Grainy quality. I gave this 1 star, only because there was nothing lower! Don't buy!!!!!"
2,Poor Quality US Product,Not very good quality. Music does not really fit wedding... Just a US compliation of the wedding..Much less than what I remember and hoped for... The only good copy would be done by the BBC.I do not recommend this product.
3,WEDDING OF CHARLES & DIANA,I WAS NOT SO HAPPY WITH THIS DVD. NOT ENOUGH FOOTAGE OF THE WEDDING AND THE BEAUTIFUL MUSIC. TOO MUCH OF BARBARA WALTERS.
1,extremely disappointed,"I was so excited to watch this when it arrived. I loved the actual wedding back in 1981--great music, great scenes of London, a really beautiful event. This dvd chops out so much of what I was looking forward to. It just barely shows the highlights, has way too much commentary from Barbara Walters and left me feeling cheated and disappointed. It's better than having no reminder at all of the royal wedding, but I'm now off to eBay to see if anyone has the original BBC video. I'm not a complainer or hard to please, so sorry to be negative."
4,A wedding fan's review,"I stayed up all night when I was 13 to watch this wedding live on television. Recently, I began a search for coverage of the wedding as the 10th anniversary of Diana's death approached. This dvd was suggested to me and I was thrilled to find it. It does have wonderful coverage of the event and covers all the high notes. If what you are looking for is a reminder of the beauty and pagentry of this ""wedding of the century"", this dvd will be a wonderful addition to your collection. However, for a fan such as myself on whose teenage brain the wedding made such an impact, I found that some of the strategic cuts on the coverage eliminated things that I was looking forward to seeing again."
3,Don't be lured by this title - not for the faint of heart,"Don't be lured by this title - this book is not for the faint of heart. I picked up this book because I'm a beginner acoustic guitar player. This is not a fake book or a ""beginner's"" guitar book. The songs are very well transcribed and no detail is left out. One major gripe is the chord chart at the end is very basic and doesn't include half of the chords used throughout this somewhat advanced guitar book. Good book for an intermediate player but not for a beginner.....which the ""Dummies"" title often suggests."
4,"Not simple, but a good book to learn on","While the book is in no uncertain terms ""For Dummies"", the book contains enough popular acoustic songs to keep the beginning player interested, while allowing them to grow as they progress.I've used this book for about a year, in parallel with leasons from an instructor, and it has exceeded my expectations. The performance notes won't make much sense to a true beginner, but in conjuction with leasons, are extremely helpful in excelling quickly.Some criticisms, the book is mis-labeled. It is not a book for beginners learning how to play acoustic guitar from a book. Rather it is a compendium of acoustic songs & tab, period. The chord chart is incomplete for all the chords used in the book, but unfortunately, that's not uncommon. Performance notes often use terms beginners will be unfamiliar with.Still, with a wide range of very good songs, I recommend it. Just make sure you take lessons if you're looking to actually learn how to play. :)"
4,Good Value,"Excellent value for money. Great for the beginner/intermediate who has mastered some chords and wants to play first songs. a good range of styles and degrees of difficulty. Short ""playing notes"" are helpful. A CD of the music would be an extra bonus."
5,Great book,"I'm just starting to learn how to play the guitar, so everything is a struggle, but this book makes it a little easier and it is fun when you start to hear yourself playing songs that you recognize."
2,"Don't be fooled, it's not for Dummies.","Don't be fooled by the title, this is not for Dummies. If you do not have a working knowledge of sheet music, you'll need to learn. I was expecting a more ""walkthrough"" version. It comes with tabs for those who can not read sheet music but unless you have the song handy, it's difficult to pick up and play.I'm very new to the guitar and found Guitar for Dummies by Emedia (also on this site) much more helpful as it has video and audio instruction as well as animated fretboards. If you are completely unexperienced or need instruction, this is not it.The chord chart in the back also lacks any of the suspended chords called for in the songs. Don't know what a Csus2 is? You won't find it in the book.However, if you can read sheet music, you'll do fine in buying this book."
4,Alot,"This book has alot of the songs I have wanted play, with practice I should be playing them with ease."
2,Great book - except...,"While the book has some interesting insights as to the styles, history, and instructional hints, the biggest item this book lacks is no guitar chord diagrams. This is clearly a HUGE oversight, as this being an easy, dummy type book, should make it so for the average Joe reader. The letter name of the chord is listed, but you have to refer to another book to show you how to finger it. I'll probably return mine (or sell it)."
2,"This bok is really for the dummies, but it taught me things.",It taught me a few things and I've been playing guitar for about 40 years.
2,Shocked and offended,"I have not had a chance to look too much at the book yet, but the first time I opened it up I was shocked and offended. I just glanced at a page and saw profanity in the lyrics of a song. I feel that this is totally unnecessary. I have heard the song in question on the radio and no profanities were in the lyrics. I percieve this book as being for all ages and this type of language is totally uncalled for."
1,phillips tea kettle needs improvement,"We bought one of these for Christmas, I initially loved it and used it almost daily. By the end of february, it developed a leak and drained water over the electric base and the counter. Don't buy this one."
5,"Look no further, this is the one you want","I had one from Hamilton Beach. My Mom bought this one and told me to to compare them. Guess what, I returned the Hamilton Beach and kept the Philips, it was faster in boiling the water and better looking design. Also, I use the water from an Amway water filter system so I have no problem with build up or anything, it is always sparkling clean and very inviting to use. I think I will go now for a cup of tea, make that 2 cups!"
2,Good Company - Bad Product,"This item broke after about 4 days of use. A spark came from the base and then the smell of something burning. I wrote the company and they were GREAT about replacing the item. They shipped a new one out right away and I shipped the old one back. The only problem was, the new one didn't last any longer. After two or three days the kettle died. No spark or burning this time, but it wouldn't stay engaged long enough to heat. Although I love the company and think their customer service was great, I didn't bother going through a third tea kettle. I bought a different brand that I've happy with."
5,Super fast!,Love this kettle. It boils 8 cups of water in the same time it takes to nuke one! Heating plate is easy to clean. Worth the extra buck.
3,Had two in two years,"Coming from England, I was excited to find this kettle and loved the way it looked and boiled the water. It lasted just less than a year and then would not work. We got a replacement and that one lasted about the same time. I use it daily but was hoping it would last longer."
5,cordless electric kettle,"This is the perfect gift for people who are forgetful, really busy, or easily distracted. It boils water fast, then shuts off automatically. No worry about boiling dry. If you are on the phone or busy doing something else - no worry! It takes care of itself.I've purchased this and similar kettles for my mother, friends, newlyweds, and my children in the dorm."
2,It's only lasted two years,"We bought the kettle when I was pregnant with our twins and put on bed rest for 2+ months. It was the only way I could get my tea every morning! But lo and behold, less than two years later, the damn thing no longer wants to work. For some reason, the socket and jug have stopped engaging and we now need to nudge it to find the ""sweet spot"" for it to work. But even if you do make the connection, it keeps turning off before the water has boiled. Arg! Time to shop for a new (non Phillips) kettle."
1,A good Kettle if it worked,I purchased this kettle a little under a year ago and was very pleased with it while it was working. Unfortunately it didn't last very long and the connection between the kettle and the base has worn out. Now when I place the kettle on the base it requires a lot of jiggling or spinning the kettle around for the contacts to engage so it will turn on to boil the water.It was a good kettle while it lasted but it didn't last to long. My mom has a Black and Decker that is going on 5 years and she uses it at least 2-3 times a day. It is still going strong.In conclusion I would suggest you stay away from this kettle and buy one of better quality or a diffrent brand that will last longer then 1 year unless of course you don't care about durabilty.
2,Depreciates quickly,"I bought this tea kettle about six months ago and it worked great. It still does work but the performance is much less than when I first bought it. The thing is, I was better off with the stovetop version I discontinued using after I bought this one. Like I said, it still works but now the heat element at the bottom of the kettle (inside the bottom of the kettle) is deteriorating. Everyday I have to go in and scrub out the residue that builds up and crusts off. If it weren't for the mesh filter at the spout I'd be swallowing this residue. It does the job, heats my water for my tea but it's starting to look gross at the bottom of the kettle. I like the way it looks on my counter but I don't like the way it looks inside, at the bottom where it really counts. I will hold on to this item until the heat element goes out which other owners have informed me will happen."
1,Doesn't work for me!,"Although this kettle is great looking, it simply didn't work for me! As soon as I turned it on, it would immediately turn itself off. I tried everything - more water, less water, etc. Nothing worked! I hated to return this cute looking kettle - but if it doesn't work, it doesn't work!"
2,Not my cup of tea,"Like others have already mentioned, the connection to the base is a weak spot in this unit. It started losing contact after less than a year of use. Don't buy."
2,Didn't last long...,"I enjoyed my first electric kettle very much. It worked great and the fast boiling water was wonderful when desperate for a cup of coffee. By 10 months, the connection between the base and the unit has worn out. It takes a lot of jiggling to get it to go on. I am now shopping for a different model/brand!"
2,short life,worked well -- but broke in less than a year. heating element doesn't come on now. disappointed.
1,Doesn't last long,"I bought the kettle about a year ago and have been using it daily. It worked as expected initially, but the water seems to take longer and longer to boil. Yesterday, the kettle simply wouldn't work. I thought it was an &quot;okay&quot; kettle for the price. But now, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3,4 years of dutiful service,"Item purchased april 2004, item retired november 2008. 4 years of pretty much daily service is not so bad for a $34.99 purchase.It doesn't seem like Philips makes tea kettles anymore? I am wondering about what to replace it with. Perhaps the Panasonic NCEH22PC Electric Kettle ?What I liked best about the hd4651 was its high capacity (approx 10 cups). It's been hard to find anything much above 1.5 L except for a few no-name chinese products - and about which people wrote reviews describing bad taste and horrible customer service.Philips company seems be all but out of the kettle business, and now trying to push coffee pods on consumers. It's a ""razors and razorblades"" situation I guess."
3,not up to par,Very disappointed - didn't boil as fast as promised.After 5 weeks of use still has a plastic smell and taste to water - live in So. Cal and use filtered water but had no problem with previous Oster kettle - wish I had found another Oster instead.It's now making a horrendous racket when boiling - and you can hardly hear the bell when it turns off-you almost have to put your ear to the kettle to hear it.Rate this 2 & 1/2>>>update...June 2004 - time to get a new one...kettle is now malfunctioning - doesn't seem to fit the base and have to keep watch to make sure it does not turn off - more often than not have to jiggle it around so it will turn on again...still takes forever to boil and don't need an alarm clock - I had it on a timer and can hear it boiling from the bedroom...my oster is still working...
3,Mere Romance,"Suzanne Brockman disappoints in this one. It's a plain old romance, with no adventure. Some earlier books featuring Seal Team 16 and the Troubleshooters were romantic adventures, and a much better read."
2,Miscommunication,I am a big Suzanne Brockmann fan but I find poor communication as a plot device pretty tedious. This is definitely not on par with her usual work.
3,Quick Read!,"I am a fan of SB's Troublshooter series so I decided to try out a few of her earlier novels. This book took less than a day to read. It did not challenge me or require any rereading. The characters are simple and very likable. There are miscommunications and misunderstandings that are quite believable. The big conclusion is sweet and just what you would expect. I say try this book if you are looking for a quick read or something to read after finishing an emotionally or intellectually challenging book (that's why I read it). If you are a fan of SB, give this a try to see how much she has grown as an author."
2,"very simple, cardboard characters, nor worth the money","couldnt' finish it. Not worth your money, she is a very good author but this must be a very early attempt, looks like a harlequin type of book. If you want her best look out for her troubleshooter's stories which have much more backbone, plot and sensuality."
3,Quality chrome finish but could not fit flush,"I bought this to add bit of style and function for my 01 Suburban. Although the chrome finish was good, I was not able to fit the door flush to the body of the vehicle. The contour of the Suburban's panel has a slight curve, yet this piece is flat. The instructions indicated that if the piece was not flush at test fit, you could adjust it with 'the Phillips screws'. The only Phillips screws on the door were the ones that connected the latch bracket to the vehicle in place of the rubber bump stops for the stock fuel door. Even with the screws tightened all the way, the bracket stuck out just enough to leave a 1/8"" gap between the fuel door ring and the vehicle at the top and bottom position when fully assembled. I gave three stars since this is supposed to fit a lot of GM model trucks and SUV's, so it may work just fine for someone else's vehicle or expectation."
4,One of the best 70's hard rock groups,"Back in the day, I purchased both albums as imports, as u couldn't get them otherwise, and they were my favorites. I perused the various re-release versions of these 2 albums that I could find, and this one seemed the most complete. After playing, the Frampton songs in general seem to hold up best.As a side note, on the original 1st LP, ""Natural Born Bugie"" is titled ""Natural Born Woman"" and is the 4th song (instead of ""Growing Closer""). And ""79th Street Blues"" turned into ""79th and Sunset"" on the 4th album, ""Rock On."""
5,Was just as described.,Will actually get to use it in the summer. Hopefully it will be go great. We didn't order the extra string.
4,nice shoe,have been using these shoes for about a month now and totally love them. i love the saucony brand and they seem to last longer than other brands of shoes that i have purchased. they are super padded on the tongue of the shoe so i can tie them nice and tight and they don't pinch or slip. happy with them so far!
2,Nothing New,This may be a good book for novice educators but leaves a lot to be desired for those of us with a lot of educational expertise.
2,Yawn,"I'm sorry, I can't go along with the 5-star reviews. Those ""charming"" details were just too mundane for words, and the words were pretty mundane too: ""Now Mom hollered gaily, 'Wait! No opening presents till I have a clean dipe on Baby Bob!'"" ""The dolls were dressed in milky pink bonnets and candy pink pantaloons and dresses."" I mean, does that make you want to read on? It sounds like a sequel to Dick and Jane Go to School. For advanced sixth-graders."
4,a charming read,"A fine detailed portrait of girlhood in America's heartland during the Great Depression. Lots of everyday minutiae, of a time long ago in a simpler world.In these times of trouble, immersing yourself in these violence-free memories, listening to the voices of these sisters, is really calming.Well written, not at all earth-shaking & quite memorable."
4,We Really Like It!,"We love the juice it makes! Clear with no pulp and the taste is great. Since we started juicing, we feel so much better physically it's amazing! Cleanup is simple and we found that a toothbrush is perfect to clean out the superfine blade.The only downside about the Juiceman Jr. is the noise level so early in the morning. It seems pretty loud after running a few veggies/fruit through. I'm buying one for my sister today."
2,Consider other juicers,"The mesh clogs easily, causing the machine to vibrate wildly only after a few slices of beet or apple - I had to stop it because it fealt it might desintegrate. This means that for anything than a cup or so of juice it is not the appliance to use.I used it with carrots, apples, beet, cabbage, celery. For just over 3 cups of juice mixing all of the above, I had to stop and clean the mesh at least 4 times. This is not acceptable, because I prepared the fruits and the veggies more than I should have: peeled the apples, peeled the beet root, removed the apple seeds before juicing.... With my current Juiceman II that I got after returning the Jr, there is no such problem (although there are others - I'll try to write a review for it too).The motor is OK if you are not in a hurry, but you need to be gentle with it - it slows down quite a bit when juicing hard produce such as carrots..."
3,"decent juicer, but go for 2 speeds","This juicer does its job and is durable, but I would recommend that you pay a little more to get a juicer with two speeds. I bought a bag of lemons and decided to juice them for cooking. As soon as I put half a lemon into the machine, the machine spit some juice and pulp back up the insertion hole, even before I had a chance to put the plunger in. It made a mess very quickly. I think if the juicer had a slower speed, this problem would have decreased. Also, the ejected lemon pulp in the pulp bin was more wet and runny than I expected. I thought the ejected lemon pulp would be moist but not wet because the machine would suck out all the juice. Again, slower speed would have sucked out more juice out of a juicy lemon. This unit is as noisy as one of those louder hair dryers."
2,disappointing blade,"After two weeks, you'd have thought that I was juicing rocks not apples, carrots, and oranges. The blade is so dull that the motor really gets overwhelmed easily and juicing is slow going. The stainless steel blade doesn't appear to be sufficient for basic juicing operations. There is a fair amount of solid material that isn't caught by the strainer, making for ""hearty"" juices. I like them this way once I stir it up a bit, otherwise it all collects on the top for a harsh tanin taste."
4,Good Juicer for the money,"I purchased this juicer at a yard sale about 2 years ago and really like it. I wanted to try juicing, and found that in the first year I used it once or twice time a week. The juicer works well with all hard fruit and veggies and does pretty well with kale and spinach - but the Green star or more pro-juicers may be better if your doing mostly greens. The juicer does vibrate when the filter gets full. To remedy this I usually stop the juicer and clean the filter, just wipe it quickly to remove any built up pulp, replace, and continue.I called the company and they sent me a replacement manual and juice recipe book for free.Now that I'm juicing daily, the juicer is still performing well, I may upgrade this year, but I'm happy to recommend this anyone starting out on juicing, or who cannot spend $200 and up for a Professional juicer."
3,Read the instructions,"I've used my Juiceman Junior for over 6 years, and only now do I have replace the cover. It juices well IF you cut up pieces small and don't try to shove a lot in at once. Yes, it can vibrate terribly and then you have to stop the machine, clean the mesh, and go again. If you use small pieces of veg and fruit you can juice quickly. It could get the pulp drier and be easier to clean but then if you want a better juicer pay more money."
4,Nothing better than freash...,"This is a great product, money well spent. Not very difficult to clean. I'm using this for over 2 years. I have a purchased a tooth brush which I use for cleaning the filter. Other parts are very easy to clean. Feeling of drinking fresh juice is indescribable. I purchased this when my wife was pregnant. She drank only fresh juices during her pregnancy. We have a beautiful baby boy and he also likes to drink juices - fresh. This is not a right juicer for making lots of juices at a time. You need to clean in between. We make two glasses without any problem."
1,"Major flaws, NOISE, & worthless company warranty","We have had a terrible time with this juicer. It is incredibly loud and vibrates after only a few pieces of fruit. We have exchaged it three times at Target, trying to get one that works well. No luck. We are now trying to get the Juiceman Manufacturer (Salton, Inc) to honor their one year warranty to refund the purchase price. However they refuse to do so. We are very disappointed and urge Target and other retailers not sell Juiceman Jr."
4,Simple to clean - mine is over 10 years old!,"This is a simple machine that works for the average juice lover. Not great for fibrous leafy greens like kale necessarily, however we do use ours for spinach. Mine is over 10 years old and I have replaced the basket only once. Our family uses this all the time and the kids love it! You have to prep the ingredients and yes juice the apples last but other than that it is small, easy to clean, easy to store and great for our family of 5. We may someday upgrade to an omega or vitamix...but that is an investment we can't seem to justify when this works so well."
1,Run away and buy something else!,"What an utter piece of junk! It was noisy from the start and we should have taken it back when we could. I now see the motor is mounted slightly off keel making the screen rub on the surrounding hopper creating the noise and a burning plastic smell. When juicing it sprays juice with such force that it over shoots a glass and if you didn't put your hand up to block it, it would be all over your stomach. Juice also runs out from the splatter dome on the top down the sides into hard to clean areas of the latches then on down into the seam at the bottom into the motor compartment where there is no way to clean it out creating an unsanitary base unit. Before anyone writes a smart remark, yes it was assembled correctly!"
1,Do Not Buy This Product,"My wife gave me a Juiceman Jr. initially for Christmas. I used it twice, following the explicit directions and juicing only a few carrots and apples. I made sure that I cut the tops off the carrots, removing the seeds and quartering the apples. The second time I used it, the opaque plastic top developed a crack about an inch near where it secures to the base with a set of latches on either side.I promptly packed it up and exchanged it for another one. Today I used the new one (again for the second time.) This time it developed two scrape marks on the tube where you place the fruit/vegetables. This presumably happened from the carrots being pushed through the feeder tube by a plunger that comes with the unit. My point is this- this machine has to be babied, and is definitely not built to last. The plastic top is just not sturdy enough. The price is right, but unfortunately you get what you pay for. Also, the base is white plastic that stains very easily."
1,messy with juicy produce,"I was satisfied with the ease of use and 5-minute cleanup of the machine, but the juicier the fruit, the bigger the mess made around the juicer.The dribble spout from the juicer splatters small amounts of juice and pulp. This can be stopped by placing a plastic lid on the juice receptacle and leaning it over the spout.However, the bigger problem is the pulp ejection spout which causes a large mess when juicing something very wet like watermelon. I tried using a damp towel, but this was ineffective. I had a medium puddle of juice after processing 1/2 of a small melon.Easy to clean and easy to assemble/take apart, but I would only recommend this if you don't plan on processing watermelon or other juicy produce."
1,Do Not Buy This Juicer,I purchased this juicer over a year ago at Target. After the first three uses it was so noisy I could not use it any more. It vibrates out of control and splatters juice everywhere.
1,A Very Bad First Impression!,"Right out of the box, I prepared the Juiceman Jr to be used for the very first time. Much to my shock, THE UNIT BEGAN EATING THE CLEAR PLASTIC FEED TUBE AS SOON AS IT WAS TURNED ON! There were bits of shreaded plastic in the blade and the screen! The smell of plastic filled the kitchen. Apparently the tube is just a bit too long so it touches the spinning blade. Back in the box and back to the store it went.I read another review from someone who had the exact same experience.A company that makes something this bad doesn't deserve a second chance with me. There's too many other brands to choose from."
2,Not if you live in close quarters,"This thing is SO LOUD........like a power tool. It's not very efficient. The pulp is wet when it comes out, so I feel like I'm wasting fruits and vegetables. I would just rather eat them. Cleaning the micro-mesh extractor is tedious."
4,Works well enough for my needs...,"I've had the Juiceman Jr. for almost 8 years now, and it's never failed or broken on me. While I don't use it every day any more (I did for almost a full year). I mostly juiced hard vegetables and fruits (carrots, apples, beets, melons) and the occasional leafy green. It's terrible at juicing greens and melons, but handles the other stuff marvelously. I've since replaced this juicer with a single-auger style that's better at doing wheatgrass, dandilion greens, and the like. It served me well, and I'd recommend it as a first juicer."
3,Not sturdy enough for everyday use..,Having owned a national while living in Asia I bought the juiceman jr to try it out. I have had it for a little over a year..the plastic cover is already broken so I have to get another...while it may work well for occasional use it is certainly not made to withstand everyday use!!!!unfortunately I have not been able to find the national which I used to own...
1,Shredding Plastic Hood,"Sadly, while this juicer has some good features - it is seriously flawed.The plastic one-piece hood that covers the juicer began to touch down onto the stainless steel blade. At first I thought I had shredded something tough (stems from Kale) but later realized that it was chipping away the plastic. I used it for 2 weeks and then returned it."
3,Juiceman Jr,"This product, Juiceman Jr is not as sturdy as the ones in the past. The plastic is not very strong. It arrived with the top broken. We are in the process of having the top replaced. It does perform adequately."
1,Poor product,"The juice man jr. is only good if you juice onces a week! My juice man could not hold up for me at all, it only last a mounth of juiceing every day! I like to juice so I need a better machine that will last! The juice man jr. is not a good machine at all!!1"
1,this juicer sucks eggs!!!!!,"It's not that hard to clean in general but it is very very wimpy. The inner plastic funnel became grated off by a carrot! I do not have my receipt or I would have returned it. This juicer is not durable, is very loud, and does not hold up well. We juice 3-4 times a week, mostly softer vegetables but some carrots. If you juice anything hard you have to stop it and clean it during the juicing. I would think twice before buying this. I know some other models make nut butters and purees. I am kicking myself for not saving my receipt... I would add also that we are on a very limited budget and have been very careful with this, following the instructions, keeping it perfectly level, etc. If you want a juicer, make the investment for a good one. This one sucks!"
1,not very good,"I bought this a year ago and finally opened up the box,well after three days of use, the motor blew out."
5,Everyone loves Pingu,I remember being an older teen and loving when Pingu would come on one of the Canadian stations. I purchased this to share the love with my kids; my 3 year old and 6 year old were laughing out loud while they watched Pingu and his antics.
3,Will adults like it?,"I watched and am writing this review of Pingu from the perspective of an adult who has no children, but I do enjoy claymation, especially from non-US sources.There are a few laugh-out-loud moments. I would compare this to a cross between Teletubbies and Wallace & Gromit, with the weight solidly on the Teletubbies side. You find very simple and repetitive story lines. Without true dialogue, of course, you miss the wittiness and verbal banter of W&G;, and the creators rely much more heavily on sight-gags and prat-falls, which with claymation can be quite funny.Pingu is a lot of fun, though I might suggest NOT watching them all back2back. Try watching a cut every morning when you are at your grumpiest, or at night when you need a good, simple laugh.Will adults like it? I did!***1/2"
4,the pingu woo-woo,"Pingu is wierd,funny,and kid friendly!But he is stupid,wierd,and sometimes boring.My sister loves pingu.When she heard it was not just on youtube...she totally got pingu fever!So people JUST RENT IT DONT BUY IT OK!!!!!"
4,the better packaged of the 2 US DVDs,"Ok well HIT almost got this one right but I think the bonus stuff is annoying and it tells me HIT is short-changing the fans of Pingu to push other product. To me, as my son could care less about the ""bonus features"", this just means less Pingu on the DVD.Given the poor options available in the US. I'd say start here before you buy the tryuly atrociously packaged but never-the-less worthwhile ""Meet Pingu"" as this one (thanks to the menu) will spare your sanity.Having said that, Pingu is a wonderful stop-motion series from Swizerland that really desreves a better release in the states. Pingu and his friends are charming and the stories don't talk down to kids. Your kids will love it!I only wish the people at HIT Entertainment loved it too."
3,Good compilation of records featuring named individuals.,"This book is a good help to those researching family history in this section of the Isle of Wight. Although containing no census data, and only a few parish record entries, it is useful in getting an idea of the local identities and the times they lived in. Of course, not all residents are mentioned, which may disappoint some. However, if you are determined and don't mind reading it from front to back, a few gems may appear."
1,"Oh boy, what did I get myself into!?!","My wife is an Ice Cream addict, so what better gift than an Ice Cream Maker?Not this one...It's a great concept and a great price, just not a great product. If your able to cope with a price per batch that ""Rivals"" the cost of the unit itself and are willing to put up with sounds that ""Rival"" a cement mixer, then by all means pick up a ""Rival Ice Cream and Yogurt Maker"".Oh, and it dosent make yogurt, just frozen yogurt."
5,Love it!!!!!,"This is a great product. It works great and makes delicous ice cream. Yes it is noisy but I mostly use mine during the summer at parties or get togethers, and everyone is usualy outdoors. When I have used while we were all in the house with it, I just moved it to another room. We love the ice cream so the noise is not a big factor for me. As for the person who complained that it was expensive to make the ice cream...........uuuhhhmmmm name one thing that you make from scratch that doesn't cost more than what you can get mass produced. You pay more for quality, taste and the experience of making something great. This is a special treat that my kids love and that is worth the extra cost to me."
2,disappointed with the quality,"the earrings look OK from a distance.i expected a lot better quality from a piece of silver jewelry for US $55 (+ $8.50 shipping + taxes). after looking up close at the wings I am not even sure that it's sterling silver, the color is uneven and it is not marked [925 or anything]. you can find a lot better sterling silver earrings for this price."
4,your dog and your baby,I gave it as a gift and they found it helpful. they have a french bull dog who thinks he is a baby.
2,OVERPRICED,This book looks like a free publication that you would pick up at your vet. It does have very good information but I wouldn't pay over $5 (total) for it.
5,Quick and thorough!,"This is an excellent book! The information is in a quick question and answer format categorized by system (i.e. cardiology). This book is perfect for quick learning sessions when on call, as a break while studying, or for complete board preparation. I highly recommend it."
2,a very average WWE PPV nothing special,1. Rey Mysterio vs R-Truth** Good match2. WWE Intercontinental Championship- Ezekial Jackson vs Wade Barrett* Fairly average id say ok tho3. Sin Cara vs Chavo Guerrero** It was good but not great sin cara messed up a lot that really dragged this match down4. World Tag Team Championship- Big Show and Kane vs CM Punk and Mason Ryan* Not good5. Diva's Championship- Brie Bella vs Kelly Kelly* terrible only one word to discribe it6. World Heavyweight Championship- Christian vs Randy Orton*** finally we have a very good match best match of the night7. Michael Cole vs Jerry Lawler- Kiss my foot match* Match was awful but the surprises were fun at the end of match8. I Quit Match for the WWE Championship- The Miz vs John Cena** Well never seen a more one sided match cena got his butt kicked pretty much theentire match so match really dragged at times not a great match but it was okQuite dissapointed with this ppv luckly i didnt have to pay for it
5,Great dryer!,This is a great blow dryer. It's fast and very quiet! It doesn't have that high pitched scream that other dryers do. The dog will even let us dry him with this dryer! It's got great power and dries my hair 5 minutes faster than my old one.
5,Unbelievable!,"The reviews for this product are what helped me make up my mind to buy it and try it for myself, so thank you to everyone for taking the time to post those. I was a bit doubtful it would work because I haven't had much luck in the past with blow dryers, but with my thick, wavy hair that frizzes in the Florida heat and humidity, I needed to find something that might help. Well, this HELPS! Never has my hair blown out so sleek and shiny before (and so quickly, too), other than when I had it done at the salon. And yes, it's a tad heavier than some models, but the results are worth it, in my opinion! My hair stays smooth and shiny, even after being outside. Conair has hit a home run with this blow dryer! :)"
3,Great product for the price...,"I bought this dryer over a year ago and it still works fantastically. I have straight medium length hair and it dries my hair in 10 minutes or less. I only give it three stars, however, because I find this hair dryer a little too heavy for my liking. Also, the ""cool"" button and all the other functions for the dryer are located on the inner handle which is a bit frustrating since you hold the dryer from its handle. I often find myself accidently pushing down the ""cool"" button. I just turn the ""cool"" button off and the heat immediately starts up again, but I find this so inconveneint and annoying at times. But for the price, I think this is a great buy."
5,Heavy but works well,"i love it, it works great on my hair which is long, thick and wavy. it is a bit heavy but i don't mind since it doesn't take long to dry my hair."
4,Good product,The reason I gave it a 4 is because i think it is a little bulky and heavy. Otherwise good product.
3,Works well but HEAVY,"I actually bought this dryer for my mom but ended up trading my lighter blow dryer for this one. The Conair is quite heavy and it was too difficult for her to use because of her arthritis.It works well but even for me, it is a bit bulky and heavy. If you spend lots of time in a blowdrying session, your arms will get pretty tired. Then again, you may end up with great biceps. :)"
4,"Great Dryer, Bad Placement of Controls","I have been using this dryer for 7 months and really like it. It really dries my hair fast and does not burn it or dry it out. My only criticism is the placement of the controls. It is impossible to completely grip the handle and not touch the temp & speed buttons. I accidentally switch the controls and trigger the ""cool"" button just about every time I dry my hair. This hair dryer is heavy enough that you need to be able to hold onto it. I would like to see the controls moved somewhere off the grip in the next version."
5,Very nice product for the price.,"The drying indeed seems a little faster with ionic. But it is definitely muted in the sound it makes. Every time my wife starts to dry her huge bundle of hair, the hair drier whine used to get me crazy. I feel a lot better now. The build quality is also pretty good and sturdy. For this price, this is definitely one of the best.Enjoy!!"
4,"Like the dryer, dislike the button placements","I really like this dryer. It dries faster than most and does leave my hair softer than my previous blowdryer. It takes a moment or two for it to heat up, but never gets so hot that it would burn me. I love the two attachments and being able to complete 3 types of styles without a problem. The only negative is (as others have mentioned) the ""cool"" button. It is not uncommon for fingers to rest on it while styling and then all my heat is gone. It does need better usability testing."
3,Conair 213X,"I bought this hair dryer for home use to replace my Ionic styler. However, this product is very heavy and difficult for me to handle. I will use it, but do not enjoy it fully. It is very clumsy and if you have difficulty with your arms, shoulder or hands it is not for you."
2,Not Hot enough!,"I did use Sharper Image Ionic conditioning blow dryer for 3yrs. It was quiet and had a large mouth. THis one blew my hair all over the place.My hair is past bra strap lenghth, and it would have taken years to dry it. It was not hot enough for me and in addition to blowing it everywhere. I might still use it for the attachment for curly hair... which i have. If I could i would return it... and I AM a product junkie... however I am fair. I only used it once with out any attachments. If i find that i do like it later down the road... i will repost."
3,low quality controls,"For the price, the control buttons (hot, warm, low, high) should be better made, and easier to use. They are very hard to press with one hand, which is what you need with a blow dryer. Plus, it was heavier than I expected. We returned it."
3,dissapointed,"I was excited for a new hair dryer cause the one I was using was on it's last leg. I read the reviews and thought this one looked good. I was very dissapointed. It's actually too powerful. Using the diffuser attatchment is kind of a joke. It blows your hair everywhere, and that's not really what you want for attatchments. I do have curly hair and i like the heat to be concentrated on just where I want it. It is impossible to do with this dryer. Also the on/off switches are in a stupid place like alot of other hair dryers. I'm not quite sure who designs these things. The positive about this dryer is that I have no frizz after drying. Would not buy this one again."
3,Diffuser issue,"Unless I'm straightening my hair, I always use the diffuser attachment on my hair dryer. I have thin, naturally curly hair that's a few inches past my shoulders. That being said, after about 6 months of using this dryer, the diffuser attachment is completely melted. I've been using hair dryers with diffusers for probably about 15 years now and I've never seen anything like this. The dryer works well, but I'm a little concerned with the melting and I think I'm going to try a different hair dryer."
4,Conair 213XP Infiniti Pro hair dryer,It is a little heavy but also a very good quality product....no problems so far everything works very well...For the price you would pay alot more for this type of hair dryer...a good value.
3,"Works well, but a little heavy and noisy.","It took me a few weeks to get used to this hair dryer. It's heavy and the buttons/adjusters are not in the best place. It's also a little noisy and the ""low"" is not that low. Now that I have gotten used to it, I am okay with it. It just took some getting used to I guess. I still can't give it a 4 or a 5 because I personally wouldn't recommend it."
4,This thing is strong!,"I have owned this dryer since around 2005. i have taken it to 6 different countries, I even fried it in China, or thought I had. I couldn't bear to throw it away, so I held on to it, brought it home, and it worked again! Just yesterday, May 2011, it finally died. I love this dryer, and while it's big, it really worked!"
2,"Close, but no cigar","The basic dryer is solid. I can live with the hefty weight. It's nice and quiet for use with my pets. What kills this thing for me is that the control positions are often inadvertently changed just using the widget normally, which is ANNOYING. This issue includes the cool air button. Overall, this deficiency is so significant to me that I have ordered another dryer and will toss this one."
4,Nice dryer.,"Works well. Pretty quiet. A bit heavy. Hair seems to be alot smoother than with my old dryer. Overall, a good product. Would recommend."
4,Quiet but powerful,"I'm very happy with this hairdryer. It's much quieter than my old Conair hairdryer that's about 5 years old. Also, it dries my hair much faster and tames the frizzies. I have thick wavy hair that takes forever to dry. I live in a humid climate, so trying to keep the frizzies under control is very important. I've noticed that my hair is much smoother using this dryer versus the non-ion hair dryers. My only complaint is the weight...it's a bit heaver than my old drier...good thing it dries my hair quickly."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I purchased this dryer based on a magazine article which had rated it very highly. My first ion dryer had broken (not a Conair), so I was anxious to replace it.First of all, this dryer does absolutely nothing to prevent or lessen the ""frizzies."" Even when I used Frizzease serum first, my hair looks like a fuzz ball after a few minutes.Secondly, I usually hold the dryer with my right hand and a brush with my left. I found the on/off button extremely difficult to slide one-handed, something I've never had trouble with with other dryers. Also, if I hold the dryer where I usually would, I accidentally squeeze the blue ""cool air"" button.Finally, I find this dryer to be very heavy to hold and manipulate. I've purchased other travel dryers for $9.99 and they do a better job than this one for over $30."
2,I expected more....ALOT MORE!,"This has been the first inexpensive blowdryer I have purchased in....years. My high end blowdryer died so I began shopping around to find a new blowdryer. The reviews for the conair were so good that I thought I should give it a shot. It was also so inexpensive. When I got it I expected it to perform the same way my professional dryers did. That's not the case. First, it's VERY heavy! Also, It doesn't straighten my hair as well as the other brands. Finally, it doesn't give you as many heating options. For example, high / low, hot/warm/cold. By the way, the hot setting is far from it. So, in my perspective it's actually an expensive blowdryer because if you have to replace it with something better and lighter then it's just wasted money!"
2,A Weighty Issue,"I purchased this hair dryer online after my old Conair started failing (it had a long life). Most of the reviews made this sound like a great replacement option. While this dryer works perfectly well, I wouldn't recommend that anyone purchase it because it is SO HEAVY. I mean, ridiculously heavy for a blow dryer. My hand and arm actually get tired after using it for just a few minutes. I would have returned the dryer if it had been purchased at a local store--but repackaging it and going to the post office is a real pain. My advice...look for something a little lighter.Conair 213X Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black"
3,Its Ok...,"I was in desperate need of a fabulous blow dryer. After reading all the reviews I purchased the infiniti and thopugh it is good, it is not as great as everyone has stated. It has dryed my hair like any other dryer. Nothing special has been added to the end product. The only noticeable difference between this and other blow dryers is that it does blow dry extremely faster than my old dryers."
4,great product for price!,"Picked this up because my dryer died. It is a little heavy, but it is much quieter than my previous dryer. And it dries my hair faster. Overall, a good value."
5,Best blow dryer I have ever owned,"This is the model with 4 heat and 3 speed settings and it is lighter than the other I think. My curly hair usually gets burned and frizzed out with my older blow dryer, but this one leaves it curly with almost no frizz and makes it look shiny and healthy and bouncy. I use the diffuser, I can't wait to see how my hair comes out when I straighten it."
4,Solid and effective Conair Dryer,"The dryer is heavier than one you can get in a CVS, department or electronics store; however, it is well worth the little extra weight. My hair dries quickly, is smooth to the touch and shiny. Not bad for a 55 year old. I have had professional Conair dryers before and they last a long time."
5,"Love it, I hardly need my flat iron!","I will never buy another hair dryer other than a Conair again. My last Conair was with me for over a decade before it finally died. I went through 3 other brands in as many years before I chose this as my new dryer. I won't look back. Dries quickly, with little frizz and leaves my hair shiny and smooth. I barely run the flat iron through it and I am good to go. A great buy!"
4,Great quality +++,"My other Conair still works, but have had it for a long time and wanted to be prepared if it failed. I love my new Conair!! Seems to dry my hair a little quicker and I don't think my hair is so frizzy. It is a tad heavy, but solid construction. The cool-shot button gets pushed accidentally from time to time, but no big deal. Overall, great product for the price!"
3,really heavy,"I think this is ok for someone who doesn't need to style their hair only to dry it, the dryer is really heavy and the diffuser blows my hair all over the place. Nobody in my house liked it."
3,Way too heavy!,"This hair dryer works well, but it's the heaviest dryer I've ever used. My hair does look nice and smooth, but I wish I had purchased a lighter one."
5,great!,"It cut my hair drying times in half. I have long fine hair that normally takes about 15 minutes to completely dry. With this dryer, it takes about 8 min.The weight was not bad, I'm used to heavier dryers.UPDATE 2011 - This dryer is still very good. However, I found a better one in Babyliss which is WAY lighter and easier to use, just as effective too. See my other reviews since I can't figure out how to link it here :) It's still going strong after 3 years. I use it once in awhile now as I keep it for spare in the guest bathroom."
1,Blower quit working after 6 months,"Initially found the dryer heavy, cord way too long and easy to twist, controls awkward...and then it quit working. Will return to purchasing cheap models that last for years."
2,Works Great but Very Hard To Use,"Pros:This dryer has wider selection options for speed and heat settings than any other dryer I've owned.Cons:This dryer is heavy. Ladies with long, slow-drying hair might think twice. Their arm will get a workout.The handle angle makes it very awkward and tiring to use. The angle is completely opposite of what's needed to dry your own hair. I plan to replace it with another brand for that reason alone."
2,Not enough power,I bought the Conair 213X Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler because it was recommended in an ariticle online by a professional hair stylist. It has proven a disappointment as my hair does not get the styling volume that I enjoyed with my previous unit. The difference seems to stem from the lower heat and air produced by the Conair 213X. Guess you get what you pay for - I'll be buying ANOTHER trully professional hand-held hairdryer soon. Maybe you can avoid this mistake by skipping this one and buying a unit with MORE POWER;-)
2,I got exactly 4 months out of this thing,"I purchased this hairdryer on 1/29/07...and got exactly 4 months out of it. 5/29, the heating element died & now it only blows cold air. I would have given it 1 star, but it worked great till then."
3,Controls are awful!,"I had a CONAIR dryer for nine years and it's finally on its last legs. Got this one after reading the rave reviews. It's quiet, and it dries fast. But if you have even a smidgen of product on your hands, forget trying to operate the controls. I have almost resorted to using my teeth! Very weird, because everything else about this dryer is very good. Oh, and one more thing. Would it have killed them to add a retractable cord?"
4,amazing hair dryer that does not overheat,"I have been searching for a hair dryer that I could use on my hair and my children's hair. Finally I have found one that works for both. It is hot enough to straighten my hair but does not burn it and has a cool setting that it safe to use on my children, who hate to have their hair dried. This Conair product has been a huge help and will last for years. Very good quality for the price. Very happy. Four out of five stars. Took a star off for the delivery complications we had receiving it though."
4,heavy but it works great,I received the Conair hair diffuser and I am exceptionally pleased with the quality of this product. I have seen this in stores near where I reside priced 10 to $15 higher. I am so glad that Amazon.com offers such top merchandise at realistic prices.
2,Not for over 60's,"This blow dryer is not for you if you are 60 or older! It is very heavy and the controls for speed and temperature are difficult to slide up and down. Also, it leaves my hair unusually frizzy. Reviews said that it dries hair really fast, but takes the same amount of time my very old dryer took. Wish I had kept the packaging to return it!"
5,love it,I have curley thick hair that usually takes 45 min. to blow dry. This dryer does it in about 20 min. With the diffuser (and product) I have almost no frizz. I love this dryer.
3,I like it but...,I was using 20 years old hair dryer and I need to dry my 2 daughter's hair quite often. So I decided to buy one which lots of people recommended this..but this is very very heavy dryer!! I thought my wrist will be twisted after drying 2 daughter's hair!
3,It's OK but not amazing...,"I don't usually leave feedback for products but after reading other people's reviews - which ultimately convinced me to buy this product--I thought I should, to be fair. Like many others who left feedback, I have very thick, long hair and bought this dryer in hopes of cutting down my drying time. Other reviews raved about hot powerful and hot this dryer was, but I don't fully agree. My drying time was 45 minutes and is still about 30-35 minutes. I know there are other dryers out there that do the trick, but for me this wasn't one of them. Also it is a pretty heavy device. If you don't feel like dealing with something heavier than the norm, this might not be for you.To be fair, this dryer seems very sturdy and looks like it will last a long time. The extra pieces clip on and stay on (another problem I've had in the past). This is probably a perfect product for people with normal to semi-thick hair, but for me, it just wasn't something I would rave about."
4,Great at-home Hair Dryer,"I bought this to replace a broken Sasoon hair dryer which was purchased at a drug store. I love this dyer: drys quickly, comes with an attachment for when you want straight hair, and another for drying curly hair. It's not all that heavy, and I have not found this to be a problem. It's a solid unit that will hopefully last for a few years. Leaves hair shiny-er than non-ionic dryers. Cons: A little too big to travel with in your carry-on. If you're looking for a new hair dryer to use at home, you should buy this one."
5,Great product!,"I'm so glad I got this for myself. I was looking for an ionic styler that was reasonable priced and works well. This is it! It's a great styler and works really well and doesn't burn my hair. Plus it comes with the attachments which I love.The only thing I don't like is that it's a little heavy but I can work with that.Overall, I'm a very satisfied customer!"
4,Overall - quite satisfied.,This dryer is nice. I don't know if it's any faster but it does work well and my hair really does feel shinnier and healthier. It is a bit heavier than I was used to but not problematicly so.
4,Conair,"Super hair dryer, the only thing negative I've found is the weight of the dryer.It was a little bit heavy on hand but other than that it works really fine"
4,I really like this hair dryer,"This is a really nice hair dryer for the price. It is powerful and much more quite than I thought it would be. It dries my short, but thick hair quickly and the cold shot button really works. It also dries much faster then my old Revlon hair dryer and makes my hair nice and shiny. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because it is a little on the heavy side and I wish the cord was retractable."
4,Would definitely recommend,"I have medium to long length hair and this hairdryer dries my hair pretty quickly. I have had a hair drying in the past that dried it a little faster but I paid more for it. This maybe adds 30-45 seconds to my drying time so I would still rate it as very good. My hair does not have a lot of flyaways or static to it with this dryer either. Wouldn't say it is super smooth, but I've been using it during a humid season so it's hard to say. I would recommend it and I'd most likely buy it again if I had to replace it. I do like it much better than my daughter's Bed Head hair dryer she has. That one is super heavy and doesn't dry quickly at all."
4,Great product!,"I really like this hairdryer. As others have said, it's quite powerful and it makes my hair less frizzy that others I have used. With my old dryer, it would take at least 10 minutes to dry my short hair. With this one, I have knocked off at least 3 minutes. I know it doesn't sounds like a huge difference, but trust me, when you are in a hurry, it matters! They only thing I don't like about this dryer is the weight. My arm gets tired before I am finished drying me hair. Maybe I just need to work out more!"
3,Didn't last long,"This dryer worked well enough for the price, but it died 2 years after purchasing it. It simply won't turn on. I've tried everything."
3,Too loud,"I don't understand the reviews that say this is a quiet dryer: it has the same loud irritating high-pitched whine as most hair dryers. I had to return it, and I'll continue my search for a truly quiet dryer."
5,"Conair 213X Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black","Oh my gosh!!This Conair is the best hair dryer I've ever had.I initially bo't a cheapo Vidal Sasoon for $10.00. It was pretty lightweight, but it got so hot my hair burned-I called it the ""screamin' demon""--the sound was ear-splitting. This wonderful Conair is not loud at all; it has high/low warm settings--the warm is not hot; there is high/low hot setting; and the cool is actually COOL with a high/low setting. It's the best dryer ever for me. This dryer is a little on the heavy side, as I have Lupus with complications, but I will certainly compensate for that by leaning my arm on the counter. My hair shines, it doesn't snarl and knot up, and I'm happy as can possibly be! Buy it, you'll never regret it. Do it now!!"
2,too heavy,"a nice blow dryer, however, ridiculously heavy. when i try to grasp it higher on the handle to lessen the weight, i keep pushing the cool button...so it's very awkward to use for me, unfortunately, because if it were lighter, it would be ideal. great attachments, great dryer. it only takes me about 5 minutes to blow dry my hair but that is too long with this one!"
4,Heavy and heavy duty.,This hair dryer is big and heavy but thankfully it dries hair pretty quickly and doesn't seem to damage my fine hair like other super hot dryers. I don't have tons of thick hair so it works for me but people with long thick hair would also have tired arms.
2,Not a perfect one!,"I wanted to change my hairdryer to get a lighter and a more quiet one! but I think I haven't made a good purchase, this hair dryer is too heavy and also makes lots of noise. But don't back up, overall it's not that bad!"
4,Bit heavier,"This is a great styler. Works faster than the older Conair models and is very powerful. Wife has cut down her hair drying time by 20 minutes with this baby, and as a big bonus, it's very quiet compared to other stylers. There's also a noticeable difference in the look and feel of her hair The only thing is that it's a bit heavier than her old styler (a 1850W conair, I'm guessing the tourmaline makes this one a tad heavier), but it's not too bad, it's a matter of getting used to the styler's weight. Your arm will adapt. The attachments are sturdy and very convenient."
4,"Excellent dryer, but yes it's heavy!","I just used my new Infiniti dryer this morning and I really do like it. It's quieter than my previous one, yet powerful enough to dry my hair quickly. I straighten my hair, so I will be using the concentrator much more than the diffuser. It's nice to have the cold option so I can give my hair a little blast at the end. Like some of the other reviewers noted, holding the handle can get a bit clumsy (my fingers slipped on the buttons a couple of times) and the dryer itself is heavy (I think the description says it's just over three pounds). I'm sure I'll get used to the weight, however. Also, this dryer catches anything in its path -- I had a couple of towels hanging in my bathroom and the dryer kept sucking them in! All in all, a very professional hair dryer at a budget price. Conair puts out the best."
5,Best Choice!!!,Best choice !! 10 out of 10. U'll never regret...It can be used for straightening.....Love this product. Will surely recommend this product.....
3,Too Heavy,"Did a great job blow drying my hair, but the dryer is too heavy for me so I am exchanging it for something lighter. Also, the cool button is located right where your index finger goes, so you end up accidentally pressing it quite a bit."
3,Not as powerful as I thought it would be,"I bought this to replace my Conair Yellowbird. For me, I need the air, not heat. It does not produce as much forced air as I thought it would."
4,Good buy,"Best hairdryer purchase so far. Dries fast, makes hair silky and can't beat the price. Only negative is that the dryer is on the heavy side... Still a keeper."
3,"Works well, but....","This is a good hair dryer, and definitely made my hair softer than the real cheapo discount store ones, however....it's VERY heavy, in fact I know I've never felt a heavier one, so if you have arthritis or any hand condition, you may want to skip it. Also, the cool button is very easy to accidently push (if you are right handed) and the control buttons are rather hard to move up and down. Maybe they will ""loosen"" up with time.So, I like the effect this dryer gives, but the design was not very well thought out."
2,Heavy and short diffuser fingers,"I bought this hairdryer to replace a hairdryer I had gotten free from my mother (nothing special). For my prior hairdryer I used a attachable diffuser that cost $5 from the beauty supply store. Sadly, it seems that purchase was better as this item is heavy and has short diffuser fingers. Based on the other reviews I thought I would see great results for my long, curly hair. Instead it ends of frizzy. Yuck!"
4,Very nice dryer,"This product works great. It dries my hair somewhat faster, but the biggest difference is that it leaves it so much smoother than a dryer without the tourmaline technology does. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's pretty large and heavy."
1,Heavy and only gets hot on High - Hard to turn on/off,"It's abnormally heavy and hard to turn on and off if your hands are damp from your hair or have hair product on them. It over all works well, I've had it for two years and no problems, but adds a lot of weight to suitcases and my arm gets tired holding it."
3,Good Quality...BUT,The quality of the product is very good. It feels like it will last a long time.does wonders on my hair.
4,great dryer,Great Dryer for the price! Is a little heavy but I expected that from the other reviews. Nice long cord. I seem to hit the buttons on the handle (on and off and heat buttons) when drying but nothing that would stop me from buying this dryer again.
4,"great dryer, great price","Really great value for money, good settings, cold, warm, hot, high, low. Everything you want from a hair dryer. Bit on the heavy side, but that's normal for a good dryer. Leaves my hair smooth and frizz free."
4,"It's good, but not as great as my old hair dryer","this hair blow dryer is good, but the conair that i had before (which died on me), was much hotter, which i LOVED. this one is great with the attachments because i use them and i didn't have them before, so that is a great bonus. however, i miss the heat. the drying time seems to be about the same. but my hair does seem softer. so less heat, probably is better for my hair!so who knows, maybe i'll grow to LOVE this one. and then it will die on me......"
5,Excellent quality - great price,"This dryer seemed a little heavy at first, but this unit is not a toy and should last a long time. Fast delivery."
5,Gets it done.,"My girl loves it, so I can't complain. She has A huge main of curly red hair, And I mean it's so serious. But she says this blow dryer gets it done quickly, comfortably and with seemingly little frizz."
1,Very dissappointed!!,"This slipper is so hard. I am dissappointed that I bought it for my daughter, because it is definately not for the feet of a child. Strictly for hard feet persons.I would not recommend purchasing this item."
2,"good quality, poor design","Installation would have been great but they shipped one stud and two bolts for the mount. Trying to start the threads of the steel bolt into the cast pot metal housing was near impossible. I ended up having to buy more metric studs in order to install. Other than that the fit was perfect.But now the problem. First of all they will not fold in for storage - they only fold forward but then the $300 truck cover no longer fits. So now I have to have a custom truck cover made?Then the biggest problem - when these mirors are in their ""operating"" position they are actually angled rearward almost 45. That places them well beyond any normal persons range of peripheral vision meaning that you cannot see anything without physically turning your head. So forget picking up any action or movement ""out of the corner of your eye"". All in all I will be looking for a replacement that resolves these problems ans these will be on Craig's list asap."
1,Nice but...,"this ring is nice and fancy with the design it have, but because of that design, while my wife was adjusting it, broke in half the first time, soo theres no much to say about this."
3,Be Prepared to Make Some Substitutions,"If you are expecting this to be a book of vegetarian recipes, be forewarned. Several of the recipes call for beef or chicken flavored bouillion cubes. Of course, you can usually find vegetarian versions of these seasonings.To be fair, the book does not claim to be vegetarian and the dessert recipes are yummy."
5,"High quality, priced right, and Made in the USA","I installed a set of these springs for a customer of mine on his new porch swing. Unlike most porch swing springs that you find, this design works by ""compression"" rather than ""extension"". So you & your swing won't end up on the ground if the spring ever breaks 10 years from now when you've forgotten that it's even there. The spring is made out of a heavy gauge wire, and it's finished in a bright zinc uniform plated finish. Very nicely made. I don't usually get excited about springs, but it's so nice to come across an item that is well made, VERY reasonably priced, and Made in the USA. Oh - and it does soften the seat just a bit when you sit down, so you do notice an improvement. What's not to like?"
1,Hugo Fan!!,I found it strange that I was sent perfume that was not sealed. I am a Hugo Boss fan and the smell of this particular cologne was not as strong as the bottle that I purchased sealed from a store. Its too much of a hassle to mail back so I gave it to a friend as a present. Would definately not buy cologne from this store again.
2,"Are you guys serious? Hugo ""boss"" big disappointment!!!",I tried this sample of hugo boss just to see why people say it's so good but I think it's to overrated.It's more alcohol than what they say it's in it.It would give u a headache after an hour. They really messed up by putting vanilla and apple in the ingredients.The better one out there is Dolce & Gabbana ''The One'' a few bucks more.
2,Different from Department store cologne,I have been using Boss No 6 cologne for a long time. I bought this new 6.7oz from Amazon recently not happy at all. This new cologne doesn't stay on your skin or doesn't smell like department cologne. I think all this cologne are fake or too old. Also cologne box was broken. Hope this helps.
3,Nice Perfume,"I earlier on bought two bottles of this perfume to be given to some friends and later decided to buy another one for myself. It is a real nice perfume. I however noticed a difference in the product package of the first and second consignment. The first product had the BOSS printed smoothly on it while the second one had it more or less embossed. I decided to spray the two products on two different shirts at the same time and observe. About 6 hours after, I could not smell the first product but the second one stayed for well over a day. Both products were from Amazon and I wondered why. In general however it has a sweet scent. But for this difference which I cannot understand, I would have given it a 5 star"
2,I doubt it's genuine,I received the bottle without plastic shrink wrapped. Also there is no product introduction sheet inside the box which is supposed to be included. I doubt it's genuine from Boss. I don't recommend this products to anyone.
3,Caveat - even if it 'ships from and is sold by Amazon.com'...,"I love this cologne, but it does arrive in suspicious condition.Of all the colognes I have bought on amazon, this one came in a box that was not shrinkwrapped, and even stranger, the serial number on the bottom of the box does not match the number on the bottle. I mean, what's up with that?I get maybe 1-2 hours from this before it sticks so close to my skin that it's essentially over. So it's good for my commute up until lunchtime. Since this is my first bottle of Boss Bottled, I don't know if that's more or less what this fragrance should be doing.But an unwrapped box with mismatched serial numbers? Really?And this was absolutely ""shipped from and sold by amazon"", NOT a 3rd party seller (it was shipped Prime, as well).I would reconsider if you're going to buy this here. In the future, I will buy other colognes at amazon, but this brand will be purchased retail - it's worth the few extra bucks."
4,very good,"My sister was sent these smelling tablets and one of them had this calogne on it. I loooved the smell and ordered just a small portion of it. It came and i started to wear it. Imedietly i felt its power working. Everyone complimented me and i gotta say it boosted me up- i did end up being more confident and comfortable witht his calogne on and it made me perform better. Great stuff, cant wait till i run out to order a larger oz. bottle. :D"
5,"Great Product by HUGO Boss, amazing packaging and delivery by amazon","Its a great product... I searched for it in physical stores but they dint carry 100 ml bottle. Found it on amazon, delivered very fast and in perfect packaging.. I am really delighted to have it and recommend users to order all the fragrances thru amazon if they know the product."
1,Not the original product..,"I've been wearing this product for many years now, and this is the first time I've ordered online..Immediately upon spraying the smell was wrong, and after sitting on the skin for a minute, there's nothing that resembles the original fragrance at all.. This smells like cheap vodka from a supermarket, I imagine.. And after half an hour there's nothing left to smell at all..In addition to that, the regular product doesn't sting my skin when it hits a freshly shaven face.. This stings like a bugger!!My mistake for buying online at this price.. I should have known.. I shall stick to shops where I get the real thing.."
5,Amazing ! NOT watered down,"I bought this for my boyfriend & it smells fantastic ! I saw some reviews saying it was watered down before buying it, but decided to try it anyways. Im happy I did because it's great :)"
2,Hugo Boss Boss,HI DearI received one of hugo Boss Boss items empty it doesn't has perfume because its cover has problem.thanks
1,Disappointing,I've used Boss cologne for 4 years and this time the item seemed very diluted and almost ineffective. My girlfriend didn't even notice it any more! :-(
4,good & doesn`t last,"it`s nice fragrance it has unique scent but it doesn`t last long, Hugo by hugo boss it`s better than this one ."
3,Stevie Knows Better...,"This was a good book, but I wouldn't really consider it to be great. When her friend gets hurt on a horse Stevie lies to protect her from her parents' wrath, but she could have caused a disaster. I learned a lot about maple sugar from this book, but I was upset that Stevie kept lying and cheating."
4,a fun read,"In this book, Stevie goes to visit her equally horse-crazy and less mischievous friend Dinah in Vermont. They and a friend attempt to ""tap"" the most trees in a contest the trainer of Dinah's stable has set up. The winners get first pick of their horses for lessons next summer. Unfortunately, their fun is marred when Dinah and Stevie are unwittingly sent on a dangerous trail ride, and the girls must conceal the injuries Dinah sustains from a fall or risk Dinah losing her riding privileges. But when their secret threatens to put more riders at risk, they must decide whether to break it."
4,Wonderful,"I don't know a whole lot about classical music, nor do I know much about the nuances of different recordings or performances. But this is wonderful."
1,All three dry,"Neat idea, having a pen inside the stylus. Would have been even neater if at least one of the three had any ink."
4,"Lots of information, not too emotional","This video does a great job of exploring the facts behind the story of Jesus. At the same time, it isn't a setup for a good ending.The experts are truly experts in their fields and the subjects are honest."
5,Wonderful!,"We really like this waffle iron compared to other models that we have tried. It never burned them. With it's stylish design, we have nothing to complain about. I must first say that we didn't expect too much as it was a gift to us from people who knew nothing about cooking anything. My wife is a culinary genius in the kitchen so we were all awaiting her approval. Her exact comments were, ""I want to buy another one so that we can have two"". We have 6 children and the only complaint from the house was that they weren't coming fast enough! We are very pleased."
5,KISS,"Making a perfect waffle should not require Betty Crocker, or Martha Stewart. This product is designed with simplicity and practicallity in mind. Even though it has the good looks of a fashion model, it is as easy to use as the girl that you wouldn't take home to Mom. If you want flawless waffels at an economical price, and without much thought, this is the one for you."
5,Must read for anyone in the triad,"I discovered this book quite by accident. I had already read Birthright by Jean Strauss. I was doing a search on Amazon for a review of that book for a friend when this title came up. When I finally got a copy, I couldn't put it down. Simply, it is an incredibly well written book on searching for one's roots. In the end, its both one's adoptive and biological ties that matter. I particularly appreciated the author's final family tree which included both her birth family and adoptive family. The insight I received from this book will be invaluable to my wife and I as we raise our 7 yo son and 2 yo daughter who were both adopted as infants. Many thanks to Jean Strauss."
5,"Creamy, consistent results","Have used this product for a couple of years now, gets harder to find at the store so have turned to ordering over the internet. When used with fat-free half-and-half makes a creamy, smooth ice cream everyone has enjoyed. Easy to add fruit to and combines well during mixing. The texture of the end product is so rich, no one has guessed I'm using fat-free additives either!"
2,The grip sucks at certain angles.,"Used this to replace my motorcycle oil filters. I can see this being useful in a car or someplace where you have more room around the filter. Maybe it's jut the way mine was, but I couldn't get a good grip on the thing even though it's supposed to work at different angles."
4,its ok for a few uses,"for 4 bucks, great tool,, but it bent on me the first really hard filter to get loose..... good for a home guy, not a pro..."
1,Biggest piece of crap,"don't buy this. I just used it, doesn't grip worth a damn. Seriously, don't waste your money. Get the rubber kind, not this steel tension crap."
1,If only the author was actually a collector...,"The prices listed in this book were not even accurate in 1995, so why should they even be close now?? The author was obviously not an actual yo-yo or spin top collector, and it really shows all through the book. They actually took a picture and listed a price for half of a Duncan Twin Spin. Not the whole top, just part of it. Didn't even seem to know what it was, either. If you are buying tops or yo-yos, and someone quotes prices from that book, run away."
2,cheap barely lighted mirror,On other reviews it was stated the paint was chipping off. One of my mirrors was recieved the same way. The light bulb used is only visible at night.
5,Fun to read and much more,"This book is fun to read because the writing is crisp and fast-paced with funny dialogue, but it is more than that because of its serious subject. The reader does indeed sympathize with the main character who is a very bright boy who feels dumb because of his learning disability. When the main character gets help in the end of the story, the reader shares his joy and sense of triumph. I coordinated an authors' festival in which children's authors were invited to visit seven schools in the Downers Grove area. Jamie Gilson visited several of our schools. Many students read ""Do Bananas Chew Gum?"" among other titles. The students enjoyed the books and were very excited about meeting Ms. Gilson. I personally spoke to two special education teachers who loved ""Do Bananas Chew Gum?"" and wanted to purchase whole sets of the book."
4,"Great CD, my family really likes it!","We just got back from Disney World and wanted a variety of Disney music to remind us of the trip. This is a great set of CD's! There are a few lesser known songs that I wish were replaced with a more popular song, but there aren't too many. Overall a very nice set that my family loves!"
1,Missing Index/Song Titles,I'd buy this CD if the contents were listed. There is a listing on the back of the album (you have to click on the photo of the album) but it is difficult to see what the songs are. Why has the index of songs been left out of the product information?
5,Works Great,I really like using this detergent because I know I am doing something good for the environment. Also it does not leave any heavy perfumes on the clothing. They just smell clean.
1,"""Some beautiful facts have destroyed an ugly theory.""",http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/health/newsid_1295000/1295171.stmThree independent research teams have debunked this theory.
3,"Well written and extrememly convincing, but . . .","While this book was well written and very convincing, it has since been proven wrong.Modern experimental evidence conducted and obtained since the book was published (and because it was published) has all but debunked Hooper's theory.For those interested, I suggest going to a medical or collge library and reading the following paper for a good review of the scientific data:""CHAT oral polio vaccine was not the source of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 group M for humans.""Clinical Infectious Diseases2001;32:1068-1084Hooper's work is an excellent example of how, if one is not careful, one can interpret data to mean anything one wants it to."
3,gratitude,"I am greatly surprised at some people's reaction of Dr. Koprowski's role. First of all, nothing is scientifically proven yet, it is only a hypothesis. Dr. Koprowski saved millions of people from poliomyelitis and tested this vaccine on himself, his colleages and family members. Maybe it is time to admit that he developed this vaccine before Salk and Sabin did and, at least, give him credit for helping to elliminate such horrible disease from the face of the earth. And this has been already proven! Where is our simple gratitude?"
5,"Hypothesis, evidence, conclusion","Edward Hooper's The River is a fascinating and intriguing look at one possible explanation for the origin of the AIDS pandemic. Perhaps equally important is Hooper's examination of the scientific process of discovery and testing. No matter how one decides to view Hooper's conclusion (which I found to be very persuasive), he provides us with an outstanding example of the execution of a comprehensive research design. He offers us a hypothesis, collects and presents evidence, then draws conclusions from this evidence. He concludes by addressing the ""where do we go from here"" issues that quality research ultimately generate. As one who has a keen interest in AIDS and its impacts, I read the book with interest and an open-mind. As one who is struggling to write a dissertation, I read it with awe and envy."
5,This book is more frightening than any Stephen King novel.,"I bought this book on and could not put it down. It is a tremendous read on many levels. It is well researched, logically argued, and well written. As a piece of literature it ranks with the very best of Conan Doyle. As a piece of Social Science research, it is the best I have ever read. Hooper's arguments remind me of Rachel Carlson's Silent Spring. He clearly proves that transgenetic accidents like OPV/HIV are not only possible but also probable. After reading the book, when someone asks me who killed the most people in the 20th century, I will answer them--Koprowski. Thank you very much Edward Hooper for searching for the truth. Humanity owes you a lot."
5,"The River is a thousand page ""page turner!""",A fascinating cautionary tale for the next millennium. A MUST for your bookshelf!
1,Didn't really do it for me,"I got these just so I could put a pair in my dress shoes. For some reason my feet get ripe in those things. While I was at it a threw a pair in my work boots. The first day they slid around, and were extremely uncomfortable, the crumpled up, shifted and completely squished, not very ""insole"" like at all. So I got some sticky stuff and made sure they were secure firmly to the bottom. They still bunched up a little and squished down against the shoe. On top of all this, they did absolutely nothing to fight odor. I have this cheap dollar store foot powder that works so much better, I was just kind of hoping to use insoles instead, but I guess not....at least not these ones."
3,Expensive but does the job,"I have used these sole before and they work somewhat to remove the odor from the shoes. But these are much cheaper in Walmart and some other stores, but I could not find them in the nearest Walmart this time and had to order them from here. But except for the price these are totally recommended."
4,Just what I ordered,The product is just what I ordered. Very much needed for sneakers and sock-less foot wear.
2,What were they thinking?,"I work long shifts and needed something to take care of the inevitable sweat situation. This product smells considerably WORSE than sweaty feet. Not sure how they managed that. Just toss some dryer sheets in your shoes half way through the day. Smells better and you can pick a scent other than ""death."""
1,Winner Takes All / A Sensitive Passionate Man [Slim Case],The quality of this DVD was absolutely terrable. It is unwatchable and reminds me of a home made DVD. I was ripped off.RegardsPaul Norris
4,A very solid singer/songwriter album,"I just got this album after seeing the artist play live with Philip Hamilton, in which capacity he was much more of an instrumentalist and sideman. So I was a bit surprised at 637 Sounds--it is not nearly so much a musical showcase (I was expecting something closer to a Victor Wooten album) as a collection of songs by a singer/songwriter who happens to play the cello in innovative ways.To be honest, Mr. Exter is an unbelievable cellist and that is not seen on this album--but it isnt the point either. The songs are all well crafted and the album is very cohesive. It is a very chill album, very approachable and easy on the ears. There isnt a whole lot of variety or complexity, but for just sitting back and listening on a rainy day its really exactly what you want. I would definitely recommend 637 Sounds to any fan of singer/songwriter type music, and I would also keep an eye out for new levels of sophistication and groove on Mr. Exter's next album."
5,spray is spray,what is there to say? it sprays and it sticks. not more more is needed for my purposes. a good deal
3,go spray,this is the on spray adhesive i use. it works well just stand back... you might get sticky if you are careful
3,It's okay,"It works really well on paper and photos, but you have to be extremely precise because the glue dries so fast that it does not allow adjustments. Also, I've used it to glue pieces of linen to three cork panels, creating a pinboard. Unfortunately, it was really difficult to get a well distributed application. As a result, in the first panel, some of the glue passed through the fabric and end up staining it. It was difficult, but I managed to avoid this on the other panels.Overall, it's a very good adhesive but with a few application issues."
5,this is exactly what i hoped it would be,"i recently bought a floatation waterbed and needed a new frame so dad built me one. 2x4s are boring looking, so i wanted to decorate it so i bought some contact paper from amazon that is a white suade like my mattress is , but the paper wouldnt stick. i sprayed this on the wood frame and the contact paper stuck absolutly perfectly. it holds really strong, even on this wood ( that sucked up other glues/paint instantly) another thing i liked is that it doesnt spray everywhere, i could easily control it spraying on a 4 inch wide area.( i still put down plastic) i didnt have to open the windows, but i am in a very large room, and it doesnt smell overwhelming and didnt give me a buzz, haha ( i did NOT want a buzz, let me clarify that ) i would buy this again for my next prject"
5,It really sticks!,"Used this product to adhere polyester batting to foam cushion inserts. A light coating, according to the instructions, really gives a good bond. Be sure to use in a well ventilated area."
5,Foam Cushion,"We bought this to repair a torn foam-rubber cushion insert that would have been very expensive to replace. Warning! This spays like spray paint, so mask off the areas you don't want the glue to be and use plenty of newspaper.After insuring you only get glue where you want it use as directed. The repair job bonded great and we noticed no stiffness as a result of the glued area. Perfect!"
5,works great.,"it works very nicely on things such has pictures which I glue to my wall(dont ask.) if it is more durable than paper, you will be able to remove the object fairly easily AND wash the stuff off"
4,My dogs love them,"My dogs love these things. Just wish they were less expensive. On the other hand, maybe you get what you pay for in terms of quality."
5,Great for Training Treats,"I have used these as training treats for better than a year. My maltese loves them. I don't find them to have a bad odor in the least. They are soft, so easily cut into tiny pieces for training. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone.I feel they are safe and healthy for the little furbabies!"
2,peeeeuuuwwww,"These things stink! Our dog loves them, I'll give them that, but they smell soooo bad, no one in the family will give her one. Instead of fighting because they don't want to walk the dog, now they fight over who has to give her her treat after. ""It's not my turn!!"""
1,Don't read this book,"Instead of focusing on Shatner's life and being a true ""autobiography"", all this book does is tell us all the bad things he has done. And you know what? Most of them aren't even true. Want an example? Ok, here's one: This book claims that Shatner had a fight with Marina Sirtis(Counselor Troi)and got most of her scenes cut from Star Trek Generations. Without taking into account the fact that this would be totally and completely IMPOSSIBLE for an actor to do,let me tell you what Marina said about it in an interview in Star Trek Communicator. She said ""This whole thing that appeared in the tabloids about us having a fight wasn't true. I didn't even see Shatner once during the filming of the movie."" So there you have it. That is just one of the many lies I discovered in this book. Of course, what do you expect when the back of this book lists tabloids like ""Star"" as one of its sources for information?"
3,If faint praise is damnation...,"Then faint damnation must be praise. Although written with marginal competence (the arguments are often specious and/or circuitous), this attempted hatchet job at the (in)famous pop culture icon actually reveals an intelligent, thoughtful, and thoroughly (self)tormented individual who tried to be the next Olivier but happened to wind up as a national punchline instead. How must the man feel? That it is a question of any importance to me actually gives Captain Quirk some value, which it would not ordinarily achieve from either a journalistic or literary point of view."
1,"POOR ""Customer Service""","Be careful ordering from this merchant. Ordered this slow cooker on 12/10/07 for a Christmas gift, my ""confirmation"" said delivery estimate 12/14/07 - 12/19/07. Never heard a word from PresentsForYou. Received notification email from Amazon (thank you, Amazon) that the order had not yet been ship-confirmed by PresentsForYou, & that I could contact PresentsForYou for more information about this order, including the expected ship date, that I may contact the merchant directly by replying to the e-mail message, which I did. I never heard anything from them, & had to go through Amazon to cancel the order."
3,Re:F.Y.I. product recall,"For all of negative comments concerning the handles, please be advised that Iwas informed of a product recall concerning this problem. I followed the recall instructions and received a replacement heating element in July of 2005 that so far has not been a problem. Why the other people did not know of the recall I can't answer, but I did register my purchase with the manufacturer."
1,Stay Away!,"This product was horrible! I had the same problem with my handles, luckily I never picked it up while full because I could see the cracks. It stayed super hot because it is made of metal. To add insult to injury, the metal casing was sitting on my kitchen table getting ready to be put back in it's home and my son accidentally knocked it on to the floor. It was so cheap the heating element literally fell out of the bottom. I will NOT buy this one again, you can bet your life on it. Even though it looks good, safety and QUALITY come first."
3,Broken Handles? There's a recall - get it replaced for free,"Like others here, I was very disappointed when the handles on the side of this Crock Pot started cracking and crumbling to pieces. I found out there's a recall for this Crock Pot due to this issue. Check out www.rivalrecall.com for details (you cut the plug off of your Crock Pot base, send it to them, and they'll send you a new base - you keep the same crock and lid). Overall I give the product 3 stars since it still gets very hot to the touch. I wish the handles hadn't failed as they did, but I appreciate Rival shipping me a replacement free of charge."
2,"It has its problems, very poor customer support","As others have mentioned, this product becomes too hot to touch so I just use potholders when handling it.My crock pot was part of a recall because of the handles cracking and breaking. I followed the instructions to get the part replaced at no charge. I waited eight months for the new part and had to make numerous phone calls. I heard every excuse from they were back-ordered to my order was never received. Friends told me just to go buy a new one because it was the principle of the matter that made me persevere and wait for the recalled part.When the food comes up and simmers, the lid bounces around on top and spews steam, creating quite a mess. I have to wedge a toothpick between the lid and the pot to prevent this from happening. It needs some sort of venting system.The cooking pot itself is rough on the the bottom and has scratched the living daylights out of my stainless steel sink.On the bright side, it does actually cook the food."
2,Cracked Handles!,"In agreement with the rest of the posts on this item...Our crock pot lasted two years (receiving it as a wedding present), and upon pulling it out of the cabinet yesterday, the handles cracked and fell off! Now, we have to buy a replacement that will cost more money??? Can't they put out a stainless steel crock pot built to last???Don't buy this product unless you want to replace it every couple of years!"
1,Cheap Plastic Parts,"So my lid handle broke off after only a few uses. Went to the Crock Pot website to get a new handle and they only sell complete new lids, out of stock of course. Then I went ahead and ordered a new generic fits-all knob from another website which just arrived. To my dismay the way Rival assembles the lids to the knobs makes it so you cant simply replace the knob, only the whole lid. Makes sense now, they just want you to buy a whole new crock pot since on their website the lids are always out of stock.Now I have a crock pot with no lid, and no way to replace either. Do you think I'm going to buy another Rival Crock Pot?"
1,Same problems with shoddy handles and temp knob,"I love to cook in crockpots. I am a working mom and wife and need to be able to use a slower cooker a lot. We bought this one because it is so pretty and seemed to be good quality. After four uses, the handle on the left side cracked and half of it broke off. The right handle is cracked as well. The temperature knob was the next to go. Since I like the look of the pot, I was going to take advantage of the good price on Amazon to buy another, but after reading the other reviews with the same problem, it appears that Rival is not going to do anything to fix these known defects. Do not buy this pot!!!"
1,No stars for this Crockpot,This is the second 4qt Rival Crockpot I have had break. The handles cannot withstand the heat and if moved they splinter and break posing a definite safety issue. After the 1st one broke I had the company send another one and after just 4 uses it also broke. This product needs serious investigation.I also own another larger crockpot from this company and have had no problems with it after 6 years of use.
1,Bad customer service,"I had this pot for about two months, using it once a week, when one handle, then another, cracked. The sides are too hot. It spits out the sides of the lids. Food burns to a crust on the sides. I have had larger, older, Rival pots last for years. Lately, I don't know why they just feel cheap. I also had the bottom of the matching 5 quart size suddenly unravel while I was carrying a crock full of meatballs from the kitchen to the dining room and the crock fell to the ground with the heating element exposed. Always used pot holders, always filled up food to over halfway. Did all as expected, but the screws unravel or broke inside between the layers of the aluminum sides. Can't buy replacement parts easily. Can't reach a person at the Rival website."
1,Handles and temperature knob cracked and falling off!!,I only have used this about 8 times for just my husband and myself. I took it out yesterday and the temperature knob fell off in two pieces in my hand. Then I noticed the handles are all cracked and ready to come apart. VERY DANGEROUS. This gets very hot and if lifted it would cause a real problem.
2,Switch may malfunction,"The low setting on this crockpot turned out to be a high setting. It ruined two meals before I was sure.It is not salvageable, and too much time had elapsed, I didn't keep the receipt. It never occurred to me that the thing wouldn't work properly. Next time I will be more careful in case of a return."
3,Great Performance / Criminal Editing,The good news: This was an excellent performance with outstanding video & audio quality as well as great camera angles.The bad news: Whoever edited this thing made poor use of the available footage. For some reason they change cameras every two seconds with no regard for what was taking place on stage. It's annoying and a shame some thought wasn't put into the final product.
3,Great Gig,"This DVD has an excellent sounding audio track, especially in DTS 5.1 surround - killer! The video is what took me from a 5 to a 3 star rating. First, the image isn't as crisp as some concert videos I've seen (Clapton-One More Car, and Eagles-Hell Freezes are both A+ for video quality). Second, the editing is two rapid- cut to Phil, cut to Tony, cut to Chester, cut to an audience long shot: very 80's MTV. I just wanted the camera to hold on a front row view for a bit and let me soak it in. Awesome show though."
3,Sound Problems But Great Performance,"The performance is great, but if you listen closely, the volume swells up and down throughout most of the songs. Most evident on ""mama"" and the beginning and soft breakdown on ""Domino"". It's as if someone applied limiters to excess on the mastering of the sound, and it's gone crazy."
5,oops,I must make a correstion from my review. That problem with the picture that I mentioned does not exist on this dvd. It turned out to be my dvd player that has the problem because I noticed the same thing on other dvds. The picture on this dvd is perfect.
4,Sad to see them sell out,Most would appreciate success of one of their favourite groups. Its just so sad to see this and what could have been. The disappearing support had already begun before this. In taking the band in this direction creativity has suffered in the same way Pink Floyds creativity suffered. That is not to say these men are not skilled but of course BIG BUSINESS is simply Too Big and requires insational amounts of money to supposedly satisfy.
5,Genesis at their Very Best,"I was never lucky enuff to see Genesis live back in the 80's or 90's but i'm Finally going to see them this year (2007) in Chicago and i'm about as excited as a lil kid on x-mas morning. When I bought this concert on VHS way back in 1990, I was in absolute heaven cuz it's surely the next best thing to being there and flawless from beginning to end. Some of the standouts from the show were - Abacab, Home by the Sea, Land of Confusion, Domino & Los Endos. Now that this concert is on dvd with digital sound/pic & contains extras like interviews with the band, it's even that much sweeter. I own about a hundred concert videos by many popular bands from the 80's, 90's, etc... but this one really stands out from the rest of the pack becuz of it's song selection, location, raw energy, sound & picture quality, camera work and above all else, the superb performances by Phil & the rest of the guys. Basically, This dvd shows Genesis in their prime & is a Must own for any fan."
1,Snoozer,"This DVD should have been called the ""It's all about me: Phil Collins show"". See Phil drum. See Phil chat up the audience. See Phil do a lousy cover of Mick Jagger. For those who still remember the question on the average Genesis fan's mind in the 70s; ""who really is the creative heart of the group genesis?"", this DVD makes it clear its certainly not the remaining members of Genesis. Just compare the musicianship and stage presence of Peter Gabriel in something like the DVD ""Growing Up Live"" and you'll understand.The sound quality is muddled but passable. The setlist disappointingly shallow. The video editing mediocre, particularly on the last few songs. By the standard of something like ""Eagles: Farewell Tour 1"" this DVD doesn't measure up."
4,Imagine a time...,"Imagine a time when musical acts actually attempted to do something new and unique. They pushed the envelope. They dared to scorn the critics. They had 10's of thousands of fans in the palm of their hands, screaming at the top of his/her lungs. Yes, that was the Genesis of the mid '80s. This video snapshot shows the band at the height of its pop apogee with a dose of the strange beauty that only true purveyors of music can appreciate. The cover-song pop/rock medley at the end brings the estatic crowd to a frenzy. It is magical to see older videos that you have never seen before of bands in the prime of their careers."
1,Soup for dessert anyone??,My husband and I recieved this Ice Cream Maker for our wedding and we finally got to use it- the directions simply state that the degrees of the ingredients BEFORE you put them into the machine must be 32 - 40 degrees - i took the temp- with my kitchen thermometer then i proceeded to put the machine on and pour the ingredients into the machine Now from this time on it should have taken 20 - 30 minutes I was determined so i kept it on for a full hour and 20 minutes STILL NOTHING it was soup finally I shut it off and put our soupy dessert in the freezer - Im thankful i wasnt having a dinner party and my guests werent waiting!
1,JUNK!!,JUNK!! Don't buy! Couldn't even make one quart of ice cream on this excuse of an ice cream maker.
2,Cracked Base,"After a couple of years of casual use, my bowl also cracked in the freezer. Fortunately I had it wrapped in a plastic bag so the mess was kept to a minimum. Now I'm in the market for one with a higher quality bowl."
5,Yummie ice cream!,I always wanted an ice-cream maker and this was on sale so I purchased it. You need to keep it in the freezer for at least 24 hrs. I followed the directions very carefully and made some chocolate ice cream. This came out so very yummmmmy! Ice cream with half and half will come out softer. I also made the strawberry sorbet and after it was complete it had a very nice texture until I froze it and it turned rock hard. But if you stick your ice cream in the micro for about 15 secs then it is just fine. Make sure that you make you mixure ahead of time and put it in the fridge untill it is cold. My machine stopped at exactly 25 minutes and it was perfect.
5,YUM!,"My husband got this for me for Christmas 2002. Since then we have made well over 10 batches of ice cream. I doubt we will ever buy it from the store again. Provided that you follow directions on the ice cream maker itself, and also the recipe directions, you will come out with a rich, delicious treat every time. My favorites have been vanilla custard and cookies and cream. Our churning is usually done before 20 minutes is up. I highly reccomend this maker to everyone!"
1,Terrible Design,"I have had this ice cream maker for over a year now and I really wonder why I didn't return it. It's design is critically flawed in a number of ways...1) The motor is far underpowered. As soon as the ice cream or sorbet begins to freeze the motor cuts out before sufficient air is introduced.2) Once frozen, the bottom of the container swells just enough that you can't snap the lid and motor on. I actually cracked the top of mine trying to get the lid on--this is all before you add anything to the container.3) The hole that you pour the mix through once you start the motor is so small that if the mix is thick at all it is very difficult to get the stuff into the machine to freeze.I have probably tried a dozen or better recipes (some from their book and some other tried and true recipes). I have never gotten satisfactory results. This is really a badly designed machine."
2,Horrible,"I've tried 10 different ice cream (some straight from the book, others based on vanilla ice cream ) and none of the times did the ice cream come out in the right consistency. It was always too liquid and not stiff enough. When you butt it into the freezer it turn to froozen milk and cream. Not at all worth it."
1,Don't Buy,"I bought this unit thinking what a releif from having to purchase ice and rock salt and no mess. Well the mess is better. I froze the gel cylyder for 27 hrs, then run the machine for 40 minutes and the ice cream was only cold with a couple of ice crystals in it. I am taking this one back."
3,Motor not strong enough and paddle not well made,I just returned this ice cream maker to the store after doing 3 trials with it. I am not sure if my freezer is too cold or what but my ice cream turned to ice overnight. I have bought ice cream before and it never got hard. The sherbet was fine though so it may be the recipe.1- The 10 Watts motor is not strong enough in my opinion. Some competitors have 55 Watts motor and more. It smelled like the motor was going to fry at one point and the mixture was still quite liquid. This is the main reason why I returned it.2- I saw some other models since and the paddles should be redesigned to reach closer to the side of the bowl. It would prevent ice from forming all around the bowl.I am still searching for another model.
5,classic J5,"one of those songs that just takes you back and makes you feel good. the jackson 5 harmony was second to none and the king of music Michael Jackson knocked it out of the park. he stepped into that song. the music, production and the genius vocals timeless."
1,Waste of money,"They may be brighter and whiter than the standard bulb, but they don't last. Lost both within 6 months, with limited driving! These bulbs are tinted blue, and other reviewers noted they have to run a lot hotter to achieve the output. You pay for it with the short lifespan... Don't waste your money."
3,To big a waist for the slim guys.,Seem like nice pants but the small were way too small and the large fit good for length but the waist was huge. I gave up and didn't try the mediums.
5,A Nice Aussie Band,"Just got back from a four month trip to OZ. I got to hear a lot of new bands and stock up on CDs, which are nice and cheap down there. I was delighted to see that Australia has a much better good music to bad music ratio. They're not wallowing in crap as much as we are. The Superjesus was one of the best bands that I found. It'd be good to see them go big and make it up to the U.S."
4,"Decent follow-up to ""Sumo"" by Aussie band Superjesus","""Sumo"" and ""Sumo II"" with the extra goodies were great CD's, and ""Jet Age"" almost succeeds on the same level. Gone is Chris Tennant, guitarist and songwriter from the first record, and his input is sorely missed. But Sarah McLeod's vocals are still as strong as ever, and she delivers the new material well. It is tough to find good new rock bands anymore because of all the drivel that gets shoved down our throats and in our ears by the record labels and their BoyBands du jour. But Australia comes through for us again! Like what you hear with this band? Give a listen to Mourning Widow's CD ""Furnished Souls For Rent"", the new CD featuring Nuno Bettencourt, former Extreme axe-man (and husband of Suze DeMarchi, the former lead singer of Baby Animals -- perhaps the best rock band out of Australia in years!!)"
5,Great aussie rock from my teenage years,The superjesus were an aussie rock band in the late 90's early 2000's who were big here in Australia but never really made it overseas. I was totally into them and even saw them live once back in 1999 if i remember right. Anyway over the years i lost my original copies of their CDs so i started looking for them and for whatever reason the record company doesn't seem to keep them in stores anymore. So i was extremely happy to see this album for sale on amazon. It was shipped from Germany (i have no idea why) and was in excellent condition when it arrived. I'm glad i bought it and i'm loving playing it and reliving the memories.
3,Not as good as Sumo,"It is a shame this does not include the bonus live disc, as they sound so much better live. This album sounds too over produced and Sarah's vocals don't match that on Sumo. The song writing is not of the same high standard, but there are enough good songs on this record to make it worthwhile for any fan. Sarah is a rock chick through and through and it is a shame the band has now split up."
4,"Great case, but where do you attach the strap?","The TomTom 720 doesn't come with a case, but you should probably get one if you don't want to get it all scratched up taking it in and out of your car. After doing some research, the one xl was the best looking case I could find online. My cost was $44, which included tax and shipping. When it arrived, I wasn't disappointed: the one xl is made of a sturdy yet soft leather, fits the 720 like a glove, and has nice looking reverse stitching (for those in to aesthetics). The only complaint I have is that for the life of me, I can't figure out where to attach the wrist strap. There is no hole or hook on either the case or the 720 unit that I can find, and there are no instructions included with the unit. I'm either missing something totally obvious or this is a fairly substantial design flaw. Either way, it should be a lot easier to figure out (it's a wrist strap for crying out loud) so I docked the case a full star in my review."
1,Don't buy this style of carrying case!,"Bought the case, thought it was great - lightweight, convenient, etc. Then the TomTom (while in the case) fell onto the floor and landed on the screen side, which is the same side where the case closes with a button. When the TomTom landed on the floor the button on the case struck the LCD screen, smashing it. This is not covered by the warranty, either by manufacturer or by the store where we purchased it, so we're out over $200 beause of the design of the case!"
4,good with reasonable cost,"I needed this case to protect my TomTom's screen from being scratched and it is doing the job so far. I am also caution with the magnet button becasue the device ""MIGHT"" slip out of the case due to its weight. Therefore, I always hold both the case and the strap together."
2,I never got it!,"Never arrived! I got a refund. Out of stock maybe. I chose a nicer bag from Best Buy (take your GPS to the store with you if you want a tight fit) which will also hold all the related bits and pieces, manual, chargers, etc. Got a camera bag."
5,A Must Read!,"Fr. Abesamis--as one who has lived and worked with the poor in the Philippines--offers his construction of Jesus that does not look anything like the blue-eyed blond, liberal Jesus that most contemporary researchers' works portray. Through nineteen chapters (which he calls ""stop-overs"", the work being a ""journey""), he ""travels"" through Jesus' life, death, resurrection, and promise of return. But he does not take this journey alone. He walks with companions: fisherfolk, laborers at the picketlines, mothers, daughters, farmers, the common Tao (human being)."
2,An ok attempt at a great anime...,"this dvd is an attempt to bring this great anime to a younger audience with less than steller results. If your looking for an anime for young children, then I would recommend this to you, but if your a fan of Megaman EXE/Rockman EXE and are looking for a great anime, then you'll want to go with the Rockman EXE anime."
3,Things you need to know...,"This is the first episode of Megaman NT. It has four episodes, two languages of English and Spanish (no subtitles), and it is dubed, which means it does not have the original Japanses language and subtitles."
1,My thoughts,I loved the action scenes when I watched them on Kids WB however I am somewhat unhappy that the Dvd releases will be in edited format only since I would really love to see the original uncut material. I Just wish they would allow for some way to make it easier for me to watch. PS. I really don't like Animes where for any Reason that have been butchered more they need to be.
5,Megaman is a great anime!!!,Megaman NT Warrior is the best anime that I have ever seen!! It is full of action pack scenes and adventure!! I recommend all Megaman fans to buy this DVD and the other volumes that will follow it!!
4,It's a cute movie!,It's a good story & uplifting as well! I like the idea of good winning over evil.I also enjoy the romance part of the movie.
5,Best movie EVER!,I reiterate - the BEST MOVIE EVER!! Although I rarely have it in my possession because someone has borrowed it!
4,See below,"I was looking for the 4th or 5th of , either Family or Charms. It will have given the DVD to a friend who enjoys this kind of movie, so it will not be waisted. I hope you will have the 4th or 5th of this series soon since I have the other three, and my family enjoys these movies."
5,Great Movie,I watched it on TV and loved it so much I had to own it. I hope they come out with the sequels.
3,Sweet movie with some REALLY bad acting,"This movie is sweet and is pretty much the standard small town romance, with some magic thrown in. However there is some HORRIFIC acting in it which kinda puts a damper on the whole thing. The kids acting is mediocre at times (which is understandable and can be overlooked), but the acting of the character or Martha (the mayor's wife) is beyond awful. She is ridiculously bad (almost laughable in her portrayal of a small minded housewife on a power trip) and I have no idea how this actress landed any kind of role in a televised production. The scenes without here are decent and the basic story is good. But the bad acting of Martha ruines the rest of the movie. I'm tempted to see the sequels, but not without first seeing if the actress who plays the mayor's wife is not in them. If so I think I'll pass."
2,Was Not Movie Indicated,"Although I tried to cancel this purchase, there seemed to be no avenue....until here.The problem was not the movie....I liked the series. I had already seen the first 2 Witches, and wanted to see the most recent one.....The Good Witch, Family.....which is what the title said.When I began watching, I realized it was not the Most Recent (The Good Witch, Family), but the original movie."
2,Quite boring,"I decided to watch this movie after seeing its amazingly high rating on amazon....sad to say i was severely disappointed. I had to make quite an effort to sit through the whole movie while staying focused on it because it was so incredibly boring and i felt my intelligence was being insulted at times. This movie utterly lacks wit, adventure, excitement and creativity. However, its not terrible and i understand how it may be pleasing enough for some."
2,Boring...Trite...Cliche...We've seen it all before,"This could have been an adorable movie, but it was so full of the trite elements of movies of the past. The nosy mayor's wife, the sweet widower, the bully, the uninformed and easily manipulated townsfolk. I should have stopped watching when the dog owner was going to press charges for the witch ""ruining his dog"" because she talked to it, but I made it another 20-30 minutes before I couldn't take it any more. It was just absurd and beyond stupid. So sad I paid $2.99 to watch this online. I couldn't make it through once, let alone enough times to get my money's worth."
1,Teaching Values,"Other than the usual small town cookie cutter stereotypes and the usual single dad loses wife and upset kids lose mom (as usual, mom sub is'a comin') and other redundant community interpersonal conflicts I would say that if parents need a made-for-tv movie to teach values they are in a whole world of hurt. Everything in this movie from the lack of anything dirty (like in dirt) to it's syrupy whiteness does nothing but teach an avoidance of all the issues that are devastatingly real to the rest of the world. To build on our fantasies a, not clear why or where she comes from, witch shows up to magically make our problems go away. No wonder we can't solve problems - we keep waiting for good witches."
5,The good witch,The Good witch was such a good movie. I wanted to buy it. Im disappointed that it has be discontinued. This is a movie that the whole family could watch together. It has good morals and lessens.
5,"The Good Witch, 4x3, not 16x9?","I love ""The Good Witch"" & its 4 sequels. I saw it in 4x3 format, & see that this DVD is also in 4x3. I have seen the 4 sequels in 16x9 from Hallmark HD channel. I wonder if ""The Good Witch"" was made in 16x9. Besides being portrayed by a beautiful & charming actress, Catharine Bell, the character of Cassie Nightingale has a subtle magic (subtler than ""Bewitched"" or ""Harry Potter) based on strong intuition, sensitivity to others's needs & a psychological gift for ministering to the needs of the other. Cassie is also a person who brings out the best in others by seeing beyond appearances & patiently expecting a person's better nature to emerge."
5,Great,My dad loves all these movies about the good witch from the Hallmark channel. I'm hoping they release the rest of these movies too so I can get them for him.
5,The Good Witches Garden,When will you be releasing the second movie of The Good Witch.. The Good Witch's Garden. I love all the movies and now They are showing the Gooh Witch's Gift I would love to have these on DVD. Please let me know if they will be released.
5,Are you a Good Witch?,"I have been waiting for this movie to become available for a long time. I was so glad to see that it was finally available. If you like movies that can show the magic of everyday life and common sense, then this is the movie for you."
5,Good Clean Movie,"They need to bring all of the Good Witch movies out!!! We are waiting desperately for them, please listen to your audience"
5,Can't wait to own all three movies.,"Oh my goodness, I love this movie and was so excited to see when they came out with a second one. Then at Christmas time 2010 when i saw they came out with a third one I was so excited. They are a wonderful movie that can be watched over and over."
5,would like to buy,"I have watched the Good Witch movie with Catherine Bell, and the Good Witches Garden. I really would like to buy them, actually both of these movies. I can't believe that they quit production before it ever went to TV. this is a shame. It's a shame that a good set of movies like these are not available."
5,Good Witch,My wife loves the movie and would like to find the whole trilogy of the Good Witch but has been unable to find them on Amazon
5,The Best Movie Series Hallmark has ever Made,This Movie has enchanted my senses ever since I first saw it on Hallmark Channel - I only hope the 2nd and 3rd in the series will be released on DVD soon!!
5,The Power of Believing,"When I saw ""The Good Witch"" for the first time I could not believe how it had impacted me. It has become so powerful in my life and for what I also believe in.....LIFE, BELIEVE. Believe in yourself, others and in life.Now I am looking for the 2nd part and unfortunately cannot find it...""The Good Witch's Garden"". Can anyone help me with where I can purchase this one?I speak at certain venues about believing in oneself and in life and in others as I also speak about myself and disclose a time where believing was not even in my vocabulary. I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND RECOMMEND IT VERY MUCH !Anthony J Raiola[...]"
4,When Will the Rest be Available?,"It's fun to watch a movie that involves the supernatural to some degree, but features almost no special effects. It's quite obvious that this movie was made with a limited budget, but it was extremely well-written and acted. Most importantly, not once is it ever implied that the titular character has any actual powers--merely that she is most likely an incredibly insightful person.Kids and adults will enjoy this. And you should suggest that the 3 sequels also be made available. The Hallmark channel definitely scored a winner with this series"
1,Cute but didn't fit,"This is a clever and cute item. It is well made, but it didn't fit the car's antenna, which was the usual metal one. I knew it wasn't going to fit on my car which is a short, thick, plastic-coated antenna on the roof.This was going to be a gift. Not sure what antenna it was made to fit on."
3,not great but okay,i should have stopped at Matisyahu & Ta-shma. this guy is okay i guess but i wasnt too impressed. i'll probably end up giving this one away.
4,"fat, not phat","This is a good pocket watch, what would be expected from a Swiss Army watch. Very heavy with a solid feel. Only two detractions: first and foremost is that this watch is very fat, the back is not shown in the images but the back has a panel that extends out slightly, total thickness is just over 1/2 an inch. Second: the leather pouch is not made for this thick of a watch, the watch must be pushed in and pulled out."
5,Durable Watch,"Great watch, very durable and if you are an electrician working around live parts you will want a watch that is kept in your pocket."
2,Tricky to read,"Because this watch is angled sideways, I found I was always reading it wrong, expecting the 12 to be where the 10.5 is, and expecting 3 where the 2 is. Making the watch at this angle is a clever concept, but it's tough to change a lifetime of habit."
3,Too small,"This watch is really quite small. I have to use the second to last hole on the band and I am not a large woman. If I use to last hole, the band isn't flush. To return the watch I will have to pay a $10 restocking fee as well as a shipping fee. I haven't decided if I'm going to keep it yet.Also the color is not what we expected. Overall I am a little disappointed."
4,Hot Alex,"I am collecting as much as possible of Alex O'Loughlin. But this dvd really is quite good, as far as stories. It's a shame that the season was not complete because there were several story lines not finished. Also check out Moonlight, another unfinished tv show but really good. At least now he has a hit with 50."
4,ethical dilemma,"This was a compelling, if somewhat disturbing, episode. Mandy Patinkin gives an outstanding performance as an ALS patient facing life on a ventilator, who wants to be taken off life support so that he can be a heart donor for Andy's patient Kuol, whom he has befriended. Faced with a diminishing quality of life, he wants to make his death count. But to the doctors, especially Andy, it feels as if they are allowing one patient to commit suicide to benefit another. In a subplot, Dr. Lee treats a young man who is the guardian of his younger siblings, and is reluctant to go on the transplant list because he fears the authorities will break up his family if they know how sick he is. Is it ok for a 60 year old in a wheelchair to allow himself to die to save another, but not a 20 year old? Watch it with your family; it could provoke some interesting discussions."
3,Should have been better,"Three Rivers never reached its potential for being an entertaining show. The writing wasn't that good and it didn't give the main characters enough personality that we could know them and understand them. The writers wasted the talents of Alex O'Loughlin, Kate Moenning and Alfre Woodard. There were too many elements needed for each show: The dying, the donating and the receiving of organs, that it lacked time for anything else. It's too bad, because the subject matter could be very educational, inspiring and uplifting. The first few episodes came off like a Public Service Announcement for organ donations. It just wasn't entertaining enough, plain and simple."
3,No Closed Captioning,"I'm going to give it three stars because I LOVE LOVE LOVE this series and would give it five stars, but as a product, I would only give one star as it has NO CLOSED CAPTIONING. I cannot watch it because I can't hear it. I cannot believe a series this recent would not have closed captioning. I didn't sit down to watch it until the return window had passed so now I'm stuck with it. Am very disappointed. I had been looking forward to enjoying the series again, had waited until a time when I could watch it undisturbed - now, not only can I not watch it I can't return it. Boo."
4,great for kids.,all of the books in this series are great for kids... they are wonderful as incentives for doing good work if you are a teacher. the clorful stickers are pretty and simple enough that they don't overwhelm younger kids. a good choice.
2,hit and miss,"Some of the stories shone through (Alice Munro's was my favorite, the tom-boy bride and her refined friend), but overall i found this collection slightly disappointing. There was, in my opinion, too much focus on doubt, second-thoughts, and the ugly side of weddings (relatives, money, etc). That was not the case with all pieces, but the irony or the sadness carried over and took away some of the freshness."
1,Free to a good home....,"Of all the computer books I have purchased over the last few years, this one deserves special mention. Not only will it NOT prepare you for the MCSE exam, it's superficial coverage, miniscule screen shots, and poor organization have left me wondering what other use I can find for it (a hot dish coaster for my dining room table?). If someone can figure out what a 60+ page section on installing NT Server is doing in an IIS-4 study guide, please let me know. Even the included CBT CD can't rescue it from the realm of the totally useless. I consider this review a civic duty .. please, don't waste your money on this one."
1,Believe all the bad reviews!,"We used this book in my Networking Class in college and it offered not help what-so-ever. As some of the other reviews have stated, it is far to general and WILL NOT prepare you for the MCSE exam. The pictures are from another planet and the same ones are used over and over to describe different topics (hence confusing the reader). Definitely do not buy, unless you have to like I did."
1,Save your CASH !,"Don't go for this book. It will NOT prepare you for the 70-87 exam. This book is really a waste of money. Plus, it isn't worth wasting your time on it. YOU WILL NOT PASS THE 70-87 EXAM USING THIS BOOK."
2,Not as promised,"I'm in my 30's, light skin, everybody was talking about this product so i decided to give it a try; didn't work for me, after using it for a while I had break outs and my skin became greasy. It's not what they say it is, I've tried many philosophy products the only one that is what they promised is Amazing Grace for your body, but the skin care products are a scam, go for Neutrogena or clinique , good luck"
4,Great Product,"I think my skin looks better and I like the product, but the smell is a little hard to take. I have to hold my nose when applying it, but my friends think my skin ""glows"" now, so it's worth it!"
5,Fantastic Moisturizer,"I love this moisturizer. It is light in application, but works great. This is the only kind I now use."
2,not the best,"I tend to be very partial to sassy products, but this one was a real disappointment. I put them in the dishwasher (top rack basket), and the tips all bent/melted into very odd shapes. They are completely useless as feeding spoons, but have been great to chew while teething."
4,Really good,"I really like these spoons. My son is now two and has gone back to teething on them for his last set of molars, so you can see they have lasted a long time. There are a lot of good feeding spoons, but this has been the best teether ever. I always hand wash them, so I don't know if they melt."
1,"Bowl of spoon is oddly shaped, bad fit for baby.","I have a number of different brands of spoons including Munchkins and First Years. This is my least favorite. My husband and I only use them when they are the only clean ones left in the drawer! The somewhat deep, oval shaped bowl doesn't fit well in baby's mouth. Half of the food is left in the spoon. I recommend trying a different brand."
1,Two Sides to Every Coin,"The author, in spite of all his Leni-bashing, must be something of an admirer of the great filmmaker or he wouldn't have so passionately researched her life and career. Riefenstahl and her work have always, since WW2, generated a love/hate response from her audiences and this author makes his case for the latter. While there is nothing particularly enlightening about his findings or opinions, it is always interesting to read more about the fascinating century Ms. Riefenstahl has witness and affected with her art and strong personality."
3,Puntos de vista de un ex piloto de jets,Puntos de vista de un ex piloto de combateConsigue dar una excelente idea del mundo íntimo y profesional de los pilotos de combate de la marina y la fuerza aérea de los EEUU y de sus peripecias en combate. Cuesta ubicarse en la situación de guerra dentro de la cual entrega la vivencia de los pilotos.
2,A Christian in Denial about Freemasonry,"The author of this book more or less refuses to believe that Freemasonry has any origins that go farther back than the first officially established lodges in the 1700s and that they were never nothing more than a gentlemans social club for nice Christian men. He comes to this conclusion after using the book as a format to debunk Masonic (especially Albert Pike and Manley Hall) and anti-Masonic writers as well as various Masonic conspiracy theories. As mediocre as this book is I do agree with Morey on certain things. In particular Freemasonry has nothing to do with Druids or the Aryan Vedas, and Albert Pike was a total kook."
4,Tons of hints!,"You won't be disappointed if you purchase this strategy book. As always, there are lots of help hints, strategies, etc. My 9 year old even understands it and has been able to utilized it without any problems."
3,Kristen Scott Thomas as a vilain!!!,"As I always enjoy this actress'work, I decided to try this thriller. Story line is: boss lady uses assistant's work to promote herself higher in the corporate world. Once the other lady realizes she is being used, her attempt of pushing her own work behind her boss' back, is fought by nasty boss with humuliations and ridiculing her assistant to all management. Now the plot thickens with a vengeful plan that is quite contrive but makes the movie interesting. Moral is, eventhough it is lonely at the top, do not step on working ants as the Queen bee needs all her workers, at least that is what it seems."
2,Too formulaic--not a depiction of a true corporation,"The portrayal of an American company that allows these shenanigans to happen in a corporate environment is ridiculous. No one would allow the types of behavior displayed in this film between coworkers and promote an assistant in this situation to the level after returning.Unfortunately, it made this film difficult to watch. Character development was a thin patina of a deeply complex humans in a stressful, traumatic environment.Go Daniel!"
1,Don't waste your time!,"This movie is TERRIBLE. It's not even worth the $0.00 that I paid for it! The acting is atrocious (and I don't even speak French), the plot is predictable, and the cinematography is poor. This is basically a dressed up B-film."
4,"Travel to London,Nevada and the South Pacific.",This game kicks some serious butt. You take Lara Croft to hell and beyond. An ok story line and a lot like 2 and gold but still tons of devilish fun. The best weapon in this tomb raider are the uzi's!
2,The worst of the TR trilogy.,"To be fare, Eidos was trying to be innovative and original with it's levels and puzzles and that feature where you choose where to go next. But it seems to be at the cost of the story and level ideas. The graphics are no better than in TR2, the levels are too tedious, the levels have boring themes and the story is just pathetic. And worst of all is that in many levels you come across blurring where they seem to have missed out some of the graphics, which is plain careless. Other than that though. TR3 does have some interesting puzzles and additions which prevent it from being a 1 star game. Don't bother, I'd say. Get the first and second TR games instead."
4,One of the better TR.,"Tomb Raider 3, is very much like the others. The movement is the same, ect. But, I found this one to be one of the more enjoyable. Once again you are able to go to Lara's House, but there's more to do, and one could spend hours finding the secrets, and exploring it. Otherwise, though, I hasn't really changed, and while the plot is pretty linear, it's still a cool game."
2,Not made for NYC streets,Light plastic not made for the abuse needed to take from NYC parking conditions. My Cruiser Mounting Plate lasted one week b4 cracking at the thin mounting points. The plastic is too thin and brittle at the points of attachment to take an impact.
1,"Poor quality, doesn't last",This is a very poor quality mounting plate. Mine lasted just a few months before it started to crack and I ended up having to duct tape it to the bumper. After a year or so it broke away almost completely and I almost lost my front plate. I'm going to try theHelp 68148 Front License Plate Bracket. It's literally just a few dollars more and it's made of metal.
1,Almost lost my license plate,"I bought this bracket at a local parts store after finding that many of the parts stores around town only carried this one. Reluctantly, I bought it as a last resort since I needed it then and not later. I was worried that the plastic would break after some time. Low and behold, about two or three months later I come home to see my license plate hanging by one screw. I could have easily lost my plate on the interstate had I not noticed it before-hand. This would have easily run me a couple hundred dollars to replace. While it looks attractive, especially with a clear/tinted cover, it's not worth the hundreds of dollars in tag replacement fees. I do not recommend this tag bracket."
4,Seems Durable,"Anything plastic concerns me with durability. About all I can say is it fits, looks nice, and supports our license plate. I don't know if it could take much winter graveled road abuse but time will tell and the plate should absorb most of the shock. Works for now."
3,WORKS PERFECTLY FINE,"I've actually gone through two of these so far. The first one lasted for almost 2 years. Unfortunately, this doesn't hold up all that well on a contoured bumper with repeated impact (e.g. parallel parking in Los Angeles, etc.). With the right amount of force this can actually crack instantly.My suggestion to avoid this is to allow for a little give around the screws you'll use to mount this on the bumper. Doing so will allow for a little more flexibility during impacts. Conversely, if your bumper isn't contoured you're not worried about this.For the money, and at the rate of replacement I would say this is worth the purchase."
3,does the job,"Bought this for a Toyota Matrix, it does the job, but its a very thin plastic, watch when you wash your car, to much pressure will break it right off."
1,Stay Away,This toaster is awful! It does not toast evenly and makes a mess due to it's very award pop up mechanism. I would encourage you to look at the black and decker brand. I bought this toaster and I've already replaced it. Actually I'm a little suprised Target even sells it. I definately wouldn't recommend this toaster!
1,This toaster is toast,I have no one to blame but myself for putting up with this toaster for so long. Almost immediately I could use the toaster only on the lightest toast setting or it would burn the bread. Shortly after that problem one side stopped toasting altogether. We have now used the DeLonghi toaster for about a year with only one side working. It finally died in a heap leaving only a terrible electrical smell as it's final farewell. It's incredible to think this unit actually made it into the marketplace. Shame on me for putting up with it for so long.
1,Mechanical Difficulties and Burned Toast!,"I bought this toaster to replace a toaster oven. I assumed that it would be even better at simple toasting, so I was surprised to find that it took longer per cycle. After examining the heating elements, I could see that some where not even firing, resulting in uneven toasting. Even on the low setting, it over-toasted. In addition, larger items like bagels got stuck, even after trimming and using the pop up lever. It's going back."
2,"Takes too long, uneven toasting","Never really happy with this toaster, and now it just broke after a year of use, so good riddance. The good - it looks good and it was cheap. The bad - it was hard to get the handle to stay down, it had uneven heating due to elements not heating up in all areas, and the worst problem was the time to make a piece of toast. It took easily twice as long as any other toaster I've had, drove my crazy waiting for toast, especially if I was making multiple pieces for my family."
1,Doesnt work as soon as warantee ends,"The warantee ran out ,The toaster must have aself distruct mechanism .as soon as it runs out of warrantee. it dies."
5,Caribe best cd in the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This cd is amazing! I have never heard anything like itthe bonus dvd is great It has some fantastic songs like buleria and vive la vida and you should by it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,this is THE retro cd!!!,"I just picked up this cd and all I can say is WOW! Talk about a cd that delivers on what it promises - Rare & Remixed is what this delivers. Never before available on cd mixes from Erasure, The Cure, INXS, Book Of Love and more. Excellent purchase!!!Nice to see that not all labels have given up on giving the fans what they want. PLEASE make a Volume 2 :)"
5,Digitally Remastered From The Original Master Tapes!,"That's right! You won't find any vinyl hiss, pops, and clicks here! All tracks have been mastered from the original master tapes using the ""Aural Submission"" process @ Hi-Bias in Canada. The same holds true for the rest of the 'Retro:Active' volumes. Get all the volumes! Definitely worth getting for the sound alone."
3,Nothing New Here..,..if you're a fan of any of these bands then you've already got these remixes (or heard them at any 80's nite).
1,Still Not happy,"I ordered this product on 7/13, it was suppose to arrive by 8/4, it is now 8/25 and it has not yet arrived. I sent them a e-mail message inquiring about the late shipment, was informed it was lost in the mail, ya--right!!! Still not received a credit-nothing-will not order from this supplier in the future.G. JohnsonCalifornia"
3,15 minutes of oohs and aahs and finally good instructions,"This is an excellent video if the viewer can stand 15 minutes of back-patting. The step by step instructions and imagery make this a great instructional video. Sure wish they did some video magic to Harvey, the camera doesn't do his antiquity justice."
5,Long Lasting,"I purchased an Emerson microwave from another retailer in 1996.My microwave died in 2003!When it died, it did exactly the same thing as the other reviewers experienced.It would not heat anything. It made this scary crackling noise.I am happy with the performance. It lasted a long time and worked perfectly up until it died.I cannot remember how much money I paid for it. I am sure it was not very much. It was my first microwave, so probably under one hundred-dollars."
1,bad microwave,"I received this microwave at my bridal shower a year ago, and it has already stopped heating things. Do NOT buy this waste of money."
1,grrumph!!,"We bought this product less than 4 months ago. It looks nice, and is fairly easy to use, but: ONE month after we owned it, it started buzzing, humming, knocking, rattling, just plain being NOISY. The noise would come and go, but now it does it all the time!! The microwave still heats things relatively well (I think!), but the buzzing is ANNNOYING and just doesn't sound right for a BRAND NEW microwave! Of course, our receipt is long gone, and I don't know if it would've been return-able anyway, since we received it in exchange for another item and never got a new receipt. Don't waste your money on this Emerson microwave!"
3,Lasted forever - turned into a fire hazzard!,"I got my microwave in '96 and it just died on me last week (09/2012). It worked ok - used a lot by my kids over the years heating all kinds of things up. Was probably abused way more than it should have been (microwaving silverware, dry ramen noodles when the kids ""forgot"" to add water (do not try it stinks bad for DAYS), cd's when they wanted to see what would happen, other electronics, clothing, toys...) My oldest sons have started a number of things on fire in it...yet it continued to work. I think the final straw was the last spoon forgotten on a plate that ignited. Now, it doesn't matter what you attempt to cook, the bottom starts on fire. Kids run screaming around the house, and I'm lucky to have safely unplugged it and put out the fire TWICE! lol Apparently my 16 year old sons dont learn real fast...So that being said, I definitely feel I got my moneys worth out of it. I would probably buy it again if it wasn't so old and outdated at this point. :)"
1,horrible product!,"As one of the other reviewers wrote....you get what you pay for. We bought ours at Target 3 months ago and it completely died last night. The light comes on and the counter is ticking down, but there is absolutely no power coming on. Just the light inside. And of course my 90 day window was up 4 days ago, so now I can't even get a refund from Target! BOO to this product! We will never buy an Emerson product again! I only wish I had read these reviews before I purchased it!"
1,Worked great for 4 months,"This microwave is a piece of JUNK. It is now the largest paperweight we have in our home. I guess we could leave it plugged in for the clock. It lasted 4 months,a month too long to return to the store. My husband says he plans to install a large eye-bolt and it would make a great boat anchor."
2,Works well while it lasts,"After using this microwave, I intend to avoid Emerson products in the future. This microwave lasted less that one year. It suddenly shut off one day, I got it repaired; three days later it died again."
1,nothing great about it,this piece lasted only for 6 months. going to buy a better stuff than this one. i would not recommend this item for purchase.
2,suddenly toes up,"I bought my emerson microwave almost exactly two years ago now at target. up until recently it worked great, and I have taken good care of it, cleaning it inside and out on a regular basis--it still looks brand new. now all of a sudden it won't work. won't melt butter. won't heat tea. won't defrost anything! and if it does decide to work, afterward it makes this scary crackling noise deep inside of the case, so I just unplugged it; it seems to be unsafe. all of the microwaves my family or I have ever had (made by other companies) have always worked for years and years, so this has been rather surprising. I can't get this microwave serviced because the warranty is limited to one year and it would cost as much to get it fixed as it would to just get a new microwave. I give the microwave two stars instead of one because it worked so well for the two years i have had it. I didn't get my money's worth and am not planning on ever buying an emerson product again."
2,"The Power of Thor, inside your kitchen.","This is a good microwave with one major flaw: A little bacon grease got splattered on the plastic shield over the piece I will ignorantly call the ""Emitter"". What resulted was much burning and smoking and a phenomenon I can only describe as electricity arcing..as if I had angered Thor, the god of Thunder. It takes much scraping of a kitchen sponge to get the little burnt bits out, otherwise there's more fireworks. I am still using this microwave, because, I am a idiot and won't buy another one just quite yet. I'm waiting to take out half my apartment complex with my stupidity.Seriously, I'm buying Panasonic next time."
2,Short Lifespan,"We have owned this microwave less than 6 months and the SUPPOSEDLY heavy duty rotating plate snapped itself right down the middle for no apparent reason. NO warranty contact information was provided with the item - possible packaging mistake!?! Without it, you are not supposed to even use the oven. I will give it this, it does an OK job on SMALL items like veggies of oatmeal but manufacturing standards are now questionable."
4,so far so good,"i bought this microwave about a month ago and i've had no problems. i bought it because we had one just like it at work that worked great for the 3 1/2 years i worked there, and it was a resteraunt mind you, so it was used often.it also looks awesome black.not that is matters, but it's also very sturdy. i didnt have a step stool or chair unpacked when i first moved into my house, so the microwave was used as a step stool while i was cleaning my kitchen. :-)"
4,I Absolutely Love This!!!,"Absolutely loved this CD. I bought it because of 1 ""Hard-to-find"" song and was totally taken back when I listened to the whole CD, had forgotten just how good this group was...Rick"
4,I liked it .,"The Anthology is great. I don't mind that the songs are in mono and some are in stereo. As long as the quality of the sound does not suffer. Believe me Polygram has done an excellent job in remastering the Motown catalog. I have bought Motown cds before Polygram bought the catalog, and the sound was mediocre at best. Diana's vocals are crystal clear. The bass and treble of the songs are strong at both ends. You can really feel the bass.All the hits are included, though I felt the some songs were just filler to fill 2 CDs out."
5,musicfan,"Since the 1960's I have enjoyed the music of the Supremes and eventually became Diana Ross and the Supremes and remembering them on Ed Sullivan shows,hullabaloo, and other shows. I am very satisfied with the anthology and I will always be a Supremes fan"
3,"Good coverage, bad sound","I agree with the other reviewers here -- this 2-disk set has good coverage (I seem to remember buying it because it was the only anthology I could find at the time which included Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart) -- but the sound is pretty awful. I think during the remastering process someone decided to ""clean up"" the sound (with EQing, and maybe compression / limiting) which basically strips out the dirty-ness in the rhythm tracks that *made* these records (or maybe I'm just remembering the sound of vinyl)? The bass is almost inaudible sometimes. It sounds like it was made for people who are not really interested in music. If you want to listen to the Motown musicians, this is a disappointment. Is there a better (i.e. truer) CD version available?"
1,Buy somewhere else!,Amazon charged $8.70 for this item. Petsmart only charges $5.95! I found out this information after ordering from Amazon. I felt cheated.
5,Come Away My Beloved by Leon Coates,"I wrote the book, I am not the author, my Heavenly Father is.This book came about by sitting at the feet of Jesus andworshipping Him in intimacy. As He talked it was written downjust as He spoke it. If you like for Jesus to talk to you thenyou will love this book. What He tells you as an individual today, He will tell you something different for tomorrow.I have never read a book like this before. The Father saysthat the Bible is My written word but this is My spoken word."
4,A fascinating book about a fascinating man.,"A terrific book about a fine man, a great singer, and a great great guitar player. A must read for any true country music fan!"
4,a satisfactory read,"if you like hank snow you should enjoy this. its a good read but does not give anything away i wish he would have named a few names,but otherwise ok cheers"
4,A fascinating book about a fascinating man!,"Hank is known for being a good man, a great musician, and a terrific guitar player. This book is a must read for any true country music aficionado."
3,So so what ... C'est la vie.,I thought this movie was going to be interesting. Wrong ...It did arouse the curiousity of the other person watching.The director tried to take a hippy trippy view of this person's life.I found it disconcerting & didn't care what happened to her.I ended up leaving about halfway through to do the dishes.There was no English subtitles even though I speak French.
3,the ramblings of a self-important man.,"Whilst some of the descriptions and history of life in Africa, since forever, are evocative, I can't help disliking Paul Theroux intensely; for his arrogance that his confused thoughts and muddled links/hobby horses are interesting/true and his boring repetitions of how unique he is [we all are, pal and many have traveled like you],his constant name-dropping about his past connections - mostly with corrupt people, now in power in terrible regimes and...above all, his complete lack of compassion and disregard for anyone else on his profiteering journey; be it fellow travellers in dire situations or suffering natives. All that matters is Paul, and his constant re-iteration of how great he feels that no-one knows where he is is purely childish for a man with a family. A distasteful example of profit before self-knowledge."
5,Dark Star Safari,"After reading Theroux's observations about Africa from the 60's and current years, I better understand the harm that the foreign aid givers are doing to African's motivation to be self sufficient!"
4,land trip Cairo to Cape Town,Paul Theroux was in the peace corps as a teacher in the late 1960s in Africa so he has history and a relationship with the area of south central africa. Knowing some of the local language was also useful for this journey. It is terrifically interesting reading his insights into some of the changes and the evolution of the various countries through which he traveled.In hind sight I couldn't help but to reflect what he chose to edit out of this adventure? After you read Dark Star Safari you will understand my question.I recommend this read.
4,Excellent Reportage,"I've traveled a great deal in developing countries, but never been to Sub-Saharan Africa. I thought the book started out a little slugglishly, with the author meandering around Egypt and cruising down the Nile. I may have found this part the least interesting because it was the only country on his itinerary that I have visited -- or maybe becaue in Cairo Theroux is still in a ""civilized"" world. Anyway, by the time he was in the middle of Ethiopia, I was completely hooked, and remained so until the end. I found his encounters with aid workers particularly fascinating. This book shows how a travelogue by a keen-eyed observer can make a real political statement. In Theroux's case, he thinks many aid efforts may not be very effective."
4,nigelangelo,"For those who like travel, short bursts of history and touching human stories, this is a fantastic book. The author has the uncanny ability to mix humour and tragedy, despair with hope and absolute brutality with humanity. Some topics in this book should be painfully depressing but Mr Theroux manages to present these unpleasant facts in a tasteful manner. He also condemns the actions of corrupt,decaying countries but genuinely seems to like their people. I suppose that this is Mr Theroux's gift. He likes people and believes that if left on their own people will uplift themselves. I suppose that this love for humanity makes his books positive even though the topic my be negative."
4,"Brilliant Writing, but......","I'm not sure how to put into words my experience of this book and my experience of Mr. Theroux as an author. The other book of his that I enjoyed was ""The Kingdom by the Sea"". He is a spellbinding writer, even when his tone is...well, frankly, mocking, snide and caustic. He has a gift for seeing the underside of things and writing in a clever and engaging way about that underside. Is this book worth reading? Yes, incredible insight into places and people more exotic than we will ever visit. Another reviewer called him a ""misanthrope"". Oddly enough that exact word came to mind as I read this book. So that is my impression: Dark Star is a brilliantly crafted book written through jaded eyes; courageously honest, but exceedingly depressing; not only with regard to Africa, but for me, with regard to the heart of Mr. Theroux."
3,grumpy old man with occasional lighter moments,"By the time he is in Sudan, author was at the limits of his endurance. Travel through Africa is unpredictable and dangerous. It seems like author has not given up his western sensibilities, prior to embarking on such a trip. Those of us that have not dared and taste it secondhand, are deterred from ever embarking on such a journey. I am disappointed.Try The Shadow of the Sun by Ryszard Kapuscinski for a totally different taste."
2,Dark Star Safari Could have been Shorter.,"I found the book difficult reading and not that interesting. Towards the end, it almost became a rant against how awful Africa has become. We read it for a non-fiction book group. It might spark a good discussion, however, because of the way Theroux criticizes aid workers who arrogantly ride around in Land Rovers to the extend that he blames them for the decline of Africa in the last 30 years. He does not really make clear though why he thinks Feed the Children is not an organization one would want to donate money to."
1,I wouldn't.,"This book is absurd. Theroux manages to paint every local as either a whore, a cheater, a thief, or otherwise. He crams every single negative, racist stereotype you've ever heard about Africa and completely disregards its people, its rich history, and its beauty.Theroux seems to subscribe to the idea that Africa is a monolith, as his descriptions were much the same in every country he visited. This gem was my favourite: ""Even at their best, African cities seemed to me miserable improvised anthills..."" He captures misery rather well, but speaks little, if nothing about the urbanisation and booming economies scattered around Africa. He completely ignores that Africa as a continent is being siphoned by the remnants of colonisation and blames corruption solely on them. This book is a perfect example of a foreigner entering Africa with preconceived notions and thinking himself enlightened for visiting at all.Dark Star Safari has proven to be absolutely racist drivel. Don't spend your money."
2,"Funny, touching, cheerful, friendly star!","For an Anglo-Saxon traveller, this book carries authenticity. For the kind of traveller who rushes through a country in 2 days likewise. For the kind of person who is hooked on appearances, this book will carry conviction. It is, indeed, very well written. For someone like myself who grew up in Africa & speaks an African language like Swahili this book is a travesty; things are done differently here & if you don't like it, well, that's just too bad. It's your problem, not ours."
2,"Interesting topic, but much too negative","Theroux always chooses interesting topics to write about, and this book is no exception. But having read a number of his books, I always find myself disappointed, and I'm afraid that happened again here, too. Problem is, Theroux doesn't like people. So it's so depressing to hear him write an entire book on people! Listen to his assessment of a foreign aid worker, a young woman who had an outreach to the street children of a large African city: ""...this Christ-bitten nag and every other twaddler like her sought out Africans...to abuse them with the notion that thery were sinners, to browbeat them into arcane forms of atonement, such as screeching hymns and the dues-paying routine of tithes."" Is that the type of tone you want to hear through all 472 pages? I don't think anyone does. It certainly turned me off. Better look for a book from a person who seeks out the good in people and places and writes about that, not for someone who can't seem to stand people."
5,Theroux Gets Better and Better,"I've read every one of Paul Theroux's travel books since The Great Railway Bazaar started to change the face of travel writing. To me, they just got better and better over the years. I wouldn't have thought he could get better than his book about China, but this account of his journey through Africa is quite stunning. I didn't read it for a while, because of the length, and I wanted to be able to have some time to really get into it.His comments on revisiting places where he worked with the Peace Corps are really thought-provoking. Does aid actually work, in some countries? His descriptive powers are as sharp as ever, and you have to get to the end where there's a surprise in store. I'll say no more than that."
3,Not a repair manual,"The book provided a history of scooter development and the various brands available. However, I was looking for more of a technical book for upkeep and repair to go along with the one I already have."
2,not what I would say...,"After reading this book one could be mistaken that scooters were invented in America and that the cushman is a popular scooter known the world over. The influence of the japanese and others seems to be totally down graded to less than one paragraph. Any scooter buff worth his/ her weight would be offended at the american bias that this ""publication"" sprouts. Never have I been so annoyed at the total brainwashing that seems to be portrayed here. If this is what Americans need to make them feel better then I suppose it has some use. As for the title; everything you need to know.... what a lot of crock.Of course this is only my opinion... I suppose it is just as biased as many of the publications that think the vespa is the only scooter, It would have been nice to read information that I could use. Oh well, back to the bookstore.:("
5,"""Quite possibly, it is the best scootering book of all time""","Just when I thought nothing could top the Dregni's earlier book (Illustrated MotorScooter Buyer's Guide), they have come up with another masterpiece with their new book Scooters! In Scooters! the authors trace the history and development of the scooter and make an ambitious attempt to show the effect of the scooter on society and popular culture. The book boldy attempts a full tour de force of the wonderful world of scooters and scootering.... Visually, the book is dazzling. Drawing from archival photos, advertisements, and brochures, many long forgotten or unknown images appear for the first time. Like the text, the photographs are often whimsical and attempt to cover the full panorama of scootering....If you are looking for a book to introduce a friend to the joys and romance of scootering, this is definitely the book. Quite possible, it is the best scootering book of all time. --John Gerber, American Scooterist magazine, Autumn 1996"
1,One screw is gone ...,One screw is gone ... amazon did not help me to replace it. Therefore the Key Ring is not operational. The screws are very problematic .
3,Just ok...,"I love Titanium. I think its one of the best materials out there. Its as strong as steel, yet half the weight. I have titanium watches, bracelets, chains, and rings. Compared to those items this just seems, ehh...Finish is dull, caps will come unscrewed if you dont tighten them has much as possible (and check periodically for changes), and the size doesnt accomidate as many keys as I thought it would. I only have 8 keys on it but with the caps (approx. 1/4"" long each) it seems a little cramped. It's feasible and I only paid $14.40 because of ""Friday Sale"" so I probably wont return it."
2,Titanium Key Ring,Very small and not really worth the money. The screw on end becomes loose easily and comes off and the keys fall off. I ended up losing it all together.
3,okay product,The product is good looking but the two edges of the keychain screw on and off too easily. I just purchased the product a couple of weeks ago and one of the ends keeps unscrewing on its own and I have almost lost the screws numerous times. I think I might just toss the expensive product because I am afriad it will cause me to lose my keys. I would not recommend the product.
4,No problem at all,"I like it. Thanks for other reviewer who lost the cap, I kept the end caps very tie."
3,removes the actual color,it is very strong. i bough it remove color stains from my hubby's t-shirt. but after using this it lost its actual color.
2,"Just ""OK""","I have had this product for quite a while now. In the beginning it seemed to work well but as time as gone by (about 2 years) it just doesn't seem to have suction anymore. Honestly, I think it is the cleaning solution that makes this thing ""work"". It tends to ""spit"" a lot. I take it apart to sanitize it after each use and I have to say that this is a difficult thing to put back together (and I am pretty okay with that kind of stuff).I would not recommend this to someone that will become easily frustated. When a stain happens there is usually some stress involved, right? You really want to be able to grab the spot lifter and take care of it right away. Better to practice a few times before ""showtime"". There is a learning curve to this one.WARNING: this is so loud that it makes my ears ring when I am done using it. I dread having to use it simply because of the noise."
1,Doesn't do the job,"Really not satisfied with this product. It doesn't hold much water, doesn't have enough suction and really doesn't ""clean"". I need a spot scrubber that GETS RID OF THE SPOT! This doesn't do it. Mine sits in the closet."
4,Adequate little gadget,"Have had this number for 3-4 years now. Works fine for lifting spots and stains. It still requires a lot of elbow grease to scrub out spots, and cleaning the unit is more work than cleaning the carpet. Certainly adequate for small messes, doesn't claim to be anything more.I'd be interested to see what the next generation looks like."
5,Its a Time saver!!!,"I received this for a birthday present and Its the BEST! I have 1 Dog, 1 cat, 4 rats, a 10 year old, and a hubby that works on cars on his days off. Its removed mud, grease, oil, cat stains,rat stains and paw prints on my tan carpet. It removed stains on an old couch, and a stain that was here when we moved in. That stain has been worked on by a professional carpet cleaner! I love this thing, My only complaint would be the cleaning solution compartment is too small, BUT as a fellow reveiwer mentioned, a spray bottle works great! I love this product"
1,Something lacking,"All of my cleaning tools are DIRT DEVIL products. I can't say enough good things about them,however this appliance FAILS big time. I purchased it at Walmart for $34.99. I had read many of the reviews on Amazon.com and decided to give it a try. I wanted a tool that I could use for small clean ups, and to get into areas where my Phantom Force can't reach and instead of hauling out my Dirt Devil Phantom Force Carpet Extractor to do spot cleaning. The bristles on the rotating brush are very soft and flatten out when trying to clean, holding the machine during operation is difficult due to it's weight and awkward shape. Removing the tanks is not as smooth as it should be and you have to remove two screws before you can remove the part that the water is sucked up when you want to clean it. This machine would work better with a roller type brush with firmer bristles. If I thouhgt I could return it for a full refund I would."
5,"Try it, you'll like it!","When I purchased this item I never thought it would get much use, but having two dogs...a puppy and a very senior citizen...I have used this appliance at least five times already and I am extremely pleased with its performance. It is exceptional for small areas..and it has cleaned up some pretty hefty stains. It is easy to use and definitely worth the cost. I recommend it highly."
1,why is this on the market?,"I bought this machine because I thought it would be easier to use than my big Hoover. Boy was I wrong! It has no suction power, stains stay where they are, nothing gets done. A big waste of money. Save yourself the time and buy a big machine that works. Hoover is a great cleaner."
1,Very Dissatisfied,"I purchased this product because of the reputation of Dirt Devil products. I tried cleaning stains from my couch and there is absolutely no difference. It will semi-clean stains on the carpet if the stain is very new and still wet and I scrub for 5-10 minutes, otherwise the stain is there to stay."
5,SPOT scrubber YES!!!!!!!!,"This is a great product as a spot scrubber. It does exactly what is supposed to do. The other people who reviewed this and said the vacuum suction is too small are not understanding that this is a vacuum for small WET messes. If the suction section were larger, it couldn't pick up the liquid. No where does this product advertise as a ""Wet/Dry Vac"". It isn't built for that. Don't expect it to do what it isn't built to do. It is a ""Spot Scrubber"".As far as the machine, it is great. We have cats. They do unspeakable things to the carpet. This machine helps me get rid of the messes they make. Yes, the spray part is manual, but what do you want for $30?This scrubber scrubs messes and the vacuum suctions up the liquid.It is louder than a regular vacuum cleaner, but it is doing extra work."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money ! ! !,This thing is a complete piece of junk! I don't know how this thing could possibly get one single good review. Do yourself a favor and read through the reviews and see just how many displeased customers there has been. It's extremely weak...has hardly any suction...brushes are too soft and rotate slowly....you have to manually spray water out to the spot & then use this heavy thing like it's an oversized scrub brush. I could work circles around somebody using one of these by me just using good ol' elbow grease and some cleaner. Get something else!!!
3,Works great on flat surfaces,"Flat surfaces, that you don't need to twist around raised surfaces. Brushes too soft. What is with these companies and the soft brushes, Every household gizmo are too soft in the brush. At least the scrub and vacuum was seperate from each other with a switch."
2,Waste of Money,"I couldn't agree more with the reviewer from Meriden,CT. I bought the Dirt Devil to clean up small spills on my carpet, but this vac only made them worse. The rotating scrubber brush serves only to spread out the stain, and it had absolutely no suction power so your carpet stays dirty and wet. I agree that even a little bit of lint clogs up the tiny opening for the suction, and taking the machine apart for cleaning is a big hassle. Stay away!"
2,not worth it,"i bought this thinking i could clean up the nice mess my older dog left for me this morning. not only did i waste my money, but my time as well. it cleaned up the spots somewhat, but nothing i couldn't have done with a little elbow grease. it's going back."
1,Waste of money!,"I bought this on sale for about $50 about a year and a half ago...it is absolutely useless. Its description and marketing is very misleading. I thought that I was purchasing a mini carpet cleaner. It does not clean...it's basically a hand held vac with a spout for spraying water. You might as well get some cleaner, a spray bottle, and a sponge to clean up spots! Or invest in a nice full size carpet cleaner."
2,personal usage,"Brush too soft, but the switch between vac or scrub was a goood idea. Cleans only flat surfaces, hard to use on cars floor area, no room to manuever."
1,Terrible product,"I bought one of these thinking it would do the job for a pet ""accident"" or little spills. Terrible, it doesn't have any suction to speak of, I sure wouldn't call it a scrubber! I kept going over the same spot and it didn't do much except make it wet. I finally threw this out after trying it on a few different spills. Waste of money."
1,CRAPPY WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME,"junk! thats all i have to say after using this thing. it dosent hold very much cleaning solution, and the unit is extremely noisy. it couldnt even scrub a little dried dirt from my carpet. the brush is soft like a baby brush, so its not getting any serious scrubbing done. and the vaccumm is not powerful at all. the dirty water tank dosent even fill up because it cant suck up any water. and cleaning this thing was a nightmare. dont waste ur time."
1,Loud and Leaky,"This unit is extremely loud, not very powerful and leaks. Also blowsdirty water out of the exhaust vents, making for more of a mess than itcleans up. It has been tossed."
1,Terrible---Waste of Money,"I purchased this spot scrubber because we had a new puppy in the house. Let me tell you---I was changing the dirty water tank more often than I was cleaning up after the dog! It needs changed at least once after every use, if not two or three times. In regards to cleaning up pet messes---don't even bother, unless you want to have dirty pet messes flying out at you from the side of the tank. It is a pain to clean the dirty tank out and even more of a pain to clean the suction tube where things can get stuck. If I could do it all over again, I would have definetly purchased anything but the Dirt Devil Spot Scrubber."
1,no stars,"While the budget price might make this product attractive, it is almost completly worthless. The brush that spins has no power behind it and the suction from the vacuum is not very strong either. I succeeded in doing nothing more than pushing stains around which I still had to treat with Resolve and blot up"
4,good for pet stains,PRO: Really does scrub out pet stains with ease -- Easy to useCON: Suction could be better for extracting cleaner -- Would not be good for doing big areas
1,Don't bother with this product,"I just bought this product because :1. It was cheap2. I thought it would be convenient.Well, even if it were free, I wouldn't use it. I'm returning it right away.This cleaner is really poorly designed. You have to remove the tank on the top of the cleaner to add the cleaning solution and water. Once the tank is full and heavy,it is very difficult to line up the tabs to get the solution tank back on. The button for the spray nozzle is poorly placed, and not comfortable to use. The unit is noisy, and worst of all the suction is very weak. This leaves you with a very wet carpet. It takes longer for the carpet to dry after cleaning. Not worth it, no matter how cheap."
1,Not worth it!!,"I bought this product in hopes I could save 200 dollars by not buying a full size cleaner to clean small spills! It does not clean carpets! I have used it to suck up spills right after they happen before I pull out my NEW full size. It sucks great, but you have to push and pull it, the cleaner trigger--you have to continuely spray it and it comes out slow.The product works, but is not worth the price nor the time it tkes to clean up a mess. This will not take the place of an upright clean or any other scrubber, your bristle brush and spray cleaner would be much easier!Goodluck!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Complete waste of money. You can do the same thing with a spray bottle of cleaner and some elbow grease, while avoiding the horrible noise. My car is quiter than this contraption. It has very little suction and is not remotely like a steam cleaner. Your carpet will be left with a residue as the solution is not cleaned through or out from the carpet. I don't know why is has a water tank, as the only wet on my carpet came from spraying the solution. I promptly returned mine for a refund and invested in a upright steam cleaner, which does the job."
2,forget it!,"I returned the item the next day I bought it, it did very little for the soil stain on the carpet, in fact, it made a bigger mess, the water is evry where BUt the stain it selef. The vac doesnt have enough power to pick up the excess water. Who cn blame them, this only cost 40 buck..."
3,Dirt Devil spot scrubber,"I have bought this brand before but this little unit is somewhat disappointing. First, it is heavy. It is noisy. The suction is weak. It is a little complicated to clean. The little screws have to be removed to clean the suction apparatus and then replaced. I kept loosing the screws in the unit. The sprayer only squirts a small amount of cleaner at a time. Needless to say, fair product but I am sure there are better. I'm hoping target will take it back. I got it for Christmas and my sister can't find the receipt!"
1,Don't waste your money......,"I received this as a gift, and have had it serviced 3 times throughout the original warranty, and another 2 times throughout the additional 1 year service warranty I bought.And the funny thing is, I have only attempted to use it on 3 spots!Thank God I didn't waste my OWN money!"
1,POOR,This product is horrible. I attempted to use this for spot cleaning on a couch and futon mattress. The spray nozzle is manual (not too bad) but the suction was less than adequate.
1,dirt devil scrubber,this scrubber is way too hard to use for what you want it for.i wanted it to sopt clean the couch and it does not pick up the water. i hate it and i am returning it tomorrow.
1,This machine stinks!!!!,"I recently purchased this scrubber for a present, however, liking the idea kept it for myself. After using it one time, I returned it to the store. I am purchasing something different for the gift. I am glad that I tried it before giving one to my grandma. A big waste of money. Don't even bother."
2,On my way to return this,"I bought this item yesterday and tried it on the carpet in my van and after 45 minutes, it looks the same. There just is not enough power. I came in the house and tried it on some dirty paw spots on my oatmeal colored carpet and I can still see them. Now, they are just wet paw spots. Bypass this item."
1,Horrible,"I received this as a bridal shower gift, and was so excited because I thought it would help to pick up pet stains. It did no such thing. It left a good wet spot, and didn't pick up even the spray form the machine itself! I have tried on several different stains and spills in the carpet, and it really picked up nothing. What a waste of money. Spend your money on a good scrub brush, carpet cleaner, paper towels and elbow grease!!"
3,Cleans well but not very well made,"This is very convenient for small spills, vomit, or urine spots. It cleans as well as our large Hoover upright steam cleaner. However, we have had this only about 6 months and the plastic is cracked and one large piece is missing. No one remembers dropping it or anything so it is apparently quite fragile. Also, when vacuuming up liquid from a spill, sometimes the dirty liquid sprays out the air vent on the side even when the tank is almost empty. That is pretty gross, but since it is so cheap and works well, I would recommend it ... just consider it to be a yearly purchase."
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this when I moved into my apartment and had my grandchildren around alot. Most of the time, the spray button sticks, so I can't spray solution on the spot to be cleaned. Then the brushes would stop rotating if I pushed down on the carpet. I always clean the dirty water tank after using (even if it is only one small spot) because it will stink up the apartment if I don't.I have finally given up and gone to a large carpet cleaner, scrub brush and a bottle of Fantasik to clean up the spots left by leaking juice cups and lunches. Takes less time and energy."
3,It was Okay,"I bought the spot scrubber because of all the five star reviews it recieved, but I was a little disappointed. It does get the spots up, but I don't think it really does a better job than a spray cleaner, scrub brush and towel. You can also only use the product for horizontal use only. For a big wet mess I suggest a shop vac to suck up the liquid. I wish I had saved my money for the regular large type carpet cleaner."
2,Almost useless,"This product doesn't work very well at all. It's EXTREMELY loud, and the two spinning scrubbers do nothing in the way of cleaning.The suction doesn't pick up very much, as the opening where the liquid is supposed to be picked up is extremely narrow. The resevoir where the cleaning solution is put is too small. All in all I was very disappointed with this product."
4,Remember what it's supposed to do...,"I had read some reviews of people not being happy because they couldn't clean their carpets with it. It's meant to be a spot cleaner, and I think it does a great job. I use a capful of the Bissell cleaner from my large steamer, and I haven't had a problem. I have a cat, and I'm constantly cleaning up small spots. It's too much trouble to get out my large unit, so I purchased this. I love it. Just remember that this is a spot cleaner, and don't try to clean large areas with it. Also, don't be afraid to press down to get the best suction and brush action. I would definitely recommend this for people with cats with hairball problems."
4,"Mostly Plusses, One Big Minus","This steamer is much more powerful than a similar Bissel model I bought about two years ago. With it being cord powered, it's much more useful than the rechargeable ones that you juice up for several hours to run for 2-3 minutes tops. It really works extremely well, but I'd like to get a hold of whoever designed the small collection tank which only holds maybe 2-3 cups of water and when full will spew the dirty floor water contents out both vents which sprayed me in the face the first time when I was trying to figure out how to use it and will spray all over the place...."
2,Really doesn't do well.,"I have 4 cats and 3 dogs, but my biggest problem is a Great Dane with a stomach problem. Every now and then she spits up a large amount of yellow slime that really stains the carpet. I have used 1/2 a can of spot shot and still had a yellow spot. I tried this cleaner, and it did nothing for the stain. I have a large carpet cleaner that will remove the stain, but it's a pain to pull it out every time I have a spot to clean. I finally tried the Little Green Clean Machine, and it did the trick. The stains come out and the carpet is left almost dry. I think the problems with the Dirt Devil are that the brushes are too soft and the suction is not strong enough."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this awhile ago and it does okay on the suction I thought. I thought it sprayed well and sucked well but stain removing? Nope. This is gross (sorry) but my son was ill and vomited all over the carpet. I cleaned up the vomit and then used the spot scrubber. It didn't help at all.I tried the spot scrubber three times (after letting the carpet dry each time). Still nothing, didn't remove the stains at all (or the stink). My husband steam cleaned the carpet with our REAL steam cleaner and the stains came out (and the stench).Try another machine and read the reviews, they have never steered us wrong. This was an impluse purchase at a store."
1,Practically useless,I had high hopes for this device. CONS: Had little suction; It's extremely noisy; Have to push hard to get the solution to come out; Handle in the front and most of the weight in the back makes my wrists hurt after only a few seconds. PROS: Can't think of any. I guess it makes so much noise that people naturally think it must be doing something.
1,This thing sucks and not in a good way,I purchased this vacuum because of the glowing reviews on this site. I must say that I am very unhappy with my choice. The thing has no suction power at all and forget about the useless spray that comes with the machine. What little liquid it does suck up then comes spraying out of the vents on the sides.I was going to donate this to the local used merchandise store but I don't want anyone else to waste their time and money on it. I'm putting this in the trash today!
2,Think twice - do you really need it?,"The machine does it`s job but I never use it. You can`t clean really large area with it, and for the small spillages and stains it is much easier just to sprinkle over some good chemical and wipe out with a cloth. Just think - you unwind the cord, fill the tank, clean, suck, clean the tank, curse the stupid lock between the tank and the trunk, wind the cord... Oh, no, man!I think that I just waisted my money."
1,Piece of garbage!!!,"I've tried it on several stains on the carpet and it hardly did anything. Not only that, but the unit is so loud, my ears were ringing after using this machine. As poor job this unit does, I can do the job a whole lot faster and more effective with a pack of them Mr. Clean Eraser sponges. We're taking this unit back ASAP and getting an upright steam cleaner and certainly not a dirt devil."
1,BAD PRODUCT from a good manufacturer,"I was very displease with the suction on this. The scrubber did work well, but the cord is huge, it is loud and heavy. The manual pump for the spray was the pits! Once i got ready to suck up the stain, it all came out the air vents and sprayed me! NOT GOOD!! Towels suck up better!It was also hard to clean. I am returning it!!!I WILL BUY SOMETHING ELSE.Bad dog for dirt devil!"
1,Ineffective & difficult to use,"In the year I've had the Dirt Devil Spot Scrubber, I've never been able to clean much of anything on my short, berber-style carpet. My main gripe with the product is a little different than others cited here; if you look at the angled, circular scrubber itself, you can see that about 80% of it is recessed inside the casing. That means most of the scrubber never touches the carpet during operation. So a very small area of the scrubber actually scrubs the carpet, and even then, only the ends of the bristles reach it. In short, the unit has very little cleaning power, leaving it ineffective for short carpets or bigger spills."
1,Listen to all the unhappy buyers. Don't buy this,"If more than one person doesn't like this product then it's no longer a coincidence. I bought this for my cat stains. The first time I used it was was wonderful (it came with a sample sized manufacture cleaning agent). So I foolishly threw away the box and receipt. But as I used it the 2nd and 3rd time, I realized that this is the most disgusting cleaner I've ever seen. Hair gets stuck inside the steamer and I couldn't get it out. The scrubbing doesn't mean that it'll vaccum clean at the same time. It was a waste of money but luckily it doesn't cost much. Now it's just collecting dust in the garage HOPING that one day i'd figure out a better way to use it. I'm now back in the market for a hand-held steamer with 4 or 5 star ratings."
4,Good for little messes,"Pros: Scrubs as good as my steam cleaner, smaller, long cord, see-through tanks, easy to useCons: Loud, doesn't suck too well, not for sucking up ""chunky"" messesI bought it used at a second-hand store. Filled it with HOT water and Oxiclean. It says not to use anything but their brand, but I prefer Oxi. IT scrubbed out dried up doggy poo stains on a berber carpet and a plush carpet. Don't expect it to pick up much more than liquid. The vacuum intake is very narrow. It's good as stain remover though."
2,LIGHT DUTY ONLY,"Spend more and get somthing stronger. Good for quick pick up of fresh spills. Otherwise, assume 15 minutes of back and forth across a small area. Sprayer did not last long before it stopped springing back after a spray."
3,great for cars,"I bought this for small spills & stains and find that it does a decent job. I do really recommend it for use in cleaning the upholstry & carpet on cars. My daughter gets car sick fairly often & this product works well in removing stains & odor. I would like to see some attatchments made for getting in to crevices. The cleaner doesn't manuver extremely well in the small confines of a car, but still does a fairly good job at getting the majority of the surfaces clean. I'd definately recommend the ""Dirt Devil Spot Scrubber"" to people who want to spend the extra money to have a really clean car or to other parents of car sick kids. Otherwise I have a hard time justifing the price for the use."
2,Doesn't clean so well,"this machine looks real cute, but doesn't do such a great job cleaning. the bristles on the brush aren't very firm and they seem to push whatever you are really trying to clean, further into your carpet, leaving you to wonder if that spot is really clean or just brushed down further into the carpet. when packing up a donations box before moving, this is one thing that went in it."
1,Does Absolutely Nothing,"I tried it a few times and ended up throwing it away. I have medium-high carpet. The brush motion is very weak. The vacuum action is even weaker, it pulls almost none of the water and stain out of the carpet. I'd blot with a paper towel and soak several of them with the amount of water left in the carpet. It's far easier, faster, and more effective to clean carpet spots by hand."
1,Pretty useless,"Very small cleaning solution tank and dirty water resevoir. Makes cleaning a few square feet (< 4ft.) of carpet quite tedious. The instruction manual says that when the resevoir is full, the machine will shut off automatically. In reality, when the resevoir is full, dirty water shoots out of the vents."
1,Pass on this one,"There are tons of bad reviews on this product, so I'll spare you the details (LOUD and doesn't clean well). A little cleaning liquid and a scrub brush work about as well. Look elsewhere..."
5,Best Travel Pillow I've used,"This pillow works! Sleeping in the car used to make my son crankybecausehis head would painfully drop to his chest making him fuss & cry. Now with this comfy pillow, he naps peacefully & wakes up happy."
3,The dreaded nodding head of a sleeping child :o,We bought this in hopes of helping our children sleep while driving and not waking up in a bad mood or early because their neck was killing them. This is a hard task to tackle as you want to make sure they can breathe well and also be comfortable while still keeping their head into position without using a bungee strap.At first my son didnt want anything to do with it but he is growing on it. He has used it a few times and it could work better but I dont know how. Like I said this is a hard task to tackle. When he falls asleep sometimes it will slide forward. I think you could attach it to a seat belt but my son would flip out in claustrophobic rage if we did that. He likes to control stuff like this on his own. I am glad we have it but I wish there was something that we felt safe with and worked all the time.
4,Amazed Skeptic,"I purchased this for my three-year-old son to use on a 12 hour road trip. We've tried several things to keep him from slumping over or doing the head bob thing, but have had no success. I was a little skeptical when it arrived and I saw it, but I hoped for the best. When my husband saw it, he thought it was crap. My son used it and for the most part it works! Actually, it works great as long as he keeps his hands in the ""belt loop"" type thingy. The only problem we've encountered is when his hands slip out and we have to turn around and put them back in. BTW I also purchased a Toddler Coddler for my almost two-year-old son. It works okay. I think the Rest Up Right works better overall."
4,Ok,"Item works good. My daughters booster is pretty vertical in my truck, which even with this pillow, it was sometimes difficult to keep her from leaning forward. When she was reclined slightly in other cars the pillow worked great. She really loves the pillow. I will be purchasing this item for family and friends with young ones. It's worth the money and want to thank the person who came up with this idea."
3,Maybe for some,This product is a good idea but the description says it is for 3 year olds and up and I have a 3 1/2 year old and it is much too long for her even without the extender. She is pretty much of average height and I believe it could be a year or two before she could use it.
1,not worh of money,"I bought this for my 4 yr old girl whose head always dropped to the side.When she falls asleep, she doesn't TRY TO HOLD this pillow to support her head because she IS SLEEPING! I always have to climb to the back seat and adjust it. She turns her head from right to left or the other way and I can't be right by her and switch pillow back and forth. (one side is high and the other is low)It has just a couple of sponges inside so for that I think its price is not right.I'm looking for something that goes behind her head and back and has support for both sides."
3,May work better later,"My three year old grandson likes the cover on this pillow and finds it cuddly, but it's perhaps too complex for him to use just yet as he hasn't got the idea that he needs to hold it in front of himself and rest his head on it. It is also too tall, even with the pieces removed. However, it was easy to cut off another piece that I saved for later. Love the idea, but judgement is still out as to whether he'll use it or not."
3,A good idea,"This is a great idea for kids stuck in car seats who doze off. For my 3 year old though (who is 40 inches tall) the fit was not good - too big with just one of the pieces of foam removed, and too short with two pieces removed. It was uncomfortable for him and he ended up not using it, preferring to rest his head on his big teddy bear. I tried it out and found it awkward, though better than nothing, and moderately better than u-shaped neck pillows which don't prevent your head from falling forward.However, I don't like the fact that it is made of polyurethane foam, which I was unaware of before I purchased it. I have read alot of health and environmental concerns about polyurethane and am not sure if I will try it again for my son for this reason."
2,it's ok...,"bought for my son for road trips....it was just ""ok"" really. i hated the wobbly head when he fell asleep and needed something. this product did help but only a little and it needed to be strapped in with him, which is a negative. when he fell asleep i wanted to just prop up his head, but this was something you had to stop the car and strap in to help. now, it did help a little, but the process wasn't worth the purchase.would suggest just getting a travel pillow...they work just as well and easier!"
3,A word of warning,Overall I liked this performance but beware -- there are no titles. The earlier release on Image Entertainment did have them.
