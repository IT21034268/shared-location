1,Not good enough...,"While the idea behind these products from Wild Republic is a good one, unfortunately the construction and quality are extremely poor. We'd had these items for less than a few hours before arms and limbs began breaking off. If you can find them, Animal Planet makes a series of similar playsets that are of much higher quality and that our son enjoys more. Otherwise, better to do without entirely than waste money on these cheap, flimsy toys."
2,Arctic Animals,Toys are very light weight and they break easy. Not very durable for classroom use. My school kids enjoyed playing with them but they fell apart.
5,An excellent value player,"This player has been terrific since I received it! Without any trouble, it plays mpg files, mp3 files, jpg's and vcd's without any trouble. I was able to even play my region 3 dvd's without any modifications to the player.Way to go Sampo! I'm a satisfied customer."
2,JPEG bug,"I bought this unit for the jpeg compatibility. It will not play all of the files if you put more than 15-20 files in a folder! The last several photos won't show up on their menu!I have tried two of these players with the same results. I have sent a copy of one of my jpeg CDRs to SAMPO US tech support and they confirmed the problem but had no answer. They sent my CDR to Taiwan for evaluation a month ago but I""ve had no response so I'm sending my second unit back.If you want jpeg compatibility I suggest you wait until the major brands have it or you take your own CDR's to test before you buy."
2,It's Almost Like An Apex DVD Player,"Overall the DVD player is ok for the low end DVD player. Its picture quality is no match for the Sony or the Panasonic DVD player. The MP3 menu looks cheap, but it is easy to use. I got this DVD player for about six weeks and the LCD starts to have problem. Sometime while playing a movie or music CD, the LCD just automatically turns off for no reason. If you have a little extra cash then buy other popular brand, but if you don't have alot of money then you should consider this player!"
4,pretty good tuner,"This is the first tuner i have ever bought. the chromatic tuner works pretty good, but it is hard to get into some types of tuning."
3,All Are Good,"Clip on tuners seem to be very accurate. I know they are for guitars.I ordered this one and the Snark at the same time.The Snark (the red one) is more accurate and offers more features.Some customers have reported the the Intelli has trouble at times finding the ""e"".Mine has trouble with the ""B"" even when I know it is in tune.This is a good product, but I would consider the Snark"
5,Works suprisingly well,"I'm amazed at how well this device works. I've played guitar for many years and always tuned by ear, but so many times it seemed that I just couldn't get certain strings tuned right. I finally decided to buy an electronic tuner. The first time I used it, I thought it wasn't working right because I cross-checked the tuning by ear and, individually, some of the strings didn't sound right. I figured that I should give it a chance, however, and started playing and was blown away by how great the guitar sounded. I've never tried any other electronic tuner so I can't comment on how this one compares to others. This was a worthwhile purchase and a good value, as far as I'm concerned."
2,Not accurate enough,"This tuner is not sufficiently accurate for any instrument that uses paired strings that are tuned to the same pitch. Specifically mandolins and hammered dulcimers. The tuner will show each string as being at the correct pitch but your ear or a more accurate tuner will let you know that the two pitches do not match. If it isn't getting both strings to the same pitch, then tuning a violin or guitar is not getting your single string to the correct pitch some portion of the time."
3,Tuner,"A little disappointed. I think I received a used or returned product. The protective film over the face was missing and there were scratches on the face. Otherwise, the tuner works very well and is easy to use."
5,Amazing,"This tuner is amazing. It's precise, it's portable, it was inexpensive, but really great quality. I would buy another one if I had a use for it!"
4,Tuner,"I bought this to use for a guitar and a violin and am pleased with the performance. It took a bit to figure it out as the instructions seemed to be lacking but in the end, easy enough to use and gets the job done."
1,Bleh,"I had to use this book at the university, and I hated it. First of all, the prose is of a highly clunky academic style that's laughable to anyone with a decent command of the Russian language, like Vasys was on something when he wrote it. Second, the subject matter is both boring and dated. Honest to God, we are so tired of reading about Russia's climate and the history of Kievan Rus'. It's been done, guys. Over and over and over again. You'd get a better command of contemporary Russian culture and language by reading some contemporary pop lit, of which there is plenty available for kindle. But if you must have a graded Russian reader, use one from the University of Chicago series. They, at least, are interesting and well-written."
3,Good read. .,"This was a fun read, even though predictable. Iris Johansen is a favorite author of mine. Can't wait for the next one."
2,not what I expected,this was a little too dark to suit me I read some of her previous books and now I remember why it's been so long since I read another
1,JUST WASN'T THAT GOOD,"Sorry, but this book just wasn't good. I think the first problem came early on when Jared compares Cassie to a child in terms of her body. This really turns me off because early on she acts like a child also. He really thinks she's 14! That's not romantic @ all. And, ok, I know it was island culture and all but having Cassie run around Topless, just isn't romantic. It's like leave something to the imagination! And, if she is going to be topless, please don't let her body be that of a 14-year-old, and not voluptous/sexy. That way it'd be easier for me to see the initial appeal Jared sees in her."
4,Looking forward to season 2,"Great show. I really enjoy the production values, but most importantly you can really see that Dhani Jones absolutely loves what he is doing. Whether he is training in the local sport, eating the local cuisine, getting beat up, gasping for air cause he sucks at a sport, or visiting a landmark of cultural significance, he shows a sense of humor along with a but of competitive edge. I also like how he gets drunk in a couple of episodes. Plus as a man, I can take a few fashion cues from Dhani. This guy is pretty stylish. More so than Bourdain and Zimmeran. If Dhani needed to improve on something it would be his voice overs. They need to sound more natural and less scripted. But thats a nitpick. And at $19 for a whole season, you can't beat it. I wish Travel would put out blu rays as I know this show rocks in hidef!!! There's more countries and sports to tackle so I am definitely lookin forward to season 2. If you watch this I'm sure you'll agree."
5,Sad the show was cancelled... Better than Bizarre Foods!,I love football! Love the NFL.. and Dhani Jones is the best of both worlds when it comes to traveling the globe and visually describing what the rest of the beautiful planet has to offer. I ran into this show on Netflix and loved it so much I had to buy the season. If you love Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern I think you'll Enjoy this!
5,I LOVE DHANI!!!!,"Before Dhani Tackles the Globe, I had NO IDEA who Dhani Jones was. Thank God for the Travel Channel! I watched this show during primetime, and having this on DVD was a must have. I also enjoyed watching it all again. Now if only Amazon would carry Season 2 of Dhani Tackles The Globe. It's awesome so see football player with a brain, a conscience and saying something other than reaping the bling bling. If you have not heard of Dhani Jones, get into him; he's an amazing human being."
5,great,"I needed a ball for my new wall mounted flag. The one inch acrylic ball is great. I sanded a spot flat with my dremel and drilled a hole in the ball, cemented it on thin plastic stick I had left over from the flag for my scooter, dripped gorilla glue in the flag mast tube and stuck the thinner stick in it. Now I am getting silver metalic spray can to paint the ball.Next time I would get a 1-1/2 ball however. But I want this ready for memorial day."
5,Excellent reference book on the wild tukey,"This book reveals valuable information about wild turkey biology and behavior. Naturalists, wildlife biologists, and hunters would find this book useful. Scientific research is presented so that everyone can understand the data."
5,"Endearing Struggles, Roaring Passion","Kat Martin is my favorite romance writer. Her stories are compelling and her characters are strong and well-rounded. This is the story of Catrina and Domini, also known as Catherine and Dominic. The story will lead you from a gypsy camp to the society of London."
3,It was not a page turner!,"The whole story kept on revolving around Dominic not being able to have a real marriage life because of his thrist for revenge to his father for abondoning him and his mother, so he makes a vow to not marry and provide no heirs for his father's title. This was the only problem he could marry in name only, but this was also the only conflict of the Dominic's relationship with Catherine. I thought the story dragged because of this problem between them. Other than this, the whole story was actually pretty good."
5,The Best of S.A.D.,"Although it's only got six songs, ""How the Cold War Began"" is, in my opinion, the band's best work so far. If you've liked either of their full-length releases, you simply MUST own this EP. And if you've never heard of the band before, this is a great place to start. ""Temporary Felts,"" ""The Store You Deserve,"" and ""Failure of Woollett"" display the band's quiet & melancholy side, while the other three tracks show off their ability to write some damn catchy rock tunes. Well worth your money."
2,"Good bed, but the rails are small","We purchased this bed for my mother who has a cancer-related neurological disorder (paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration). The bed is good and inexpensive, however the bed rails we received are quite a bit smaller than they look on the picture. With the ones we have she's easily able to get her legs out of the bed and fall, which means we will need to purchase a second set of rails to fully close the gap. If not for this problem (which is a big safety issue) I would give this product five stars. If you need the extra safety from the bed rails, however, I suggest you either look for something else or consider purchasing a separate set of rails."
4,Not exactly what it says on the tin,If you are looking for a study or a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita then this book will leave you unfulfilled. As a stand alone guide to the spiritual life as seen by the author then this book is full of useful passages that will endear you to him and make you remember this book long after you have read it.
5,Ram Dass is great,"Ram Dass is one of the most profound writers known in my view. I've followed hime for 20+ years. This book is a great way to understand the Gita, and was set up to be read as needed, not having to go from the front to the back. It is a wonderful way to keep centered in the crazy world."
4,Bhagavat gitaby Ramdass,"It has been a very good book on the basic teachings of Bhagavat Geetha and Hinduism,though it is not a direct translation.Very useful to everybody born on this earth,which is a jewel in the basket of Almighties creation.It is a good book to learn about the self.Krishnas teachings are for ever,there is no beginning or end to what has been taught."
5,Oh yeah ; ),If your a fan of the movie I highly suggest buying this game it shows what happened off camera great game for any fan of the movie
5,Perfect!,"Every song a tune you'll remember and sing along with.Also, I agree with the other reviewer that this is superior to Richard's remastered versions."
5,Just as great now as it was in the 70's,"The music on this CD is just as wonderful now as it was back in the 70s. Karen's voice is strong, and the mixing of the instruments and backup vocals is skillfully done, just as I remembered it. This CD demonstrates the Carpenters' incredible talent. If you can have only one CD of the Carpenters, this is the one to get. What a shame to have lost Karen so many years ago."
4,Maudlin Magic,"Yes, it's sugary. Yes, it's dated. And yes, it's soppy as hell. But with Karen Carpenter's angelic vocals and brother Richard's spirited musical arrangements, who cares? Enough to move even the most jaded music critic."
5,Telling the Difference Between CD Issues,"I can't distinguish between the CD versions listed by Amazon. Who else has this problem? Under the generic title ""Carpenters - The Singles 1969-1973"", I see the following versions which could be my CD (and their prices vary widely):ASIN B000Q651WUASIN B000KFYIYOASIN B00000HY5FASIN B000Y4IAYUASIN B001PLOIZ6Is there a cross reference somewhere that lists ASIN versus UPC or CD numbers?"
2,Impossible to Read,"Schulmeyer is the Shakespeare of our generation. His work is filled with quality information that is hidden within a language that only closely resembles English. If you can make it through a chapter without falling asleep there is a lot of good information between these two covers, but it could really use a SparkNotes summary."
3,Good material for beginners,"Everybody knows that people usually stumble into SQA. So, once you get started, you will want to have some reference material.This book is easy to read & understand, and I'd recommend it to people eager to know a little more about Software Quality Assurance..."
4,Good introduction for students and curious general readers,"The purposes of Dietrich's book should be kept in mind. The book is not a detailed scholarly book and does not pretend to be. It is, however, a fair-minded and useful introduction to the PRC's history for students at the beginning undergraduate level. Students and China buffs must begin somewhere, after all, and Dietrich's book is as good as any (and much better than many) for this purpose. I have happily used the book for introductory classes I have taught in major U.S. and Canadian universities."
1,"naive, simplistic, and general","Mr. Dietrich, whatever his academic credentials, joins the ranks of many a China scholar that so romantasizes China that careful research and balance are rejected. This book is so hopelessly simplistic and over-generalized that its almost useless; documentation is almost non-existent, and his analysis of the events of modern China are reduced to a 6th grade level with scant detail and almost no evidence. The ""achievements"" of the communists in China are very romanticized and if one wishes to really understand the last 50 years of China's history, this book is not the way. Save your money!"
4,Kids LOVE it!,"I ordered this book to go along with a lesson I was teaching. I have to admit, I was a little disappointed in the book when I read it myself. I almost didn't even use it, but at the last minute decided to read it to my class. They LOVED it. They begged me to read more and began a list of who could check it out from me next. They think the files are HYSTERICAL, and my book is already looking well-worn!"
5,I love this book because its secrets are real cool.,This book has funny pictures of people plants and animals. It tells kids grownup stuff that we are not supposed to know. It's silly but it has important stuff too. My favorite part was about the sumo cell hair guys and the monster vegetables. I sleep with this book. I like it a lot.
2,"What there is, is both good and VERY overpriced.","After reading through this tiny tome twice, I have decided that; what there is, is good. However, for the price I would have expected at least 5 times as much text. There just isn't much here. Sadly."
3,Wasn't as funny as the first edition...,"Seems like all the hysterical topics like nose picking, etc were explored in the first chapter. My kids aren't too excited to read about dust bunnies..."
1,So Sad to Say ... One Page Ruined It All!,"This delightful book is one of the most imaginative I've read in ages. Unfortunately in the process of naming and describing the five fingers, it reads: ""The Dirty Digits ... This bunch of middle fingers just stands around. Thats bad enough."" Then it refers to the little fingers as ""Hell's Pinkies"". I am no where close to being a prude, but I choose not to read that to my grandaughter. She'll find out about such things soon enough, but I won't be the one to introduce it to her. I returned the book, and am so disappointed that I am unable to share the other 45 pages of cleaver words and pictures with her."
4,The Secret Knowledge of Grown-ups,"Purchased the book after reading it to my Grandson's 4th grade class. They really enjoyed it as did my grandson and he wanted to read it again. Appeals to this age group with their delight in icky and crazy things. It is sometimes difficult to find books for this age group as they aren't ready for the pre-teen stuff, but don't want to be treated as babies. This fit the bill. Also generated alot of discussion."
4,The Secret Knowledge of Grown-Ups,"Do you know why squash is named ""squash""? Why you shouldn't jump on the bed? Why you should eat your vegetables? This book offers a humorous look at the answers to these questions.In this nonsensical look at these answers, parents and children alike will laugh and enjoy it over and over again. Illustrations capture attention in a comical manner. The print is large and easy to read. As teachers, we recommend this to all ages--and teachers, too, who could use this as a springboard to creative writing."
5,This book is Fantastc!,My teacher read it to my class just for fun and we loved it. My favorite part is when the guys dresses up as an eggplant. Read this book! Don't forget to read the introduction!
1,"Sloppy, careless","Once again, I cannot get far enough into a Jecks book to tell whether or not he can tell a good story. He is so uncaring about facts that trying to get through the the first scene-setting just turns me off. I used to think it was his inexperience. Not so: apparently he just doesn't care about authenticity. I won't bother with Jecks again."
4,"Breslin almost lets us see him ""warts and all""","Although the memoir is primarily the story of Mr. Breslin's diagnosis and treatment for a serious medical condition, it is delightfully sprinkled with anecdotes that pop into his head as he's contemplating his own fate. It is these stories that make this book well worth the reading. I only wish that Mr. Breslin had been more willing to let down his guard so we could get a better glimpse of the man -- I'm certain that he's at least as interesting himself as are the stories he tells about others."
5,You Can Really Taste the Monkeybirds!,"This book is a Must-Have for anyone who enjoys do it yourself shows or books on deconstructing machines, and a Must-Cherish for any reader who loves flawless anatomy and effortless-looking sketching. The entire thing is peppered by the artist's notes about structure or how the pose relates to the character's personality. This is going onto my most-used shelf, more than holding it own against that 50$ anatomy book or 36$ comic techniques manual."
5,"Stout, German, performs as advertised","This Kettler Apollo Inversion table is very well made and advertises an ability to take pressure off unhappy human spines and pinched nerves thereby relieving pressures on spinal nerves which can be wrecking of your life. I did not find it cured the problems which required spinal fusion which Thank God, was successful. The inversion table might be one way to stave off daunting spine surgery. My spine surgery at the Cincinnati Spine Institute saved my life. The Table's one drawback is that it usually cannot make misplaced tissues migrate back to their rightful positions just by spreading apart diseased bones."
3,Hyacinth Threads,"Another lost british pop group of the late 60s,who relesed a load of singles but failed to chart in britain but did rather well in europe.This 2 cd compilation is more like an anthology covers all their a and b sides plus other recordings they did as well plus alternative tracks.Comes with a precise history of the group plus some rare photos,also includes pictures of their records and sleeves.Only thing that lets it down is the remastering could have been done better on some of the tracks."
2,Low-quality,"This Hoya UV filter is quite low-quality and seems to degrade the image quality of my pictures when using my Nikon D70 and Nikkor 70-300mm f4-5.6G AF lens. I should have spent more money and gotten a better filter. If you have nice SLR or d-SLR equipment, don't go cheap on the filter (UV or polarizing or whatever), as it does affect your image quality."
3,Dreams of the key in blue,"The main character is teacher in crime-psychology and also detective moves to a small quiet town.... Until 3 students are murdered and it looks like the work of a serial killer. He's asked to find the serial killer by the local police. The book has a lot of twists, your mind keeps spinning around about who's the killer. I gave it 3 stars because i missed the atmosphere a little in the book. Im not familiar with his work but my opion expecially about the last part of the book, everything is happening very fast. The end of the book is great, if you like a mystery book with lot of twists read it."
4,A Good Read,"The two earlier installments in the Lucas Frank series were written by Philpin and Patricia Sierra. With this novel, Philpin tackles all the writing himself, and does a wonderful job!I found the character of Lucas much more likeable in this novel. The plot moves along quickly and the writing is fantastic. Philpin includes real life examples and cases throughout the story which adds an excellent air of reality. They also serve to remind us that evil does exist in the real world, making this story all the more exciting and scary. The ending wasn't a complete surprise, but it didn't take away from an exciting conclusion."
5,Makes the most of tomorrow too!,"An otherwise boisterous group of 12 and 13 year olds sit silently when I read the daily passage from this book to the 7th grade homeroom. Now I don't even have to tell them to listen. I just open the book and start reading, and they quiet each other down. We enjoy the quotes, reflect on the explanations, and often refer back to a previously read page when someone needs encouragement or a fresh perspective. This is the sort of book that has the power to instil positive ethics and character in the young people of today, while building their self esteem and problem solving strategies. It fosters positive communication and acceptance of diversity. It came with the classroom I inherited mid-year, but I'll be buying several copies to give as gifts."
1,Awkward fit,"This review is for product & seller.I did not like this product. It's bulky & extremely uncomfortable. I'm surprised people can sleep in it. I'm petite so ordered an XS. It was too big. It offered no support to upper back and did not help posture.As for the seller. BUYER BEWARE! I suggest you shop around. I feel ripped off. I never used the product & not only did i have to pay return shipping, buy they charged a 20% restocking fee. I ended up paying $17 out of pocket just for trying the stupid thing on. Not worth it!"
4,Useful Explanation of Events Leading Up to 9/11,"This was an extremely detailed book about our problems leading up to September 11th in the Islamic World. It's a different perspective because the author isn't American. I was a Political Science major in college, so I was interested, though it is probably much more detail than most people would like. The book's best audience would be people involved in International Affairs. It would be interesting to see the author do an update and see if any of his assessments have changed."
5,An illuminating and gripping book !!,"Labeviere provides in his book a brilliant analysis on the state of international affairs. It is a frightening notion to realize that nationalism was and continues to be an obstacle for the globalization process. It is also frightening to learn that fragmentation of nations has been and will continue to be the trend where conflict is bred and cultivated, in order to make money and expand the global corporate network. Yesterday was Sovietism, today it's Islamism, who knows what evil will be next? The future looks gloomy, and the one world order appears to be already in place. I would highly recommend this book for everyone that's interested in learning about international matters, and their reverberations on our nation. Labeviere's book will provide you with an electrifying reading. His references are thorough and credible, and his writing style is eloquent."
5,plastic canvas book,Book was just as stated. Shipping was very fast. Would do business with again. Very happy with my purchase.
4,Good PNW resource,"While the pictures are terrible, the information is provided in a very straight-forward manner, with good, but not overly romantic descriptions of the various roses. I'm a newcomer to roses, and I've been frustrated by the tendency of most writers to describe every rose in very general terms. I've grown weary of reading: ""One of the best of it's class."" Allen does none of this; moreover, she is up front about what probably won't work well. Bourbons, she says, are likely to ball and be a disappointment in the rainy parts of the PNW. Now, for someone like me, just getting started, that's very useful information I have not seen elsewhere.I'm withholding one star because of the pictures. It's just a guess, but I think the printer, not the photographer is to blame for the poor quality"
2,Ya and?,"Just got the watch and was left wondering ""Ya, and so now what?"" Just a watch, no instruction on what that spinning bezel is or how to use it, no light, hard to remove the little plastic spacers on the dial.Clear numbers, clear date, easy to set once spacers are gone. Nice finish, looks good.Not bad for a $20 watch but I'm left wanting more. Look to a digital for the things like lights."
5,Good reading and good thinking,"A teacher friend gave me this book, and I love it! My family and I have discussed many of the issues raised in the text, not to mention plain old manners. I recommend this book to anyone concerned about a lack of civility in the United States."
4,Mythic Beings,"Good book for general knowledge about Northwest Coast artifacts, unfortunately it deals only with modern works which are a bit different from the old masterworks of the Northwest Coast art."
5,Mythic Beings : Spirit Art of the Northwest Coast,Great color photos and and discriptions of the carvings and artwork. I would definatly recommend this to anyone that is interested in Northwest Coast art.
4,Mine was as advertised,"I received two of these individually shrink-wrapped. They looked exactly as they do in the picture on Amazon. To me, they do not appear to be a cheap knockoff. Their fit in my microwave was a little loose, to say the least. I took a big pencil eraser, cut it in two, and pushed the pieces in between the filter and the little brackets. Now is the filter is nice and snug with no gap to let air escape."
1,Didn't fit,Tried every which way I could install the filter and still couldn't get it to fit unless I bent and reshaped the thing. Probably will have to end up spending more money to get one that actually fits properly.
3,charcoal filter,"not a perfect fit for the particular microwave/rangehood that I own, but it works well enough. Even though the specifications indicated that it was a match, once I received the product, I realized it was larger than the vent outlet. With a little elbow grease I was able to angle the filter into the slot."
1,Terrible fake filter,"Like the others said, the size is wrong. I had to use a piece of paper to hold it in place. But worse that that, it filters nothing. You end up with the noise of the fan, but no effect."
1,Fake,Terrible fake filter. This one is not the original. The buy-it-now store sells fake knock-off filters. Be aware!
1,GE JX81A Filter Kit,GE part number does not fit the models it says it fits. Had to return product and still can't find the correct filters for my microwave oven.
1,Didn't fit,"We purchased this filter back in Feb 2009 for our GE HVM1540 over-the-range microwave because at the time it said it would fit, but it didn't. Looks like they have since revised the list of models that it will fit.Was hoping to save a little money, but wound up wasting time. Had to send it back."
4,Good Facilitation Template,"I would recommend that this book be read by every project team leader as it does a good job clarifying roles of teams, its members and facilitation basics (right down to which color markers to use on a flipchart.)It's a good, nuts and bolts template for first-time facilitators. I'm an experienced technology trainer (6 years). This book was a quick-read and worked well for me when I needed to work with a task force troubleshooting interdepartmental communications. Book needs some proofreading - found lots of grammatical errors (distracting to me). Case study examples mainly focused on ""what went wrong"" but did drive some good points. Not an in-depth facilitation resource but worth it's price."
3,Was this book ever proofread?,"A very simple book, it does give some insight into facilitation, but I found it very irritating that there were typos on nearly every page! When words like 'expect' are used instead of 'except' the whole meaning has changed. And a whole page of this small guide devoted to how to turn and tear pages from a flipchart? This is a very low level primer on this subject. As a student of cooperative leadership, this book did little to enhance my knowledge of the process of facilitation."
5,Lends itself to browsing or opening to a page and random,"Now in an updated and expanded second edition, Facilitation Skills: Helping Groups Make Decisions by training and development manager and facilitator Gregory B. Putz is a step-by-step guidebook for organizing and promoting cooperation. Facilitation Skills concentrates specifically on the role of the facilitator, whose duty it is to remain neutral and help the team arrive upon a decision, as opposed to the role of team leader. Each individual page offers different tips, tricks and techniques in easy-to-read format that lends itself to browsing or just opening to a page and random. Simple black-and-white sketches illustrate this superbly presented, highly recommended, ""user friendly"" guide for anyone assuming responsibility for team facilitation."
5,Beautiful little duck,"I bought this as a gift for someone who loves and collects ducks. He absolutely LOVED it. It is much smaller than the description shows. I believe when I ordered it the description is wrong or perhaps referring to the box it comes in. It's only a couple of inches long and tall. But it's well worth it. If you collect ducks or collect art glass, you'll like it. The color in the glass is beautiful. The picture here doesn't do it any justice. I've never been that into ducks, but now that I've seen this, I want one. =)"
5,Good Purchase,This book is an excellent purchase for somebody who has spent some time with the boxed set and wants to take Battletech to the next level. This adds level 2 rules and clarifies other rules. An excellent companion to the 3050 tech readout.
5,As good as it gets.,"Let's get right down to it. This book is sensibly organized and many rules have been clarified (as a matter of fact the most significant changes are noted near the back for ease of reference). Some new level 2 equipment has been added (Inner Sphere) as well as several suits of battle armor. The extensive salvage and repair rules from Maximum Tech are also present.As for missing the Protomech rules from TRO 3060: this is actually a good thing. Protomechs are a foolish idea that unbalance the game, while TRO 3060 is a piece of garbage.One final note... this write-up is for the unrevised rulebook. The revised rulebook is another piece of trash."
2,A poor excuse for a rule book,"The simple fact is that the book could have been done much better. There are only a handful of new weapons and the rule clarifications are nice but common sense. Most players had already interperated the rules any way (e.g. torso twisting). The art in the book is mostly re hashed from earlier works. Finally, Fasa releases the book and THEN releases Tech Readout 3060 with the ProtoMech rules. Why not release the ProtoMech with the Master Rulebook? Now you players get to buy both!"
4,Good,It is allright. The margins are narrower than the original I had read but that is really irrelevant. I like it.
4,Hoya 52MM Circular works great!,"I've been using this and like it says it does bring the details out especially when it comes to landscapes. I've used it to make the oceans for fleshed out and skies bluer instead of it being dull. I love this polarizer and couldn't imagine how long I haven't been using one. Granted, theres always photoshop, but, this would eliminate some of the problems that you would face right off the bat.For me, I think its worth the purchase."
4,Inexpensive solution,"There are a lot of expensive circular polarizing filters out there. Frankly, I can't tell the difference between this one and other more expensive ones I've used. I'm sure there are professionals out there whose careers depend on having the best. But if you're an advanced amature photographer as I am, this will suffice for most all of your outdoor needs. If you've not used a circular polarizing filter before, be sure to read up on how to use them, what to expect, and then go practice with it so you'll know how it can help improve the color quality in your photos. This filter is a good place to start."
3,"Quite adequate, not outstanding","I've had two other circular polarizing filters, and this just doesn't seem to do quite as well as those did. However, it's satisfactory, and certainly good to have in your bag when you need it. Given the price of circular polarizing filters, unless you really need one often, or have need of a top-notch CP filter for a demanding shot, this will do quite well. Nothing spectacular, but no significant complaint either (using a Nikon D70)."
4,Noticeable polarization effect,"I have had no problem with this product. I'm a beginner, and not too knowledgeable. But, I found that it does work on changing reflections and filtering them. Affordable, and goes well with my Nikon 35mm f1.8 lens."
4,Perfect Filter,This Hoya filter 52mm circular polarizing glass filter arrived well packaged. No dust or chips or cracks in filter. The product was flawless. Works great on the Nikon D5100 on a number of different lenses. The threading on the filter was perfect no issues. Filter works as well as you would expect.
5,Works well,Does everything it is supposed to. No ghosting. No flare. What more can you ask? A more convenient case would be nice I suppose.
2,Circular versus Linear,"I bought one of these - heard all the talk about some polarisers messing up auto-focus so went with the circular (although I don't use auto-focus a lot). I shoot film (Nikon F90X) & frankly I was VERY disappointed: the effect was way milder than I expected. One day as an experiment I shot my digicam thru my sunglasses and voila!! That's the look I was after - the super intense colors & classic ""black sky"" look. Went to my local camera store & told them that's the look I wanted & they handed over the LINEAR polariser. My Nikon immediately got the look I wanted.It seems to be photography lore that ""thou shalt use a circular polariser"", and I spose there must be something to it, but before you hand over the cash just be sure it's gonna work for YOU. I do mostly manual focus of landscape/abstract stuff, so maybe I'm a special case, but I LOVE my **linear** polariser & use it ALL THE TIME, while my circular is in the drawer at home. Buyer beware."
2,not filter out reflectance too much!,"On pak box doesn't tell you too much about spec. I checked website, it says to get better effect, is aim to surface above 35 degree. I tried at 35 degree, it just filtered out some reflectance, but not too much.Other angles no matter how you rotate the ring, it does NOT work to filter out the reflectance.I tried take picture with it, from outside window. The result is terrible, no polarizing effect at all: many many reflectance there. I remember at old time my Kenko and K-mart brand polarizing filter can easily filter out a lot of reflectance, why this newer Hoya can't do it?I guess either it's defect, or, the polarizing is just a gimmick!"
2,"Glass is fine, but construction is cheap","The glass for this polarizer worked great. The only problem was that the retaining ring that holds the spinning glass element to the screw mount for the lens popped after only a handful of uses, rendering it useless. I initially liked this one better than the sunpak filterrs because it was thinner, but the construction seemed to be cheap. I may have just gotten a dud, but a product shouldn't fail after being used only a handful of times."
2,"works, but a warning","I ordered this after the first polarizing filter I ordered was a linear filter (they didn't mention this on the other listing).While it works fine and has provided some good photos, when it came time to remove this filter from the lens more than once I was unable to remove it. The reason for this is the outer adjustment ring is the same diameter as the knurled body. When you try and grip the filter and remove, the adjustment ring spins, but the filter threads will not budge. It required LARGE pliers to grip and remove. Other filters I have used (different brands) have a slightly larger thread diameter ring section, so you can actually grip the filter and remove it."
2,It's Not Multicoated. Leaves a funny flare when taking pictures of light.,"It works as a polarizer no doubt. Fits right on my 50mm lens.But it creates a wierd greenish flare when I am taking pictures of any light source (e.g. lamps, sunlight).But sometimes flares are cool. I would recommend spending more money on a multicoated circular polarizer, or not buying any at all."
5,Lifesaver,"This filter is amazing. It makes the skies bluer, and the clouds stand out so much better. Also, it arrived the day before a big car show, and without it my pictures wouldn't have been anywhere as good."
1,decent product with major drawback,I have used other polarizing filters and the output of this filter if good but nothing extraordinary. I am happy with the output of the glass element. However this product has a major drawback for which i am forced to give one star. I mounted this on a UV filter and they got stuck although they were not tightly coupled.While trying to rotate the adjustment thread is only rotating and it is impossible to grip the polarizer filter thread to rotate as it is too thin. Now i am left with an expensive UV filter fitted to a polarizer :( . I was probably lucky that i didnt mounted this directly on the lens. Buyers be aware of this issue before deciding to buy this.
4,"Lean, Mean and Lonesome by Annette Broadrick (Large Print Silhouette Desire)","Description from the book back cover:Love? Rafe McClain had always avoided it. He lived solo and liked it that way. Until a mysterious plea for help had the rugged mercenary heading back home, a veritable knight in shining armour. And at home waited Amanda Crenshaw, the woman who once-upon-a-time won his heart. Taking what Mandy offered proved impossible to resist. But soon Rafe would be gone again, unless Amanda could transform this lean, mean loner into the loving family man he desperately longed to become ..."
5,"If you like The Onion, you'll LOVE Modern Humorist","Did you know that George W. Bush draws infantile versions of Marvel Comics characters like Mr. Fantastic and The Thing? That he scrawls moronic rebus puzzles to help him remember the names of his staff? That he's a mentally impaired stooge of big-money Republican Party puppet-masters? Okay, maybe you already knew that last one, but the first two and many other startling revelations are contained in this laugh-out-loud funny offering from Modern Humorist, the funniest humor machine in the world today. This book shows you everything that's going on in George W. Bush's mind, so not only is it funny, it's really short. If you like The Onion, Saturday Night Live, Conan, South Park, or Al Gore, you will love this book. Buy it TODAY -- or, if you're really busy, TOMORRROW!"
2,"Funny, but not that great","I'm bug fans of Modern Humorist, and not a fan of Bush. This book is funny, but even with it's crayon writings and ""memos"" from Bush, the books gets tiring once you've read it once. Funny the first time then it looses it's humor."
4,Not Bad!!!,This book was a great review for NBEO Part I (which i just took). I would recommend this for all the second year optometry students studying like mad for the boards!! Good to use as a supplement after studying each subject.
4,Bought for acoustic guitar quick tuning.,"The price was right and it was packed well for shipping. It works well, easy to see and tune with. So far I am not unhappy with this purchase."
4,Great for tuning any string instrument,"My husband had me buy this. In fact he had me buy two. He has several guitars, a banjo and yuke. He uses this to help tune all the instruments. He used to use a tuning fork. This makes it so much easier, as the screen turns green when he has it where it should be. He loves it."
1,NOT A HAPPY CAMPER,"ITEM DOES NOT WORK AT ALL MOST OF THE TIME AND OTHER TIMES IT ""MAY"" WORK ON THE FOUR FIRST STRING ONLY, AND IS VERY SLOW. I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER."
3,not very secure,Does not keep good contact with head stock Always having to move and adjust Would not recommend to a friend
4,Does it's job,What do you want from a tuner. To help tune your guitar and this item does just that.Shipped quick and works as expected.
3,Buzzy,"I purchased this on the great reviews. The tuner seemed to work very well as a tuner. However, it is designed to clip on to your instrument and be available for immediate use. As soon as I clipped it on, I heard a buzzing sound. It took about 10 minutes to figure it out, but the three buttons on the device rattle, so it makes an annoying buzzing sound :-("
2,You get what you pay for,"Same experience as Mr. Kupo.It needs to be completely quiet in the room for this thing to work at all. Even then, it often displays the wrong note, and for the E string it displays it for such a short time I can't even tell if it's tuned properly.Overall, I have a tuner app on my iPhone that I went back to using because this thing is so frustrating to use. Either buy something better or save your money for something else-it's not worth having around."
3,Low E (and A) are a pain,"I've had the Intelli IMT-900 for several months. Being my first chromatic tuner it was cool at first and I put up with the fact that low E is so difficult to read. But this is a tool and over time it got to be too much of a pain in the rear. Sometimes it just won't read it (low E), sometimes it will pick it up if you go to the 12th fret... or if you reposition the unit 3 or 4 times... or it will read it for a second (literally) and then drop off.... sometimes it will read it but tell you it's an 'A'.... sometimes it just refuses. And 'A' is difficult at times. This occurs on all 3 of my acoustic guitars. If I had not kept it too long I would return it. I debated between 2 and 3 stars - the unit is bright, easy to use (except as noted above), has good mechanical adjustments, seems to be well made, and will transpose (flat/sharp) - but it has shortcomings in performing it's primary function."
1,Not a good product.,I wish I had spent more time on research before choosing the Intelli IMT-900. Many of the reviews indicate that the product will not work for low E and A. That is definitely correct. It will not read anything. I would recommend the seller of this product do some testing of their own. They will find the product to be inferior and shoud discontinue to sell it. I don't know how many of these are returned to the seller but if they all perform like the one I purchased then all should be returned. I would like to return this but it's probably more trouble than it's worth. You get what you pay for so steer clear of this product.
1,really basic. confusing descriptions,Only chapter 2&3 are worth reading. chapter one is ok if you remember no HS chemistry or physics. Chapter 4 on diodes and transistors starts well but leaves you a bit confused in the end.Chapter 5 is bad because of the missing information in chapter 4.The rest of the book is a waste.Still looking for a book on electronics that will let me have a clue as to how circuits are designed.
1,VERY UNHAPPY,"I purchased a Zenith r50z26 new and the TV was stuck in HDTV and could not choose standard or DVD format. I called Zenith and I was very rudely told to call a local TV repair shop. I did so to find out the local TV shop that Zenith recommended knew nothing about HDTV's. I called Zenith back and was referred to another local TV shop. The repair man came out and said there was a bad chip in the TV that they had to take it to the shop to be fixed. It has now been 2 weeks and the repair man told me it should be 7 to 10 days. The repair shop still can not fix the TV. So I called Zenith back to ask how long I would have to wait and I was told ""You have to wait as long as it takes"" I replied ""Why do you customers get such poor service"" and I was hung up on.BEWAREG .GILL(VERY UNHAPPY)"
2,Oh My,"I was very tempted to buy this unit, almost clicking the ""Add to Cart"" button, when I noticed the reviewers had listed it as 1 star. Quickly reading the review posted by a very helpful purchaser, I decided not to buy this unit. Now back to the drawing board!"
3,Just ok,"Lawence Block, can a moments be very entertaining, but so far everything that I have read by him, takes way to long to get me involved. A great book to keep by your nightstand. If you can't get to sleep, just read a few pages, It should do the trick. When any of his characters enters a room, you will get a full discription of everything in the room. Good writing, just a little slow."
1,I Ching for Beginners: A Modern Interpretation of the Ancient Oracle (For... Mark McElroy,This was mistakenly ordered and the person who sent it was so gracious and asked me to keep it. He was so very nice and I thank him.
2,I Ching; For Beginners....,"Mark McElroy, in my opinion, did an excellent job explaining the 'ancient oracle' mentality. It's the term 'oracle' that sticks in my throat. Oracle? My goodness, just get yourself a pair of dice and keep throwing them until the exact number desired surfaces.I Ching, again in my opinion, is nothing more than a children's game made as complicated as possible to pass for some zenmaster's revelation.I was not disappointed in Mark McElroy's explanation. I was disappointed to learn that adults actually rate this foolishness seriously."
2,Missing my song :-(,"I wanted to get the soundtrack for Slither for one particular song that I enjoyed (no, not 'Baby I Love You', although I liked that one too). The song played during the closing credits and was called 'The New Kid'. It says in the movie credits that it's written and performed by 'The Old 97's'. I don't see it on the list among the songs on the soundtrack, so I don't see the point of buying it. The one song I like isn't there and the other one has the naughty language edited out. I'll pass."
1,Baby I Love You Solution,"You can get the unedited ""Baby I Love You"" at iTunes.Yes, yes, they're the devil, but at least you can get the song the way the Yayhoos performed it, instead of this Wal-Mart version."
1,Thanks every other reviewer...,"just caught the movie on late night tv, loved two songs at the closing credits, came straight on to Amazon to buy the soundtrack. i would have wasted my money if not for the very imformative reviews here. Two songs i wanted, 1 has been mutilated by some holier-than-thou idiots, and the other isn't even featured on the cd. Disgraceful. Thanks for the reviews. I'm off to look up 'The Old 97's' now, and already being a Dan Baird, fan i will be buying 'The Yahoos' cd. Thanks for saving me money and disappointment. cheers. Rob."
4,Where is Baby I Love You?,"I also enjoyed the music for this fun and slimy film (good middle of the late, late night flick, I cringed and laughed! Well done!). ""Baby I Love You"" - unedited - can be found on The Yayhoos' album ""Fear Not The Obvious"", along with an interesting cover of ""Dancing Queen"" - our battle cry from our teenage days - those of you older...no...not OLDER...I meant....SEASONED.....chicks out there."
4,Soundtrack for the movie Slither,Couldn't find it in the stores but did find it at Amazon. Price was good and delivery fast. Love it!! (Except they omitted a cuss word)
2,EPISODES ARE CUT!!!!!,"I purchased this set because of the good reviews. I guess I should know better because 95% of Amazon reviews are worthless. It would of been nice if someone had mentioned the opening credits were missing from all the episodes. They only show them once with the menu. For that reason only, I cannot recommended the set. I will be selling mine. This could have been a great release. The quality looks good and appears otherwise complete. Timeless Media has screwed the consumer again with another edited release. I called and let them know how furious I am about this and encourage others to call and complain about this and their other butchered releases. The show is worth 5 stars but I only gave 2 because of Timeless Media's moronic decision to omit the titles. I will not buy any release by them and hope others will not either."
4,Enjoyable,I enjoyed Laredo when it was on in the 60's and still enjoyed it. I hope there are more even though it was only on for I believe 2 seasons.
3,Best of Laredo Season 1,I thought that this was the complete season one of Laredo. I must have miss read it. I was dissapointed in the selection of the episodes selected as 'the best'. None of my favorite episodes with Linda Little Trees and Blue Dog were there. Other than this I enjoyed watching Laredo again.
2,Episodes don't even show the Series Title!?? AVOID!,"IF you were not familiar with this TV series, you wouldn't know what show this is! There is no Title Screen that says ""Laredo"" - Obviously CUT!DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! RIP OFF!"
4,A Fun Western,Laredo is a funny western and kind of in the same theme as an early Bonanza. Enjoyed it very much. Picture quality is very good. I would recommend for a light-hearted show.
2,Diappointing,"I loved this series in my youth; but, alas I find that as an adult - this TV show was so goofy that I'll probably never finish watching the episodes. It's hard to believe that we loved this so much in the 60's."
4,Good Item to have for all cameras.,"First...it works, reducing UV.Second... it protects your lens from scratches and other damage.Third... It isn't expensive.Get any good brand."
5,good lens protector,"I purchased this filter to protect the front element of my lens. And protect it did. I dropped my photo bag, with the camera inside facing lens-down, and the fall jammed the lens cap into the lens. Well, the filter was in the way, and took the hit. Rest in Peace, sacrificial 52mm UV filter, you performed your duty well."
2,Smokescreen,"Save your money on this book. It does contain some very important facts concerning the explosion at the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City, but nothing new. If you want to know facts about the entire treasonous terrorist act, then spend your money on Freedom's End, and Other's Unknown. These particular authors were there, with first hand accounts of the truth, and the withholding of information by the U.S. Justice Department, and other agencies. This book by Mr. Rappoport, lacks depth, and has more filler than substance. Although he is concerned with the act of terrorism and treason, he just does not have enough facts about the case in general."
5,Great book for a novice,"I found this book to be very helpful in hooking up my new HDTV, VCR, Cable box and Tivo. By doing it myself, it saved me quite a bit of money. In addition to hooking everything up, I feel much more informed and understanding of how the whole system works. I actually enjoyed the learning experience and would recommend this book to anyone who simply wants to know how the whole thing works, or who wants to save money by doing it yourself. I do kind of think that someone who has no interest in computers, or anything technical might find the book not to their liking."
4,A Guide For Consumers,"The book is primarily designed for consumers interested in finding out more about the hasics of HDTV for a home environment. It was not intended to be a technical discussion on HDTV. It was published before the US switched to the new DTV format from analog broadcasting. With the new broadcast standards, TV sets on sale are basically DTV, but some aspects of the book are still useful, particularly for such considerations as choice of set types, mounting, etc."
2,Disappointing,"I have read and other Kathy Kelley books, but I found this one very disappointing. The 2 main characters were one dimensional and boring. It seems that the only plot was just to glue the sex scenec together. Not a book I would recommend."
3,A training book,"This book concentrates on flatwork and jump training. My rating of a 3 is based on the fact that I would have liked more pictures of correct, competition jumping, instead of the concentration on the training aspect."
5,Great Fun,"I really enjoy this series, and wish it was available on DVD to enjoy again! The children are very good, believeable and yet not believeable at the same time. The stories are fun and eminently re-watchable."
5,Outnumbered is very funny.....,"Love this show, it doesn't have a laugh track/live audience which i prefer, the kids are great and the parents are brilliant!!......karen, the young girl must get to adlib her lines, and she delivers them with such conviction, and in that British accent too!...the other tv show online site, HuPlus has 3 seasons of it...it makes my day.....give it a chance...."
5,Insider's View,If you appreciate the true Hip-Hop underground and want to get a look at the studios of the best producers and DJ's from the scene - this is the ticket. An instant classic.
3,Hiphop home studios,"I bought this for my 19 yr old son who is at university studying music and technology and has produced a CD on the history of HipHop which is highly regarded(no parental preference involved) and he says this book is cool,especially the Cd inside which has some rare unavailable tracks on it.That's it! Cool."
2,Too little detail,"The review for this book states that you will find ""revealing"" photgraphs and invites you to walk into the private world of the hip hop producer, etc, etc. I was looking for a book that would give captions that at least detailed the equipment in each home studio. Instead, what you get is a bunch of nearly useless photos with no captions. Most of the photos are taken from such a deep perspective that you can't even make out what you are looking at. My favorites are the close up picture of the torn up chair and close up picture of a sub being held together with duct tape. Those wasted close ups should have been directed towards the equipment. There are a couple of studios where pictures were close enough to see the artists racks but for the most part the pictures are way too ""abstract."" I would not recommend buying this book new. You will look at it once and never pick it up again."
5,I thought it was too good to be true,"After looking in many stores with no luck, I turned to the internet. The product usually sell for $7-$8 for one box, so when I found this three pack for the same price, I thought something was amiss. I received three boxes for the price of one. I couldn't be happier!"
2,Not worth the $$,"First of all, I love Total Immersion and have been using Terry Laughlin's methods for years, even before everyone else started copying him! As the hardest part of swimming, no matter what the method, is the breathing part, I looked forward to this new DVD. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. There was not much new here, just a reworking of the same material in Terry Laughlin's other (very good) DVD's. Not enough depth into each topic, lots of views of Terry in an Endless Pool with some occasional poor form to boot.To summarize:If you're a beginner, or new to Total Immersion: Instead, tryFreestyle: Made Easy, orEasy Freestyle Swimming by Terry LaughlinIf you're an intermediate or experienced swimmer or triathlete: Don't bother."
2,Borrow it from the library instead,"Not wanting to drop the money for this dvd, I checked it out from the library. I am glad I did. You can learn the same skills illustrated in this dvd by searching google and watching videos on youtube. The 50 minute dvd could have been cut down to 30 minutes or less if they cut out long segments showing Terry swimming with little or no instruction. If you decide you want to learn and apply the methods in this dvd, save your money and borrow it from your local library instead."
2,Sounds like a less expensive monster cable,"I A/B tested this cable against a monster cable costing 1/5 as much. While there were very minor differences in the sounds, it was virtually indiscernible. One of my friends actually preferred the sound of the less expensive cable. Red Rose's main components are great, but I wouldn't bother with this."
5,A Knock-out Collection,"Spectrum 11 is a stunning gathering of exceptional talent. I'm not sure of the motives or reasons for describing it as ""tepid"", but that is definitely an inappropriate characterization. If anything Spectrum 11 is quite progressive--there are new approaches, new interpretations, new spins on familar themes, that make this book and the art inside both refreshing and exciting. Whether it's the political implications of Eric Joyner's cover, the biting humor of Todd Schorr's ""An Alien In the Land of Make-Believe"", the disturbing visions of Edward Binkley or the amazing dramas portrayed in the paintings by Jon Foster--there's plenty to not only enjoy but also to think about. If you love fantasy (of ""phantasy"") and science fiction art, you'll love this book!"
3,Classic approach to constructive figure drawing,"A thorough, though somewhat dated work on the constructive approach to figure drawing. It's still a useful reference for practitioners of this method, though styles, methods, and preferences have changed over the years. Other excellent references for realistic figure drawing include RyderThe Artist's Complete Guide to Figure Drawing: A Contemporary Perspective on the Classical Tradition, CivardiDrawing The Female Nudeand SheppardDrawing the Female Figure."
1,The Figure,I was disappointed when I reviewed this book. It is more straightline drawings with no rendering.
4,Torah Story,Great book! Lots of info on the culture and practices of the ancient Hebrews. Can be a little repetitive at times but overall a good tool to help you study the Torah.
5,Good filter.,"Fits well into the car.Costs way less compare to what the dealer wanted.Seems to preform the same as stock, no complaints."
4,"Good music, lets me focus on work","Like a lot of people, I'm not sure about the effectiveness of the subliminal reinforcements but find this CD good background music while I am working (writing, grading papers, ...). The tracks are all pleasant but not distracting. I also find its length makes it a perfect timer: when the CD ends, it's time to stand up and stretch or do something else for a while so that I don't get stiff from sitting too long."
3,Not what I'd hoped for,"The music is somewhat bland and child-like. It's easy to listen to but not to like. Neither soothing or interesting, it reminds me of non-fat milk."
3,Good case but...,"I bought this for an amd athelon 64 atx board so the duct doesn't line up-customer service said to remove this feature it works for intel only and amd's athelon 64 run cooler anyway.The door broke off the first day I used it, not because it was a defect but because it is weak when open because the hinge support is a small piece of plastic.The power supply may be to weak with my graphics card I wish I had a 500 watt. The case fan doesn't plug in to my mb which has amd's cool n quiet feature and would have controlled fan speed. The power supply fan does have feed back and is mostly quiet while the case fan has an internal 3 sped fan adjustment and can be left on low. quite frankly any case would have been just as quiet if you get the right fans or install a fan controller or DIY install a 3 watt 25 ohm variable resistor/rheostat (google fan speed modding). I think this is over priced old technology and I now hate drive door covers."
2,Weak power supply,"Antec has dropped the ball on this one. My power supply came in DOA.If you read reviews there are lots of reports of short life on power supply.The case weighs 25 pounds. It is a major hastle to uninstall everything and mail it back to California.It is a pretty case with some well thought out features, but not worth reliability hastles."
2,"Case is Pretty Good, Power Supply Rotten","I like the style and functionality of the case. It is quiet and looks nice, but the CPU air duct thingy seems a little more gimmicky than practical.The weakness is the Antec SmartPower 450 Watt power supply (PSU). In theory it is a good power supply, but in reality has shown lack of durability. There have been quite a few people complaining of complete PSU failure within a year. Yesterday my own failed on me and I had to go buy a new one. These things aren't that cheap! On the plus side, the PSU has a 3 year warranty. Trouble is I can't allow my machine to be down for several weeks while Antec sends me a new one."
2,Sonata II PSU is junk,"I love the looks of this case; although, I am concerned a bit about the front cover. Wish I didn't have to open it every time to turn unit on. Now for the bad - my PSU didn't last the 1+ years that most do...it died in 2 days! I am VERY disappointed since the reason I bought this case was b/c of Antec's reputation for great power supplies. Sonata III uses completely different PSU so I'm guessing Antec figured out this PSU is junk."
4,Great case!,"I bought this case to upgrade my computer and test several motherboard / cpu combinations. I have been able to run several combinations (P4 / 478, D805 / 775, and C2Duo / 775) with no problems. I put in several harddrives, CD/DVD drives, extra cooling, and several peripherals. The case has handled everything I threw at it. I still have to test it with a RAID configuration but not bad so far...I have seen several reviews about the PSU failing after a few months but I have not had it that long. The PSU has done a good job so far requiring less power than I expected for the various configurations. The wiring was clearly labeled and easy to use.My one complaint was the passive cooling system. I had to remove the custom Antec air intake flow to install components. Not a big deal but I won't put it back in. I would definitely consider the case again."
2,Really disappointed with the Sonata II,"I purchased the Antec Lifestyle Sonata II case because I liked the looks and design and was looking forward to putting my P4 components in a quieter case. And much to my dismay when I opened the case up I found a piece of black plastic laying in the bottom. So I searched around and discovered it was suppose to be holding the front grill on. Being curious, I pulled on the front grill a little bit and heard a couple more plastic pieces come flying off. Maybe not the best idea in the world, but it proved to me that there are some seriously cheap plastic parts on this case that is touted as being steel. And to top it all off, I squeezed the tabs on the air filter to pull that out and the darn thing broke into pieces in my hand. So now I'm out over $100 bucks trying to decide if I want to use this case still or not. I'd have to recommend passing on this one."
3,A Dictionary of Christian Spirituality,"Not what I thought it was, but interesting reading. Prompt delivery, excellent condition though used. PURCHASED FROM AMAZON!"
1,NOT WHAT WAS DESCRIBED,"The description of this camera states that it is panoramic. It is not, so needless to say I was quite disappointed."
2,A little informative,"It was ok but not very professionally taped. There were instances of a kid and dog interupting filming. While they were focasing on keeping everything very sterile, the dog kept standing over the beer and a lot of background noise and interuptions by the kid. Other than that, it was interesting watching the process."
3,Some Adjustments needed,"I had to re-drill the holes on the rack mounting portion to hit the regular 19"" rack. Not a big issue, but if it is supposed to fit a rack, then it should fit the rack."
2,Terrible for composers,"You would think that since the author is a composer, that this book would be helpful to composers. I am beginning a graduate film scoring program, and I bought this book to help teach myself Logic, but now I will just have to pay someone to teach it to me. Although there is a good bit of discussion of MIDI, the book doesn't really explain anything -- it gives you just enough information to see what kinds of things are possible, and that's it. Seriously, the manual that comes with Logic is WAY better (although that hasn't really fulfilled my needs either), and explains things in MUCH more depth than this book. Save your money."
4,Fab,"We love this, use it all the time. I think I'd go with a sitting juicer next time, but husband prefers this one instead."
4,Excellent overview of how to use the chakras to heal,"Lansdowne delivered a good explaination of the plains of existence along with an overview of the major chakras. While he provides a good explanation of how to use the chakras to heal, Lansdowne failed to provide any in-depth material regarding how to develope the chakras. Apart from this fact, this is an excellent book for anybody interested in essoteric healing. Beginners should buy and read a book that describes meditation techniques used to develope the chakras before moving on to this book."
4,Excellent overview of how to use the chakras to heal,"Lansdowne provided an excellent overview of the chakras and the use of the chakras in healing. However, he lacks any in-depth information regarding meditation techniques to develope the chakras in order to perform healing. Lansdowne merely gives a brief summary of what you shouldn't do. For example, he states that you shouldn't concentrate on a chakra center to develope it. This according to Lansdowne can have serious reprocussions. Buy a book on developing the chakras through meditation to go along with this book."
3,Worked well after hacking it up,Worked well after I hacked it up a bit. In order to get it to fit onto the brake caliper I had to remove the front plate using a punch. I then drilled out the holes in the front plate so that it would fit on and off easier. Also filed the pins to clean it up. Needed to spin the bracket off and then put it all back together on the caliper get it to fit.Once the mods were made it worked very well.
5,Perfect replacement for my broken one,I got this to replace my previous (different brand) one that I had used for 2 years. It no longer worked. This one works fine and was much less expensive. I keep it in the glovebox with a short firewire cable ready to go. I use this with my firewire 2nd generation iPod to listen to books on CD on longer trips.
5,Puts the jazz and funk back in acid jazz,"Japanese siren Monday Michiru's influenes really gels here. She's got enough self-confidence that she isn't scared to let a few instrumentals shine, but that's probably because she knows her voice is pure magic. She's been at this game a long time, and this record is a great launching point into her world. The tracks are funky, with hints of modern electronic musings matched with acoutic instrumentation. Simply phenomenal."
3,This is Monday - Up to date in drum n' base world!,"This is an album where Monday is turning the wheel even more. It's somithin for all music lovers but don't think it's anythin' like Delishious Poison ..... You'll be disapointed. I aggree with Gizz on that! You might wanna try something easeir listening first before going into Double Image 'couse on this one Monday is really showing up her ""duoble image"".Sony Luxo."
5,overprised compared to any store prices,"I am familiar with this product for many years and I want only to stress here, that I paid here on Amazon almost 50% more than the store prise, which is my fault."
4,Decent photo book of the popular TV soap,"""The Dallas Family Album"" was one of a trio of ""Dallas"" books released by Bantam Books and Lorimar Productions in October 1980, to coincide with the new season of the show that fall, as ""Dallas"" was beginning to get very popular. (The other two books were ""The Quotations of J.R. Ewing"" and ""The Ewings of Dallas"" novelization.) The family album is very much a photo book of the stars of the show, arranged like an actual Ewing photo album would be arranged. In the center of the book is a series of pages with bios on each of the major stars, and color photos. It's a softcover coffeetable-type of a book, nice for the ""Dallas"" collector."
1,Total JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK,"Yes, this is a piece of sh--. The company WILL NOT back it up. It will never work. Send it back, pay the freight, over and over, it WILL NOT WORK. I am going to make a video of me destroying this total POS and send it to LG. Makes me think LG just totally sucks. Cmon LG, ever heard of a recall? The thing is, I have their top of the line washer and dryer, refrigerator, etc. They all work. Not this POS however. It is the most useless brand new item I ever owned. I bought an OPPO. It has been flawless for a year....perfect. I wish I could think of a way to somehow cause LG to pay for something useless like I have. All I can think of is vandalizing something of theirs. I am smarter than that however. If you have one, take it to your nearest Salvation Army and claim it is worth hundreds or something...just get rid of it. I am not doing that because I want to beat it to death."
4,Very good player-but......,"I've owned 2 of these and they are great if you have an older hdtv without either a dvi or hdmi input-just componet inputs-they can be hacked to upscale to 720P or 1080I through componet. They are great at playing xvid/divx, but here's the catch-sometimes you will get a momentary dropout in the video-it's not consistent. I think it has something to do with video level-both of the ones I own will do it-but again-not consistently. The DCDI Genesis chip only works on the 720P and 1080I resolutions-not 480I or 480P. On some displays the ""macroblocking"" problem is evident. But still the pluses far outweigh the minuses with this player."
5,studies in color and line,"Alexei von Jawlensky (1864-1941) was born in Russia but spent most of his life in Germany, until the Nazi confiscation of his work, when it was deemed ""degenerate"", and he was forced to move to Switzerland.In the final decade of his life, Jawlensky did series of geometric heads, where the influence of icons from his native Russia could be seen, with their thick outlines and meditative feeling.Along with fellow Russian and friend Wassili Kandinsky, Jawlensky was a great influence in early 20th century abstract expressionism, and his paintings are becoming highly prized, with one of his works, ""Shokko"", recently selling for over $ 8 million.This print of ""Abstract Head"" from 1929, is an example of the many geometric heads he painted, and the original is oil on linen-finish paper, mounted on cardboard, 36 x 25 cm. in size, and hangs in the Merzbacher Collection, Switzerland"
2,Overpriced and Academically Thick,"We are using this book for a graduate course, and I've now read 11 chapters thus far. The book reminds me of a compilation of several academic papers (and that's not a compliment). I find that almost all the information in this book I can find on the web for free and explained better. Further, the authors have very little skill in explaning concepts and providing understandable examples for their audience. Our professor has to supplement this book with hand-outs just so the class can understand better. This book may be good for other academic stiffs versed in SOC already, but it is terrible for experienced computer scientists looking to enter the subject."
3,Does its job and nothing more,"A lot of the information in this book is self-explanatory, and the tougher aspects(OWL,RDF) not nearly enough information was put in. The expanded sections on logic with time as a parameter was interesting, as well as the transaction protocols, but after a while it was like beating a dead horse and it seemed there was distinct lack of meat to the book. I would have prefer he expanded on the abstract theory and transactional logic in a more rigorous sense and would have spent much less time on the more common sense factors in Service Oriented Computing. That being said, this is the programming model of web programming, and any CS or IS person would be well suited to learn it."
3,Stained Glass,"I gave this drama 3 stars because of the ending. It's a ""What the heck?"" ending and leaves you ticked off because you've spent hours with these characters knowing love will prevail or that there will a resolution between two main characters. It is the story of three friends, two boys and one girl, of competition and rivalry, love and loyalty. I actually enjoyed it...until the end. Still, if the price isn't too steep, it is worth purchasing."
5,Scott Mosher: Inferno,"INFERNO is Mr. Mosher's third CD (following VIRTUALITY in 2001 and AMBIENT EARTH in 1996) and continues in his tradition of synthesizing heavy progressive rock and ambient electronic music embellished by melodic guitar work, mellifluous vocals and impressionistic lyrics. INFERNO delves further into the worlds of hauntingly melodic and dark evocative music. With a stronger emphasis on vocal arrangements, guitar-based dynamics and dramatic song structures, INFERNO makes a bold statement as the next step in artistic evolution... and fits all head sizes."
2,Not received as ordered,"The knob itself is just what I wanted. What I am upset about is the fact that instead of the set of 4 knobs (as listed), I received a single knob. I needed 4!"
5,Awesome,I really Enjoyed reading this book and am also looking forward to reading the other titles I have already uploaded for reading.
3,"Not Marvel, but not bad","Kinda of supprising for me was this game. I am a huge super man fan and grew up on DC comics, however my husband is a marvel fan so we first bought the marvel version of this game and then this one. I have to say marvel put it together alot nicer then this one, and easier to understand. There are a few bonuses to this game, but i wont ruin it for you. Over all it was a blast to play but marvel would have gotten 5 stars"
1,Second-Rate Game,"This is simply a second-rate game, a pretender, a wannabe. It simply reeks of rush job made to cash in on the super-hero craze. You battle through hordes and hordes of robots. It feels more like a chore rather than fun. The super-heroes themselves blend in with the other enemies so that you can't see them amongst the hordes and hordes of robots. Then the game ends. No special cut-scenes. Just screen credits. That after working hard to clean the screen of robots. To add insult to this whole thing the game is very short. Don't waste your money on this rubbish. Take it from me, once you've played the other super-hero games you will see how really bad this one is. Save a little bit more and get the real game. Don't waste your money on this game. Show the game developers that you don't like being ripped off by games like this."
2,fun but familiar,"kind of fun but very similar to other games ,like Marvel Ultimate Alliance, except with smaller mission teams(with less controller change options) and NO team member choice options, which is the biggest game flaw. plus the voice acting, while well done, is flawed"
3,it's ok,This game is just ok. You just walk around and punch people. This kinda game is for little kids. Adults would get bored of it really quickly.
4,My son loves this game.,"He beat the game so quickly, however. It didn't seem challenging enough for him. My son turned 12 in March."
3,All Done!,"I got this game when it first came out, and I've already finished it. By no means am I a gamer, but this game was not challenging at all. You would think that the powerhouse superheroes like SuperMan and Wonder Woman would be tougher. I was able to beat the bosses without dying once. This game was a big dissapointment. At least Marvel Alliance comes out tomorrow!"
4,Was expecting more and better decisions by Snowblind,"This is a very good game overall. Great graphics, individual superhero powers, interactive environments etc. However there are some major drawbacks. First, certain main characters are missing like Aquaman and Hawkgirl; while a minor character (Zatanna) is included. Also, you cannot select the character you want - I was really disappointed and surprised."
3,Underwhelming,"For all the pre-release talk about how this game was going to try and make each hero both distinctive and evocative of their comic-book inspiration, this game is basically a reskinning of a standard-issue arcade punch-and-shoot-em-up. Superman can fly, technically, but really what he does is sort of hover and geriatrically creep forward through the air. Batman and Superman take the exact same amount of damage from getting punched in the face by the same robot. And so on. For someone who hasn't played this sort of game before and really likes DC Comics, it's a decent enough effort. (My five-year old thinks it is fun.) For anyone who had even modestly higher expectations, it's a disappointment."
2,beginner beware,"This was my first pilates video. It is sooooooo boring. I did the exercise for a couple minutes, and never picked up this video again. It was a waste of money. If your a beginner, it's great to start slow, but this video made me not want to do pilates...it was just that boring."
5,Very Good,"I have been using another video from the instructor for a few months and really enjoy it, so I decided to add Pilates to what I do with her.Good instruction on this one also and is a nice supplement which helps focus on my abs to strengthen them more."
5,Wonderful Introduction To Pilates,This is a smart video in making it easy to follow along as a beginner to Pilates. The easier level presents the moves in a modified and slower form than other beginner DVDs I have tried which made it easier for me to learn the moves and follow along. I have been using this now for a little over a month and have been very pleased with the purchase. Looking forward to trying the other material on it some more when I progress further.
5,Learn & Progress,My friend suggested I may like pilates as an exercise to supplement some other things I have recently started (yoga and some weights) and recommended this DVD.The instruction is clear and there is a set of lessons/routines for someone just starting out and routines that are more challenging when you improve upon the beginning level. You can even feel the effects of the more beginner level by following the instructions. The correct postures work wonders.Beautiful setting and the instructor is encouraging and engaging in demeanor.
2,Sorry I bought this DVD,It's hard to see what the instructor is doing because there's only one camera angle- no close-ups or different angles. The abdomen exercises were pointless. I couldn't see what she was doing with her stomach because there wasn't a close up. Maybe this is because it was made in 2006?
3,not totally for beginners....,"I find this video to be frustrating because of her expecting me to able to do some of the most basic moves and her instructions for the moves go to fast. But expecting a video to be geared to my level is probably, at best, completely unrealistic. That said some of the things I like about this video are there are different levels at which to start and she does a lot of explaining in the beginning about what Pilates is all about. I guess maybe I need pre-pilates like young kids need pre-school."
1,Too Easy!,"I bought this dvd since I am new to pilates, but have been doing Bikram yoga for nearly 2 years. I wanted a different workout. All I can say is this video is boring. I went thru it once, and put it away. I did not feel like I had ""worked out"" at all. It's probably better for someone who's just starting a work out routine. If you've done any yoga at all, this video is not for you."
1,lame,anyone and I mean anyone can do this workout! Don't waste your time on these beginner's pilates dvds.....way to easy. I suggest winsor pilates if you want real results!!
3,Do not expect much,"After reading the reviews, I expected alot from this DVD.However, do not expect too much.Since this is for the beginners, this has only easy work outs."
4,True Beginner Fun,"Pilates for Beginners truly seems to be a video directed toward beginners in pilates. Sometimes videos say that but do not mean it. I've really enjoyed learning the basics and have found it to be a good workout, even if it goes at a slower pace."
5,Very Good,"A nice selection of workouts with two levels (easier then a bit more harder) that is fun to workout with has made this a very good dvd for me. I really like the instructor, very nice and is able to teach well for beginners."
2,just ok,Although this video may appeal to some I found it very dated. After viewing some more exercise shows (on demand for ex) I feel I could have saved the $ cause I prefer the more up to date shows! Therefore...just OK!(at best)
3,Okay - for a brief Introduction,"After scouring reviews on beginner's Pilates DVDs, I ordered this one. I've never done Pilates before, and I would say that it is a decent intro to Pilates if you fall into that category. I found it difficult to actually build a routine around this DVD, however. She goes into quite a bit of explanation, which is good for the first couple of times. However, the routines are very slow due to the explanations (which you can't turn off) and it became tedious to hold a position to wait for her to finish the explanation of the move before moving on. So, after becoming more familiar with Pilates, I ordered Brooke Siler's Beginning Pilates for Weight Loss, which I absolutely love."
2,Not clear enough for a Pilates newbie,"I've never done pilates in my life, so I bought this dvd based on the reviews of everyone saying how great the instruction was for beginners. However, I didn't find the instruction to be very clear at all, and she explains everything so quickly that I constantly had to stop, pause, rewind, and review. I'm still interested in learning pilates, but I just found this dvd to be incredibly frustrating."
3,OKAY WORKOUT,"I bought this video because of all the great reviews. It's an okay workout but nothing to really rave about. I am new to pilates and have only worked out twice with this DVD but I see in the future how this DVD might get boring. I thought I might like all the combinations this DVD has to offer. For example it has arms only, legs only, ect. But I find myself just wanting a really good pilates routine. It does have one but it is only 35 minutes. Bottom line, I like the DVD but it's not the greatest."
3,Instructions are given too quickly,"The beach setting and sound of waves is a nice touch, but I couldhave used some more detailed and slower demonstrations of the movesin the ""Getting Started"" section. It's hard to see exactly whatshe's doing. I think if you already knew Pilates, this would bea good way to do it at home, but it's not really for beginners."
3,Not that good,"Coming from thePilates Workout for DummiesDVD I expected this one to be nicer, but I didn't like the instructor too much, and the different 15 minutes routines repeat many exercises, so it gets difficult to get a continuous, varied workout."
2,"Too slow, boring, draggy","Pros: I like it that this dvd is divided by sections, times and the type of exercise viewer wants to get as well as the option to choose all inclusive, full length one.Cons: The exercises are waaaay to slow, even for beginners (i.e. it takes forever to teach one posture or movement).It is extremely boring. The explanation is way too long to the point it is hard to hold the pose while waiting for explanation to end. I wish they just taught what to do all at once and allow the viewers to check themselves as they repeat the movement.Overall: This DVD is quite boring, that I didn't even wanna try again after the 1st try."
2,Not for me,"I ordered this video because of all the nice comments it received. I did not like it. There is too much talking between the workouts and I got bored really quickly. This may be good for someone who need lots and lots of instruction, but it's not for me."
5,The Best Pilates DVD Ever!,"I never thought I'd be able to learn to do Pilates with a DVD but this one is so easy to follow and moves so appropriately from begginer with no knowledge to intermediate level.. it is been fantastic. Maggie Rhoades is a great teacher. Her DVD is truly one of the best I've ever found. My core strength has improved 100% since I've started using this dvd. I am more flexible and have found that in my ability - strength-wise and balance-wise has greatly improved now in other sports as well. I would not hesitate to recommend this dvd to anyone interested in doing Pilates at home. (Just an aside, Maggie Rhoades has a beautiful and soothing voice and is a pleasure to listen to as well as to watch)."
5,"Great, easy to learn workout",I really enjoy this DVD. The routines are easily learned and the pace is perfect. This is by far the best Pilates DVD I own.
2,Pilates tape,Did not do a good job of inspiring me and must of been to hard for the beginner as I didn't continued to try to use it.
4,Perfect for Beginners!,I have never done pilates before and wanted to try to find something to help my back pain. This was an easy to follow video and great for beginners. The time goes by fast and I found myself looking forward to doing the video again!
2,Hard to follow - not for beginners,I bought this thinking it would help me to have a better posture while doing pilates but it was disappointing. I thought it was a class setting instead it is just the instructor doing the exercises with a voice over explaining what is happening. I have had to resort watching videos on ehow to figure out how to position myself and breathe properly while doing pilates. It was a big disappointment. It should have been titled pilates for intermediaries.
5,Even my dog likes it...,"When I need a break from the ""serious news""I turn to this book.Bob's take on things is indeed a chuckle.My dog is quite amused whenI laugh out loud to my favorite passages."
1,See The Burton Ultralite Golf Bag,"I looked at this first because it was cheap, but that's about it. It isn't functional.Essentially, it's an empty sack that clips onto your golf bag. Your clubs remain in your golf bag. Throughout your day of golf, you have to constantly pull your clubs from your bag and insert them into this thing when you want to use it. When you return to your cart, you have to put your clubs BACK INTO your golf bag because this is not designed to contain your clubs while attached to your bag. TOO MUCH WORK! So I moved on... and bought the Burton Ultralite Bag, also on Amazon.The Burton Ultralite golf bag provides everything that this item claims, and more. Spend the extra $14.00 you won't be disappointed!"
5,EXPLODE with Peter Blast!,"I got this CD and its very good. This is Peter's second solo CD and each song is well produced and written from the heart.Check it out. After I got it, I really got into Peter Blast. Explode was released in 04 and re-released in 09 that says something in itself."
4,Political Animal,I really enjoyed this book. It gave me an insiders look at what goes on during a political campaign. I found Ben a endearing progtagonist as he tried to find love and deal with his disllusionment with the political proce
4,Alternate history,"The concept of this book was very intriguing, so I purchased it. The main idea was that the Black Death in the Middle Ages decimated Western Europe, leaving the world to be divided between the Moslems and the Chinese. I expected a rather straightforward history based upon this premise, so I was rather surprised to get a very long book that dealt with the history almost as an afterthought. The main function seemed to be concentrated on the idea of reincarnation, and various religious and philosophical concepts. There was just too much of that, and too little story to make this work consistently interesting. The last section, for example, I found entirely superfluous. That being said, the writing was very well done, and the characterizations excellent. It's not the book it purports to be, so be warned in advance. You may like it, or you may hate it."
3,Take notes as you read ...,"Problems: Loooong novel, and so sweeping that it is very hard to remember the characters and their relationships as you leap along in time. At times the interminable detailed personal discussions between characters become wearying, and I skimmed paragraphs or even pages. And last, it was not what I expected: more interpersonal stuff than historical stuff.Virtues: Really neat characters, including an African slave-eunuch, feminist Islamic women, a Japanese explorer who joins a native [North-American] society, a protective tiger. Wonderful ideas, including the encounters in the bardo, the place of waiting and judgement between lives. I loved the ending!A good book, but not in a hurry."
1,"Tedious, Boring, Doorstop Preachy","Tedious- Boring- Doorstop- Preachy. I picked these four words from reviews I agree with to get right to the heart of the matter. I was really looking forward to reading this book, it combines reincarnation fantasy with alternative history, two of my favorite flavors, but in this combo they don't taste great together. I'm just sorry I wasted a good Christmas gift certificate on it. After reading reviews from like minded readers I refuse to read any further. So if you are considering this book, please let me save you the trouble that I have put myself to by not reading these reviews first. Don't be fooled by this book, just when it starts to pick up for a few pages after tedious boring endless descriptions, you are sucked back into the dulldroms. Forget it. Don't waste your precious time. I think I'll regift this book and pass it on to a friend who actually likes tedious boring pretentious [books]."
1,Not up to snuff,"I too was disappointed. The premise was interesting, but the re-incarnation aspect left me bored. It could have gone in a multitude of better directions."
1,east is no better than west!!,"I don't think the world without christian europe would be so much better that it turned out to be in the book. The islamic, Buddhist and hinduist philosophy is very anti individualistic. It does not encourage freedom of thought, full emancipation of women, and other concepts that revolutionnized humanity because of the preeminence of christian europe."
1,This is not science fiction,"I don't understand how Robinson's books can be considered science fiction. Granted they are usually set on another planet (Mars) or in another time (Middle Ages), but there is virtually no science in them and they are almost completely socio-political speculative fiction.Is Robinson emblematic of what's happen to the Hugo and the Nebula Awards? Have the social, political, speculative, fantasy-fiction crowd taken over? Is this why the widely-read sci-fi writers of the last decade have been ignored? Whose stacking the vote at the Hugos and Nebulas and why?"
5,a beautiful novel,"I loved KSR's Mars novels, but I had to admit that Robinson tended to let things drag at times with long ramblings on various topics--good ramblings, but sometimes I just wanted to skip ahead and get back to the interactions of the wonderful characters. (I *love* KSR's characters!) The Years of Rice and Salt has all the good points of the Mars books--deep characters you can fall in love with, grand visions of entirely possible utopias, and yes, philosophical rambling--but not *overly long* ramblings. The Years of Rice and Salt ranks with the Mars books as SF novels about which you don't have to say, ""It's good...for an SF novel."" Nope, this is just plain good."
3,Great for those with INSOMIA,Book was a disappointment though I read the book from beginning to end. The early chapter was interesting then the author started drifting with too much fluff and pratically put me to sleep. It was't near the tail end of the book did it get interesting again. Its a good book if you have insomia...
4,Very intriguing,"Using a running thread of reincarnating characters whose incarnations conveniently always begin with the same letter, Robinson traces the history of our world as it might've been without the influence of the European worldview. Islamic and Asian philosphies instead shape the development of the world and the discovery of the New World. This is a challenging read, not one quickly read. For my own part, I split the book in half, taking a break in order to cogitate on what had happened. It's also slow to get interesting. Indeed, I didn't start getting absorbed in Robinson's history until they discovered what we call America. If you feel the same entering into this work, I encourage you to continue and finish the book as it presents a fascinating portrait of what might've been. Full of insights and philosophical discussions, this book quietly enters into my highly recommended list."
2,Disappointing Novel,"Although I really enjoy KSR's work, The Years of Rice and Salt just didn't do it for me. It is a brilliant idea, but the follow-through was poor at best. The world that Robinson creates ends up basically the same as our own world instead of the drastic alternate past/future novel he could have made, it's as though everything is inevitable and merely channeled through different inventors/rulers/politicos. I guess if that's the message of the novel then it's good, but I was hoping for something with more imagination."
2,Boring and incoherent,"The topic of this book is what would the world look like if European civilization never came to be? The author imagines a world where Europe was wiped out in the Black death. But then much of his imagination stops. Finally the world develops in about the same way as it has actually done, but in the Far East instead. You can learn a few facts about the history of Islam and Buddhism, the only merit of the book which is mainly boring and without any plot whatsoever. And the interludes in the ""bardo"" where the main characteres are reincarnated is a disturbing ingredient which add nothing to the continuity of the story. I think his Mars trilogy was much better."
1,"Shoot the editor, retire the author.","This was painful to read, poorly written, rambling, and largely uninteresting.The main characters keep changing as they are reincarnated, so even character development is poor. It's a bogus world history of religious and race wars, injustice, etc, with characters you don't care about. It was an interesting premise, very poorly written.It's a shame that the editor didn't have the balls to tell the author try again. No way would this have ever been published if it had been his first book. Robinson has done some awesome writing, and I'm a fan, but this should never have been published.This is NOT science fiction. It's crap."
3,Conversational style ruins it,The chapters often end with an aside style commen by the author that is so glaringly conversational that it ruins the story. The actual plot is interesting
2,What a shame. Waste of a great concept,"The first 1/2 of this book was pretty darn good. I really liked the stories that revolved around the discovery of physics, the new world, etc. Unfortunately these were far too short, and as the book dragged on, the chapters seemed to get longer, the discourses on politics and religion got more prevalent, the characters got more one-dimensional.Frankly, this book comes grinding to and stuttering halt. Such a shame too, great premise and good start. Avoid it."
2,Over my head,"I didn't get the point of this book by 150 pages, so I gave up. Some may say that's too soon, but if it's not compelling by then, what's the point? Some friends of mine say they enjoyed it. It led to discussions on whether the author was trying to say various things about society. I don't think the author was trying to say any of those things, but if it's a good starting point for conversation, that's a plus, at least."
5,An Entertaining and Thought-provoking Masterpiece,"This is how good novels can be. Robinson's talent and range are amazing. He is doing some of the best work of any author in any genre in America today. His take on a world that develops without domination by Europe is fascinating, entertaining, and sometimes, disturbing. His insights are not simplistic and predictable. Great book!!"
4,"Strong book, disappointing ending","I thought the book was excellent, particularily the second half. Robinson is a pretty liberal guy, I expected that the Islamic empire would be treated in a very P.C. style (such as, making them very peaceful and kind, with the implication being that Christian Europe forced them to be violent), but that's not what happened. The big war ends up with the Islamic world treated like Nazi germany (experimenting on Jews, Christians...).The end was kind of disappointing, as there was no big grand finale to the story. I guess thats sort of like history though."
3,Makes one long for the bardo,"An interesting idea -- non-Eurocentric world development told from an Eastern on-going perspective of continually reincarnated entities. Unfortunately, it is entirely too long and without conventional (real time) points of reference it makes it difficult to compare what happens with what really happened. It also has a disturbingly anti-Muslim bent as if without European Christianity the world would be dominated by violent oppressive Islam and existential Buddhism. The idea that half the world would be dominated by one united religious realm rather than fragment into many different religious/political sects (as in the real world) is a stretch. I would have liked also to have seen more about the North American development."
1,The Emperor's New Clothes,"This book appears to be written for eight year olds. The sky was ""big."" The cloud was ""big."" The building was ""big."" It's like The Little Golden Book of Alternate History. The characters are so childishly stated as to be non-existent, and as to Robinson's purportedly brilliant insights into other cultures, you could learn more about the Arabs by holding a bowl of humus and thinking about sand. If one is to believe the forecast reviews, this is one of the great works of our time. Read the sample pages and you'll see that the emperor isn't wearing any clothes. A terrible, almost unreadable book."
3,Years of Pork and Wine?,"I enjoyed The Years of Rice and Salt, but it contains some flaws that will subtract from this enjoyment for some.The first occurs when the Muslim Emperor Ackbar is served shredded pork with curry.Uh... Oops! That's not kosher! I mean not halaal!This error is, later in the book, compounded with much wine drinking and many references to reincarnation.Mr. Robinson, PLEASE study up a bit more on your Islam!"
4,fasinating read,This is the first book I ever read of Robinson's and I found this book rich in words and stories of what if. I found myself not putting the book down. 600 and some odd pages and I read it all. Great book.
2,Inadequate,"Im sorry but this particular title does not make the cut. It's characterization is not very good, and after reading 70-odd pages I was bored."
2,Too Much Effort,"After plowing through slightly over 200 pages, I surrendered. Character after character, generation after generation, there just didn't seem to be much of a point to the meandering commentary. If an author can't generate more interest than this after 200 pages, he doesn't deserve my attention."
3,Great Promise,"I loved the idea as presented, an alternative history, what if the Black Plague had caused a 99% mortality rate? What would happen in Asia, Arabia, Europe and the New World? A fascinating premise that at times lives up to its promise, but it is inconsistent. Mr Robinson brings contemporary views to many of the scenarios and sometimes that is interesting and insightful, other times not at all. Get ready for a lot of death (of course a history of world would contain a lot) and endlessly repeating cycles (hmmm, sounds a lot like history?) yes the book had great promise but for me it failed to deliver on it. Long, convoluted passages. I repeat, long convoluted passages and when you are done, you still don't really know anyone very well. Wait for the paperback"
2,Poor attempt to mix alternate history w/ views on religion,"Saw the good reviews.. Had high expectations. The author took what could have been a great topic, and overlaid it with a metaphysical view on reincarnation. As a story mechanism, it worked ... OK.. but in the end became over used.The story pacing is Veeeery slow. Unless you are a speed reader, you will bail on the story.If you like other authors of alternate history (Turtledove, Stirling, Flint, etc..) this book is NOT for you. Kim's topics are good, but the vignettes read like molasses."
3,"Interesting plot and entertwined stories, drags on too long","The Years of Rice and Salt is quite an undertaking... how would the world have been different if the Black Plague killed off most of Europe and hence severly limiting the influence of Western Europe on the rest of the world.Robinson, as he does in his other books, is quite thorough in putting it all together into a cohesive story that is well-thought out and filled with detail and explanation. Unfortunately, it bogs this book down. I forced myself thru the last third of the book.The mini-stories that are linked together are a mixed bag. Some are a delight to read while others are mind-numbing. Discovering their link as you read the book is interesting. The chain of events is quite believeable and thought-provoking.This book is a good read but might take you a while to finish if you don't carry enough momentum into the second half of the book."
4,The good news: made me think. The bad news: goes on and on.,"I'm a big fan of the Robinson Mars books -- although sometimes they do seem to go on and on. Although Robinson is always an interesting writer, this one also seems like it sometimes could have used a good editor. However, the premise is interesting. Sometime, probably around C1400, a plague killed off Western culture. This is an alternative universe seen through the eyes of a karass of continually reincarnitaing characters (if you've read any of the other reviews, you'll probably know that each character shares an initial of the name each time they are born anew). The good news: made me think. The bad news: goes on and on."
3,Not sure what to think of this novel,"I really wanted this to be one of my favorite books. The beginning was engrossing, lyrical, and extremely immersive. The mystical turn of the novel at the end of the first chapter was wonderful, and I was deeply involved with the characters and their reincarnations in each period in history. However, like other reviewers, I found the last couple chapters to be didactic and I found myself skipping over paragraphs. I liked that the style of the chapters evolved with the time periods, but I found the end of the book to be rather dry and unsatisfying."
3,"Good idea, poor execution","The idea is so intriguing I finished the book, but I ended up disappointed. The alternate history is not enough to carry the book on its own, and the characters' continuity is not enough to keep this from being merely a series of short stories and vignettes. Many of the little stories are good, but the reincarnation theme is not enough to make us believe these are really the same souls, so that in each chapter you are learning new people in a new time.If the people were more recognizable from life to life, or even if they in fact seemed to grow and learn in the ways they discuss in the between lives Bardo, this might have worked better for me. The book is too long and stories are too variable in quality to succeed as an anthology, and the character continuity issues mean it is not a successful novel."
5,The Years of Rice and Salt,The Years of Rice and Salt is one of Robinson's best efforts. I enjoyed it much more than 40 Signs of Rain.
1,Disjointed and Disappointing,"I also found this book to be rather a bore. I like some more history to my alternate history - this was a series of character sketches revolving around Eastern religious themes with just a little history in the background. You have to read between the lines to determine what the ""historical"" message is in a section. The Widow Kang section was particularly boring - and the book draws its title from this section. After 400 pages it finally got up a little steam in the history department. By the time I finished this book I had a real love-hate relationship with it - A great idea, but not a good book. I could put this book down. It was only determination to finish what I had begun that got me to the end."
1,This book defeated me,"I threw this book in the trash the other day unfinished. I never do that but this book just defeated me.I loved Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars series and had high expectations for this book, even knowing going in that it was different in many ways.The alternative history and reincarnation aspects were sort of intriguing at first but the many stories contained in the book (due to the periodic ""reset"" of reincarnation) are boring and hard to follow. There is just too much text dedicated to mundane activities and no real plot to latch on to.The book put me to sleep more times than I can count to the point I just had to give up."
1,Not as advertised,"I bought this book based upon the authors past history such as his Mars trilogy. This book was a total disappointment. I found it boring and verbose. The description of the plot and the back cover touted it as an alternate history of the world starting in the 14th century. This was misleading description. It became almost painful to get through the last couple hundred pages, then to book just stopped. It did not come to an abrupt end, or a logical conclusion - it just stopped."
3,Didn't live up to expectations,"As an alternative history of what would have happened if Europe had been depopulated by the Black Death this book had some real possibilities. Would Islamic civilization, which was still thriving at the time, have taken the lead in the world? Or might China have rose to the challenge? Through the use of reincarnation the author attempts to explore the possibilities but never really succceeds in pulling the reader in, at least not in my case.A great idea for a book, though."
5,Great imaginative read!,"The Years of Rice and Salt is a tremendous undertaking, and if Kim Robinson does not take it as far as it can go, so what? This is still a wonderful novel of alternative history. Covering a thousand years of such unconventional history is ambitious and makes the novel work. The story centers on a few souls (who conveniently always have names beginning with the same letter) wiped out by the plague in Europe. The souls are reborn and many times make the same mistakes from prior lives. Robinson certainly has his opinions on what works in our current civilization and extrapolates these ideas into his overactive imagination. This is an interesting, imaginative book that I found quite pleasurable to read. It can be a lot of fun if you don't take it too seriously. Highly recommended..."
2,What if...?,"To enjoy this book, one needs at least a good world history course to understand the references to Chinese, Muslim and Indian history as well as a good sense of geography. It's an interesting premise: what if Asia and the Middle East had dominated world history instead of the West? It gets so bogged down in dibs and dabs of various Eastern and prehistory religions and a multitude of characters who are actually the same beings that it is easy to get lost and lose interest. Bigger and better maps both of the author's imagined world and the world we know now would have helped immensely, but this is also true of most nonfiction books."
3,hard to install w98se for axim x30/bluetooth gps,my god how long has w98se been out and it asks for the w98se installation disk--not once but twice!!!!! what the hell for!! include the cabs in the installation files. then it says connect the device--which one?? the bluetooth adapter or the device you want it to talk too---I havent finished installing the usb adapter!! 3 reboots 2 win98se disk insertions and then i have to configure 2 bluetooth devices!! i muddle through passcodes and pairing---where the hell is the instructions??? finally i run around the house with a tape measure--100meters is bs--besides i'm american its called feet. i got about 75 feet with weak signal and one of the devices caused a fatal error!! so stay within 50ft/good signal and no crashes. for 40$$ its too expensive not to get better instructions and setup.exe files.
1,Software that comes with it doesn't work.,"This one is really awful, but only because the software installer can't seem to install it properly. Not even the most recent December 2006 version of the installer works properly. If you already bought this and you only need it for bluetooth headset functionality or gps, download BlueSoleil software and make it work with that. Belkin's own software is pitifully useless.(Google ""BlueSoleil Bluetooth"".) The speed is limited to 5mb if you don't buy the software, but who cares for gps or phone?"
2,Not good for XP SP2,"Worked okay on my Dell D800 laptop running Windows 2000 but when I installed it on my Dell workstation at work running Windows XP Pro, it interfered with all my network connections... email, server access, internet, etc!! I uninstalled it and tried to re-install it several times check marking differing install options and the got the same result. All I wanted to do was transfer small files from desktop to and from my Samsung cell phone. If you are running Windows XP, I would suggest another solution other than this product."
5,Great for large ripping cuts and working alone,"This item is heavy & stable enough to stay upright when ripping long & heavy stock on a table saw. I ripped a 4' x 8' 3/4"" sheet of plywood into 1' x 8' sheets while working alone - which is very difficult to do with a single-roller stand (they tend to move and fall over when you finish the cut and the stock is in 2 pieces). Good quality rollers with plating that should hold up well."
2,Not Good for Outfeed in the Field,"Although this is well constructed, when used for a table saw outfeed table, I found that unless the rollers are exactly in line horizontally with the the work being sawed it tends to veer off of the plane of the saw blade. Since most of my work is in the field, in less than ideal conditions I found the roller set-up to be less than useful. I found the Rockwell stands with the wide lip to be the best quick set up."
2,Broken after 9 months,"I bought the Kettler Verio Mini-Stepper in early 2005 and exercised regularly for 20-25 minutes per day, 5 days per week. It is now December of 2005, and my Kettler stepper is broken. The steel arm that rests under the left-hand pedal has snapped off at the weld, rendering the machine useless. The product is rated for people up to 225 pounds, and I'm 160 pounds. I don't believe that I put any unwarranted stress on the machine either due to my weight or my exercise habits. For One-Hundred-Thirty dollars, I expect a little more longevity from an exercise machine. I think I'm ready for a solution with less propensity for breakage -- like maybe a three dollar jump rope."
4,Interesting read and insightful perspective,"This book provides a unique approach to telling the history of psychology and does a great job in tying a historical perspective of people and events. It helped me gain a greater understanding of the history of psychology. I recommend this book to anyone studying psych or has a general interest in expanding their knowledge of psychology. It can be a bit of a dry read (much like a text book), but I enjoy that style and this book kept me interested. GREAT FOR FIRST YEAR PSYCH STUDENTS!!!"
5,Informative and Deep,"Very informative history of psychology and theories of knowledge. A great value for anyone interested not only in psychology but intellectual history in general. Well constructed, excellent in style, vast in scope."
1,Do yourself a favor and RESEARCH !!!,"Ok when I went to the authors website I admit it did very much catch my attention but like any reasonable person I decided to do my own research.Please please do yourself a HUGE favor and research this man and find out for yourself what he has been a part of before you waste your money or worse take him up on his tax advice.His methods have been tried before, they do not work and can cost you even more when charged with presenting a frivolous argument.A simple google search will provide you with everything you need to make a informed choice. Just type the mans name in any search engine and look for yourself.Please do not bother in confronting me with the "" you must be a irs agent "" or any other stupid comment from Mr Hendrickson`s Fanboy club members.I am a normal hard working guy. Yes I pay taxes and yes I hate paying taxes.I hope any who read this will at least do there own research."
4,must read more then once,a lot to comprehend. a nd a lot makes sense. what makes mad is that this is true and we are not liable to pay taxes on our earnings. but how do you convince the judge and the jury? i'm angry because they(the lIRS and the judges know the truth but wont let you win in court and wont answer the question that will prove us innocent
1,For Entertainment Only,"Were it not for the author's convictions for tax related crimes, one might assume that he is among the gullible few who believe everything they read on the internet. His first chapter is a veritable smorgasbord of looney legal theories. Hendrickson manages, in that first chapter, to provide misinformation about direct and indirect taxes in general (both theory and practice), capitations, Adam Smith, the Founding Fathers, the constitution, sales taxes, excises, the Internal Revenue Code, jurisdiction in general, federal and state jurisdiction in particular, and the federal taxing power. All that in only 11 pages. The rest of the book promises to be a real hoot."
1,Handrickson was convicted for not filing a tax return,"The author of this book claims that every CPA and tax attorney you have ever known is wrong, and that he has uncovered ""the truth"" about Federal income taxation.The author of this book was also convicted in 1992 for failure to file an income tax return. Furthermore, every one of the strategies in this book for reducing or eliminating ones Federal income tax obligations that has been used in court, has failed in court.Even if you distrust the Federal government, do you really want to put your trust in this author instead?"
1,Worse than Worthless,"Don't bother getting this book. It's a load of junk. Worse than a load of junk. The advice given is bad advice and if you follow it, you will end up at best being laughed at, at worse owing the IRS MORE money in penalties and interest than when you started. You could lose your car, you could lose your house.People have already tried using the ideas in this book and they have lost in court.The statements about who is an employee and who owes taxes are dead wrong and if you follow them, you will end up owing everything you owed before plus more in penalties and interest.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK !If you need a book to help you deal with the IRS. There are far better books put out by Nolo Press including:Stand Up to the IRS,Surviving an IRS Tax AuditFight the IRS in Tax CourtandTax Savvy for Small Businesses (which helps you avoid ever needing the other three).Any of those books would be far more helpful than ""Cracking the Code"""
1,Old News,"There is nothing in this book that is not a re-hash of old, worn-out, tax-protestor garbage culled from numerous other de-bunked and discredited works regarding the legality and legitimacy of the income tax.This book is a complete work of fiction and should be regarded as such by any conscientious American."
1,A book that target markets the gullible and uneducated,"Anyone who relies on this nonsense risks fines, penalties, and even prison time."
3,For The Control Freak,"If your goal in a table tennis game is to land your ball on the table in the area where you want it to land then this is a paddle that may give you the defensive return to do so, a little speed glue might help too. The Tackifire rubber and the odd shape of the blade with the addition of a different rounded type anatomic hold makes this model diferent fron the Pro Series Line. Honestly, this is the least used racket on my Butterfly collection. Needs an extra 'umph' to get a little speed, good for the defensive choppers."
5,A Very Helpful Overview of Litigation,"This book covers both the skills used in the courtroom and lawyering skills needed to deal with clients and opposing counsel prior to trial. The book gives the law student an overview of the entire legal process from getting a client to winning at trial. The book has humorous anecdotes throughout and the examples are helpful. One overlooked answer to many problems that cause conflicts is addressed here (""Disputes about Deals""), a client in a business dispute sometimes simply has to admit a mistake and say, ""I'm sorry.""Hegland uses his wit and skill as a law professor to teach beginning lawyers practical skills and share insights so they will have the skills to communicate better with their clients and be successful in the courtroom. This book appears to have evolved into a more recent nutshell, Trial and Clinical Skills by the same author. There is no need to buy both."
3,Great music -- Weak Vocals,"This, Akacia's third album, shows that nothing has changed. Mike Tenenbaum's guitar playing is excellent as is Doug Meadows drumming and Steve Stortz Bass. Trish Lee is fine on the keys. The problem is still the vocals. They just aren't very good. Eric Naylor's voice doesn't fit the music and at times he even gets slighty off key or flat. The writing is superb, but the vocals seem to take away from what the music wants to be."
4,"Akacia: This Fading Time (2006) - 3,6 stars","Akacia offers up a solid collection of retro music on their third release. By no means perfect, but solid.With a soundscape solid based in 70's music, and with touches of jazz, psychedelic rock, early hard rock and symphonic rock being thrown together on this release, the end result is rather original sounding. And of high quality as well.But as the mix above will cater to a rather selected audience; this isn't a release that will go down in history - the potential sales here are just too limited I'm afraid.Still it's clearly worthwhile checking out for the curious, as there are quite a few nice tracks on this release."
5,"Great part, horrible packaging","The good: it arrived on time, fits my 2000 Explorer Eddie Bauer and works like a charm. The bad: it was a miracle that it arrived unbroken: the part arrived wrapped in a cloth sack inside a thin cardboard box, no other packing. That box was shipped in a huge 5 cubic foot carton containing only 4 pages of crumpled newspaper. This could easily have been a very negative experience."
3,if you are looking for a devils lake substitute.....,"I purchased this book to complement my guide to devils lake. I dont think this book really added anything extra or of worth. Even If I didnt have the devils lake specific book, the maps and descrptions for routes are hard to follow"
5,"Nice drama, I love it...","I like Korean's drama. With this one in particular,is important to me, because my husband is not a fan to watch TV, and he doesn't like soap operas or how we say in Spanish ""novelas"". But this drama he love it. He was in front of the TV everyday just to watch the drama. This was the 3rd drama that I saw, and one of my favorites. In total I thing I already watch between 5 to 8 Korean dramas. I just love it!!!"
4,A Funny Korean Series,"Really funny and interesting. Not as great as Full House of Autumn in My Heart, but still a very good product."
5,So cute!,"I think this is the most interesting miniseries I have watched ion a while. It's so cute and although the ending wasn't as I would have written it, There was the hint that a second season was to follow which never did. I still love to watch it though."
3,Sweet and Gentle,"This is a sweet and gentle tale of 3 elderly women who have the courage to begin to live again after their lives have become empty of relationships and activities. They find themselves pretty much alone and without much purpose in life and develop a unique and beautiful friendship that rejuvinates their spirits and allows them to ove forward. It is slow moving and the kind of book one might pick up and put down again before finishing the whole thing. It moves at a gentle and meandering pace and while it does pique one's interest and we want to see how each story turns out, it's certainly not a page burner."
1,Kindle readers warning,"This is not formatted for kindle. The so-called Kindle edition is just a horrible scan of a paperback. I really wanted to read this book and almost bought it without downloading the sample. The publisher should be ashamed of attempting to sell this as a Kindle version. This scan of a paperback is so sloppy that it's complete with a warning to not buy without the cover. Even the barcode and the price of the paperback was scanned in and is good for a laugh. Ironically, at $6.99 the paperback was cheaper than this poorly scanned, faded Kindle version. Download the sample for laughs, but don't waste money to buy it for Kindle."
5,Ladies of Covinton Send Their Love,"This is the first of a series...the lives and adventures of the Covington women are wonderful, believable, and something all women over 50 can relate to."
2,"A New Age ""Mitford"" Book","Joan Medlicott has taken the same setting (North Carolina Mts) and develops a continuing story of 3 women in their late 60's who make a new home together amongst the ""native"" NC people.This book & the 2 that follow show adultery, gays, and challenging Christianity in a ""positive"" light.The 3rd in the series begins to tell about one of the character's ""out of body experiences"". This author has copied a previous best seller series(Mitford) and put in her ""new age philosophies"". --it is so obvious what this author has done--and gotten away with it ! Sad!!!"
2,Lack of quality is offensive,"Add me to the list of readers who are offended by the very shoddy editing of this Kindle edition of ""The Ladies of Covington."" Electronic publication is cheaper for the publisher, so why can't they provide something that doesn't look like it was written on a broken keyboard. I have just deleted 4 'Covington' books from my Amazon wish list."
5,The Ladies of Covington Send Their Love,"I just finished reading The Ladies of Covington Send Their Love. I loved it. I fell in love with all the characters-Grace especially. I read it in two days. It was peaceful. uplifting, and the three ladies all had incredible depth. Their memories and quirks made them more real and lovable. I am recommending it to all my friends as a Mother's Day gift. Toby Mueller"
3,A bit dull..,This book was ok but you can guess what is going to happen and that forever is a turn off of reading for me. I don't agree with the views in this book but read on because I longed to sit on that darn porch!
2,"The ""Me-First "" Generation.","Although I admire some facets of these women's (can't bring myself to call them ladies) personalities but I can not say that I like them. They show that the ME FIRST generation is not limited to those under 30. If you are looking for a Christian read, this is not it. God to these women has no real meaning or place in their lives. I was terribly mislead by a professional reviewer who cited Jan Karon. Sorry I wasted my money. In the future I will read the readers reviews more carefully!!!"
1,"The new- ""politically correct""- Mitford book","I found this book so similar to Jan Karon's novels because it delt mostly with the day to day lives of ""senior citizens"" living in the beautiful NC mountains--except the main characters in THIS book are all women and topics such as sex outside of marriage, gay relatives, and a ""new age"" faith /religious type attitude or no belief in God is ""par for the course"" for these ladies. The writing style is very captivating, but I just wanted to go get one my Mitford books to get back to ""traditional values""--and not accept ""situational ethics"" portrayed in this book.I won't continue with this series. Jan Karon come back !"
3,Not much more than nice,Ladies of Covington isn't exactly a page turner. I doubt anyone under the age of 40 would enjoy it. It was a nice easy read though and a glimpse into the lives of who could be any aging person you come into contact with everyday. It was a simple reminder that when you reach a certain age you don't quit feeling and you can still be frightened by the future. I admired the respect three women with very different personalitys and pasts had for each other but it seemed a little unrealistic to me. The women I know in that age bracket are a little more set in their ways and I can't imagine any of them living together in one household so harmoniously.
4,If you love maeve binchy,"you will love this book. written by a new author, it is a compelling and warm story about three women in their mid 60's + who believe they have lost life and are resigned to an assisted living home with a Dicken type life controller. Any baby boomer who is looking ahead will feel lots of hope and a renewed interest in life. Highly recommended."
2,Not Mitford or Miss Julia,"I decided to try the Covington books because they were supposed to be in the same vein as Jan Karon's Mitford and Ann B. Ross' Miss Julia books. I am a huge Mitford fan, with the Miss Julia books being some of my next favorites.The Covington books have a good potential story line, but the characters are very two dimensional and spend lots of time discussing trivial things. I found the dialogue to bounce around a bit, and some of the character's thoughts and actions seem to come out of nowhere, without sufficient background or detail being laid.Frankly, I also missed having some humor in the story line, though there are ample places that it could have been incorporated. I guess this is consistent with the ""flat"" feeling I had about these books."
2,It was OK.,"If you are looking for a real page turner, this is definitly not your book. It is a nice slooooow moving story about three older women who go out on their own. It was extremely predictable, and had very few exciting moments. Unlike my friends I did not fall in love with any of the characters, I found them annoying(Amelia)and extremely self centered(Hannah). If you liked the Mitford series your gonna love this one. Just make sure you pump a lot of stong coffee into your system before you settle down with this book!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY FOR KINDLE,"This is a great book.However, everyone who owns this thing on Kindle knows that this is NOT a Kindle book (despite the advertising). It doesn't open correctly, doesn't download easily, causes the Kindle to freeze, causes the Kindle to stop working, just plain DOES NOT WORK, and all it does it causes many problems for you and your machine.DO NOT BUY FOR KINDLE until they fix this mess."
4,The Ladies of Covington Send Their Love,"I love the Ladies of Covington and the special friendship they share. Hannah, Grace, and Amelia are very different ladies and unique in their own way. This is a story of making something worthwhile work, for all of them, and certainly a story that most ladies in their senior years will be able to identify with. I look forward to reading the next book."
5,A book to curl up and go away for a day,"I have read all the series and can't wait for the next one. I read these books and wish I was living across the road from the farmhouse. I was sad when the farmhouse was ruined but glad they rebuilt and got on with their lives...I love the books, the recipes and the everyday lives of all 3..I think I am Grace."
3,Automotive Paint Handbook,"Review: ""Automotive Paint Handbook"", John PfanstiehlThis book presents a comprehensive overview of automotive finishing and includes the historical progress of automotive paint systems. The book is not, however, a ""do it yourself"" help manual. The chapters on equipment, repairs, and the complete paint job are akin to a guided tour in a paint shop. The text and illustrations throughout are well organized. The arrangement of topics is logical moves from basics through the operation of a paint and body shop. I am an amateur vehicle restorer and although the book was interesting, it wasn't particularly helpful for my hobby."
4,random note...,"I've used this for all my home painting projects. Just touchups and the like, but it was quite handy as a reference.I also worked for John's company when he was finishing this up, so many of the photos were taken by me. Most of the demo work was done on the hood of a rotting Dodge Omni. We stripped it down and built the paint back up. That was probably where I learned the most. I went in not having a clue how to get a glassy finish from a spray can and left with an ""ah ha!"".For basic paint after some little fender benders, this is great."
3,Not As Reviewed,"I ordered this juicer based on the customer reviews above, unfortunately they are not accurate. This juicer is only large enough to juice lemons, as the cone is quite narrow. One of the reviews said this juicer was larger than they expected, but it was smaller than I expected, the inside diameter is only 4.5"". If you are looking for a lemon/lime juicer, this is perfect, but if you are looking for an orange juicer, keep looking."
3,Okay for smaller citrus,I got this to squeeze oranges. Much too small for that. really only good for limes or small lemons.
1,cracked while sitting on shelf,"Purchased this juicer to juice lemons, which it did.Washed it as usual in warm soapy water, dried it, and stored in cabinet.Next day heard terrible CRACK while in kitchen: juicer cracked on its own.Spout half of the top half cracked from one side to the other.Apparently extremely poor manufacturing process!Glass making is a quality operation (except this one).Time to buy a 50 year old one that hasn't cracked yet.EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. WAS A CHRISTMAS GIFT. STINKS."
2,Not so good for oranges,"Not so good for oranges!!!!!!!!This juicer is good for small lemons only, the cone shaped glass blade must be made for lemons from overseas, it does not work well with oranges or big lemons from the US.I gave it two stars(not one) just because its difficult to find another glass juicer on amazon."
4,limbsaver,This is a great item so far so good it seems to be well made.I just got this i love it brings the noise down to almost 0% and it makes your arrows 50% more accurate as it seems.There is downfall though its a little on the heavy side but still one of the best stbilizer i have ever had.
2,Not the greatest Tech Trax,"When the cars are launched into the first jump, they will not make it, and they will crash and fall apart completely (it's fun to watch them ""explode""). Then you must put them back together (which is fairly complicated), only to have the same happen again. If a Jump Master car is put on the track, it wll make the jumps, but fly over the guardrail. All the guardrails must be set up, and, as mentioned earlier, they don't all work. Your results may vary, for I did not use the manual as a measuring tool like it says so, which might get frustrating, as it is an almost too big book for that purpose (at least for the Power Swing set)."
1,Couldn't return it fast enough,My son got this for Chanukah. It was difficult to assemble: the angle of one of the turns was so severe that the pieces of track wouldn't hold together. Then once we were able to get the car past it - and only by modifying it so the turn wasn't so sharp - the jump inside the loop wouldn't line up; the car never made it through the whole course even once.Im disappointed that Mattel would put their Hot Wheels brand name on this inferior toy.
3,Fun for even the grown ups,"Even I enjoyed assembling this and playing with it. Child has to know to handle it gently since it is very flimsy, and can easily mis-align causing frequent ""crashes""."
5,Not for the technically challenged - but lots of fun.,"This is definitely not for the technically challenged. I bought it because I thought my little boy would love it, and being a Mechanical Engineer, I figured it couldn't possibly take me four hours to put together. Turn's out I was right. I had it together in less than 30 mins, it totally kick's butt, and my little guy was screaming he was having so much fun!!!As for all of the complaints, here's what I'd say:1) The engineer's at Mattel weren't crazy, they just forgot that most people don't putting like stuff together. This toy was designed by engineers, for engineers. Lot's of adjustments and tweaking are part of the fun.2) The cars are supposed to be dis-assembled and re-assembled. More tweaking - add some weight here, take some weight away there... (Don't glue the cars)."
1,don't waste your time,"DON'T EVEN BOTHER with this one. As with most parents, we give in to buying these hot wheels sets because they look cool and we have ""toy amnesia"". The only hot wheels set that has ever really worked was the fireball from a few years ago.This set took over an hour to put together and looked like it may be a neat track. However, the car does not make it through the first loop. I tried everything and it still doesn't work. So after all that effort, I will be returning this.I hope you will heed my advice and not waste your time. If you do decide to go ahead and try it for an Xmas gift, definitely give yourself time to put it together ahead of time. Happy Holidays."
4,A simple yet impressive appetizer or accompanyment to serve.,"The 50 Best Focaccia recipes is an easy to read, simple to follow guide to preparing Focaccia. With 3 methods (hand, bread machine or food processor/heavy-duty mixer), 36 variations of dough and 50 variations of toppings. A hit when served at bunko and taken in to work. Miss having pictures but can taste the Garlic, Basil and Pine Nut or the Spinach Feta, even before it is made.Use fresh herbs...that's the key."
4,Good but extremely basic,"Dr. Weil has a very sensible and holistic approach to eating which is well explained in this program. I like his emphasis on debunking fad diets and on making eating pleasurable and socially integrative. He covers all the basic concepts related to healthy eating competently and clearly. I personally was hoping for something more advanced, since the information in this video is really oriented to those who know very little about nutrition. If you have been keeping up with the literature, there will be little new information here. Actually, Dr. Weil's DVD on healthy aging contains some interesting information on healthful properties of foods and spices in the Okinawan diet which are not contained here and which were new to me. But, even if you know all this, it never hurts to reinforce it and this video is a succinct and motivational way to do so."
1,Boring,I bought this to show clients at a rehab facility I use to volunteer at. This video was very boring and most of the clients would agree. I would not recommend this product.
5,Dr.Andrew Weil's Gide to Eating Well,"love it ! it change my life .I notice big diferance in my Health and benefits of folowing his addvice is also good for my packet book !All his book I have but love DVD and he is rite Diets don't work !Folow this change of life and see the benefits in filling so good I recomend this to all my freands ,and they love it ."
5,A Wonderful Tale Told Compellingly,"This is fantastic Christmas tale (although I would read it anytime of the year) about a mysterious and elusive Newfoundland dog who saves a disabled man in a snowstorm and then disappears on his way. I agree with the other reviewer that it is certainly a real ""tearjerker"" but in a wonderful ""power of miracles"" way. The most compelling thing about the book is that the text depicts the story of the man's family awaiting his arrival on Christmas Eve, while the pictures show what is actually happening to him on this dangerous, stormy night. The art is fantastic and I find new details during every reading. My thanks to author, Frances Ward Weller, and illustrator, Robert J. Blake, for such a fabulous work."
2,Decent Card if you have the right Serial connection.,"So I'm going to keep this short, since my review is mainly based off the fact that this card cannot use a Serial to USB adapter. I didn't see the small comment made by the company that it doesn't allow the the conversion to take place, making it extremely difficult to use on a laptop or most modern computers without buying a Serial PCI card. Of course it's my fault that I didn't read everything on the product page before the purchase, but I wanted to warn others so they don't make the same mistake I did."
4,PIC Programmer & Experimenter Kit,"This kit is ok. It must be soldered by the buyer (it is not pre-built) and it does not come with the wires for the serial cable (only the connectors) as well as no power adapter, so note that you will need a soldering iron, solder, 6 strands of insulated wire, and a 12-15V 300mA power adapter to use this product. However, once its built, it works and is not very difficult to assemble. The programs and demo files on the disc with this product work well. For its price (especially in comparison to other similar products), it is a good purchase."
4,Outrageous Hollwyood characters and insight into indie film,"This is a fascinating documentary about what really goes into the making of an indie flick. The filmmaker captures Toback in all his mania- and some of it has to be seen to be believed. When it works the results are captivating and the interview footage with Woody Allen, Downey Jr., Brooke Shields, Tyson, and other luminaries goes beyond standard 'making-of' stuff and tells tales about both the film's strangely endearing subject and the interviewees themselves- all with the backdrop of making movies as a way of life. But it's Toback himself who stands out as a hustler's hustler, always with a trick up his sleeve as he actually pulls off making a real movie in 12 days... The doc's well put-together- funny, fast-moving, and packed with good tunes. Anybody interested in what goes into creating indie cinema who can embrace Toback's charming madness will enjoy this very good movie."
2,Uninformed bio,This book is subject to what so many Hollywood biographies suffer from: total ignorance on the part of the author as to how films are actually made. Authors of these kinds of books are tempermentally predisposed to disinterest in anything except gossip. What emerged from this book was a portrait of a shallow man whose career rested upon his ability to socialize. Why are so many books on film history so damned bad?
4,Lover of old traditions,"Not obvious from any information in this book is the fact that it is a revised edition with a slightly different title. Having thoroughly enjoyed the original I was interested to see what new information Martha Waterman had to impart only to be rather surprised that it was, for all intents and purposes the same. Not to be put to waste, I was able to pass it on to a friend - a recent convert to knitting and a lover of all things old."
1,I was disapointed,"I was very disapointed when I received my copy of this book, to find that most of the lovely lace patterns are printed in CHART form. I am very much against chart patterns. Anyone can read a written pattern with out having to look at a list to ask, ""What in the world does 'K' mean?"". Anyone who has spent any time with needle in hand would know. where as one must continually return to a chart to figure out what the heck a certain symbol means.If I had known this book was printed in this form I would NEVER have wasted my hard earned money on it. VERY disapointing to say the least!"
2,Traditional Knitted Lace Shawls,"This paperback book (119 pages) has only black and white pictures. It is mostly a book on knit stitches with a mere 8 patterns. She does touch briefly on the history and origin of knitting shawls. Overall, this is really more a book on how to design shawls, choosing different yarns and needle sizes and is not suited for someone who wants to be able to pick up a book; find a pattern; and know which yarn to use."
5,Marble Mania is catching!,"Marble Mania has fine photographs of every imaginable marble from pebbles found alongside streams to the Industrial Revolution in Germany & Austria. Here the cutting of agate cubes & polishing them into marbles for export all over the world became a huge cottage industry. You have to see the beauty of all the clay, pottery, crockery, china & porcelain globes. It was fun to read this big book. Found myself chatting at the local recycle shop about the blue canning jars in their windows filled with marbles. Eyeing them eagerly, with a little more knowledge & a few more names."
3,marbles are for collectors,you really have to be a full time avid collector to enjoy this book you mite want start on some thing a bit cheeper.
3,"A text book, Interesting Information","This is a good text book, it is informative, quite interesting and easy to handle, (size wise),get the workbook that goes along with it! A must! I plan on reading the WHOLE book, for my pleasure, and for more information, that which can be applied to everyday living. You will look at the word ARGUEMENT in a whole new light!"
5,Good startingpoint,"This book freshened me up on relational databases, which is essential for understanding sql7. after this book you can just use a cram-book for preparing for the 70-128 exam (NOT the exam cram for administering sql7 from coriolis! ) unless you need a studyguide with hands-on labs. i didnt find it to be a problem that this book is written on beta3, if you cant sort it out because of that then you have an attitudepreoblem or you are a spoiled kid. if so, ask mommy for help with your sql-studies.I learned advanced Access in a different language than english and this book helped me with some of the english DB-terminology. Im taking the test next week, my 7th MS-test, this book has saved me for weeks of studytime by pointing out the basic direction right from the begining."
1,SQL 7.0 BETA for dummies,"This book is obviously written on the author's work on the Beta version of SQL 7.0. Unfortunately Microsoft has changed several things from the beta to the final release, which makes this book a poor buy. At least if you were planning on leaning how to install a SQL server, then your money is absolutely wasted..."
2,I must really be a Dummy,"I'm new to SQL/SQL Server, and was looking for a basic intro to the package. The book does an excellent job introducing all of the features and functions, but not much else. Real-world examples were there, but very limited. As I read, I often found myself asking, in a manner of speaking, ""sure, that's what button I push, but WHY do I push it?""I did walk away with an appreciation for the complexity of SQL Server 7. Save yourself the cash, and read the product documentation instead."
3,"Weak, very weak","Whilst this book is a good start for a person who knows all but nothing about SQL, it only touches the surface. By no means use this as your only book. If you know a little bit about SQL, then steer clear. Otherwise, use it as a stepping stone, but be prepared to spend more on other titles."
2,Too much documentation rehash; not enough concepts/explanati,"I was disappointed with this book. Many trade books that are the first out to cover cutting edge topics merely take the documentation and present it a little differently (i.e. ""To use this feature, first click this, then enter this, now do this."" etc.) IMHO, there is too much of this in this book. Also, there is not enough explanations of the features of SQL Server 7.0 to help you understand them or how they could be used. This is the first Dummies book I have been disappointed with."
2,Very disappointed with this book,"I bought this book hoping that I could get my feet wet with SQL 7 and then get into more detail with the SQL Book Online. This book offers little more than screen shots and it does not help you gain an understanding of database concepts. If you need to administer SQL or develop with SQL, you're better off with a more complete book. I bought Using SQL Server 7.0 from QUE and am pleased with it."
3,Not real Comfortable,I bought this because I needed some comfort but the product was a little thin. I did recieve it on time and the overall quality is good though.
3,Disability awareness,"This book is one in a series. Each book has Teacher Tips and resources at the back as well as a quiz, I always find these useful. I find it a bit too ""medical"" but might be good as a read aloud to a class and could be helpful for kids to learn signs of when kids are ""low""."
3,okay... for first time exposure,"I was excited to see any children's book about diabetes, and the intent of this book is very good. But after reading it I felt that it was a little behind the times. It tells classmates you can't catch diabetes by touching the person, and states too clearly that you cannot get diabetes by eating too many sweets. That statement is too general and may mislead some less educated individuals. In truth- you can push your system to being Type 2 diabetic by having a diet too high in refined carbs. Whereas it would be true to say that you cannot get Type 1 diabetes (which is most likely what a child would have) by ""eating too many sweets"". I chose not to share this book with our diabetic child nor suggest it be taken to school. It may be better for a younger child or less exposed group of students/teachers."
5,This animal is a keeper,I bought this because I did not know everything about auctions. However as was not going to buy a pig in a poke. The first thing going for it was the fact that I watched Leslie weekly on HGTV and this has helped me many times. Secondly I opened to the sections that I already feel comfortable with such as books and glass. She knew what I knew.Now that I have read this book ad applied some of its principles I can tell you that it is a keeper. If you already know the subject it is nice to have it restated in a different way. If you do not know the subject you can live on every word she says. There are very few color plats in the book; yet the descriptions are so clear that color plates are not necessary.Even online auctions are covered and I found the fact that there are very many online auction locations not just the big three of interest. For those people that have never been to an auction this book will give them the courage and the tools needed.
4,a good panavise device,"works good, only thing would be to have either a speed adjuster, or have the adjuster work on both sides, whatever it takes to make the jaws open or close faster. but great on larger sized pcbs."
3,"Informative, but poor quality","I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for my niece, who traveled to Swaziland last summer with a Christian mission group. I was very disappointed in the poor quality of the book. The typeface was very faint in many places, and the photographs were almost impossible to make out. As far as I could tell, the information contained in the the book was accurate, but the book certainly did not produce the joy in my niece that I had hoped for when I bought it."
3,"Excellent, with caveats...","There's plenty here to get excited about, music wise. Ditto all that was said in previous reviews --this may well be the band's finest moment. Unfortunately, this edition is poorly mastered and sourced from vinyl (surface noise in the quieter parts), and on a quality sound systems with headphones, this is all very evident. A remastered edition from original master tapes is what is truly needed, but this ain't it."
1,leith,"product did not fit properly so i call for the delivery person to pick it up they claim that the product was not was not there,on the side of the house so i don't know what happen. never got back to the manufactor so i have no product nor did i get my money back. the product was nice just did not fit the chrysler pacifica thats why i give it one star"
2,"DVD unreliable, sound quality poor.","I bought this in September 2008. The DVD on this unit has always been temperamental. Often it would reject the disc repeatedly before playing it. The DVD unit now does not function at all. The sound quality is poor. The volume stays all the way to 100 and it is still difficult to hear at times (I am not hard of hearing). On the plus side, the picture quality is fine. The unit was easy to set up."
1,Bad Exerience,The TV which was received was not the one pictured in the Amazon ad nordescribed in the description. The TV received had speakers underneath and not on the sides. The ad noted that the TV had frame by frame capability which the one received did not. Discount Jungle offered a $20 refund or to take it back at my expense (over $50) I seem to be stuck with it.
1,Terrible,Do Not Buy this t.v Terrible!!! The lcd screen went! Never will buy one of their products again! Buyer beware!
1,Poor Right Out of the BOX!,"After reading the variety of reviews on Amazon I still went ahead and bought a pair. What a mistake! First I waited 24 hours for the batteries to charge, a little long bey hey, I waited patiently. Next, the base unit wouldn't turn on. Instruction said the base unit automatically turns on when the headphones are turned on. Nope. I had to unplug the base unit and plug back in to turn it on. Next, they a constant low level hissing...on every channel. And don't change headphone channels with them on your ears or you get a very LOUD popping noise. And the grand finale was they automatically shut off every 3-5 minutes. Packing them up tomorrow and shipin em back..."
4,...hmmm. No problems with mine.,"I bought these phones as an upgrade to the cheap Sony's I had been using for late night viewing. There is no comparison. The RS-65s are a superior product. You have to make sure that your receiver output doesn't saturate the transmitter circuit; I had a cheapo DVD/CD player that did just that, and even Natalie Imbruglia had a Neil Young like distortion. The unit has a very good discriminator, and noise is kept to a minimum. , I can't call these one star phones. The nature of wireless is noise. There is always a tradeoff for convenience..."
1,I agreed with all the negative reviews here.,"Unfortunately I saw them after I bought the item.The material is cheap. The sound quality is so so.If you move your head around, the static noisequickly occurs. And it keeps pressing my ears althoughI have small ears. And it costs a fountune. Pleasedo not buy it."
4,"""A sweet sounding pair""",I just recived my headphones last week and am very pleased with the quality put into the product. I'm a audio nut and can be very hard to please. The Senneiser phones are true hifi sounding headphone. I've run them through my equalizer also and that will push the sound level to the max. I like the fact that you can still here someone talk to you with them on.---But If you have big ears you might have a problem with the fit. Amazon got them to me very fast and I'm pleased with there service. Thanks ---Jeff B.--- from:New windsor Maryland
2,"very poor plastic construction, but can be fixed; bulky","Plastic pivot axes were broken after about 1 year of occasional usage. But sound is still there, range is satisfactory (not 300 feet as advertised, but sufficient for a regular house, 50 feet). Rechargable battery still works after 4-5 years no replacement, but capacity has dropped and need recharging every 2h.Because it still works I gave 2 stars. Otherwise construction is very poor. It will certainly break on you even if you do not abuse them at all. First ear peace was broken after 6 month. I fixed it with duct tape, but it did not last. So I put a metal bracket (from used computer slots) and taped both peaces. Looks ugly and bulky, but it works for last 3 years. After about one year second ear peace was broken I fixed it (you guess) same way.I doubt this product has ever passed ANY quality control. Buy only if you have spare metal brackets and know how to tape it."
2,There's a reason these are on special....,"It's because they are uncomfortable to wear.Reviewer who complained about the earpiece size and shape was right. They ride right on your earlobe and it doesn't take too long before it gets to be painful. I cleverly tried to loosen mine up a little and broke the plastic headpiece.Bad news is it doesn't look so nice, but good news is that now it doesn't hurt to wear them for awhile.Sound, etc. is just fine for most people but I wouldn't buy them again."
3,Sennheiser RS-65 wireless headphones,They are not has clear as I thought they would be. But they do the job.
1,"Bad receiption, can't move your head, high pitch noises","I read the review, still thought to give a try as it was cheap. However after using it I returned it in a week. Amazon was good to take back the product without the shipping charge.This product gives lots of noise, it will be worse if you move your head even one inch. Sometime those noise are high pitch noise, which really annoy someone, who want to concentrate for work, while avoiding outside noise.I actually took this product for my work place, where I want to do coding without outside disturbance by putting some slow instrumental song. It didn't work out, I was sitting only 3-4 feet away from the transmitter, I even tried retuning many many times.They have given one extra battery for headphone, that sits in the base station, behind the antenna."
2,Not as good as I thought.,"I bought these headphones less than a year ago. Then they quit. I only used them 2 hours per night to watch TV. I had good reception (went outside with them behind my house), while they were working. I sent them back to the factory in Old Saybrook, CT. It appeared they sent me a new set. But they only worked for a few minutes and then cut out. Try another brand."
3,Started out pretty good.....,"Ok, so it is a little over a year since I bout this, and here I am doing a review. When I bought this I did so with some caution, there were so many reviews that said negative things about this head set. I took a chance and bought the head set, and the worked pretty good for about a year, then all of a sudden things started going wrong, first the charge wouldn't hold, then then the tuner would fade in and out, and then finally they just stopped. At the beginning they were pretty decent, and they had a pretty strong connection, I could go down two floors in my house, grab a soda and still hear what was going on in the movie I was watching, or tv show I was viewing. But when things started going bad, they went bad fast. They were comfortable, light and fairly easy to use. Too bad they died as fast as they did. Now I have to find another set, and I have a feeling I may not find a set that was as comfortable as there were???"
2,Good headphones but they don't last,I have two sets of the RS 65 headphones. Each of them has a broken bracket that holds the earpiece to the headband. I thought that I stepped on one to break it but the other one definetly broke during normal use. So far I have been searching for replacement brackets online but no luck. I will call Sennheiser directly tommorrow. I paid alot for these headphones and expected longer service.We did like theses headphones very much until they broke after a year or so. Previously we had Advent headphones that we had to tweak the tuning on constantly to get reception. I am thinking about gutting the electronics out of the headphones and building a little box that I can put in my pocket and plug wired headphones into so that when they break they'll be cheap to replace.
4,"Not perfect, but works as advertised.","Overall I love these headphones, but it is important to note that they don't sound as great as the best wired headphones, but the extra freedom of movement is the entire point of these headphones.It does take a bit of thought on how to get the best sound from the headphones. Basically it boils down to keeping the signal clean and sufficient volume (but not so high that it starts to distort) before it reaches the headphone transmitter (high signal to noise ratios). Don't give a quiet signal and expect battery powered headphones to amplify it to high volumes without adding noise.Then, make use of the frequency selection. I haven't heard much static at all after finding a clear signal."
2,Cheap plastic breaks after a short period of time,"Sound quality ok. No way 300 feet, more like 75. Who ever engineered control switches must of hated home electronic fans. Switches are small and illogical. Almost impossible to control by feel(after a few months of use you will be able to control volume and on/off without removing from your head to take a look), just moronicPlastic on both sides have broken and been fixed with super glue(no other way to do at all as pieces are so minute). Super glue fails and must do again, and of course once glued the pivoting feature for ear comfort no longer works as it is glued.I think these engineers should go out and see what we chickens are eating out here before they foist their imaginative experiments on us.Anyhing else you wish to know????"
2,VOLUME INADEQUATE,I BOUGHT THE RS65 ... I AM NOT SATSFIED WITH THE VOLUME FOR A SYSTEM THAT COST ME $$$ AFTER DISCOUNT. ON DISPLAY AT THE SHOW THE VOLUME IS LOW AND YOU DO NOT GET THE CORRECT IMPRESSION. THE SURROUND SOUND IS TERRIFIC BUT I DID EXPECT MORE I.C.W THE VOLUME.I WOULD LIKE ...THE REP TOLD ME TO FIRST TURN UP THE VOLUME OF THE TV AND THEN THE HEADPHONES BUT IT DOES NOT WORK.
2,Not what I had hoped for,"I bought these to use after the rest of the family had gone to bed, so I could listed to music & watch movies without disturbing them.Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the sound to be generally perfectly fine. Unfortunately, the sound was only clear when my head was stationary. Moving around the house or even turning my head cause a lot of cracks and pops in the sound.I found this so intrusive that these went back to Amazon after only a few hours. I couldn't see the point of paying ...for headphones that made my CDs sound like they were being played on a distant radio station. I guess that this is unavoidable to some extent, given that it is a radio signal that carries the sound to the headphones, but I was appalled how bad it was.So, I guess my take-home message is that if you're considering these as your first wireless headphones, be prepared that the sound quality will not be as good as a pair that come with a cord."
4,excellent vocal duo,"Excellent vocal band that shows sweet harmonies and shine in several tracks. Unfairly ignored or neglected at their time (they only had one Singles chart entry, Ner. 25), I celebrate they are given a second opportunity to be listened, and for us to listen to them."
5,A Great Book for Everyone,"This was my first book that I bought on witchcraft, and I thought it was absolutely fantatstic. It tells you some tools you will need, along with divination rituals. I urge anyone, especially beginners, to buy this book."
4,"Great radio, great price!","Great radio, compact, yet powerful. Water resistant, subchannels and digital codes make this a practical radio. The range is reported at 5 miles, but don't expect to get that distance in urban or crowed suburbs - its closer to 1.5 miles in these areas, and clear. The only down side with this radio is the required FCC license - $75 for a 5 year license, but the GMRS is definately the way to go when compared to the FRS radios for keeping a family in touch in the larger amusment parks. The license fee is a small price to pay for the added security of the radios' range. I checked all over the web and in sporting goods stores, and Amazon.com has the best price for this pair!"
4,Nice train,"This is my first O-gauge train set. I got it to play with my 2-year old son who loves trains. He is delighted with it. He is able to operate the controls with supervision (especially the whistle), but he cannot put the train on the track or hook up the cars. The sounds are realistic, but they can get annoying. Luckily you can adjust the volume or even completely turn them off. The cars are plastic with metal wheels and running gear. They look nice, but are not as realistic as some (probably much more expensive) I've seen. The engine is all metal, and is very heavy. The train had stood up to alot more abuse than it should get."
4,very cute,the toy boxes are colorful so they're good for a boy's or girl's room. You can stack them on shelves and bookcases. The only problem is they're not as big as they look in the picture.
2,Not the best quality,The screws that hold the boxes together were not all drilled correctly. I had to glue a couple of the sides together to compensate. The boxes are fine for small toys but they don't hold much.
4,Cute and Funny,This book made me laugh. It was cute and quirky; embraces the single life and enjoy it.
1,The Title Alone Is A Turn Off,"The title ""Sex and the Single Girl"" was daring in 1962. It is now 2009. We should have moved on from calling women ""girls"" by this time."
2,Unmarried? You will enjoy this book. Single? You might want to look elsewhere.,"This is a great book for unmarried women looking for ideas on how to move through their world with a significant other and/or dating. However, this book is not for the single women. Single is different than unmarried. Single is without a significant other and/or not dating. Unmarried is not married but still dating and/or having a significant other. It may seem like nitpicking but the detail is important because the book is not written for the single woman. If you are looking for a book for women not in the dating game, ""Quirkyalone"" would be a better pick. It includes activities for people not dating and/or without a significant other. Otherwise, if you are unmarried, there are several good ideas about activities to do, people to cavort with, etc. in this book.Quirkyalone: A Manifesto for Uncompromising Romantics"
2,Not enough Substance-JUST OKAY,"I was very excited to recieve this book, and began reading it right away. About a chapter in I wasn't so excited to continue this and found it harder to pick it up. The author does give helpful advice that is fun to keep in mind when you are single and ideas for what to do with yourself. The part I personally did not care for is that half the book are stories from other singles, I found myself skimming through every story just to get to the main point paragraphs after each one. If you don't mind reading those than you will enjoy this book. But for me I want to get to the point, I want facts, and substance. I don't want to read about what Janet age 30 is doing with her single life!!"
5,Both the book and the author are fabulous,"I read the book after meeting Jerusha in San Francisco at one of her book signings. This woman is fabulous! She totally captures a room, as her book captures your imagination.About 80 people attended the book signing, 76 of which were women. I was one of only 4 men. That made me think the book was strictly for women . . . and yet it's not. Reading the book, I found it highly enjoyableI will probably never figure out women, but Jerusha's book gave me some insight into how they think . . . and did so in a highly enjoyable way.You should definitely buy the book and if you get a chance, attend one of her book signings. It will be one of the best book signings you have ever been to."
4,So helpful during tough times!,This is a great book for all ladies who have been through tough times and have lost hope for love in the future. It teaches you in a realistic and amusing way that it's okay to be single and it's okay to be with someone. It's helped myself and a few friends get through tough times. It's one I always recommend to a girlfriend in need of some hope for the future.
3,stylish replacement for my 1994 geo metro,"This passenger mirror is not a smooth concave shape, thus objects look distorted. Fitment is close, but I am temped to use a heat gun to make it hug the door better. This is a solid mirror, and I like it other than the few issues mentioned above. Feels heavy, like a good quality piece should, and has a nice black plastic polished finish. Folds in with a factory mirror feel, and my mirror adjustment stays in place, even after some hard bumps."
5,"Accurate conversion, easy to use","The product is refreshingly easy to use: you browse to the pdf you want to read, click one button, and Word opens with the converted text. The OCR is great! There only one caveat: on my order, the CD came loose in shipping and scraped around on the spindle that was supposed to be holding it. It was unreadable on receipt. Amazon sent a replacement (promptly) that also arrived with the CD loose and scratched .. but readable this time. All in all, I'm very satisfied."
4,Not perfect enough,"I don't feel it is able to recognize enough correctly.l's as i's. L as J, rn as m, e as c. These examples were scanned as 300 dpi."
5,Written in accessible and easy-to-understand terms,"Sound Recording Advice For The Home Recording Studio by John J. Volanski (an electrical and audio engineer who has operated his own home recording studio for more than 20 years) is a straightforward reference manual and instructional guide to the ins and outs of creating and operating a home sound recording studio. Focusing on the dedicated musician who may not be completely up-to-date on the latest technical jargon, Sound Recording Advice offers an invaluable series tips, tricks, and techniques for getting the most out of one's equipment. Written in accessible and easy-to-understand terms, Sound Recording Advice is very highly recommended for novice home sound recorders who aspire to professional performance standards for their work."
5,The next best thing to seeing him live,"This past weekend I had the honor of seeing Cootie live at the Mississippi Valley Blues festival and he was something to behold. If you can't see him live then this is the next best thing. Why this man has not been recognized before is hard to understand. If you are a true blues fan then this CD must be an essential album in your collection. This is NOT that rock and roll junk, this is the real deal."
4,first book,I have read many of her other books and wanted to read the first to see how. it all started and how everyone met. I was not disapointed. I enjoy this series very much and look forward to reading all of them
4,An important topic which is hard to ignore.,"At first this book bothered me with it's lack of references. Bowman would make an assertion (or state a fact, depending on your views) but not provide a reference for fact checking. Some of the government reports he quotes do not even appear in the bibliography. One example of this is when he refers to ""a 1979 government report."" Looking in the bibliography, there are no references at all from 1979. My question: ""Which report?""In spite of this recurring problem throughout the book, there are some very important points which he makes. Our country is completely reliant on energy distribution systems that are vulnerable to disruption.When I finished the book, I felt like he started out with his conclusion (the last 3 or 4 chapters) and then wrote the rest of the book to support it. This didn't work very well, but... the conclusions are important enough that I have a hard time dismissing the book as I was initially ready to do."
1,Quality control issue,"It ran too fast, it gained 7-8 minutes per hour! Unacceptable. I had a Tissot Seastar Automatic and it only gained a minute in 5 days. Was not expecting this from Seiko. I really liked the simple construction and design, I could have it's time adjusted in a jewelry store but wouldn't want to pay more when it should be working properly in first place. Not worth the time. I have to return in."
3,A Few Keys Missing,"This keyboard is functional and I am generally satisfied by it, but I should have been more attentive about the things it does not offer. Unlike current Apple keyboards, this one has no volume control keys nor an eject key. After using an Apple keyboard for some time, I have grown quite fond of those keys and miss them.Also, this keyboard came with two keys that initially did not respond to the same pressure as did the other keys. I was able - by means of mashing down quite firmly on them - to get them to respond normally and they have given me no further trouble."
4,Pretty Good,"This is pretty good keyboard, for the price, especially becuase it has two USB ports. I have an ibook, which only comes with two USB ports of its own, so having the extra two is very nice. It was pretty easy to set up too, just plug it in and your Mac pretty much does the rest. The only problem I have with this is the depth of the keys. If you are used to typing on a laptop that has shallow key depths, it takes a little time to get used to this keyboard. It doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but it does slow down my typing. But then again, I probably would have had the same problem with any other keyboards."
5,Great Keyboard,"I bought this for my wife to use with a Dell Inspiron laptop. Plugged it in and every key, except the Mac-style power key, works as it should. She likes it so much, we just ordered one for her to use at work.If you think you might like to try this product, you should order it ASAP as they are hard to find. Even Kensington has them on backorder."
5,Murder and More,"I bought this set no knowing anything about the series and was very pleased, not the best series I have ever watched, but very good. The stories are entertaining and well thought out. The series incorporates a woman detective on the rise and her family going through chaos and change. If you want a fast paced mystery series that isn't boring and has a lot to offer, this is it."
3,I love this show but...,I recommend anyone who wants to own this set to buy the UK release. It's slightly cheaper AND has subtitles. Doesn't everyone have a region free player by now? They're SO inexpensive and you don't have to wait for the whim of DVD producers to decide to release a show in region 1.[...]
3,A Little Heavy on the Gruesome Datails of Just Living,"We had no idea what to expect when we started watching this story; but quickly learned it was to be filled with the sometimes gruesome details of regular life with all of its problems and annoyances. Broken marriages, disobedient kids, too much to do with too little time to do it; it was all there in spades; this two-part story impressed me as being very hectic.Over and above that the detecting part is pretty good as newly promoted Detective Chief Inspector Janine Lewis, played by Caroline Quentin, tries to balance her responsibilities as a detective with her responsibilities as a mother. The story is fast paced and requires one concentrate on what is going on or risk losing track of what is happening.I suggest you view this one before you buy it as it does have some polarizing elements."
3,A bit much.,"The Suspect series, in my opinion, the very best; hence, this somewhat copy cat is only a three.It is quite predictable and somewhat unrealistic. A woman whith 3 children and pregnant again, and not young, going through a divorce and is suppose to be a top notch DCI. I don't think so - something has got to give. My litmus test is to keep the video and watch again - both my wife and I agreed to send this along to our British friend for her pleasure; hence, we didn't want to see it again. Bloody hell!"
3,British,"Typical british., hard to understand and the sound quality is suspect. The story line is creative and interesting."
1,Blue Murder - blu who who,"Blue Murder is perfect for those who really want a weepy soap opera, but whose significant other demands a mystery. The main character is infuriatingly bland and one wonders how or why she became a Chief Inspector, or an actress for that matter. The dialogue, such as it is, begs the question: Are you really trying to put us to sleep? You'll hear such memorable lines as (disclaimer: I made these up. Actual lines may be far worse.) ""We've got to work hard to crack this case!"" and ""Let's all work together!"" She should have added, ""And I really, really mean it!""Some of the supporting cast are wonderful and will no doubt keep you from kicking in the front of your TV. When the main character appears, use the fast forward, mate. Don't worry, you won't miss any of the plot."
3,"Good design, decent sound quality, static, no isolation","I bought these to be able to watch tv while my girlfriend is studying by my side. Connection is easy as 1-2-3. Immediately picked up the sound channel and produced nice sound. If you are into serious sound, then you should forget about wireless in the first place. You can wander around between the rooms and still have the reception. The thing i didn't like was this ""900 MHz"" technology. Just like in cordless phones there is interference and occasional noise. Funny thing - regular TV broadcast gave less noise then watching ""Run Lola Run"" on DVD. Go figure...Yes, one more thing: sitting next to me on the couch my girlfriend said that she could hear sound coming pretty clear out of external earphone covers and kept asking me to turn it down. Even she was surprised when she found out that the volume level was pretty low. I'm thinking of returning them.Good design, decent sound quality, static and no sound shield."
3,Wireless can't be perfect,"I bought this product to be able to watch tv without disturbing my wife who doesn't like background noise when she's reading. For that purpose the Sennheiser RS-45 is great. I can sit wherever and move freely without being constrained by a cord.But don't expect too much. If you move around, there will be few disturbances in reception, just as there would be if you are moving around with a portable radio. Next room the reception is not too great, so you can forget about going to the basement with the headphones if the transmitter is somewhere else.In short: if you're looking for perfect sound quality, get regular headphones with a cord. If it's more important for you that you can move around a bit, the Sennheiser RS-45 is a good option."
4,Good value--excellent for wireless,"I had a pair of Sony wireless headphones that died due to a lighting strike not too long ago. For a replacement, I immediately looked at the Sennheisers because we use their wired counterparts at work (I work as an audio technician). I am very happy with the acoustics of the RS-45--the sound is natural, the bass response appreciable (better than most large-format headphones), and, after replacing my 900MHz cordless phone (I was planning on a 2.4GHz model, anyway), static-free. The batteries only last about 4:30, but I like the base's ability to charge a second one at the same time. Overall, these are excellent wireless headphones, and reasonably good headphones overall."
2,Disappointing,"I bought these for home and work, thinking I'd be able to listen to the MP3s on my computer while roaming from room to room.Well, forget that. Despite the claims that you can hear your music through ""walls and ceilings"", the reality is that even one or two thick walls will block clear reception. And I don't know where they came up with that ""300 foot"" range for the reception, but it's just not true. In addition, the power cord and audio jack are way too short, limiting your ability to position the transmitter to where it might do some more good. If you're looking to listen to your TV or stereo from across the room, this might be the product for you, but if you want to listen to music in the backyard, you'd be better off with something else."
1,Great...until they broke,"The quality was good and all, but exaclty one month after they arrived, both ""ears"" broke off, within 2 days of each other. No way of fixing it, it's a little weak plastic part that attaches the ear to the arch. Horribly disappointing."
3,Bad instructions,"The instructions show to plug it into the headphone outlet.When I did that, the reception was terrible. Then I tried the audio line-out and it was 100% improved.The manual does not mention that. When you don't have a line-out they are junk. And the headphone is as warm as an earmuff to wear here in Hawaii. I will look for a better model."
5,there greeeeat,"i have owned the45s for three years now ,and when hooked up through you VCR you can have separate volume controls .I have found it necessary to send them in once as the ear piece broke off,the company was great to work with and I had a new pair in 5 days.I have used the same batteries for over two years .The only problem I is I would rather have a button switch for picking up the proper range rather then a small revolving control .This is only a personal opinion however.It is so pleasant to watch the television at whatever volume you desire and the wife can listen at another volume. Dealing with Sennheiser is a pleasure !!"
2,Go for the RS 110 or RS 120,"I have several RS 4 & RS 40/45 headphones.I recently purchased 2 RS 110 headphones to replace the RS 40/45.Don't bother with the older models.The RS 110 or the RS 120 is much improved.Longer range, better sound quality, better mechanical engineering, improved transmitter/receiver. The RS 110/120 uses 2xAAA alkaline or rechargeable batteries, so you can replace them when the wear out.(Don't use alkaline in the RS 120 because you may forget and put the headphones on the charging stand and cause the batteries to rupture.)"
2,Not up to par,"The auto tune function does not work very well, and the pads hurt my ears after a while."
2,Not As Good As I Had Hoped,"Although stunningly beautiful in a number of places, the videographer spent an odd extra amount of time filming bizarre things like a ship passing under a bridge, the same ship passing under other bridges, and the same ship passing under by under the helicopter. Was the ""The Ship"" video? In other areas, the videographer seems to delight in filming their landing and airport flyovers. Not exactly what I wanted to see in a video about Scotland. Numerous clips were used repeatedly (yeah, saw that, yep saw that already... etc) and instead of filming the countryside or town, the videographer focuses on one specific spot in a town (a tall castle, or one hill peak) so you don't get the see the rest of the town or hillside. Narration, when it exists at all, seems to be a complete after thought and is incomplete, boring, and tedious. This is not what I would call a quality product and given the price, it's a definite NOT RECOMMENDED review from me."
4,Your own private bird's eye view of your favorite spots in Scotland,"Like all the other videos in this series, you get a view from a helicoptor of all the major tourist sights in the specified country, in this case, Scotland. Most of us have not flown in a helicoptor over a country. So we all get a view that we cannot get from a walking or driving tour. It's well-done. I received it as a Christmas gift and was not disappointed. I've watched it several times and will watch it many more times in the future."
2,Very disappointing.....,"Too much of the video in this film focused on urban areas, no footage of the western Islands or the NW coast at all. Not even a shot of Cape Wrath. I also found the music to be a great annoyance. Why in the world use Bach's Brandenburg Concertos and other incongruous non-Celtic tracks when there is a treasure-trove of beautiful music from the Gaelic -speaking parts of British Islands to choose from, much of which must be in public domain by now? The narration was pleasant enough, but lacked any depth or real historical information. I wasn't expecting a major documentary here, but I was expecting a lot more than I got. Also, don't be fooled by the 88 min stated length. Twenty-nine minutes of this is outtakes with no narration, so I feel even more ripped off. Basically little more than insipid eye candy that is only of passing interest. I wish I'd have skipped it altogether."
2,Mediocre,"RoA is not a bad book. It's just not a good book. If your goal is to read every fantasy book set in a medieval period, this one won't give you a headache. But make sure you read it before you go on to Robin Hobb's Farseer saga or George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire. That's how I came to David Coe's book, and he suffers in the comparison. A great deal of the first quarter of the book is given over to exposition. And I could live with that. His land has some novel ideas. What's not so great is Coe waits forever to give us characters to hang our hat on. Until then, the reader is left standing around waiting for someone to invite them to the party."
5,Awesome fantasy,"This was a total impulse buy on my part based on the title and cover art. I can honestly say that I am very glad that I did buy it and am eagerly awaiting the release of the second book. This book is a wonderful blend of intrigue, sorcery, action, and everything else that is an element of good fantasy. I think that this book has not received the credit that it is due, I have recommended it to many of my close friends and not a single one has come back and told me that they did not like it.If you are looking for a good fantasy novel, with interesting characters, strong plot, and lots of excitement, Rules of Ascention is the way to go."
4,Underrated Fantasy Author,"David B. Coe has always been a comfort read for me. His books are always solid fantasy stories minus the usual formulaic storyline that is so prevalent in the genre. The first book in his Winds of the Forelands series is no different. Every once in a while I get in the mood to read fantasy, so when I do, it has to be something that is pure escapism with an intriguing plot. This book met both of those requirements and then some. I look forward to reading the second book and the rest of this series by one of the most underrated fantasy writers in the business today."
4,Bravo,This is a very unique book. The Qirsi have been defeated in battle. Some have assimilated into society and others have decided to fight for independence from those that do not have magic. They have carefully guided history to fit their agenda.I pray that the author does not end this series with a Qirsi / human marriage. I would be disappointed.
5,For hobby artists,"I bought this about 3 years ago and still turn to it for all my artwork. Once you get use to all the features it's very simple to use. I'm not a professional artists so I couldn't advice how well it is for that use but I draw, paint, and sketch in my free time and I'm never disappointed in the final result.I've added a link to one of my finished artworks that I used with this program.[...]"
3,pilgrims progess,"not the copy I was expecting to receive. Was looking for a blue cover, this had an ugly multi colored cover, and print inside is very very tiny."
2,Ooops. Read carefully.,I expected the same book as the soft cover edition in modern English.A good story but hard to understand in old English.
4,Helpful Resource for Primary Teachers,"I actually bought this book for my daughter who is a 1st grade teacher, so I have not used the book personally. As a retired teacher looking through the book, I was impressed with the number of ideas given to use as a springboard for writing activities. I liked the fact that children's literature was used and that the activities were very language-based, started at an easy level (for example, recognizing action words heard in a story) then progressed to students generating their own examples. My daughter tells me that she has found this book very helpful and has shared ideas from it with her teaching co-horts."
5,THIS GROUP IS AWESOME!,The Mangos are soo awesome and Mr. Knudsen is the coolest band teacher ever. He is my High School music teacher and he is the best!!! Buy his CD b/c it rocks!
5,THE MANGOS ROCK!,"Mr. Knudsen and his band, the Mangos, are awesome!When I first heard this CD I asked who the band was on the CD, and I was surprised that it was Mr. Knudsen's band. They are so awesome--buy the cd! Its worth it!"
2,not a book for veterans,"This book combined an exciting title with quite disappointing content to me. This is definitely not a book for those looking for solid analysis of the future of markeing and advertising, but just a laundry list of all exciting eye-catching gimmicks using wireless technologies. It looks like a cursory pachworks of materials from newspaper columns rather than a condensed book."
2,This book lacked cohesion.,"This book was a collection of four completely unrelated stories. The book came from four authors of three differnt genera, two romance authors, one mystery, and one science fiction. The four stories take place in completely different universes. I read this book because I have read all of Laurell K. Hamilton's books and liked them, however the novella in this book by her is nothing of the sort, it is simply the begining of her soon to be published book Narcisis in Chains. It has no conclusion whatsoever and in my opinion publishing portions of a book piecemeal lowers the value of the total book."
3,Laurell Hamilton is very smart,I got this book because of Maggie Shayne. I liked this book because of the excerpt by Laurell Hamilton. The anthology is not the sexiest nor the most interesting. All of the novellas except for Hamilton's and Shayne were difficult to get through. Skip this book and buy the Anita Blake series or the Twillight series by Maggie Shayne.
2,A little much.......,"to pay for the first 6 chapters of ""Narcissus in Chains"" by L. Hamilton.....not that I'm not going to buy it when it does come out, but the teaser for the book inferred that it was a new story, and NOT just the opening for a new book, which is why I wanted it, only to find out otherwise. The other storys were ok, having not read any of the authors before, and I might pick up another J.D. Robb story, but later....not immediately."
2,Beware of buying this book,"Unless you are dying to read a JD Robb short story, don't buy this book. It is a hodge podge of non related advertisements for these authors. Two stories are exerpts from upcoming books. I found this very frustrating and unsatisfying. Skip it."
3,JD Robb story worth it,"Being both a JD Robb and Laurel Hamilton fan, I purchased this book happily. The Robb story didn't fail to please, it was great. I was very disappointed in the Hamilton story, it was the opening scenes of her last book Narcissus in Chains! The other stories in the book were boring.If your a Robb fan, its worth it. If not, I'd pass."
2,J.D. Robb is great--The others aren't worth the time.,"If you are a fan of the J. D. Robb ""In Death"" series with Eve Dallas as the main character, then you will probably want to get this book just to read the short story featuring Eve Dallas by J.D. Robb. The other three stories will probably be an ever-increasing disappointment to you. The final story in this book was about a menage a trois and ended with absolutely no resolution of any of the plot points whatsoever. I rate it a complete waste of time and money. But I love Eve Dallas' character so I would have bought the book if only for her story."
2,Not worth the effort,"I BOUGHT THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT CONTAINED A ""NEW"" ANITA BLAKE STORY. IN FACT IT ONLY CONTAINS THE FIRST 6 CHAPTERS OF NARCISSUS IN CHAINS. THE ROBB STORY WAS GOOD, IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE EVE DALLAS SAGA, ELSE, YOU MIGHT NOT BE TO INTREAGED BY IT. I LIKED IMMORTAL AS WELL, BUT WAS GLAD IT WAS ONLY ABOUT 100 PAGES, I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE TAKEN ANY MORE. IF I HAD REALIZED THAT THERE WAS NO NEW HAMILTON STORY IN THIS ANTHOLOGY, I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT. AS IS IT, I'M MORE THAN A LITTLE SORRY I WASTED MY TIME AND MONEY. I SUGGEST YOU READ THE ANITA BLAKE SERIES BY HAMILTON, THE DALLAS SERIES BY ROBB, AND THE DARK JEWLES SERIES BY ANNE BISHOP. DON'T WASTE YOUR VALUABLE TIME ON THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU ARE A DIE HARD FAN OF ONE OF THE AUTHORS."
5,out of this world,out of this world is a amazing book and it holds you in until the end and it still is holding on in my head because it is a really great book and everyone who love weird love story should read this book because it will keep you on your toes the whole time and make you wish you were in the story yourself so if you beleive in love at all you will pick up this book and wont put it down until you are done with it so take it from me keep reading cause it will keep in your own little world for a little while until life gets in the way and i hope that you like what i wrote cause it is the truth so go out and get j.d. robb's out of this world book it really great story to read on a nice day or a raining day too enjoy i give this book a five star rating son it is really good
4,Susan Krinard's story great,"Susan Krinard's story is great. It is an original, fast-paced adventure & romance set in a futuristic universe setting she has used before, but with no overlap of characters: 5-stars. The two big-name authors write tired repeats of their typical storylines -- ho-hum stories: 2-stars. Maggie's story is okay but not memorable. I think Susan's story is worth the price of this book used."
2,What were you thinking?,"Had it not been for Nora Robert's contribution to this book, I would have rated it with no stars. The Eve Dallas story was great as usual, however the rest of the short stories were awful. I always read what I start but in this case I should have changed that rule. Just awful!!!"
5,great memories,"dick butkus, mel hein, bulldog turner, ray nitschke, max baughan, wayne walker, dave robinson, chuck howley, mike curtis and tommy nobis. clean 4 all ages!"
2,Boring,"This book sounded good, but it really was boring. The heroine was naive to the point of just being annoying. The hero just came off as extremely selfish and I saw no love here. Both the hero and heroine annoyed the hell out of me. This book had zero passion."
3,Lightning Reaction Extreme,"This product was awesome, but it broke after 1 week of use. When I opened the case to see what the problem was, I saw that there was tape on 2 wires and when I peeled off the tape, I noticed the wires were severed. So, kind of disappointing. But it was fun for the week it lasted!"
5,Fun to prank your friends,"Order came in fast and was playing with it as soon as the mail man dropped it off. All of my friends love it and want to play every weekend, (good drinking game). Laughs for hours with this toy."
1,Breaks too easy,I really really enjoyed this item until the second day I used it and one of the controllers went dead. It was not dropped or mistreated it was just junked.
4,I dont play this but my 15 year old loves it,"I didnt buy this for me. My son (age 15) and his brothers and friends love to play this. It works fine, but gives that feel that it could fall apart at any minute. But so far it hasn't and we have had it a few weeks. I figured for the price it was worth the risk and it has been so far."
5,HILARIOUS fun for adults,"After I saw this on Jimmy Fallon show, I had to try it out on my friends. It was HILARIOUS for those playing and for those watching! It might have been a bit less fun for those who lost and got shocked but if you are playing with good sports, this is one game that is fun and funny over and over again. Plus, it is instantaneous and doesn't take long to set up or play or start laughing."
5,HUGE FUN !!!!!!!!!!,"This is the most fun I've ever had with a bunch of guys. The shock is just powerful enough to make you NOT want to get it but it doesn't really hurt. Definitely not for old people or most girls, however it can be a great prank to play on people if you don't tell them it shocks you and you think of some fake thing it does. The best part is the time before everyone presses their buttons and the music is still playing...people start to freak out because of the suspense with nervous laughter and swearing. A must buy as long as you are not afraid of getting a mild shock."
3,"Passable stretch boots, but you have to put them on right","These are not leather, and they are not particularly durably made, but they are reasonably good for the price, especially if you can find them on sale. Regarding the review below -- you shouldn't try to zip these up. If you have largish calves, they won't zip. But that's fine; these are stretch boots and they aren't meant to be put on that way. To wear these, bunch them down around your ankle as if you're putting on long stockings. Then pull them up over your calves. This will work, unless your calves are too large for them anyway. (Size 7.5W stretches to about 16.5"" maximum.) Why is the zipper there? To remove the boots easily, of course.They probably will bunch a bit around the ankles, depending on your size."
5,There's no where to go but down!,"This book delivers on it's promise. The exercises are designed for people who aren't as limber as some others, taking special care not to stress out the knees and back. Each day has 2 exercises which you alternate for the 8 minutes and the eating plan is simple (no food is evil and you get to have a little chocolate every day!) to work with. I went to his website and signed up to keep track of weigh ins, etc., and for the great support of everyone else going through the system, but I stil use the exercises from the book. But does it work, you ask? In the week and a half since I bought this book and started doing it - I've lost 7 pounds! I feel like I finally have hope and I know this book is the answer to so many people's prayers."
5,I personally liked this book!!,I liked this book. It is true that some of the exercises were a bit simple but they gradually get harder. This book is for someone who hasn't exercised in awhile like me. Gradually you will need harder exercises and that is when you use the original 8 min. in the morning book. His book was a great motivator and I will definitely buy more of his books!!
5,A Great Road Map For Weight Loss Success,"I thought this book was great. It gives you a step by step plan to follow. It gives you daily helpful hints about diet/exercise that inform you of things you probably didn't already realize. This book is chuck full of inspirations, guild lines, and support. This book gives you the tools to help you to unlock the hidden reasons why you maybe emotionally eating. I should know, look on page 63, and you will find a before and midpoint picture of me. I highly recomment this book for anyone who needs guidance in starting thier weight loss journey.Good luck, you have come to the right place.Sincerely, Ann Kirkendall"
2,Watch out if you have other Jorge's books,"This book and Jorge's 8 ""Minutes in the Morning for Extra-Easy Weight Loss"" are almost word-for-word the same book! Not real impressive that an author would do this, not to mention a publisher (Harper Collins). I already had the ""8 Minute"" book and thought this would be a great addition. I was very dissapointed..."
1,This does not live up to any expecttions,"I read the reviews carefully and ordered the book. What a disappointment. I am returning it today even though I have to pay the shipping. This is a book full of hype about the author, his picture on page after page, words of how wonderful he is--get real, try Dr. Phil's Ultimate Diet - much much better and realistic. Don't buy this book unless you want to spend money on slick pages with Jorge's picture on most of them."
1,"about food, not exercise.","even if you are under a time constraint, if you have beem exercising for a while this book will do nothing for you. I must admit I haven't even tried the book exercises in the book even once, but I knew that doing the exercises in the book, would not make me feel as though I've exercised. If you don't have time to exercise, but you do exercise regularly, and want to get your heart rate up, get the 8 minute tae bo workout.For obese people, or someone who likes to stretch and take it really easy, this book is for you. But its more to do with eating, that actual exercising."
1,Exercises are too simple,"I have 25 pounds to lose so I bought this book. I'm insulted that Jorge used such ridiculously simple exercises. We are not invalids for cripe sake! A book has to be pretty bad for me to write a bad review. This is one of them.One of his ""exercises"" is standing there holding your arms out to the side. wow. how stupid is that? Hey Jorge did you ever think of exercise bands for beginners? duh. We can do that the only problem we have is the contorted postions sometimes expected by trainers, for example, Billy Blanks and his bootcamp dvd basic training warm up. Another stupid exercise by Jorge is lying on the floor and holding up a leg..wow.I returned the book and I won't be buying anymore by Jorge Cruise."
1,Lost promises,"This book DID NOT work for me. I had 10 pounds to lose and by the end of 30 days, I had not lost weight or inches. And no, I did not cheat on my eating. I personally didn't think that this is the book for someone who has always worked out and had 10 pounds or less to lose."
3,"Not bad, but not for me.","If you are completely desperate and need something really basic to follow, this is a good book. I'm overweight but these exercises were just too easy and I didn't feel challenged enough. I opted to start weight watchers and use some exercise videos instead. I did enjoy the book and it is very motivational if you want to start fresh."
5,Nice little book!,Simple but meaningful. I was surprised at how small it was but enjoyed reading and pondering the thoughts it provoked.
2,not worth the cost,"Simple enough truisms, just not worth the money. I would return it if the shipping back wasn't going to cost me almost as much as the purchase price. Pretty pictures, but I agree with some of the other reviewers, they should be bigger to be effective. I would want to pay about 2.99 for this book.Doesn't add anything that many other books have already stated more eloquently."
3,Expected more,"I expected more ""wisdom"". Was not what I expected. Came up short for me, very brief and not worth the price"
2,A little disappointed,"I received this book very timely, however it was a very quick read (in under 2 minutes). The book literally has about one to two lines per page. I felt that it was a waste of money and killing of a perfectly good tree to produce this book."
3,Elegant set design and costumes - unexciting dancing,"As usual for the Paris Opera Ballet, their production values are first rate--from the set designs and costumes to the lighting--but the principal dancers in this production are definitely second-rate. And they are not helped by a DVD director who offers us a continual shift in perspective--from ""you're on stage"" views to medium distance shots to 45 degree overheads, even top-down views of the Willis, turning them into twirling parasols. All this cross cutting prevents one from gaining an organic sense of the dance narrative."
3,delightfully frightful beastie,"Amiable characters, spooky script, and a delightfully frightful beastie. Based on a H.P. Lovecraft story."
5,A must read!,"""PowerSkills"" will change your life and change your business. Whether you're at the top of your company or determined to get there, you'll learn practical tips and techniques -- a sustainable process for becoming more savvy and successful in managing relationships for results."
3,not exactly perfect,"Not like my 30yr old original. the raw end of the crank screw should have a cover...the 1/2 inch raw edge is an accident waiting to happenMy old one had the raw end of the screw bent back into the wall of the sifter, thus leaving an almost smooth edge."
5,Quality teaching!,"With 22-segmented lessons, Pops, Locks & Shimmies kept me learning and engaged. Having the lessons insegmented chapters made it easy to jump around for areas that I needed to review. I found the team teachingapproach in this DVD very helpful. To clarify the technique of the movements, one teacher offered a verbalbreak down while the other modeled the movements. I learned so much and see growth in my technique.The excellent production quality and clear teaching methods, makes this one of my favorite instructional bellydance dvds."
5,OUTSTANDING!,"I just saw this band play in Hamburg, and they are even better live than on the album, busy but sinmple rock guitar...punk to the max!"
5,PRETTY IMPRESIVE!,"THE SONGS ON THIS RECORD ARE BRILLIANT! DON'T LET THE COVER FOOL YOU, THIS IS '77!"
5,Great delivery and wonderful content,William Owens writes a great story and history of hard times inour country.Ordering and delivery of the book was a pleasure.
3,"Informative, academic, possibly biased","China's Bitter Victory is an informative collection of academic essaysthat provide a wealth of detail on WWII China that's virtually unknownoutside of specialist circles. It tends to put the nationalist struggleagainst the Japanese in general and the KMT government in particular ina positive light, but readers interested in an antidote should read thechapter on China in Max Hasting's bookRetribution: The Battle for Japan, 1944-45 (Vintage). Definitely worth aread for those with a deep interest Chinese history,but is probably too dry for the average WWII buff."
2,Really difficult read,"The book is very difficult to read, with the prose not very interesting or engaging. Overly academic and not meant for non-historian. Had to skip many paragraphs and chapters."
2,Not simple for users,"This radio sounds good at first, but you will need to get an FCC license to operate this radio legally. Most people in the ""FRS"" market really don't need the extra power, cost and hassle of GMRS. So I'd label this radio ""don't try this at home"", unless you are a serious GMRS user."
3,Nothing new,No new songs on this cd.3 tracks:1)Life Is A Flower (Original Version)2)The Sign (Radio Edit)3)All That She Wants.I wish I had known this before I purchased.
2,ok for beginners,"I found this tape to be much too slow, not challenging at all. I did not finish the workout as I felt I was wasting my time. A true beginner could probably benefit."
1,Poor quality,"While it seemed okay during installation it later became aparent that it wouldn't aim high enough. Then in a couple of months it began to vibrate and move over time. Now its completely useless. Learn from my mistake, either buy a used one at the junkyard or buy an OEM from the dealer because this aftermarket mirror is junk."
4,PACKAGING,"THE BOOK WAS FINE AND DELIVERED PROMPTLY, BUT THE WRAPPING LEFT A STICKY RESIDUE THAT IS NOT EASILY REMOVED. I ORDERED TWO OTHER BOOKS FROM AMAZON AT THE SAME TIME AND THEY WERE PACKAGED GREAT."
4,Brenda,"Well done and informative. Loved the interviews with Gorbachev & Kissinger. THe behind the scenes look at the fall of communism and the Pope's role was interesting. Also was amazed at the relationship that the Pope had with the Reagan administration. Overall, I would say this was well worth my time and money."
1,Dissapointing documental,"This film, specially the third disc, is dissapointing. I thought it would be something based on true facts, but instead of saying the things as they were, the information is manipulated and combined with opinions of people that are out and against the Catholic Church and there are quite few opinions that come from people that are in favor of the principles and doctrine of the Catholic Church, I really think that this film was made to create confusion within the faithful catholics. Spend your money in something worthy."
1,pictures on web-site,when i ordered this product i was led to believe that it was more to it.i was very surprised when i recieved package only to find the total opposite of what i thought i had ordered.i am very displeased and will not order from there again.
3,The quirks outweigh the benefits- pass!,"After about a year and a half I have to come back and edit my review. They quirks never really got fixed and ultimately I stopped using it when they hit me up for another $30 to renew for another year.The biggest shortfalls to-date have been: 1) the system doesn't always recognize that the USB device is in there and I have to log off of that user and log back on; 2) we have had several times where for some reason it tries to log on to sites I've visited before and it can no longer do so; 3) it doesn't work with sites like ING which won't let software auto-fill their sign-in information; 4) after you enter in the IDVault password to log-on to a site, it often opens up another window and asks you again- all the while it is actually logging you on to the site.So it is a great concept but probably not worth the headaches. If I could reduce the number of stars I would."
1,Vista users beware,"This software was just the ticket to keep track of those ever annoying passwords I thought. Well long story short, it worked slowely on XP Pro. I would usually give up on waiting and just enter the password manually. Upgrading to a new computer with Vista it works with a couple accounts but won't work with most. Save your money!"
1,Save your time and money!,"Very frustrating. ID Vault did not work at all with one of the banks I use. It also interfered with downloading financial transactions into Quicken. ID Vault customer service was useless. When I reported that I could not download transactions while logged in using ID Vault, the customer service representative responded that "" ID VAult does not work with the Quicken browser."" When I explained that Quicken is not a browser, they responded that ID Vault does not work with Quicken. I tried it for several months hoping that I would get used to it. Unfortunately, the experience just got worse as I found more and more sites that were not compatible with ID Vault. All in all, this product wasted my time and money. So save yourself the aggravation and avoid this product!"
1,Worst software I have encountered,"I found this product to be the most unreliable and most unstable software I have ever encountered in 15 years of computer use. After 3 weeks of very sporadic operation, the software stopped functioning totally and now will not allow itself to be removed or reinstalled. As has been noted elsewhere in these reviews, a request for technical assistance was met with a generic and non-helpful computer generated response. While I was hopeful that this product would deal with the on-line security issues that we all have concerns about, my experience with this product proved to be very frustrating, time consuming and, ultimately, a waste of money."
1,XP Not Vista,Can't review product because it is not Vista ready. Purchased when I was getting a new computer. Disappointed that it hasn't kept up with the demand.
1,"It should be called ""ID JOKE""","I was excited at the possibility of a more secure system for sites I visit. At first I only had trouble with a couple, but got another 10 sites to work with it. Later, after trying again NONE of them would work. I spent hours putting in a lot of info to get a dismal result. A Real piece of junk. Of course even after erasing all the sites I had stored on it, I feel uneasy about returning it with my ""previous"" information lurking on it. Also requires a subscription after a year (fee unknown). Be warned."
1,Junk!!!! Don't waste your money or your time,This is junk. My laptop got slower every day until I finally uninstalled it today and cannot believe the difference. This product should not be on the market and the manufacturer should be embarrassed. Probably the worst piece of software I have ever installed on a pc in 20 years.
1,Shop Around,"This program is mediocre in comparison with Roboform Pro for the following reasons:1. You have to pay an annual subscription fee to keep it operational. Wouldn't be worth it if the initial software was FREE.2. Is not usuable on most public computers as you have to install software to make it run. Most public computers will not allow you to install software, so for those of us who travel to remote locations where we don't always want to lug a laptop, this program is USELESS.Do a little research, as I have, and you will see that this is not the product to buy. Another benefit to Roboform is that you can use the software for a free trial and if you have less than 10 passwords, there's no need to pay a cent. If you have more than 10 passwords (as I'm sure most of us do), it's a vastly superior product and way less expensive in the long run due to the renewals that you must pay for ID Vault."
4,Happy with IDVault,"I've had an IDVault for about six years, and though I sometimes have a problem getting in to my account when a website changes the log-on page, I've really been happy with my Vault because I appreciate the security it seems to provide for me while I'm online. I'm not very computer literate, but when I've encountered a problem, it has always been because of a change in the website. Most recently had a problem when a company merged with another company. IDVault is unable to sign me in because it isn't compatible with the new website. I don't consider this to be the fault of the Vault. I do agree, though, that IDVault customer service stinks."
1,Stay Away from this!,"This is a total waste of money. As already indicated it works on only about 50% of the websites. And even after adding a website you will continue receiving messages regarding ""do you want to add this site to I.D. Vault"". I was told to uninstall it and install it again. There was no improvement. And here is the kicker someone stole my identity while I was using I.D. Vault on the internet. But when contacted regarding the problem I was told it is not clear that it was a failure of the Vault. It might simply be one of the sites that was not able to interface properly. I think the developer might have purposely made it so it would not interface with 50% of the sites so this could always be used as a convenient excuse when it fails. Like I said a total waste. The only good thing is that is does is fill out your basic information such as your address and shipping address."
2,Disappointed,"Some websites can be successfully loaded into the device, others can't. ID Vault has been able to add ONLY 50% of the sites I regularly log onto and it has not been able to enter the website of a **leading** financial institution. Unless they come up with a new improved model,(will they ever?) I will never buy this thing again."
1,Merely a toy not worth the money,"I had high hopes when I saw this product. I bought one the first day I found it online. I only wish it had lived up to my expectations. It works fine with the less secure sites, but on sites where you really want high security, it's useless. Another problem is for no reason at all, it will just stop working. When this happens, you must manually login to your favorites.Of course, you can redo your favorites, but what a pain. Customer support is mostly non-existant, so you are pretty much on your own. One final thing, if you buy one be sure to use the ""backup"" feature. That way when it stops working you won't need to remember your passwords. Opps, I know I said one final thing, but you are probably wondering why I didn't return it. I had it all boxed up and the receipt in my wallet when it occurred to me that all my personal information was stored in the thing."
1,Not as advertised,"Being concerned about security, I bought the unit from a nearby Best Buy. I installed it in on my fully-updated Windows XP laptop. I found it difficult to use and that it would not work with my primary bank.My primary bank (Bank of America) has a two-screen login sequence, the first screen I enter my ID and on the second my password. The ID Vault only provides for a single screen login, and thus it is not useful.I returned it the next day. I eventually got my money back but the sales rep put up a fight as he claimed the device was a software device, even though it's worthless without the hardware piece. I had to bring in the store manager.Therefore...my advice to potential buyers...make sure you have a clean way to return this device before you buy it. If it works for you then you won't need it. But if you run into problems, you'll be glad you did."
5,Very Well Made and Roomy,"Excellently made, and, it allows good room and a nice fit for my Horton Crossbow, Quiver, and added options/accessories. I like it and thought good deal for the money."
1,Don't waste your money,This is quite possibly the worst book on holistic health I have ever read (and I have read quite a few). I am a strong believer in natural healing but this book is the stuff of charlatans and snake-oil salesman. Don't waste your money. I wish I didn't.
5,"Have used it, with great success, for 2 years!","I have arthritis in my hip joint and have tried all the glucosamine, chondroitin and other joint helpers on the market. I had just ok results with them and decided to go online for some help. I searched through the many products online & found Flexcin about 2 years ago. I was, and still am, amazed at the results of this product. I am here to tell anyone that cares that this product works great! No more sharp pain from my rubbing hip joint! AMAZING!"
1,Flexcin does not work.,"Tried flexcin for 12 days. I did a double dose as recommended on the label. Absolutely no help. E-mailed Flexcin with questions and got no response. As far as I'm concerned, this is a scam"
3,Flexcin w/cm8 caps,"My left knee has mobility problem caused by arthritis. I thought that the caps might help, but having used up all 90 caps I feel no difference. In other words, the caps did me no good. Since they did not help and did not appear to hurt I gave three stars."
5,Knee pain gone!!!,"What a great product. Started taking Flexcin about a month ago and within a couple weeks, my knee pain was virtually gone! I can play my favorite game of golf without any pain. Thanks Anita for suggesting it and thanks Flexcin for an amazing result."
5,YES!!!! It WORKS!!!,"My husband (58) has very bad arthritis in his hands - we live in a cabin and use logs for our winter heat - after he spends a day chopping the logs the pain in his hands are unbearable, he couldn't work again for 2 days - I put him on Flexcin CM8 a month ago - he is now able to chop the wood and not have any pain in his hands!!! He is now a strong believer and sharing the news with everyone he comes in contact with!!!"
1,Flexcin did NOTHING!,"I have suffered from chronic pain for years. My final diagnosis or more accurately ""failure to diagnose"" that I have been given is ""fibromyalgia"". Doctors have tried several different medications with little or no results and many times bad side effects. Desperate I tried Flexcin maximum dose for 90 days. It did NOTHING! If you have joint trouble, this stuff may work but for nerve and muscle problems it does nothing."
3,Ho-hum!,"I have bursitis in my heel and it is painful to walk. I have been using Flexcin for about three weeks and haven't noticed any difference. I will finish the bottle using it per the instructions, but I am getting less hopeful each week about it's effectiveness. If it works for you, fantastic."
1,order incomplete,I ordered Peanut Butter & Honey as well as Protein bars but half the order was Peanut Butter Crunch which I did not order and I did not like.
1,Not really anti-fog!,Purchased these goggles as a gift for someone who wanted something that wouldn't fog up when walking outdoors in the winter months. It has been reported back to me that they fog up! Certainly defeats the whole purpose of the purchase and certainly wouldn't recommend these.
2,"Interesting Topic, but poorly delivered","The topic of the super-wealthy in any country is interesting to many, but this one is so unique and so very ""Japanese"". I liked the topic, but I felt like it was more like a bland documentary on TV. I wish there was a little more contextual excitement presented. It reads a bit like a chronology in a history book.If you like reading about Japan, it's worth checking-out.iKnow"
3,Snow Board Pack,Nice Pack & good quality but ........I bought this Dakine 11-Litre Heli Pack as birthday gift for someone. I thought it was a Pack for Longboards but it's for snowboards so I had to return it .
5,Dakine Heli-Pack,"This back pack is awesome... I was borrowing my friend for about 2 months now using it for hiking and jogging. I'm a bigger guy 6'-3"" 220lbs and when adjusted properly it fits me just fine; My smaller friends have also used it and the adjust-ability works out perfect now they all are going to buy Heli-Packs now :) Also- we all snowboard & ski living in the PNW, so i will have to wait and see how that works out, I will probably end up buying the camelback style bladder for this bag as well. There is a small pocket on the left shoulder strap that is perfect for mp3 players. Makes for a great gym bag too. Quality is excellent for the price, Just buy it already you wont regret it.Dakine 11-Litre Heli Pack"
3,did not work,did not see good results i was hoping i would see some good results but unfortunately did not is there something else that works?
3,EXCUSE ME!,"I get so mad every time I read this book. I liked it, but it makes me mad. I live in Montana, in the heart of ranching country, and I am tired of people picking on it. We do not ride old, ugly horses. I know many, many horses, and they are gorgeous. I own a mustang mare and she is beautiful. Also, we do not wear purple-fringed clothes and ride around in old beat up trucks with I'D RATHER BE RIDING bumper stickers. I show in 4-H and rodeos and have seen many rodeo queens, and when people dress for show they wear nice clothes, not purple-fringes. Also, we are not all weird about ""being one with your horse."" I personally do not know anyone who would braid their hair into their horses mane. I would like to rate this book 5 stars, but beacuse of all the Montana junk, it only gets three stars.... I LOVE Montana!"
3,# 41,"tis was an ok book. i liked the parts about parker and foxy,but a horse and rider can't come out of nowhere and win some of the biggest events like lyssa and soldier blue. i like the more realist books and books about christina."
3,okay,"I think Parker acted way too young. He's trying for the Olympics, right? That takes a lot more focus and dedication than he showed in this book. He wouldn't be so hassled by the girl and Chistina acted silly, too. I ddi think it was okay to throw in some eventing. The endless races get to be way too much. If you want to read a really good book, get Shadow Horse by Alison Hart. Read it this summer--you won't be disapointed!"
4,CLOSE CALL BUT TOO MUCH JEALOUSY,CLOSE CALL WAS REALLY GOOD EXCEPT PARKER WAS WAY TOO JEALOUS. PARKER NEEDS TO REALIZE THAT THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOMEONE BETTER THAN YOU. IT WAS GOOD ALL IN ALL. THE ONLY THING I WOULD CHANGE IS PARKER NOT SO JEALOUS.
2,O.K but not the best,This book was um interesting.....SO WHAT IF SHE CAN RIDE W/O abit big deal! people ride bare/no bridle all the time! and WHY wouldthis upset Parker? I thought HE would be the type that would probly ride w/o tack if he had the chance! so this book was pretty dumb.......BUT it does mention Katie and Dylan! Did anyone notice that by what the book says that KAtie and Dylan might be going out? WEIRD!
4,Glad to have it,"As mentioned this device was not essential. However, as it eliminated identifying and tapping 6 major wires I enjoyed having it. Finding and tapping the parking light and lock/trunk wires was a big enough job. This harness is a bit difficult to install as both it, and the factory harness are fairly rigid due to the heavier gauge wiring on some of the lines. However it makes the installation clean and straight forward. For only $20 delivered I would highly recommend its use."
2,T-Harness is over-rated,"There are limited connections made with the harness, you have many others to do in addition. On top of that, the harness is large so in a car with limited room behind the dash you have problems getting it all stuffed back in there."
3,"Not quite what I expected, but still worked","I am only giving this item 3 stars because the description is somewhat misleading. It does save some time during the installation of a remote starter, but it does not cut installation time in half. This item is also made outside of the U.S. unlike most other Bulldog products made in the U.S.A. The item ends up being very bulky with an extra amount of wiring to hide under the dash. I might consider using an item like this again, but it would strictly depend on the vehicle. I wouldn't recommend it just because its available."
1,if you want to save time get t harness,if you want to save time always use a t harness made the job so much easyer
4,Interesting tedium,"Took a little time to get going but once it did I read the book in two days. Extremely well researched and insightful. Have always been a Hitch fan, but was never aware of what a disturbed and internalized individual he was. The depth of this portrayal of the subject is surprising. Typically, a story like this will delve into relationships in the subject's life but Hitchcock really didn't have any. The author does a nice job of explaining the probable reasons for this. I recommend this book to fans of Hitchcock the man because it goes a long way in explaining why he made the films he did. Not to be confused with a technical ""anthology"", it's more like a psychological analysis into the twists and turns of the inside of Hitchcock's head. He was a strange dude!"
5,Hitchcock: What Price Hollywood?,"The best bio of Hitch you're likely to ever read. Gremlins, for theirown pervo reasons, slam this as ""gossip."" Spoto details, with care, thetextured & complex life of a great filmmaker who was a mama's boy andJesuit trained. He had lower-class roots but quickly learned the differencebet well-dun and rare, along w the better spirits. In the German UFA studiosof the '20s Hitch developed his consummate technical skills and discoveredthe importance of telling a film story visually. He entertained us forover five decades.Spoto generously does not dwell on the most odious segment of Hitch's careerwhen, after 6 successful collaborations w composer Bernard Herrmann, he suddenlybooted Bernie fr the score of his clinker, Torn Curtain. Allegedly, studio goofs felta 'mod' sound would bring life to the corpse. Then, in turnabout, Hitch used a fauxBernie score. What price Hollywood?"
1,"Awful, boring, fragmented, and utterly lousy","The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock is a horribly written biography about the man himself. It is so wildly disjointed, incredibly fragmented, and surrounded by opinions, conjectures, and theories that don't collaborate well with facts. I am totally unable to follow the book because the author likes to jump around in the years of Alfred Hitchcock's life while feeding personal opinions about this or that. At the same time, there are more holes in the presentation of his background than a pound of Swiss cheese. What an awful book!"
3,"recommend, with small reservation","Book arrived on time and as expected, but reeking of cigarette smoke. I suppose that is a risk when buying out of print titles, from back in the day when everyone smoked."
1,"Is Spoto posting reviews of his own books, or what?","A few minutes of research of some facts proves that Mr. Spoto is anything but a fiction writer. Many biographers are known for twisting, stretching, and misinterpreting facts and Spoto is one of those writers.[...]"
2,Not as sturdy as it looks...,"I am a man who loves his tea. I drink up to a dozen cups a day, so I use my tea ball quite frequently. My major complaint with most tea balls, and the reason I must always replace them is that eventually the clip begins to not fasten securely. Over time this gets worse, and the tea ball becomes unusable. There are other balls with clips that are a bit more sturdy.I just got this tea ball in the mail a week ago, and while it is still usable, the clip is already losing its grip. Look somewhere else for a tea ball."
3,Gets the job done,"This product does what it should... holds the loose tea in place while it steeps. I think the quality could be a little better. Sometimes the clasp feels like it could easily fall off if you aren't careful. However, it is a fine product for its purpose."
3,It's ok,"Does not stay together, must use something to secure the edge to hold the contents in the ball. I use a small alligator clip."
2,Missing piece when delivered,The tea ball was missing the chain when it was delivered to me. Without that there was no use so I needed to return it. Was easy enough to buy one elsewhere after that rather than waiting for a replacement. May have been a one-time issue though.
2,Good Design - Poor quality,"Bought 2 recently - the bottom 'clip' in one of the carts broke within the first 4 days out on the course.However, given the $28 investment, if you get to use it more than 7-8 times, you have break-even.Do not buy it expecting great quality / long life."
4,Detailed and useful,"While other reviewers may have been displeased with this book, I found it highly useful and relevant. I am a senior undergraduate marketing student, so that may color my perception of the text differently.I will agree that the case studies lack insightful analysis. However, there is great consideration given to differing strategies and methods of analysis- the authors are not quick to declare one better than the other.The subject hierarchy within each chapter could use better organization. For example, there are five steps in identifying which market to serve, yet those sections are at the same ""level"" as Identifying Markets. I kept having to turn back to verify I was still in a subcategory of a subject.This is one of the few textbooks from my entire undergrad experience that I plan on keeping rather than reselling. Instead of giving vague theories, this text defines concrete methods and step-by-step processes for carrying out and implementing strategies."
1,"Very impractical, twisted and equivocal","This is the first book review I've written in my life. I'm a graduate student currently pursuing a MSc in Mkt. I currently stand at the 99th percentile of my degree.This is by far the most impractical book I've ever read. There are a few useful concepts but nothing that hasn't been said in a marketing strategy book. Some explanations are far too ambiguous and general. Thus, it's very easy to lose track of what you are reading. Remember those long boring passages on the GMAT/GRE? Well, this book is full of them. While there aren't many books directly related to strategic marketing, this one certainly does not help nor does it create interest in the subject. Ask your professor to drop the book and substitute it with scholarly articles."
1,"Looks great, but that's about it","I bought a 688B in November, and have used it twice on trips of 700 miles or so. It blows open at highway speeds - the front edge actually opens 1-2 inches, allowing rain, snow, and ice to blow in. The mounting cleats also came apart after the first use. What was easy to install now takes two people and a lot of delicate alignment to match the parts up. Not at all what I would expect for what this box cost. I do not recommend it."
3,Warning - The Atlantis 2100 Will Not Fit on a 2003 Honda Pilot,"I have a 2003 Honda Pilot with a factory roof rack. The Thule website (as of early June 2008) clearly states that an Atlantis 2100 fits on a 2003 Honda Pilot. The web site is wrong (as Thule's customer service rep admitted to me on the phone). The Atlantis 2100 is about 8 inches too long and hangs over the back preventing the rear hatch from opening completely. Thule - please correct your web site!Other than the web site inaccuracy, I think that the Atlantis line of products is quite good."
1,Focuses to much on getting rich and twists God's proverbs,This Book fails to realize that religion should not be used to make money for personal wealth it should be used instead to help others. I was very disapointed. This book downplayed charities and looked down on the average worker. It tended to support rich people or those with many workers under them. It was not original at all most of the work was just taken from proverbs from the bible and twisted into the theme of making a quick buck. Please don't buy this book donate to charity instead. I'd like to know why Steve Marr is trying to make a profit off of religion.
2,Didn't work for me,"The concept is great, but when I connected the large connectors into the 98 Dodge Dakota vehicle's harness there wasn't enough room to put the covers on the bottom of the steering wheel. I did however, use some of the wires and the smaller connectors. I'm not sure if I was doing something wrong, but I didn't see anyway for those connectors to all fit."
1,blue petal mist mister,"product was okay, easily knocked over, this product has past it's time. Other items have taken it's place now. Truly, the first time my dog ran past it caplouey! on the floor it went pretty, but not practical"
2,Original Guitar Players Are Better,This CD is similar to alot of other CDs in the market. I give it two stars for nothing is accomplished here.
4,More of the same wonderful consistency,"I quite like this fellow. I use much of his works as background to my Photo production for home CD's. A nice feel to it, and good quality to the entire album"
5,Beautiful and artistic,"this is beautiful music, well worth the price, I bought it used and it played like new. I would recommend this music to anyone who loves good guitar music. Great for background music or even to listen to before sleeping. to relax with."
3,A Bit too Distant For a Romance,"Because romance novels are based on emotion, a distant style can be a difficult problem for an author to overcome. And while BEWITCHING THE BARON features a fairly exciting story line, the lead characters never came to life for me. Then too, one of the book's strengths early on - the essence of the English countryside in the 1730's, with its attendant superstition and fear of witches - became melodramatic as the book moved into its final quarter. Even so, when the story moved out of the countryside and into London, whatever connection I had managed to make with the hero and heroine disappeared.Author Lisa Cach shows a tremendous amount of promise, and I really wanted to like this book better than I did. But because I never truly connected with either lead character, I never felt the joy of their coming together, finally, in love for a happily ever after.TTFN, Laurie Likes BooksPublisher, All About Romance"
5,Good Value !,They are very comfortable and stylish! It's a good bye and I recommend them. Might not be ideal shoe for people who sweat a lot.
5,Kids loved it,"I wasn't sure if this coloring book would be appealing to children, but I gave it a shot--and my 5-year-old visitors spent an entire afternoon being amused by it. A good buy!"
5,Vanilla Citrus Hand Soap,"We have used this product for years. I keep it in all of our bathrooms and get rave reviews from family and guests alike. It feels great, produces nice suds, smells wonderful and leaves your hands feeling clean and moisturized. It has been so popular I now buy it to give for gifts."
1,Simply dangerous,"I have one very similar to this, same design, material, just a different brand. It's dangerous to use it to crack crab shells as it is nearly impossible to keep a firm grip on the smooth surface. Also the jaws aren't designed to really clamp around anything and the teeth are rounded and useless. Since the handles are also so short, it is not possible to really gain any leverage."
3,The Young Messiah-Messiah XXl on CD,"This was a different type of musical experience, for me. I did enjoy the combination of voices from the different genres. One of the entertainers, featured in this CD, is a family member and it was enjoyable to hear him outside of his usual element."
1,COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY,This has to be one of the worst cd's i have ever bought. I was barely able to listen to the whole thing 1 time it was so horrible. I would not recomend it to anyone. There was not even 1 good track. Don't waste your money.
1,ripoff,"this cd is a joke. it is a total ripoff of a louie devito cd. when i first heard it on the radio, i thought it was his cd. i bought it anyway. this guy wants to be like louie so bad it's not even funny. i went down the shore to see him dj. all he did was play pre mixed cd's. i hope they didn't pay him to spin."
4,Everybody want's to be like Devito !,"Im a big music fan love club music I have :Ultra dance vol. 5 (vic Latino and David waxman)Hit factory (Johnny budz)Dance mix NYC vol' 1 - 5 (Riddle)NYC afterhours (bad boy Joe)Dance like (happy boys)and they all sound like Louie devito cds, but you can confuse Louie mixing skills they are unique, so keep on trying, you all have a long way to go ,Going back to nyc afterhours,the mixing is good just like Louie's cds i have to say, its maybe one of the best out in stores todaybut LOUIE DEVITO IS STILL THE BEST"
5,A great little vibrator,"This combo is a hot and sexy sex toy. What it is is a simple bullet vibrator with a simple one-touch on-and-off switch. But don't sell it short, it is a quiet and yet powerful vibrator. Also it is waterproof for easy cleaning. As an added bonus, this bullet comes with a jelly sleeve that goes over the bullet, giving a wider range of sensations when the little knobs on the sleeve are passed over the skin.This is a great little vibrator, with a non-intimidating appearance, which makes it a good candidate for a first vibe. I highly recommend it.Don't forget, a bullet is really intended for external use. It is too small to insert and yet keep a grip on it. If you really MUST insert it, make sure you first place it in a condom, and then keep hold of that.(Review of Waterproof MINI Wireless One Touch y2 Massager with Soft Sleeve and Batteries)"
1,massage,I didnt like this one because it didnt last long at all. I could barely feel the vibrator. I will not definetly buy this again!
5,Poirot-Vol 2,We love all of these types of mystery theatre British mysteries. They do it best. We've enjoyed this and the other series we've bought and like that we have them on hand for watching whenever we want (especially as years go by and things get harder to find.)
3,Good but disappointing,"I had expected to see all for lead characters (Poirot, Hastings, Japp and Miss Lemon) in all of these mysteries. In fact they are all only present in two of the mysteries. Most of the others have only Japp or Hastings with one or two having both of them. Poirot is always good, but it's the four-actor ensemble that makes the mysteries great. By all means buy this collection. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Just don't expect a complete compliment of lead characters in most of the stories."
3,Beautifully done but needs one thing,"The production is great, it looks as though it cost a fortune. The acting is very good. The problem is the English accents and the low talking. Poirot begs for captioning."
3,"Classic Agatha Christie, but poor video quality","This contains the first original granada television episodes. And it shows...Extremely poor transfer quality makes this look almost as bad as a bootleg DVD. It looks like it was projected on a old screen and then video taped. The blacks are striped and really noisy and the whites are blown completely out. This is a shame because the original UK broadcast copies were in pristine condition.It would be great if Acorn Media would reissue a better quality DVD, since the set design and costumes really deserve better."
5,"Great Performance, Transfer Quality?","I just got this, and I must agree that the quality of the transfer is debatable. That it was shot on 16mm film explains part of it, but it is also quite full of squiggly digital artifacts. Acceptable, but little more. I also agree that the plastic case is dubiously made. The center holder is too tight, making removing the discs without cracking the center hole a real risk. So be very careful, and press hard on the center button, which helped me to loosen the discs. Of course, all this fades once you start watching, because this is a great set of performances by Suchet and the cast."
3,Agatha Christie's Poirot The Classic Collection Vol 2,This product was totally marred by the fact that one of the dvds would not play due to wrong regional code. Further marred by fact that attempts to get a response from Amazon lead to being spammed by Spanish language site after emailing a request for help to Amazon.com
5,Best children's nursery rhyme and fairy tale book ever made.,"This is the best child's book ever made. Comes with almost all fairy tales as originally written (before disney), lots of nursery rhymes, poems, and a variety of other quality stuff."
5,We are very happy with this BUNN brewer!,"We were somewhat apprehensive that we would find another BUNN that was as good as our classic one we had and used every day for about 17 years, but this one is an excellent replacement!!!I love that it does not begin to fill the caraffe until the lid is swiveled closed and the stainless steel is really nice. We love it!"
5,"fast, excellent product!","My wife and I for years have relied on a low line coffee maker that usually did not produce the hot coffee we would want. Well we decided to look on amazon for an avordable high end model and we found it! This Bunn coffee maker is simple, and produces incredible coffee and does so extremely fast! I highly recomend!!"
2,Leaking coffee pot,"When I received this item from Amazon it leaked about a cup of water per pot. The company sent me a new one, but it cost me another $20 to send the pot to them which they did not reiimburse."
4,Hot High Altitude Coffee,We have a cabin at about 9000 ft and the coffee maker didn't produce hot coffee. I researched a little bit and bought this one. It solved the temperature problem and it makes a pot of coffee in less than 5 minutes. The only drawback to this machine is that it takes a lot more coffee per cup of water to produce an acceptable strength brew than other machines I have used. For a 10 cup caraffe it takes about 1 1/4 cup of dark roast coffee.
5,Great Coffee Maker,"we got two of these for the office, one for decaf and one for regular. they work great. coffee is easy to make."
5,Excellent hot coffee,"I live about a mile high and this coffee maker is wonderful. We wanted very hot coffee and this does it. Great coffee and very quickly. If we go out of town, we just turn it off and back on the night before we need it. Easy to clean. We are very pleased with it. Our first Bunn home brewer."
3,Had to return this one,"I had to return this coffee maker.I liked the design and function but the water wasn't hot enough.I had to use twice as much coffee to get a good cup of coffee.I started checking the temp of the water and the water at the spray head was 140.I contacted Bunn, and the support person told me the engineer said the temp should be 175 to 185 at the spray head.So ..... I returned this one as a defective item, and am not replacing it.I bought a Tecnivorm KBG-741"
5,Great reference book!!,"I ordered and studied this book because it was listed as a source in books I had learned so much from. The book doesn't read to ""dry"", and when it doesn't have the info, it says so and why, like in the Celtic section. If you are interested in the Old Ones, buy this book!"
3,3 1/2 Stars,"Another of Raymond Fowler's books in the field of UFOlogy, this time down the path of a case that resembles very much the modern abductee phenomenon - but that this occurred in the Seventies. It is an interesting case in that there is an attendant multiple witness UFO sighting, but from there it gets weird and takes on all the hallmarks of the modern abductee experience and all that this entails. The first half of the book read easily for me, but once it went beyond some of the initial experience of the sighting and abduction it bogged down as we go on an hypnotic journey to other worlds. It is - for me anyway - an interesting hybrid case. A reasonably solid UFO sighting, but mixed with a fantastical abduction experience. I don't quite know what to make of it really. But it should be read as part of the larger body of works on the subject."
4,great quality!,"I purchased this for a Christmas gift and was very impressed with the quality of the sword. it has a nice weight, good detail and is sure to please any Kill Bill fan or Katana collector. The stand is merely okay, hence the 4 rather than 5 star rating. But the sword far surpassed my expectations for the price."
3,It's ok.,"It is okay, but it is cheaply made. it is a good toy. It is not sharp at all and the sheath is plastic."
3,"For the price, okay","The review that said this sword was dull is absolutely right, extremely dull. I'm buying this sword as a prop though, so I can say that it looks passable. Doesn't seem exceptionally sturdy.One thing I was surprised by was that on one side of the blade (opposite the logo) it has 'China Stainless Steel' printed into the metal. The scabbard leaves behind some waxy particles every time you remove the sword from it.Overall though, I'm happy what I got for what I paid for. A solid replica."
2,You get what you pay for,"This sword is as dull as a butter knife. I tried to cut through the cardboard box it came it and it barely cut that. It only cut in a few inches then tore the rest of the cardboard. I'll admit I don't have any training with a sword but how good do you have to be to cut cardboard. It's not even the good strong cardboard that posters come in; it's just regular cardboard. I looked at the blade's edge and it's hardly even been sharpened. And it's off center, too. The tip of the blade is still pointy and sharp, though.Also, this sword can be had for $19.99 from other retailers here at Amazon. And there's even a two-sword set for $26.99."
3,Sigmund Snopek III - 'First Band On The Moon' (Musea),"'First Band...' as it turns out,is actually a reissue of Snopek's obscure 1977 lp.Can you beat that?I've heard OF his name before,but I was never aware of who he was.The Milwaukee native has apparently been in the business for thirty-plus years now.He's been noted for being a friend and touring member of the Violent Femmes in the '90's.Snopek is mainly a keyboardist,but he's also known to be a versatile musician as well as performer.There's no way I can even classify his music on 'First Band...' other than I will say it gets better with each play.A couple of the most inspiring tracks are ""Dr.Alles"",""Highway Ghosts"" and the melodic ""Let's Take A Trip"".Line-up:Snopek-keyboards,flute&vocals,B.Wiemann III-guitar&vocals,Jim Gordon-bass and Mike Lucas-drums.A unique experience to be had here,that's for sure."
4,'S No Peck like Snopek!,"Who'd'a thunk one would dare use the phrases ""art rock"" and ""Wisconsin"" in the same sentence? But this Wisconsin art rock classic (originally released under the group name ""Snopek"") is grand, mixing classical styling, great dry wit, and a good bit of danceability. I have been a fan of this album since its initial release, and highly recommend it to anyone curious about how cool (spritually, not merely physically) Midwesterners can be!One complaint regarding this release, though. Initial vinyl releases came with a bonus single. Its b-side, ""Solalex,"" is here, but it sickly humorours, Zappa-esque a-side, ""If You Love Me, Kill Yourself"" is sadly absent. Let's restore that!"
5,Where else but Amazon,"I took some bulbs out of some night lights to use in lamps. Could not find any mogul bases anywhere but here. It works fine. However just last night, I was looking a some grow lights and found what I really wanted, which was this big mogul base with a heavy duty lamp cord already attached. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FL3MBK/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00 That's the link for mogul with wire."
5,A Brilliant Documentary,"I'm a lifelong baseball fan, with a special interest in the Negro Leagues. I consider this the finest baseball documentary I've ever seen. The film exemplifies both technical expertise and great sensitivity to the subject matter. The interview sequence of the Pittsburgh Crawfords legendary outfield of Cool Papa Bell, Jimmie Crutchfield, and Ted Page stands as some of the best baseball footage ever. The director, Craig Davidson, has portrayed life in the shadows of black baseball with great brilliance and I give ""There Was Always Sun Shining Someplace"" my very highest recommendation."
2,pass this one up,"Well I was excited when i first read about this book and ordered it. Well now that I've read it I wish I had spent my money on something else. This book left me cold from chapter one. The heroine in this book, Golde, is a foul mouthed, crude, hateful mystic who has been telling fortunes even though she cannot see the future. She agrees to help the Baron of Skyenvic, Gavarnie, the hero who is blind for a price. There is an evil plot and it seems to take forever to find out who is behind all of it. There are some mildly funny parts to this book but they are few and far between. I was really disappointed in this book."
1,Not very funny. Overrated!,I bought this because it was so highly reviewed at Amazon.com but it proved to be a barely passable medieval romance. The lousy heroine out-and-out said that she really HATED kids! The hero always assumed the worst about Golde and immediately proceeded to almost kill her--which really ain't loverlike. What little descriptions of the era could use some improvement by some examples of Roberta Gellis' work.
2,not too bad...or good,"OK, I'd been waiting for this CD for ages, and from what I'd heard of Scarling, it was going to be great. I was disappointed. The three songs in the middle all sound pretty much the same, although standout tracks are Band-Aid and Black Horse Riding Star. It's a nice CD to sit and listen to but has nothing like the energy or passion that went into Jack Off Jill. Boring."
2,A Dissapointment,"The CD was a huge dissapointment for me. The first song, is probably the best.THE LAST DAY I WAS HAPPY!!Awesome drumming and guitars, put together very well. A good opening to the CDBAND AID COVERS THE BULLET HOLEA lighter song, but very enjoyable and catchyCRIPSIN GLOVERA little boring, but it's an OK songALEXANDER THE BURN VICTIMWhat the hell???BABY DRACULAExcellent, song, always a good listenBLACK HORSE RIDING STARA little long, and a little boring. It didn't have a good melodyCAN'T... omg... what a boring song.I would NOT reccomend this CD seeing as there are only 3 out of 7 really good songs.This is a major upset, and I think Jessika is losing her touch. Jack Off Jill was much better... =/"
1,Inconsistent Heresy,"Complete lunacy, this man is an impostor. He claims that for the first time in history he had finally figured it out, while no one else could. He thinks demons are little round objects that sit on the ground until you step on them, and then they enter you. Ask him yourself :) This is a joke, that is why there is only 2 reviews. I hope others will come along who paid this man money for his fraudulent seminars and write some more. JESUS IS TRUTH, Wallen's blabber is lies and madness."
1,Defective Product,"One of the fastening knobs that hold the bikes to the rack broke as i was simply tightening it, which did not take much pressure to break it.. also the rope snapped while going over small bumps. It was a hassle to put on and take off. Additionally, the bikes were not very secure while i was driving.. I was very disappointed with my purchase, this product was clearly defective. Now i will have to hassle with a refund and buy another one :("
4,First rate interpretation but bad recording,"This was recorded around 1977, but it sounds like a recording from the sixties. There is a lack of presence of the choir as if it was recorded through thick felt.Maybe the tapes were old. Apart from that the interpretations are first rate and some of the tempi were a surprise to me, having sung some of these works, but in the end I agreed with Corboz's masterful interpretation.This is very fine music, quite easy to listen to, which every amateur of choral music should know."
2,Poor repro ads and little original info spoil it...,"When I received this book, I was hoping for a history of the Beetle Convertible. What I got was a bunch of badly reproduced original adverts and their DIRECT translations into English (with titles like ""Drive the VW Karmann Ghia - With Reason"" ? ) as opposed to a re-wording in context.Some of the pictures were quite good, but most looked like they'd been scanned straight out of another book. If they had originally been double-page photo's, then there would be a large chunk missing down the middle of the repro pic, where the original's page spine had been. Fine for someone's website maybe, but not for a hardback publication.Aside from the first few pages, there was little original information. The remainder of the book was given up to a few odd paragraphs (and of course, the above mentioned 'translations' of adverts).Overall I felt letdown and if nothing, a bit cheated by this book."
5,Inspiring Embrodiery,"I have coveted this book for some time and have now got a copy of it!I must admit that I am absolutely awe-inspired by it - and it has re-awakened an impulse to go beyond my skills. It also inspires envy in me for those lucky enough to be apprenticed at the School.The book is beautifully laid out and the project/exercises are easy to follow.With the projects, the tips and the detail included, this book is a must for all embroiderers."
2,Defective,"I have used this product model many times in the past with satisfactory results. However, the particular gun I received and subsequently used did not work correctly. The powder loads only advanced about 20% of the time, the re-cock action was not as easy as it should be even with added lubricant.I had no choice but to continue use of the gun but remain unhappy with this particular gun's performance.It seems to be a factory defect.Thank you"
1,A One-sided Report,"To quote the late sacred elder of Western research and writing, C. Leland Sonnichsen, ""I don't see why this book had to be written!"" The reason is that the writer had pre-selected his conclusion and considered only information that tended to prove his prejudice. This is so obvious as to turn off an unbiased reader.Save your money. This book is unsliced baloney."
5,God Is in the Hard Stuff,"I purchased the wonderful book for my 2 children, ages 21 and 23. They are making their own lives and this book is full of inspiration and support when life gets tough."
2,A little disappointed,"I found this book to be good as far as truth - but I have not found it to be uplifting as I thought it would be. For me, I know what the Word says - and I know we may go thru troubles, but I was looking for a book to give a little more hope...."
3,Book of Encouragement,I purchased this book to give to a friend who was going through a difficult time in her life. I had seen it in a store and thought it looked helpful.
5,Excellent,I was purchasing Sencha Green Tea from another distributor I found on Amazon. They informed me it was unavailable after buying it for 2 years. I had to find someone else. I searched through Amazon and came across this tea. It is superior in quality and taste. Arriving in a reasonable amount of time. I hope they don't tell me it is unavailable any time soon.
1,"If you are not Mormon, don't bother",Hugh Nibley is (or was) the Church Historian of the Mormon Church. If you are Mormon you will find it faith promoting. If you are not you will find it utter nonsense.
3,Performance: 5; Production: 1,"This is the first DVD of a very entertaining, tuneful, unjustly neglected opera, but if Berlioz & his librettists were to view it with the sound turned off (& without the introductory title & subtitles), they'd have no idea that it's ""their work"" being presented.This deliberately outrageous Salzburg Festival production, with its helicopter, robots & a tattooed, rockstarrish Cellini in leather jacket, black T-shirt & jeans, renders the entire onstage enterprise a meaningless melange, with no relevance whatsoever to the historical time, place & characters the opera is about.That said, the soloists, chorus, conductor & orchestra are all outstanding, performing with brilliance, high spirits & unflagging energy. They, as well as Berlioz & his librettists, the premium-paying Salzburg audience &, of course, we, the DVD-buying opera-loving public, all deserved better than this mindless Eurogarbage."
3,Entertaining for sure!,"This production definitely gives you a sense of awe and spectacle. There is never a dull moment. I was truly impressed with the sheer production value of this opera.The performances given by this cast were truly tremendous...given with high energy and vocal clarity.While I enjoyed the production, it doesn't seem like it would've been what the composer had intended at all for his show. Doesn't really seem appropriate for the style/period of which the composer wrote for."
3,Good Book,"Good book on the uses of yogurt cheese, the recipes are good, nothing exceptional. It can be the first step to learn how to make and how to cook with yochee."
4,Follow Up to Nighthawk,"It took me a couple of years to get back to this to read it. I didn't think that this was better than Nighthawk, but it was still Very Good... I was also glued to this book and did not want to put it down. I'm not into this scene, but it is still Very Erotic Reading... It will either turn you On, or Off. If nothing else, it will definetly expand your horizons...."
4,Pastry bag kit..,Good starter kit... works well so far.. only use it for making deviled eggs to get that nice star effect..
3,You really can't overfill,It's hard to twist the bag to keep the filling coming front coming out the wrong way. Going with disposable bags.
3,back cover summary,"from the back cover of the September 1994 Ace paperback editionTwo years ago, Cass, Moke, and Dosh acted in a cyber-film to make enough money to get off-planet. The studio plugged them into an adventure script, one that left Dosh dead - and Cass and Moke fleeing for their lives.But Cass and Moke have done well for themselves, and the horrors of their past are safely buried. Or are they? Someone's sent Cass a vidclip of the latest hit cyber-film - starring an actor who bears a striking resemblance to Dosh. Too striking. So Cassandra's coming back. For answers. And revenge.And this time, she's writing the script..."
1,Wrong Image,"Restockit support handled the situation promptly and without cause, for that I'm grateful. but ultimately, the image (at least at the time of purchase and this review) that's associated with this item is incorrect. The image shows a shelf with built in brackets for a rackmount. However the item itself is simply two right angled brackets that appear to be for a specific piece of equipment. if that is what you're looking for, then disregard the low rating, but if you're looking for a mountable shelf, this is not the right product despite the image."
5,Wonderful & educational,"My toddler loves this show. It is colorful, produced well, educational, good morals, and written well. It is better than Thomas the train."
1,No written text; strictly drawings & sketches.,"Just so you know, this thing is a collection of sketches by various artists who've worked on this character (or submitted art for possible consideration.) There's no written text. This can only be called ""by Neil Gaiman"" in the sense that he created the character. Some of the art has been previously published, some not. To be quite frank, I found it far less compelling than the art that has already been published in the Sandman and Death graphic novellas. IMHO, for the completist only."
1,Save your money!!,"If you are looking for a CD with nothing but crickets chirping and other such sounds, with absolutely no music, go ahead and buy this CD. If you are seeking a CD with music, STOP!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY.....RUN!!!!!!"
1,"Alternative/hip/trendy, but no insights or useful information","This product gets 1 star for being current and interactive, but it didn't tell me anything I don't already know -- at least anything that's actually useful, interesting or helpful. You'll do just as well to wander around Berlin on your own, without seeing this rather strange travelogue. It was hardly worth the time to go through it, let alone paying approximately $20. My best description of it is that it could easily be loaded on any hotel room TV in Berlin for free viewing."
5,Good for Multiple Readings,"As a kid I loved this book. It's not about the Black, it's not about Satan, it's not about Flame. It's about what seems to be an unexciting form of racing: sulky racing. It's about characters we haven't met before in this series, including Tom Messenger and a colt named Bonfire. The story gripped me from the start, and I learned So Much about harness racing that all my friends came to me with questions about it. I learned so much about harness racing that I went to state fairs just to watch the horses race while pulling sulkies. This is an exciting story and introduces readers to a whole new world of horses and racing."
3,Glamourized tale of harness racing,"and improbable.Like the rest of the Black Stallion series the book is highly fictionalized.Any progeny of the ""Black Stallion"" would not be allowed to race ""legally"" either under saddle or in harness.Terms are used loosely.Harness racing is hard on the trainers and even harder on the horses.While I am a fan of both flat racing and harness racing the book is better left to the young. Who I hope someday learn the way it really is."
1,This will ruin your life,"Our office has this fax machine and it makes everything more difficult. It cannot just take one page at a time--ever, in any circumstance. It jams constantly; it LIES (the fax receipts are not accurate); and it makes our customers call us, outraged that they've spent 20 minutes trying to fax two pages to us.If you typically receive one page faxes from local numbers, this machine may be okay for your needs.If you require a functional machine that can actually handle its ONLY PURPOSE IN EXISTENCE, this machine may not be for you."
3,Will not print with 64 bit Windows 7,"I bought this printer for its laser print qualities. My previous printer didn't feed pages properly and this one doesn't either but that's not a big deal for me as I send very few multiple page faxes. When I do, I just feed one page at a time. Receiving faxes, or copying, it feeds properly. The print quality is excellent, print speed is OK, and it's reasonably priced.My biggest problem is that I cannot print from my computers that run 64 bit Windows 7. There is no driver available, a major inconvenience. I contacted Canon and they referred me to one of their technicians. He did not believe Canon would write a 64 bit driver for Windows 7 as they did not write a driver for 64 bit Vista!"
1,"Poor drivers, feed jams, error recovery is nonsensical","The sheet feeder pulls multiple sheets at once, which is really fun when you're sending a fax. When it jams, which will happen very very frequently, it gives no audible alarm whatsoever. When you clear *any* fault, including out of paper, you need to hit the ""reset"" button. No clear indication is given of this in the printer status on the OS, only on the barely-readable LCD.Canon appears to have no intention to support anything but 32 bit windows for this printer, ever. If you have Vista 64-bit or Windows 7, this printer is an expensive paperweight."
1,Not Compatible with 64 Bit Computers,"This is not compatible with 64 bit computers, and Canon, the Manufacturer does not have an updated version of the installation software present on their website. I want to return the product for the above reason."
4,Bought this to replace same model that finally died,Bought this to replace same model that finally died. It is a worthy machine and meets the needs of our office perfectly. This model also holds more paper than newer models which is what we need.
1,Will not run on Windows 7,If you have Windows 7 or are about to buy a computer with Windows 7 forget this printer. Less than a year old and now I need another printer.
3,Dumb design,"My office just bought one of these, and while I wasn't involved in the purchase or setup, I can attest to one thing. Do you see the large, metal ring in front of the machine? That's where your outbound faxes are supposed to collect. We had the Canon sitting on a countertop with this ring protruding halfway off the edge, and without fail, every page landed on the floor. It's useless. We now have the machine turned sideways with our own, homemade ""collector"" sitting in front. It's not a fatal flaw, but certainly a dumb design, and perhaps not best for tight spaces or for offices that want to appear slick."
4,working fine,I bought this machine on price and have not be disappointed. The printing is very good and the machine is very quite when printing. (My old HP deskjet sounds like a tank compared to this.) One thing I do not care for is the ring tones for incoming faxes. There is no way to make it quiet. Other than that we have been satisfied with the purchase and looking at the cost of a toner cartridge compared with an HP inkjet cartridge for the amount of pages printed be cartridge the new machine should pay for itself in two years.
1,Great if you don't need to fax more than one page.,"I bought this fax machine mistakenly thinking that a FAX MACHINE would be better at FAXES than an all in one printer/scanner/fax/copier.I cannot fax more than one page at a time without standing at the machine and manually feedind the pages through, because when left alone, it constantly sucks in two or four pages at a time.If you build a fax machine - Shouldn't it be able to fax more than one page? Too much to ask?"
4,Canon L80 faxphone,This is the workhorse of our small surgical office. What a great price this time! Very satisfied.
2,This fax is nothing but trouble,We get nothing but paper jams on outgoing as well as incoming. You can never do a multiple page fax as many pages go through. I literally have to hand feed any multiple page fax and make sure it goes through. Most times I have to send it twice. I would not buy this machine ever. It is going in the trash as soon as my new one comes in.
2,bad on multiple pages,"I own a small business and give mine a fairly heavy workout. The machine started and has always pulled multiple pages (I have tried diff paper types) when faxing. We have always needed to stay there and feed one page at a time, talk about a time killer for 20 page documents! After a year, it has started pulling multiple sheets from the feeder when printing. I guess I should get off a couple of dollars for a new one. I love Canon and this is the first bad product I have received from them but it is bad, real bad. I may stay with Canon but certainly not this product."
1,Absolute Junk,"I purchased this model around 6 months ago, and the problems continue every day. This machine won't fax multiple pages...instead it likes to pull the whole 5 or 6 page set through at once, thus jamming and causing headache. Secondly, the machine likes to jam up while receiving. I am not the only one I know with these problems.I wasted good money on this product and I would suggest you not do the same. Now I'm off to buy a new one of a different model; the old Canon got a swipe of the sledgehammer."
2,Feeds more than one sheet at a time.,"I think the most frustrating thing about a fax machine, is when you put your four or five page fax into the feeder, and the machine sucks two or three sheets at once ruining your whole fax! I especially got this machine because I thought it was a quality machine, and wouldn't do that, but I was wrong. Sometimes this machine sucks more than one sheet at a time which is very frustrating. I would stay away. It prints nicely, but it doesn't help if it ruins your faxes. I see other reviewers have the same problem."
1,Don't waste your money,"We bought this because we wanted to be able to send a 10+ page fax well. It constantly pulls more than one page if you have under 5 pages...this results in you haveing to hold each page separate until the one before it gets sucked up. The most annoying thing is that it doesn't hold much paper and is constantly running out if you don't frequently check it. AND! once the paper runs out, We have a hard time getting a new stack of paper to load. I keeps saying load paper, and you jiggle the stack around and it rotates the roller but never sucks up a new piece and keeps showing ""Load Paper"" I will fiddle with it for about twenty min. before it grabs the first page and works properly. Needless to say I am searching for a new machine and when I find one I am throwing this the L80 into the lake at the next ""Load Paper""."
2,Feeds more than one page at a time,I am surprised to see positive feedback for this fax machine. Ours frequently takes in more than one page at a time when sending a fax so I aways need to hold on to all but the bottom page to keep all pages from all going through. I find this machine very frustrating.
4,Good machine for the price,"Overall the machine has pretty good features, including its ability to double as a laser printer and super G3 technology. However, I do have a few problems:- Papers tend to stick together when scanning- Scans tend to become crooked since the input tray can not lock at the letter size- Print outs tend to be crooked unless you make sure to pad down the paper in the output tray and make sure they are all aligned properlyOther than that, the machine works great."
1,Incomplete issue,"This book is not what I expected. Contents 99% collection ofblack&white; postcardlike pictures. No interior pictures or written technical info. I paid USD 38.93 incl. overseas shipping-charge to The Netherlands, however, USD 10.00 should be the max I should pay for it in any book-outletstore.CJ van ToornAmsterdam, the Netherlands"
3,"Okay book, but could use a few more ideas","I'm a beginner, and it's good on materials and some techniques; but it lacks ideas. Visually, the book is gorgeous, but maybe they could have used smaller photographs, but more of them."
4,Good for Beginners who wants short workouts of Meghan White's previous releases,"Meghan White's Ultimate Trainer is a compilation DVD of segments from her previous releases such as Ultimate Challenging Workout, Ultimate Beginning Workout and Pilates Sculpt & Tone. This would be a good start for someone who is a beginner and new to Meghan.You can mix and match segments to make it a shorter or longer workout. Personally, since I already have her Ultimate Body series then I don't have use for this since I prefer the full length workouts and not shortened versions."
3,"Problems, but still cute","These little guys are super cute. I can't describe them as ""Lighted and Musical"" because I have never gotten them to be either. They have no real instructions so I can't figure out what is missing but they have no power. The other problem is they smelled awful and were sticky when they arrived. It might have to do with the plastic used to make them. I kept them in the basement for a couple weeks to air out and they are fine now. So overall they are not quite what I expected but luckily they still cute."
3,great music but defective,"I am very happy with Helmut Lotti goes classic Blue Album and I recommend it highly I would give it 5 stars. But I can only watch the performance by selecting each song individually, as the concert selection will not play. So I am somewhat dissapointed but figure it would be a big hassle to get a new one and return the defective one."

2,"great reviews on many websites, but . . .",I haven't noticed any marked increase in energy or recuperation over good nutrition or choice energy packed foods before going to the gym. I'll take a PBJ sandwich over the Pak any day for energy sustenance.
1,These DVD's appear to work until you try to read them,"Purchased a spindle of 25 of these and they appeared to work great. Then I tried to read the data from them. I tried several DVD burners including the ones I wrote these with and most would read the first 60-65% then fail reading the balance of the DVD. Some would not read at all. I got the same results with DVD readers.Tried to get support from Khypermedia concerning the problem and all they wanted to do was have me ship them to them so they could send me more. Since I had used TDK, MEMOREX, and FUJI DVD's with Sony, NEC, and Optorite burners without a problem I wasn't willing to pay shipping to receive more bad DVD's.You have been warned!"
4,Modelling Financial Times Series - Stephen Taylor,Very good book. Covers the most important subjects on financial time series modelling. It is written in a very didactic way. Easy to understand. I recommend.Modelling Financial Times Series
3,DJZ,"While I am not a Christian, I enjoyed every one of these books. I also enjoyed ""The Indwelling"". I agree that they are not the greatest books ever written. They are, however, very readable and entetaining. Sure, there are many coincideces, but hey, these are God's chosen! I have zipped through each book within 2 or 3 days. A sure sign that they are compelling. I haven't changed my religion, but I did enjoy these books on their merits. Even if you are not a religious person these books are enjoyable."
1,I didn't get what i ordered,I ordered this set and when it arrived in the mail it was a paper copy of a book in the series that I already had! Was not happy with my response from the company. I chalk this up to one of those one time bad deals. Amazon did a great job of making sure my money was returned to me. Kudos to Amazon.
5,excellent,"Everyone should read this. If you aren't a believer, you will be. We are anxiously awaiting number 7! (My copies are getting tattered as everyone is borrowing them! Sincerely, Tena."
4,"Good books, but inaccurate...","First off, I think the books are great! The charactors and the story line is great. However, when comparing these books to Revelations, the books are very inaccurate. But, there are some things that are exactly the same as Revelations describe. If you want a good, fictional book, these are great! If you're looking for the truth about what the Bible really says, these aren't going to help much. A little, but not exactly. The books are great though! I think they're worth reading. They've made me more interested in the end times and what's going to happen, which has made me turn to my Bible a lot more, seeking answers. I hope this helped! :-)"
5,Left Behind Series,These books are full of suspense and keep you on edge with every page. I can hardly wait for the Indwelling to come out. These books are a general topic at my work place. The ones I have have been read over and over by all my friends. I be there in line first for the next one.
5,FANTASTIC READ!,"This is a fantastic read! I've managed to work through the first 4 books in less than 2 months. It's a well written and exciting series. The only part I disagree with is the notion of the Rapture. According to the Bible, there is no such thing as the ""Rapture"". It is not ONCE mentioned in the Bible or any concordance. If you read all of Matthew 24, you will notice that starting at verse 20, there is description of the Tribulation and the Great Tribulation and THEN AFTER those times, the Lord will come back. The notion of the rapture reads that Jesus will come and take the true Christians and then come back again...which in essence makes this 3 times. That is false. I think the books are entertaining and do write about truth in the seals, trumpets, and judgments but the beginning basis of the book I do not agree with. I'm still giving it 5 stars though because I love a good story!"
4,"Good, decent case","This case does a decent job in protecting your TT racket. The zipper is smooth and the cushioning is fairly ok to give adequate protection. However, if you are having a slightly over-sized racket or a thick handle, this case might be a bit too tight. It would have been great if this case had a strap. Overall good value for money and Amazon as ever shipped it super fast!"
1,Inaccurate description,"If you read the description of this product it clearly states that this item has a zippered pouch for carrying balls. The case I received looks like the one pictured but did not come with a zippered pouch. When I went to return it for what I ordered, Amazon would only issue a refund. Buyers beware, this description is inaccurate and misleading."
3,Serves its purpose,Very functional and of high quality materials. Show last for a long time if I don't lose it. Good for a single bat.
2,Cover does the job but there's better,"The Butterfly is a normal TT racket case with a foam protective layer. It protects the racket from typical dust and rubbing about on things but if you have a nice racket, a hard case is recommended."
4,"good phone, could be better.","The phone is a good phone. Great size, it easily fit in your pocket. More durable than the razr. Has a slightly better camera than razr. Stores and plays Itunes music. Biggest problem is that unless you hold the phone right to your mouth they can't hear you on the other end of the phone. That gets frustrating. Has bluetooth so you can aviod that issue in car or with ear piece."
3,Good for beginners on a taught course,"This book makes a reasonable start on the Finnish language for beginners, but is entirely written in Finnish, so is of little use without a teacher. The chapters are reasonably focused and graspable. The book's main drawback is that is uses a mono-spaced font which makes it visually unappealing and tiring to read."
5,Makes you question your beliefs.,"Reading this book is like being on acid without the LSD. The concepts and theories make you really think about what it means to be human and what our true motivations are. As someone who has straddled the fence on evolution and creation, I found the author's views a little critical of the religious establishment, yet nonetheless painfully logical.The idea about the mind transmitting to a subconscious relay network had me spinning as I applied the idea to previous wondering of why my wife and I call each other at the same time so often. It's off the wall but makes so much sense.My only complaint is that the book was so short. I loved the book and hope MH Weiss writes some more."
5,Great video!,I decided to try and workout during this pregnancy. This video is a great workout. It is easy to follow and definitely challenging.
5,Great workout!,I am in my 2nd trimester and I am really enjoying this workout video! It is not too fast paced but fast enough to get your heart pumping and get a good lower body workout. I am not bored with it! I highly recommend this workout video to pregnant women who are wanting to stay in shape.
4,Pleasantly surprised,"Great workout. Not to intense, but you feel like you've done something. She's very reassuring and relaxed. Like that the ""studio"" is her living room, so you feel like you're right at home and that you're doing the right thing in your own living space. Got a Post-natal DVD too. Well worth it!"
5,I love Erin!,"Complete Pregnancy Fitness with Erin O'BrienI'm online now looking for more of Erin's workouts. Both the prenatal and postnatal workouts were very managable for me to do. More than anything, they gave me peace and I felt like I was doing something for my mind and body. Erin has an awesome attitude and is not annoying to me like a lot of instructors can be. I felt like I was working out with a friend (sound weird, but true!). I like how the postnatal has 3 progressions to build your strength gradually.LOVE IT!"
3,Alright,"This DVD set is okay, though it doesn't feel very professional. It really is filmed in her living room and the camera work and lighting are not at the professional level of most other exercise DVDs. It's a bit expensive for the quality. The workouts are good. I was challenged and the gal is a good leader. The partner workout basically used the man as a prop. He doesn't get to do much. If you are looking for a workout specifically designed for pregnancy, this will do just fine. But if you are in tune with your body, just about any exercise tape will do the trick. It's just up to you to adjust it to your needs."
5,Excellent DVD!,This is the best fitness dvd I've tried and I think I've tried them all! It's a good workout but not too vigorous. It wouldn't be a great dvd for someone who hasn't been working out before becoming pregnant though. You need to be in pretty decent shape to keep up.
4,Overall Great workout video,"I really like this video for the prenatal workout. I really like how she is really down to Earth and doesn't make you feel really out of shape, because she is panting right along with you. The exercises are easy, yet effective. She also uses a great variety of workouts including some yoga and pilates."
5,My favorite pregnancy workout DVD,"I ordered 5 pregnancy workout DVD's from Amazon and this is my favorite one. Erin is easy to listen too - not annoying at all. I was in pretty good shape pre-pregnancy so I like that this keeps my heart going. I also like the 40 minute timeframe...not too long not to short. My husband and I also did the 20 minute partner workout which is a great short workout. We laughed because some of the positions are a little awkward, but it was fun. I really enjoy this DVD and hope you will too!"
5,Pregnancy Fitness DVD,"I did not know what to expect from a pregnancy fitness dvd but I am very happy I bought this product. It has 2 dvds, a prenatal fitness and a postnatal fitness dvd. I haven't looked at the postnatal one yet but the prenatal dvd kicks my butt every time. I would definitely recommend this product."
5,Great Video!,"I looked for a long time for a decent prenatal exercise video. I was on the low end of a moderate activity level before I got pregnant. I enjoy a good workout but had gotten out of the ""habit."" I was afraid to go back to my Turbo Jam for fear that it would be too intense to restart during pregnancy. I am currently 19 weeks pregnant and feel that this video is perfect for my fitness level at this time. It makes me feel good that I've done a workout but I do not get winded and overheated. It is a good video for me to ""get used"" to working out again and build up to a higher intensity level."
4,I like it!,"I like this video very much. In my first trimester I was too sick and tired to even think about exercise. This video was a nice way to ease back into a routine. The exercises are clearly explained and challenging enough for a recovering couch potato. I like that Erin is actually pregnant and that the focus is on building a strong, healthy body rather than staying skinny during pregnancy. The workout is low pressure, but I break a sweat and feel like my muscles are working. If you are extremely fit, you might find the workout too easy. For a fit-ish person who walks regularly and works out a few times a week, I think this video is great. There are a few elements to the production quality I could live without (music is a little weird in the beginning,80's style camera shots here and there, some cheesy jokes) but anything can be critiqued. This video is good where it counts."
4,"Very fun, very real instructor","This is a great pregnancy workout. Low impact, but high energy. The instructor is very real and has so much energy. She isn't annoying like some fake-smiling workout instructors. I rate it so high because of the instructor's energy, but I don't really like the filming. It seems like she was experimenting with different ways to film the workout, but in some portions you can see a weird outline of something in front of what you are viewing - almost like a watermark. It can get a little annoying at times. However, besides that one minor annoyance, I really enjoy this workout and find myself coming back to it regularly. There is a section where she works your butt while you are on the floor, and it KILLS the next day (in a good way). If you are looking for a high-energy workout that is low impact, this one is a great choice."
3,EHHH,"I want to like this DVD, but the way it's filmed is just weird. It would be like me having someone film me working out in my living room. Ultimately the workout is a good one though, I just have difficulty overlooking the film quality. She really focuses on legs & glutes in this DVD, not much in the way of arm workout. There's better prenatal DVD's out there for sure."
3,Not very challenging,"This is an ok workout, but I didn't find it challenging enough. Probably good for beginners or those in their third trimester. I bought it for my first pregnancy and probably won't use it much with my second pregnancy. I'm a runner, running about 3-4 times a week, and do workout dvds at home twice a week. I just wanted more of a workout, especially in the beginning. Oh and I never used the postnatal workout. I tried it once and just turned it off. By the time I was ready to start working out again, I again wanted more of a challenge. There is also little cardio, it's more of strength training dvd. Good luck and hope this helps!"
2,Great for beginners,"This DVD would be a great workout for beginners. For someone who is very active and used to Insanity/p90x/bob Harper workouts, this DVD is pretty boring. Maybe it would be a good workout to do on a resting day. I didn't really like the homemade feel to the video; the lighting and effects were somewhat annoying."
4,Great for all fitness levels....,This a great workout no matter what your fitness level is. I enjoy using the tape and will continue throughout my pregnancy. It was a fun workout and you can feel it working as well. I liked her personality too.
3,Just ok,"It has been a particular challenge for me to find prental workout dvds that were safe, fun, and challenging. This did not fit the bill. It is just ok. I am pregnant, not an invalid, and I want to feel worked out when I have done so. If this had more reps of each exercise it would be better. Not for ladies who are int/adv or better; more suitable for beginners or low intermediates. I like Erin's demeanor and the video itself (no complaints about the ""homemade quality"" of production as some). It just isn't for me."
1,Cannot play this DVD in Australia,"I'm sure this is a great dvd, but after waiting almost 2 months for it to be delivered to Australia I have discovered it does not play here (due to the region). Very disappointing and frustrating. Do not buy this if you are ordering from Australia, unless you have a multi-region dvd player or computer on which to watch it (which I don't). There was nothing on the description of the dvd on amazon website to explain that it would not play in Australia."
1,Sick and twisted thinking about pregnancy and natal care,"This lady seems to think of pregnancy as something to fix and get past as quickly as possible. From her blog:""The main reasons to continue exercising through your pregnancy include: 1) Less weight gained = less weight to take off after the baby is born 2) You will have a smaller baby, which is easier to give birth to 3) You will endure labor better.""Is she concerned about her looks or about her baby? I can't tell."
3,This workout should come with a little warning,"This is a really thorough, challenging work out. It's filmed in kind of a funny way, but once you figure out what's going on, you get over that. The reason I gave it three stars is because it might not be the best PRENATAL work out. She is constantly talking about ""getting your heart rate up,"" when you need to be cautious about your heart rate during pregnancy. My heart rate easily got to 150 during the dynamic movement section of the video. My midwife recommends no higher than 130. If you are in really excellent shape pre-pregnancy, then you might be fine. I was in pretty good shape, but doing this video full out is too much and makes my heart rate too high. If you weren't exercising much at all pre-pregnancy, this video is definitely not for you."
3,Too much talking,"I think I like the work-out o.k. I like quick, hard workouts and I have started this 2ce and haven't made it through. My complaint is there is too much talking before it actually starts, even comments during the workout get a little annoying. She is cute, but I can't bear to watch the whole intro every time so I sit and sit and FF! I'm in my first tri-mester and want to stay active. Hopefully I like it more the more I try it."
2,what was i thinking horrible audio,the video quality is pretty bad especially the audio very echoey..the workouts are literally shoot in her living room kinda basically a home production video that anyone with a computer and camera can make..wish the audio was a better so the video can be watchable...the workouts seem to be creditable but audio is so annoying that it will make this video a dust collector
4,Good deal for prenatal work out set,"First to note, 1 of the 2 DVDs that come with this set is Erin's Prenatal Fitness Fix. I accidentally bought that one as well and had to return. I have not yet tried the post delivery work out DVD yet, but the prenatal is a decent workout."
3,Good workout,This is like a made home video with good excercises. I am not a fan of Erin's style (as a teacher) and the way the video has been done (poor luminosity and not a good edition) but the workout is good and very well explained. We can understand why we should do this or that excercise and what group of muscles we are woking out (which is important).I recommend this dvd.
5,you will break a sweat,"I like this dvd a lot, it does work you out!, even when you are pregnant!. I bought it to do it on days when I didn't feel like running or when it is rainning and I have found myself doing it quite frequently.I cannot comment on the partner part yet. However, I' quite happy with the individual part, so I don't know when I'll be trying the partner video."
5,A reviewer,"If you're a woman, you need to read this book. If you're a man, you need to read this book. It's for anyone going through a beginning journey, mid-journey, or elder journey, so full of wisdom, play, hope, guidance, and just plain simple answers to difficult questions. This book really touched me at a deep level. I'm giving it to all my friends."
3,Mystery Not Solved,"Research slanted and having done research find many pointsthat could have been researched in depth. Title does notstand up to the contents. Those looking for 'a mystery solved,'will be sorely disappointed."
1,VERY Disappointed!,"I owned an Estate Wine Bottle Opener for about 20 years, during which time it successfully and easily opened many bottles of wine and was a beautiful conversation piece in my kitchen. A few weeks ago, after all that time, the auger snapped off. As I had been so satisfied with the previous model, I did not hesitate to purchase another. Now I am EXTREMELY disappointed!!! The previous reviewer is correct in that it more often than not forces the cork down into the bottle of wine!! It appears as if they have changed the design, especially of the auger. It seems too wide and flat on the end to smoothly pierce into the cork before the action of the mechanism pushes it down. Very sad that a quality product is not being produced anymore."
1,Doesn't work at all!,"This expensive and attractive opener isn't worth anything as it DOES NOT WORK to open wine bottles at all. The auger is wide and thick and cannot pierce the cork. Instead, the auger 90% of the time PUSHES the cork down into the bottle. It also takes a huge amount of effort to get the auger to work its way into the cork (or pushing down the cork). DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS OPENER! The company says it sells ""hundreds"" of these every year, but I wonder if anyone ever uses it! They will not refund your money as they don't sell it directly...so you have to request a refund through the vendor you purchased it from. DON'T BUY AT ANY PRICE!!"
1,Wine Opener,"Opener does not work, could not get it to open one bottle. Returned it after spending $40 in shipping. Not only that, but it does not look like the picture, no wooden handle!"
4,Great Book for beginning pig parents.,"Having just acquired our first piglet, we were looking for all types of information about these animals. We found this book answers just about all of the questions we have had to this point. In fact, this is probably all the 'pig book' we will need for a long time. We highly recommend this book to anyone just starting out. Lots of information in great detail for beginning pig owners."
1,"No ac adapter included, require 4 C cell battery","I ordered this speaker because it's cheap and review seemsOK. However, to my surprise, it need 6V ac adapter butdoes not include it. Or it can use 4 C cell batteries (notAA or AAA) but also does not include them. Without batteryor ad adapter, the sound is so small. But if include theprice of an ac adapter or the batteries, this speaker isnot cheap at all. Not recommend it."
3,Annoying leading character!!!,"Katy Orville is an umemployed tech writer, and heads to England to ""find her best self."" She meets this tall, muscled, handsome farmer that right away expresses his attraction to her, but she's holding out for something more. Will the farmer, who is really a duke, has a slender, playboy jerk of a cousin who pursues Katy to annoy Will. Time and again Katy, with her insecure, seeking-to-belong self, goes out with Trevor, the cousin, because she can't get over wanting to be in the ""in"" crowd. The writing is good, and the storyline is entertaining, but I cannot sympathize with this irritating twenty-four year old that's stuck in a ""high school"" need to fit in. I would have rated this book higher had I liked Katy even a little bit."
1,Unable to finish it- someone slap her with the glass shoe!,"This book was annoying and tedious. The Oprah joke was funny the first time, after that just annoying. Here we have a spineless, selfish little twit who can't see a decent person when he practically runs her over. Most of us would have swept him up and the dog and been perfectly happy. NOOO she has to turn into an even more annoying character by getting a makeover into tart of the year while chasing the super rich. You're not rich, you're an average, everyday girl take the average everyday man (he might be a prince in disguise). I was too upset to wait until the end. Just skip this one."
5,Very Handy book to have,This book makes diving into the world of cooking with spices easy and you learn all kinds of things about the spices. Its a good read.
2,more for the beginner cook,I was disappointed. I wanted more advance info on favor combining and folklore. It made me realize I need to see more of a book before I make a purchase.It was okay as far as it went so I gave it two stars because it would interest a beginner cook.
5,Eye-opening,"This is truly an enlightening book. I was amazed to find how frequently errors occur. Many, if not most, could easily be avoided if simple precautions were taken. It is really sad that we don't demand more from our medical facilities and government in this area. We as consumers/patients are denied information that would perhaps change our decisions regarding the doctors we choose and the facilities we use. No one is held accountable when mistakes happen. This kind of policy makes it almost impossible for real change to happen in healthcare. I hope this book inspires people to take issue with the problems and lobby for change.This book also gives great advice on what to do to prevent medical errors from happening to you or a loved one."
5,A Better Book By Far,"This is a better book by far than the unfortunately better known INTERNAL BLEEDING. It is certainly more honest. It has the clear advantage of being written by people who know and understand the subject ,and unlike Internal Bleeding, it does not suffer the disadvantage of having been written by physicians who, purposfully or otherwise, seem very intent in obscuring the responsibility for medical mistakes.The authors of Wall of Silence have written an honest and valuable book deciding (to the public's advantage) to let the chips fall where they may. A MUST READ!!"
2,Great hedge small story,"This book, like all travel books should have been supplied with maps that would enable the reader to follow, at least in a general way the authors journey searching for the great hedge. The one map in the book is totally insufficient. The most interesting part of the book was that dealing with the salt tax but even there it sometime seemed like filler. Like the small remains found of the hedge there is not enough here to justify any thing more than a good size magazine article."
5,Very speedy delivery,"This book arrived a lot sooner than I expected, and it was in wonderful condition. What more could you ask for??? Thanks,"
4,Not the best,If your getting started with this thinks this is a good beginning. its not the strongest but it certainly works.
5,Lives up to the first,Great!!!!! This is the second book I've read by Trisha Baker and It dosent disopoint. From start to finish she keeps you guessing as to what's going to happen. When the book ends it leaves you wanting to know more. I wished it dident have to end. Read this book!!! You will not regret it!!
5,I Even Did the Laundry to Stretch out the Ending,"I absolutely loved this book, and even sent an email link for my daughter to read it. It had desire in the tons, but it certainly is not a lusty book.The characters were decent, honorable, hard-working people and they pulled at my heart strings in their efforts to find love and a good enduring life.I would have paid a lot more than the $3.82 on Kindle for this book.I found every excuse in the world to prolong finishing it. I even did the laundry so I could stretch out the ending a little....and that says a lot. It was a full page novel, but still, I wish it had been longer, or perhaps had an epilog.Bravo Ms St.John! Well done."
4,Word of the day,"For this book- word of the day- miscommunication. Neither one of these guys seemed to like to talk much. She so afraid, him thinking the worst. I enjoyed the read, it was different- and different is good."
4,"Light, Easy Read","I liked both of the main characters and the story moves along nicely. This is my first book by this author, and I plan to read another. It was a ""gentle love story"", no steamy hot scenes in this book. Plus no strange plot, but realistic thoughts and ideas. A nice read on a rainy afternoon."
5,His best,"The flavor of this CD is a blend of punk rock and disco. And may I add, what a blend! ""You Win - I Lose"" is one of my all time favorite tunes, he captures the sense of male/female interaction like no other artist. His song ""Millionaire"" is a fast pace sample of she's on her own track but who cares, not me. I am bias because I have been listening to this music sense its release in the '70s but I feel it will blend into anyone's music collection who likes fast paced vocals ."
5,MUST READ - Life After Layoff,"Life After Layoff is a 'must read' for anyone who is experienc ing being laid off from his or her job, especially for the first time. It provides an insightful look at the emotional as well as practical aspects of being laid off from work and how to overcome a frequently paralyzing fear of being out of work. Dr.'s Van Ness and Donohue present real people in situations that we can all relate to and practical advice on how to move on with your professional and personal life. I was particularly impressed with their chapter on how to think outside the box with career alternatives. Instead of just looking for a ""job"", they teach you how to create work opportunities that are more fulfilling and rewarding, including starting your own business doing something that you love."
2,Avoid This Version......,"This is just a rehash of the old Lion's Gate version that was cut beyond belief. If you really want to see this film there is an affordable ""Director's Cut"" available from Tartan Video in England and available from Amazon.UK. All you need is a DVD player that can play PAL (a surprising number of low-end DVD players will do the conversion). You can google your model and see if it will handle PAL broadcast format. You can order the Brit DVD here:http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wild-Side-DVD-Christopher-Walken/dp/B000050GOU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s;=dvd&qid;=1247449628&sr;=8-2Just don't bother with any of the current US releases."
1,"Wild Side - no, actually mild side....",This title is not the original theatrical release of Wild Side. The original release was 111 minutes and the runtime of the DVD is slightly more than 90 minutes.The transfer is acceptable - however the chaptering was poorly done.
2,wildside DVD,I had seen this movie previously on VHS and the DVD version seems to have deleted a couple of scenes (or at least one scene) and soI was disapointed.
3,Missing scene,"It's a great movie, but was not aware the a scene has been taken out. so insted of the movie being 111 minutes it was 95 minutes"
2,More critical then helpful,Mostly one criticism after another of everyone elses books. He may be correct at timesbut offers only some strong opinions to back it up. Never does he provide any stats nor real life encounters of those who have utilized his methods.
5,Common Sense Defense,Ralph Mroz has joined the ranks of those counted amongst the top firearms/defensive tactics writers currently out there. I own several of his books and have enjoyed both his perspective and common sense approach to things.
5,New Directions for Scientific and Heart-centered Medicine,"Every chapter of this well-written and thoroughly researched book will excite the inquiring mind. The author has written about highly technical new research in a readable and engaging manner. The material describes research of recent decades that will revolutionize future healing methods. The 21st century will be the century of energy medicine, without abandoning biochemical methods. Dr.Oschman has explored the scientific basis for many so-called complementary healing methods, such as Reiki, Therapeutic Touch, Polarity Therapy.It is a seminal book that will be read and discussed for many years to come."
5,Wow I always new good things were happening,"Dr Oschman's ""Energy Medicine: The Scientific Basis"", has put the ""science"" into what I have experienced.This is a must read for all those energy healers who also like to know that it is not all in the head. I couldn't wait to read the next chapter and then the next.Peter Robb DC"
4,very interesting contents for acupuncturitst and biomedicine,This book wrote very interesting contents for acupuncturist and biomedical researchers. what is Energy medicine? this book wrote not difficult! understand easily.
2,Energy Medicine,"The author took too much time explaining science of energy. If you have already read up on energy and the science behind it, this book is repetitive. I prefer Dr Gerber's ""Vibrational Medicine""."
5,Simplicity-it is what it isn't,"Excellent Watch. This Watch is very thin and wears well for its 42mm Case Diameter.Only negatives are the limited fine adjustment of the metal Band;(only two holes in Clasp approx 2.0mm apart)and that the center portion of Band links (where pinned to Case)scratch easily. The Band has metal to metalcontact here and creates a wear line.However, the movement on this Watch is great. Even after only wearing it for maybe an hour or two some days, and then letting it sit on the Dresser, this thing keeps running."
1,Defective watch.,The second hand will not pass minute hand without winding or gentle tap on dial. Will not keep time. Can not be wound automatically or mechanically. Will be returning.
2,Most reflective crystal ever!,"This is no doubt a beautiful watch. If the style has appealed to you from the pictures you've seen of it then you won't be dissapointed by the design as well as the fit and finnish. I however can't get past the glare from the domed sapphire. It is NOT an AR coated sapphire as stated by this seller's product specs, it's also the most reflective sapphire i have ever seen! Not only that their product picture (third one down, angled view from the crown side) is clearly photoshopped without the crystal on, look at the magnified view.I just can't enjoy the watch with this crystal as all the background reflections of the surrounding environment overshadow the dial and hands. Im hoping my local watchmaker can retrofit a mineral crystal... i would be prepared for less scratch resistance for the ability to enjoy the lovey dial of this watch.It's hard to give overall star rating since it's a great watch, im just so disappointed by the glare."
3,Moderate Disappointment,"I like the look and feel of the watch and am pleased with the operation for changing the date at the end of short months. However, I am disappointed with the accuracy of the watch. I was wearing a Seiko automatic watch that was accurate to within about one or two seconds a month (at about 1/3 the price) and assumed that the legendary Swiss quality would be about the same. While the variance is not all that bad in the absolute sense, it seems to gain about 10 seconds per week and I am not happy about that."
1,bad quality,"I bought two and one came with bad crown..Really poor quality control. sounds like 40$ junk watch. I searched ""Hamilton crown problem"" found that many people have the same problem with crown. Guys who owning a Hamilton watch with 2824-2 movement should watch out your crown! Hamilton should call back!"
4,good buy,I had a surprisingly tough time finding a BASIC bow case. Grab this one while you can. Constructed pretty well and seems like it will last.
4,just small goofs,"They improved the excessive triples in the '06 version but still have minor glitches in the throwing of the ball after an out. Pujols or Kennedy or anyone will throw to short when throwing around the horn and consistently throw it past and into the outfield. Players tend to run through defenders and on a ground ball hit through 2nd base, the umpire should be without his...groin area apparatus. But other than these minor problems it is a great to play game. Playing the season is lots of fun and a challenge."
3,I rather keep stuck to the 06 version,Nice advance concerning to the AI ..Nice ads with the pitching efeciency and the control of each pitching. The interface tends to lag a lot when you hit the ball and you barely have time to react to the ball when you are fielding. The way you see the ball when hit in the 06 version was nice..They should not have touched that part...You almost have to learn again how to throw and catch the ball to master this..I think they did it on purpose to increase the sales of the PS3 where this game should run fanstastic....Tony Rojas.
4,A great baseball game!!!,Its a great baseball game!!! My son and I have played some of the two player stuff and I am doing the single player career mode. Its been alot of fun. I would give it the max stars but that would state it is prefect which is just not possible. So it got four stars. :) Five stars for fun. :)
5,Fixes most problems from last year,"If you are into sports video games, then you should know by now that you should never expect a game to be vastly better than it's counterpart from the year before. MLB 07 The Show is not. However, nearly all of the gameplay glitches have been dealt with and fixed, and some nice touches such as pitch and location suggestions from the catcher have been added. Throw in a roster update and a revamped ""Road to the Show"" career mode, and this is a baseball game woth buying, especially if you didn't buy the game last year or if you upgraded to the PS3. It is certainly the most realistic baseball game I've played, and I've never even tried the PS3 version!"
3,Fun game.....just the same ol same ol,This is an exact remake of MLB The Show 06. Except for the Confidence Meter and a far better(but difficult)career mode everything else is the same. And there is no Dice-K (he is replaced by some default named Tate Baik damn Players association). His gyroball is there though and it is one of the cheeziest pitches to throw on righties but on lefties if you hang it its gone.
1,Dissappointing,"If you have played any of the EA Sports MVP baseball titles, you're going to hate this game. The graphics are poor, and the controls are difficult. It's unfortunate that EA can no longer produce their MVP baseball series, as it was without a doubt the best for the PS2 platform. The only thing good about this game is the updated rosters. But overall, MLB 2007 just doesn't cut it. It almost takes me back to my days on the N64...days I don't want to go back to!"
5,excellent book,This book shows the hinous lies of the revisionist of 1881 when taking away the last twelve verses of the Mark's Gospel. I am still astonish at the weak or none foundation of these supposedly christians who took the work of changing the Holy Word of God.
5,Love the checklist format!!!!,"This book covers every little detail to planning a wedding in checklist style. When you get all the checks in the box, you will have the wedding of your dreams!"
2,More time consuming than helpful,"There were a lot of lists in this book... too many actually. I'm a serious list person and really thought this book would help me to be efficient, but so many of the items on each list were irrelevant that it was more time consuming than anything else to sift through to the relevant ones. The overall, high-level to do lists were fine, but you could easily find those on any decent wedding planning website like theknot.com."
3,Just OK,"This bag is an OK bag for starting out. I began to acquire more accessories, and needed more space. I was impressed with the quality of the case, but it just was not for me as I advanced. I wish there was a more convenient space for music storage as well as more appropriate reed storage. The front two pockets are great for a metronome, but not quite wide enough for reed boxes."
5,wonderful translation,This music is absolutely beautiful and translated very well from the original score. The pieces are challenging enough to make them pretty and enjoyable and not too difficult for the intermediate pianist.
3,"Great Book, Poor Shipping","I needed this book to help put on part of a school production. I paid extra to have it delivered by a certain date because I needed the book by 9pm that evening. The delivery service did not get it to my door until after 6pm. In addition, the box was in very bad shape: there was a hole in the top of the box and the top was squashed in. Thankfully, the book was only a little bent up and still usable because it was in the very bottom of the box. I was satisfied with the product, but not the shipping.The Book itself was very helpful. The guitar chords were really useful and worth the extra price. The keys in the songs are not the same as the Disney movie, so be careful."
3,Egg coddler,"I do not like this cook wear. I am sorry I bought it. I would not buy another one, but it has nothing to do with Amazon.com. When you cook with this coddler, the egg is difficult to get out, for two reasons. The rim of this unit catches on the egg as it is coming out of the opening, & the egg sticks to the inside of the unit where it cooks, even when using butter."
2,Very Boring....,"Not at all what I had thought this would be about, based upon the reviews. This is very Christian based,which is not a bad thing, but it IS difficult for the reader as it doesn't seem to flow very well, and generally the author presents the material in a rather boring way. The Goddess/Saint has been around eons, and it took me ""eons""to get through this book (yawn). While there was some enlightenment contained within the material, it tended to be foreshadowed by the slow writing style of the author."
1,no info,"I can't find enough technical details to base a decision to buy the product. Have Tech's write the specs, not sales geeks."
5,Refurbished IBM T43 Think Pad,I received the laptop in a short period of time. The unit was in great shape and works just as I would expect. I am very pleased with the purchase and would suggest it to anyone.
1,wtf,This suck I purchase mines and when I try to use it it says operating system not found it be nice to know that I am real disappointed with this purchase I think I want my money back
2,It was not refurbished!,"The laptop was an used, dusty computer. It is working. I did not returned it, but it was not what the vendor offered."
1,Obviously Defective - So Why Send It?,"Nice looking machine, but obviously nobody even looked to see if it worked before sending it to me. #1 - It would not boot up in XP, just froze at every attempt. #2 - the battery would not charge, as clearly shown by the indicator light. I was able to fix the boot-up by going to Safe mode and running Defrag and Scandisk. The battery problem was not fixable - It is simply defective. Despite all the trouble, I'd still like to keep the machine, but there is no option to replace the battery only. There's no ""Contact Seller"" button available for this transaction and all I am left to do is return it. Whole effort - Waste of Time. I Hate Wastes of Time!"
5,Great!!!!!!,This is one of Queens greatest documentaries it should be enjoyed by all Queen fans all around the world. The best to all!
3,Disappointing,"I had this concert on VHS many years ago. I recall thinking it was okay, but Wembley was better. I was looking forward to the blu-ray release in hi-def since it was shot on 35mm film just like Queen Rock Montreal. The picture quality isn't nearly as good as Montreal."
5,Incredible!!!!!,"More than i expected, it's really a must for a Queen fan. Image and sound are really good and the bonus let you see Freddie from another point of view."
5,memorable,"one of many memorable performances and in true Queen form, a must see performance, true Freddie Mercury performance, very memorable"
1,Trash,"These tourniquets are inexcusably poorly made. The first tourniquet I tried to wrap around a test dummy's arm immediately snapped in half. You can make them work if you are very careful with them, but they won't create enough tension, and will snap within 3 or 4 uses. The best word to describe these tourniquets is ""fragile"". Buy something else, these may seem like a deal, but they are a complete rip off."
3,good,I was happy with this product b i dont like going to get blood drawn from me and they are using same tournaquet.
5,Glide doesn't actually clean your teeth,"Seriously. Ask your dentist if Glide is as good as regular waxed dental floss. They'll say no (and tell you that Glide is better than not flossing at all). If you can suffer with slightly less enjoyable floss, do the right thing and get regular ol' waxed floss."
1,pleo dissapointment,"got for my son as a xmas gift, charged it before wrapping it a couple days before, and once it was opened the charge wasnt there....we charged it and it never stayed on that long, and if not constantly touching pleo, he falls asleep...he also never walked...he tried but foot got stuck, so he couldnt. after a couple days, he didnt even work at all....overall...waste of time and money, my son's xmas wasnt as great as i thought it would be."
2,"Initially impressed, would not buy it again.","After 6 months of very sporadic use our Pleo stopped working.All symptoms suggest battery or charger problem.To our surprise, we found out that Pleo is covered by 90 day warranty only.New battery is $50 plus s/h, new charger $25 + s/h, but I am not sure what is broken and I am not willing to spend more money on this thing."
1,Pleo is an expensive hunk of junk,I bought a Pleo for my 4 year old and spent $375 on it. It never worked from the beginning. Who knew when it said it was just waking up that that's all it would ever do. It did gurgle and make a few sounds. The skin color rubbed off immediately. The batteries only worked for five minutes at a time and that is being generous. I bought extra batteries to try to keep it working but you could never tell if they were charged or not. I am writing this review before I throw this most expensive rubber stuffed animal in the garbage. All it ever had going for it is it was cute. Save your money pass on this one.
5,you can get it for a better price,i enjoy shopping at amaon and usually there prices are very good but the price of this pleo is a bit out of line. A popular home shopping chanel(if you understand phonetic alphabet Qubec Victor Charlie)has a brand new pleo listed for $166.00 and shipping is 10.95 or somthing like that. So just wanted to let people know that amazon or its afiliated sites are not always the best price
4,PLEO,"This is a cute little robot, it acts like a puppy so if you would like a mascot with no hassle of cleaning up after it or your building wont allow real pets this is for you :-) the kids love it but be warned, PLEO likes when you pet it but after a while the some of the paint will start to flake and come off but if you like being creative you can repaint it :-p depending on how far you want to take it PLEO can be a great learning tool for programing. Just got my second one, can wait to see how they interact :-)"
5,"Nemo ""Pleo""","My son Jason saw Pleo and had to have it. He saved his money and bought it. It is the perfect pet for him (He has CP and is confined to a wheelchair.) ""Nemo"" is really a majical,lovable ""pet"".His movements are lifelike an you really feel the urge to treat him as though he were alive. The birth process was fascinating and he continues to evolve and amaze us.If you are looking for cute and loveable then pleo is it. Worth every penny."
1,Old Pleo is a $199 Dud,"We bought the $199 Pleo for our 7 year old daughter for Christmas. What a huge mistake and disappointment. After her initially being charmed by his babyish charm & good looks we were all extremely disappointed by the 5 min battery life and completely defunct programming. Even downloading the new software didn't improve his interactions and he simply stuttered on the same gurgling sounds over and over until his batter shut down which was about 3-5 mins with a full charge. Stroking him, the training leaf, nothing would cause him to do anything other than the stuttery gurgle.We all had super high hopes for Pleo and he was a huge let down. Thank God Amazon honors it's return policy, it is the reason I will buy from them without hesitation. Perhaps some day if we have more money than sense we'll try the new and improved Pleo for $300 but at this point it doesn't seem worth the hype for a toy that you can only interact with in hour long intervals at best."
4,fun...but not worth the price,"I got Pleo for my 14th birthday, and I have to admit it was pretty cool...then my mom told me how much it cost and I thought WOW! I mean it was neat and all but TOTALLY not worth the price! Also the paint on the teeth came off in the first ten minutes!"
4,PaPPy's Review,The battery doesnt hold a charge for more than 30 mins. And trying to get ahold of someone to return the battery is impossible. I think its dumb i have to buy a new battery and hope it works.
3,My son loves it but I don't get it,"The full price for this toy is outrageous! I got my son a used Pleo Ugobe. I didn't realize that it couldn't use the Pleo rb learning stones. I assumed (oops) that it would be able to upgrade to the software/firmware requirements of the rb, but nope. The Ugobe claims to be ""pet like, "" but I don't see that. It generally seems to be oblivious to its surroundings and seems to repeat the same sounds and motions regardless of what is going on around it. It does make noise if your pet its chin and will play tug-o-war, but really that is it. The battery life, as noted by many others, is very disappointing. My son loves this creature, but we spend a lot of time waiting for the battery to charge. That is disappointing. I will likely purchase another battery, but the $50 for the spare battery is too much. I am not sure what the manufacturer is thinking with the pricing of this toy."
2,Poore!,"The battery is very bad, quality of the color surface is also bad, overall it doesn't meet my expectations."
3,Our Pleo's,We purchased two Pleo's;so I am not sure which one I am reviewing. One that we purchased is great. The other all ready has a broken neck. The where a little slow to learn. I guess to be expected since they are newborn's. Either way thank you for the fast service. The delivery happened very timely and everything was as to be expected.
3,Fun toy. Crappy quality.,The Pleo is a really cool toy. But here we are just 2 weeks after owning and the paint is already rubbing off of the skin. Also the battery pack stopped working 1 week after we got it. UGOBE customer service BLOWS. They said the packs are on backorder but can't tell me when they will be available and told me to keep checking back. So we haven't been able to use the new toy for 2 weeks now. Nice idea... now if we can only get it working...
3,UGobe out of business?,"It seems perhaps UGobe has gone out of business. Their webserver has been down since Christmas, and we are unable to register our Pleo, visit the forums, or download new software.I have written emails, called customer service, waited for hours on both the phone and the web chat lines.They are gone... nobody home.The toy is fun enough for the kids, but they were excited to try some of the more advanced features with it. All of which require said registration. They have been waiting days now since getting Pleo as a gift for Christmas. Very anti-climactic now... and they are beginning to ""wander off.""Customer service has been less than useless, since they aren't answering any form of communication. Perhaps they are swamped, but they are certainly rude and/or inexperienced in handling affairs as a business should.Be aware if you are getting this, that you may not be able to use any of the advanced functions or software shown on the web unless you are already registered."
5,Wow,"I have to tell you that this product has continued to surprise me from day one.I got this as a gift for my significant other and it pleases on so many fronts. You do get to watch it 'evolve' over time from when it is first turned on to when it begins to explore and pick things up with its mouth. It cuddles, it plays tug of war, and you can tickle it (it laughs!!)That's all pretty cool. If you really want to get into it, you can program it as well. ugobe has some programs they've developed for Christmas and Valentines day that are pretty cool. If you like that, you can do some programming yourself too.All in all an amazing little toy!"
4,"Overall, God Fun","We bought the first version of Pleo 2 years ago. It has lasted well, providing hours of fun to the kids. It was especially good for parties, when everyone wanted to play with it and it was a good ice breaker for the kids. When only one child plays with Pleo, it becomes boring fast, due to its limited emotions.My only warning is the battery for the old model, the one still being sold here on Amazon. While the robot itself still appears OK after two years - the skin and the machinery inside all seem in good order - both of my batteries now last 5 minutes or less. It's as if the batteries can't discharge fully: the light on the charger turns from red to green in 10 minutes, and then the charge lasts 2-5 minutes.So overall - 4 stars."
3,Unsatisfied,This product seems to suffer from problems with the battery charger. The company is aware of this as it is widely discussed in various user forums. The company will exchange after returning the orignal and a two week wait. This is not very acceptable when the Pleo is given as a birthday present for a young child. Sending back the charger for a minimum of 2 weeks?? The company knows the problem so they should be more proactive.
2,Very cool when it worked.,"I bought our Pleo for xmas for my kids. My hope was that it would spark an interest in robotics and it was doing a great job until about a week after we bought it he went to sleep and never woke up. A million phone calls, several mailed parts, several purchases on my part to buy various testers or different card readers, and finally I got fed up and begged Pleo to let me mail him back where professionals could have a look at it and see what was wrong. It is June 5th as I write this, they called me last week to tell me he's fixed and they are mailing him back as soon as they get a new charger in stock (maybe all three that they sent me were bad). They honestly seem like they aren't a bad support crew, I feel like I probably fell through the cracks. I can't wait to get him back after months of not working so my kids can finally enjoy their xmas present. :) He seemed QUITE cool."
4,My son loves it!,"I bought this for my 5 year old for Christmas this year. I was going to buy him the other one that has been advertised called ""Spike"" that is a remote control dinosaur. However, all that one does is pick up a bone and roar. I am so glad I decided to get this one instead!! He loves how it interacts with him and he feels as if it is an actual live pet. Pleo eats and sleeps with my son and he never puts him down. It is very durable, but the only downside is that the battery doesn't seem to last all that long until it needs to be charged again. However, we are both glad that Pleo is part of our family."
1,"skin peels off, can't be repaired","I bought one of these a while ago and recently the skin started peeling off. I contacted the manufacturer and was told, ""Nothing can be done to repair the peeling skin."" Now it looks like a Dino-zombie.It was pretty neat while it lasted but Buyer Beware."
2,battery does not stay long,"It seemed like it was nothing more than a whole lot of honking an hooting - some clumsy movements - some improved movements - and some more honking an hooting. Him playing with his training leaf quite frequently (in fact, it's pretty much all he really does now) - but Pleo doesn't seem to care if he's playing with his leaf, or anything else at that matter In all honesty, it just seems very 'unaware' of it's surroundings, unless you're physically in contact with it. more. I think if you're sincerely interested in purchasing one, you should wait for a deal, because I don't think it's worth it's current selling price. Also battery only stay 30min. after that so many times freeze so we have to shut down many time. I contect UGOBE(pleo) he told me buy new battery because I got the old version that not working. even old or new it has to be work so I do not wanted spend more, I just return it back."
4,Vijay Kumar,"This is a very good attempt, for sure in future we will be seeing good advancements on this. It would have been nice, if it moved around a bit more then it does now. But apart from that no complaints."
2,No bang for the buck.,Its probably early days in the product cycle. We expected more diversity of experience. The user guide on the internet is not downloadable or printable.I am not recommending it to anyone yet.
2,Should have gotten a Wii ...,It's very pricey for what it does . Now if it could fetch a beer like the dog I saw in a commercial then maybe it might have been worth it . Was not amuse for what it does and they could have at least make it a little bigger . Takes long to charge and charge doesn't last very long . It's a very expensive toy that people have to shell out for their kids . I actually bought it for a nephew and I think I must have been high at the time I bought this through Amazon . All in all I should have gotten a Wii .

3,This is not Judith!,"This is Pharaoh's daughter finding Baby Moses! EEEEEEK!!!!And when we do find Judith, it would be Judith the ""Deliverer."""
4,Crucial Introspection,"the tracks on here are etheral and laid back, but have a sublime groove that are infectious. best when listened to very loudly so as to pick up the subtlies."
4,Four beautiful songs on an extra long EP,"Another brilliant Scott Hardkiss release and in a wonderfully packaged sleeve too! It somewhat sets the tone for the music.These tracks are all long, so it's well worth the price.Ranging from techno to tribal house, this is a must have. If you're not aware of Scott Hardkiss's music, when I say techno and tribal house I don't mean Jeff Mills style! This is soft and gentle and very well thought out music for the mind."
2,Track 1,"Don't waste your time with tracks 2-4... track 1 is the only good one on this CD. A nice new release at a great price, though."
1,A preposterous hoax,"Arachne Rising is a clever attempt to demonstrate that people could believe anything about everything. ""James Vogh"" is a pseudonymous used by famous american science fiction writer John Sladek, a total skeptic about anything else but hard science, who invented the ""Arachne"" fiction to discredit astrology, with the argument that people is prone to believe anything that is written or said with the proper tone and credits. It must be said that his attempt was rather succesful, although, applying his same scientific logic, it would be a total fallacy to used his experiment properly to discredit the basis of astrology. What he demonstrated is that people may be manipulated easily, but this manipulation is also daily applied by the media, by the governments and by the multinational corporations as well as by New Age and organized religion."
1,"Poor research, essentially a personal experience rehashed.","There was a famous competition in the UK once of misleading tips for foreign tourists. Try the echo in the Reading Room of the British Museum, double yellow lines by the side of the road mean double parking allowed etc. This books perpetrates another, which if you followed it would cause intense irritation. The statement that British shops (repeated more than once) are closed all weekend. Simply rubbish. You can food shop anywhere all day Saturday, and on part of Sunday, in all but the smallest villages, and even some of them. Its recommendation on maps is poor. I could go on with other inaccuracies. The book is not all bad, but a guide to cycling Europe? No way.A plea to all guide book writers - get your facts carefully checked by a well-informed native.A native"
5,Helpful,"Get instant feedback on where you are hitting the ball. Consistency is key and this can help you get there.It is a good training aid, especially for the range when you feel like something just isn't right. And for the price you can't go wrong."
4,Beautiful,"I really enjoy this dvd. Maya gives a sense of peace and I love the music. In other reviews, people commented about the plainness of the video. The reality is, you're supposed to do the exercises with your eyes closed, so you don't actually watch the dvd. You'll watch it the first few times to understand the poses, but after that you'll be LISTENING to it more than watching it. Knowing this, Maya concentrates on giving us good music and encouraging words instead of a visual show."
4,sat nam,i like it. very relaxing. the voice follow along is nicely done since your eyes ought to be closed most of the time. i kept my eyes open most of the first time and i liked that she had no distractions in her set and background and the music was nice.
1,too easy,"I bought the DVD and tried it once and felt nothing it was too easy and just not right for me. I have been practicing Kundalini yoga with Gurmukh and you just cannot compare. If you want to try Kundalini yoga buy the DVD with Gurmukh. It will change your life for better, improve your posture and breathing and your outlook in life"
4,Good Exercise - best for people with minimal kundalini experience,"I ordered this video from amazon prime and was very impressed with the price and process. I really enjoyed this video; it was good exercise, the music was fun and fit with the exercises without giving the ""jazzercise"" feel that some videos have. It was a little new-agey, but I liked that since it helpped with the relaxation process for me. The only complaint I have about this video is that there wasn't a huge amount of instruction on the poses and that might have been hard for someone with no experience with kundalini yoga. I took one class, 10 years ago and I was fine, but if you don't know how to do breath of fire, there isn't a description of that here. Once I've made more progress with this lesson, I'll definately purchase more her more advanced lessons."
2,Not what we were expecting,"My husband and I practice yoga a few nights a week to help with stress management. We were looking for something new, and this video received good reviews so we bought it. And we hated it. It was relaxing at first, but then we got to the point where we couldn't stop laughing. By the time we were supposed to chant ""har,"" we were done. I would not recommend this if you are looking for just basic yoga moves. It is a different sort of practice that is not right for everyone."
3,Single for thin people,"Although it is a good product and I was contented with the initialresults, the rubber is overcome quickly and the 10 motors nail in yourback and all your body. Now I am looking for somebody that me reforcethe rubber to be able to continue using it. For somebody either thinone it goes to him veryattention: I am not fat, I am of heavy contexture"
5,Great Product,"Best broadhead sharpener I have ever used, hands down.Works well on all broadheads, not just the G 5 montec....buy it, you will not regret it."
1,Once Twice ....NEVER AGAIN,First set i replaced with Bosch lasted a short time (I did not keep track) i bought a second set when the first went bad and then i did keep track .....2 years 3 months 7485 miles . my controller is working fine ! now i am shopping again FOR GLOW PLUGS MADE BY ANYONE ELSE !
2,Only 3 good songs.(in my opinion),"I am a BIG Switchblade Symphony fan, and I was constantly hearing about their version of ""Lucky Star"", but I was a bit disapointed by it. The good points to this CD to me seem to be: ""Erotica""(Razed In Black) ""Skin""(I'm not sure who redid this one, I don't have the artist listing with me) and ""Like a Prayer""(Biggod 20? ;o) ) If there is any reason to buy this cd, I would definately say it would be for the version of ""Like a Prayer""; I couldn't get this version out of my head for days. I can't even listen to the version of ""Cherish"" anymore, or I'll pee my pants laughing. As immature as it sounds, I can't help myself."
2,False Prophets,"Even a Madonna loyalist would flinch at most of these sad remixes. Testimony to the phrase ""Don't fix what ain't broke.""One would think that having a variety of Madonna songs sung by male vocalists would be an interesting change of pace. Well the pace has certainly changed but is interesting for all the wrong reasons.Most will have never heard of the selected bands offering these tributes and for good reason. It is unfortunate to have heard of them at all; far worse to hear them butcher these songs.Do yourself a big favor and just listen to Madonna get it right all over again on your old CDs."
1,>>>Ugh<<<<,"The album, and its predecessor are simply awfull. The only reason why this gets one star is BiGod20's 'Like A Prayer'."
1,Is this CD a JOKE or What ?,"Please avoid this CD, if you want a tribute to Madonna, go buy her Immaculate Collection and/or her upcoming GHV2. This CD (as well as Virgin Voices 1), contains the worst Madonna covers around."
5,Easy to use,"A nice and easy to use product for cleaningyour CDs and DVDs. I would recommend it.Be sure to use a soft lint free cloth, not paper towels."
1,Didn't work for me,"I bought this memory to use with my EPOX 8KD3I motherboard with an AMD 64 3400 processor. I could not get it to run at 200 mhz in the bios (which is actually 400mhz) when more than one module was installed. I even updated the bios, went through the motherboard manual which stated that the other module needed to be single sided when using two memory modules. So I returned one the modules and purchased a single sided memory module by Crutial Technologies (103482) 184-pin DIMM DDR400 DDR PC3200 512mb at Amazon. It still would only register at 166mhz regardless of what order the modules were installed in. Then I bought a Kingston Value Ram double sided 512 MB KVR400/512R 184-pin DIMM DDR400 DDR PC3200 and used it with the single sided module by Crutial Technologies. Bam! It ran at 200 mhz."
2,Freshman 15,I started using this product religiously along with my daily exercise routine. I figured it would help me fight off the freshman 15 now that I've started college. This product does not hold off any sort of hunger. If anything I snack more than I used to. I've even gained five pounds since I started taking this.The only reason I gave this two stars is because it has a good amounts of Vitamin B12 and that wards off mosquitos.
4,Appetite-suppression feature really works!,"I tend to snack when I get bored or read (and I read a lot). However, this product has exceeded my expectations by noticeably curbing my tendency to do so (I've lost a clothing size already after three weeks of usage without changing any other behavior), and this appetite-suppressing property lasts for hours on one tablet. Which is weird, because this product is mostly caffeine (but not so much that it makes my sensitive stomach upset at all) and B vitamins. It has more than that in it, obviously, because those two ingredients alone are things I was ingesting every day anyway. I would say, buy a bottle and see what you think!"
2,Worked for one day,"I am very open-minded and decided to give this product a chance - despite the reviews. I paid $22 for it and considered taking it back at first. The first day it worked all right but the second pill later in the day gave me a pressure headache. My appetite was suppresed mildly for the first two days but nothing the following days, in fact I felt hungrier, weird. I tried. Now I am trying NV."
1,Waste of time,"I thought this DVD was a waste of time. The filming is very poorly done. It looks like it is the work of an amateur. There are a lot of instances where you are watching the floor (i.e. the hardwood floor of the Hostel Gat Xino) or a drink bottle (Maxalot). The background music is annoying, not to mention the countless menus that you need to navigate through.I was very excited to watch this DVD since I will be spending some time in Barcelona soon. I have heard quite a lot about the beauty of the city. Unfortunately, this DVD only showed some back streets, supposedly 'hip' stores and very little of the landmarks. It succeeded in bringing down my enthusiasm.I will need to find another DVD that will do justice to the city."
1,great memorabilia,first of all.heavy metal fans stop and take a look to this awesome t-shirt from the album [generation swine 1997]. i'm a crue fan since 1984 and this t-shirt is a must have for any crue fan . great design great picture and great online shop [old glory ]highly recommended.to the new generation is time to start now to add to your collection. motley crue the worlds greatest rock n' roll band of all time.
3,Just OK,"Book was printed upside-down and backward. However the company corrected the problem promptly by sending a replacement copy,when we reported the problem. Customer service was good, but the problem was a big inconvenience. Company should inspect their books before they ship them."
5,Great shoes,Great shoes... light yet comfortable. Joan & David shoes.. true to size. Heels are just right and the fit is perfect. Dress from day to evening with no pain or uneasiness. Highly recommend.
1,Marketing scam,"I bought 2 bottles of this worthless supplement not realizing it is in the form of magnesium oxide. Manufacturers use this form of magnesium because it's extremely cheap. Unfortunately, it's not well absorbed by the body due to the size of the molecule. The only good use of magnesium oxide is in laxitives. I recommend getting a form that absorbs into your bloodstream such as magnesium glycinate, magnesium orotate, or magnesium malate. Magnesium oxide should be illegal in supplements meant to supply your daily RDA. Twinlabs makes some good products, and even makes some good magnesium supplements, but I will never buy their brand again due to their marketing scam with magnesium oxide. I have a health threatening magnesium deficiency and have been unknowing attempting to correct it using a product that is little better than a placebo. Companies that sell this product are risking people's health, and it's highly unethical not to say so on the label."
3,tolerable level of magnesium,"I beleive that this (400 mg)is quite a safe amount to take. In North America, most of us are deficient in this mineral. Research studies have shown (women) taking over 2,500 mg/day without any untoward effects. Magnesium will cause diarrhea if taken in too large a quantity and more than the individual can tolerate, so it is important to begin with small quantities and work up to larger doses. It's never a good idea to start at the top (dosage)."
2,Too much of a good thing,"I recently purchased this supplement only to later find out that the ""Tolerable Upper Intake Limit for supplemental magnesium"" is set at 350 mg. These caps give you 400 mg in one capsule. I know the upper linits are set lower so that everyone is safe so some people may be able to tolerate more. Getting an extra 50 mg every day probably isn't a good idea."
3,Three Stars,"I give this book only three stars because the title & cover illustration give you high expectations about what is going to be inside the book and once you open the book you might find yourself disappointed. This book does contain some optical illusion quilts but most of the examples are not particularly remarkable or interesting. They are for the most part, the same type of quilt blocks that you can find in your typical, generic book of quilt blocks.This book does have some good points, though. It has many fine and detailed illustrations about how to make a quilt. It would be a great guide for a beginning quilter. However, if you are an experienced peruser of quilt books and/or maker of quilts you will probably not find this book to be terribly exciting."
3,Quilting Illusions,"I should have taken heed of Kelley's review. Like her, I was extremely disappointed with this book. The beautiful quilt on the cover is by Jane Hardy Miller, and the equally exciting quilt on the back is by Judy Mathieson. The '40 eye-fooler quilts' created by the author of the book failed to either fool my eye or excite my creative juices. I found nothing in the book that I have not seen a dozen times before.The only fooling on this purchase was a fool being parted from her money, and that was not an illusion."
4,This is a really thoughtful book...,"Esera's book reads very well. I really appreciate that he shares his life with us, he did not have to. I have met the man at Univ. of Hawaii, he does have a beautiful voice.. and a year later finally read the book. I read this book and Reichen Lehmkuhl's ""Here's What We'll Say"" at the same time. Each book has it's positive and negatives but this book is much better flowing, seems more genuine, and Esera has such a big heart. It really pains me to see all that he went through to make some money in the game of football. I related much to his story and it really helped me. I live here in Hawaii and I know how disjointed the community is here due to culture and social stigmas. I wish he would have talked more about his relationship, living with a stylist has it's own stories to tell! Hmmm, maybe I will write a book Esera?"
5,Alone in the Trenches: A Must Read,"Alone in the Trenches is a powerful story about Esera's struggles to be true to himself while also conforming to societal expectations for NFL players.I can relate to Esera's experiences on a personal level, as I'm sure many will be able to, but what really pushes this book over the top is the blatant honesty and courage of Esera in publishing this material. By sharing his soul, Esera truly becomes a role model for all people.The book is well-written and a very enjoyable read. Once I began, I could hardly put the book down. The praises of Alone in the Trenches cannot be sung enough. Everyone needs to read this book."
4,Inspiring,"Esera Tuaolo has written an inspiring account of his coming out process as a gay man. Within the formidably macho environs of the NFL he concealed his sexuality for years, at great pains to his own psyche and emotional well-being.He then(with great courage and dignity)acknowledged to the world that he is a man proud of himself, his family and his sexuality. A complete human being at last.Good on you Esera. I am sure that many gay people will take heart from your fine example and live their lives as themselves, not what they think society wants them to be."
5,Fun for the cats and us,Great toy. Durable and the cats have lots of fun with it and we have lots of fun watching the interplay.
3,Scared of size,"My kitty didn't like it in the ball so she played with it outside the ball.Impossible to change the battery so it's useless now, not run byConventional batteries."
4,Good mini camera bag,"This is a good mini camera bag for compact camera and a spare battery / memory card. Fits my S400 perfectly, front pouch carries the my batteries and spare memory card. If you need to carry more, you will need to find something bigger. The con about this bag is it might scrach your camera with the zipper when you place the camera into the bag, otherwise the bag is perfect"
3,spring clip version out there !?,"I anticipate this is a quality item as it is LowePro: Seen in stores for slightly more $$ - does anyone know if this is available in a version with a strong spring clip for clipping to a waistband like a cell phone holster does? Do any slim camera cases have the ""spring clip"" attachment that I am looking for (I dont wear belts)"
4,Bill Laswell Does it Again (and again and again),"This is a beautiful CD to dream to...as are most CD's that Bill Laswell has had anything to do with. I feel very lucky that a friend turned me on to Mr. Laswell's Material project with ""Hallucination Engine"" (another fabulous record), because Bill Laswell has a little something out there for everyone, and it's always done well. Remember the awesome bassline from Public Image Ltd.'s ""Rise""? Bill Laswell. Looking for ambient? Bill Laswell. Jazz? Bill Laswell. Celtic? Bill Laswell. Rap/hip-hop? Bill Laswell. Always done with class and style. But, being partial to Eastern styled music, I rank City of Light as one of his best."
2,Did not last a year,"The monitor features and usability was great, but I was disappointed with how long it lasted. After about 1 year of use, an average of twice a week, the display went out on the watch. I changed the battery but this did not fix the problem. I used it mostly for spinning class and did not expose to harsh conditions. I expected a lot longer life from this product."
4,"Great workout companion, chest strap fits small frames","Chest strap fits my small frame (bra size 32/34) and heart monitor works great. I wasn't sure how cumbersome a monitor on my chest would feel, but I'm usually not even aware of the thing as soon as I start exercising. Features are easy to set up, though if I were into doing heavy data analysis on my workouts I might want more capabilities. The watch itself does run big--part of it is molded--but it's a tiny annoyance, and anyway, I put the watch on the bike/exercise machine half the time. (if this is for smaller wrists, I'd hate to see the other watches.)a few months after I started using it, for some reason the watch time became several hours off. Dunno if this will happen regularly, but since I use it in the gym, it's not a big deal."
2,Not for smaller wrists as advertised!,"I purchased this monitor for my wife specifically because of its claim to be for smaller wrists. Unfortunately, this watch was far too big for her wrists. Additionaly, because of it's design, it is only appropriate for one size. On a normal watch, the flexible band is attached on either side of the face. On this watch there is an extra half inch of immobile plastic that curves out and down from the edge of the watch face, suppossedly following the curves of a woman's wrist. Judging by the contours, the designers must have modeled the size of this watch on a woman larger than your average NFL lineman! If you're looking for a heart rate monitor to fit small wrists, pass this one by."
2,the hungry thing goes to a restaurant,"My older children had the original ""Hungry Thing"" book and loved it, so when my daughter came along I wanted her to enjoy the book as well. I ordered all three of the hungry thing books, and must say that of the three I was the most disappointed with this one. The illustrations were from a different artist and I felt were not as nice as the original drawings. The story line while not terrible was not very original. The whole overall feel of the book seem to be lacking something that made the original story such a fun, and different story book. My daughter likes the story fine, but I was not thrilled with it at all."
4,Short But Sweet,My Grandkids love it and I'll bet yours will too. It's so clever they won't have any trouble getting their parents to read it to them...the whole family seems to enjoy it.
4,Gorgeous Snails,"What unique characters Lionni chooses! My boys loved the pastel colored illustrations of the snails and their ""houses."" We also get to see an example of oral tradition: the title fable is really a story within a story. When one little snail expresses his wish to build a really big house, an older snail tells him the story about the consequences of having such an enormity for a house. Later, much older, the little snail is asked why his house is so small, and he answers by telling the tale. Not terribly exciting, but enjoyable; and the illustrations are, as usual, gorgeous, especially that amazing and huge snail house."
3,Not perfect,The hat is very well crafted. Biggest drawback is the hat received is not white and green but more of a bamboo color and green.
3,Only Ok,"Well the hat in the picture looks epic. Im sure thats the one the majority of the buyers got, but unfortunatly i recieved a different one. The one i was sent was durable and sewed together well, but it was much to thin and made of different fabric that was tighter than the one shown. The biggest problem i had with the one i recieved was that the green stripes of the brim and center of the hat did not match up throwing off the pattern and the authenticness of the hat."
3,"Good, but...","Overall this hat is pretty good. I'm a huge fan of the show, and I needed a new hat so naturally I'd want Urahara's. The sad thing, though, is that the hat shown in the picture is not the one that I got. True, the one I got has green and white stripes instead of green and kahki, but the stripes are off! There are three parts of the hat that were sewn together. The top, the middle, and the rim. It seems like each of those parts were slightly twisted when they were sewing it so that none of them matched up. Overall I think I got what I payed for, but I also see me in the near future making one that more fits Urahara's."
5,Urahara-kun's hat? Oh yes..,"Kisuke Urahara = the sexy-est store keeper that ever lived.When my friend bought this hat I was so f-cking jealous, I almost stole it.(oh bad me! >:D)Anyhow, I tried this on and I felt like I just had sex with him.(No joke o.o;)I loved this hat ever so much.. but alas my friend moved away.(Well actrually ..I moved)I highly recommend this hat for those who love the sexy store keeper. Hopefully you will feel like you just had sex with him too.^_-"
5,Yay! :D,"I bought this for a friend. The order came in time, and he wore it everywhere. I think he said it was a bit small, though. Maybe make the hats more ""one size fits all?"" I'm overall very satisfied."
2,An okay gift...,"I just received this hat in the mail. It's made of sturdy material and was stitched well, but the lines on the hat aren't where they should be. Kind of defeats its purpose..."
3,Not for those with bigger heads.,"Would be nicer if they made em any bigger or a stretch liner, but they don't. good for kids. For people who need reference I'm Wearing a size 7 3/4 Boonie hat right now and this thing doesn't even come close to fitting. I'm guessing about its about a 5 1/2."
2,I bought it as a gift.,Personally i dont like it. I think is silly. But my bf loves it. He wears this hat almost every single day. Hes a fan. I wish this would be a bit bigger but i think its fine. Id buy from this seller again.
1,"if you have a big head, this isnt the hat for you","well, its nice and sturdy but it doesnt fit. It seems like a miniature of what Urahara was really wearing. Would look great on a kid but on an adult it looks pretty retarded. :["
5,Amazing,"The shipping from Circle Red took a little while (about a week) but this thing is amazing. It's of much higher quality than I'm used to seeing and it'll fit just about anyone. Highly recommended for fans of Urahara Kisuke the Shinigami, enjoy ^_^"
5,Excellent and elegent,I recommend this book to all my fellow DCs and manipulative practioners. The techniques are elegently presented and the dvd is most helpful. The rationale presented for applying the manipulations is very good.The video fluroscopy clarfies what to consider in the setup and manipulation. I would like the authors to also have included how the make a diagnosis leading to which segment they would like to treat and which technique can be used but perhaps diagnostic skills are already asumed or that is another book and there is also Greenman's Principles of Manual Medicine which covers dx.[the 4th edition is excellent]
1,Flawed Design and too big,"I generally wear size 10-10.5 so I purchased x-large size, which is for foot sizes 9.5-10.5. First off the splint was too big so my foot was flopping around. The problem though was not actually the large size, it is the placement of the middle strap. The middle strap should be placed at an angle so your foot doesn't just slide up. I had to use a separate bandage wrap to strap my foot in properly. The splint is nice and soft, but the inner plastic shell would put pressure on my ankle. I avoided purchasing a cheaper splint because I didn't want to waste any time and was desperate. What a mistake! I purchased a cheaper BIRD & CRONIN splint for about 2/5ths the cost and am quite satisfied. The only nice thing I have to say about the Swede-o splint is that the outside is covered in fabric as appose to just hard plastic your will find on other splints, which is nice because it doesn't scratch your other foot."
4,Great but...,"I love this item - only caveat is another reviewer mentioned it runs large and I didn't listen. It's way to big for my foot. I should've gone for the smaller one, but instead I tried to play it safe and go with the sizing provided in the description. Still, it works GREAT. Helps alleviate the pain right away!"
1,"not comfortable, and doesn't put the foot into 90 degree angle","I bought the smallest size and yet it is very loose inside and that makes the foot go into the relaxed position anyway. So, I don't think it will work. I see no relief yet. Also, the valcro part is bigger then the strep below it so it rubs on the skin and hurts, I had to cut it and make it more narrow.Since I cut it, now I can't return it, so for me, I think it was a waste of money. I do not recommend it to anyone. Hard to sleep with it too."
2,Too Floppy,"I bought this night splint last year for chronic heel pain. I was hoping it would help stretch my lower calf muscle, which was very tight. While the splint was comfortable, it did not hold my foot at a ninety degree angle. The splint has no strap near the ankle so my heel kept sliding up. I wore the device for four or five months but it did nothing for the heel pain. This is the second splint I've tried. The first was the sock-type thing that yanked on my big toe. I don't recommend that one either."
3,Not so Swede-O,"have a pretty good case of plantar fasciitis so decided I would give some night splints a try by recommendation of my doc. Saw these, and thought they looked the most comftorable. They have relieved the morning heal soreness, but the velcro hurts, and I can't get them tight enough to keep my heal in place to really work. I wish I would have went with the blue hard plastic ones because they are adjustable, and stretch the calf/foot better. They are also more comftorable on the inside. Overall, I think there are better night splints out there than this."
3,Good quality,"This splint is of good quality and is fairly comfortable. The challenge is that doesn't really keep the best position for me. I do agree with some other reviewers that noted that the sizes run a bit large. I had intended on buying the size the company noted, but I did go down a size. In fact, I could have gone down two sizes. My foot does turn and slip in the boot. I solved this by adding a bit of padding. While I think this split is more comfortable than others, it doesn't really keep a good stretch for me. I have also tried the ""toe-pullers"" without success. My new plan is to use this splint, incorporate exercises and wear my custom orthotics. I believe a combination is the best solution."
2,ok...not good or great...go with something better quality instead,"The velcro is wider than the strap it attaches to, snags and scratches every time I wear it. Typically comes loose throughout the night. Doesn't really fit tight enough to hold foot in place. Center strap is oddly placed doesn't really hold foot in. I do notice some mild relief after wearing it but I think a better fitting, more elevating splint would do a better job. Too bad at this price! Not worth the money."
2,"Doesn't help much, but comfortable","The last night splint I had was really painful, caused a neuroma between my toes, and I would always rip it off in the middle of the night because my feet fell asleep. So I bought this Swede-O based on reviews and tried it out.First, it's very comfortable, unlike my other one. I could wear it all night with no discomfort. However, it's too loose in the foot area. You can tighten the straps around the calf but not the foot. My foot was swimming in there. Consequently, it didn't hold me firmly enough and in the morning I have the same pain I do without a night splint.So comfort is one thing ... but if it has no effect on my plantar fasciitis pain what good is it really?Like other reviewers I bought a smaller size than their sizing chart would recommend and it fits just fine."
1,Dont waste your money,Buy the cheapest one. This thing is so unconfortable and big. I am size 13 and the boot comes size 18. Do not buy this thing....
1,Simply did not work,"Simply did not deliver as promised. I went to the conference, and I found the theology to be unbiblical, useless and with no results. As usual, author blamed everything on lack of my faith etc...Advise: Seek God personally, there are no quick fixes. Anyone who promises you that is offering snake oil. Wallen was right about one thing, Jesus is the final authority and a relationship with the Holy Spirit is of vital importance. The rest is just his views and takes on the origins of soul and demons; which I found to be flawed, contradicting and non biblical.Before I went to the conference I had a good review posted up here, but after having seen for myself, I cannot agree with it anymore."
2,Good but not good enough,"The Stories taken from the ""Tales of Terror and Mystery""tion are good but the others are quite horrible. Also the version I have has 1 story missing ""The Confession"" and a fantastic tale from ""T&M"" is not part of this collection. Production values average. Buy that collection instead. A much better deal."
4,The master in horror's fine horror fiction revealed,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is most famous for his Sherlock Holmes investigative short stories; but in fact he also was a master of the form in horror fiction, as THE BEST HORROR STORIES OF ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE proves. From supernatural settings to psychology horror and mysteries, a great diversity of theme, approach and subject is demonstrated in short stories which excel in high drama and intrigue."
4,A good collection,"While not particularly scary, but definitely horrific at times, this collection is surely worthwhile. The settings and character types tend to all be quite similar, usually a young doctor on an ocean-going journey or medical students at a university and the writing style is virtually the same as well; however similar all these traits are, they're absolutely good ones to retheme, as it were. This is a good book to have on hand while going about your own journey, be it air, sea, or highway."
4,Perfect If You Can Only Use One Hand,"In 1991 I lost the use of my right arm; I would be helpless in the kitchen without the Swedish cutting board. However, I have a complaint. After a few years, the clamp wears out (or breaks). I haven't found a place to buy replacement parts, so I wind up buying a brand new cutting board, which gets expensive."
5,Really fun Yahtzee game.,"13yo girl & 10yo boy enjoys this game, even more fun with mom. ha!ha! Very fast paced and exicting. Game does 'slow down' after a round or two if it's not allowed enough time for player to match cards. Forgot to mention, this and my other reviewed items were purchased for Christmas 2007."
2,not fun for 20 somethings,"i bought this for my 25 year old brother based on the great reviews. we have a blast playing taboo, cranium, whonu, scrabble, and of course any card games. however, this game was reaaaaly boring for us. rolling dice over and over trying to match the colors on the cards was just frustrating and dull.we played this game for 10 minutes and will probably never play it again. garage sale!"
5,Love Mortimer,"Our families favorite story. I give it as gifts to all new babies, along with others that our family has loved!"
5,Great Christmas Book!,"Very cute Christmas Book about a little mouse who moves into a manger, moving everyone else out. Later, as he hears the family tell the Chrismas Story he realizes that the babe in the comfy manger is Jesus and moves them all back in. He gets his own reward for his kindness in the end.It's a very cute book. The characters, drawn by the same illustrator as the ""Bear Snores On"" books are sweet and the story itself has a good message. My two girls love ""Mortimer"" and we read it almost non-stop after we received it. Being Christian, I especially appreciated that the author was willing to use the name Jesus and to keep it tied to the true meaning of the season."
5,A Blessed Christmas Story,Mortimer's Christmas is a wonderful story about giving unselfishly and the birth of Jesus and it is told in a way even the younger children can enjoy. I read this during a Preschool Story Time at our library and several parents and grandparents asked where they could get copies. The illustations were great and the story moved along quickly. Karma Wilson has found a way to share the true meaning Christmas with the little ones.
4,1/2 price,"Most of the really significant tracks are on the two disk ""Hip Hop Gold"" for less than 1/2 the price."
3,"Starts out strong, but falls short ...","CD's 1 and 2 are on point from rap's pioneers, but the box set falls short on CD 3 and 4. Don't get me wrong, some of the artists on CD 3 and 4 are great, but their respective tracks certainly aren't their best work.You want the best box set ?Buy the Def Jam 10th Year Anniversary box from 1995.Ten years later ... it still blows this box set away."
1,Hammer?,Just remove Hammer -- and put in Vanilla Ice instead. LL cool J? Hes a punk. Mr. T pities that fool.
1,This is NOT a Black Sabbath CD.,"In case anyone was wondering, this is NOT a Black Sabbath (the famous metal band)album. That's why I give it one star. Don't be confused by the search results."
2,not very good,"badly written, not very informative. Little to no explanation of the figures. Quoting of papers out of context makes for a confusing read."
1,Ok what was that?,I have been to Myrtle Beach many times over the last 31 years but I bought this to show friends that have never been there.60min please try 18 minutes. Those 18 minutes are not all that informative mostly a big commercial for golf courses is all this is.My advice save your money this just isn't worth it
3,Good first effort,"I was introduced to this novel by the author herself. I understand it is her first, and it is a good initial effort. While a little rough around the edges, it is at the same time simple and unpretentious. It has the nice warm feel of family lore. One can just imagine Ms. McCall's grandmother telling her this story in bits and pieces over long winter nights in the mountains.One can only hope that, in the near future, Eva McCall can get a larger publishing firm to give her work the attention it deserves."
1,Very disappointing,My 4 and 6 year olds were so excited when they received these walkie talkies. One of the set did not work so they could not play with them at all. Would not recommend them to anyone
2,Walkie Talkie Headset,My son really wanted this for his fourth birthday. The problem we had with this was the sizing. My four year old has a average size head and the headset will not fit comfortably for use. It has an sliding range to make it a bit bigger and still doesn't fit right. It does just fit my one and half year ond.
2,"some interesting points, generally difficult to read","Perhaps the book is too specialized for me as amateur history-enthusiast (although i found this book via a recommended reading for 1st year history students). I found this book tedious and often did not have much of an idea what point the author was trying to make here. I liked his discussion of the role of women and monasteries as institutionalized memory of medieval society.I am curious to see what others found of this book. I, for one, will not read this book again."
5,A chicken with heart,"A gentle, and very human, tale of a chicken who loses its ""family"" and gains a special place in the hearts of a new family. A chicken, a cat, and a little girl make a new life together. This one doesn't ""talk down"" to children as so many kid's books do. Upbeat. Cute. Fun. Has the feel of a ""classic""."
5,A Gentle Tale For Children,"In a era where our children are often bombarded with violence and scary stories at a very young age, The Chicken Without A Coop offers a gentle yet adventurous tale for kids 4 to 8 years of age. Columbus the cat helps his new friend, Henritta Hen, find a cozy home. A chicken using a cat-door? Humorous and touching...I recommend it!"
4,Buy the Import!,"If you want to buy this cd (and it is well worth getting) please make sureyou get the import either here or thruAmazon UK. It has nine extra songs and you'll be missing a large part of the charm of a fine album if you settle for the US version. My two favoriteson the whole album, Hound Dog & I Want You, I Need You, I Love You, are among the missing tracks. And although these are Elvis classics I honestly think I'd rather hear Billy Swan's versions.Swan slows down and relaxes both (although Hound Dog still has a nicebuzz in his voice) that in a bizarreway makes each song more mature and adult than Elvis's famous versions.And since Elvis was a James Dean fanSwan's I Used To Be James Dean fitsright in perfectly. This album is offbeat and fun. If you liked Swan'sI Can Help voice and were an Elvisfan, get this album. It's actuallyseems kinda inspired. It's not just product. Swan's a throwback in a good way. People seldom try like thisanymore. Worth having."
5,very good he does it like elvis should of done it go Billy,he sings it like elvis should of done the songs i love the way Billy does the songs
2,Plot deserves 5 stars but I had a problem with the pictures,"Brian, a young boy, is diagnosed with diabetes and hospitalized. While in the hospital, he learns about his diabetes and begins to practice giving himself shots. He feels lonely and overwhelmed. His mother has the bright idea of giving him a stuffed teddy bear who also has diabetes. Brian is able to practice his shots on the bear. The bear is a source of comfort because he has to experience the shots just like Brian.I liked the story, but I really could have done without the subtle product placements all through the illustrations. I could live with discrete print advertizements in the parents' sections. I do not think that the text or the illustrations in children's books should be used to hawk specific products."
3,Just OK,This movie was just OK for me. I love Michelle Williams but I just did not like the movie. I watched it about 10 days ago and now can't even remember what it was about.
2,Trivial content makes for an incomplete reference,"This book really isn't bad; it just seems so incomplete.It really does a good job of describing the changes to game that Planes of Power provides. All the level 60 plus spells are listed along with the high level disciplines. And the map section is useful, being limited to ""lowbie"" areas outside the major cities; occasionally handy to have all in one place. There is a decent description of many of the ""new"" planes, with a listing of monsters.It is not, however, a complete, ""latest and greatest"" reference to the Everquest game. In my opinion, an up-to-date, complete reference is sorely needed."
2,Not up to parr,While this book is very informative with learning the trade skills and the elements required to help your skills. I was very disappointed that it was not like the other strategy guides in that it had all the spells for the classes in it including all the new ones. It only listed the higher level spells and my old book is outdated. It would have been nice to have all the books combined into 1.
2,The Dodgers Encyclopedia Not What I Had Hoped For,"I purchased this Dodgers encyclopedia in the hopes of learning more about the team's rich and colorful history. While this book does contain a lot of history and facts about the Dodger organization it is not very well organized. Had the writer better organized and presented in a chronological manner along with more detailed team rosters and more on the great rivalries such as the Giants, the Big Red Machine/Little Red Wagon (Reds) and last but not least the love em' or hate em' Yankees, I would have given this book a much higher rating. Sadly I was hoping for more..."
5,A GREAT AND INSPIRING STORY,This story was extremely vivid and detailed. It is very well written and was inspired. It told of both the good and the bad of his challenging adventure
3,Good initiative... bad judgment,"This book was pivotal in inspiring me to become a backpacker and mountaineer; I hadn't remembered much of the story - it was my summer read at 4-H camp in the 70s! After reacquiring the book, I was sad to discover how much of it is a primer on how NOT to go hiking in the winter! Technological advances have made Mr. Ryback's clothing and gear choices charmingly antiquated, but his dangerous lack of preparation and forethought in many situations overshadow what the book strives to say about his personal experience in nature."
5,Hits all the points dead-on,"I've read this book cover to cover. If you are expecting some ""tome of knowledge"" that is going to impress people but collect dust, this book is not for you. This is going to be a well worn desk-reference for managers, architects, and software engineers.The book's nineteen chapters cover all the practical elements of assurance that should be expected out of commercial software. Not only has the author covered the issues of what the software has to do, but also has covered the human aspect of fielding the software and the very human aspect of system and application administrators that have to deal with the software in a changing environment. It is obvious that the author has been in each situation that the book describes. Oh yes, and to prove that there are three case studies that show the assurance process in action.This is a must-get book if you are leading a team, work in a corporate environment, or are about to launch you public facing application."
3,Alphabet soup with no practical guidance,The contents of the book shows an interesting structure but it does'nt help much in the end as it turns out that the author digs into vague concepts without any practical guidance on how-to implement them. It sounded like this book is about reading a proprietary architecture of an application server and its relaibility characterstics. The author comfortably escaped from narrating the details of design for solving real life problems...because the devil is in the design details and it is MISSING in this book. Unfortunately this book won't get you hands-on anywhere except for catching few jargons from the alphabet soup.
1,"bad belt, don't buy it",it sucked! the plastic burned thru and i could smell the burning and the foam inside was burning as well
1,Save your money,"I thought it might work. But the black plastic pipes that come with this do not hold it up. It must be tied up to a fence to even stand up and even then it is completely racked. The pipes that come with this are far too flimsy to do anything at all let alone hold up a net. The only redeeming feature is the net does bounce the balls back to the shooter. But save your money just buy a 6x6 net, then go to Home Depot, buy PVC pipe and build your own."
1,Don't buy this goal. You'll be disappointed.,"This goal is absolutely terrible. If I could give it zero stars, I would. I bought it for my son a few weeks ago, and it kept falling over, even with the anchors firmly secured in the ground. When w managed to get it to stand for a short amount of time, it did not stay straight--kept racking and twisting even with screws in place. Now, after only a few weeks, the main post in the back completely folded/broke and it is lying flat in my yard. Waste of money."
2,hummmmmm,its realy weird it says 6x6 but iits like 5 1/2x5 1/2 it dosent evvn stand up i through the ball in to the top corner and it fliped over then i put somebig rockks on it and now its ok and net is hard to get on but makes the ball bounce back.
1,the WORST AP Bio out there,"this is by far the worst AP bio test prep out there. it leaves so much out. also, the author assumes that anyone using the book is only shooting for a 3 and thus she leaves out most of the indepth questions necessary to get a 5. my advice: get the Cliff's AP bio test prep. i read that book in 2 days and got a 5 without ever taking an AP bio class."
1,A dissapointed reader,"THIS BOOK ABSOLUTELY SUCKS. IF YOU WANT A GOOD SCORE ON THE AP TEST, HERE'S SOME ADVICE: DON'T USE THIS BOOK! LIKE MOST PRINCETON REVIEW PREP BOOKS, IT OVERSIMPLIFIES. IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, BUT COME THE AP TEST, WHOAAAAAAA! TRUST ME. DON'T BUY IT."
5,Great Shirt,This is the perfect shirt for a new father of twins. I am giving it to my son-in-law for his birthday. They found out they are having twins and he is so proud. If you know a proud father of twins he will love this. Only wish I could have gotten it in grey for his size.
1,unecessary review,"The cable is fine.The emails and this review are unecessary and a nuisance.please take me of any further mailing lists.If I have a problem I'll let you know.I personally feel advertising in America is intrusive and much too aggressive.Help me when I ask for it, then leave me alone.see ya,Oren"
4,Fits the Nikon D-40 like a glove,"Got a D-40, need a travel bag and don't want to spend a fortune? Then buy this. Easy huh?"
5,Perfect Size - Great Price,I needed something to put my miscellaneous items in for storage on my taller shelves in the office and the kitchen. They make your space look less cluttered and they are easy to reach when you need them. A perfect size for me. Can be put anywhere. Very durable.The only con is that the label stickers are very difficult to remove unless you have a sharp tool (knife) and some olive oil. It took me almost an hour to remove them. It cleaned up OK without any damage.
1,...,It doesn't really work well. Because it's velcro it tends to come apart under the seat when trying to adjust it...
1,Can do without!,I purchased this item for my child to use on a 7 hour road trip. Completely useless! I used an ice cooler as a foot rest.
4,Great Foot Rest,"This works great to keep my daughters legs from simply dangling over the edge of the car seat. Also gives her somewhere other than the back of the passenger seat to put her feet! Simple to use also, just slide under the seat and the childs weight keeps the mat in place. ""adjustable"" in so far as you decide how much goes under the seat. Worth $20."
2,painful acting,"I will not take away from this movie some good things it has going for it: nice black & white film, decent but not fancy camera work, great music (if you like good noisy indie rock).What is so-so: plot is minimal and action is slow. I actually like this kind of movie when it is pulled off well, as it lets you linger on the atmospheres and the characters. If you don't like slow paced films, you'll really hate this.What is bad: the awful, awful, awful acting. Horrible. At one point I thought the guy was intentionally overacting, doing something in character. But he wasn't. Some of the actors are worse then others, but all of the main characters are painfully, distractingly bad.The acting pretty much sinks the movie. I'd really only recommend it if you are big fan of the type of music involved."
3,Another view,"If you live here (as I do) you willl be surprised at how careless the locals are about preserving the beauty of their land. If it weren't for the National Parks, most of these mountains would have been sold off to developers long ago. Also, the locals have no qualms about polluting the air every spring and fall when they burn brush or trashing the roadsides with litter. And as far as I have observed, very few of them drive hybrids. So, maybe some outside influences are n't such a bad thing?"
1,Where's the music?,Absolutely do not buy this particular video. I bought the Baby Songs and Playtime both by WeSign. Those are just wonderful. Babies & Toddlers are instructional videos for adult. There are no follow along songs so you could watch it with your child.
3,"Almost, but not quite there....","....I remember seeing these guys (and girl) in a previous life in Omaha, Nebraska. This CD is mostly fine, but doesn't capture the energy of their mid-80's shows. Since it appears that these shows were mostly one-off gigs, I suppose they were recorded and released (in limited quantity, it seems) for the sake of nostalgia. But ""nostalgia"" is a kind word for dead, and these versions are, unfortunately, sometimes less-than-inspired. It's good to hear these tunes once again, but they're best heard in their original (i.e. studio) contexts. Elektra seems to be in no hurry to re-issue their music on disc, so logic tells me that SOMEBODY can pick up the re-issue rights for a song, so to speak."
5,If you are a graduate student in computational chemistry and you need a little more help ...,then this is the book for you. Check it out first from your school's library and you will see that it is really well written.Now I wish they would make a book for second quantization.
4,Beautiful Photos,"I bought this book because I saw it for sale when I was in Hawaii, but didn't want to carry it home with me and risk the chance of it getting banged up in transit. The photos are beautiful. The only thing I don't like about this book is that some of the photos run from one page to the next, which means that there's a big crease down the center of some of the really great photos. It's a great coffee table book, especially for those of us who live far from the ocean and need a reminder of its beauty."
4,The Wave Energy Comes Right Off the Pages,"You can actually feel the energy of the waves in some of these shots coming right off the pages. There are some very awesome shots - unusual angles, colors, and just plain spectacular.Great coffee table book. That's where mine stays, and I still pick it up and flip through it when I'm on the phone.Mother Nature makes a great model to work with."
4,Good enough to make me want more,"A Twist of the Knife was my first read of a book by this author, and I liked it enough to come looking for more by him. I am the first to review it. I noticed I hesitate to buy books that are less than five stars, so I was tempted to give this one five stars. Bottom line, I enjoyed it enough to want more. The one-line review on the cover that caught my eye said ""A sizzler...Wambaugh and Caunitz better look out."" Wambaugh is a favorite, and so I gave this book a try and I was satistied and will read some more."
2,Problem reading dvd's,"Having trouble reading dvd's with this product. No instructions, no troubleshooting guide. Keeps saying it can't read dvd, problem with country code. The dvd is US and the unit seems to be unable to recognize it. Not so happy with this product right now."
3,Works great sometimes,This worked great for the last 5 months and then I went to use it and it decided it wasn't going to work. Tried again 30 minutes later and it worked again. This would be great if it worked all the time but apparently it doesn't.
2,Please: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT or buy at your own risk,"I purchased this in 2009 for my Samsung Netbook thinking it was light and portable and rugged enough for my needs. I didn't realize until recently how much I had paid for it. I am actually a bit surprised. I must have gotten over it very quickly or never looked into getting it replaced or sending it back. I bought this for about $85 2 years ago. Unfortunately it did not last very long as you can see and failed to work after very little time (several months or a year maybe). Though it looks nicely made, actually appears to be very cheap and flimsy. You may have a different experience than I. The price has come down quiiite a bit, but still -- buyer beware. Better off getting something more expensive but better quality. Thanks"
2,Doesn't do half of what it's supposed to...,"It did not read CDs and when I tried to play DVD's a message popped up saying that the DVD was ""not intended for use in my region."" It only played my Sims 2 game which is DVD-rom game. Also, it was kind of noisy. Needless to say, I returned the item."
2,External drive,This unit looks good but came with no instructions and no ability to troubleshoot. There was always an error message stating: unknown device and unit requires an external power supply to function properly.
4,"read as biography, not a style book","nice biographical reading, but not enough in recent project infomation. a little disappointed that Andree didn't say much in book."
1,Worst time travel book I have ever read!,I can't believe there are any good reviews for this book. I wish I could get back the hours I spent reading it. I just know that someone is laughing about the money I spent buying it. I would have given it a zero if I could.
2,Too Expensive,"The whole reason I've held off buying this is because I thought it was overpriced. So today I get a notice in my cart that instead of the price going down it's gone up a few bucks. The book is several years old, no paperback or Kindle version. And publishers wonder why business is hurting."
2,Newlywed Game DVD Version,"The game is great for a party, but NOT in the DVD version. It plays too slowly and ruins the momentum of the party. I would not buy the DVD version but try the standard game instead."
2,Not very fun,"I bought this to play at my annual couples Valentine's Day party. The first year we played it as it came & we all hated it. Very dorky video & the questions were not good or funny. So, the next year, I followed the format of the game & made up my own questions & it was a riot. We laughed so hard we cried & some of the couples got into little ""tiffs"" over each other's answers just like the couples on the actual show. If you already have an idea of how to play the Newlywed game, don't waste your money."
2,Fun as you want to make it,"The theory of this game is fun, but it really is based on the 1960's game. The people in the video are from that era and the culture of the questions as well. It was fun because we all got silly about the questions, but an updated version would be awesome."
4,Good 4 Couples,"I am a game show junky, and when I saw this game I just knew I had to have it. Me and my husband and a couple of our best friends (couples) got 2gether and played this game and had a ball. I think that overall endless did a great job with portraying the actual game show, the questions were fun, and it left you wanting to know exactly what your mate said. I would recommend this game to all who love to play game show games. I give it 2 thumbs up. Try it 4 the price you will not be disappointed."
2,newlywed game,"This game is a lot of fun, but you can only play it 5 times before the questions start over. That part of it sucks! It's a really fun game, but we were really disappointed that we couldnt play it more."
2,wouldnt buy,game is fun but it kept messing up in the dvd player. questions are old i knew that but there about famous people back then which i am 22 and love the show but the game had alot more people questions in it then in the show
3,A bit confused in direction,"It seems for the latest Recoil installment that the music has taken a backseat and this album is more a showcase for vocals. I must admit, while the album has its moments, I fail to see the supposed theme. A pilot, who is killed in a plane crash, sees his life flash before him in the contents of the music, which is bookended by an intro and outro. However, his life is apparently filled with stories of twisted seductresses, murderers and the wife of Ahab, Jezebel. I fail to see the connection. If you like soft and hard textured voices, spoken word and urban trash stories than this is for you. If you like more of an electronic, sophisticated, layered sound, go with the '97 album ""Unsound Methods"". It is worthy to mention that ""Liquid"" has great artwork and a very consistent image, physically. As for the music..."
4,Liquid through your ears,"Man, i'm a big Depeche Mode, NIN, Nitzer Ebb and Recoil fan, and i must say this is NOT an ordinary album, it is a beautiful piece of artwork. It's like a mixture of painting, poetry, music, and it's kinda moving. Wilder does a great job by joining forces with some of the most accurate people in the art circle. I dare you to listen to this album at night in bed, and remember to use the correct phones. This is something that you can't let pass you by. And i'ts got a lot of stuff in the interactive part of it. BUY IT DAMMIT !"
2,Disappointing,"Well, I have to say, I was very disappointed with this album. Alan Wilder is a great talent...but it doesn't shine though on this record. The production is amazing (can we expect anything less from Alan?) but that's it unfortunately. His choice of contributors on this record (with the exception of Diamanda Galas, Monti and Dean Garcia)leaves much to be desired. No song structures, horrible shock rock lyrics that leave you feeling not disturbed....but empty, untouched, shallow. Musically the only song that jumps out at you is the single ""Strange Hours"". If your new to Recoil....don't make this your first listen....get Unsound Methods or Bloodline...this is where Recoil shines."
1,terrible,"Alan Wilder's previous releases have been excellent so I was really looking forward to this one. It's terrible. Boring, absurd narratives in every track talking over a sometimes-interesting but usually-mundane music background. A terrible cd that I wouldn't have even considered without his name on it. Next time I'll listen before I buy, he really failed on this one."
4,Loved Parts but Found it Uneven,"I bought this because I'm a big fan of Nicole Blackman and she is on this album. I was pleasantly surprise to be listening to more than just Nicole's voice, unfortunely I didn't find this true for all tracks. Unfortunely, there is probably not enough demand in the market for each one of these artist to have their own album, therefore, I'm more than grateful for this complilation of these artist. I just don't think the execution of which artist followed which artist, and the totality of craft of all artist on the album was pulled off well."
5,NIN FAN GOES MELLOW?,"I attended the NIN fragility V2.0 tour in Cleveland, Columbus, and Indianapolis. This music was used before the opening band, and between them and Trent. This music is totally sensual and addicting..tracks 2,3, & 4 are phenominal..the rest at first seem odd and dark but will have you humming along in no time....GREAT ALBUM....good relaxing mix of music."
3,"Killer tracks, too much yacks","*I heard only the promo mp3s that the fans were posting, about 40+ seconds each.As always the mix is deep and original. The gospel and catalan vocals were good but the feminazi-anger-urban vibe and other ramblings obscured the sound"
2,A big let-down,"As a fan I couldn't wait to get my greasy little fingers on the new release from the talented Mr Wilder. Well,what a disappointment. He seems besotted with narrative(which is highly effective and evocative in small doses)which rages and groans across virtually every track on what could have been a superb album,with its eerie backdrops of creepy samples and various other suitable noises. The previous release was more accessible,especially the vocals.This one is rather overpowering,and the only tracks that succeed are 'Want"", 'Vertigen' and 'Black box part 2'. Alan Wilder should ditch the awful rappers and concentrate more on his creative keyboards."
5,Excellent Working Material,I use the concepts in this book every day at work. The CD that comes with the book is easy to download and it has many new tests to enter and create clear graphs of test scores. I attach the graphs to the end of my reports and then use them to explain results to families. I actually bought two copies and recommended the book to all of my coworkers.
2,Essentials of Cross Battery 2nd Edition w/CD-Rom,"The main reason for this purchase was to use the forms on the CD-Rom. I had our technology specialist load this on my computer at school, but he was unable to because it has a virus on it. He opened the package and it had not been used yet. I did contact and request a new CD on 4-4-08. The book is woderful, but the CD is what I really need to access the forms."
5,This book is our daughter's favorite book!,"We have dozens of books, but our two year old daughter consistently brings out Lost Cat. She can complete every sentence and often takes over the paragraphs. It is a fun book, and keeps the parent's and children's attention each time."
5,This is a wonderful book!,"This is absolutely my favorite of my daughter's 4 million books. People tend to fall into two camps (love 'em/ hate 'em) when it comes to cats, and the phrase ""only a mother could love him"" indicates the same is sometimes also true of loved ones. This book, using those dynamics, introduces kids to personal perspectives: He's a wonderful cat who sits on laps/ he's a horrible cat who jumps in my lap. It's all done in a delightfully goofy/endearing way."
2,El Guajiro,"The video on this DVD is excellent, there is only one problem, no audio! I tried playing this DVD on my home DVD player, on my computer using Windows Media Player, Roxio Media Player, Real Player and Nero but still no audio....evidently Pimiento Records in Miami still doesn't know how how to make DVDs that work."
2,Very basic,"If you have never turned a computer on before this is a product for you. But if you have worked with Windows for a while you won't find it useful. It has no advanced features on it. It tells you how to cut, paste and save documents in different programs. It is a waste fo money for anybody who has worked with windows before. It doesn't even teach you what you need to know to pass a computer test at a temp agency!!"
4,African threads in Diasporan artforms,"Thompson's work on African retentions in New World artforms is seminal in the field of African Diasporan art history. However, Flash of the Spirit reads more like a best seller than a textbook. Fascinating details and insights into the meanings of art from Haiti to Georgia to Brazil, with excellent context for all objects. Great for anyone at all curious about African heritage, religion, and art. Occasionally thick reading, as one must trace entire cosmologies, but well layed out, full of illustrations, and textually easy to follow. Thompson makes an obscure genre easily accesible to readers of varied backgrounds."
1,Useless rechargeable battery,"I am very disappointed with the performance of this radio. I rarely write reviews, but would like to warn everyone about Midland products. After only a few month, the battery is dead. It costs you more to buy the battery than the radio. The range of the radio is also not up to my expectation. It performs equally or worse than a Motorola I had which has only a 2-mile range claim.Go with Motorola, much better quality."
4,A terrific memory,"As I write this, the Amazon sales rank for this album is 94,718! I hope that my single order moves it up ... atleast half way.""Oh Pleansant Hope"" is a terrific memory of a great friend who brought this home from Viet Nam. The cuts are terrific. This album is NOT the overly loud Blue Cheer, rather it is a bit more relaxed. GREAT STUFF! Relax & enjoy the Cheer's finest. It's a ""gotta have"" for any collector"
3,Ok,"I use this book in school and we have found some of the answers to be incorrect. They teach somethings very well and others they don't explain it very well at all! Its good to work with, but I would not be completely dependant on it."
4,From a Ski Movie,"To be honest, I originally only bought ""Things You Should Leave Alone"" because I heard two of the songs, ""things you should leave alone"" and ""big day"" in two ski movies, both produced by Match Stick Productions. I was anticipating a luke warm c.d with two or three really good songs worthy of listening to over and over again. I was really wrong, and pleasantly disappointed. The songs are high tech, and the vocals are really dreamy and hypnotic. The whole album is very seductive. From a skier, it is something you can ski to. It is something, with the volume up, you can run to, you can paint to, you can do anything to it. I normally don't like that kind of music, but Puracane is very good, and quirky. Their cover of Jane's Addiction ""Summer Rolls"" is really good. All in all, the cd is good. There are a few songs that need to be skipped over, because they are too hypnotizing. The rest are breathe taking, landscapes of music engineering and eerie vocals."
4,heard them & seen them live,"My only complaint about this band is that they don't perform and produce enough. I was shocked when I heard them play, by the caliber of the music and their high-energy and engaging delivery. If you enjoy deep, oldschool rock like Zeppelin or Free, as well as modern electronic, you'll dig their sounds. And besides great music, it's a great looking band."
4,Nice cd,"First time I heard it I thought it was similar to Olive and their sound, but darker. Didn't sound like Portishead, not like Morcheeba, or Hoover. I think this cd isn't one of those things you should leave alone..."
4,First Solo Release,"After listening to Marvin Glover's first solo release ""ONE"" I am very impressed. He has assembled a terrific mix of musicians to create ""ONE"". My favorite track from ""ONE"" is ""Upside Down"". This particular track reminds me of the 80's super group ""The Outfield"".Great work Marvin!!! I look forward to your next project"
5,The sex never stops!,"Incest, sexual bondage, group sex, bottom sex, everything. Why don't sex therapists recommend these kind of books, or do they? Anyone who doesn't get turned on by this book ... well, they'd better give up."
5,Absolutely Fantastic!!!,"If you haven't heard this album, you realy realy have to.They're amazing.Their voices, lyrics, melodies, how they sing a song, their performances,... . they're called The Kings Of Pop of persian music. you'll surely agree with me if you just know more about them..."
1,video editor should be fired for this..,"the simply red performance is very good but after 5 minutes of camera angle changes every 2 seconds,i gave up.don't waste your money........"
3,simply red Italy,"Concert was great, but I was unprepared for the amount of Italian language being used. I had previously seen a edited version of this concert on DIRECTV and the Italian was mostly edited out."
5,"""Love Simply Red""","I have always loved this group and first purchased one of their albums back in the early 80's. Mick Hucknall's voice has nicely matured and sounds better today then compared to earlier years. I first watched this concert on channel 101 at least eight times or more, I lost count. I was so glad to see the concert on DVD and available on Amazon. The DVD shows the entire concert. They could not have picked a more perfect venue for concert ""total class."" I would love to see this group live in concert and wish they would tour the United States.TerrySanta Fe, New Mexico"
5,"Simply Red, Home Live In Sicily is fabulous","Well, its better late than never. Just view the DVD Of Simply Red, Home Live In Sicily. I agree with Goldie comments. I love this music. At last, one can understand the words of a song. Most songs today, you can't understand what they are saying. Mick Hucknall sings perfect. Best concert I've seen in a long time. And Simply Red band is a group of the best and talented you will ever hear. All band members are the best. GREAT MUSIC. Dee, Sarah, Chris, Dave, Ian, John, Kenui, Kevin and Pete; what a band! Love a band with the numerous instruments. Flute, Saxophone, trombone, trumpet makes a great band. And this band has it all.Don't forget the keyboards, percussion, guitar, bass guitar and let us not forget the drums. Pete can sure play those drums! FABULOUSI highly recommend this DVD. EXCEPTIONAL"
4,Mick is a soul brother,"This is an excellent concert dvd. Sound is DTS quality and filming is wide-screen and first rate. The concert starts a little slow, and song selection could have been a little better. His versions of Positively 4th Street and You Make Me Feel Brand New are outstanding. In my view, his best songs are the more uptempo soul songs. Something Got Me Started here is a perfect example of this. If there were more songs like this, it would be a 5+ star concert. Still, he puts on a great show and sings up a storm. I'm sure Simply Red fans will love it."
1,MISSING,"I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR 5 WEEKS FOR MY ORDER, NEVER ARRIVED IN AUSTRALIA,PLEASE HELP ME.THANK YOU."
3,Good Audio...but lousy 5.1 Surround Sound mix,"This is a great show, great and interesting DVD..beautiful setting for the concert. The audio is good but expect only sound from the front and center speakers. You won't hear much from the surround speakers at all (not even the audience' applause at the end of each song...). I don't know who did the surround sound mixing but it is pretty bad if you compare it to other DVD concerts with DTS 5.1 surround options (check Peter Gabriels DVDs, Elton John's recent Box Set and even Rolling Stones latest DVD set) and you will see what I am talking about.Don't get me wrong...the sound is acceptable but don't expect a fully 5.1 surround mix nor in Dolby Digital nor in DTS."
4,Interesting Book,Good for old French recipes. I enjoyed flipping through the pages and seeing what the recipes consisted of. It made me very hungry!
4,Great for offices too!,"At my company, everybody has an office, so we needed a quick, inexpensive way to communicate with each other. Our phones are not capable of handling intercoms, so we needed another option. This product works great for us. Setup was quick and easy, now when we want somebody to stop by, it's a quick push of a button. The reception could stand to be a little better, but for our purposes, it's just fine. I'm about to order four more for the rest of our offices.P.S. I received a quote for installing a full wired intercom system that was over $3,000. So at this price, this intercom system is a bargain."
2,Extremely poor voice quality,"I bought a set of 4 of these wireless intercoms from [...]. They more or less work as advertised with one glaring exception: The voice quality is not just bad, it is absolutely dreadful. Worst than el cheapo analog units from decades ago. Happily, all I want to do with them is hear my wife say ""lunch is ready"" and other very brief messages; a lengthy conversation is out of the question. I might also mention that at this level of quality, the price is outrageous. I posted a review to this effect at [...] and, to their credit, they DID post it."
2,Very poor voice quality!!!,"I agree with the other reviewer . . . as far as setting them up, mounting them, etc., it was easy BUT the voice quality is horrible!!! I quite honestly cannot understand my 10 year old son when he asks the simplest questions such as, ""How do I sound?"" It sounds like the teacher on the Peanuts shows. Very disappointed!!"
3,good but not a potent as I would have expected,"For our cat we use approx a double dose just to relax her. It's good for when company is coming over (she's anxious). We have yet to be able to clip her claws even with the pet calm, oh well. I'm not giving her more than a double dose and I don't think I should have to. It's a good product for light relaxing of your anxious pet but not much more."
2,Questionable........,"I bought Richard's Organics Pet Calm for our Yorkie to calm her down when we travel. My husband and I are long haul truck drivers and at first our youngest Yorkie was okay traveling over the road. However, when we travel over rough roads (and there are a lot of rough roads out there) she starts to pant and shake. She will take Richard's Organics Pet Calm readily enough (it has a sweet taste to it) and does get that ""sleepy eyed"" look, but I didn't see enough of a calming reaction to justify buying it again. However, I haven't tried it under ""normal"" stress circumstances, such as at home during a thunderstorm. I think that for milder stress situations, that Richard's Organics Pet Calm might work."
3,maybe calm,"Dependable efficient service from Amazon merchant... maybe it's just a chronic personality thing... am waiting for the 'calm'! Of course, it's just between two - everyone else gets along! They are both the same age... perhaps it's 'sibling rivalry'!"
2,"Sodium Benzoate as a preservative in Pet Calm is a ""no-no"" and should be eliminated to reduce cancer risk to pets as in humans.",Product is great idea if the sodium benzoate could be eliminated and a safer substance like citric acid used instead. The risk of sodium benzoate serving as a perfect substrate for cancer to develop and grow is an unacceptable risk for pets and humans alike!
5,what an inspiration,"Here is an excellent voice and speech improvement programm. It really works; I can benefit from it forever. Of all the courses I have studied, this is definitively the best one."
3,"Great content but obsolete format - on the whole, good value","I found this very helpful to understand the mistakes I make in pronouncing English - it's too early to tell whether my English actually improved, but I believe it will. I particularly appreciated the fact that the course does not require users to read the book while listening to the CD and can therefore be used on the move.Why only 3 stars? Because the old tape format hasn't been adapted to the CD format. The sections are spread over multiple CDs or interrupted in the middle of a CD in a very confusing fashion. You also hear instructions like ""Please flip the tape now"".On the whole, it's good value for money, though."
2,"please, do it on CD","We need this kind of stuff on CD and easy to use, for example: like American Accent Training. with track number in each CD we can do each exercise, again and again."
2,I'll Wait for CDs,"The makers of this product need to ""modernize"" it and make it available on CDs. Till then, I'll just wait."
3,"Unpolished, but Full of Potential","This a book that frustrates me deeply to try to review. With an absolutely fascinating plot line that is skillfully developed, it is a story with almost limitless potential. Yet the writing itself is disappointing - more like a first draft than a polished work. This is a book that deserves to be revisited and rewritten when the author has gained a bit more depth and maturity as a writer. It has too much potential to be allowed to die. There is too much richness. All the potential is here for one of the truly great books of this generation - but it is an unmined treasure in its present form.This is one book I want in my personal library if its full richness is ever developed."
5,Good read,"If you have seen the TV series and were upset at being left hanging after 2 short seasons on Lifetime, you should definitely read the books to get all the answers."
4,A great read if you can suspend disbelief.,"It's a vampire book that doesn't take itself too seriously, but isn't a farce. This entire series has very fun characters. The good guys have non-trivial flaws, which I heartily approve of.One thing I don't like about this book is the fact that the science makes no sense at all. It's easier to suspend disbelief for straight up magic than bad science. Also,the PhD program in the story operates in a way that I find odd and unlikely. Where are these students' dissertation committees? Who is funding their work? This is why I'm not giving the book five stars. When I read this at 16, I didn't notice any of these problems, though. It was when I re-read it after a couple years of grad school that I noticed. Like... aaaahhh! Do you have any idea what havoc embalming fluid would wreak on the delicate vascular endothelium, Ms. Huff? Bad bad bad havoc. Excuse me, I need to go find my smelling salts now.But basically, the whole series rocks."
2,Not the best of the series,"It's interesting to compare Tanya Huff and Laurell Hamilton--Hamilton's Anita Blake series has a shaky start but picks up steam as she begins to develop her characters. Huff's Vicky Nelson series, on the other hand, seems to become more strained as it goes. For me the best one of the series was #2, Blood Trail, which has a wonderful portrait of ""werewolf culture."" Blood Pact is much more mechanical, and the character of Vicky seems to be particularly abrasive here, even given the fact that she's grieving for her mother (explain to me why this woman is so fascinating that she has not one but two lovers waiting on her every whim). The shock ending has an air of desperation, as if Huff's trying to give the book a kind of last minute punch. I wouldn't start reading Huff with this one. Start with Blood Price (the first) and see how you like the characters."
4,Surprise Ending,"Just finished this book. I liked the first three, and this fourth one, I liked as well... but maybe not as much. In Blood Trail and Blood Lines, I thought the mystery was a little too simple and too easily solved, although I did enjoy them. This book was definitely not a simple and easy read. The whole story was complicated, and the continuing triangle with Vicki, Henry and Mike added even more complications. The ending was definitely a surprise. I didn't see it coming at all, and for some reason I'm disappointed in what happened. Partly because I wanted to see the whole love triangle resolved in another way, but more so because it just changes too much. But I am looking forward to the fifth and final book of the series to see what happens next."
3,"Great Plot, Poor Writing","I read Summon the Keeper by Tanya Huff and I must say it was a very good plot but again the writing was jumpy. This book had one of the most creative and well-developed plots I've ever read and I have just a month ago past the 400th book I've read since I was 11 and able to read adult books (13 now). Yet the writing in this story jumped around a lot and the "" F-word"" was used all too frequently. I'm not sheltered from life by any means and I've heard more "" language "" then perhaps the average person but every other page is just too much.I still besides all that highly recommend this story for the activity and plot alone. It would also be a very good movie."
3,Maybe she should have stopped at three.....,"I read the first three and really thought they were great. Reading one right after the other because I enjoyed the characters so much I didn't want to let go of them. But in the fourth book, I felt something was lacking and I really did not like what happened at the end. I'm going to hold off reading the fifth book for awhile. Let the disappointment pass before I try reading it. The first three books are very good, so please don't pass on them. But pick up the 4th at a book exchange instead of spending full price on it."
4,Bad eyesight can be cured!,"This is another fun book from Tanya Huff. I have wondered when Victoria Nelson's degenerative eye disease would be cured. I am waiting to read the last book of the series because then it will be over. I have loved all of the books in this series and eagerly await more. Yes I also read Laurell Hamilton, but somehow Vicki seems more real to me.......if having vampires for friends can be real."
3,He's Filthy!!,"Yes he is quite Filthy. If you read the synopsis on the sleeve for this DVD it must have been written by someone who hadn't seen the movie. Watch the movie first then read the synopsis. I liked this movie, it's pretty funny which makes up for its low budget. The local landowner tries to kill Filthy Guy because they believe a prophecy saying he will be the next emperor. The land owner wants the emperorship for himself so he must kill his own servant Filthy Guy who is about a durable as Curly from the Three Stooges. In the end the action come up as he frees a political prisoner, becomes famous, rebels join him and two hot babes fight along side him. If you like Sammo's comedy then this is one to get."
3,"silly, silly, silly","Sammo Hung in his 'funny' mode. Unfortunately, even he is not able to save this dog from dying."
3,The performances and recordings disappoint,"This inexpensive two CD set presents four wonderful Dvorak quintets and one sextet. I own the original Philips LP performances of the piano quintet and a late string quintet. The string players did not attain those idiomatic Czech cross rhythms and phrasing required for my fullest listening pleasure. The fine piano performance of Stephen Kovacevich (he was known as Stephen Bishop on the LP) was closer to this ideal. Unfortunately, serious sonic flaws of the LP persist on the CD. The upper register of the violins remains thin and unpleasant, and the balance between the strings and piano levels in the opus 81 quintet is not good. The piano sound is far too dominant. My suggestion is to look elsewhere for recordings that better capture these beauties of Dvorak."
3,It aint Lunasicc Its Luni Coleone!?!,"I'll make this hella short,his ""new style&flow pattern gets on my nerves because track after track it sound the same,prodution lacks too,although I'm feelin Tay's beats....man I got sick of this cd after like 2 days.Nuff said!"
2,Cans were damaged.,"Ever get that feeling your purchasing something that need, but that when you get the package, you know you got screwed? Well, that's how I felt when the shipment arrived. The case was damaged and it looked as if we had bought a damaged case for full price. Not a good feeling."
2,"Yep, this stuff is pretty nasty.",I ended up adding half tea spoon of salt with every meal because it was just soooooooo bad in taste without any salt. I wouldn't buy this again and would rather go for the regular stuff.
1,Inedible,"Both my wife and I are fans of Campbell's regular Cream of Mushroom.However, ... THIS IS ATROCIOUS!! ... almost NAUSEATING!!"
3,Harness for GM,This product did not save me much time. It was difficult to find space for the extra bulk of wires. It was nice that I didn't have to cut into the factory harness but that is about it.
1,I was sent the wrong T-Harness.......,I was sent the wrong T-Harness. Either I ordered the wrong one or was sent the wrong by mistake. Exchanged it for the correct one.
5,70 Signs Of Depression,I looked for the information contained in this book everywhere. It's been a great help in dealing with my loved one's bipolar. Don't know why C Johnson would make such a comment. But the book says not to share it with someone who has bipolar as he/she won't like it.
5,Best Book in this genre,The proven co-management techniques and honest insights into dealing with someone with bipolar are great. And so is customer service. I highly recommend this book.
1,70 Signs of Depression,What a ripoff! There are approximately 130 pages of text followed by a quiz and charts. The text consists of common sense thinking that most of us already possess. This is definitely not worth the $60 price tag (includes shipping). Save your money for more worthwhile books.
4,The New Knighthood: History of the Templars,A very detailed account of the Knights Templar. Difficult to follow if you are NOT familar with the names of some of the cities.
3,"Detailed, but so dreary!","One reviewer calls this book ""readable."" Yes, it's in English! Sadly, I took ""readable"" to mean that it provided some sort of entertainment value. Absolutely wrong! This book is a pure text book, scholerly & detailed, certainly, but also dull & dreary. Suitable, perhaps, for a medievil history major in need of masses of names & dates. All that information is certainly there, together with an enormous amount of those annoying numbered references attached to, what seemed to be, every 25th word in the body of the text. My recommendation is, that if you're looking for an account of the Templars that can truly be described as ""readable,"" then you should be looking elsewhere."
3,"Although the message is postive, this book lacks facts.","Don't get me wrong, I've am vegan and spread the word, but this book is more propaganda than fact. If you are looking for scientific facts about how to be a maintain healthy while eating vegan, this might not be the best book. This is a good book that covers the uglies of saturated fats and cholesterol, and where our meats, diary, and eggs come from (which I think should be in a nutrition book). I bought it and don't reget it, but wasn't completely happy with it."
3,Traditional American hard rock,This 1970 year album is traditional american hard rock example. Musicians are good. Ernie Joseph is very good guitarist. But their music is simple and uninteresting. There is only one (IMHO) interesting tune (Wake Me Up In The Morning ) on this CD.The last track is pure drum solo.
1,Not the same rug as pictured,Love this rug BUT the rug I received isn't the same as pictured. It is a much darker green with a lot of black and a different border. They offered that I could return it...but I would pay shipping. Spectrumrugs say the item # is the same and I'm sure it is but the manufacturer/importer has obviously substituted a different rug but didn't change the picture. I have filed a claim with Amazon.
1,THIS CHANNEL NEEDS TO GO OFF AIR!,"This was one of the worst serial killer thrillers I have ever read. I found the entire novel incredibly boring, sluggish, and unsuspenseful. The main character, Lucas Frank, was poorly developed and Felix, the killer, did not seem like a good candidate for a serial killer. It was a good thing that this novel was short because, the book was not exciting and seemed to take a long time to get through, even though it was only 322 pages. I did not like the ending either. I felt John Philpin did not do a good job with the conclusion of this novel. There were so many flashbacks throughout the entire novel that it drove me crazy. I have read many good novels this year, but ""The Murder Channel"" was definitely not one of them. Be smart and save your money."
5,What a read!,"If you read this book and miss the message, read it again. The problem is yours. Lucas Frank doesn't want to deal with the horrible acts we commit on each other anymore. Felix Zrbny grew tired of them too. Dr. Frank has the skills to catch killers. Felix was only 14 years old! How do we cope with a world that is fed to us on TV? How do we live in a world where patriotism isn't service to country but being a good consumer? This book asks important questions and thank God gives some answers."
1,The Murder Channel,"Thsi has been the most difficult book to follow I have ever read, and believe me I've read many. The back and forth between the reporter, the psychologist and the criminal makes for need of a score card. Normally when I read a good book, I go and purchase all other books by the author, in this case I would be afraid. If his other writings are remotely like this one, I wish to steer clear."
1,Waste of my money,"**BUYER BEWARE** 5/11/11 This is an update to my original review. IF YOU DECIDE TO WRITE A TRUTHFUL REVIEW HOW HORRIBLE THIS BOOK IS, THE AUTHOR WILL WRITE NASTY THINGS ABOUT YOU WHICH TRULY SHOWS HOW MUCH THE AUTHOR CARES ABOUT HER IMAGE RATHER THAN THE ACTUAL BOOK CONTENT. WRITE A BETTER BOOK IF YOU DON'T LIKE CRITICISM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Original review:I purchased this book for class, not by choice. This book sucks!!!!!! I can't follow it AT ALL. The examples it gives in the chapters are not clear. For example, it doesnt tell you ""..we want mL/hr at the end"" i actualyl don't know what it wants!!!!!! Don't buy it. I've only opened this book twice, and I'm already trying to get rid of it."
1,"This is the old 1999 version, not recent 2005 version!","This listing is for the old 1999 version v.1 made in 1998.It only works on Windows 98 and ME, not XP and newer!The version 2.0 made in 2005 not only works with Windows XP but also has much more sheet music and loads faster and easier to use interface. It also contains biographical and analytical information that is not in v 1.0.Amazon has version 2.0 hereMozart: Complete Works For Piano (9x12) With CD"
4,not as good quality as earlier puzzles,"When my daughter was a baby, we bought her the jungle animals puzzle and loved, loved it. They were painted all the way around and so smooth. These, however, have the color on the front only and have rough, chipboard-like sides exposed. I was sad, I have to admit. But, it's still cute."
2,Should Be Extinct,"I was so excited to get this puzzle for my little ones. Unfortunately, the item description is misleading. The puzzle looks nice (before the kids get to it) and the chunky pieces were a perfect size! However, this puzzle is NOT hand painted. The puzzle pieces are just faced with a sticker, that easily comes off (in pieces!). That is not the quality I was expecting, especially from Melissa and Doug. I've had the puzzle for 2 months now, and 2 or 3 of the pieces have the stickers mostly peeled off."
4,Loved this Puzzle,my son is 22 months and love this puzzle along with the 12 other puzzle we have for him.. took a long time to ship.
5,Chunky Puzzle,"My 22 month old son loves this puzzle. The pieces are easy for him to pick up and he has learned to ""adjust"" each piece so it fits into its correct slot."
5,What can I say....IT'S GREAT!,"Being somewhat partial...(my brother is the drummer in this great band) I still must say that this album is super! I have listen to these guys since they started, and they just get better and better! I really really hope that their music will spread around the world. If you have the opportunity, you should really go and see them live! They rock!"
4,"Good album, but song titles are mixed up","Good, solid album. I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars.That said, Amazon has the song titles all mixed up for this record. I don't know if i had a bad download or what, but i had to listen through all the songs and match them up to the sound samples over on allmusic.com. I'll post the song titles and their track length to try and help others out in case anyone else has this issue.Can't Stand Myself - 3:43Every Step - 3:13Steal Time - 4:28Home - 3:30Game Over - 3:21Stay - 3:20I Will - 4:20Unforgettable - 4:47Final Echo - 3:38Keep Me Smiling - 3:25Walking Away - 3:24With Me - 4:16"
2,disappointed,Watch appears being tampered with already. Saw one fingerprint on the glass of the watch. Bottom of watch also saw a spot filled with dust in which an orginal sticker was supposed to be sitting at.....
4,Book of colorful pictures,"Book is full of beautiful colorful photographs, several collections are pictured. I like it very much. Bought this book used, excellent condition, great value. Only flaw, I thought there would be more of a individual discription of the Bakelite items, maker, age and value."
2,Too much jewelry not enough prices,"I bought this book to learn about Bakelite, to get an idea of prices and for bakelite other than jewelry. If you are looking for a book with a lot of pretty color pictures of jewelry, this book is for you. For my needs, there was only 4 pages that I found useful."
4,If you don't do this someone else will wish you had,"This carefully organized guide will lead you through the process of doing all the things many of us have had to do for someone else after they were dead. Life is complicated in the 21st Century. Death can be far more so. If you buy this book and follow the clear, concise instructions provided there you will save the people you care most about a lot of time. You'll also allow them to focus their grief on the loss you create in their lives, rather than on all the responsibilities you left undone while you were living."
2,Getting Silly,"This once charming series is starting to lose its steam.Molly has turned into nothing more than a nosy, annoying pain in the .... She sticks her nose into situations that have nothing to do with her, and doesn't seem to think the police can manage to do their jobs withour her ""tactful nudging"" in the right direction. The fact that Tommy allows her to keep intruding into his investigations is just getting silly already -- almost as silly as her constantly teaming up with Stephanie and taking her orders, when she can't stand this woman.It's time to put this series to bed before it turns to plain God-awful."
5,Virtuosity at its most virtuosic!,"This set of virtuoso solo piano playing contains my favorite recording of Liszt's Mephisto Waltz. Wild has created his own cadenza at the end. You just have to hear it. He also briefly does some improvisation in the Chopin Polonaise (in good taste), and it does not distract from the piece at all. It sounds completely unplanned yet falls perfectly in place with this music. I highly recommend this CD for anyone who enjoys Romantic Style piano playing in the GRAND STYLE! No pianists today can match this way of performing!"
3,It'll only show you the most severe off warping,"I wasn't expecting miracles from this straight edge, but if you are building race engines this tool is not enough to expose minor warping. On high compression motors (14:1 +) you'll want to take the head/block to a good machine shop."
3,Well made except very poor sound editing,"This is a fascinating part of history, but the documentary ""Failure is no and option"" could have been far better it the sound editing did not have the music so loud. The music completely overpowers the speech and makes it very difficult to listen to. I don't know why there is a trend to having the sound effects or music to be so much louder than the speech.It was good to learn of the professionalism and hard work of mission control. The moon missions were incredible achievements, and equally amazing that capability was abandoned. Now after 35 years NASA almost has to start from scratch, even then it will take them longer to develop a system than in the 1960s."
4,"Uneven collection but ""Failure"" worth the price alone","If this collection just contained ""Failure Is Not An Option,"" I would unhesitatingly give it five stars. Gene Kranz's personal retelling of the space race provides enthralling insight into what went on behind the scenes, what life was like in Mission Control, and how decisions were made.Unfortunately, the remaining items in the set aren't of the same caliber. ""Project Orion"" is decent coverage of a bizarre effort to use exploding atomic bombs to propel spacecraft. ""Space Shuttle"" is nothing special, and if you want to see a good documentary about ""Apollo 13"", get PBS's ""Apollo 13: To the Edge and Back"", not this one.That being said, ""Failure"" is worth the price of the set all by itself. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in how we got men to the Moon."
5,Informative study of Native American history,"I just finished a class on Native American history. The use of the text ""First Peoples: A Documentary Survey of American Indian History,"" by Calloway was very informative. I found that the book expressed the true history of the Native American people. As I read the different chapters, I found my self able to clearly picture the different events that took place. This is coming from a person who purposely saved my history requirement until my second to last class to graduate from college. I have never enjoyed history. This book really changed my views on history!"
5,"Amazing book, just the kind I was looking for.","I have been interested in European Indian relations for almost a year now, and I have read many books on the subject. This book is great in the way that if gives you,1. a chronicle of the Indians from before Columbus to present.2. For the most part a non bias account of the events that shaped European and Indian relations. It talks about what the Indians got out of working with the Europeans and motives for converting.3. A vast amount of illustrations, maps and primary documents about important events.Instead of looking for another book about Euro-Indian relations just get this one. It is a textbook but trust me it is a great source and answered all of the questions I had."
3,Not QUITE what I expected,"The book is a little worn, which I actually like, and expected, but it's not the edition that I had thought it was. I CAN still use it for my class though, so not a total loss."
5,Great travel toy!,"This maze was a great find for our summer vacation! My 2 year old son had a ton of fun moving the animals around, matching animals to their farm home, making animals sounds, etc. Extra plus - no pieces to lose!"
3,Good for travel,"I bought this puzzle/toy for a recent trip with my 3 year old and 10 month old. It's really cute, but not that much fun. I like that you can't lose the pieces, but my daughter got frustrated trying to get the animals back to where they should be and my 10 month old, just pulled on everything. So, yes, they are midly entertaining, but don't count on lots of play time with it. At least that's how it was for us. Still, I like the fact that you can't lose pieces and the artwork is very good and the quality is also good."
3,Neat design lacking quality,"Our toddler enjoys the appearance and movable pieces. She tries to pull the pieces off and eventually gets frustrated and loses interest.The puzzle would be more suitable for young children that understand the knobs don't come off! For toddlers it's okay but not something they'll enjoy without getting upset.As with other M&D; products I purchased, they ALL are sticker/paper and NOT painted on the wood. There was flaws and chipped/peeled off areas on the puzzle picture. Our toddler would peel the image off if not supervised!These products NEED to be made in U.S.A not China!"
2,Stickers peel off,"I got this 'puzzle' as a hand-me-down from my sister. A few of the animals have peeled off their blocks. Granted, I dont really know what the puzzle went through before it reached us, but I am still dissapointed in the quality. I dont think the animal images should be able to come off."
3,different that expected,"I was looking to purchase ""The Lastdays ofwwII"" that is shown on Netflix. This one has the same cover but is not the same. This one spends too much time on Nurenbueg trials and the gold and art works.I wish I could find the one I wanted. It's about 14 hours total."
5,Good history and a lot of little known facts; the extra features are a little disappointing.,"I had this on VHS recorded from the original TV broadcast; I was glad to get it on DVD and it was as good as I'd remembered it. The extra features were good, too, but not up to the standards of the main features and could have probably been edited a little better. Still, well worth the purchase."
1,L:ast days of a desperate producer,"With all the interesting lightly explored topics of World War II why waste time on might-have-beens of low probability? This was as bad a production as I have ever seen from the history channel. The title was misleading - I expected people cleaning their files, perhaps something on the ""Imperial Conspiracy"" or the impact of the end of the war on the colonial people, but not this trash."
1,Worst phone I had so far,"it's the worst cell phone I had to date.1 this phone has 1 to 2 second delay when buttons are pressed.2 because of slow button key I kept doing and unding key lock/unlock several times to actually call anyone.3. battery life is only about 48hrs (standby) and defintly not 200 some minutes as what this phone's spec says.4. phonebook is pretty messedup. phone book name displys only first half of first line, although it allows you to enter two lines.5. on/off button some times takes second try.6. it's not straight forward to save work/home/mobile... under one name.7. phone charger connection is so flimsy that in certain position it won't charge. design is pretty messed up.8. 1/8"" of color lcd screen is already dying only after 5 month of useage.9. signal is very poor. I'm sure this lot more to do with Tmobile.Basically slow and unintuitive phone.Bright side of all this is that Tmobile contact is only for one year."
1,Fragile - Handle with care,"Worked fine for one month and hence am giving 1 star to it. Dropped it once on floor. Since then the microphone stopped working intermittently. Contacted tmobile, they told that they sent another piece, and never got one.And tmobile: I moved from Texas to Boston. Most of the times its out of coverage. Even in busiest business areas, it hardly shows one line.So my suggestion: If you don't maintain a belt pouch for this phone, donot buy, coz once you drop it, you might end up 'NOT BEING HEARD', and if you are in Boston area, don't think about tmobile."
4,Good quality phone,"Pros,Bluetooth, AIM, camera, dual screen, keyboard, voice recorderCons,Software, menus, phone book, keys could be better,I found this phone to be very good. Inside screen is nice. Software is good enough quality but could be much better. Phone book is poor quality. I used bluetooth with belkin adapter and after a couple of tries it works for file transfers.I had SonyEricsson T610 before this phone and I loved it. I think I will not miss T610 over time."
4,Overall good phone,I've had this phone for about a year now. As a phone its pretty good as far as voice quality and reception. It fits well in the palm of the hand and in pocket. The keyboard is very handy for entering info into the phonebook. The Camera also takes good pictures for a phone camera.My phone did have an issue with charging and retaining charge of the battery (as also mentioned by someone else in their review). I took it to a local T-Mobile store and they filled out a warranty form to get it exchanged and received a replacement in 4 days. So far no problems with the replacement phone.Overall functions very well as a phone and is very stylish. Just watch out for potential issue with charging and retaining charge
4,"Great phone, lots of features, long battery life, but blocky","Have had this phone for a long time. It has very good service (about the same as any phone), but battery lasts a good long time, and has lots of great features. If you get MOTOROLA'S MOBILE PHONE TOOLS this a very fun phone. You can down load mp3s to ringtones, add photo wallpapers, and download your photos and video's from the phone. The memory is not removable to you are stuck with what you have, it is blocky, the web browsing is only WAP pages no true internet, but not bad, the keyboard is easy to use, the screen is bright, sharp and easy to see, bluetooth works fine. I would recomend for a texter, or someone who likes to take photos and likes bar phones."
1,Neat gadget...useless phone,"I initially liked this phone and had no complaints about it until it started to shut down whenever I would hit the end call button on the phone, right after I ended a call. I called T-Mobile to get another phone thinking that it may just have been a glitch in my original phone, but it isn't!! After complaining to T-Mobile again about the replacement phone, customer service informed me that it's a known problem with the phone and that there is nothing that they can do about it. So, I'm pretty much stuck with a useless phone! It doesn't matter what else the phone does, because it shuts off all the time without my knowledge. There has been dozens of times where I pull my phone out to use it and realize that it's shut off already. My family and friends are so annoyed at me because they say I never turn my phone on. What a piece of crap!! Don't buy it. Look for something else!!!!"
4,"good phone, moto needs to live with their own phones a while","My moto v66 recently had a display failure, shopped til I found a630 at great price (amazon) and have had phone for a week. Phone has better reception that the 66 and feels more durable. For a candy bar phone it is small, only a little bigger than the flip phones I've always used, fits easily into pockets.Tones are clear and loud, if a little difficult to find, the items menu on the 66 was more easily accessed. Menus you need the most are placed in more remote areas. Also moto has poor charging hardware which always seem to bend and lose contact resulting in ""unable to charge"" messages, hasn't happened yet but with same hardware I know it's in my future. Screens are excellent, large, bright, easily read. Headset works great. A good phone but a little extra thought would have made it one of the best."
4,"great for early adopters, but still a bit buggy","The concept of the phone is terrific. I have to use a 2-way pager for work, and instead of carting around a cell phone and bulky pager, I now just have this one small item. And while I didn't think I'd really use it, the Bluetooth functionality has definitely sold me. I can use it not only for a wireless headset, but to connect to the internet and to transfer sound files back and forth as well.The software of the phone seems to be a bit buggy still, unfortunately. When I lock the keypad, I still sometimes hear tones when the keypad is pressed and the display lights up. The menus are sometimes slow to respond, delaying as much as 2 full seconds (doesn't sound like much, but it can be irritating).Overall, I'd buy the phone again without hesitation, but I'm an early adopter. If you're willing to put up with the occassional buggy behavior, I'd definitely recommend this phone."
2,"Good for texting, nothing else","This is a bad phone. It's slow, the interface is more complicated than sin, and the reception is bad (possibly because of T-mo, but anectdotal evidence suggests otherwise). It's excellent for tapping out text messages, which I do a lot of. I will not be buying another Motorola phone, unless they entirely revamp the interface. Especially the address book, which lists the phone numbers without telling you whether or not the numbers are for a cell, or home, or fax, or whatever. It's really annoying.Don't get this unless texting is your main thing, and the phone part is an afterthought. It wouldn't even get two stars except that the qwerty keyboard is excellent."
2,Flashy but impractical,"I knew when I ordered this phone it had undersized keys and a problematic bluetooth implementation. I did not realize that with the small size came less than adequate signal reception, a screen that is invisible outdoors, and a user interface with many problems. example: The phone features voice dialing. Good luck figuring out how to set up voice strings that the feature can use.This one is going back."
2,Absolutely no software provided,"Overall the phone is decent, with good speakerphone quality and is quite well summarized in all the other reviews. One thing however that surprises me and that no one has mentioned before is the fact that the phone does not have *any* accompanying software either on a CD or for download.So, if I have to move my 100+ contacts from my old Nokia 3650 to my new A630, I have to either punch it in manually or fork out atleast $30 for purchasing the software. I feel that it is total BS to have to fork another $30 for a phone that retails at $350 for getting functionality that is pretty standard on most other phones. (My 3650 had the software bundled for free.)I feel that this is appalling! Hence my relatively low rating! Guess, I have no other option but to fork over another $30 and get the stupid software."
3,Mortorola needs to catch up!,"Keypad is the most attrative part of this phone. The inside screen is too small even smaller than a filp phone. The feather is very easy and simple. The menu letter is very small so it's hard to see it. If you don't send sms messager a lot, go with other choice!"
1,It suckz!,"It looks cute but it's not a phone u would use everyday. The first time I got it, it wouldn't charge after just a week. I tried all the chargers we had and when we really couldn't charge the phone, we returned it to the dealer we got it from and they exchanged it because it was defective. After 6 months, now I'm having the same problem with charging it. The batt is dead and I can't even exhange it anymore. My other friends who has the same phone as me has the same problem with it too. I don't recommend it."
1,Not worth the money or time,"This phone is great for the first 6 months* The design of the phone is hard to beat!However, This is third phone T-mobile has sent me that WILL NOT CHARGE. The T-mobile store does not cell the phone anymoe and Motorola has not created a follow up phone. The phone is obviously defected."
4,Had some problems ... now doing well,"The phone is very handy with a good keyboard and lots of features. The problem with my first phone was a malfunction of several keys (""1"", ""8"", and green talk button). They did not work, so I exchanged it within the first month. Two months later, the microphone stopped working. I could hear people, but they couldn't hear me. Hopefully 3 times is a charm. I have had the current phoen for 4 months with no further problems. I've had no charging problems like other people. I also have poor reception in my house, but I'm not sure if it's the phone or T-mobile."
2,it's not all that !,"I just received this phone a week ago, and I hate it. The battery life sucks, the keys are too slow, menus are confusing. It does look cool though. Oh yeah, the speakerphone doesn't work unless an optional equiptment is purchased."
2,Disturbing,"Instead of ringing, this phone just sits silently on my desk and judges me.I don't need that."
2,It can't charge now!!!,"I don't like this phone. The t-zone service is bad (compared with Sprint),I can't check any of my emails. I have just used this phone for about 20 days and it won't charge now. I don't know how to do with it, can I just go to the local retail store to have it changed or do I have to send that back to amazon? Who can help me with it?"
3,Motorola A630 Phone,I bought this phone about a month ago and its my 3 phone!! Its pretty funny but yet horrible.. The phone is really good but try not to let it fall ever!!
3,Don't say it is new if it is not,Disappointed that the item we received was used and not sealed in its original wrapping. If it says it is new when you are buying it then it should be new. It played fine so we will keep it. But probably not order from that vender again.
3,A fun read but Wasserstrom book was more helpful for me,"Great pictures and pleasant, friendly tone, but no price information and just generally not a good practical reference. This book has more narrative (the story of Bakelite, what the collecting world is like, the author's personal experiences, etc.) -- as opposed to the Wasserstrom book which has more practical how-tos. Grasso's book mentions the famous ""Philadelphia bracelet"" but then doesn't bother to show you a picture of one! And I think there was little if any mention of Galalith and other Bakelite-type products, and how to tell the difference."
5,A great book for the begining collector,"The first time I saw this book was on a recent Bakelite hunt in Italy. The wonderful colors and unusual piece on the cover caught my attention right away. The book gives the begining collector the information needed to tell the difference between bakelite and other plastics, by smell, touch and sound. It also gives information other books forget-how to find it, buy it, and then take care of it once it's yours. Tony Grasso makes bakelite collecting a fun and enjoyable hobbie for all ages. I have bought a second copy of this book for my teenage daughter who has now caught the ""Bakelite Bug"". If I had seen this book on Amazon before going to Europe, I would have not purchased the book in Italy and carried it half way around the world!"
5,"If you only buy one Bakelite jewelry book, this is the one","Well written, informative book. Great pictures. Terrific for the beginning collector as well as a seasoned bakelite hunter. Highly recommended. Mr. Grasso has a fun, easy to read style."
3,"Poor packaging, hissing ruins a master","Sony has packaged this in such a way that when the discs are removed form the holder they become scratched. Also it must be played at low volume for the hiss. Too bad, because Tureck is the master of Bach."
3,hiss and bad packaging,"Sony has packaged in such a way that when you remove the discs form the holders they become scratched. Also a persistant hiss when recording is above low volume. Too bad, as Gilels with Beethoven and Rubinstein with Chopin, Tureck is the master of Bach."
2,The Dragon's boy,"Artos, an orphan, housed since birth by sir Ector and Lady Marion. Artos is in many ways just like Rudolph the red nosed reindeer. Until one day when he must go out into the woods in search of Sir Ector's missing brachet hound. He enters a cave in hopes that the hound is within, but instead of a hound he finds an old, but very wise dragon. From the knowledge that the dragon gives Artos, he is able to befriend and become an equal to Cai, Bedvere and Lancot, three boys around his age but much higher in ranking, or so it seems.It is a well-written book, but I didn't really like the style it was written in, it is also a slow moving book, so if you like slow moving books this is a good book for you. She went into a lot of detail about stuff that never happens, like what would happen if the dragon ate him. It's an okay book if you have nothing better to read, but lots of detail, which is okay sometimes but not always."
2,Disappointing arrangements,"The good news is that Petula Clark sings wonderfully. She has a beautiful voice, and interprets the songs very well. The bad news is most of the arrangements are poor. It was disappointing more me to cringe in hearing songs I like and was looking forward to hearing her sing."
1,Read this book together with Dan Neuharth's book,"Al Neuharth's son, Dan Neuharth, has written a book called: ""If You Had Controlling Parents: How To Make Peace With Your Past and Find Your Place In the World"" [...]If you read the son's book first and then read this book, you will find Al Neuharth's view of himself as ""lovable"" quite a fantasy. The son's book is excellent help for adult children of narcissistic parents, and quite well reviewed, unlike this book.I'm not sure that success in business or publishing even requires the enormous betrayals Al Neuharth performed to others in his industry or to his family."
3,Worth a read,"Confessions is an unusual book in that along with useful business-oriented advice you also get a healthy dose of a fairly unpleasant personality of Al Neuharth, the founder of USA Today. The advice is grounded in Al's experiences as he left as a poor worker on a SD farm and worked his way to become founder of a major national newspaper. He is open about some of the mistakes that he has made but is even more open about things that helped him rise above the rest and reach the things he has achieved. The advice is practical. For example, Al liked to manage by memos which tended to end with ""Fix this"". He micromanaged areas that needed that level of attention and stepped away when things worked well. He used connections to achieve his goals. He was very good at reading people. These are just some examples, there are many more.This is worth a read if you have a mature system of values."
1,Terrible,"Of the 30+ business/motivational books I've read, this is by far the worst. Al Neuharth is someone I've always respected for being successful, especially when everyone doubted him, but his book is basically a bragging session. It gives no real advice, unless your a millionaire trying to make deals with Unions and the President. Definately pass on this one."
2,Confessions of an S.O.B.,"Talk about self-absorbed...I guess the ego and the love of self this man displays are essential to success in business...I thought the man made some good points, but few are helpful to anyone in the real world (or outside the newspaper business). Nausea sets in after the second chapter. Neuharth will die an old, lonely, rich man. Respected by many, hated by nearly all. Luckily, I didn't have to sit through this entire book. I put it down quickly."
1,What a sad man,"Mr. Neuharth is indeed a sad and cynical man. He equates 'elitism' with critical thinking and casts himself as a man of the people, just listening to their opinions via his polls and town meetings. And yet he talks of his fancy jets and other staples of his lavish and selfish lifestyle."
1,"Excellent music, but...",Buy the same exact EP online from the artist's record label (Sub Pop) for far less money than Amazon wants for it. What a rip-off!!!
4,communion cups...,"communion cups and someone's coat is a fine, fine song and worth the eleven bucks. i just wish sam beam would put more music on his albums, period, and quit releasing singles and EPs. but i will purchase it anyway, and so will you! you can also get these songs for cheaper off iTunes, but who wants to deal with all that encrypted music?"
5,Great value,"A lot of people complain about the list price. Ya, LIST price is high, as always. ""13 used & new from $5.69"" --that's what I pay attention to though, everything I buy is new and CHEAP!! All it takes is a scroll down the listings to find a good deal on a new cd. Granted the shipping is slow from 2/3 of the companies.. but hey its cheap."
3,Misleading Label,The ring it's self is beautiful. But while it says ZIRCON it is ZIRCONIA!!!!(there is a BIG difference) I confirmed this with the people at Sabrina Silver. While the ring is great and worth the price don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a different stone. Aside from that I am pleased. The stones are a little whiter than the picture but not to the point of making it a bad CZ.
5,The ultimate resource,"While there are more and more books available on making boards effective, no other author seems to bring together anything more than miscellaneous ideas. John Carver, on the other hand, lays out a full system for board clarity and accountability.I read his ""Boards That Make a Difference"", and was thrilled to see someone finally offer a way to make sense of boards. As a consultant, I've become an avid advocate of his Policy Governance model, which when used, virtually assures elevated governance.With this new book, Carver continues to impress. Rather than a conceptual text, this collection of over 100 articles addresses nearly every conceivable structural issue boards face, as well as the myths surrounding Policy Governance.To have all of this relevant information in one place is an incredible gift, another great addition to Carver's contributions to the nonprofit world, and any others interested in making boardroom activity meaningful and productive."
5,Comprehensive and Interesting,This book is a great book for someone who knows basic crochet but would like to develop their skills further. The success of the book is the result of excellent photographs and a logical progression of more difficult and involved stitchery. The basics are given at the beginning of the book. Each subsequent chapter introduces a more involved crochet skill and then a project to practice your newly acquired skill. All the projects in the book are contemporary and beautiful crochet pieces. A truly outstanding crochet book.
4,Good for beginners!,"This book was fantastic in helping me learn to crochet. I admit, I had some trouble getting past the foundation chain (like swimmergirl said), but after reading the directions a few times, I understood what they were saying. It's also very helpful because it throws in different terminology (letting you know some people all a triple crochet a treble crochet). The author only uses ""stitch"" and ""chain"" interchangeably when talking about the foundation chain, where a chain is a stitch. Now when I go to look at other crochet patterns, there's no confusion in reading the pattern and I'm able to do any pattern with ease. Four stars for the unclear beginning...but once you get started, this book helps you to get as far as you'd like to go!"
5,crochet basics,Very pleased to get this book which arrived in good order and was priced competitively. Your service is appreciated Thanks.
5,great book for beginners,"Great book for beginners who want to start crocheting. I am a beginner and only knew one patter when I started this. This book is great. It tells you everything you need to know about crocheting such as tools, types of yarn and patterns. There are pictures in it that shows you step to step moves. It doesnt reall have good projects though. I am a young lady in my 20s and I am not interested in making anymore scarfs or blankets. I know how to make those already. I use this book for the patterns and it is a good book to look back if I forget how to do a certain stitch"
4,Great House Song,"The lyrics say it all - this music will make you dance. It's not a mainstream song (such as Britney Spears), but it is one the most popular House mixes. Expect to hear this song at the clubs and get ready to dance!"
2,Biggest dissapointment of '05 so far.....,"I've had this album for a couple of months now, and I really wanted to hold my tongue because there aren't a lot of positive things to say about this release. O.G. Bobby Johnson suffers from too many wack guest appearances (not including the Camu Tao guest spot on ""Lately""). Another big problem is these producers he dug up make some pretty weak beats. I normally like hearing different underdog producers but these guys haven't blown up for a very good reason, they're below average on the boards plain and simple. The only beats that are kinda dope are ""P.P.P."", and the El Da sensei dis-a-thon ""Toxic"". I hate to say it, but even Tames word play sounds a bit stale here, he even recycles a couple of lines from When Rapper Attack. Personally I think he needs to put the sherm down, and go back to the drawing board because this is not worthy material from the guy who brought us Those Artifacts bangers back in the day, or the more recent Water World album."
3,Very Nice Recipes,"However, I find many of these recipes to be too much bother or too fancy to mess with when cooking for two kids. I'm afraid I just prefer plain, easy stove to table cooking and this book was not what I was looking for.Gorgeous pictures and good directions as well. Everything I have tried has turned out well."
5,Ted Nugent: Motor City Mayhem,"I love Uncle Ted. His 6,000th concert has to be one of his best. He brings the rock, and a few surprise guests and surprise songs along this rock n' roll thrillride of full bluntal nuggity! Buy it if you're a Ted-Fan!"
1,His music is OK but he's one vulgar dude,"OK, so I'm one of the few rockers who is offended by vulgar language. If you are not one of the other 7 rockers in the whole world who feels the same you might really like this show. I like several of Uncle Ted's songs, especially Hey Baby. All his best songs are featured in this show and the band does a respectable job on every one-- not a great job but pretty good... same for Ted himself. If he had just kept his dialogue rated PG13 I would not have thrown the disk in the trash. On the bright side, I've used the blu-ray box to replace a damaged one I had for a Bad Company disk."
