5,Received item as promised.,"I bought this item as a Christmas gift for one of my grandaughters, I think she will like it and it was delivered on time as promised. Thank you"
3,A great movie,This little gem kept the kids rooted for almost the entire show. It was so relaxing to see them in one spot.
5,Precious,I love this movie so much. I have watched it with all of my nieces and nephews and they love it too. The colors are vibrant and the fairies are a delight!
3,"Not the Tinkerbell we know, but...","I agree with the reviewers who say this is not the same Tinkerbell we know from the Peter Pan movie--this Tinkerbell would never be jealous and mean to Wendy, and it seemed even more off when Wendy appeared at the end of this movie... BUT, my 3 year-old princess loves this movie, and taken on its own, it is a pretty cute story."
4,Fluttering Tinkerbell,"Overall I got my money's worth and my daughter loved it for Christmas, the shipping was prompt and well packaged. I will look to make further purchases from this Site and Company in the future. Thank you for make this a special Christmas for me and my kids."
2,Cute meaning-just isn't Tink,"The meaning behind the movie (be yourself) is great, I just can't get passed Tink's voice- it was the wrong choice. My Husband and I came up with scenarios (I use his account) 1. Tink loses her voice eventually when She meets Peter 2. A Fairies voice is so tiny that to humans it hears like bells. I know they are making more than one movie-but why? unless they plan on showing how she finds Peter as a baby and takes him to Neverland. Wendy was also in the movie at the end (thats who the music box belongs to) Tink doesn't like Wendy... I dunno, it just seems sorta off. Still my 16 month old daughter loves it and wants to watch it all the time."
2,Slightly dissapointed,"My 4 year old daughter was looking forward to this since she saw the first commercials. She got the DVD for CHristmas, however, after about 20 minutes she said she did not like it and to please stop it. I do not know what she did not like, and I know that this may still become her favorite, but I was a little bummed out.The animation does look great."
5,Tinkerbell; She not just for kids anymore,"I saw Peter Pan as a boy when it first hit the theaters. Yes I know; I'm giving away my age. Back on topic, I thought Tinkerbell was the only good thing in that movie. That, and flying over a foggy London at midnight.I was chronically late for scout meetings because I had to see the opening scene from Disney's Wonderful World of Color which featured the Tinkster making magical fireworks.In this movie, I was once again charmed by the character.Suspend your cynicism and let the movie take you to a simpler, sweeter place and time. The world will still be there when you get back."
4,very cute,"It's a cute movie, definitely geared more towards the young girls in your life I have bought several copies to include 1 for my niece has a bareable story line for adults to watch."
4,Good movie from the Tinkerbell Line,"Disney has done a very good job and making the ""direct to DVD"" movie quality and entertaining. My daughter loves Tinkerbell and this DVD movie, though not great, is very good and fun for the audience it seeks to entertain."
1,NEVER RECEIVED AND NEVER RECEIVED A RESPONSE ABOUT IT MISSING,I have never received this item. I also never received a response from the vendor about it missing when I emailed to get info on it 2 weeks ago.
1,bootleg copy,"I was sold a bootleg copy. I will never buy from amazon again if this is the type of quality im going to get. Also, I ordered the movie on December 2nd and did not receive it until after Christmas. I am very disappointed in Amazon!!!!!!!!"
3,America is behind in animation...,"The fairies aren't quite up to the Japanese standards for animations.The skin and wings and shape are not up to the quality of the soundtrack?At one time Disney set the standard, but even a child can see thatthese drawing aren't as well done?The story, dialog and plot-line are better than the actual animation.If you are taking about ""magic"" and the land of Faerie, then you have to have the shine and glamor that is fantasy in the telling, in the imagination.For me the drawing fell short of what they should be:that is the fault of the art director.No one would notice if there weren't better work that these can be compared to!"
1,Disney's touch of porn,"If this were just more of that cloying pap that today's Disney churns out, it would be one thing. If you were merely disappointed at the lack of artistry in today's ""physics-based"" 3d animation, it would be another. If stripping out the best of western lit's essential messages is somewhat troublesome, it would be another. But pitching the classics as teenage mall characters with sexy clothes that would never be permitted in a high school is a part of the sorry ruination of culture and morality that truly illustrates the central mission of this greedy corporation. Better read your kids Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road"" if you want to see the end of this story."
5,So Sweet!,"Such a dear sweet movie! I just finished watching it with my six year old daughter, and I am very pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed it myself. It held her interest the whole time, and it had has a nice storyline with a message about believing in yourself, and being happy with who you are. I would recommend this movie to all!"
2,Tinker Bell,"Not the type of story I would have put together for the story of Tinker Bell. Having been a fan of Tink since I was a child in the 60's it does not do the forever young fairy justice. It's too 21'st century teenage crap, should have stayed true to fairydom and not put the human teen twist into it. The illustration is nice and well done, but not to the true likeness of Tinker Bell. Quite disappointing, if you are a long time Tinker Bell officianado this will not be worth your time."
1,SCRATCHED!,This item was rated as good condition. It was not good condition. It was all scratched from the previews through the whole movie. I can't even watch it. My daughter was very dissapointed in this Christmas present.
3,It was okay,"I got the dvd and the case was broken, also when i opened the dvd it was filthy like dog or child had been given it as a toy. Its not hard to clean an item before you sell it. Also, after cleaning it it had many scratched on it. No i must sit through the entire movie to make sure it plays without glitching or stopping before i give it to my child. sometime paying an extra $10 is worth getting one brand new."
2,Not Recommended,"If my daughter hadn't liked it, it would only get 1 star from me. Tinkerbell has a snotty attitude, and speaks/treats people rudely. If not for that, it would've been a cute girly movie but the example from the main character is just too poor."
4,Fairy Dust,"A gift for my 4 year old granddaughter, It didn't make ""favorite"" status nut she seemed to enjoy it."
5,Ding Ding Ding...we have a winner!,"My grandkids are a super gauge of what is good or not, they've watched this one literally 14 times or more and can't get enough of it, this one I've watched with them a few times and it's great!"
3,A Simple Book,"The greatest achievements in Hockey are celebrated in this book as well as simple rules. There is additional information on the side bars of each page. And for someone who knows nothing about hockey, this book taught me a lot. It also kept the attention span of my oldest, which is not always easy to do.Mr. Napier put a lot of information into terms most younger kids could understand. I was impressed as well as how interactive the book was as well. I definitely would love to read more of this author's work."
5,Nephews LOVED it!,I sent this as a gift to my nephew who is 5 years old and a huge hockey fan when he got a hat trick. Although he's not reading yet he loved the book which his Dad and older Brother read to him. This is NOT an ordinary counting book - it contains all sorts of useful information about hockey. It is the type of book that kids and adults will want to refer to more than once. Since this is what I was looking for I'm really happy!
2,Poor quallity,"This Buxton replaced a 10 year old Buxton that is better quality than this new one.The new Buxton leather is much more thin and the clasp on the coin purse does not work correctly, difficult to open and close."
3,Leather & Plastic,I have purchased many of the Buxton Heiress Leather Cardex wallets over a number of years. The Amazon description made no mention that the product had a leather exterior BUT plastic interior. It was only described as leather. I may have purchased it with a plastic interior but am disappointed that there was no mention of the obvious change made to the wallet at some time since I purchased retail.
3,Not quite like they used to make them,"I am disappointed that the interior parts of these cardexs are no longer leather. I have had 2 or 3 over the past 25 years, and they were all leather. I doubt that this one will last as long. At least it is the same size and shape with the similar sections that I really love."
3,Good,My only wish is that the change purse portion closed better. Why does this say I need so many words.. If it's my review?
5,I found it!,"My mom really likes this type of wallet-- one that holds a lot of credit cards, cash and spare change. I like the color. Previously she had a rust colored one. This wallet is very durable, lasting for years. I highly recommend it!"
3,Please read the description first,"This is not a professionally produced instructional video. Tim Miller is not responsible for the quality of this product and there is what could be considered a disclaimer in the description of it on the mauiyoga.com website (follows):This DVD is a raw documentation of a class taught by Tim one morning at the House of Yoga and Zen on the island of Maui. This was not intended to be a polished video, but a historic record of an actual class."
1,crap,"I don't have much to say, it's a low quality video of Ashtanga Primary series. Waste of money. Don't buy it."
5,Ancient Greeks Still Relevant,"As religious fanaticism makes a big comeback in the US it is important to remember that rational understanding has a longer tradition in the West than the popularity of the current most widespread organized supersitions. This book gathers under one cover most of the major philosophical systems of the Hellenistc Greeks-- the Epicureans, Stoics and the Skeptics (always valuable to read as an antidote to dogmatism). Neo-Platonists (from whom the Christians copped their theology) are also represented--i.e., Philo and Plotinus. There is also a section on early Chrisitan ""thought""-- ""With our faith, we desire no further belief""-- Tertullian ( of 'credo quia absurdum' fame). Having all this variety of philosophy and anti-philosophy in one book will give you a good mental workout."
3,Needs greater philosophers,"I gave this book a very condiscending review a couple of years ago, and I admit I was far too critical... It does have its flaws, but I reviewed it without a thorough enough reading of it, and the faults are not with the author, but with the simple fact that there just weren't any really forceful philosophers living in this age. I give it three stars instead. I offer my aplogies to the author, and anyone else who may have been mislead by my previous rview. I give it three stars."
1,A Sad Joke !,"Seriously, I still can't figure out how this book made it to printing: flat clichés, poor development, useless references to God / religion, and 70 pages which could have fit in just 1 sentence, and even so it would have been a lame one ...""Be good, do you work, and make good choices in life"" ...No Kidding!!!As the book says, your greatest power is your power to chose, and since there are many many other self-help books which are far far better than this one, so apply your Greatest Power and chose to skip this sad joke!"
1,He is much better than this!,"Generic smooth jazz from an artist who can deliver so much more and should be allowed to do so. The few glimpses of individuality on this Cd are buried under layers of smooth jazz cliches: that same drum track that shows up on everything Paul Brown touches, unobtrusive sax solos, and string synths. This is a pleasant unobtrusive listening experience, presumably for background music at upscale social events and corporate offices..his others have been full of bright moments and inspiration and provided a soundtrack for the parts of my life that were not spent in a cubicle."
2,SMOOTH JAZZ HUM DRUM,"OK... This CD isn't bad. It isn't that good either.I'm NOT a big smooth jazz fan. But once in a while, I find some gems from that genre, such as The Rippingtons' ""Black Diamond"", Paul Taylor's ""On The Horn"", and Craig Chaquico's ""Acoustic Highway"". CDs like these, in my opinion, transcend an otherwise bland genre because of the distinctive, original style of the performers and/or because of original, fresh melodies that grab you; whether your a smooth jazz fan or not! Chaquizo's ""Acoustic Highway"" was such an effort. It was the first of his CDs that I had ever heard and I love it now as much as I did two years ago. So, on a whim, I purchased this one. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. Gone is the melodic originality of his first effort. Who's CD is this anyway? Chaquico's? Rick Braun's? Stan Freeman's? To me, it sounds like the bland smooth jazz that I avoid on a regular basis. I'm going to get rid of this one and check out some of his earlier efforts after ""Acoustic Highway."""
2,Not Enough Craig!!,"I agree with the previous listener in that there isn't enough ""Craig"" music on the CD. I guess I am spoiled by his first 2 CDs -- in that his beautiful acoustic guitar is ""out front"" on every song. I don't like his cross-over into smooth jazz -- for one, because I know he can carry his own without all the help from his friends. I hope on his next CD, he will go back to his original Acoustic Highway/Acoustic Planet flavor."
3,Not enough Craig,"I was real excited to find out that there was a New Craig Chaquico CD. To many guest musicians, it's nice to have friends on your CD but I don't feel like I bought a Craig Chaquico CD. Basically if I wanted to hear Rick Brunn, I would listen to my Rick Brunn CD...if I wanted to listen to 3rd Force I'll listen to my 3rd Force CD. Although teaming up with Russ Freeman on ""The Drifter"" is a refreshing new sound (and the CD `From the Redwoods to the Rockies'. is excellent) It's a nice CD but I'm a little disappointed I wanted to hear more guitar."
3,could be better,"I have heard nothing but good things about Baron Baptiste, so I decided to buy this DVD. I was very disappointed in him. He is so annoying thoughout this entire DVD. The poses and direction is good (it is basic) but his method of speaking is pretty irritating...not relaxing. I would recommend this DVD if you can get it at a low, used price. It's not terrible....but I expected more."
4,Good Workout,"I've had this one for a while - I practiced this one today for the first time in over a year and I liked it. It's challenging. My spine has some issues and it feels a little warm right now but doesn't hurt. 3rd segment for the abs is amazing - borrows from Pilates mat.Level one for power yoga, not for absolute beginners however. You should be somewhat physically fit and have a knowledge of basic yoga poses/alignment before trying this."
1,The DVD goes blank at three places,"The content is great, but the DVD quality is poor.It goes blamk at three places for a few minutes each while the sessions are on.It is pretty disgusting."
3,OK beans not the best around,The beans were kind of very dry. Wasn't very easy to work with. However at the price you couldn't beat them during that time.
5,Madagascar Vanilla Beans,The vanilla beans were fresh when I received them with an outstanding flavor. I made homemade vanilla ice cream and using store bought would have never worked. Thanks
2,"Good News, Bad News","I heard parts of this CD on the radio, and immediately researched the music until I found LAGG: LATIN. The first six bands are ho-hum, something to skip through just to get to the seventh band which begins selections from Carmen. So half of the CD is enjoyable, too bad it isn't the first half!"
3,Reconsider,"Probably fine for the guitarist wanting to appreciate some good licks, but not pleasant or soothing music for listening. I gave mine away."
2,Accurate title,"I thought this film had everything before getting it: National Lampoon humor, Vanessa Angel (see 'Kingpin' available on Amazon--she's the hottest female ever born...), and the fact it was filmed 2 miles from my home in Ventura.In the event(as the Brits say), it was dreadful. Not funny, no surfing footage to speak of, no Vanessa Angel that I could discern, it was unfunny, unsexy, and uninteresting.If you want surfing, get 'Endless Summer'. If you want National Lampoon humour, get 'Christmas Vacation'; if you want Vanessa Angel, get the aforementioned 'Kingpin', all available on DVD."
5,Zandelle Twilight on Humanity ... by Demon5563,"This album really Rocks!!! This Power/Speed Metal is True!!! The Vocalist has amazing range, and hit's all the high notes.The music is both intense and dynamic. This band has range, and should go really far.Zandelle will conquer The World!!! True Heavy Metal Lives!!!Rock On!!!"
2,"Geriatric""boy singer""","When Wyane Newton first burst upon the scene some forty years ago,singing""danke Schoen""and""daddy don't you walk so fast"" he WAS a boy singer,with a boy's unfinished voice...He still has that same voice today,sounding for all the world like some neutered slouch crooning at the local gaybar...Newton went on to an interesting career as a one-time vegas casino mogul,he played the villian in one of leslie Neilsen's""naked Gun""movies,and currently spends a lot of his time in Branson,Missouri,the poor man's Atlantic City,singing falsetto lounge for retired housewives and other geriatrics...If this is what moderns think ""lounge""is all about then they are sadly mistaken...Like Mrs Miller and quite a few other notable goof performers,these acts always were of the""NOVELTY""sort,like Jerry Lewis crooning ""Rock a bye your baby with a dixie melody""...Indeed,listening to Lewis ,Newton,and Mrs Miller side by side,I find it hard to tell them apart..."
1,Beware! This book is about Exchange 5.0,"Beware! The title of this book is misleading, because the contents and illustrations are describing Exchange 5.0 (not Exchange 5.5)You may choose to verify the following: (1) Recipient Mailbox properties -""Advanced"" tab- it shows the Exchange 5.0 version (This is different from the Exchange 5.5 version) (2) The installation for Exchange describe per server option (Note: Exchange 5.5 has only per seat option).Here are some good books which you may want to use to study for your MCSE Exchange 5.5 exam:(1) MCSE: Exchange Server 5.5 Study Guide (from Sybex) ISBN: 0782122612(2) Sams Teach Yourself Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 in 21 Days ISBN: 0672315254(3) Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Administrator's Companion ISBN# 0-7356-0646-3However, if you are looking for Exchange 5.0 book, this is the book you might to take a look."
4,Good overall Study Guide,"I have bought a number of books to study the Exchange Server 5.5 exam. Each book has its merits over the others.This book gave a good overall understanding of the subject. Not evey aspect is covered in depth - yet the book is not aimed at beginners so I expected this.An enjoyable book to read, that certainly helped me prepare for the Exchange 5.5 exam.My only critisism would be that the questions at the end of each chapter were fairly easy and didn't made me think enough about the subject. But there are lots of example questions on NET so I wasn't too concerned about this."
2,beginners class of ashtanga yoga,"I thought I was buying a level three challenging work out. However, Baron says on the DVD that this is a beginner's class. It certainly wan't challenging for someone looking for more advanced yoga. I didn't realize that this was an ashtanga yoga disc. I much prefer the flowing vinyassa style.I found his style of speaking to be a bit harsh - not very spiritual or inspirational. The positioning of the yogi's wasn't really good- they were all facing one another in a line and it didn't allow very good camera angles."
2,"Creative, but not relaxing, just experimental",It literally feels like you are frozen on ice the entire disc. It cant really be even called trip hop its more ambient noise...i dunno i dont usually think of iceland for its....ice...i like the nightlife and the indoors and the lights and the people.....if there was an underground chill cd for those who like to freeze to death this would be it....the cover is cool thats about it....
1,"Agree. Ripoff really 24"" T8","I have two of these on my 150 gallon. Cheap. I guess better than nothing but worth maybe $10 each. The hood is actually 34.5"" and the bulb is a 24"" T8 120v 17w 8,000k. Not quite junk but I've already ordered something better."
4,A solid EP with cool live tracks,"""Serenity in Murder"" is, in fact, a promo EP released somewherebetween 1994. and 1995. The title track is taken from ""DivineIntervention"" and is pretty good. But three live tracks are far more interesting. ""At Dawn They Sleep"" and ""Divine Intervention""are blowing you off, and the ""Dittohead"" is separating you intoatoms. That's real Slayer!"
3,The Seven Ravens,"I was disappointed with the graphics of this book, although the story abides in true Grimm style. I would still recommend the book for purchase."
4,The Case of the Murdered Players,"The Case of the Murdered PlayersIf you like suspense, or if you want to just read a book nonstop without even closing it than you will like the mystery, The Case of the Murdered Players. This book is about string of murders that just happened recently. All victims were killed the same way, stabbed. They were all actresses. The strange thing is the exact thing happened then years ago. One of the main characters, Andrews, mom is an actress and has been getting cards and notes that say I will be back. Thy need to find the murderer if they don't want any more murders. Andrews mother is especially in danger. I liked this book because it kept me wondering and guessing most of the time I was reading it. I liked the way it ended because I never would have guessed who the murderer was. I would recommend it to my friends."
4,valuable images of a bygone era,"While very disturbing, to say the least, the pictures in this book are a necessary part of a history that remains with us. The privileged life for a few in Shanghai, contrasted with the starving masses eking out a living in their midst. Draconic measures, executions and riots, an emigre community divorced from the reality of life in China. In seeing these pictures you see the beginning of the end of a regime--to be substituted by another of unknown pedigree. But the heartening thing is that through the pain and suffering you do not see people giving up. Look at these pictures and get a shot of adrenaline!!"
2,poor quality,This leash is made poorly and it arrives looking like it was left in the sun. The Cowboys logo is almost yellowish. Not happy with it at all. Shipping was awful too.
5,I Miss Ride,"Carnival of Light is one of those albums that one listens to for the rest of one's life. I bought this album when it was released in 1994 and have never set it aside for more than a week. Take a listen to this album and see what you think. The opening track, Moonlight Medicine, is a fantastic icebreaker that sets the tone for the rest of the album. This is Shoe Gazer pop at its best. Groovy, heavy layers of guitars, existential lyrics, and totally British. Now don't go confusing my description with classic guitar rock or acid rock. Ride is certainly flavored with a tinge of drug induced delusion, but more than anything this is music of dreams. I would highly recommentd this album to anyone who even remotely enjoys Oasis."
5,Underrated!,"A lushly produced, beautiful album that grows on you with each successive listen. While not rooted in the noisy feedback and shoegazing of their earliest releases, this contains some of Ride's best songwriting. ""Crown Of Creation"" may be their finest moment, while ""Only Now"" and ""From Time To Time"" are both beautiful and contain soaring choruses. It's a shame that many Ride ""fans"" dismissed this one initially, because it's a highly affecting, memorable album. Check it out for yourself!"
3,only now,"I'd been looking for a particular song from Ride entitled ""Only Now"" that seemed pretty hard to come by. The entire album sounds good, but honestly was just ecstatic to have a non-live version of ""only now""...awesome mellow rock ballad that conforms to nothing."
2,Ride found some Deep Purple lps in the basement....,"The qualities I usually associate with the band Ride...euphoria, mesmerizing bulldozers of fuzz -induced bliss, narcotic melody...are nowhere to be found on this record. Instead, it sounds like the band wanted to move away from the shoe gazing maelstrom of sound that turned people like me into nearly rabid fans, and experiment with the heavier psychedelic sound that Deep Purple was famous for. Though they pull it off admirably, you won't even find anything as good as ""Hush"" on this release (which is a shame, since most certainly could have pulled off a FAR better cover of the song than Kula Shaker managed to mangle!). If you find yourself constantly blasting ""Smoke on the Water"" out the windows of your '72 Duster, you may enjoy this albulm...but if you are expecting to find something akin to the glory that is Ride's ""Chelsea Girl, don't bother....."
2,"It's not ""DISNEY"" music, ignore Mickey Mouse on the cover","When I ordered this, I THOUGHT that it was going to be the Disney Characters singing Christmas classic songs. NOPE. The first song has a few voice dub ins, the rest are just normal songs. Nothing ""DISNEY"" about this CD, other than the cover art."
5,An example of jazz is and should be today.,"This is a fantastic cd. Rooted in the history and future of Bop, with modern elements i.e. psychedelic guitar, funky organ, etc... Elements of blues and even R&B. But this is definitley JAZZ. This you can tell is a working band, which relates to each other tightly on the pieces. Highly recommended!"
1,rusted!,I bought this item from a local store and loved the small size. It fits perfecly in a bathroom sink. After 2 weeks of using it the item started rusting underneath it!
3,Danco 88820 2-1/2-Inch Mesh Strainer,"The metal lip on this strainer makes it hard to grab to pickup and clean - that is the only con. The pro is the mesh is nice and tight which ensures it catches anything, hair included.Had the metal lip been bigger I would have given it a higher rating."
1,NOT-stainless steel strainer,"I thought this would be perfect and for the first couple of days it was, but thereafter it started rusting out underneath. It is wrong to call it stainless when it obviously isn't."
5,practical guidance for teens,"Laya Saul's book gives sage advice to teens and their parents about how to navigate the morally chaotic world around us. In addtion to sharing her own insights, she leads the reader to a wealth of other useful sources on critical life issues for teenagers, which, if followed, will enable young people to make wiser life decisions."
4,Graet book,"This is a great book for teens I wish that there was something like this for me as a young girl,"
4,A cute guide to trees for kids and parents alike...,"My kids find the Fandex format easy to use, and the information on them accessible. We have several, and they're fun for all of us to use together.I like the fact that each page has illustrations that show the leaf, bark, and seeds. There is a brief description of the tree, some history as well as typical usage. Each page has the following descriptive categories: Leaves; Bark; Flowers; Fruit or Cones; Seeds; Tree Shape; Habitat; Range; and Other Names. Mind you, this is not a complete and scientific field guide for adults, but rather a book a family can take out on a day hike and have fun using.The only quibble I have about these decks is that sometimes when they're completely fanned out, the edges of the illustrations get caught up in each other, making it hard to close them properly. But other than that, they're cute, informative, and a nice format for kids."
5,a stroke of genius,"I read a lot of field guides, and the format of this one is a stroke of genius. You match the leaf to the die cut leaves at the top of the ""book"" and you're well on your way. My kids also adore it."
2,Disappointment,"I was very disappointed with this ""book."" I felt the variety of trees found in this collection to be far too minimal. If you plan on learning about trees in the winter, good luck. The primary method for identification is based on leaves. Although you can identify trees based on bark, etc. it would take hours with this manual. Also, it is far to bulky and awkward to comfortably carry along on a hike."
3,more of a facts book than a guide,"I would use this ""guide"" more if I could ever find what i'm looking for, but they are organised alphabetically and not by type or shape. Although the cards provide great information it is difficult to find what tree you're looking at with these. They could be unscrewed and used differently, and there is an index. Kids think they're fun because of the leaf shapes and design, but they quickly get frustrated flipping through them. it's also hard to close because of the various leaf shapes. Overall it doesn't get used much because more often than not it doesn't have what i'm looking for, or enough trees to be worth using as an identification tool. If you want to teach kids basic trees this could be good, but I would start with what's in the yard, and only half of those are in this book."
1,Haven't read the book,This is to balance out the 5 star rating that the author gives to his own book.
2,Not quite what I'd hoped for,"As both a lover of mysteries and a dog trainer, one of my clients thought that I would greatly enjoy this book. I am sorry to say that I found the writing sophomoric, the plot simplistic, and the attempts at humor fell very flat. The dog training ""tips"" which my new client found so fascinating were very worrisome to me. I actually brought the book into my training classes as examples of what not to do with dogs. If you enjoy dimestore novels with almost comic-book plots, then this would be an enjoyable read. If you're looking for a serious mystery, then I suggest you look elsewhere."
2,Expected better quality,"I bought this item after a bit of research over the net. I have an HP computer, and since the bag is also from HP , I expected it to be well designed for HP computers and of course durable. It is well designed but it bit too heavier than I thought it would be. On the durability side, I am surprised to find that handles are coming lose. The threads are unraveling and as of now, the bag is not usable, because handles might break off. This has happened only after a normal usage and normal loads. The load included only a laptop, few documents, power adapter and a book of about half a pound!!Quite disappointed with the quality of this product. But there are chances that this might be defective piece. I am going to send it back to Amazon/HP and see what happens."
4,Smart idea!,Integrity Publishers Inc. has developed a truly unique form of scrapbooking. This album will save much time as the pages are already for picture inserts. Each page is self-explanatory and layouts are artfully designed. All you need to provide are your photographs and written thoughts.
1,Authentic RayBan Sunglasses,"They were authentic, but seller forgot to mention that they were refurbished. I brought them to a RayBan distributor and they fixed my crooked glasses for an additional $80!!!! I won't make the same mistake and try to get a deal on sunglasses ever again!"
5,Can last for ages,"Been using these sticks since the 17th century when they were gifted to me by a court magician. One of them finally broke today. As with most sticks, some pairs won't last as long as others, but the right pair will last through the ages. Thankfully the pair I bought must have been blessed by Druid monks because they survived through an eternity of abuse before snapping. I would buy them again but Guitar Center does not seem to accept gold coins as a form of currency."
5,Best of All!,"22 years drumming, using some kid of drum sticks, and I promark 5A is the best for me! I'm recommendating promark 5A series is the best drum stick in the world!"
4,Ray's Kitchen,Purchased this VHS to help in the training of my horses. Good purchase and reasonably priced. The shipment was shipped and received in a reasonable time.
3,Good for what it is.,"IE: a reference list of animal ingredients to look out for in your food/cosmetics, etc. Nothing that you can't find elsewhere on the web, but it's nice to have it summarized in one handy booklet."
4,Its alright.,"Its exactly what it sounds like, a giant list of animal ingredients listed alphabetical order. Its a bit thin of a book but it does what its suppose to."
2,Eh..,"Guess I didn't look over this book enough before I purchased it. I expected much more....than just a list of ingredients. This book has a list of ALL animal products...but for vegetarians who still allow certain things in their diets it doesn't decipher where the ingredient is actually derived from... and even if you are against all of the ingredients....... for my buck, I'd still like to be able to explain why a certain ingredient is not acceptable...other than ""uhh b/c its animal derived"""
4,Meant for early talkie/musical enthusiasts,"As my title states: meant for early talkie enthusiasts. Today's audiences would not give this movie a 5-minuet sitting. I believe you have to be interested in the period of history these early talkies came out and not judge them by today's standards. These period musicals were put togethter to present the numbers to audiences who never had a chance to see big-city productions. And, they do a fine job of it. The ""Hoosier Hop"" number is worth the price of the movie alone."
4,Eliades Ochoa,"The fact about Eliades Ochoa is that his vocal ability does not matter at all. He may not be the ideal, perfectly toned vocal artist, but that is what makes him so special. He sings from the heart, about things that move him deeply. His voice is like that of a father; deep and soothing. Theres just something deeper to Eliades Ochoa than simply the fact that he is not the emblematic ""singer"" and goes off key at times. He goes beyond that."
4,cuban blues,Soulful but gritty songs and effortlessly expressive solo and rhythm guitar from the man who was the guitar drive behind (and upfront of) Buena Vista Social Club. Comparisons to Johnny Cash have already begun. Criticizing this man's work because of his natural singing voice (like one reviewer who spends a paragraph over-analyzing it...) is missing the point and akin to criticizing blues players for less than brilliant singing. Perfect pipes aren't everything - I'd rather listen to Billie Holiday than Whitney Houston anyday.
5,The Sound of Great Music,Its the best of the best! Eliades Ochoa has certainly outdone himself.Each song unique and far superior to his other CD's. I highly recommend this one to anyone that truly enjoys good Cuban Guijiro music.
2,"a guitarist, not a singer","This could so easily have been a five-star review. The fact is, however, that while instrumentally this recording is just as good as others have said, Eliades Ochoa handles lead vocals throughout; and, despite the talk of ""his wonderfully ripe voice"", he's just not a singer. His voice would be good enough to demonstrate what he was after to a real singer, but that's about it. Or again, the tone is astringent enough to add some good bite alongside somebody who's a lot more mellifluous, but this is not a voice that most people would want to hear out in front, which is where it is. (Cf, in a very different genre, Hatfield and the North.) And all too often, it's out of tune.When I listen to this CD, I think of the title of a certain Zappa instrumental album (""Shut up 'n play yer guitar""). And then I quickly take off the CD and put on a disc by Antonio Machin or somebody else."
2,A scan of a text from 1895,"This is a print copy of a scan of a publication from 1895 (not kidding). Apparently it's from some sort of archive from University of California - there are numerous stamps from ""Library of the University of California"" on the pages. The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is because there is factual information in the book that remains true to this day - things like corrosiveness (of ammonia), explosiveness, specific heat and etc.Other than that this book is a historical curiosity."
3,"Quick, easy, lightweight intro to Socialism","If you are looking for a book to bolster your defense of, or attack upon, socialism, this is not the book for you. Instead, this short read provides an easy introduction into the development of Socialism, from its idealistic early proponents to those later in the 19th century attempting to define a more realistic socialism.While Engels provides an overview of the ""superiority"" of socialism over capitalism, his arguments helped me to understand the motivation for socialism, rather than providing a rigorous defense.As a libertarian, I don't agree with Engels that the capitalist exploits the wage laborer -- I think the stronger argument can be made that the capitalist enables the wage laborer -- but Engels does present his position clearly.If you are looking for a good, short introduction to socialism, this is the book for you."
3,Disappointed,"I love the information demonstrating the converence of science and spiritual matters that Gregg Braden brings, but had I known that this dvd is from a seminar held in the late 80's or early 90's I would not have purchased it. I feel a bit hood-winked. Additionally, I had a diffult time really listening to the message due to the props on the stage. Especially the ""picture"" of Jesus. This is simply too impertinent; especially, considering the people groups (the yellow, the black, the brown, and the red) who maintained these ancient documents through the ages."
2,walking between the worlds,"I was really dissapointed in this DVD,it was not what I had anticipated. I had expected more up to date information from Greg Braden.These workshop Dvds are really old.Dragged on for too long.I think that the information is out of date."
1,Terrible Design,"I have nothing against this books ""story"" or the song just the design of the book. At the back for this book is a wheel that spins and as you read through the book you spin the wheel so that all the ""little ones"" fall out of the bed. My son (1yr) loved this book and was in awe of the spinning wheel. However, the wheel is just ""set in"" the back page and not attached so it very quickly becomes difficult to turn the wheel. After about 10 reads it was nearly impossible to spin the wheel. This took all the fun out of reading the book, the while point is for the little ones to disappear off the bed. If it had a better design, this would be great but as it is I would not recommend anyone waste their money on it."
4,Massage Chair,This iJoy is awesome for the money and it is good looking. The massage quality on this almost equals what you get in chairs that go for a couple thousand.. pretty amazing. I compare it to the chair I tried at my chiropratic's office. I am sure that one cost up to 5000. The only thing is -- it could be a bit more comfortable to use as a regular chair for long periods of time.. a bit more cushioning would be nice. I def recommend it..
2,"Work OK for a while, then broke down","This was a good deal while it lasted, about 9 months and then it gradually lost function. First the up-and-down travel got intermittent, then conked out entirely, then power went out altogether. No local distributors- I bought it from Fry's, but they have discontinued it, so now I'm stuck with it. It was nice while it lasted. Good price for the functions if only there was a repair center or return oulet nearby. My advice in general is to look carefully at the warantees on these things. They will break down eventually."
2,THIS PRODUCT LEAKS.,"This is a shaker only in the sense that a fountain drink with a plastic lid is also a shaker. I've used mine only lightly, in my kitchen. I haven't even thrown it in my gym bag... good thing too, because IT LEAKS.There are two places it leaks, and you can see both in the picture provided. It leaks around the rim, where the orange lid meets the opaque cup. And it leaks at the hinge for the cap on top -- not through the cap itself, but at the spot where the cap is connected to the rest of the lid. IT LEAKS IN TWO PLACES. If you shake it, prepare to get a little wet.Yeah, it's only 2 something. But you get less than what you pay for. Put your dollars towards a more expensive higher quality shaker ... because that's what you're going to have to end up buying anyway."
5,Five Thumbs Up!,"I bought this book a year ago and never used it. After taking a class in Access and using it at work I found answers to problems that neither my teacher nor Access ""Help"" could answer. The format is short and sweet. It is truly for every user, beginner and advanced!"
4,Another great NOLO book...,I always go to the NOLO books when I want to learn to do something myself. This one is no exception. It's very informative without giving so much information as to be confusing. There are plenty of resources included in the book if you want to do further research. Beneficiaries should always be indicated and just keeping your papers all in one place is helpful. It's very aggravating to figure out what your deceased loved ones even owned but easy to do with this checklist to use as your step by step guide. Alot of it is getting the information together before it's needed. Great advice and I easily recommend.
4,A Fine Narative On A Complex Issue,"I found Mary Randolph's 267 page ""8 Ways To Avoid Probate"" interesting and informative. I had just started the process of laying the ground work of sealing off my small estate from the taxman.I'm still in the process and although the book was first copywrited in 1996, there have been steady updates, and this is the 8th edition. Further, there are free legal updates at Nolo.com.I am very pleased with the book so far, and may come back to write more as I near the end of the effort.Rossi"
5,Useful,"Like most NOLO books, this book is easy to understand, easy to read (due to the way it's formatted), and pretty comprehensive. It goes over specific legal strategies for avoiding probate, covering both the advantages and disadvantages; I think the references to old cases were particularly useful.While the book does mention some state specific laws, since I'm not a lawyer; I'm not sure how well it covers states individually.Overall I highly recommend this book to anyone over 30 with a family."
4,B-17 Flying Legend,"Overall--with all the extras--a fine piece. The new documentary is good, if a little self-serving. Sound quality of narration is weak and needs closed captioning. Extra interviews and photo albums are excellent. Shots of currently flying B-17s are good but should be longer. If you are into B-17s or WWII, you should get this one. You won't be disappointed."
5,Superb,"The best DVD on the market about the B17,brings tears to the eyes listening to the old veterans recall their stories of far off days....."
1,Puzzled,"I purchased this item because it was advertised as one with 'Randolph Scott'. However, he doesn't appear to be in any of movies.However, I did buzz throught the title sections of a couple of the movies and the transcription quality isn't what most of us expect on a DVD - actually quite fuzzy - to the point of not being able to read some of the names in the titles as they float by..."
2,not their best effort,"Waking Hours and Change Everything are two of my favorite albums. Twisted has one of my all-time favorite songs (Driving with the Brakes on). I admittedly had very high hopes for this album, which might explain my disappointment. Del Amitri's real strength lies is lyrics and music that illustrate the darker side of relationships. This album is just too happy. Bring back the misery."
2,Unoriginal And Repetitive,"I bought 'Some Other Suckers Parade' because I had heard a handful of Del Amitri songs on MTV during the years, which I all found pretty alright.But the album is boring. It's poppish rock with tiny aspects of folk. The singer is good, the musicians are OK - but the music itself is so uninspired and unoriginal.Why didn't they just release a single? 'Some Other Suckers Parade' contains 2 or 3 melodies, with 14 different (and banal!) lyrics. Only exception is the closing 'Make It Always Be Too Late' which has something, without being superb.If you like this style, I will recommend you The Rembrandts instead of Del Amitri. I find it difficult to write that this album is bad, it's just uninspired and boring."
3,series fires up too late [no spoilers],"""The Watcher Series"" continues three months later in ""Fire Watcher"" with Elise and new Watcher Remy, whose growls rattle windows and walls often, as the focal characters. The usual desire to touch and taste the other while staring and thinking ""I don't deserve him/her"" pervades the novel. It is obvious the series will not contain deep character growth but spontaneous action towards undeveloped and vague antagonists.Remy the Hunter faces off against the Brotherhood, a Dark organization dedicated to business and profit, in an attempt to prevent them from capturing fire witch Elise and a Talisman called the Trifero. What compels the Brotherhood's intentions is not revealed. Long overdue fight scenes transpire with wild magick and sufficient melee action.The series is pro-pagan; therefore those of a highly inflexible religious background or intolerant attitude towards religion might want to avoid the selection.Thank you."
3,More poetic than well crafted.,"Review by Scott Sammons, Christina's husband using her account.The language choice that the author made, was off-putting to me. I can enjoy poetic prose but this work was more work to read than I enjoyed. Some interesting ideas for the story and the characters were engaging. The book felt much longer than it really was due to the effort involved in reading it. The use of an ogre as a hero was fun and much of the story was entertaining. Some of the battle scenes were terribly repetitious, perhaps that is the nature of sword fighting.I will refer those who are interested in this book to try ""Trolls don't do Kung-fu"" instead."
3,Academic Theory Holds Strategic Insights,"Toward the end of this book, author Johannes Rüegg-Stürm reveals that the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland was once the site of a monastery. So perhaps it makes sense to wonder if a mood of monastic isolation explains the downside of the St. Gallen Management Model, which is that it sometimes seems cloistered safely away from the quotidian din of the business skirmishes outside its walls. Nevertheless, this well-written theoretical work presents a useful system of analyzing corporate structures, and Rüegg-Stürm illustrates his ideas with excellent and colorful charts. We believe that intellectually curious and imaginative CEOs may find concepts here that are relevant to their businesses, although since the book is highly theoretical, it may appeal primarily to those with a hearty appetite for the academic view."
2,Broke only after a few uses,"Really enjoyed the effects made by the petal, disappointed it broke only after a month of having it. Wish it would work."
2,Not what you'd think,This one is definitely not for beginners. It is far too detailed in terms of minute structure of the grasses and is not organized in such a way as to help the amateur in the identification of a particular grass type.
1,where are the stones?,"this item looks so much more beautiful in pictures. in reality, the stones are teeny-tiny and in a flimsy looking setting. moreover, the gems are lack-luster even when new, so i would expect the ""shine"" to be non-existent after only a few wearings. i returned this item as soon as i received it, so disappointed was i...its a pity because its my birthstone, but i guess you get what you pay for."
5,Beautiful Burst of Color,"Beautiful earrings-This is the fifth piece of blue topaz I've ordered from the Amazon.com Collection. Their collection of blue topaz is very, very good quality at a great price. These stones are clean, even under magnification, I sell jewelry, so I checked. The stones are a very bright diamond cut. Quality set, in 14k with a substantial post. It's solid, not reed thin, and flimsy. The butterfly backs fit securely(good friction). The color of the stones are like the Carribean Ocean glinting in sunlight. The size is about equal to a 1/2k diamond in each ear. When wearing, the setting nestles into your ear, so all you see is blue topaz. Even if you don't like mixing metals, you can wear these earrings with a necklace that is set in white or yellow gold, it won't matter, because all you will see is the stone. They are really lovely, very brillant and bright."
5,Simple and Beautiful,"These earrings were a gift for my mother. They arrived in a small ziploc bag, which was placed inside of a velvet bag, which was placed in a small gift box. The studs are small and simple, as expected from the description, but they are bright. Although the posts are 14k gold, my mother had no problem with them being too soft. Great purchase, highly recommended."
3,A brief review,"1. Nearly ever major religion has had some sects that practiced vegetarianism in some form. If you want a lot of details about that, this book has them. Some of the coverage of early vegetarianism, particularly ancient Egyptian vegetarianism, seems excessively speculative.2. The vegetarian food of 1700-1800s Britain sounds awfully bad and seems to consist almost solely of starches and sugary dishes.3. The world, or at least the US and Britain, appears to have been having the same arguments about vegetarianism for about 250 years.4. Post 1700, the book centers on Britain.I would have preferred more culinary history (for example on the origins of seitan and tofu) and fewer statements of the author's opinions (such as that, for example, a certain writer argues well), but the book is a useful reference of famous vegetarians and vegetarian sympathizers over the last 2500 years. Also, the sections that briefly discuss animal trials and pre-industrial slaughter methods are fascinating."
4,Must read,Recommended for serious christian readers. I use it daily and its very inspirational for the born-again christian interested in the writings of the great men of God.
3,interesting,"I liked this book to an extent. The robbery/murder didn't sway me in any way and I guess I never felt the terror the author was trying to conjure up. Then, my second problem is my belief that usually people involved in a crime don't want to see one another again or be reminded of the crime in any way. So, why would these 3 women who really don't have much in common become friends? While you could figure out what would happen when each woman stated what her dreams and regret's were, I do feel that the story in general was entertaining and worth reading. While there were too many characters in this book, it did have a great ending. I would say this is a good book to read on vacation or at the beach."
3,develop the art of skimming....,"I was hoping for so much more from this book. The three major protagonists are likeable and although wealthier than the average reader will be, easy to identify with. That said, the solutions to their problems are all too superficial. For example,we have one more over-weight woman losing weight and turning her life around. But my major disappointments are two: there are far too many pages that are just plain dull and unnecessary to plot or character development [filler?] that I just skipped after a while. And the major change in Kip's life seems contrived [I won't say more to avoid ruining the book for someone else]. I managed to finish the book by skimming, but this is my last Cynthia Victor book."
5,Action Adventure,"This was one of the best novels that I have ever read. It's action packed, a thriller that I couldn't put down."
5,Steamy Love Story with Lots of Suspense,I highly recommend A Moment in Time. If you enjoy readingmurder-mystery-romances then this is the novel that's been calling your name. This book kept me up all night. I couldn't put it aside until I finished it. I am anxious for her next book to come out. ... I definitely give this book two thumbs up!
4,Powerful choral music - stirring and exotic,"I don't have much experience with choral music, especially not with Bulgarian choral ensembles, but ""Sezoni"" is amazing. The chorus swells powerfully over plucked strings and woodwinds, trading off with Mara for the lead, sprinkled with instrumental interludes.The best this uneducated listener can do to summarize ""Sezoni"" would be a folksy Carmina Burana - folksy without being hokey, folksy with all the power and vigor of the best traditional music, but without the Western operatic pretenses.An interesting listen."
4,Interesting,"It is kinda boring but at the same time entertaining. The story just follows the life of the boy which is somewhat predictable by about 1/4 of the way through the movie. There are some funny parts and sad parts and a lot of parts to relate to, but still just a story about a boy. I suspect I would have like the book more as the story itself reminds me a lot of the book ""Running with Scissors"". I loved that book but found the movie to be a lot like this, entertaining but not even close to being as good as the book."
3,Suffering with little success,"As usual, the book is better, and as usual film-makers wallow in the tawdry rendering the movie more painful, and stripping the author's intent with distractions that do not further the plot. I recommend reading the book OR seeing the movie, side by side they are so disparate in intent as to create discord in the viewer's mind. Angela's Ashes is a story of hardship and survival, but the film is a too superficial treatment of poverty and a vast exploration of misery without relief. I was so glad when it was finally over. Not a good recommendation for a film. I would not sit through it again."
4,Pleasant discovery,"I purchased this book because of a French film version of the story. The two differ in some respects, but it is a touching story, and it illuminates an aspect of war on a human, individual level."
1,I've seen infomercials that generated more heat.,"Forbidden Games is a perfect example of a softcore film where you wonder what the point of making the thing ever was. The story is as boring and unoriginal as you can get. The acting is not anything to get excited about. The best thing I can say about the cinematography and sound editing is that there aren't any instances of glaring incompetance.But it's softcore, and all that stuff isn't supposed to matter, because we're all watching it for the great sex scenes. Right? But there are no great sex scenes! Sure it's got Amy Weber and some other attractive women, but what's the point if all they do is briefly pose for the camera and the ""sex"" could be more accurately described as ""naked people hugging and kissing each other"".This thing was made in 1995, when people were starting to figure out how softcore movies should really be done. This is not one of the movies that they figured it out with.Not recommended."
1,beyond the steppes,"I had the same experience as the first reviewer. watched about 20 minutes, looked like a good movie, case said English subtitles, could never find any. Very frustating."
3,bad art,"while the deck is easy to read, and does speck to some people, i felt the artwork was poorly done. There was no real flow between the cards. The cards were too wide and hard to handle. I'd would look at a deck first hand before you buy."
2,Disappointing,This deck is a sloppy mixture of different styles of images accompanied by a shallow booklet. Some of the cards are beautiful but most aren't. The product concept is good but either Doreen or her publisher got in a hurry and the result isn't too good. I've noticed that Hayhouse puts a lot of care on the outside looks of their decks but the inside is sloppy and disappointing.
2,VERY CONFUSING,I just read all of these reviews. I wish I felt the same way.They are confusing. Too Vague. The friends that I have shared these cards with also feel the same. The pics are beautiful. But my goal wasn't to look at nice pics of angels.I felt [disappointed].
3,"Use Personally, Not Professionally.","Like many others, I find the artwork breathtaking and the positive energy invested in this deck up-lifting. But the bottom line is it just does not give specific information. I am comfortable using this as a daily guidance or meditation aid oracle. But try asking it what you need to know about your up-coming job interview and the deck basically says 'think positive and something good will happen at some point"". Not very helpful for most of my clients."
4,Gorgeous Deck,"The Healing With The Angels Oracle Cards is a gorgeous deck of easy to read cards. With a word printed on each card that gives the basic meaning behind the card, it's a deck that even a beginner can pick up and start reading quickly. The fact that all the cards have positive meanings behind them fit the theme of the deck, and make it a great set for reading for people looking for a positive outlook. It does slightly limit the depth of the reading, somewhat, but there are definitely times when a reader has a need for the positive messages of this deck."
5,angel cards,Cards were in excellent condition. I start a class next week on how to use the oracle cards to talk to my angels. Can't wait to get started.
5,Love These Angel Cards!,I've purchased several of these cards and they make great gifts.I highly recommend them. A GREAT way to start your day.
5,One of the Best,"I am always careful of gimmicks and slickly produced items of this type, but I'm pleased to say these cards have proven otherwise. I have used these cards with great satisfaction and results. They are beautifully illustrated and each message is rich and varied. Ususally when I turn to these cards I am in great need and they always seem to provide the right message. I like that the author has succeeded in conveying gentleness, kindness, and infinite compassion through these cards"
5,I use these frequently,"Dorene's angel cards are my go to card deck when doing readings for people. I love the pictures. They're so beautiful, and very easy to use. One of the best purchases I've ever made."
5,Angelic Angel Cards,"Doreen Virtue's Angel Cards are wonderful, positive and uplifting. The ""positive"" view is not bogus, la-la, false happy-happy but offers thought provoking, sensitive insights on issues or questions asked. We all DO have angels. It's nice to have a spiritual tool that helps to reinforce this fact in a materialist oriented world that makes it hard to believe in or connect with spirit."
5,Healing with the angels oracle cards by Doreen Virtue,These cards are amazing.They are a must have for anyone who wants to truly communicate with their angels. Not only are they the most beautiful cards I have ever seen but they relay the most uplifting messages that are extremely accurate and full of love. Using these cards I have developed a strong relationship with Archangel Michael. As Doreen stresses our angels love us and these cards prove that.They are the best investment I have made.
5,Amazingly Accurate,"I was given these cards as a gift and I love them. They tend to draw me to them when I have an issue in my life. When I pick a card, it answers my questions. Amazing!"
4,Healing With The Angels Oracle Cards (Large Card Decks),These cards are nice and large and easy to read. I hope to use them more often. Very well illustrated.
1,save your money,"i was very disappointed with these cards.since the cover illustration of the cards themselves are angel wings set right side up, it is only natural not to want to pick that "" blocked (up side down )card"" and keep picking until the wings are up.plusthey are confusing, vague & it's as if she just was looking for a way to make money. i don't think any angel in their right mind would guide her to come up with these. and of course there's info on how to buy posters of any card you may want to purchase.i e-mailed virture ( the author) at her website regarding my questions & concerns & never got a reply."
5,Truly A Gift,"These cards a truly a gift from the divine source of the Universe. I thank Doreen for her incredible ability to provide the world with such a wonderful and spiritual blessing. They have also helped me to gain insight, understanding, and guidance on my sacred path of life. The cards habve the incredible power to illuminate the route that I need to take in life rather than living the delusions of societal thinking. truly an inspiration and great tool for life. Thank You Doreen. Highly recommended if you genuinely desire to follow the destined journey of your soul."
4,Healing With The Angels Oracle Cards (Large Card Decks),The cards are very sturdy. I have a little trouble shuffling them because they are so large. Everything is explained in the little booklet that comes with the card deck.
1,Crappy Seller,"The product itself is fine. However, I paid for expedited shipping when I ordered it on a Tues because i needed it by Sat. I was concerned and tried to contact the seller to see when it would be sent. For 3 days I got NO RESPONSE. Then on Sat morning, I sent an email asking if it had been shipped yet. They responded on Sat that it was shipped on Sat and that I could no longer cancel or get my money back. It finally showed up 8 days later - for expedited shipping. If you use this seller don't pay for expedited shipping unless you just like wasting your money. I feel sure I would have gotten it in about the same amount of time without paying DOUBLE for fast shipping."
3,Good explaining of the structures of everyday performances,"Good presentation of the settings around presentation and staged performances. It never goes into any tedious details, but focus more on the aspect of ""teams"" and ""stages"", much like what can be found in theatres. [Opinion] Everyone ought to make themselves conscious of these structures."
2,Sociology Book for Grad Class,"I had to read this for a graduate level theory class and had difficulty getting through it. I suppose it was the style of writing used then, not to mention I found it redundant in content. I highly suggest going with Asylum instead."
5,This really helps!,"My husband uses prescription strength Antiperspirant Old Spice but it would leave a nasty stiff white residue on all his shirts! I had to buy Deo-Go to get the stuff off. I was worried about his daily exposure to the chemicals, but nothing else would keep him odor free. Plus his neck would smell all mildewy in the morning from sweating all night in his sleep. So, I found this and bought it in March 2012. After his shower, he sprays this on his neck and his underarms (which I made him shave). Then he applies regular deodorant (not antiperspirant) on, and OMG, he doesn't stink AND I don't have extra laundry work to do! hahaha. I waited 3 months to write this to be sure it's working."
3,better than expected,"I have been looking for an odor free deodorant and one that would last a full day. I was worried when I saw the ingredients, mineral salts and purified water. How can that work, sez me. Well it does work. It works well.Revision:After a week or so the sprayer head completely clumped up, wouldn't spray."
3,Liquid Spray,The spray didn't work as well as the crystal deodorant push up stick. I didn't care that the liquid runs when you spray it.
5,Long lasting BO protection!,"This stuff is really effective and long lasting!My boyfriend started using this soon after I did, and he had some pretty awful 'pits. He works in a bakery, which is very labor intensive while working in a hot environment... so he works up quite a sweat. Even after working a long shift, there's no hint of stinky armpit smell. I'm not afraid to hug him after he comes home!"
5,Great Product,Liquad Spray Deodrant works for me. It can be hard to find a deodorant that works without all the chemicals. This works great for me with just a few squirts. Will buy again.
1,10 days only!,"The mist provided all day protection for the first 10 days. Afterwards, it only worked for approximately 4 hours."
4,thai crystal deoderant,"this is the best deoderant i know, but one of the two bottles i got had a faulty pump sprayer, so buy two to get a chance of actually using them -- i am disappointed in the faulty sprayer, of course"
4,Stable,I installed this board about 3 weeks ago. I was running XP on it until I got my Vista this week. I haven't had any problems with it. BIOS is easy to tweak and it overclocks wonderfully. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't support firewire.
3,Over Priced,"P5B is overpriced as it lakes dual LAN, Firewire and internal RAID (it supports RAID 0 & 1 via one internal and external SATA disk), BIOS needs to be updated in order to support Intel Quad Core. It may worth to review these motherboards first (Asus P5KC, Intel DP35DP, Asus P5KE/WIFIAP)"
2,Noisy,"There was a lot of noise on several of the songs. Physical disc looks ok, so must be the manufacture."
3,not so good meat grinder,the meat grinder gets clogged with fat often and needs to be cleared to continue. also the metal on the center pin wears adding silver colered contaminents to the meat. very bad item.
4,It's good but you need to be careful,"As I saw some pictures with a crack at the meat grinder, I cut the meat in small pieces before put it into the grinder, and it works ok, it takes a while to grind 1 pound of meat though.The sausage stuffer works really well and it's quite fast, in this case I cut the meat in really tiny pieces(I saw some recipes where you can grind the meat too) and it went throw really well."
3,Wouldn't recommend,"Doesn't work great with meat. Even when almost frozen like they suggest got it to make saussage , what a joke"
1,sausage stuffer,This thing is and was a complete waste of money.I should have listened to the other reviews.Spend the little extra money and buy a piston style stuffer.
4,Half of this is great,"The opening Rockin' in Rhythm is just brilliant. The closing bonus ""Don't Mean a Thing"", at ten minutes plus, is just as brilliant. Lots of good stuff between, such as Black & Tan Fantasy, Honeysuckle Rose (with the brass playing Scrapple from the Apple behind Jimmy Hamilton's clarinet solo), and Flying Home (in which the entire band plays the Illinois Jacquet solo). Some of this is so good that I consider it essential."
3,"a good album to buy if you like ellinton; otherwise, don't.","This album is OK, but it's not Ellington and company at their best. This album would be a great addition to a someone's collection of ellington. If you have never bought an ellington album though, i would suggest something from the band of the 60's instead."
5,Great stuff!,"I agree with the other reviewers here - this album contains most of the Bangles' best songs. With each successive album, the Bangles got a little more overproduced, through ""Everything,"" which is still good, but quite a few steps down from this one."
3,Decent Debut but Overated,"All of the reviews for this album seem to say the exactly the same thing: That ""All Over the Place"" is the Bangles best album, presumably before they ""sold out"". Well, that's just plain wrong. The Bangles, not unlike their namesakes, The Beatles, evolved. They got better with each successive album. ""Different Light"" was a vast improvement on this, their debut, and ""Everything"" topped them both. This evolution continues to this day. ""Doll Revolution"" is better than all three of the 80's albums combined.The Bangles are one of my all-time favorite groups. I loved seeing Susanna Hoffs on the Tonight Show with Joan Rivers. Joan asked Susanna what her musical influences were. Susanna had the all-time greatest answer! She said: ""The Three B's. Beatles, Byrds, and Buffalo Springfield!"" GREAT ANSWER! Joan seemed completely baffled! I think Joan had heard of the Beatles but you could tell she had no idea who the other two groups were!Funny."
2,disapointment,"At one point Trzoniec says you should start with a train set.Then,he recomends ''o '' gauge over 027 for a small layout,and tells us to buy all new trains,in o gauge. Then we are told to only set up our train set at Christmas!! The old MDK book is MUCH better."
3,Interesting But Wordy,"The Seven Secrets are thought provoking, but the Brooks sisters take 274 pages to say what could have been said in 100 pages. Also, the chapters veer off topic and spend considerable time discussing unfair treatment of women in the workplace."
4,Great recap of a few key Hulk adventures,"This book does *not* reprint the first 6 Hulks -- I have it, and it covers the first 3 parts of Hulk #1 (with the Hulk recolored green rather than his original gray), then jumps forward to two more contemporary (for the time) Hulk tales -- Roy Thomas' and Herb Trimpe's Hulk clash with the Absorbing Man from HULK #125, then Roger Stern & Sal Buscema's trip inside the Hulk's mind from HULK #227. Along with text passages in between. Makes a great read if you can find it."
4,One of the best vampire movies ever,this is one of my all time favorites. Chris Sarandon and the whole cast played their parts beautifully! I've seen every vampire movie made since the 70's and this one is top 5.
5,Sterling DVD Transfer. A Must-Have Vampire Film !,"Who would've thought that Roddy McDowall & Chris Sarandon would give two of the best performances in horror history? They most certainly do. There's no shortage of suspense, action and unrelenting horror in ""Fright Night."" Let's not forget carefully time-released comedy, either. This DVD was just screaming for commentaries. At this low price, we'll settle for the spooky trailer and awesome digital film transfer, which still looks great on 16:9 widescreen sets. A must-have, turn out the lights, pop some popcorn screamfest!"
2,Fright Night (1985) Bluray,"I wouldn't sweat that 'Limited to 3,000 copies' Twilight Time version of FRIGHT NIGHT(1985), especially since it's not an official release and I've known for quite some time that a commentary with the director(Tom Holland) and actor(William Ragsdale) exist for the eventual Bluray disc paring + more Extras. This is a just a ""bare bones"" disc with nothing special save the transfer of the film itself. The high pricetag folks are paying for this version is ridiculous and ill advised. Save your $$ for the legit version."
3,fright night,The movie was in good condition. Fright Night one of those movies that you look at when you want to be scared and laugh during the movie.
4,Ah..the 80s horror-comedy and Chris Sarandon is the BEST.,"Like a lot of others who have posted a review, I first saw this film when I was kid. I've seen it probably about 70 times since. It's one of those great films that makes you laugh, your skin crawl and screams to have the lines recited along with it.Another thing, IMHO, Chris Sarandon's vampire - Jerry Dandridge - has got to be the most sexy, sensual, menacing one in the history of film. From 'Nosferatu' all the way to Omar Epps, Sarandon is *still* my favorite vampire in cinema and that is saying a lot!The writer/director Tom Holland also wrote one of the most unintentionally hilarious films, ""Scream for Help"". It's so cheesy-bad it hurts!"
5,Awesome,Like many of the other reviewers I loved this movie when I was a kid I had my own copy and just watched it to death. It is about a vampire who moves in next door to Charlie a local teen who loves horror movies. He witnesse a vampire murder and then the mayhem begins. My favorite scenes are the pencil through the hand scene and the final showdown where Peter Vincent finally has faith. Go see this movie.
3,A very fun piece of 80's schlock,"Surprisingly clever 80s vampire horror/comedy featuring Amanda Bearse (""Married with Children""'s Marcy) & William Ragsdale (""Herman's Head""). Good special effects, LOTS of unadvertised language & subtitle tracks on this one. (audio: English / French / Portugese) (subtitles: English / French / Spanish / Portugese / Chinese / Korean / Thai)"
3,"Great movie, average DVD","I have seen Fright night at least 10 times. Twice in the theatres back in 1985 and numerous times on cable and LD. When the DVD came out, I bought it and rather disappointed because the sound is not in 5.1 Dolby Digital and the picture quality is just slightly better than the LD. But it is a great vampire movie. The storyline is about a teenager witnessed a murder next door which he believes done by a vampire. Of course nobody else believes him. It is fun, funny and scary. If only someone release the sequel on DVD also. The sequel is very much an equal to the original which is rare this days."
3,"Classic vampire film on Blu-ray, but missing extras.","Fright Night is one of the better vampire films from the 80's. The special effects are gruesome and scary yet the movie is also sexy and fun too. Yes it's from the 80's and it shows in a few places, but the movie still holds up very well today. This movie was released in limited edition Blue-ray back in 2011. The picture and sound of this edition look great. The only thing keeping me from giving this edition 5 stars is the lack of extras. They should have put a little more effort into this edition. Audio commentary, deleted scenes, and retrospective interviews with the cast and film makers would have been nice."
5,"It's an all time classic, great cast too!!",I just wish they paired it with Part 2. I really would like to get my hands on that. Didn't get that for Christmas this year.
4,its got Sam Ritter who is a um...,"...gay porn star. That's right, the actor who played evil ed, steve geoffreys has this pseudoynm Sam Ritter who did gay porn througout the 90's. In fact, this movie also contains lesbian Amanda Bearse and Roddy McDowall who, I guess is also gay. This movie even contains a homosexual or at the very least bisexual reference to the vampire and his assistant. But to me, thats what makes this movie so notable. A lot of speculation exist that makes a pretty reasonable connection between the considerable flamboyance of horror and homosexuality. This movie is cool because instead of denying that, it embraces it and actually creates a pretty cool atmosphere from it."
2,Pretty Midless................even for horror - Comedy,"I love horror movies. I love black Comady, but ""Fight Night"" had very annoying character's in it. Their's a big difference between funny and annyoing, but not the case of ""Fright Night"". The Vampire in ""Fright Night"" is [bad] when he trys to be funny and very laughable when he trys be scary. I am suprised on how much of a hit ""Fight Night"" actully became.I still suggest you rent this before you buy."
4,GOOD MOVIE BUT SELLER NOT TRUTHFUL,"THE PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD. THE MOVIE ITSELF IS PRETTY GOOD CONSIDERING, THOUGH IT'S NO EXORCIST. I AM UPSET ABOUT THE FORMAT. THE ONLY REASON I GOT THIS IS BECAUSE IT STATED IT WAS IN FULL SCREEN AND WIDE SCREEN FORMAT. IT ENDED UP BEING ONLY WIDE SCREEN FORMAT. I WANTED A FULL SCREEN FORMAT. I DON'T LIKE WIDE SCREEN FORMAT. OTHER THAN THE QUALITY OF THE MOVIE AND THE MOVIE ITSELF, I'M UNHAPPY WITH THE TRANSACTION."
1,Fright Night,Yes I was excited to purchase this item as I had experienced a difficult time finding this in commercial rental options. This WOULD have been a great find...only IT WAS ONLY PLAYABLE IN SOUTH AFRICA!!! Nothing on the purchase site told me this and alternate options when put into a PC to sync gave me the UK...I live in the US...Thanks Amazon
4,Fright Night DVD Mistake,"Just thought I would let those of you who are interested in buying this DVD know that it states that this DVD has both Widescreen 2.35:1 and Full Screen Presentations...NOT! Even though the discs say Widescreen on Side A and Fullscreen on Side B, BOTH sides are WIDESCREEN 2.35:1! The cover is also a lot darker than the one pictured. DVD has NO special features, and NO bonus material, other than the trailer of the movie."
3,"""Welcome to Fright Night...........for real!""","First of all, I LOVED this movie as a kid.........and I still do. I gave the DVD edition 3 stars because I felt that soo much more could have been done for this movie. There should have been commentaries, deleted scenes, bloopers........any extra footage to help boost this edition. This is such an awesome movie. I've seen DVDs for movies that were far worse...but had better DVD packages(like Vamp....and I love it just the same!) Other than that.........the transfer to DVD looks great.......even though it is dated!!!"
4,COOL MOVIE.,"THIS WAS A NEAT MOVIE. I LIKED IT VERY MUCH. GOOD ACTING, AND AMAZING EFFECTS.NOW FOR THE DVD. THE TRAILER IS A NICE ADDITION. ALTHOUGH I WISH THERE WERE MORE SPECIAL FEATURES FOR THIS GEM.BUT I DO HAVE ONE NEGATIVE CRITISISM. BEING A CHRISTIAN, THE NUDITY SCENE WAS NOT TO MY LIKING, BUT IT WAS AN ALL-AROUND GOOD MOVIE."
5,fright night,i remember watching this on vhs when my aunt had it. loved it! Chris Sarandon was so sexy playing the vampire. i never knew there was a part 2 to this movie but why is the dvd sixty dollars. guess i have to buy the vhs since its alot cheaper.
4,Fright Done Right,"An 80's ""classic,"" FRIGHT NIGHT is a straightforward (and yet tongue-in-cheek) vampire film that doesn't have any real surprises, but which never fails to entertain. Chris Sarandon mugs it up as the bloodsucker who moves next door, and our teen leads are suitably cute and pathetic as they run around trying to enlist the aid of skeptical cops and the narrator of a nightly horror show called, of course, FRIGHT NIGHT.There are a few things you might cringe at. I found the spikey-haired friend (Ebo? Is that what they kept calling him?) to be shrill and annoying. And the cheesy 80's dance scene went on two verses too long, but overall I was impressed by the special effects, the dedication to detail, and the fact that the movie never tried to be anything other than a good, old fashioned, fang-flick."
4,ok for it's time,Have seen this movie before purchasing and always enjoyed it.The make-up and special effects were good for it's time.
4,Guilty Pleasure,"This little flick has been one of my guilty pleasures ever since childhood. It is not the greatest movie ever made, but it does deliver on its promise to scare, titillate, and tickle. Add this 80's classic to the list of really fun B-movies: Flash Gordon, Lost Boys, Buckaroo Bonzai, Vamp, Easy Money, American Werewolf in London, Motel Hell . . . ah, those were the days. Rather than repeat what many viewers have already said, I'll just give you my favorite scene: Evil Ed, Pencil in the Head."
3,Cheesy Vampire Movie a Classic!,"I love this movie! The darkened scenes, the innocent virgin and the hokey out-of-work vampire slayer make up a movie that will entertain through the decades to come. Chris Sarandon plays a devastatingly sexy yet non-compassionate vampire, determined to punish the naive next door neighbor, Bill Ragsdale, the hottie from Herman's Head, for spying on his nighttime habits. The 80s music and disco sequence, along with the antediluvian costumes, go a long way to making this movie enjoyable both for the thrill of the hunt and the inevitable reminiscence of the decade in which it was made. Although it conforms to a specific 80s pattern, it has held up through time. Enjoy!"
5,Watch this movie in the dark!,"I first saw this movie at the tender age of five(!) and this has been one of my all time favorite vampire movies of all time. The recently deceased Roddy Mcdowall and the greatly underrated Chris Sarandon are excellent in their roles. They should have won an oscar! The story is simple: Young teenage boy thinks next door neighbor is a vampire. Then the boy enlists the help of a local T.V. and all hell breaks loose. This is a roller coaster ride from start to finish, so hold on and enjoy the ride!"
5,Awesome Movie!,"Fright Night is one of the best vampire flicks of all time - great cast and crew, good soundtrack and one memorable performance from the late, great Roddy McDowall! Chris Sarandon's portrayal of a vampire that enjoys himself (and munching on some great looking women) is not to be missed. The only thing that makes this great movie even better is the fact that it has been released on blu-ray!"
4,"Young Love, Teen Angst and a New Vampire on the Block","Released in '85 `Fright Night' is a wonderfully campy, contemporary vampire tale that was one of the first films to bring the vampire mythos into contemporary times, preceding the classic `The Lost Boys' by two years. `Fright Night' is a bit uneven in the beginning but during the last thirty minutes or so the storyline really comes together and make it all worthwhile. Chris Sarandon makes a great vampire as is Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent, late night host of Fright Night, a weekly television show where he masquerades as a fearless vampire hunter.This one is lots of fun and stands up well to repeat viewings!"
3,"So 80s, So Good...and Chris Sarandon","Really good, campy, scary, funny vampire fun. I love vampire movies and this is one of my favorite of the genre. Pre-CGI effects are good, especially Evil Ed's death. But the real reason I come back to this movie year after year is Chris Sarandon's vampire: What. A. Sexpot. Even the gay 80s clothes and Cosby-esque sweaters could not take away from his deliciousness. He is in almost no other movies, so I watch this one at least once a year. This vampire is smokin hot right down to his great, evocative voice. Bite me, I'm yours, baby."
1,Be Aware of DVD Regions,"Unfortunately, I did not realize that this DVD was for a European region. This was often an issue for old VHS tapes, but we forget the same issue arises with DVD's. I just threw the DVD away since I have no use for it - cannot be read by my DVD player.By the way, the movie is awesome. Always an old favorite of mine!"
3,Fright Night,"Horror movies are not really my thing, but this movie kept my attention and was pretty entertaining for the most part. Of course it's an older movie so don't expect a lot of special effects or anything. I like older movies (by older I mean 1980's), but if you don't happen to like older movies then maybe this wouldn't be a good choice for you. I personally remember being scared out of my mind from some other 1980's movies like Friday the 13th and especially Nightmare on Elm Street, but for some reason this one wasn't like that for me. So, overall it was pretty entertaining, but, not that scary."
5,One of the best...period...,"Fright Night 1985 is one of a kind, period. Remake or not, which Ive seen...although not bad, still doesn't have the charm the original has. Chris Sarandon as jerry is the perfect person for the role, plus it has the whole 80's feel to it, which of coarse is the best decade for horror..."
1,Waste of money,I CANNOT believe I paid... for this book. I was looking for a book of photos of all the rides at WDW and this one had an average one photo PER PARK. Just horrible.
2,Cute but not made very well.,I thought this was cute and would be functional for my daughter to use at daycare. I knew it was going to be thin but the bottom is made poorly as well. I was not happy that the pillow part is not machine washable; it is spot clean only. When I got it I washed the bottom portion before she would use it and it already has a tear. I thought for the price I was getting a decent deal. Most places that sell sleep mats are much higher but now I wish I would have paid the extra money to have something made better.
4,so sweet,We loved this item. Very colorful an cute. The pillow velcros to the blanket so no slipping away. The pillow does only have the shaped side on 1 side not 2 as shown in the pics. I did sw the seller & they were willing to take the return even thugh i used it but my daughter loved it so much we kept it. Still use it in the summer to lay on instead of in.
5,This is GREAT for severely dry eyes!,"My optometrist recommended Genteal Gel, and I find it is hugely helpful. It is less messy than Celluvisc (what I used previously) and doesn't sting in the eye like that product did. I find it easy to use and effective! Highly recommend it."
5,My Eye's Love It.,"Best thing I have found for my extra sever dry eye problem.. It would of course be just as wonderful on lightly dry eye problems,or even to refresh normal eyes. Great in cold weather too."
2,Scratchy.,"Slick and sumptuous club music. Unfortunately, this seems to be a transfer from vinyl, and the mastering engineer did not bother to fix the numerous scratches, pops, and static noise. The music is great, but is spoiled by a poor CD transfer."
3,Delightful music!,"This little play was reprised at Goodspeed Opera House in Connecticut in 2002. The music was incredibly well arranged and presented.Unfortunately, the only recorded version is this original cast Broadway album, which lacks the orchestration of the Goodspeed revival. However the music is still irrestible, and highly recommended.Too bad the play wasn't more of a success in New York, which would have allowed a more rich original cast album."
4,Interesting collector's item,"This isn't exactly a C.D everyone would jump at, when faced with the opportunity to buy it. But this is a must for the more experienced musical theatre buff. The score is at times haunting and full of melody. But there are a couple of occasions where you cringe at the twangy sound of one or two songs. DE JA VU is delightful and the main theme is lovely. Once you know the plot and hear the songs, it is guaranteed that you'll be deeply moved. Go ahead and buy it."
5,Excellent guide!,This is an excellent guide for psychotherapy with gay and lesbian clients!This book provides thoughtful case studies suggesting possible interventions for positive identity development within a gay-friendly therapeutic environment.
1,pleas be careful,"I bought this watch a month and one week ago for my gf. We went to the beach yesterday and since the watch is water resistant, she kept it on while swimming. After we cleaned up, she noticed a yellow patch on her wrist where the watch was on earlier. We noticed that the watch stop working and it was rusting from the inside out, leaving a rust spot on her skin. I took some pictures as proof and will be calling seiko customer service for a replacement because amazon will not do anything past the 30 day mark. Im highly disappointed with both the watch and amazon for fullfilling such product. We all know seiko is a well known brand that is tough and well built. There is obviously something wrong with the product i received."
2,This watch is so so...,"I bought this watch for my wife birthday. It looked very nice on the picture and when the watched arrived it looked quite different, very flat and simple. I did not impressed both of us and I have to return. Otherwise seller shipped on time and credit happend really quick."
4,Love It,"I've been wearing this watch daily for 2 years and I still love it. Very sturdy, no scratches on the crystal which is amazing. The mother of pearl dial is gorgeous and the bezel diamonds have nice shine without being too flashy. The only downside is the date is so small it's pretty much useless. But since everything else I use has a date (cell, computer, etc) it's not an issue for me. I would buy this watch again."
4,nice watch,"I bought this watch as a birthday present to myself. I love the size and color of the face. It looks nice the casual and dress clothes. The only problem that I have with the watch is that I can't see the day, month, and whatever the other dial is?!@!? I didn't even set them because It really doesn't matter. All being said, I would recommend this watch."
1,"Not the Way, The Truth, The Light","This book, although it probably has a lot of truth, appears to have been written by a ""shill"".A shill is someone who works for the house in a casino that bets at a table in order to stimulatebusiness for the table and the house.The true path is found on a sebsite called ""family guardian, i.e. ""famguard.com.I know their site, I know other writings, and I know this book.The writer of this book leads people down a blind alley, towardsuch a maze of worthless, hopeless,impossible pathways, that the readerwill conclude that it is impossible to free oneself from the evil government.This is the hope and purpose of this book: to create in people a hopeless, helplessfeeling. On the other hand, famguard, creates the truth, the light.Morally speaking, I believe the author has done a disservice to the American People.If this review gets published I will be amazed."
2,In the Immortal Words of Elvis Costello . . .,"Writing about music is like dancing about architecture. This was the book that cured me of my belief that you have to finish reading any book you start. You leap at the first chance to escape the drunken bore at a party, right? Putting this book back on the shelf? Same thing."
2,Like a Rolling Stone,"Not enough here for a book but more like a long, long essay.This is silly and has no purpose. It's only rock and rollbut I like it would suffice."
1,sifting through verbal vomit unaware of the vomiter,"IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE ME VOMIT, but been there, done that. 40 years later and yesterday's wine..."
3,A really good magazine article that went undited.,"There are many interesting facts regarding the cultural and musical importance of this song and many good anectodes from the studio. However, the interesting parts could have made a decent magazine article (and have already) while the rest is quite rambling and bloated. Still, a decent enough book and if you don't know much about the song or its importance, not a waste of time."
1,What is this ****,"Personally, I think Marcus is trying to make up for his insulting review of Dylan's (admittedly somewhat unimpressive) ""Self Portrait"" album with this book.And if he is, he utterly failed, as he has created something far more unreadable than that album was not listenable.This book defines dreadful."
1,Where's That Zero Star Option When You Need It?,"I happen to believe that Bob Dylan is the most important American artistic voice of the last half century at least. I also happen to believe that Like a Rolling Stone is the best rock song ever. If one does not believe those two things, Greil Marcus' hyperbolic huffing of a book is not going to convince you. Only Dylan's work will do that. If, on the other hand, you do already agree, Marcus' hip pomposity is pointless. Is the man capable of writing a sentence without layered metaphors and with fewer than twenty-five words? By the evidence in Like a Rolling Stone, no. If you want to know what Dylan is and means, read his own Chronicles, not this."
1,A TERRIBLE Book,"Marcus loves lists. Give him the slightest pretext, and he's off making a list about something. Sadly, most of these lists don't pertain to Dylan or to the song in question here.Let me be clear: I'm a Dylan fan and have read several books about him. But this one is a complete waste of time. I suggest this: if you;re interested in it, go find a bookstore and spend 15 minutes reading it. If you are still interested, you'll probably like the rest of the book. But I'll predict you'll put it back on the shelf."
3,some chapters are good some are not,"This book I think it is a mixture of topics discussed by :Power System Analysisby John J. Grainger, William D. StevensonandPower system stability and controlby faud and andersonThis book doesnot attract me untill chapter 6 and go on ...it may be useful but still the two old books are more good....."
4,Simplemente genial,"Este album tiene lo mejor de las canciones de Manzanita de finales de los 70 y principios de los 80. Un buen trabajo recopilatorio con las archiconocidas Verde y Ramito de violetas. El toque genuinamente gitano de la personalidad de Manzanita, con su voz rasgada y auténtica. Un disco innovador, único."
1,"When you want a movie really bad, this is a really bad movie","Ignore the cover. Big Bill Smith's character is dead within the first ten minutes. Then it's straight downhill -- kinda like going from the frying pan. Don't say you haven't been warned. I threw this one straight into the ""round"" file."
2,works well til it needs recalibration,Worked very well until it suddenly started under reporting weight. I assume I will have to recalibrate it or buy a new one. It lasted just past the one year warranty.
1,Don't waste your money.,"The first one went bad in 1 month, luckily within Amazons return period. Amazon did it's usual great job in replacing it. The second one managed to last 11 months of very light use."
2,The Postal Scale,"when I first hooked up the scale it only registered in grams and kilos, not ounces and pounds. I emailed the company and they did not respond for 2 weeks. Very unprofessional to me. In the interim I figured it out and the scale works fine except that when standing for a while (plugged in) it will resister 1 or 2 ounces with nothing on it. I'm thinking of getting another one directly from the post office. Allan Palmer"
4,Pretty good reference book.,"We used this book almost daily during our recent trip to France and Holland. My only complaint is that it could use more indexes. It was often cumbersome to find something I had read before. I could have used a better index. Of course, I could have used stickies but I didn't have them."
2,Not the Greatest Travel Guide,I tried out this book and found it to be very vague. It tells some of the different types of travel but doesn't give you any specifics. It honestly isn't much help if you are actually planning to go to europe. It also mentions too few different ways that you can stay such as backpacking and such throughout all the different countries. It gave very little info on anything. Then at the end to take up space they rate and give short descriptions of damn near every restaurant in europe. Just to fill up space since this book was just about useless! If I were you I'd skip over this book and find another one that fits your needs the best.
5,Europe for dummies,This book really gives a great detail description of all the great places to visit in Europe. I would recommend this book to anyone who decides to travel around Europe.
1,Absolutely Horrible,This book is absolutely horrible. I bought this book for my third trip to Europe and it is utterly nerve-wracking and annoying to read and follow. It is very vague and doesn't help at all for planning a trip. Many times it bolds locations without giving any information about them. The restaurant recommendations are also completely useless. Most of the information in the book is just there to fill up pages. Search for another book or look online for places to visit and eat. This book actually made the weeks in Europe WORSE.
1,Nothing like I thought,The slide was nice looking but would not hold up a 9 and 11 year old boys who are anything but big for their age. I was surprised and thought it would be better made. I was very disappointed and in fact returned the slide.
2,mediocre,"The CD I received was not quite the same as the product description, which includes a collection of 50 songs. What I received instead was an extract (16 tracts or 1/3) of the original collection and the seller, I hope, might not have been aware of the huge gap between the two products."
1,"And so, to where has it all brought us ?","Over the course of her twenty-five year career in education ! ! ! What progress have we seen?Are we now reading better? Are we now doing better for the children than in the past when only the 'BASICS' were taught. Well, YES! If you don't count actually being able to read as a requisite part of the assesment.Does anyone in the education profession even consider the idea that with all of the 'programs' that have been instituted over the last 40 years, we have attained a LOWER literacy rate in this country?Look at the content of the 'Weekly Reader' and 'outh's Companion' of previous generations and explain why activities that were ENJOYED by Early Teens (who were taught only the 'basics') are for today's College Student tedious, seemingly irrelevant, and, frankly, beyond their comprehension."
5,Interesting and fascinating,"The detailed information, with dimensions and plans included, along with magnificent photography make it a must, both for reference and normal reading purposes."
2,This is not a Romance,"This book is misclassified as a romance. The two main characters fall in love and marry very early in the book. The plot of the book centers around American Indian peace negotiations. I became very bored reading the book and had to force myself to finish.The author of the book writes very touching romance novels, but this is not one of them. Pass this one up."
1,Way too much graphic sex,"I got this book for my kindle and had read others from this author before. I also thought she was a Christian author, it surprised me that there was graphic sex in the book. I never finished the book and would not recommend it."
2,Broke after minimal use,"I bought this keychain for my husband and he was so excited about it. I was a little irked that they didn't bother to do the engraving I had requested and sent us a blank one, but he didn't mind. However, the ring broke off the bottle opener a month after my husband put his keys on it! He only had a chance to open a couple beers before it broke and he hadn't dropped it or mishandled it in any other way, so this was not a case of over-use. A waste of money."
5,Brushed Key Chain Bottle Opener,"I bought this item in 2007 for a pal of mine. It's still on his keys today and gets almost daily use. Very sturdy, very worth it!!"
4,Gotta love Disciple,"What a great cd from a great band that just keeps getting better and better with time. Depending on which style of rock you like, this is a fun, loud album that has a great mix of heavy guitar riffs, smooth guitar solo's, and a few slow songs that were definitly written from the heart."
3,Worth Listening To,"Other reviewers have done a good job describing the lyrical content: absolutely straight out of the Bible. This is true.Musically, Disciple has a pretty good sound going. It really is heavy metal, not just a watered-down wannabe version. The lead singer, Kevin Young, is almost rapping a lot of the time, so if you dislike that it will get annoying after 19 tracks.The only other criticism I have is that while their songs are good they all sound pretty similar. However, if you like that musical archetype you'll probably enjoy this. In short, a fun album to play in the car."
5,Absolutely outstanding,"Tony is great in this latest edition. The crew has really grown together. They fit like a glove. Although I miss Sharona, Natalie really compliments Monk's peculiaralities to a tee. Captain Stottlemeyer and Lt. Disher have also grown in their roles. This is quality entertainment. Don't miss it, especially if you are a Monk fan. I could be wrong about all of this, but I don't think so."
3,A So-So Season,"Season 4 definitely wasn't the best Monk season. The first half was very good with great episodes like Monk Gets Drunk, Mr. And Mrs. Monk, and Monk Goes Home Again. The second half, however, was a load of garbage. The episodes are POORLY written. For example: in The Captain's Marriage episode when the Captain got a divorce, it confused me how they didn't mention it in any following episodes. This season probably features some of the worst Monk episodes like Monk Goes To The Dentist, The Big Reward, and Monk Goes To A Wedding. Anyway, this is good to get if you are a big fan of Monk."
2,Please! Please! Again Please bring Sharona back!!!,"My wife and I are huge Monk fans, Season 1-3 were great; but when Sharoana left the show so did the flavor. We still enjoy Monk and the original cast but Sharonas replacement just does not fit his character at all. I have seasons 1-3 and doubt I waste my money on season 4. I think I will switch to another show."
1,No spanish subtitles??? We're insulted.,"We're huge Monk fans, but how could they tear-out the Spanishsubtitles for Season 4? This is an outrage and an insult.We're two hugely disappointed fans. Tony, make it right, please."
2,Disappointing season,I enjoyed early seasons of Monk but this season lacks most of the original aspects that set this series apart from the other detective stories. I didn't think it was worth the purchase price.
5,Monk Season 4,"Monk keeps on getting better and better!! At first, I missed the Sharona character, but I've gotten to where I even prefer Natalie. The entire cast is great and I look forward to seeing Monk for years to come!"
5,Monk is the Best!!,I recently ordered Season Four of the USA series Monk from AstroVideo. I have purchased many TV shows on DVD from them in the past and knew that I could count on their reliability and good quality and fast service. I am thoroughly enjoying the episodes and couldn't be a happier customer.
5,Good series,This was purchased for a gift. Anyone that likes the Monk series will enjoy this series. Great product and packaging is nice.
5,Run and get this jewel!,"I have had this record for a couple of years and it knocks my socks off when I put it on. The level of professionalism in execution of the the songs and the quality of the production and recording is exceptional. This is not just for the flamenco listener or the fan of Federico Garcia Lorca's poetry and martyrdom, but for anyone who enjoys good music and whose taste is complex and well rounded. Enrique Morente is an absolute professional and the talent assembled for this album is made up of first rate musicians."
4,Nice art,This is a nice item and described accurately according to size. I recommend ordering a better chain or using one you already have because the one supplied with it is not very high quality.
5,Absolutely delicious!,I added this banana syrup to chocolate milk with a scoop of protein powder. It was SO good! Can't wait to try my coconut flavor :)
5,This music fills you with a joy not common in todays world.,The etherial sounds of Manuel Ponce's music transport the listener to a place that we would all love to call home. The harmonic language of this composer is not rivaled by any other before him or since his death.
2,Good in parts...,"I have played and loved Ponce's guitar music for many years and I always wanted to have a copy of the sonata for Guitar and Harpsichord (here in the form for Guitar and Piano). However, the guitar sounds so harsh and strained on the recording that it completely spoils the CD. If you want to hear this performed properly, have a listen to the more recent Naxos recording of Ponce's Guitar Music (vol 2). This is much better played and in the original harpsichord version which I find preferable. The other tracks on this CD are interesting, particularly the guitar duos which I'd never heard of - what a shame about the last three tracks!"
2,"Rings ok, but the cage!!!","The cage is made of a flimsy plastic and the pieces don't fit well together. Put in one side and the other three fall apart. The sides don't open as advertised and the trap doors won't stay close. My son is 7 and he hated the cage... it's dificult to play with any of the 7"" figures. We ended up taking the cage off and now the ring alone is really good, he loves it now. Just thought the price was way to high, would have been worth it if the cage actually worked as its supposed to."
1,Prodcut that is not worth the money,"I would not recommend this product, the cage is plastic and it breaks easy. It is not worth the money."
4,My 8yr old loves it!,"My 8yr old wanted this so badly for Xmas this year. Took a little skill to assemble correctly, but I like that it fairly easily comes apart for transportation (Bringing home from out of town Xmas) and he has a great time playing with it. Really likes all the features!!Little pricey, but what isn't these days? Also, I could not find it in any stores!! Thanks Amazon for hooking me up with a fairly decent deal right after Thanksgiving!! Better prices than now! Happy New Year!"
5,Nice one Rory let's have another one,"Just got the DVD after waiting 28 years. .... I went to see him for the first time in the Carlton Cinema, O'Connell st, Dublin in 74, so I have always associated this particular album with this time period. So, to finally see this on DVD, after all this time, threw me right back to my long-haired days. I know the quality could be better but it is '74 after all. If you are a real fan, you have to buy it, but there are no surprises cause you know he's the best. Same shirt, same unpretentious way, same old story ... deh deh deh deh, deh deh."
3,"Nice ,but disappointing","The live shots of the band in concert wasted too much footage on showing Rory's face and not enough film on his guitar playing. They should have at least filmed his whole body while he was playing. Hard to get into a groove with the film as you hear the guitar wailing and they did not show much of it. The plus side of the film was showing us his 'down to earth, not worried about a hit single approach'. If we had more artists like Rory the state of rock/blues would not be in the sorry state it finds itself in. Rory and Robin Trower are my two favorites."
3,Excellent concert for your collection,"First of all, I need to say that several reviews on here are critical of the sound quality. While I admit there isn't much bass, it still sounds decent. This was filmed in 1974, folks! Nobody knew it would make its way to a high-definition format that didn't even exist at that time! Personally, I think the sound matches the somewhat rough video and adds to the ""age"" of the experience.The concert itself is very good. It shows Rory in his earlier years, before he really became big. (Sadly, he never became as big/ popular as he deserved to become.) It is a great look back in time, and I'm sure you will watch it many times if you choose to buy it. I've had it a couple of weeks, and I have watched it 3 times already!"
3,Where's the bass/low end in this DVD?,"Although I love this documentary, I'm astounded by the lack of bass/ low end on the surround mix. My original vinyl album has more bass than this, or is it a flaw in this version of the disc ( I have the European version). Anyone else noticed this?"
2,The editing is terrible! Awesome gig though......,"I love Rory Gallagher. The picture quality is great, the sound is great, but the way in which the programme has been edited is frustrating.Every time the camera should include the guitar in shot all we see is Rorys face!As a musician this winds me up immensely. I want to see him play and see his brilliant technique. This is an awesome gig, only problem is you cant see it!1st class in all other respects, but for me the DVD gets only 2 stars.Surely I'm not the only person with this major gripe?"
5,RARE RORY,"I'm from the US and it is quite obvious from the UK-centered reviews that this dvd is held under greater scrutiny, probably because folks in britain were fortunate enough to be able to see this INCREDIBLE guitarist in his prime while, for whatever reason, Rory Gallagher remains in this country anyway, an afterthought when it comes to classic rock(?), and an unheared-of genius (much like Roy Buchanan). Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS DVD! If you have come this far in your couriosity about Rory Gallagher, then you have reached the point at which you CAN make up your mind! Rory Gallagher is AWSOME and you will not be able to deny this after watching this dvd. Yes the footage is dated, but the HEART (IRISH HEART) is there!"
2,rory gallagher irish tour 1974,"Rory Gallagher is a great musician. It's just only to bad that this dvd mostly focused it's attention on the band members faces while performing instead on showing the large picture,them actually playing their instruments.If you like Rory Gallagher's music as I do, do your self a favor and get his cd's or you can buy this dvd and listen to the music while you relax with your eyes closed."
2,New to Motion,"Being that I am new to motion this book was not an easy read. It actually does not give the novice a leg to stand on nor does it provide the detailed information needed to create the projects that you want. What it does do, however, is provide additional knowlege almost a part 3 of a 5 part series to motion. If you are new to motion I would suggest you look elsewhere for your instruction but if you are already familiar with motion and its intricacies then by all means put your money down. Even if I were well schooled in motion this still would not grace my shelves. The direction and applications that I have in mind for motion just does not correlate with the provided instruction."
1,Don't waste your money,I sent this with my daughter to college in August and by October the casing for the wire had frayed open. Great idea - poor quality.
3,Picture and Description misleading,Picture and Description misleading Only ONE toughsack. Good sack but wouldn't have ordered if I had known it was only one
4,Look awesome and fit great!,These look great on my 04 Jeep Grand Cherokee! 4 out of 5 stars only because the lock tight strips on the cover would have shown through at night when breaks lit up. If I hadn't moved them to a more discreet location prior to installation I would have been a little upset . Other than that minor set back theory look much better than having the lights tinted with paint.
2,"functional, but not stylish","The image of this item is a little deceiving; the trim on the bag is actually gray and the basic color is a darker silver than it appears here. The material is also flimsier, which is a drawback in terms of protection, though this does mean the sleeve isn't too bulky in a school bag. I also have to really cram my 13.3"" Macbook into the case, so while it fits nice and snug, it's a bit of a hassle every time I use my computer. If I wasn't so lazy, I'd return this product and look for one that was more attractive and protective."
3,"It says it's for Magellan, but...","I bought this item for mounting my Magellan Road Mate 3030 GPS to my motorcycle. It does not fit without modification. The adapter for the handlebar fits fine using one of the rubber pieces that came with it, but the adapter side that supposedly fits the GPS is very different than what is needed for this particular GPS. The ad did not mention about an additional adapter that could be needed.I ended up removing the part of the adapter that supposedly would fit the GPS and using half of the dash mounting adapter that came with the GPS. The pivoting ball on this adapter is slightly bigger than the one with the dash mounting adapter, so it cannot be tighten solidly. It is enough to sustain the motorcycle vibration-it won't fall-but it moves when pressing/touching the screen to navigate through the GPS menus.Overall, it is usable, but I wish it would fit better."
1,Horribly crude and depressing,"Watched it because a relative was in it. Read the review line ""cried out to be made into a movie"" and somehow interpreted that to be cried out loud (Because of what I thought was humor - 3 brothers and one girl right?) Well it may have been well acted but they were miserable lot of folks"
4,Authentic Pinter Adaptation,"A refreshingly nasty and rarely moving chamber drama with an improbable twist. Superlative performances.Though the cinematographer might beg to differ, nothing has been done to make this play film-like by opening it up. The ""action"" basically transpires in the confines of one large room.The Dvd transfer lacks sharpness, though on an analogue television it should appear more than satisfactory."
4,Information provided is well worth the price of the book!,"We suggest picking up this book before you plan on making a trip to Disneyland. The information proved to be very useful. We did not follow any of the plans in the guide, but made sure to hit up the attractions that were rated not to be missed. The information on how the Fastpass system works was very useful, and allowed us to see more of the park than we otherwise would have been able to. The book is a little sloppy. With all the revisions it is a bit confusing and may seem to have conflicting information. Also, the maps and tables are not easy to follow. Still the information provided is well worth the price of the book."
2,Surprisingly Dull,"Considering the subject of the book -- a roman a clef with easy to recognize lesbian stars from the theatre and movie worlds -- it is surprisingly boring. ""Valley of the Dolls,"" while hardly great literature, was a fun read. This was not."
5,Just what I was looking for!,I had to order a replacement for my clippers and this was just the piece I needed. Replaced it and my clippers are back to new!
3,Can't stop RAVEN...,"Ah, so good to see the Ultimate Metal Power Trio back at work. (No, not VENOM, they can only play an open E at 500 mph). ONE FOR ALL rocks appreciably, although possibly at slower speeds than the average RAVEN fan is used to. I was hoping to hear the deep, thundering production qualities of ALL FOR ONE, but this one is somehow lighter in tone. ""Seven Shades"" and ""Double Talk"" start off the CD at a crisp pace, but then the band slows down a bit...""Kangaroo"" is some damned good headbanging, reminiscent of ANVIL's ""Brain Burn"". Too bad the rest of the album doesn't have that pace. But still, an average RAVEN album is still better than 99% of all other metal albums. RAVEN IT UP!-KK"
2,Good times never come back...,"Ok, RAVEN thought this new album was so cool that they decided to name it in homage to their best album, 1983's ALL FOR ONE.But this is not true. ONE FOR ALL will do absolutely nothing for RAVEN to regain some respect again, the respect they lost when they completely sold out to Atlantic in 1985, releasing the turkeys STAY HARD and THE PACK IS BACK.ONE FOR ALL is no doubt better than the aforementioned records. It's raw and tough, but the inspiration just isn't there..."
4,about the DVDfilm/movie XX/XY,"The story is basically a group of tietiary student (1 men and two woman) having fun and get together and later after they came out to work during their working life and had their own boyfriend nver know that one of them meet back the man they met during their study/young days and later had sex with him to be accidentally caught by the man's girlfriend where later at the end of the film they live together after the rest of his lady friends with their boyfriends left the holiday rersort. Recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of film.XX/XYReview by:Dr, MR Franc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon Kahdirector 'lou ye'- Ang Poon Kah for film summer palace."
2,"Ruffalo does his Brando thing, while the film goes nowhere.","I really, really disliked Austin Chick's XX/XY. Though Mark Ruffalo is in it and again proves that he's very talented and capable of exuding this sort of mumbling burnout sensuality, I did not think most of the main characters, with the exception of the live-in girlfriend Claire who was introduced in the second half of the film, were at all well-developed. I thought the plot lacked direction, that the ending was an extreme let-down and that the entire film lacked a point.I left the theater annoyed, wishing that Ruffalo would find another vehicle for his talents like the wonderful YOU CAN COUNT ON ME."
1,Awful,"I thought this movie was absolutely awful.It is one of the worst movie's I have seen in quite a while.You keep waiting for the movie to get interesting, but it never does.I don't recommend this movie, especially not to a guy, he would be bored out of his mind by this one."
2,when being an independent film is just a moniker,"The movie starts out slow and explores the relationship of two people who seemingly love each other but make the other miserable. It then fast forwards to ten years later when the principles reunite and truly test their love and feelings for each other. The second half of the film is redeeming and really resonates at times. Overall, the film feels a bit too ""indy"" - as if it's trying too hard to not be mainstream and that's why it includes unconventional details."
3,Flawed but Good,"This movie contains three solid actors, and a good premise of a story, but the pacing is off. It becomes slow in some places, and a certain side of the main character is not explored enough in the flashback. The direction is great for an indie - interesting shots, and the muted colors are used well, but the storytelling can be just as muted at times. Mark Ruffalo continues to prove himself to be one of the best actors of his generation. His performance alone is reason enough to see it."
1,Y did they even make this movie,"I bought this movie becasue I'm a Mark Ruffalo fan. Needless to say I was disappointed, I don't now what the point of this movie was. Don''t waste your time."
2,"Rent it, don't buy it.","Though I wouldn't say that anyone's performance in this film was grossly lacking, the movie itself definitely was. Mark Ruffalo gave a somewhat convincing performance, but the storyline itself seemed to be missing something the whole way along. Never once did the movie have the sense of real passion or drama that it was hyped up to be. Kathleen Robertson's character Thea, seemed the only three-dimensional character, even though she was admittedly shallow.There is a scene about midway through the movie where a man recognizes Coles (Mark Ruffalo) on the street as being the director of a film. He tells Coles that he saw his movie... thoroughly disliked it, and wanted his money back. I found that whole scene amusing and ironic, as I would be likely to ask the same thing of the director of this movie.If you really want to see this movie, rent it, don't buy it. It's not one that is worth watching more than once... if at all."
3,Good but dated,"All of the Gazetteer atlas books are always great. I use these for planning scenic motorcycle trips on back roads. Since this edition is pretty dated, I'm concerned that the back roads wont be as accurate as I need them to be."
2,The old one was better,"The old Wisconsin Atlas and Gazetteer (before 2004) actually had better detail and fewer mistakes. The more I use this map, the less I like it. One feature the old version had was a grid showing every square mile in the state. This allowed a person to tell with much greater accuracy when your next turn was coming or the distance between places. This map does not have that. One feature I do like about this map is the slight overlap between pages on the edges of the map, but that is the ONLY thing better about the map. My husband and I have used and do use the Wisconsin Atlas on a very regular basis. Overall I am very dissatisfied with this map and would recommend the older version."
4,Wisconsin Atlas and Gazetteer by Delorme,"great price, took a really long time to get delivered via USPS. May consider spending the extra $5 or so to buy it at a local hardware store if you're in a hurry."
4,"A Very Clear and Uncluttered Atlas, but missing a few things","It is a very clear and uncluttered atlas, but I reserve a fifth star because of the info that is missing that I think would be beneficial to the overall quality of the atlas. One, this atlas has not been updated since 2002, and it is apparent that the map is missing some sections of highway reconstruction in Wisconsin that have changed the roads in the past 8 years. Two, not all of the Rustic Roads are labled. Lastly, and I think the most important, there is not a city location page throughout the entire atlas. I think at least a page or two of city locations would make up for the other inadequacies. All in all a -very good- backroad atlas, but not without its flaws!"
5,Includes everything wonderful about Wisconsin,"This gazeteer is very useful for planning outdoor trips...canoeing, camping, etc. It even includes wineries and seems to be very accurate so far."
4,That's Life,"Like many performers of that kind of music Ray Gelato is influenced with Louis Prima too! Some beautiful duets are performed with Claire Martin (british singer that recorded more than five albums). Songs are mostly covers with two exceptions ""Forget About Livin'"" (written by Ray Gelato) and ""Since You Moved in With Me"" (written by his trombonist Dave Keech). On sax you can hear fabulous Al Nicholls (The Big 6). Very good uptempo swing!"
1,this book is too big,You wouldn't like to have this book because it's too big. It's not like the small regular hand held books. It's like three times that size. And I don't mean it by the number of pages.
3,Nothing New Here,"Despite ""Fr. AChDAE's"" hilarious statement that this book reveals the AP techniques of the G:.D:. (which have been available for decades), and another poor soul who thinks the book is too large (?!?), this book is just another in a long line of clones. People definitely enjoy reading about it, but I wonder how many people reviewing this book can consciously project? THAT is the Test, and if you are serious about beginning the journey--get _Astral Dynamics_, by Robert Bruce. However, expect to _work_ for it."
3,this is the subject of this post,Look up astral projection on the web to get a good idea of what astral projection is before you read any books. I read this book and it's not very good as the others
5,Steps to getting closer to achieving OBE's,This tells the steps of how to mediatae special ways and from thier it leads into dreaming and to astral projecting or OBE's.
2,ok,"Astral projection (out-of-body experiences) is the most interesting and awsome subject known to man. You could leave your body by meditation. You could turn into a ghost and fly around the world, into every universe, every demintion of existance, view past and future lives, etc. Look up astral prjection on the world wide web. then buy this book. i dind't think it was very good, but you might."
5,"Small screen, but great product","i originally bought this for my daughter on her 4th bday in august. i was a little worried she wouldn't be able to work it, but just after a day or so she got it. i do wish the screen was bigger for what we paid. i just had to purchase another one becuase her 1 year old brother threw hers across the room and broke it. i guess now we'll have 2 sets of headphones :). the other would have lasted alot longer if my 1 year old hadn't broke it :(. luckily i found 1 really cheap...YEAAAA!!!!! there are other dvd players for the same price with a bigger screen, but they don't have Dora on it."
5,Great Comedy! Daphne Zuniga is beautiful and very perfect!,"A great comedy for all!A very good movie feature Jack Wagner, Daphne Zuniga and Zack Ward.The story is original and the movie is enough well made!Story:Kyle's a police officer, and his partner is his dog, Hunter. Hunter gets killed in the line of duty, and his spirit comes back in the body of a criminal named Howie. Howie, with the spirit of Hunter in him, helps Kyle in solving a dastardly plot. A police veterinarian, Amanda Morton (play by the actress Daphne Zuniga!!!!!!! from Melrose Place) will help Kyle and Howie for found the main guy...Daphne Zuniga and Jack Wagner play again together after ""Melrose Place"" and ""Artificial Lies""I recommend this movie.Great and good comedy!"
1,This book.....,"The LDS religion is a Christian religion, hence the actual name of the church: The Church of JESUS CHRIST of Latter Day Saints. ""Mormon"" is merely a nickname that this church is known for, but it should actually be called 'The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints"". The other people who left reviews on here about 'why mormonism is not christian' are completely wrong, and misinformed. If they were informed, they would absolutely know that people who go to the LDS church are Christians, and that Jesus Christ is the MAIN focus within the religion. All I have to say is read and learn more about each religion, before trying to make claims and statements that are simply untrue."
5,A baffeling move by the Chili Peppers,"I am a huge Peppers fan. californication (the newest album) ranks number 2 in my top 5 favorite albums (1 would be Nirvana's Nevermind). However, I am stunned as to why they put the best track on the album out as a single. It is a great song, and if you like, you MUST buy the album. For me it is the most emotionally evolking song on the album. And the latest single californication (also the album title) is my 2nd favorite track. So buy the single for the bonus video of ""otherside"" on it, and buy the album for the great music."
5,"I Hate Pop, But I Love This Song","I am sad that this amazing piece of musicianship has become a hit single. This, along with Scar Tissue from the Californication album are two great desert tunes. As you listen to this song, you may see visions of cruising along in the desert in a convertible around sunset. It comes with a great unreleased track, How Strong, which mixes funk with blues perfectly. It also comes with a video of Otherside, which in my opinion should be flip flopped with the great Scar Tissue video. If you're looking for something cheap to buy, get this, it'll be worth your pennies."
5,Beautiful Photos and Great Facts about Big Cats,"Seymour Simon's book ""Big Cats"" is wonderful introduction for children to the world of the big cats. Children will love the huge, full-colour photographs of these gorgeous felines as they learn about lions, leopards, tigers and more. Written in terms that the young can quickly comprehend, this book presents interesting insights into these cats of the wild and makes learning about these animals a delight."
1,My thoughts on Solaris,"I cannot say this is a bad move, because it is definitely has its points and part of the story is interesting and has an intelligent feel. Lots of surprises arise out of all those questions that come to mind.However, as I can see it, Solaris has one major drawback:It is simply not entertaining enough. Some more fast-paced action would be required for a higher grade.Still, I believe that Solaris is about the best work that can be made wihtout deviating from the book that it is based on.If you like mind-boggling slow psycho-thrilllers then this is the movie for you, otherwise stay away from it."
1,Waste of time,"I saw this movie with 5 other people in a crowded theater. Had I known that I couldn't get a refund after the first 20 mins of the movie start, I would have walked out like a few other people did. Even after the movie, we weren't the only people to ask for a refund. All of us were very frustrated that we wasted 2 hours of our time and almost a year later we still talk about getting that 2 hours back! I thought that perhaps the movie would get better, but it never did. It isn't as if I'm not familar w/abstract-artsy films, but this didn't even accomplish that. It's as if there are major chuncks left out of the story. Now I'll have to read the book for some continuity. All in all, it's one of the very few movies that I wish I never wasted time or money on and I've seen some pretty bad movies."
2,The screen is tearing in the bottom part.,"The screen is good for 6 months, now I see the bottom part where it meets the track is tearing because of the dorr being opened and closed. Other than that it works good. Hope they will put a nicer screen material next"
3,"Works good, but tricky to install","The instructions were a bit tricky to install in my doorway. I reread the instructions a few times before I figured out which way I had to install the frame for the screen door. I needed to put in a shim basically at the bottom for the bottom rail to attach to. i've seen other retractable frames in my neighbor's homes that fit inside the doorway that made them more hidden. All in all, works well."
2,Just another version but oh what a Hot! vampire,"A so-so version produced by Wes Craven with a slightly different lookat Dracula's origins. Somewhat campy version but not very scary. GerardButler is, however, mesmerizing as Dracula and very sexy and has a verycommanding presence in the role. One of those looks and I'd certainlybare my throat for him."
3,Gerard Butler as dracula is the only saving grace,"It's an okay dracula movie. Better than some, worse than others. Pretty much the same plot, but with a twist at the end. Gerard Butler plays dracula, of whom I am a huge fan. He does a fine job, but doesn't say much in this film. Good eye candy though!!"
4,Great revival,"This is a wonderful retelling of the old tale. The classic Dracula lore modernized with elements of the pop-culture ""slayer"" phenomena and added historical depth. Great story: Someone has finally explained Dracula's fear of Christian icons. The action sequences and special effects are a thrill to watch! The film starts off in London and moves to New Orleans. The London heist is very exciting. As for New Orleans, does Mardi Gras happen every day there? The characters are all good looking (even the clergy), but they actually have some depth. Unfortunately, their screen time does not allow the audience to really care about most of them before it's too late. Fans of Jonny Lee Miller and Omar Epps will not be disappointed! Jeri Ryan fans will be left wanting more, but will enjoy her none-the-less! Just keep in mind that this is more of an action film than a horror. Some good humour that I won't spoil, but I will say that they make great use of ""company sponsorship""."
4,"Sexy, not serious","If you're looking for a faithful adaptation of Dracula, this is not it. This is not a movie to be taken seriously. It's a fun, popcorn movie that will not make you think. At all. Seriously. Not a thought in your head, unless it is to marvel at the best thing to come out of Scotland since kilts, Gerard Butler.Butler brings a frustrated sensuality to the role of Dracula not seen since Frank Langella's campy 1970s performance. If you're not in love with him already, you will be after watching the DVD extras. His interviews are charming and fun. Though watching his audition reel, where he tried to emote wearing full ""Atilla"" hair and make-up, was sort of uncomfortable.So if you like wire fight scenes, new intrepretations of old myths, Mardi Gras beads and pretty Scots, this is the movie for you. If you want to think, there are plenty of documentary DVDs available on this site!Cheers."
4,Pretty good vampire movie!,"Well, I got the DVD today and thought it pretty damn good. The opening was good and the ending was a great finale for a vampire movie. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they changed the Dracula story a little bit and it was only 93 minutes without ending credits. If you're a Buffy fan and waiting for season 6 to start in October on UPN this should hold you over a little."
1,Terrible,"Wow this movie is bad. I love vampire and horror movies too. This guy who plays dracula is sooo wrong. He isnt charming, menacing or scary. The action scenes are just horrible. A vampire gets its head cut clean off with one swipe of a dagger. And a one handed swipe at that. Another vamp has their head cut off with a pair of lawn clippers? Wow, our hero sure has some upper arm strengh to cut through a whole neck with one motion, spine and all. These vampires acted so silly too, not like youd expect. And how about the ""virgin"" product placment in about 2/3's of the movie? Bad acting, horrible direction, no scares. Stay far away from this one."
1,Silly nonsense,"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, it's not even scary. I rented it just because Gerard Butler is in it. Thank goodness he is getting better scripts these days. I don't think this movie even has enough humor in it to ever become a cult classic. If you are are a Butler fan, put your mind in neutral and enjoy him, if not then just skip the whole mess."
2,An interesting premise ...,"... but Gerard Butler is just not that interesting to watch (at least in this movie). The first half is interesting enough, introducing Van Helsing and his secret, and the movie's theory on Dracula's origins is at least radical (involving the only man who claimed to be God and proved it - but portrayed as blue-eyed in this film) if somewhat incoherent. Points for originality.There is a particularly terrible acting choice after Van Helsing's assistant kills a vampire. I found it really annoying, as it just doesn't belong. The climax comes off as somewhat bizarre, mostly because of the setting and the movie's premise.Christopher Plummer does a good Van Helsing, but Butler comes off as bland."
1,how to explain it...,"The only words that I can think of are ""bad"" and ""stupid"". This movie really had nothing to it at all. I'll give the Judas thing being original...but even that was stupid. Why would he have a bad Transylvanian accent? I saw this movie as a waste of time and a wanna-be-Dracula-movie. Not scary, nor even that creative through most of it."
5,Drac 2000 is good sexy fun,"Other people can pick this one apart, but not me. I loved it!I will argue with those who say it's ""forgettable"": NO WAY!I'll never forget this one. Too many great twists to the legend. Too many great directorial flourishes. Too great of a Dracula!"
2,"Gerard Butler was cool, but the movie was disappointing","The story, direction, cinematography, music and visuals were not even remotely as good as Dracula (1992). Check it out only if you like to watch an attractive bad guy (Gerard Butler)."
1,even the undead wanna die,this is thee worst vampire movie i have ever seen im talking 2 hours in a grey 10 by 10 foot section of a train staring at a wooden box dracula looks like someone who would be your paperboy the acting is about as emotional as chuk norris on sleeping pills avoid this movie its a real stinker it has no beautiful set pieces no killer effects no good acting no good cast i recommend dracula 1992 with gary oldman or hell even dracula with jack palance or interview with a vampire anything but this painfully dull grey stupid movie compare this movie to riding on a london subway pukes
1,Are you kidding me?,"I am a big fan of vampire stories and movies, and whenever a new movie or a new book comes out, I must have them. When I picked up this DVD, I hadn't actually seen the movie yet. I had heard mixed reviews of it, so I wasn't sure what to expect. It started off well. But the ending was horrible. It ruined the whole thing for me. It's unfortunate. I guess not all vampire stories are good..."
1,What a joke,"I'm sorry, but this movie is not worth the price of the plastic they used for the DVD. The acting is horrible, the script is about as bad as they come. I should have known from the title..."
5,"Good Movie, even better casting!","I thought the movie was good. Although, Bram Stroker's Dracula in my opinion is a much better telling of the Dracula story. What really got my attention is Scottish newcomer Gerard Butler as Dracula himself. He excudes this intense sexuality. You ladies out there will just want to fast foward through the scenes without him. What I like about the DVD version especially is the behind the scene featurette. You get to hear Gerard Butler talk in his natural voice and it is beautiful. Gerard Butler + Scottish accent = irrestibility!!!!!"
2,not good.,"A friend of mine gave me this movie, what a waste of money!This Craven film is very cheesy, it locks creativity andoriginality.I would not recommend this film."
3,Dracula 2000,"I received the movie way ahead of the scheduled delivery date and it packaged well. The problem I had was with Wes Craven.......I found the movie rather dissapointing. I cannot understand how a movie with Dracula in the title, does NOT have Dracula as the main star."
2,Horrible let down.,I thought this would be decent since it was a Dracula movie and directed by Wes Craven but it was horrible. Gerard Butler is hot but that wasent enough to keep my attention from this snore jerker of a movie.
4,He can bite me anytime!,Best looking Dracula I've seen in a long time. Very much enjoyed the twist to the origins of Dracula. Totally makes sense once you see/hear it.
2,Feh.,"Was this a good Dracula movie? Welll, not really. I rented it on a Friday night for the sole purpose of watching a movie that I wasn't going to have to think about. And I didn't.Having said that, I have to say it's not THE worst re-telling of Dracula I've ever seen, and frankly I was mostly in it for the eye candy anyway(thank you Gerard Butler). Sadly, it had a potentially interesting premise that was weighted down by an otherwise predictable and too-cool-for-it's-own-good script, not to mention the phoned in performances of some of the actors. Visually it looks great, and it had some entertainment value, but I'm sad for what the movie could have been."
4,Very entertaining and Gerard Butler is gorgeous.,"I thought the movie was very entertaining and there were alot of well known actors in this. If you like Gerard Butler of Dracula, I think you would enjoy this."
5,An interesting twist at the end...,"I had this on VHS and was seeking to upgrade my collection (I have the subsequent sequels on DVD). An interesting retyelling of the story, particularly the ""secret origins"" of Dracula. Worth watching."
3,One sexy vampire.,"Another of my guilty pleasures. Gerard Butler ... yummy! Need I say more? Actually, this movie is pretty silly and wouldn't be worth watching at all but for one fact: Gerard Butler makes one hell of a sexy Dracula. I'd let him bite me any day. Move over, Angel - the REAL dark prince is Lady Croft's new squeeze."
4,Excellent Plot,"I liked most everything about this movie, but I found the plot to be the most unique part. I won't spoil things for any that have not seen it, but it is not your run-of-the-mill vampire movie. See it, you will like it. I thought Danny Masterson was cool"
4,Wasn't Bad,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this one. Wes Craven can be really good at times. At the very least, I can always expect some humor and a try at originality. This modern updating of the Dracula tale is pretty good. It takes a lot of the history of the famous vampire and the surrounding characters and makes them into a pretty coherent story for the modern day. In a interesting twist, they also incorporate a Christ/Judas element to the mythology. The special effects are well done, and the female vampires are gorgeous. From the acting to the story, and all around decent horror and worth a watch."
4,Dracula updated,Lots of entertainment and thrills. Okay acting and a really intriguing take on the Dracula legend. Gerard Butler is quite good as the protagonist. Loved his Scottish accent that would slip out once and a while! Who cares? He's great to look at!!Nice to see all the future stars in small roles: Danny Masterson(That 70's Show) Jeri Ryan(Star Trek) and Shane West in a very small role. Good fun!
1,It lacks bite.....,"Sorry for the bite part, but it's true, This film is predictable, gory, and has no point to it at all. When it comes to Dracula, American film makers don't get it."
1,Sooooo Stupid,"People today they dont care about the story they want Blood and Gore,Sex,Nudity this is a prime example, Dracula is a young hero who is a real ladies man and Professor Van Helsing can't survive on Dracula's Blood after all those years By now he would have became a Vampire This is more of a Sequel to Bram Stoker's Dracula watch it youll see. This piece of Crap spawned 2 Horrible Sequels that I could just Gag myself with a spoon Stick with The Hammer Movies or the Black and White films.Besides Dracula is suposed to be a aristicratic man with a Cape and Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee does the right thing"
1,Lifeless,"Just as Dracula sucks the life out of his victims so does this plot. The gothic genre is ""revamped"" for the new millenium, but let's be honest it's a tired genre with a revised storyline which must have originated from the bowels of the gutter. Tired and lifeless actors and actresses dot the film and try to push the story along, but they fail. Justine Waddell, who holds some glimmer of hope, deserves a much better vehicle in which to star. Personally, if one wants a good version of the Dracula story stick with ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" or the Bela Lugosi version."
2,CAMP,This movie is watchable camp. The best time to watch this movie is if you flip past it on a Saturday afternoon and have nothing better to do. It is better than the reality crap that floods the TV now and is the equivalent of brain candy.
5,The next James Bond I hope!,Gerard Butler is the ONLY reason I gave this flick 5 stars and the ONLY reason I watched this movie. The story was quite bad...but hey...looking at Mr. Butler for two hours more than makes up for a bad screenplay.
1,"This Movie Sure Does ""Suck""",Consider this one of the lamest movies of all time. In the first 20 minutes all of the coolest stuff in the movie happens. And these are some of the worst written horror/death scenes ever in a movie. I rented this movie and I watched the first hour of it then shut it off. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on one of the most unbelievably sucky movies ever.
1,WOW I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT THEY DID,"Am i the only one that hated this movie with a passion. I mean i can't believe i wasted my time with this. I rented it thank God and was really hoping to see another Bram Stocker's Dracula like the one with Gary Oldman. But this movie had to be the worst Dracula movie i have ever seen. I can't believe they are making a number 2. This is crazy ,what happened to sequels for good movies. Come on stop wasting money on stuff like this."
3,"""I don't drink . . .coffee.""","It's a new twist on the vampire legend that is dracula but one must question why it is that dracula was never destroyed. But I will say that the opening was executed nicely: Men breaking into a safe to claim riches. Also, the man Gerald Butler did a fine job in emulating the Dracula persona without going too over the top. But, even for all it's special effects, it still yearns for something more. Maybe if they delved into history more it would have been more interesting."
3,a weird editorial review....,"I noticed that Jeri Ryan is mentioned as a co-star in this movie, and Johnnie Lee Miller as the star. What happened to the title actor?? Gerry Butler did a fine job as Dracula, even getting a favorable comment by Christopher Plummer. Gerry isn't even mentioned on the DVD jacket!! What's up with that?? I agree with others who said the first 30 minutes are awful... it was only after Butler entered the picture that the movie was worth watching."
4,I bought it to see Gerard Butler,"I bought this because Gerard Butler (Phantom) was in it. He played Dracula. He, as always was amazing. The movie was OK.When you view the outtakes of scenes that were cut down or deleted you realize that this would have made a much better movie,it suffered with the editing decisions. Butler's Dracula is terrifying, and seductive, and OH SO SEXY."
3,"1080i, 2ch stereo, no special features?","I love this movie, and I've had it on DVD for years, so I decided to get the BluRay version. I'm disappointed, to say the least. The resolution is 1080i, but it's ok, I can deal with that. The deal breaker, though, is 2ch stereo. And where are the special features the dvd had?! Come on, it's not full 1080p, only 2ch stereo, the very -least- they could have done was copy over the special features from the DVD--it's not like they didn't have enough space on the disc and would have had to upgrade to a larger capacity disc, costing them more production money. I give a total of three stars since I love the movie, but as for the BluRay release itself? Fail."
5,"If you haven't seen it, run, don't walk to see it!!","Judging by the latest box office showing, hardly anyone is watching this great horror film. I can't recommend it enough! It is a masterful retelling of the Dracula legend. My husband and I saw it twice and it scared me just as much the second time as the first. This movie is packed with great action sequences and genuine scares. It also has a few really good suprises in store for those who see it. Yes, I said suprises. As in something ""New."" I'm not going to spoil it for you, but I do highly recommend this film, it's Craven's best since the original ""Nightmare"" movie. It's way better than those ""Scream"" thrillers he did. So if you like a good solid scary movie, along with edge of your seat thrills and a dash of humor thrown in for good measure, see this movie, you won't be disappointed."
1,"Terrible, Terrible, Painfully Terrible","This movie would be completely un-watchable if it weren't for Gerard Butler's beautiful everything. This movie actually caused me physical pain trying to pay attention to the plot(?) and the horrible actors carrying it out. Halfway through, I realized there was no point in paying attention to the pitiful story and just drooled over Gerry until the end. Only get this movie if you are a die-hard Butler fan. If not, and you have any self-respect, for the love of god pass on this sorry excuse for a film."
2,My Dracula 2000 review,"Where do I begin??? First the story was your usual Dracula story but many changes were made to make it more modern. The only thing that I think kept my interest in this film was the finale in which Dracula explains his past. Whether it was original or not the Judas reference tied in really well into his character and makes more sense then any of the other Dracula movies created in the past. I think where Bram Stoker's Dracula succeed and this film failed was that story and visuals for this film were subpar. The movie didn't contain alot of action and the little that you receive wasn't enough to scare you. I wouldn't have rented the film had my best friend told me how much it freaked him out, but after viewing it my friend looks like a chicken. Only rent this movie when nothing else is available."
4,Movie critics don't get what people like,"I thought this was an enjoyable vampire film! Sure there are some parts that could have been better, less cheesey. I wish they had went a bit more in depth in the backstory of who Dracula really is, for example. I thought the technical aspects of the film were wonderful; lighting, sets, etc. Please don't let the poor reviews keep you from watching this! The part when Dracula transforms from wrinkled old guy to a hunk with a six pack is worth the whole movie! Gerard Butler is smoking hot! Honestly, I do not understand why anyone would say no to him! I watched it on youtube because I wanted to see for myself if it was worth buying, and I have to say it is. I will order my copy now!"
2,If you have something in your blood....,"... that doesn't allow you to dislike vampire movies, then check it out. Otherwise, this is barely watchable, imo.I love vampire/werewolf movies, although I haven't seen a ton of them. This one definitely does not cut the mustard.Two things that I did like about it: 1) Obviously the chicks were nice and, 2) the origin of Dracula was an idea I hadn't heard before... very interesting, however, not my preferred origin.Other than those two, the story was kind of thin, the acting routine, and the fight scenes weak.There was really nothing meaty about this flick. It was one of those that I was tempted to fast forward through, but forced myself to watch it.Some examples of far, FAR, better vampire movies for comparison so you know where I'm coming from: Lost Boys, Interview w/ Vamp, Underworld series, Van Helsing."
3,A new twist on Dracula,I wasn't sure when I first heard of this film so I rented it first. It turned out to be a whole new take on the Dracula story. I enjoyed the new twists of this version enough to purchase the film. Not your same old Dracula.
3,Wes Craven Presents A Pretty Good Movie,"'Dracula 2000' isn't very original, but has great cast, good soundtrack, good special effects, and great acting. The opening sequence is a little disturbing but later on in the movie you will understand it. I really thought this was a very good movie. The soundtrack was good, I liked the vampire special effects, the acting had you in the moment. I espically enjoyed the cast full of great performers including: Jonny Lee Miller, Justine Waddell, Omar Epps, Sean Patrick Thomas, Jennifer Esposito, Lochlyn Monroe, Danny Masterson, Colleen Fitzpatrick aka Vitamin C, Christopher Plummer, Jeri Ryan, Shane West, and Gerard Butler as the well-acted Dracula. You should see it."
4,Good movie with an interesting twist,"Dracula 2000 was a good movie only if you keep an open mind about the movie. If you are the type of person who is looking a for a on-the-edge of your seat horror flicks, then this is not the movie for you. If you are the type of person who wants a little horror and action mixed together, then this is the movie for you. At first this movie starts a little slow, and seems to be like a crappy modern retale of a classic story. However, things change very quickly. The best part of this movie is where the orgins of Dracula are told. I am NOT going to tell you about this because I do not want to ruin the movie for you. I will say that it is an interest outake on the Dracula legend, and a much better one too! This movie also contains a killer soundtrack, and a little bit of pop culture is added into the movie a la Mardi Gras. I would recommend this movie to anyone, especially fans of vampire-type horror films. Gerard Butler portrays Dracula with a wonderful performance."
2,Always nice to see my city in a movie....,"Yes, that is about the only redeeming quality of this film. And you dont even get enough of it. New Orleans is always intriguing, yet this story is dreadful. Come on, people. Not a bit of it made any sense, and I am a vampire eficianado. I have read every vampire book, seen every vampire movie and played every vampire game and this is absolutely the worst ever since the video game version of Vampire the Masquerade came out! The curly haired guy from That 70's Show is the second thing worth seeing this movie for and he has a very short part. Without him and New Orleans this would get zero stars from me."
1,Biblical Dracula is a Crazy Idea.,"The acting is pathetic and the thrills are cheap. So what, no one really takes movies of this genre seriously. However, the infusion of distorted religious and biblical facts to justify the real origins of Dracula is obscene, offensive, and downright blasphemous. The propoderance of horror movies with religious overtones such as Stigmatina, Lost Souls, Save the Child, etc. has turned this genre into trash. Religion and horror if mixed within the context of this genre is devilish. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,Utter Rubbish,"How can anyone with any taste think this is a good film? Utter nonsense from start to finish. The worst thing was the ultra gay looking dracula. What is it with the current movie trend of casting camp, long-haired, 20-somethings? How about a decent scary dracula with screen presence, not somebody from a shampoo advert?"
4,BLOOD SUCKING GOOD,"whether your a vampire lover or just a fan of Gerard Butler, this move will make you happy. it has an interesting plot and just enough gore for horror fans!"
4,Love Dracula...The rest could be better,"I agree with most all of the reviews that say this could have been done much better. But I'm such a HUGE Gerard Butler fan, that I watch it over and over for his scenes alone. I start with the Deleted scenes, Extended scenes and Gerry's audition scenes. OMG so yummy. And the cross scene and Van Helsing scenes should have really been in the film. Then I usually skip to his first scene on the plane with Selena. My favorite scene is in the graveyard with Mary when he says. ""Everything I am is yours...And all you are,is mine. So wanted to trade places with her, and of course the bite scene and the kissing scenes. So, if you are a Gerry fan. It's so worth it. If not, it's not a bad movie, but could be better. Gerry's Dracula makes the movie."
3,Gerry Butler Must!,"I originally got this movie only because Gerry Butler is in it, but after watching it, it's really not that bad of a movie. The acting isn't the greatest, but it's still pretty good."
1,copyright violation,The Jim Barnes Estate never authorized the printing of this book and so it is in violation of copyright laws....
5,Great Pad,"I have used this pad exclusively for three years now. In that time it has seen A LOT of use, including several long backpacking trips (7+ nights) as well as weekend trips. Additionally, I have used this in a variety of different climates, from the deserts of Arizona to winters in Maine (and on several hardwood floors at friends houses).The pad is relatively light, compact, very durable, and comfortable. It holds air and insulates me from the ground in any environment. Over the course of time it seems to take a little longer to self inflate. It doesn't bother me, I usually lay it out right when I break camp and come back to it before bed.The only complaint I have is that you have to buy the carrying case separately."
2,Unsure,"The description of this pad says that it is designed with a woman's body in mind. I am not really sure how this is any different from the men's pad. I ended up returning this for a men's large since it is 5"" wider and MUCH easier to sleep on. If you have the room go with a men's large"
3,Very comfy but also very big,"It really is a great product except 2 things:1. It is not self inflatable by any means - 5 minutes work of puffing, or more if you are in high altitude.2. I is quite big and not easy to find a place for it outside the backpack...But once it is inflated.... HEAVEN"
5,Great product.,"I have used these in the past, but finally decided to have one of my own. This is a great mattress for any camper."
1,Very disappointed,I am furious. I bought the advertised thermarest because it was rectangular and would link to the rectangular one I already had. They sent me a teardrop shaped one. I could have bought a teardrop shaped one in my local camping shop for half the price that it cost me from this shady outfit. We had already started our camping trip when I discovered the bait and switch so I had to use it thereby preventing me from returning it.I am still looking for a large rectangular thermarest.
3,"Great Original Author, But...","I ordered this for my mother because she is a Zane fan. And while Zane's work has certainly stood the test of time, the DVD unfortunately needs serious work, from technical aspects to the artistic. The DVD is in desperate need of digital remastering-the sound is so fuzzy you can hardly understand what is being said and generally it needs to be cleaned up. Today's listeners, even the elderly, are used to modern advances in technical quality.Then there are the artistic issues: inciting incident too far in, inconsequential material taking up too much time, lines that are supposed to be witty but aren't, overacting, etc. Rescuing the ""new bridegroom""...we got the point after three lines."
3,Good story line,"I must admit, I got this movie with all the intentions of watching David Duchovny, it turns out to have a fairly good story line...DD looks so much younger in this movie, being a family man yet having an affair as well as gotten her pregnant. The lady, who lost her baby in an accident, stole the baby as soon as he/she was born. In a way you can see how green DD's acting is in this movie, and how much his acting skills has developed today.It's a must watch for DD fans, he is soooooo handsome in it."
2,NOT for Primary Teachers!,"I ordered this book in the hopes it would give me some time-tested ideas for discipline and behavior problems in my first-grade class. It didn't. Most of the ideas presented in this book were obviously for upper grades -- ideally, middle and high schools. Ideas for time-fillers that I hoped to use were definitely geared toward older kids (searching encyclopedias for information, cutting out specific ads from newspapers, writing small biographies). But the one thing that really got to me was this: Under the heading ""Avoiding Problems on the First Day of School"": The book says all of one sentence on how to prepare for students who cry on the first day of school. ""...Be prepared; keep a box of tissues in your desk."" Yes, it's ideas like this that made me wonder what the author was thinking when writing this book. It may have useful things for teachers of older students, but info for primary teachers is DEFINITELY lacking!"
5,Classroom Discipline Problem Solver gets an A+ from me,"This is one of the best books of its kind for beginning, new, or experienced teachers. All the bases are covered with excellent examples. The book itself is well written, and really is the one book I keep at my desk for ready reference. It has all the information in one place, and the illustrations are excellent. I only wish I had this information and practical ideas when I was learning to be a teacher. This book is a ""keeper,"" believe me. Classroom management can be the Achilles Heel of beginning teachers. This book more than evens the odds, it tilts the table in your favor. It gets my highest recommendation."
2,No Steeler Logo????,Dissappointed in the prodicuct it is a basic clip with NO Steeler logo just wording. Money better spent in my opinion. I should looked closer at the product. Good thing my 4 motnh old will not know the difference..
5,another NLP source,"Being interested in the sources of NLP, I purchased these lectures and was not disappointed. On the contrary because,even though not absolutely necessary, they give insight in the original thinking of Alfred Korzybski that inspired Richard Bandler and delight by their refreshing stile."
4,"Miracle of Modern Creation (clever, eh? eh?)","For whatever reason, I really liked punk when I bought this CD. Now, I've gotten sick of most of my punk CDs, but I still like ADF. In fact, I listened to it this morning. They've got nice funky beats, catchy choruses, and addictive riffs. Some songs worth checking out are Buzzing, Free Satpal RAM, and most of the other stuff on there. I can describe them most accurately as ""funky,"" i believe. They sound kind of like Junkie XL if he used samples from ethnic Indian music. Definitely an album worth buying."
4,A study in contrasts,I loved how Stegner created believable characters for his novel using excepts from primary source letters. To me this brought the characters into the present. I also enjoyed how the setting became its own character with its brutality challenging each of the characters. The development of the long running though dysfunctional marriage felt like a natural consequence of contrasting lives in the bleak environment. I also learned so much about early engineering in both the mines and the dams and irrigation projects of the early West as well as the art of Mary Hallock Foote. It's interesting to see how the title connects to both the vocabulary of engineering and relationships.The only challenge for me was the sometimes awkward transitions between time frames and perspective. This book is a must read.
5,A must-have for all people with good taste in music.,"This is an amazing album, it has semi-rare tracks and non-album versions of really good songs like the demo of ""miss world"" and the mtv unplugged verion of ""softer softest"", and the awesome ""hard"" song from back in the day ""burn black"". For anyone who likes hardcore (i guess) to more mellow soft grungy songs, i recommend this. Plus, hole just simply RULE, new and old stuff. And it's the step ya need between ""Pretty On the Inside"" and ""Live Through This"" i guess you can call it the last thing released before they went poppy (excluding their cover of ""Gold dust woman""). GO GET IT NOW :-)"
3,WHERE DID THIS ONE COME FROM?,"The weirdest thing about this EP is that neither Caroline (the indie label that relased Hole's freshperson album, PRETTY ON THE INSIDE, as well as ASKING FOR IT) or Geffen (which relased LIVE THROUGH THIS or CELEBRITY SKIN) issued this quirky rarities collection. By far the best tracks on it are ""Old Age"" (recorded for LTT, but never released), a haunting accoustic number reminiscent of Bruce Springsteen's NEBRASKA or GHOST OF TOM JOAD albums (or CS's ""Northern Star""), three songs from Hole's MTV Unplugged performance: (""Softer, Softest,"" Courtney's ironic remake of a Phil Spector hit ""He Hit Me (And It Felt Like A Kiss)---rendered even more bitterly ironic in light of how Phil treated Ronnie Spector---and, of all songs, Donavan's ""Season Of The Witch""), as well as searing concert versions of ""Drown Soda,"" an angry song that Andrea Dworkin, were she a rock fan, would adopt as an anthem, and a fascinating train-wreck version of ""Asking For It."""
3,Old Age,"Strange that the version of ""Old Age"" on this record is nearly identical to a song called ""Old Age"" on the Nirvana box set. The tune and intonations are nearly identical. Am I the only one who noticed?"
1,A failed attempt at speedmetal,Courtney Love cannot sing. She is no good. Kurt Cobain is alot better. Just because Nirvana is good doesn't mean hole has to be. This is their worst work ever.
4,Pefection collection of Hole material,"Finally , a collection of songs which isn't full of the hits, we already have those. Holes earlier work will really make you squirm, scary and brilliant all in one. The cover ""he hit me"" is wonderfully done as are all the mtv unplugged performances. This just goes to show, that if courtney stays true to her music, she is a wonderful writer!"
5,Collection,"MY BODY THE HAND GRENADE is a grab-bag collection of rarities, outtakes, and live cuts, mostly from the earlier phase of the group's career (i.e., before theycared much about pop hooks). It's uneven, as you would imagine; in fact, there are times when lead singer Courtney Love's incessant yammering over a backdrop of sludge guitars verges on genre parody. But ""Burn Black"" and ""Dicknail"" in particular are powerful helpings of vintage riot grrrl, and the live cuts (from an appearance on ""MTV Unplugged"") are terrific, in particular the conceptual coup of covering the sickest girl-group song of the '60s, Carole King's masochistic ""He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss)."" Rock criticism doesn't come any neater."
4,A good book for a budding instructor,"This manual for the most part, lays down rudimentary knowledge about teaching riding. Its a good source of information for someone hoping to become an instructor, and would even be good reading for someone who just started riding (to clarify questions).It has details on different types of courses for different students, rider safety, and covers student progression up to the beginner/intermediate level.For someone who has moderate experience as an instructor, it may be redundant information but its still very usefull as a reference, and will clear up any small teaching obstacles that you may have with your younger students."
2,You can do better.,"When you consider that only 1/3 of this book is in English - are you really getting what you paid for? The photos in this book are fine, but there are better FLW books out there. Pay the $47 and get ""Frank Lloyd Wright The Houses"" or ""Frank Lloyd Wright The Masterworks"" in hardcover. Both outshine this book in every way possible, and make a much better addition to your home library."
1,Could have used an editor,"I eventually stopped reading this book because the writing was so grating. It reads like a high-school writing project: awkward sentence structure, overuse of sentence fragments, klunky dialouge, and the annoying over-use of full names. I know the guy's name is ""Ethan Levin"", so you don't need to remind me every other page. Just say ""Ethan"".The story is mildly interesting, but it wasn't enough to look past what an editor should have fixed. With so many books in the queue, I wasn't going to waste time with this one."
1,Written in Computer Geek,"I admit it: I'm as much a computer geek as the next person. Well, maybe a tad more. But this novel, written about how a computer bug affects the life of its originator, wore me down. It is boring, dull, uninteresting, and plodding. It was written in how I would imagine a typical computer geek would write: every small, insignificant detail described to the nth degree, and then some! This probably would have been more interesting if the author wrote the entire novel in C++."
5,A wild ride into sound!,"Starfall is an outstanding release and a wild ride into sound. Full of power, emotion, suspense, and endless energy. It features high quality synths and keyboards through and through. Jonas's vocals melt seemlessly together with the guitars and synths. His voice soars in every song on the album. It's an all out experience listening to Starfall. Love it! Why these guys are not as well known as other bands is beyond me, but nonetheless it really doesn't matter as long as they belt out more tunes I'll be happy. For me this has been one of the best purchases I have ever made. So if you love Power Metal with uplifting elements, inteligent lyrics, amazing vocals, synths galore, and power/energy that doesn't stop....then check out Dragonland's Starfall."
4,upbeat,This is not dark techno. In a world of people trying to be hardcore this is an album of softcore music. But it is nice to sit down with a cd that is content just being good music and not insisting on grating one's nerves for the sake of a label. Orbiting Cathedrals is very good techno although it is not catchy or great for dancing. It has a good enough beat to put one in the mood to go out to party but is not a party cd. This is just a good cd of happy listening music for everyday.
3,Be careful,"Length:: 2:27 MinsThis book does have a lot of information; however, it is very general in some cases and the illustrations leave a lot to be desired. The rafter layout section is not very user friendly. The information is accurate but unless you have spent a lot of time doing this (in which case you would not need the book) then you will find yourself looking elsewhere to fill in the blanks. I have used it and gotten ideas and learned the basics. I just wish they would have given us better illustrations and with more clarity provided in their descriptions. Go to page 96 and 97 if you want a good example of how vague they can be with process descriptions.Update: The video shows the trusses I built using the information from this book. I did find it difficult to grasp the process for cutting the mortise and tennon joints but once I cut a couple it seemed simple so I have to say that in the end it was worth the money. Judge the results for yourself after you see the video."
2,"""...normal femininity..a perversion..""","Although this book has some interesting ideas, the author's perspective is limited by a narrow focus on freudian theories on penis envy and castration fear. The overall work is also tinged with an outdated 80's feminism that blames the evil patriarch for enslaving helpless women. The author seems to have a contempt of all traditional femininity. At one point she refers to parent's teaching children to act in feminine or masculine ways as 'soul murders.' The book ends with the words ""..normal femininity..a perversion, if you will."" If you are looking for progressive thinking you will find this book quite conservative."
1,Distanced from reality,"Kaplan's thesis arise from her definition of ""perversion."" But given her wide definition of perversion, what use can we make of it, for almost anything will be, and can be, encompassed within this definition?A work most distant from reality. A work of sophistry."
3,What can I say,I have a Jura coffee maker I use these to clean it.I don't know that I can give it five stars since this is the product recommended by the coffee maker manufacturer and it did it's job.
3,Too expensive,Probably it works fine. But I do believe there is nothing special in formula which makes it too expensive. Anyway - you have to pay for brand name.
3,Jura Capresso tablets,"tablets needed to clean coffee po, so it is a necessary evil in life. I think they are too expensive.quick shipping by amazon as usual ."
4,"Works well, just expensive!","Pros-There is no problem with the Descaling tablets. Although I haven't taken my Jura S9 apart I assume it is clean inside.Cons- It's expensive! I have a hard time spending this much every 6-9 months for descaling. I did a little research on descaling and it seems I can also use Citric Acid which is the ""sour"" stuff in sour candy. I bought 5 lbs (80 ounces)of Citric Acid on line for $20. The machine requires approximately 1 ounce per cleaning. At 2 ounces a year, that's about 30 cents a year. Even in this economy, I can afford that!The cleaning process is the same. I will update with my results after 1 year of use."
3,A lot better than vinegar,I used the tablets in a starbucks Barista espresso machine. It seemed to release a lot of deposits that had built up in our machine and once thoroughly rinsed operated more efficiently.
3,No Longer in Stores,"I love my Jura coffee maker, but there aren't any stores in the Boston area that carry them anymore. Luckily, I can count on Amazon to get these shipped to me overnight so I can have my coffee in the morning. Thanks, Amazon!"
5,"They taste great, and less filling!",They shipped the tablets that the manufacturer no longer has available through their website.six more words are still required
1,Jura-capresso tablets,"Unfortunately, the amount that I had ordered was not shipped. I requested 3 packs and was told by Amazon that I would have three and 1 was shipped. The product came in tact, however, I could not justify the 7.00 shipping for 1 package. I have returned the package and awaiting my refund. As of 7-2-10, I still have not received this and the product was returned almost one month ago.The rating is for Amazon, not the product."
4,"Great album, but lacking the original stereo sound","For years I have had a tape copy of the LP issue of this album. My copy sounded pretty good, but I knew that a good CD reissue could sound even better, so I recently picked up the 1999 Capitol reissue that can be found here. I was shocked when I heard the CD--although the sound was very clean, certainly a carefully done transfer, it was obviously done from a monophonic tape. What happened to the original, 1961 stereo master, which sounded glorious? Perhaps it was damaged or lost--who knows.That said, if you don't have access to a copy of the stereo LP, this CD is well worth hearing, for the quality of the music, arranging, and playing. Some of the other reviewers go into detail about Gene Roland and his innovative charts for this album, so I will not repeat them here. Recommended, with reservations about the mono sound."
5,Excellent story on the outlook on life.,I have just finished this book by Brian Van Hise. His characters are well developed with a good flowing story line. There are a few twist here and there which made it hard for me to put it down. I am for certain looking forward to his next publication. Keep it up Brian.
2,The suicide treatment,I was warned by the author (my son) that I would not like this book and he was right. The main reason is that it wasn't the genre of story I enjoy reading. Evidently I'm not a very deep thinker. I felt there was an over use of metaphors. After reading the book I checked out the study guide on his web site and it did help me appreciate the book more. I do agree with the reviewer who mentioned it could be used in psychology to study a different view of suicide.
1,Flimsy product from usually reliable Bodum,"Looking at water kettles and reading reviews I decided to ignore the cheapest (which seemed to be plastic-y and not long lasting) and go for a Bodum, as I have used their products in the past. I know $40 is still inexpensive for a water kettle in the US (I dont know why) but I expected more bang for my buck. The Bodum kettle is made of cheap plastic that actually is bendable when heated. The smell in the kettle is of burnt plastic and while it works very well (boils water fast/shuts off/has nice design) I cannot bring myself to drink water from this kettle - would you boil water in a plastic take-away container? That is what it seems like to me. I never expected such cheap quality possible in electric kettles since I have lived in Ireland where every household has one and there are never any as flimsy as this Bodum kettle."
1,Bad quality,"First the good:- it looks good and doesn't take up much counter space- you can boil a very small amount of water, and it is very quickNow the bad:- the connection to the base melts (and then it no longer works)The first one of these that I got lasted only 7 months. Thinking I just had bad luck, I foolishly got a second one (it does look better than most other kettles out there..), but that one lasted just over 1.5 years."
1,Another melt-down,"As like the others have stated ... this is a great product but only for a very short time. Mine lasted about 6 months before the base actually melted ... now, how scary is that ... you purchase something because you feel its safer ... and it ends up being a possible fire hazard. I'm surprised this item hasn't been recalled."
2,broken after 2 years,"I also paid full price for the ""Bodum"" expecting a quality that would last for a very long time. Its been two years, and I was not using it for about 1 year of that time where it was stored away. Now it seems to be melting around the connectors on the base, and it stays on all the time it is connected, no more auto shut off (though that was pretty disappointing when it was working). So I'm off to buy a new one, a non-Bodum. I don't recommend this kettle to anyone."
1,Korean Version,This particular version is in Korean! Amazon should really specify this - thank goodness another reviewer posted how to navigate the menus to find the English version without subtitles...
1,Title is the best thing about it,"This is a review of the movie, not the DVD package itself, which I've never seen. ""Shark Skin Man"" is one of the worst movies I've seen Asano in. Pseudohip, relentlessly unfunny manga gangsterism, with sub-sub-Tarantino dialogue, flashy but mediocre camerawork, and bad acting all around. Uneven pacing, too, and the MTV Asia-style director knows less than nothing about making movies. Target audience for this is twitchy 12 year olds who have just finished watching every episode of Dragon Ball Z and want to watch live action anime."
2,I fell asleep........ TWICE!!,"I love japanese film. I really wanted this to be good. Even though I liked the character development and the plot was ok I just couldnt get into this. I actually fell asleep.... twice! The camera work at times can be interesting but some scenes are way too drawn out without really going anywhere. The mood and pace of the film is very monotone and flatline, especially for a film that touts itself as being this grand rollercoaster ride. And in response to another reviewer here, Taranteno does take alot from asian cinema, but asian cinema borrows alot from western culture as well, at this point there is alot of equal give and take. If you want to see an interesting so called ""cool"" japanese film see Samurai Fiction instead."
1,"Tried to be Tarantino, failed miserably","This director tried his best to reproduce every Quinten Tarantino movie I've ever seen, and failed miserably. The best thing about this movie is the title, which you can see at the top of Amazon's page and spare spending the $$$ on a waste of a perfectly good blank DVD."
1,Probably the worst film in my foreign film collection.,"Really? This film comes at you with a raging pace, with people standing still, and the camera not moving. It's all style (or at least tries to be) and almost no substance. You have absolutely no reason to care for the characters or for two leads to even to be together. I find myself wondering where is any of the motivation, at all? It's just random ""cool idea for a mob guy"" characters slammed together, and a guy and a girl equally slammed together in a story that ultimately does nothing and means nothing. How many times did I just want a static scene of a man sitting there to end up with the guy putting a bullet in his head so we can just get on with the rest of the film.All the characters seemed oddly disconnected from each other, which ultimately created a disconnect between myself and the film. One word... tedious."
4,Fabulous for what it is.,"For what it is, a large cast Yakuza film which in reality is about the ""awakening"" of a young girl, this is a well put together piece, hence why it even sees the light of day at all in the US. Characters are colourful and entertaining, certain scenes seem absolutely outrageous, and while there are cliche moments they are not the ones the American eye is seeing. But that's fine: if you laughed a bit at the stupidity of some of the characters ridiculous costumes and cheered for the weasely gay unibrowed assasin, well, maybe you did like the movie.And once again, Asano Tadanobu is brilliant. And if you're a fan of his you'll be entertained for months with this movie."
1,Disappointed,"Living with Dysthymia all of my life, I was happy to see a book that might shed some light on my condition. I didn't get that in this book. It felt like I was reading one long advertisement for their clinic. I've read many other books that cite case studies as examples that give hope. I was looking for hope and found a sales pitch."
2,okay,"so many things he misses, so much obvious stuff he includes, and so little detail on the meaning of some of the annotations end up making this book somewhat of a nuisance, breaking up the flow which makes the Wake enjoyable. I still prefer Joseph Campbell's Skeleton Key to FW, though it admits that it does not try to catch every allusion. I find that most of the things that I really do want to find out, where I hear some echo of something, he doesn't touch on, or doesn't touch on to my satisfaction. Really, this project should be a collaboration online where people would add their comments to the possible meanings of different lines, because there are so many. Each man comes at it with his own knowledge, interests and needs, and can't get everything. So while this is useful for some, it's more of an impediment for me. A tattered security blanket that trips you up while you walk, you feel like Linus from peanuts lugging out this big blue thing."
3,They get better with time,"I didn't know Space Tribe until recently and bought their latest album(2000 O.D.)and loved it.Since I loved it so much I decided to buy one of their previous albums, which turned out to be Sonic Mandala.And by doing so I have learned an important lesson in trance music: all the trance groups get better with time. As you may have guessed I was disappointed by the cd, don't get me wrong, the cd ain't that bad, it just doesn't live up to their last effort. Overall it just plain lacks depth: you'll feel like your listened to the same tracks over and over. Take it from me: if you buy some Space Tribe, buy one of their latest cd and you shouldn't be disappointed."
4,An Exhaustive (and Exhausting) Collection,"With over 50 stories and over 1050 pages of text, ""The World Treasury of Science Fiction"" is quite a heavy read. The book contains shorts from almost all of the major science fiction writers of the 20th Century (at least up until 1989, when it was published). Some of the tales are among the best I've ever read, like Phillip K. Dick's chilling military piece ""Second Variety,"" Kurt Vonnegot's angry satire ""Harrison Bergeron,' Larry Niven's apocalyptic ""Inconstant Moon"" and Rene Rebetez-Cortes's evolutionary horror story ""The New Prehistory."" Others I didn't like so much, but some of that was a matter of taste not quality.The book is not presented in any kind of recognizable order, but there is a brief introdutory blurb for each author. I would recommend it with the caveat that most readers are likely to skip over some of the less appealing entries."
2,An Out-of-Date Resource for Swahili Vocabulary,"This is a reprint of Perrott's dictionary that was first published in 1965 but based on much much earlier lexicographical work. It is a simple glossary with mostly single equivalencies given. The Swahili-English section is adequate for simple, basic sorts of vocabulary, but it contains none of the new terminology and vocabulary that has entered the language since the original lexicographical research was done. So, for instance, it would be inadequate for reading a modern Swahili newspaper, let alone a novel or modern play. Many of my students over the years have used this book and it was a useful tool given a lack of a pocket-sized Swahili dictionary that a student could easily carry around. But students had a lot of problems using the English-Swahili section of the book. Many times the gloss given for a particular English word, is not the correct one, or does not reflect modern meanings or usage."
4,If it's good enough for the Peace Corps...,"Next to my mefloquine tablets, this was the next-most-used resource the PC gave me. ""Short"" and ""comprehensive"" are generally mutually exclusive, but this dictionary managed to strike a good balance. If you're looking for a desk reference, there are more comprehensive dictionaries around. But if you're looking for something that doubles as a portable language reference and something to throw at black mambas, this is it."
2,superficial but helpful,This book is useful in that it is simple and caters for the beginner however in a predominantly spoken language like Kiswahili there are usually multiple translations for each word. As this book only gives one or two translations for each word then it can be misleading at times.
3,Good but showing age,"I got this Dictionary with Teach Yourself Swahili. The both of the books are showing age, but especially the dictionary. At least the Textbook had a word for Computer(Kompyuta) in it! The dictionary has the needed words though, don't get me wrong. The word ""to look"" is very important.Oddly, I did find a use for the dictionary in a very modern reference though. I translate some Swahili from the Simpsons myself and it added up to the translation they had on TV, so hey! I guess that is a bad example, but their are few good Swahili dictionaries and this one is pocket sized."
1,Don't waste your money or time. Get another book.,"This book is poorly written and barely edited. There are horrible grammar and punctuation mistakes. The authors should've had a seventh grader proof read this! It made me sad to think that women with PCOS don't have a lot of options as far as information goes. This book was embarrassing to read! I gave it one star because there wasn't an option for zero stars. I couldn't take the information or the author seriously because it was so poorly written. Buy the ""When The Doctor Says It's... PCOS"" book instead. You'll feel better. Trust me."
3,"This book is okay, but there is better","While this book does provide good information, I think that you can do better. Most of the book is written almost as an advertisement for the author's own PCOS clinic. She spends so much time touting how wonderful that she is that it is hard to read the book. It also made me wonder how accurate the information is, or if she just wanted to brag on herself and her clinic. If you get this book do not make the mistake I did and also order ""Its my Ovaries, Stupid!"" by the same author. They books are almost exactly the same. I recommend ""The PCOS* Protection Plan: How to Cut Your Increased Risk of Diabetes, Heart Disease, Obesity, and High Blood Pressure"" by Colette Harris."
5,Why do you read this review???,"Not much to say about this disk...If you are a music lover, you gotta own this CD. Full Stop."
5,Gloria A. Gould-Loftin - ravens_warlock@yahoo.com,"Arthur C. Clarke, Ray Bradbury, Jorges Luis Borges and Raymond Carver at their best. Four timeless tales from the abstract minds of four of our greatest sci-fi authors. A thrill a minute..!"
5,One of Tammy's Best Efforts,"This album was initially recorded in 1970 when Tammy Wynette was at the peak of her vocal powers. The ten track set is divided into two parts, the first half of which is comprised of hymns like ""Silent Night"" and ""Joy To The World."" The second half is far more interesting (and color coded) with modern holiday classics like ""Blue Christmas"" and ""White Christmas"" joined by the Carmen Taylor originals ""One Happy Christmas"" and ""Let's Put Christ Back In Christmas."" Best of all is ""(Merry Christmas) We Must Be Having One,"" the definitive Tammy carol, as her tearful voice turns the routine festivitites into an ultra-emotional occasion. There have been a number of Wynette reissues released since her death, but this is easily the most moving. It should never have fallen out of print."
2,Christmas with Tammy,Bought this cd for one song....quality was scratchy and unclear sounding. Wasn't very expensive and I'm able to hear the song I originally bought it for.
1,Please do not pay money for this collection,This vendor is charging more than $500 for tracks which are not rare. DO NOT waste your money on this 'collection'
3,good for cleaning spots off walls,"I used this to remove scuffs off my white walls, and it worked really well! It got tough stains off too, which I was pleasantly surprised about. However, it did leave a film on my walls that made the areas I cleaned look streaky. It was effective in removing stains, but next time I will use it more sparingly, as it does make my white walls look streaky after use."
4,Does a fair job,"bought this charger for a sony w580i. it fits the phone on the side, so that's a little goofy, but you still have functionality when it's plugged in. cover is handy though if you put it battery mode with no batteries in it, it's a little tough to remove. when putting in AA batteries it's a bit of a tight fit, but i guess this is to hold them in place. i first thought i had the wrong size. also i now realize the batteries probably help you open the cover.noticed that the batteries got really hot when they finally went dead. a set of fresh batteries are good for about a 3 to 4 hour charge (about one and a half full charges by my estimate for the battery on the w580i). there is no warning when the AA batteries are dead, so you'll have to check periodically to make sure your phone is still charging."
1,I'm really rating the listing...,Consumer alert - this is the exact title being sold under a different listing on Amazon for about 1/5 the price. All copies are both Don McLean records and Madacy Label Group.
4,An enjoyable listen,"This is a don't miss recording for Don McLean fans and for people who have heard the hits and are ready for more. A great mixture of Don's singing and his interaction with a live audience. He plays all the big hits but he also plays some of the Don McLean fan favorites that we never get to hear on the radio like If We Try, Jerusalem and Superman's Ghost. The duets with Nancy Griffith are really a treat.This album does not dissappoint."
4,Very Good little Amp,"Bought this for my son when his older amp died. Believe it or not the amp works fine with an electric guitar (he does not have an acoustic). When 1st purchased, I did not realize that there was a difference between acoustic and electric amps. After listening to it, we can not discern any meaningful degredation in sound quality from his previous amp. It is a great machine and highly recommended."
5,Versatile in small amp,"Being a small amp light weight (EZ) to carry and having the ability to do both vocal and electric instrument, this was a great find. Beside being a practice amp I was able to play for a small congregation of beer drinkers (couple of dozen) without having to crankup the volume to get past all the chatter."
5,Perfection,"I say perfection, because this amp does exactly what I wanted it to do. It is also a great value for what it does. It offers ample volume for small venues. I love having two mic inputs and the CD input. The Behringer AT108, along with my Fender amp, gives me plenty of performance capability."
5,Good Amp For The Money,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this, but after reading the reviews I thought why not. It is actually a good little practice amp. I'm still fiddling with the knobs and changing the sound to suit my mood. It gives me the portability I needed to move about my house. I was using a mixer that's hooked to one of my PCs and using that sound card for sound. That works great, but sometimes I don't want to be tied down to the PC. I use the PC arrangement for recording and the amp for private relaxing guitar playing wherever I want to have it. I recommend this little amp wholeheartedly. Just be mindful that it isn't a $500 Marshall amp, but it does well in a pinch."
5,"Small package, big performance","Great sound from a really small, fairly attractive package. Used mainly for voice, this was a perfect solution for me."
4,Good buy.,this is a great deal and a second channel for the mic input which many don't offer. sounds good and it's versatile.
3,Behringer AT108 15-Watt Acoustic AmplifierBehringer USA,"good sound, light and small. The ear phone outlet dos not work. it came with all instructions how to use it."
4,VERY GOOD BUT SOME PARTS ARE VERY WEAK,My daughter is very happy. IT IS A VERY TOY BEAUTIFULL.THE BAD:IT WAS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF PLASTIC. IT WAS BROKEN.
3,Cool Tricycle but the wheels stink!,Very cool tricylcle but the wheels stink literally. The rubber smell was very strong evevn inside the garage so we had to store the trike outside. A month later the wheels still smell. We are not sensitive to smells either. Otherwise a cool trike but assembly takes some time.
1,missing wheel on 1 of the 5 roadmaster i order !!!!!,"this little bikes where a gift for a pour children shelter in Honduras Central America , 4 of them were wonderful, but 1 has a missing back tire ? i dont know what happen , i cant send them back because i shipp them exactly as they arrive on my house , was a real shame those people on china really need to improve themself."
1,not any good,peddles are to small seat is not proportional to handles and peddles a waste of money got kid another bike
5,Perfect,This trike was easy to assemble and we did not have the horrible smell that a few people have mentioned. My 2 year old daughter LOVES it. She has never rode a trike before and within minutes of getting on this one she was riding around.
1,Returned the product,"Finishing of the product was poor and assembly of the seat in general was really loose. As soon as my son sits on it the seat will displace. Also, the assembly at the rear wheels is designed in a way, which makes noise when it is ridden. I returned this product finally."
1,"Obviously opened box, sloppy refurbish","The trike box was obviously not new, but had been opened and then taped back closed. The box also had some damage (the outer Amazon box did not have damage). I opened the box and the components were still in bubble wrap, but the parts bag was incomplete (but sealed).So basically it looks like someone returned this, and the factory did an exceptionally sloppy job of ""refurbishing"" it -- didn't include all the parts, didn't repair/replace the box, taped it back together with a sloppier tape job than I'm returning it with.This may be a great trike; I have no way of knowing. But this experience doesn't make me want to buy another Roadmaster product."
2,Trikes for twins,"The boxes were pretty beat up upon arrival,checked out contents,all parts are there. Smell from tires was so strong in the house had to put trikes parts spread out on porch to air out. Of course everything comes from China and we don't know what garbage went into making the tricycle wheels. These are going to be Xmas gifts for 18 mos. old granddaughters if the smell is gone by then. Would I buy these again ,No."
2,Just OK,"The look and price of this trike was just what we wanted, but we have owned it for one year and it has been a slight disappointment.1. Upon opening the box the bike smelled awful! It took at least two weeks of sitting outside before the chemical smell was gone. Do not plan to open/assemble the night before Christmas and Birthday, it will stink up the whole house.2. It was missing a nut and bolt from the part of the bike that came assembled! This meant a trip to the hardware store.3. The seat came off (after just a month or so of light use and we had a friend rivet it back together)4. Now after one year of use the seat/frame has come apart again and must be welded back if we want to use it again.Bottom line, I would not buy this trike again."
2,Didn't last as long as I thought.,"I purchased this for my child. Within a few weeks, pieces were starting to fall off. The seat would not stay in place. The wheels were coming off. The paint was already starting to rust. It was an all around poor purchase."
4,Works for our little darling!,"Was looking for a retro trike and this one fit the order. No problem putting it together.......fair price, quick shipping. I'm happy."
2,Smells of smoke!,"I do not know where they keep their stock, but beware if you are asthmatic as it reeks so badly of smoke! I washed it 4 times and it still reeks!"
2,Very questionable quality?,"The family just opened their Christmas gifts this morning - the tricycle was the main event. My son put it together from the package sent. His 1st comment that it's a very flimsy tricycle, and he questions if it's going to last very long. He was quite disappointed and it made me feel awful. I just went by the review you rec'd - and I was quite surprised that he was upset with the quzlity of thie item. He said the bushings were only made out of plastic? He thought it should be better items to put it together. Now I feel so inadequate that I sent this gift by going by your photo and reviews - very sad. I would have bought something MORE advantageous instead - hope many read this review and think twice? elaine andersen"
1,Piece of junk,"I was so excited to read the great reviews on this trike when we bought it for my 2 year old son. I researched trikes for weeks before deciding on this one. Now I'm only wishing my husband had saved the box so we could return it. Basically we're just taking the loss on the money paid and buying a different brand entirely.The construction is TERRIBLE, the seat doesn't tighten and just falls to the side no matter what you do, and if anything at all even slightly touches the metal, the paint chips right off. We are extremely disappointed - as is our son who can't even ride his new trike because the seat's so completely unsafe."
4,Nice little bike,"I bought this bike for my 2 yr old b-day. And it's a nice bike, very well built and looks great. It has hard rubber wheels, something that is a plus cause you don't want to always be pumping the tires. Heck, I'm 40 and over 200 lbs and was able to ride it without crushing the wheels. But there's the issue. I can ride the thing but my 2 yr old legs are still too short. So, it's going to get put away till next year. But of course, that's also an advantage cause I can just recycle the gift. Hey it's a recession, got to save money somehow."
4,trike,The Roadmaster Trike was easy to assemble and is exactly as pictured. We are pleased with the purchase even though it was delivered late. I could have bought it locally for what I spent on it plus delivery and had it for Xmas day. Who knew.
1,cheap cheap cheap,"This trike is awful! It's just junk. Spend the extra money & get a better trike. You'll waste too much time assembling the thing & it won't be a good ride. Plastic clips & pieces that don't fit together well. The steering handle bars twist out of line. I'm quite sure the front wheel isn't perfectly round, because it doesn't roll smoothly. I would have returned it but wasn't up for the hassle of boxing it & shipping."
1,"Missing parts, and just before Christmas","Ordered trike and received it in a timely manner, but there were screws + nuts + bolts + washers missing from the box (best guess is that there was a whole bag of parts needed for assembly, and it was absent). The packaging was a clear indicator that the trike had previously been returned, so it seems likely that something happened with the return / resale process. Had to send it back. Very disappointed. Boo."
3,The closest thing to an original Trike,"Unlike most of the stuff out there, its made of metal. Now whether or not that means anything, well time will tell. The materials seemed to be decent quality. The 30 day warranty is a joke. As usual, the service from Amazon was excellent."
3,Not heavy duty.,"I ordered the tricycle for my grandson because it reminded me of the one that I bought for his mother around 30 years ago. I really like the style of the tricycle, but it is not as sturdy as I had expected it to be."
4,Tricycle,"This trike is just the cat's meow for my 2 year old Grandchild. However in the assembly of it I was missing two parts, one a bolt and the other a lock pin for the rear axle. Thankfully I could get it a Lowe's before Christmas morning."
2,Undersized Trike,"Received this Trike and was struck by how small it seemed for an advertised size of 10 inches. Upon measuring the front wheel in actuality it is only 9 inches, and the rear wheels, instead of being 8 inches as advertised are approximately 6-1/2 inches. Be advised for those that may be sensitive to chemical odors that the rubber tires have an extremely strong smell coming from them. This out gassing as it's called may linger for a quite sometime and the Trike may have to be kept outdoors.."
1,Returned to Amazon,"After reading some great reviews I've decided to give this trike a try and purchased it on Amazon for my 3-year-old. Price was the determining factor. I wanted something my son could play for few years and move on to a full bike, I wasn't looking for the most durable product.The package arrived on time, but items seems to be ""open-box"", as I can see dents on some of the parts, all tires had signs of use as I can see specs of dirt on them. This is the first time I've gotten a ""returned"" item advertised as ""new"" from Amazon. Let's just hope that this experience is one time thing, and will not happen regularly with Amazon.Pro:Amazon's great return policy.Con:Got an open box item (probably with some parts missing)The tires smelled awful.The front wheel is smaller than the advertised picture.The trike is smaller than expected."
1,Roadmaster Tricycle,"Once this tricycle was finally assembled with all the right parts, my 2 yr old granddaughter loved it. The original shipment was missing parts. The manufacturer was contacted and sent replacement parts to the wrong address. After contacting the manufacturer again, the parts pack was sent to the correct address but parts were still missing. Another go-around resulted in the wrong parts again. Finally, we went to the store and bought them ourselves. When my granddaughter finally got on the trike the pedal kept coming off. After that was fixed the trike was great. We would have returned it, but by the time we were done trying to get the correct parts, it was too late to send it back. I would recommend never buying this product. I would recommend tha Amazon stop carrying it. Amazon was great however. They did refund my priority shipping."
1,Very poor quality,First shipment was missing most of the parts even though the box had not been opened. Second shipment had most of the parts but had to use some from first shipment. Very poorly constructed. Can't adjust seat to hold. The handlebars won't tighten so that they won't get out of alignment with the front wheel. The axle nuts won't stay on. SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy a different brand.
3,not like I remembered,"I bought this trike for my son's 2nd birthday. I had one when I was a child and loved it. It lasted through two very rough boys. I'm affraid this one will probably fall apart within a year. The metal is very thin and cheap, the paint doesn't even cover the metal in some places and it just feels flimsy. I suppose you get what you pay for these days what with everything being made somewhere in China.Overall; it's OK for the money but, definately not like the one I remember from my childhood."
1,cheap quality and terrible instructions,"while the trike is apparently made of steel, the rest of the pieces are cheap, many plastic, and fit together poorly. The instructions are also terrible, with tiny print (i have 20/20 vision and had a hard time making out which pieces were which), and confusing making it quite difficult to assemble, even with correct tools (note: I have no problem with other instructions, like Ikea instructions). it also requires 2 people to assemble. My favorite though was the fact that as soon as my son started riding it on his birthday morning, the pedals starting flying off - and those were preassembled in the box! I would give this no stars if I could. The only good thing are the rubber tires. I purchased an italtrike (one of the ones made in italy not china) at an actual store, it was already assembled for me so I can't speak for assembly ease, but it is great quality so far. nothing flying off."
2,"The paint smelled bad for few days, the front wheel was twisted","\\The picture of this bike for sure looks much better than its look in the real life. For some reason the made the front wheel in the picture bigger than its actually is in reality.When you openned the bike package I got this weird smell, I think it was the paint, which lasted for few days, and then went away thankfully.Also the front wheel was twisted a little. I should have returned this bike, but my kid was expecting it for few days, I could not make him for few more days till I get another one. My kid is two years of an average height, but he barely can use it"
5,Best. Design. Book. Ever,"I have used some of Fink's other materials and always liked them (i.e.""Fink's Five Principles of Good Teaching""). This was the text for a Community College Program Design Course and I know I will keep it forever. Perhaps it is because the book matches my idea of what good design should include and is not so complicated that it makes good instructional design overwhelming.I feel my courses are more complete, my students are learning more - I know because I'm getting better results on the assessments, course evaluations and word of mouth recommendations to take my sections.You will reach for this book every time you want to design a new course or update an older one."
5,Exceeded my expectations,This book changed the way I design my college level courses in a very effective and enjoyable way. It will give you a lot of insight on the design of courses that will encourage students to continue learning. I also enjoyed all the reference on the results of scientific work that deals with innovative teaching methods. You will love this book.
5,The absolute best,"This is THE most organized, thorough book for learning Spanish grammar. It is full of lessons and exercises that are extremely well organized and straightforward. I am currently in the Spanish Second Year workbook (of the same series). I've purchased many Spanish workbooks, but appreciate this one the most."
1,Disappointed,"This product arrived timely and in poor condition. With one third of the book already completed, it was completely useless for us."
2,Tight & Not Secure Enough,"These gloves were so tight that the tips of my fingers tingled while I fell asleep the first night that I wore them. They were a BIT looser by the morning but still not great. However, the part that fits around my wrist is INCREDIBLY loose and does not even touch my wrist. I am very dissapointed and am on the hunt again for a great glove. By the way, I am only 110 pounds so do NOT have very big hands. I can't imagine what a more normal sized person might experience with these!"
1,Extremely small... one size doesn't fit all.,"I picked these up to help with a case of dry skin. I've got rather large hands which I often have a difficult time purchasing gloves for. These did not fit the bill. Very, very small. Even though they are cotton with a bit of spandex, they were hard to put on and did in fact affect circulation. I was only able to try them for a few minutes. They were just too uncomfortable to wear. I can't imagine that they would fit a male with anything larger than medium size hands."
4,"funny, intersting talk","There aren't a lot of sources of John Lilly audio out there, so this is great to have. The sound quality is fair/decent. The biggest problem is that the tape speed is not steady, to the point that the timing of his speech is a little hard to parse. Humoress pauses are shortened, and phrases whizz by. It's all comprehensible, but it would be great if someone could pull this into a computer and clean it up a little.The talk itself is wonderful. Lilly has an absurdist sense of humor, and sounds like a really interesting guy to be around. I wish there was more material available. I recommend this over the ECCO CD. The ECCO CD is ambient/techno music with a few random snippets of Lilly speaking. It sort of seems unnecessary. It's not great music, and it's not satisfying if you want to hear Lilly speak. The K Talk is way better, imho."
5,This was a gift.,The flute pac was a Graduation Gift for my grandaughter. The color was great and just what she wanted for her flute. I'm happy and so is she.
1,A one sided affair,Have you ever notice that these so called individuals who don't believe in a God only have a problem with christinity.The truth will alway be under attact by people who are have nothing better to do with their time and simply like to live a life full of hypotheses.
2,We will not know till...,"As like all books that deal with refuting Christianity, Dr. Martin sets out by claiming there is no real way to test to see if Chritianity is true. All of us on this side of the fence know it to be true by our inside awareness of God. The rest say, ""No, He does not exist!"" Well, only at death will we all know the truth."
5,Thorough and scholarly,"In ""The Case Against Christianity"", Michael Martin takes the tenets of Christianity head-on with a cool, rational approach that is by far the best I've come across. In a thorough, step-by-step way, he examines and refutes all of the fundamental doctrines of Christianity, as well as many modern apologist arguments. Although occasionally the text gets slightly bogged down in philosophy-speak, Martin is a philosopher, so I suppose that he can get away with this. In any case, I highly recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in the rational and historical arguments for and against Christianity."
1,Several Problems..,"I found that Mr. Martin misunderstands the historical truths that he is trying to argue against. Its hard to keep reading when you realize that he doesn't have a correct understanding of history. As another review has said, he sometimes writes as if he has not done the research to make a good argument for the issue and explains his difficulties with his own philosophical ideas and objections. I was surprised he didn't do more research before writing a book like this."
1,Biased and one-sided,"Why does this author refuse to consider that there is an intellect and power greater than his own? Don't waste your time on this one.... For a book on this topic that is easier to read and is more open-minded to truth, check out The Reason for God."
1,A waste of my money,"If, like me, you want a phone cover that DOES NOT have clip on the back, don't buy this. It has the removable clip as advertised. What is not advertised is the mount for the clip that is fixed tight (riveted) to the back of the cover. It is NOT NOT NOT removable. Trying to do so only ruins the cover. I know, because I tried.All you businesses out there: accurate descriptions make for happier customers."
1,DID NOT RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT YET ...,"I can't rate what I have not received. It was supposedly shipped on 7/13/2010, but has not yet arrived. This has been my most disappointing purchase through Amazon.com. All other products I have ordered through Amazon, arrived in a timely manner."
1,Not zero carbs,"I was looking everywhere for a really low or zero carb jerky because I'm on one of those diets where I'm not supposed to consume any sugar. Found this zero carb jerky, which I just went back and double checked the page from which I purchased it and it definitely says ""zero carbs"" under product description, abut turns out that it has 5 grams of sugar per ounce and 6 grams of carbohydrates. I already cracked a bag open and started eating it before flipping it over to discover this. Very unhappy and disappointed, I already had great beef jerky (with sugar in it) at home and didn't buy this expensive jerky so that I could have more. They need to be clear on the product description because the little picture isn't big enough to see if it says zero carbs on it or not."
1,Low quality - hardly edible,the jerky was so tough i was only able to eat 1 out of ever 3 pieces. was a complete was of money. i'm very disappointed in the product. the only positive is that it is low sodium (either by make or by the fact that only a few pieces are edible)
1,Please choose another brand,"I received this in the mail this morning and tore the package open excitedly, because I've been craving some beef jerky lately. But oh my goodness, I couldn't even swallow the first piece. Even my dog stopped eating them after 2 pieces.It's hard to describe the flavor other than salty and metallic (I got the Teriyaki). The jerky is also alarmingly thick and covered with this sawdust-like powder, and most of the pieces have broken up into crumbs.I will definitely not be finishing the bag I opened, and hopefully I'll be able to give the other 5 bags to someone who is hungry enough to take them. I'm not one to complain about products, but I've also never felt so strongly about spreading the news to stay away from this stuff."
1,Almost worst jerky I've ever had!,"This stuff is terrible! It's not hot & spicy in any way, unless you can count the coating of chili powder all over it & the bag. The jerky itself has NO flavor at all. I repeatedly tried it over and over, hoping it was just a bad piece/batch/bag, but it was all the same - terrible, terrible flavor. If you think this will be ANYTHING like Jack Link's peppered jerky, or ANY peppered/hot jerky for that matter, you're going to be very disappointed."
1,Not so good......,"I am someone who LOVES beef jerky and I was hoping this tasted better than it does. It has a very strange texture (a dry mushy testure - if there is such a thing) and the taste was strange (carboard like and bland). I like to buy healthy snacks and food items so I was hoping this would taste much better. I was expecting a difference in taste and texture due to the lack of MSG which does add a lot of salt flavor and texture to traditional beef jerky BUT this just out right does not taste good. I can sacrifice for the benefit of a more natural product but I found this jerky to be beyond my threshold of tolerance.I am hoping to try and use it as dog treats so the purchase is not a complete waste and also add a bag to my hurricane supplies (as a food of last resort). I would suggest trying to locate this product locally and trying it before you buy it in the bulk 6 bag size from Amazon to make sure it is a taste and texture you would like, we didn't!"
3,"Flavorful, but not incredible","I have tryed the majority of spicy jerky on the market. I can't say that Wild Ride Gallopin Pepper was my favorite, but it does have decent flavor. The character of the poduct is a smoky flavor with a little spice, but being one who likes hot foods, it didn't have enough to get my engine running. I think it is a decent product, but at least the shipment I got was extremely dry. I know it is jerky, so it's like it is supposed to be dry, but other brands I have had like World Kitches seem to retain a little more of the natural oils and juices. I would eat this again, but given the choice other brands seem to give me the kick I'm looking for more than this."
3,Jerky or Jerked,"Wasn't good, but wasn't bad. The main thing is that it doesn't have the nitrites the other jerky has and is all natural!"
2,definitely not premium jerky,"I had high hopes for this product, but I was seriously disappointed. I was expecting good quality beef jerky, but it is definitely not.The good: it's not tough like leather - it's actually pretty moist and unlikely to go stale once you open it because of the individually wrapped packages. It's also sold at a good price.The bad: I could detect basically no taste of black pepper at all, which was supposed to be the main flavor. Instead, it has a strange taste I can't put my finger on -- more chemical than natural. I've had plenty of black pepper-flavored jerky, and none of them tasted like this.Unless you're on a serious budget, I would avoid this product. Perhaps the other varieties taste better, but I'm not willing to risk it."
3,It's okay..,"I think the idea that there aren't any artificial flavoring or nitrates in this beef jerky is more appealing than the taste. It is definitely an acquired taste, but once you get used to it, it isn't so bad. It'll take care of your jerky craving. Once warning of note, the bag will mold after you open it, so make sure you finish it off pretty quickly. I realized the bag of mold only after I took a bite. Didn't kill me, so now I have an immunity to something out there, just not sure what."
1,UGH - THAT AINT RIGHT,"WHAT WAS THIS - ITS DISGUSTING - ""TENDER"" BEEF JERKY? THAT'S AN OXYMORON, THE PAPAYA TENDERIZER DESTROYS THE TOUGHNESS I HAVE COME TO LOVE AND CRAVE IN BEEF JERKY - THIS HAS THE TEXTURE OF DOGGY TREATS. NOT FOR ME THANKS.."
1,WR - Leaves this Jerky Lover with a Bad Taste,"Yuk! Way overly tenderized, tiny pieces and 25% jerky dust. Can not recommend this jerky to anyone who still has their own teeth."
1,Avoid this jerky like the plague,"The jerky is the driest I have ever come across and crumbles as soon as you put it in your mouth. Taste is terrible but I guess you would have to be able to get past the texture to better judge the flavor. Even my dog doesn't like the jerky, normally his favorite treat."
2,Decent flavor with the consistency of chalk and cardboard,"I found the taste to be OK but certainly not ""wild."" The teriyaki flavor wasn't unique and didn't provide the spicy ""kick"" I was expecting. My main disappointment was with the consistency of the jerky. I'm not exaggerating when I say that it went down like cardboard and left a chalky taste in my mouth. Not a fan."
2,"Free of additives, but also free of flavor","The texture on this jerky is similar to other bad jerky, like Oberto. It's very dry, not hard but firm, and kind of falls apart in your mouth - but not in a good way. The flavor is dominated by smoke, whereas most jerkys also include soy sauce or worcestershire sauce.All in all, I'd eat this instead of stuff at the gas station like Oberto or a Slim Jim, but when push comes to shove I'll order Wild Bill's jerky, Big John's, or pick up some jerky at the local meat market."
5,One of the absolute best,"If you love British procedurals with a healthy dollop of dark humor, you are in for a rare treat. Mr. Wingfield Det.Inspector Jack Frost novels, unfortunately only 6 of them, are among the very best. In the city of Denton, product of author's imagination, people commit crimes left and right. The police is overwhelmed, especially Det. Frost. The book is very dark and gritty, but full of irresistible and irreverant humor. Mr. Wingfield Jack Frost is in many ways different than the TV version, toned down not to offend anybody. This is much richer and realistic portrayal of the plodding police work, far away from the glamor of the American TV shows with their pretty policemen."
2,easy uninspiring read,"I read this book on holidays having just read Philip Roths ""The human stain"".It is readable but repetitive and stereotypical. I enjoy the TV series but in contrast to conventional wisdom the book is disappointing in comparisonFrost comes across as a combination of Colombo and Benny Hill in a Carry on film. The characters are all cardboard cut outs and the ubiquituous bacon sandwiches ,page 3 females and viagra fired men becomes tiresome.A mindless read after a heavy book or 10 pints of lager!!"
1,Not a Fan,"This is my introduction to Jack Frost and I didn't enjoy it. Total lack of respect for women. Is this a British thing calling all females cows? A more disreputable character I would hate to meet. I can't find one good thing to say about this author. The story was way too long and left a lot of holes not filled in. Course who would have suspected 2 women, but after rounding up everyone Frost could he was bound to stumble on the actual perps. I have read many, many better mysteries. Try Anne Perry sometime. She writes about Dectectives in London too."
2,I now have three copies of After Midnight.Whoo!Hoo!,"This item is titled Broken on the cd case but is titled After Midnight on the the actual dvd.I was dupped into buying all three copies of After Midnight,two titled under different names Broken and The Document,all titled After Midnight when you watch the dvd.Of all,I would suggest The Document because it includes a cd with interviews from Amy Lee,Terry Balsamo,and Ben Moody.But if you want it for the cover art After Midnight is your best choice,there is an actual pic of Amy singing on the front,I can't tell if the eye on Broken is her's or not.I guess it's pretty cool.When I saw this item I thought I was getting new info on the band,I just cracked up laughing at myself when I relized I just bought my third copy of After Midnight!"
1,Very disappointing,"I bought this book on the strength of its good reviews and the interesting partyharvey website, but I just couldn't get into it. I tried several times, pushing grimly on from the beginning or giving another chapter a go, but it just seemed stilted and contrived. All a matter of taste, I'm sure -- so before you buy, do try to read any posted pages this book may have available."
3,A good resource for intermediate inkle weavers,"Beginners should rely on Helene Bress' book, with its more detailed instructions on how to begin. Bradley'sbasic information is only adequate, but she expands on the basics and has some interesting and useful innovations. She includes some tricks for warping and finishing ends which make the completed band look neater. Bradley also shows how to use pick-up techniques to make every letter of the alphabet, so that you can include words in your work. Illustrations consist of diagrams and black and white photos."
5,Group treatment works!,This is a great book about group treatment for adults clients! The chapters give specific examples of how group treatment programs are set up in a variety of settings. And the chapters are actually written by the people who run the programs. This book helped me set up a new group treatment program. I highly recommend it!
4,Excellent service from both sellers!,"I ordered a CD from Froggysflix, but I ordered the wrong one. They took it back with a great attitude and found me the one I wanted very quickly. Nice job!Also got a CD from FBShaw and also had a wonderful experience.You guys rock!JK"
1,Very Disappointing,"I was very disappointed with this CD. In fact, I'm going to try and return it to the store where I bought it. I suppose if you are a HUGE Doobie Brothers fan, you might enjoy it. But if you're just looking for a nice Christmas CD like I was, look elsewhere!"
5,A Truly Soulful Christmas,"This will be short and sweet--it is now September 2002 and I still listen to a number of the selections from Michaels IN THE SPIRIT--the joyfully performed GO WHERE I SEND THEE, the truly beautiful and hypnotic PEACE and the swinging WHITE CHRISTMAS--the only holiday album I have ever played all year. Mr. McDonald, as I have said numerous times before has the voice of an angel--deepening and becoming even more intense, passionate and yes ""soulful"" as he ages. A man for all seasons in the music industry and this CD as well as his others will live in my heart and many other of his fans forever. Happy Holiday in September--go and buy it now--on the internet if you can not find in any stores. Right on Brother Michael!!!"
5,Highlander The Series,Purchased this series for my sister who is a big Highlander/Adrian Paul fan. She loved it.
3,Re: Highlander Website/Prices,"Amazon.com gives a better deal on shipping, but the official Highlander website has cheaper prices overall and you even get a few bonus novelties with your order...so what's a good compromise? Try the DeepDiscountDVD website for free shipping and each series at less than $30, then if you don't want novelties you aren't forced to pay extra for them."

2,Highlander Season 2,"I purchased this item only because it was advertised as new. When the package arrived, I found that the box, while still sealed in plastic wrap, was very badly beaten up and otherwise damaged. So far I have not found any problems with the DVD's themselves, however, being a collector, the condition of the box is very important to me. Thus, I will not buy anymore DVD's or any other products of that nature from Amazon for fear of a similar occurrence."
4,Series better than movies,"Although I enjoyed the first Highlander movie, I liked the series MUCH more. Adrian Paul provided a wonderful international and timeless feel to his immortal character, Duncan McCleod. Some of the things I liked best were the guest stars playing interesting immortals (Roger Daltrey from the Who, for example), the Watcher element, and the moral dillemmas that Duncan always had to work through. Since this series involved mostly Europeans, it had a different rhythm and value set than a U.S.-centric series.I have the first season DVDs and especially enjoy the Watcher Chronicles extra. Some of the producers comments on the episodes are also quite interesting for people who like a ""Behind the Scenes"" perspective. I'm definitely looking forward to getting the second season - I remember enjoying it more than the first season."
5,Eyes of Betrayal,I really enjoyed this book. The only thing i did not like was Tate thinking his honor with the Lords was more important than being with Whit.
5,Fast moving adventure story,"Sam Mills does a great job with descriptions of the Green River Gorge. Even though I have never visited the area described I can picture it in my mind. The story is fast moving and the two brothers, Mitch and Lee, after finding money in a plastic bag in a knot hole of a tree discover that the money belongs to the mafia and they use their wits and flee via the river as the hired thugs chase them to silence them after they witness a murder by the river concerning the money. They learn quickly that the thugs are relentless and the boys are disposable despite being so young. It's a great read and packed full of surprises and action."
2,never could get into it,"Never could get into it.......maybe , I'm just not smart enough...but, I found it booring......maybe it just me....But , I wish I had my money back"
3,The money tree,I liked the story and the overall theme but it did seem to drag on and be repetitive after awhile when the boys were running from the bad guys. The end was kind of underdeveloped I thought but overall I liked the book
5,Darkstalker crash,Amazing morrigan is way more than expected I really don't like demitri he is a little deformed. But it's fun to play and kill demitri with soul fist or demetri kill morrigan with fire blade.
5,Darkstalkers Minimates,"I've always been a fan of minimates, but I usually only buy the marvel ones. I decided to mix it up and buy the darkstalkers ones. I have got to say I'm not disappointed. demitri's cape kinda gets in the way of his articulation, but its a small price to pay for these figures. morrigan really impressed me, she looks great and her wings dont hinder her movement. overall they're a must buy for fans of the game, or even fans of minimates."
2,Poorly done.,"Kai Doh Maru had a very great story line but I found that it had no real ending. My first thought was ""This must be a series!"" I did some research on the film and found no hints of it being a series. I am very dissapointed. It was short and the climax was horrible. To have got peoples attention they could have actually included Kintoki's past. There isn't much to say about it. It was a bad movie."
1,Movies should tell a story,I am a long time anime fan. This movie was one of the biggest disapointments that I have ever seen. The story line had no foundation and no structure. The climax was weak. The animation was bad. And the entire movie is only an hour long. Do not buy this movie. I.G. productions didn't put any money into this one at all.
3,Hormonal health a point of view,It is more a point of doctor's view. The nutritional and natural hormones view is rather erratic.
5,Quality and efficient,Sellers description of the product was true and accurate...arriving in excellent condition and sooner than expected. Will not hesitate to purchase from this seller in the future.
2,Just Terrible,"Perhaps they should call themselves The Festival Studio ""Orchestra"" since I can only make out a synthesizer as the primary instrument. Save your hard-earned money for something more authentic and performed by an actual orchestra."
5,Used For Years and Love It!,"I have been using this seasoning for years. The seasoning itself comes on one side of the packet and a bag for cooking the wings on the other. So this and the wings are all you have to have.The unique taste is delicious! I prefer this mild mix and eat cheese with the hot wings. And, although there aren't microwave instructions included, that is my personal favorite way of preparing them. It can vary, per microwave of course, but it can take anywhere from 13-20 minutes to cook them depending on the wattage and the size of wings. When serving to others I have found some preferred the oven method(instuctions are on the packet).I used to be able to find this in some of the dollar stores, but no more. My local grocery does have these, but the price listed here on Amazon, for the volume, saves about five dollars."
3,Horrifying crime,"Although the crime is despicable, the against-the-odds win exemplary, and the end surprising, the story felt incomplete somehow. Don't ask me to explain, cuz I'm not sure what's missing...I just feel something IS."
2,"Ordinary, when chilling would have done nicely.","Such a tragic story! Such a mediocre report of that story. Stowers plods through this book without much style or verve. Imagine the horror of a father murdering his own child for the insurance money (I'm not giving anything away, it tells you that on the book cover). I'm sure your imagination can probably render a far more touching picture than this book evokes.I think I got a clue as to what was in store when I leafed through the ""shocking photos"" bound into the middle of the volume. Eek! Wedding pictures! Oh, horror! Posed photos of district attorneys and lady police officers! Gasp! Candid shots of villain Shane Goode and his lawyer!While this book is not a total snore, it sure isn't all it's hyped up to be, either. In short, with so many books and so little time, I'd recommend you look elsewhere for excitement. Like the Halloween aisle at your local Wal-Mart."
4,"Shocking story, good book","This was a very good book about a very touching story. Left some things unanswered, but good nevertheless."
3,A Christmas Album that doesn't Stink!,ELP is one of the most tallented bands of the seventies. I love ELP and I hate christmas music. But I was happy I bought this album. They came up with some christmas music that's really cool and not very 'poppy'. If you like elp then you should buy this album.-(V)az
3,The 70's make a comeback again!,"It seems to me that when you buy a various hits copulation labeled ""2005"" you would expect to hear some new tunes from recent artists. Not the case in the Salsa world! To make money these days they have to rehash and sell you stuff they have been making since the 1970's! The majority of the album is Eddie Palmieri or someone from the Fania All Stars. Yes, you get the odd track from Hector Lavoe (Mi Gente)or a nice tune from El Gran Combo but once again I must reiterate they are all from that great salsa era of the 1970's.I rated the album with three stars becasue the music is good. But if you want better, buy the artist's album(s) and open your horizons to a world of great salsa that will surely help you get back into dancing if your not a Salsero already.I would love any feedback good or bad if someone agrees or diagress with my opinions.Jake"
1,Dissapointed,"I agree with Jake, this CD took me by surprise. Being a loyal salsa collector, I was not expecting the tunes od Eddie Palmieri & Co. on 'Salsahits 2005'. I am crazy about Salsahits 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, but this latest one is on a league of its own and doesn't match the others. I even doubted whether this one belonged in another series, and looked the CD box inside out to make sure I had bought the right one. Having said that, it is nice music, but just not what you'd expect having listened to the other Salsahits CDs.Cecilia"
3,Good overview,"For those who study actuarial/statistics this book provides good overview of characteristics of poisson, variance and standard deviations. Full of worked examples this pocket sized book is recommended by actuarial academics alike."
4,Great War Literature Comes Together,"Picking up this book I was a little naive in my thinking. I assumed that it would be an easy read, a comparative study on the effect of Great War Authors and Writings had on Modern Literature. Yet, this book was a continuous struggle, not for its dullness but by the vast amount of information that the author is able to throw at the reader. The author is without a doubt an expert on this time periods literature, his ability to find comparisons with the Modern world for me was astounding. The highest praise perhaps is that this is the kind of book that I would want to write but never could. This book is not for the lighthearted, it is better to have a knowledge of literature that has come out of the Great War but is not required. This is a book with a heart and soul, shining light on generation that is fading into the past."
1,GREAT BOOK BUT AVOID THIS TERRIBLE (ON DEMAND?) PRINTING,"This must be at $55.00 (!) (that's an exclamation point) a print-on-demand copy and to my eyes it's unreadable. My wife's eyes, too, and the cats. Of course I'm returning it and have found an edition that I trust will be *readable*--and I'm not joking about that--elsewhere. Guy named Abe. Avoid this 25th Anniversary (print-on-demand) edition. I'm going to look for a 25th Anniversary edition that *is not* print-on-demand because I want to read Fussell's 25th Anniversary Afterword. $55.00!"
2,Quite a slog!,"WW1 is a fascinating topic, but this book was written in a style for ages gone by.I mean, if you're in a trench, and all you can see is the sky, it's worth noting in maybe a paragraph or two.But the author goes on and on and on, page after bloomin' page - about the sky, and how different poets described it, and how different soldiers thought of the different poets' views of various skies - arrgggghhhh!!!!If you are under age 50, and didn't attend Oxford or Cambridge, and can read every word of this book, you might consider becoming a Zen Master!Not a good selection for most people."
3,"Good book, but the Kindle edition is poor quality","I liked the book itself, and I would probably give it more than 3 stars if I was reviewing the paper edition. But the Kindle edition that I read was very poor quality, riddled with OCR errors that were sometimes just annoying and sometimes made it hard to get the meaning.- At location 245, ""Tess of the D'Vrbervilks"" should be ""Tess of the d'Urbervilles""- At location 410, ""idée face"" should be ""idée fixe"".- At location 772, ""fie"" should be ""he"".- At location 1643, ""Jiinger"" should be ""Jünger""- At location 1684, ""In 1065"" should be ""In 1965""- At location 1833, ""from Brian W. Aldiss'sv4 Soldier Erect"" should be from Brian w. Aldiss's A Soldier Erect""- At location 1969, ""George Sberston"" should be ""George Sherston"".And so on.I recommend this book, but I recommend buying a paper copy instead of the Kindle version."
1,DONT BUY THIS BOOK,"The only reason I gave this book one star was that I couldn;t give it zero. This book was used as a classroom book for my college history on World War I. The instructure was the only person who enjoyed this piece of filth. I have never read a more collective amount of trash in my entire life. Not a single person in my class enjoyed the book, we were glad to resell it back to the college for a shallow 2.50 cents."
2,This is not a great cosmetology book,"I was disappointed when I read this book. As a cosmetology student, we were required to study this book but I found that there were so many errors and inaccuracies in it that you stopped believing what you were reading after a while and you began to question everything. A college level book, or even a high school level book for that matter,would never be accepted to be used for teaching if it contained the kinds of errors in this book, and I am talking about the book in general (not a specific version/year). Poorly written."
3,My complaints for local hairstylists,"For what the book taught hairstylists about cuts for round, and squared faces are totally wrong. If thte hair has to be styled to lift off the forehead, and come forward: All the hairstylists would do is leave bangs to the side of the client's face. Round faces should not have hair on top of hteir head. That is to crop up a spiky hairdo. To place some hair over the ears and cheeks is to make bangs on the side of the client's face. I have no idea what the editor meant by ""keep the hair up on one side."" I don't think round, and squared faces should have bangs at all."
5,If you have to take state boards this is the book you will need,"This book makes certain that you have a good understanding of the material before you take your state boards and this is very important. You probably will not have the same questions on the test, or they may be phrased differently: but the book definatly covers each chapter well!"
4,Not too bad a book,"I bought the book because I needed to know more about beauty care from head to toe. The book is very informative. I wish it could be more in depth where black hair is concerned. I have relaxed long hair that tends to get frizzy very easily and can be hard to style. I really needed to know more about that. Overall, this book is worth the price."
5,"""Unbelievable""","""Hit &amp; Run"" does for Hollywood what ""Den of Thieves"" did forWall Street. The book takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride intothe movie business, and its peculiar methods. Its a fascinating tale...how these two individuals managed to do what they did (amass huge personal fortunes) in the way they did it (a highly developed ability to self promote). In the end, Gubers and Peters managed to destroy a tremendous amount of economic value (Sony and others lost billions) while building truly large personal fortunes. Its truly an unbelievable tale. The book is well written and documented. Great entertainment value."
3,hit and miss,"Plenty of good tidbits in here and an excellent feel for the way the insane Hollywood system works. The mix of muckraking, gossiping and moralizing, however, confuses as much as it delights. It's difficult to figure out a coherent timeline (one should have been provided as an appendix), and despite the title's focus on Guber and Peters, they disappear as the tale broadens out into a vast Sony story. Part of the point is that they DIDN'T do much, but it was odd to follow them up to that point and then have Peters' fate mentioned only as one of dozens of ""where are they now?"" bits in the epilogue. Interesting, but unfocused.--J. Ruch"
5,Best kids's collection of fables and stories,"that covers practically the history of literature. Brilliant renderings of old stories; brilliant illustrations, until the 1960s when everything went ""modern,"" sketchy illustration, parading as de rigueur. Buy the whole set plus the exquisite companion books here at Amazon or at eBay. Bring your kids up with a sense of beauty, history, heroism, love of life, self-confidence and a sense of what is good in life and literature."
5,Lovely,"I bought this necklace for my son's girlfriend she was so pleased with it , wanted to get her something special so glad I bought this I am very satisfied."
5,A Great Book on Skyscrapers,Daniel Abramson is a first-class writer who beautifully handles a large and interesting subject. Hundreds of photos make the book highly accessible. The text perfectly complements the photographs. Outstanding.
2,eh,"its a nice cat, got it for a gift for someone, but i thought the legs moved. they're like sewed in, so the cat only has one pose. the one you see"
5,Wonderful cat,"Gorgeous soft cat. Great quality, super soft and huggable. I bought this cat plus two 7-inch orange tabby kittens (Wild Republic Cat Floppy Orange Tabby 7"") so my 5-yr-old daughter could have a mother cat with kittens and she loves it. She plays with them all the time -- had them for 9 months and have held up very well. Highly recommended."
5,Adorable,"Actually, we bought this adorable kitten for our aunt who is in an assisted living home. Her aged orange cat, Zip, was living there with her and recently died. She is absolutely thrilled with it. She took it out to the dining room to show her friends who used to come to visit Zip. She loves that it is so soft. A child would love it, too."
4,"Fun, but also honest and thoughtful.","Wade is NOT excited about going to a fancy school out of the neighborhood for a gifted program. But his family insists that he go, so each morning he and a girl from his school are taken across town to attend the gifted program. They are not given a royal welcome, but they are also both a bit reluctant to reach out. The realities of such a situation are clearly described. Thankfully, there is little attempt to preach a solution. Wade's uncle does mention prejudice against blacks and people from their neighborhood, but he doesn't leave out other factors. Wade does manage to reconcile himself to the circumstances and even to begin to feel more comfortable. Although he does get some support from his family, he and Dink do most of the work themselves.Good enough and real enough to hold kids' attention, but there is also enough food for thought, too."
4,Interesting,"Actually a paper or thesis, it gives some good insight into the truths around hackers, crackers, and the ""scene"" around them. The survey they undertook at H2K and DEFCON 8 gave great insight and disproved the common myths and perceptions of the hacker/cracker culture.A chapter written by Carolyn Meinel, insight and background to some of the more public ""hacker"" cases and how the scene has developed, give this a good read for anyone in Information & network security or IT for that matter. What is the beginnings of <i>2600</I>? Detailing the White, Black, and Grey hats or the scene and culture, this is a definite read."
5,Best Guide,"If you are considering going into the vending business or already in it, this is the book to get. You can save yourself a lot of time and money by following the advise that is given here. I just got into vending on a part time basis and I saved myself over $6,000 by following the authors advise.I was ready to spend about $7,500 for 20 machines from a business opportunity I found on the internet. I bought 13 machines on ebay and am placing the machines myself and I have only spent about $1,300.Thanks again Ronnie for your great easy to follow advise."
4,A little confusing,I have just started and really enjoy the book but sometimes its a little confusing. At one point it is talking about whether to buy new or used machines and it doesn't say. It talks about how you will place the machines. It also doesn't seem professionally edited. There are a lot of typos.
2,littered with math errors,This book is littered with math errors. Doesn't anyone proof read anymore? The binding broke after 3 months also. CRC ought to be ashamed. If you buy it double check everything.
1,Did not receive it,"I love the cookbook that is why I ordered another one, but the seller sent me the wrong one. My money was refunded, but I still don't have the cookbook."
2,A rather dull affair ...,"I read a lot of European mysteries & thrillers, and enjoy them for their settings outside the US. I thought I'd try one of the Inspector Ghote stories since they take place in India. Well, there are some interesting details about India's customs, countryside, politics and history, but I thought the story line was awfully dull, and ended up fast-forwarding thru the pages to get to the end. Basically the story is somebody's threatening murder with little notes, and after 195 pages you find out who. The trip from page 1 to page 195 is a plodding affair. Bah. The character of Ghote didn't seem particularly interesting, either. Keating wrote a lot of Inspector Ghote stories, but I don't think I'll try another. Probably some are better than others."
5,4 Seasons video,"Beautiful scenery and photography! Especially the way they matched the music to the sights and images. Excellently done! And the performance of Vivaldi's music is superb, as well! All in all, this is a very relaxing and gratifying experience in sight and sound. JR"
4,From a pantry of Irishness...,"...Lynch peels back his Celtic heritage, slices and dices his Catholic roots, and seasons it all with life, death and transatlantic experience. Booking Passage is a great flavorful Irish stew - mind, there's a bit of gristle in it, too!Jack Maloney, author, THE WEE MAD ROAD"
4,A delightful author,"""Booking Passage, We Irish and Americans"" is a delight. Thomas Lynch's use of language is inspiring. Lynch's observations on Irish and American life in the last three decades are full of wit and insight. This is a great book by a great author."
3,Very Informative but would appreciate a more feminist perspective.,"I love reading everything I can find on Gloria Steinem but found myself wishing she had written this herself.The information is detailed and interesting for sure. I appreciated all the research the author did about the subjects life including not only her career but her struggles with her unstable mother and mostly absent father as well as Steinem's feelings about this over her lifetime.But I got very tired of the almost obsessive way the author discussed Steinem's great appeal to men over and over and over again.I understand that another woman less attractive to the masses may have never gotten as far as Steinem and I honestly believe that is true, however, the author's constantly repeating the fact that she was attractive to men says much more about the author's perspective than it does about her amazing, brilliant and courageous subject."
4,For all those who wonder about Steinem,"A sympathetic biography of one of the most famous leaders in the women's movement. According to Heilbrun, Steinem's beauty and ability to remain constantly in the public eye have been a constant source of irritation to other feminists. She presents Steinmen as a slightly naive, well-intentioned and empathetic individual who never intended to lead the feminist movement and indeed would have preferred remaining in the shadows as a reporter and writer."
3,"Pretty pics, but NOT a guide","One can tell that the pictures were beautifully done, but there is only one pic per boat and sometimes did not show the best side of the vessel...the Chris ""barrel back"" had the rear covered by spray ! A brief paragraph with year, builder/ designer, length and beam was about it on the description. Not exhaustive, not very informative. A minature coffee table book of a very few wooden powerboats. Pics; 5 stars, organization; 5 stars, information/ completeness; 2 stars."
3,GOOD COMPILATION BRINGS BACK GOOD MEMORIES.,"3 stars you ask?...well Bananarama was a good product of the 80s with ""Venus"", ""Cruel Summer"" and ""I Can't Help It"", etc...the list goes on...of course my all time fave was ""I Heard A Rumor"".But the compilation is filled with ""filler"", songs that were not hits like ""Na Na Hey Hey"", and ""Shy Boy"", and missing songs too like ""Doctor Love"".It is a good compilation, but after you hear it a couple of times you realize this music doesn't withstand the test of time...except of course ""I Heard A Rumour"".They had their 15 minutes, now on to....Destinys Child, and others for their 15 minutes."
5,Great story!,A terrific story. I am a dog lover and have read most of Charles Lee Kelley's books ... I also live in Maine!
2,Poor Service,No one responded to my emails even though they were urgent! I tried to inquire about other shipping options... no such thing. Buy this book MONTHS in advance if you need it for studying as I received it too late for what I needed it for. Bummer. Too bad you cant get this book elsewhere.
1,Waist of Money,"this product is a total waist of my money after using it a few mornings I noticed that the middle of my back now aches me, it actually makes my back feel soar, i would not recommend this to anyone plus it does nothing to your abs.......waist of my hard earned money :("
4,Great product! Good for your back and abs!,I have had this product for about 2 weeks. I have noticed that my abs changing from fat to muscle. I have a history of low back problems as well and have noticed that this product does help with reducing my back pain. I use the machine 7 days a week and do at least 100 sets per day. The only thing I think that could be better is the head rest. It needs to be a little thicker padding. I slide a small pillow behind my head and that works fine.
4,happy,It has helped my back out. I use it one a week and I must say it feels great. I pick kids up all day so to bend my back the other direction after work feels AMAZING!
3,"nice stretch, too low to the ground","I was kind of disappointed after putting it together, didn't seem like much. I started using it and found that it does give a good stretch to the spinal area. The only flaw I see is that it way to low to the ground, needs to be raised up to about seat level."
3,its ok,the box had been opened and the item had been used and returned.all packages were opened and parts missing.not fond of brookstone policies.as far as the item i have used it everyday day.can't say i look any better in 30 days but it feels good on the back and abs
2,It's a pain in the neck!,"We've had this device for a couple of weeks and I have my doubts as to its ability in firming abs. It does a good job of stretching the back, but in doing so, wreaks havoc on my neck and makes me feel like I've been on a roller coaster. It does not come with much instruction and I have attempted to try it several different ways including adding more support for my neck. I am about 5' 4"", so perhaps this device is simply not built for me. My son, who is 6' uses it to stretch his back and the frame fit seems more suited to his size."
3,Disappointed,I purchased this item to help with back pain. I have been using it now for several weeks and have noticed no improvement.
4,Ab Stretcher delivers,"This product was easy to assemble, is smaller than many ab contraptions and really stretches out my back. The only issue I have is the seat is small and not very comfortable -- I added a pillow!"
2,This is not an Abdominal Machine,"I purchased this machine from Brookstone, and I was disappointed when I put it together. Though it is well built and sturdy, its main purpose is to stretch your back. If you are purchasing it for that purpose only then I highly recommend this product.. If you think you are getting the best bang for your buck by getting a combination of the two.. think again... Go with the Ab Rocket. It works the abs efficiently and concentrates in that area. This machine is solely for your back and I think they should take that off the product title."
4,"I really like this , but...","I received this three days ago, and really like it. Besides stretching the back--it gives the abs a good workout, and I think it also works the butt area. Also it doesn't slide around.--The only problem I have with it--is it takes me a minute or two to get comfortable enough to lean back on it. The steal between the foam hits my back wrong. After I am comfortable--then it is fine. I think I am going to look for some foam, and put some in the middle. If not for that--I would give it 5 stars.It's a keeper.Billie"
3,Back Stretcher,"Item was purchased initially for my husband with postural kyphosis, a common condition of a curvature of the upper (thoracic) spine, to help stretch and loosen the upper spine and relief some minor back pain. He is using it daily with positive results. I have found myself utilizing the stretcher as well to help regain some of my natural posture and as a fitness tool to strengthen my core muscles (upper legs, abdomen and back). My one complaint is the head rest, although adjustable, does not adjust low enough for my comfort. Overall, we are satisfied."
1,I don't recommend this book.,I am well acquainted with witchcraft and magic. This book is a compilation of other books and these authors purposely rendered the magical works inoperable. Don't waste your money on this book.
3,Very interesting.,I love all of these amazon reviewers who write such detailed and in depth reviews for this one book and then never use their accounts again. This book must really be special.
1,An insult to the original artists,A one star rating is too high! The singers covering the old classic music on this CD are so bad it's an insult to the great artists that originally cut these classic songs. Keep far away from albums like this that do not include ALL of the original artists.
4,My 16 year-old migraineur highly recommends!,"I bought this book at the recommendation of a friend for my 16 year-old daughter, who has suffered from regular migraines for years. Brilliant but impatient, she spends more time online than reading, so I didn't know how she would receive it. She read this book quickly and thought it was fantastic. She rates it ""4.5"" but rounded to 4 rather than 5 because she ""would rarely give any book a 5."""
3,An okay overview of the types of migraine,"This is a pretty good review of the varieties of migraines and the various symptoms people experience.However, it does not actually explain the physiology of migraine; the actual cause of migraine.It was interesting, but didn't really provide any answers, just descriptions."
3,Olive Sacks' Migraine is great as always,"Like his other books, Oliver Sacks has done a great job of taking a clinical perspective of a medical condition and making it understandable and accessible to people not familiar with medical jargon."
4,"The more up-to-date a migraine book, the less space given to the aura","Sacks wrote in this book that the more up-to-date a book aboutmigraine, the less space it is given to the neurological conditionscalled the aura. This statement is still true, and yes, I agree withsome of the other reviewers, Sacks book is not really up-to-date. ButSacks at least devoted a large part of this monograph to illustratingthe varied presentations of visual auras, e.g. a selection of 13images from the Migraine Art collection. Beside the visual aura manymore neurological symptoms are described. Given that migraines arefrequently misdiagnosed due to the strange symptoms, the focus on theaura alone makes this book worth buying. It open up to many people,not just the migraine sufferers, the fascinating world of brain function(and unfortunately dysfunction), as do all the other wonderfull booksfrom Sacks."
3,The study of migraine,"This was a tough book to rank. If you suffer from migraines or treat patients with migraines, you will probably think this book worthy of a ranking of 10. If you are a general reader, you will be bored by the dry discussion and rank this book a 1 or 2. Sacks is thorough, if nothing else, and has updated this book twice (1985 and 1992) to enhance it's accuracy and helpfulness. From Sacks's thoughtful discussion, one certainly learns that 'migraine' is far more than a headache. Sacks has intentionally kept the form of the book clinical, and in this sense it is different from his other books in that he does not write for the general reader. As a physician who doesn't ordinarily deal with migraine in my practice, I vacillated between interest and boredom while reading this book."
2,Not useful,"This book is filled with historical information. However, it is woefully out of date. Dr. Sacks says there is no definitive treatment of migraine. Sumatriptan is mentioned briefly. The triptans are the definitive treatments for migraine.Dr. Sacks gets totally wound up in proving how erudite he is. The migraine sufferer can find much better information by checking with modern neurologists."
3,"If you have migraines, please consider this book.","If you have migraines, please consider this book. It is more difficult to read than most of Oliver Sacks' other books. However, Dr. Sack does list many symptoms of migraines that are not available to the general public."
4,good basic information on migraines,exactly the information i was generally looking for - some of the treatment modalities are dated. The drawings were excellent.
4,turbo IV alternate hose,this hose really improves the versatility of the turbo IV vacuum as it is 16 feet long and smaller than the standard hose making it ( the vacuum ) easier to use.
3,Concise Lexicon review,"Although I am really impressed with the extent of this lexicon I do have one problem with it. It appears to be copied on inferior equipment. I understand the need for smaller type, but because of weak print, some of the words are hard to read. Also; because of the smaller print, many of the vowel points are almost invisible."
3,Less than expected,I thought the book didn't offer as much as I had expected that it would. A CONCISE LECXICON TO THE BIBLICAL LANGUAGES
4,dora building set,"My 3 yr old loves this item. She can make many different scenes using the parts and the picture card,but mostly she just does what she wants with the pieces. Allows her to create her own backyard adventures and stories. Was a bit pricey but has lots of uses."
4,Our Granddaughter loves it!,"Our Granddaughter, who is 4, loves Dora. Since this has several configurations, it stimulates her creative juices."
3,"Good for Dora fans, but not sturdy enough","I got this for my 2 year old son for Christmas. He loves Dora the Explorer, and he loves ""houses"", so I figured he'd enjoy this toy. He does like it, but the key problem is that it's not sturdy at all. It's more like Legos, so an adult must first build the house. It doesn't stay together very well at all though, so more often than not it's in pieces in his bedroom. I like the idea, and the price is good, but it's probably better for a 3 or 4 year old Dora fan."
1,Mega Bouncer,"Wow! What a disappointment! It says it's an 8ft high jumper...I'm 5'8"" and this jumper comes to my chest. There is maybe 5ft X 5ft of jumping space. My 5 year old was in it for a few minutes and was jumping away and almost knocked it over. I will be sending this one back. Good thing I opened it now instead of waiting till the bday party."
3,Boring and has little bounce,"Got this for toddlers. It is not real springy so they got bored with it quickly. It seems well made but the velcro door to get in and out was a bad design idea. A larger door with snaps or ties would work much better and still be safe. It is disappointing to watch the kids try to comfortably get in and out of this thing. I fill it with balls and soft toys to try and make it more fun, but it isn't getting much use here."
3,Alternative Arrangements,This CD might prove interesting to those bored with traditional arrangements. Not a sing along given unusual variations on traditional melodies. Keep you hand on the volume control - mix is quite variable.
5,GRE!!? Looking for the best thesaurus? Look no further!,"I have, like some of my overzealous opposite numbers, gone overboard by going into a spree of pre test consumerism esp. that of books related to GRE. I have bought nearly 4 different thesauri but Barlett's Roget's thesaurus surpasses them all. For example: Crabbed which basically means irratible, ill tempered, spiteful, cranky, pettish, etc. Now, if you search for the meaning of crabbed in merriam websters dictionary (the best available on the planet) it will spit out the meaning as sour or peevish (irratible). But if you try to search for the synonyms list for the word crabbish, no other thesauri, in which happened i happened to check, except Barletts Rogets, had irritable as a synonym in its synonym list for the headword - crabbing. This is one of the several examples which have enraged me enough to discard my various other thesauri in favor of Barletts Rogets Thesaurus."
5,Traditional Thesaurus at its Best,"I was sick of all the thesauruses in my office that are set up in dictionary-alphabetic format and turned to Amazon for the traditional concept-based thesaurus of my youth. I got it with ""Bartlett's Roget's Thesaurus.""The indexing alone is well worth the money you'll pay for this, but if that's not enough, you might like the list of categories, (will and behaivior, spatial relations, negotiations & fiscal relations, etc.) that are included both by concepts and alphabetically. In addition, there are a lot of lists included, from breeds of cattle to stations of the cross to varieties of beans. Makes for some interesting reading.If *that* hasn't convinced you, the actual thesaurus part of it is darn good. Many times I turn to this reference book to prompt creativity, to expand on ideas, etc. The contemporary terms and phrases and relationships between words and concepts are quite good. If you appreciate good resources, this is going to be a great desk item for you."
5,a splurge ...,"but it is worth it. This is a retrospective book of sorts, and has a good selection of Nixon's past and current projects, which include city scapes, pictures of people, family pictures, old people, couples, and the Brown Sisters. The layout is great (especially the treatment of the Brown Sisters project) and the reproductions are beautiful."
2,"Every note is perfect, but.........","Tierney Sutton has a shimmering, bell-like quality to her voice. After a while, however, you realize that it's all a little bit bloodless, even cold.Jazz singing is not opera. If it were, Tierney would be be the reigning queen, given the purity and richness of her instrument. However, it is almost as if the the purity of her voice, and the unremitting accuracy of her intonation, are impediments that keep her from conveying the emotional content of the songs she performs.Unfortunately, for Tierney, the whole is LESS than the sum of the parts."
3,Okay...,"Nothing earthshattering, but nothing to complain about either. I'm lukewarm, what can I say on this one..."
1,NO SOUL HERE,I have all her other cds I especially love Unsung Heroes there is a vibe to that cd that gets u right in but with this one its like shes just tryin far toooo hard to be good....Sure the technique is spot on but THERE IS NO SOUL the emotion is missing...for me I like my jazz vocals with feeling. I like the singer to take u on a journey deep into to the song. u wont get that here all u will get is technique...
3,On second thought this cd is pretty good,"I have several of Tierneys' cds and there seems to be a common thread that runs through all of her cds. That thread is scatting. Tiereny really likes to scat. This is alright if this is your thing, but for me it is offensive. I have never been a scat fan.Well, I have good news. I'm an engineer and I have all the software to record music and even alter recordings to fit my need. In the case of this cd I was able to successfully take out the scatting that was offensive to me. Now this cd is cool like the title suggests.I would like to recommend my version of this cd, but not the original version. There is one catch however, my version of this cd is not for sale. It's my private copy only. Sorry!"
5,Bewley's is the best,"While in Ireland last summer, I drank Bewley's tea at the B&B; in Kilkenny and bought a box at Dunne's to bring home. Those bags ran out long ago, so I ordered some online. Drinking Bewley's is like being back in Eire, walking in the garden smelling the lavender and loam. As soon as you drop the bag in the hot water, it begins to swirl a rich, dark brown, and in only a minute you have a wonderful cup of aromatic, flavorful tea.I've ordered from Bewley's before - hampers last time - and have not been disappointed. I was glad I could order though Amazon [...]. At last, I've found a place where I can order black pudding. If you want a taste of Ireland, get some Bewley's."
1,Don't Trust Chiba Sports,These look like nice gloves. Chiba Sports did not deliver my order and will not respond to my email. Don't do business with Chiba Sports.
4,SOLID NEO PROG,"AFTER LISTENING TO THE HORRIBLE NEW DEEP PURPLE CD, I HAVE DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE MAINLY ON PROGRESSIVE BANDS. I DID THIS BECAUSE THIS CD REMINDED ME THAT ROCK IS PRETTY MUCH DEAD AND FOSSILIZED AND STAGNANT WHEN YOU MIX IN BLUES. ILUVATAR IS A BAND THAT RE-CREATED A SOUND THAT I SO ADMIRE THAT BORROWS FROM ROCK AND CLASSICAL MOTIFFS. THE END RESULT IS JOY TO THESE EARS. SADLY, THIS BAND HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE SCENE. TOO BAD SOME OTHER BANDS DON'T JUST CALL IT A DAY."
4,Beguiling book.,"A young man, Richard Lippman goes to university in Montreal in the 1940's but before he gets there his uncle introduces him to Lili L'Amour after watching her dance naked at the Gayety Theatre. Lili is kind to Richard and even gives him the pasty off her left breast. Later that evening as he lies alone he looks at that pasty and decides to write a poem about Lili. So begins an intriguing and electric relationship between the two. Richard writes the poems to which Lili dances. She is a legendary performer often compared to Isadora Duncan.I liked Richard a lot. He's a lovable, intelligent romantic lead in the dance that leads him to manhood.This is the first time I've read Weintraub and his even tempo and enchanting story telling are enough to lure me to read more of his work."
2,Dr What......,The quality of this video is awful. I could barley hear it and the subtitles go by so fast I had to keep pausing the dvd in order to read them. Also the movie itself did not make any sense. I know that translating from one language to another can be difficult but I find it hard to believe they would say such foolish things. Half the sentences did not make any sense. I know it is one of Jet Li's first movies and as such it stinks! I couldn't even enjoy his skills as a martial arts expert. I looooove Jet Li but I disliked this purchase very much (I will not use the H word on Jet Li) Save your money folks I'll give you mine!!!N.
5,Probably excellent.,"Okay, I haven't actually read this book. I have, however, viewed the Ed Thigpen brush video (twice), and since it is easily the best and most informative music video I've ever seen, it seems very likely to me that this book will also be very, very helpful.Just for the record, the brush sweep should be notated thus: Draw a horizontal line replacing the note head in the E (what would be E if this were bass clef, that is) snare space with a slur to show that brush is not lifted. Two brushes on the snare require alternate stem direction."
5,The Santa ClausE,"Living in Florida I truly miss the real feeling of Christmas and the holidays. Seeing the snow filled streets, the Christmas lights on homes and of course going to the North Pole helps remind me of some really great Christmases and Christmas wishes. Full of the holiday spirit."
4,Cute movie!,"Not as great as I remembered as a kid, but my 7 year old liked it! I would definitely rent it in HD verses standard."
2,ok the movie I love but it was my first try at buying a prime moive it's prime I had trouble with,"so it locked up 3 times in the first 5 minutes so I bought Christmas with the kranks and it worked fine! So I know it wasn't me or the computer but the sad part was that shortly after watching Christmas with the Kracks we lost power here for 2 and 1/2 days so I paid for this movie and didn't get to see it! bummer, love tim Allen movies!"
5,Love Christmas movies,"I simply love Christmas movies. This movie is one of them. I can watch it over and over, any time of the year!"
4,pretty good movie,"This movie is definitely better than the sequels. It's still a little cheesy, but it has it's moments. If you have nothing to watch and you are in a christmassy mood, this movie should do the trick."
3,Big Screen Big Break for Tim Allen,"This movie established Tim Allen's ability to draw family audiences to the big screen. As perennial holiday fare, it's OK, but it's kind of a ""'tweener"" -- not slick enough to compete with the huge box office extravaganzas (think Grinch), not sweet or sincere enough to rank with the Home Alones. The first part of the flick works better, when Allen's wry humor and sarcasm put a different spin on the traditional Santa Claus fable. It does work equally well for kids and adults."
3,"Good movie, poor DVD","This is a cute movie. I have always enjoyed it. But, I DID NOT like the price for a DVD with NO EXTRAS!!!!"
4,Love this movie come holiday season,I watched this movie as a child and it brings me back to watch it again with my family. Love it!
5,Classic,Warm hearted classic for me. Always enjoy good natured fun and loving ending. Recommended for the young and old alike.
3,It's fun and funny but it's not a great film,"A good christmas film but it's not the best christmas movie. The movie is about a man who is divorced and his son spends christmas with him. The son is starting not to believe in Santa Clause, then by accident the father becomes Snata. Ok it's hard to explain but I bet everyone has seen this movie. I liked it I found it was funny espesially when they get the gifts at the ed liek mystery date it put a smile on my face. But I did not like the kid I found him to spoiled and bratty for example he always trys to make his father look bad by saying you dont do anything I want to do and please dad and then he gets mad. I found the story good but it left lots of loose end. I dont like to watch this every christmas but it is a good christmas film. it was followed by a dreadfulls equal The Santa Clause 2 and A third movie is to be relesed in 2006."
2,how many people wrote the script?,"about halfway through this film i started to wonder if the scriptwriter gave their pages over to a stand-in...what starts out as perfectly good story with plenty of adventure and comedy soon gives way to inconsistency and jumpy scenes...ever notice how some sequels artifically play up to the original? this movie does it to itself...i loved the first half, but the rest is just trite..."
1,Heh Heh Heh...,"Ever since that Micheal Eisner guy took over, Disney has been trying to make movies that appeals to both adults and kids. This is not working and Eisner need to get that through his stupid, ugly, deformed, thick head. Now onto the review. Despite the PG rating, little kids wouldn't be able to understand the hidden adult jokes like when Tim Allen tells the little 10 year old elf girl ""you look good for your age."" I believe this is rather unusual but what's more unusual is every elf in the movie are little kids working at Santa's workshop. I don't know if anyone's noticed, but this is rather similiar to child labor. Another thing, why does Disney promote Santa so much? Don't tell me because it's Christmas, I know that. What I do know is there are more things to Christmas and Disney is making it look like it's all about Santa."
1,never wanna see it again,"this movie has a FEW good and funny parts BUT . . .it's lame. i really don't like seeing elves, and santa in the north pole. its' just . . .WICKED! if you're 2 yrs. old, ya might like it--its colorful and strange."
5,santa clause- how he got the suit,tim allen at his best in no less than another comedy. the thing is he was not planning on this episode taking him up and away to the north pole. but when called into action he finally makes the deliveriesA+++++
5,The Santa Clause(Widescreen Special Edition),"""The Santa Clause"" will always be my favorite of these movies. I can't believe it now, but at first I didn't think I wanted to see it before I finally did. Then I saw it on TV and found out how lovable it is.I recommend it to all Tim Allen fans and anyone who enjoys a good Christmas movie.Now I own copies of all 3 movies on DVD, although that may be overdoing it.I don't know when I'll watch all my Christmas movies ,but I do really enjoy all 3 of these."
4,A Christmas Classic,I remember seeing this in theatres as little girl and think it should be the next Christmas Classic. I will watch it every year with my family.
3,Special Edition coming!,For those of us who love this movie though the dvd is lacking in extras there is still hope. A Special Edition will be released this summer in 2002! It's worth the wait!
3,it was my fault,"i didnt read this very well when i was looking through it when i was ordering, didnt realize it was a vhs till it got here. dont own a vhs player. never got to use it. sold at garage sale. bummer."
5,Es buenisima,Esta pelicula realmente engancha porque es buenisima. Otra forma de disfrutar la navidad junto a la familia. Vale la pena tenerla en la colección de DVD's.
1,"Bah, humbug",This movie bored me. I felt it dragged along. The dialog was lifeless and I had no interest in the characters. I will not be adding it to my list of Christmas favorites.
5,great movie,I haven't seen this movie since I was a teenager and have forgotten how funny it is. It's heartwarming and a holiday classic for sure
5,kids love it,Both of my kids said this is one of their all time favorite movies. They were bummed it was only for24 hours.
4,One of my Favorite Christmas Movies!,"I watch this every year at Christmas time, sometimes twice. There's something magical about the story. The scene where Charlie is crying and says I love you Santa Clause gets me every time. Love love love this movie!"
5,Believing is seeing,"To quote an elf in the movie, ""Seeing isn't believing. Believing is seeing."" This is a wonderful funny, yet touching Holiday comedy. Adults will enjoy the jokes poking fun at the adult characters. Kids will delight in the magic and getting their ""How does Santa do that?"" questions answered. If you can imagine the movie ""Prancer"" with a comedic touch that's the closest I can come to a comparable. Tim Allen is amazing in this role. My kids have even made their own North Pole door sign and practice flying their reindeer after only one viewing! Don't miss this one."
4,Sweet and entertaining,"The Santa Clause is a sweet, heartwarming tale that takes one back to the innocent wonder of childhood. Tim Allen plays a divorced father who wants his son to continue believing in Santa. He gets sucked into being the new Santa. This is a story about faith, about believing in something you can't see or that doesn't seem plausible. It is a good antidote if the commercial aspects of this holiday have you down and will provide you an entertaining couple of hours."
1,Lost ability to watch on Christmas Eve,We loved the movie. Upset because we couldn't watch it on Christmas Eve as planned because Amazons service was interrupted.
4,A few words about The Santa Clause,I just bought the Santa Clause mostly because I think it is a funny Christmas movie that I will enjoy. When I first went on Amazon to buy the movie I typed the title in and a lot of results came up. I clicked on the widescreen special edition and looked at it in a picture at the bottom. I noticed that in the picture of the box the cover of the movie sparkled. I thought it was so pretty and I like the movie so I decided to buy it. Well about 5 days later I get it in the mail and I open my package and notice that the cover of the movie doesn't sparkle. I am so disappointed because I feel like the pictures up on Amazon are very misleading I thought I was getting one thing and I got something else. I thought I would just share this with people so they know before the buy. Even though I am disappointed about the box I am happy to finally own the DVD.
4,"Love the movie, good price",Not much to say in a review of the movie. Amazon had a good price on the movie so I bought it for Christmas.
4,Be careful what you sign onto,"A beautiful Christmas movie, but one for which you must suspend disbelief. In part, it is the story of a man who changes his value system from selfish and materialistic to one of kindness and generosity."
4,Great holiday movie,"For a family movie, this is a fun, funny film that doesn't get into the syrup-sweet territory some holiday movies fall into. We watch it every year."
5,THUMBS UP FOR ALL HOLIDAY FILMS!!!!!!,This has gotta to be one of the most hilarious Christmas films since 1990's Home Alone and 1992's Home Alone 2: Lost in New York They put this every year before December on ABC for the Wonderful World of Disney Luckly I have it on video so I can watch it anytime I want hey maybe tomorrow I might watch it again hey I heard on the interent they're doing a sequel for 2002 next December neat huh I really recommend you get this Tim Allen is a Riot in this film please get it makes you get into the holiday spirit right away:)))))))))))Way Happy
5,great family film,"this is a great movie, tim allen is perfect in his role. i first saw this movie when it came out in the theaters when i was about 11 or 10, and i'm 16 now and i still enjoy watching it every holiday with my family. It's something everyone can enjoy. It's not a classic like A Christmas Story or Charlie Brown's Christmas, but it's worth watching!!"
5,Perfect Christmas movie,"We bought this movie to watch at Christmas because the kids love it. I enjoyed it, we do every year."
2,DVD,I thought I would get a DVD. I would like to have a DVD so I could use it on a player for my kids.
3,"So , so!!","This movie was ok. Just alittle bit on the corney side. If you have very young children, they will appreciate it."
4,Cute movie.,"Our boys think their daddy is Santa Claus... well, he is in this house! An enjoyable and funny ""classic"". You won't be disappionted."
4,Santa Claus movie,I really enjoyed this movie because it shows that no matter what age who are its never too late to believe in Santa Claus. Tim Allen makes a great Santa Claus.
5,santa clause dvd,"thank you for a wonderful purchase, movie arrived in great condition, very fast shipping, thanks again!!!!!"
5,Best Santa Clause Movie Ever Made...,this is by far the best santa clause movie ever made and it's all thanks to tim allen and disney. tim allen is excellent. this movie is great. i recommend it to everyone
3,This could have been better,"The story of a divorced dad pressed into Santa duty after the previous one takes a header off the roof is, in Disney's hands, a fairly predictable outing. There are flashes, however, of what the movie could have been--many of the scenes at the North Pole with the elves are pretty funny, and Tim Allen does a great job. I did, however, long to smack the kid playing Allen's son--pretty much all he does is whine. The standout scene for me is a small dance sequence set to (of all things) ZZ Top's ""Gimme All Your Lovin'"" featuring Allen and the elves--they even do moves that were in the video! Overall, not a bad one to haul out at the holidays, but there's really nothing here that hasn't been done before."
2,Dull and old,Boring only kept watching because of the kids .... Don't bother to rent I thought it was more entertaining than most new movies out now though
5,Great movie!,Fun for whole family. One of a small number of Christmas movies we'll watch several times during the holiday season.
5,Love it!,"I love love love Christmas movie and it was a great price! So wonderful purchase, glad I got it. Thanks!"
5,My favorite Christmas movie,"I have netflix, but the wait time for this movie was listed as very, very long wait, so I just went on over to Amazon to see what could be done, and there it was, available for instant rental, with no wait."
2,Dinner Fork dimensions,"The description says the fork is 7 1/2 inches, which is the size I already have. The fork arrived as an 8 inch larger ""Place Fork"" which is overall larger than my original set. I returned it asking for the 7 1/2 inch fork, and once again received the 8 inch larger one. Would appreciate having the description changed if the Place Fork is the only one now available."
3,Live Karaoke from...?,"My ghod, this is a strange piece of work. Oval is more normally known for their strange deconstructions of sound, building bits and pieces of other smashed-up sounds into weird, often-repetitive tapestries somewhere left of Aphex Twin and right of Carl Stone. But on here, we get the odd 'wrecked CD player' Oval sound along with low-key loungey vocals in German, some drums, and the results are like a weird karaoke lounge tape as mis-filtered through some experimental music lab. Oval can be a little difficult for some, but this is difficult even for Oval. Still, _I_ sort of like it, if only for the weirdness factor present here. But to be sure, this is something of a misfire on Oval's part, and not wholly representative of their otherwise interesting and challenging output. One for the completists, as well as those into 'strange music'."
3,Whoah!...Vocals? Drum beats?...This is not the Oval I know.,"There are German vocals on a lot of these songs. This album is really nothing like other Oval releases, it is much more melodic. There really aren't any soundscapes at all...this is techno music. There are still a lot of digital cd distortions which are very much like the sounds on Dok and Systemich but, they are sequenced with strong rhythms....it is wierd. I like thier other work alot more."
4,different and worthy!,"True, Wohnton is very different from all other Oval albums. Actually, it's not like any other CD I've ever come across. But it's also a very *good* CD!A bizarre mix of oval glitches with a peculiar (and humorously almost off key) vocalist and some lazy drums. I don't know how to describe much better since I can't think of anything to compare it to.If you like Oval, I would still recommend this. Just be cautious, because not all of Oval's fans will care about this under-rated release."
5,"Maybe not what you expect, but great!","Most people picking this up will be familiar w/ Oval's more recent work of sparse code generated rythems, or slightly earlier ""skipping disc"" collages. Whonton, in my opinion is the best Oval disc to date, but it's so different maybe it shouldn't be considered a true Oval offering. Yes, there is a german crooner. Yes, he quite often is off key. But his crooning strangely works to tie together the otherwise classic disjointed Oval sound into pretty traditional melodies! Try as I might to explain this wonderful disc, you've just got to hear it yourself."
2,Vocals+Oval=Mess,It a shame to see the experimental techno talent of Oval wasted over much of this confusing recording. The only thing less comercially viable then Oval's intrigung conceptual musical styles is the inane German vocals which awkwardly accompany more than two thirds of this discs tracks. Outside of Track #2 file the rest of this album away for extreme Oval fans only.
4,Very Pretty!,"These are very pretty earrings. Setting is sturdy and well made; prongs are secure. Backs fit tightly. Stones have a nicely matched, good, bright color with sparkle. Heart shape of stones is well-defined, but one stone was not cut quite as well (a little crooked on top). I paid about $35. I would buy these again."
1,"Dry, dull, and a terrible user interface","My toddler likes it. Her older brother hated it when he was of the appropriate age. But this adult finds it deadly dull to the point of painful. It's the only video of Thomas tank we ever bought, and it will be the last.The DVD user interface is inexcusable. You have to sit through a LONG introduction before it lets you make a selection. The first time might be cute, the 50th time is enough to put a harried parent over the edge. If you pick the music, you don't get music, you get another menu screen requiring another button to be pressed. When the DVD is done, it defaults to some meaningless screen, not the menu page. To me, the lack of user-friendly interface is a deal breaker."
3,Good DVD,My 2 year old thinks it is a great show. And I don't mind him watching Thomas during tv time
5,Revisiting Dr. Williams,"Delightful, anecdotal, touching remembrances of the premiere American modernist poet by the premiere American modernist publisher. More conversation than dissertation, the slim book consists of a single light, often rambling but highly readable poem. It's a must-read for any devotee of Williams and provides great insight into the relationship that fostered and nutured the development of New Directions. Also includes Paterson-like snippets of prose as well as Kenneth Rexroth's moving farewell poem to Dr. Williams."
5,butter knife,I purchased this piece to coordinate w/a sugar spoon. It is beautiful and a great quality. It has a nice weight to it. Oneida is a great brand
3,Solid but unremarkable all-star meeting,"This is one of the more unremarkable and bland Cannonball albums I've heard. It was his first recording with Victor Feldman, who would briefly take over the group's piano seat until Joe Zawinul's arrival, and also features one of only two recorded appearances Cannonball made with the legendary guitarist Wes Montgomery.The music itself is fairly standard late 50s/early 60s Cannonball. There aren't a lot of recordings of Cannonball playing Bird during the 60s, so this version of ""Au Privave"" is somewhat noteworthy. Feldman's ""Azule Serape"" gets a better read on the Live at the Lighthouse LP from later in 1960. The highlight of the album is the closer, a very nice +8 minute, briskly swinging ""Never Will I Marry"".Those who are less lukewarm on Wes Montgomery than me will probably have a greater appreciation for this album, but there are at least three or four other Cannonball albums from the 1959-1960 period that I would recommend first."
4,the KING of all of boarder music,"THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF HIS BEST WORKS. IT TIES HIS CLASSIC SOUND WITH ""CASAS DE MADERA"" AND HIS NEW APPROACH WITH ""SOLO UNA PATADA"" THOUGH THE SECOND SONG IS THE ONE OF MOST LIKED BY MANY PEOPLE I TRULLY FEEL THAT THE SYNTHESIZER SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE TEJANO MUSICIANS. SO BECAUSE OF THIS I DO TAKE ONE STAR OFF. THOUGH I AM A LOYAL FAN THAT HAS MORE THEN 15 CD FROM THE UNITED STATES AND FROM MEXICO."
5,bluesmama,"Based on the true life of Sean and Sheila Cloney, this is a beatiful story of love, family, and friendship being torn apart by blind prejudice and religious bigotry. It's a courageous story that will make you think, make you cry, make you smile, and make you cheer. A must-see and one of my favorite movies."
5,Let me say he's the best,"This book is absolutely awsome. It made me enjoy every single single page I read, and I actually read it twice. Why living everybody on the same days at the same time? Here is a nice solution to the population explosion problem. In each day of the week only 1/7 of the population will live. But what heppens when someone want to live out of his day ? If U want to do a day-brake, then you need difrent identity in each day. Can anyone be 7 difrent peoples at once ? I guess so, I suggest to read this book, though.Read it, it's fun.Read it, it's very smart."
4,Right-wing propaganda,"This book gives a disturbing look at the agenda of the far right. Frum shows courage is his ability not to sugar coat the far right's message but state it as it is. He often smacks of racism using such terms as ""black"" and ""underclass"" virtually interchangably. Frum advocates stopping immigration because he believes America is risking ""cultural suicide."" More disturbing is his vision of a good society. Frum endorses reinstating social stigmas against homosexuality, children born out of wedlock, single unmarried women and premarital sex. He openly admits that would like to see a more religious society for the secular reason that it would be a better behaved society. Frum himself does not come off as a religious man himself but as one who promotes Christianity for the purpose of controlling people. Frum's vision of society is disturbing but at the same time refreshing. He proves that the far right is guilty of elitist politics liberals have been accusing them of for years."
2,Severely dissapointed...,"I bought this in hopes that i would be able to hook it up to my pc and play console games... it worked!.... sortof. The card is apparently too slow. Press jump, jump a second later. So i unplugged my system and then i plugged the cable in. It was kindof blurry. Not terribly, but enough to dissapoint me even more. I expected far better from ati...It works alright so long as you use dscaler [...]Sad you have to use a third party application to get this hardware to work."
1,Good waste of my hardly earned money,ATI is a decent company. I can't imagine they dare to market a piece of junk like this. The software just doesn't work! Hello?Can you find some competent software developers? or you just want screw the customer!Worst experience ever !!!
1,A terrible waste of time/effort,"Once again ATI drops the ball. Being pretty handy with a computer I figured I could get this installed and running in no time. Having had problems with ATI before I double checked the system requirements on the side of the box just to be safe and everything looked good. I get it home check my drivers and install this little ""gem"". Heres where it earns its one star. The video looks very good, however no sound. I already knew that ATI's customer service department was lacking (and surprise no help once again!)and after spending several hours checking drivers and reinstalling I've decided to return it. Please people read reviews (lots of them!) before buying a card for your computer. My system requirements should of made this a slam dunk but ATI's inciompatability probelems rear their ugly head again!"
2,Same problem (Why I didn't red the reviews before bought it),"I had the worst 2 day of my life trying this #$%$& card work.The quality is so poor and I tried to fix everything. Finally, reading the reviews I realized that it's not an installation or a computer problem, it's a product problem and an incomplete description from ATI for the system requirements.BIG BIG DISAPPOINTMENT."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!,"i do r&d;, testing & technical support for a software company. i bought this card because it was inexpensive, but i sure got what i paid for. the bundled sofware is terrible, and i had to download updated drivers and software several times from ati.com befpre i could get their updates to actually install on my machine. and i don't even want to get into how buggy their multimedia center is. plus, i had to call technical support to resolve video and audio issues, which were never solved. then, finally, it crashed my computer.even after i pulled the card out and uninstalled the drivers, even running their software removal utility, the remnants of their software is causing problems on my machine. if i am a computer professional and having this much trouble with it, i would hate to see the kind of frustration this causes the average joe who buys it.terrible product."
1,"bad, bad, bad","the installation software and manual that came with it were extremely unhelpful, and wouldn't actually install anything, so I had to find newer software on their website. Finally got it working and it has bad, flickering video quality. A day wasted trying to get it to work right."
2,Something...,I was looking for a video that contained some trippy images but this really wasn't what I had in mind. It was trippy but seems a little past it's time. Had alot of old computer generated animations that seems hokey by today's standards.
3,Just OK,These earrings are pretty but quite small - appropriate for a young child. I expected more for the price. Packaging for presentation was quite cheap.
2,14k yellow gold peridot studs,I was really disappointed with these earrings. The flat surface on the earrings are different sizes so they don't look right when you wear them. One area is large and the other one is small. The color is nice. I am probably going to return them.
4,peridot earrings,Very pretty. The shade of green is perfect. I would recommend them to anyone looking for an August birthday gift. I wear them and they are comfy.
4,My thoughts,"I like the earrings themselves - extremely pretty - they are what I expected. The only thing that disappointed me was the size of the backings...really SMALL and which I had to replace. I'm sure I would lose these earrings if I did not replace them -- they should have come with bigger, tighter backings."
3,"Good Book for Reference, But Not A Sole-Source","I give this book 4 stars as a reference, 2 stars as an ""exam cram"". Took and passed the 70-64 Win95 exam today. I referred to this book alot while studying, but I don't think anyone would pass on this alone. I found only a couple errors. Probably this book was more beneficial for the 70-63 Win95 exam, but don't overlook it if you plan taking the 70-64 exam."
3,Good but out of date,"I ordered this book because it was assigned for my class in learning Spanish. It came right away and then when I brought it to class I found that the edition I was sold is obsolete (Copy right 2000) and the book required is the later version (copyright 2011, 2006) I can't use it to follow the class discussion but it is a useful reference."
4,Very good and educational,This is a very good book. We used it in our large organization during our Spanish classes and the book was well received.
3,Bsg audio,"Super simple, was hoping for more complexity I have not gotten to the later chapters hopefully the types of audio become more open ended in response requirements"
5,Jarvis Spanish Grammer,"The book was paperback, in good condition, and easy to use. It is packed with useful information and proves to be an excellent suppliment to Rosetta Stone for understanding conversational Spanish."
5,Tab Benoit's Whiskey Store,"I normally don't like ""live"" albums, but this is fantastic. I loved my copy so much that I bought this one for a friend."
2,Too Brief,"This book provides an overview of hedge fund structures, strategies, and investing. Though it provides an introduction to hedge fund strategies, its descriptions of these investment techniques are overly simple."
5,UNDERSTAND THE HEDGE FUND STRATEGIES MANAGERS USE,"Nicholas examines all the hedge fund strategies in detail and provides the investor with examples of all the strategies used by managers. Excellent for understanding the mechanics of each strategy. As a doctoral student in business administration doing a thesis on hedge funds, I highly recommend this book for all investors"
1,Not worth the time,"This is one of the drier books on hedge funds (granted, the whole topic is dry, but this particular book is drier than most)."
1,Inaudible -- The Worst Sounding DVD Ever,"This might be a good film. I found it impossible to tell, due to the incredibly bad soundtrack. At first I thought it was something the matter with my sound system, but no, it was the DVD. It sounds as if several layers of cotton and a few sweaters were put around the microphones during the making of the film. There is absolutely no excuse for the DVD being released with a soundtrack as muddy as this one has.Don't buy this DVD."
2,The Sound and the Furious,"I agree with the review on poor sound. It echos and is quite difficult to understand; my students would agree. The viewing experience turned out to be frustrating for them, but at times they were able to establish the events for more popular scenes. Recommended if you desire a visual or are a Chekov purist."
3,somewhat miscast,"If you watch this on Netflix streaming the sound is fine. The problem is that the eldest sister, who was written as 28 is played by an actress well into her fifties, while the middle sister, who should be a young twenty five is played by an actress (the redoubatable Joan Plowright) in her mid thirties. It is very stagy, but this is not always a bad thing, but the camera work is amatuerish at best and the direction haphazard."
2,Rather Wrong,"Pompous Olivier doesn't deliver the minalism. Chekhov and the British are incompatible. If you're looking for some other pithless interpretations with Olivier, check out his lackluster Hamlet."
2,Taylor Caldwell?,One of my favorite authors just broke my heart with this terrible book. I should have read the reviews first but didn't think it was necessary. Horrid! Childishly written!
3,so bad it's good,"Hell-Riders is a modern biker-western movie starring Adam West. I laughed until my stomach started hurting it was so bad. I am still not sure if it was intended to be silly, or surreal, but it builds into a big free for all with West as the Sheriff and these thugs and everyone else in town shooting at each other. Since they have mostly terrible aim and chase each other around a lot, it takes a lot of time to do this, plus the cheap drama scenes. I wouldn't want to pay more than five bucks for it but it is a true gem since it is entertaining to watch in a beer-drinking sort of way."
5,"A great kid's movie, don't let the packaging fool you...","This movie is a hidden treasure. The packaging and the lack of extra content on the DVD make this look like it is going to be another cheap kiddie cartoon with a low budget and no production values.Then you start the movie, and it blows you away! This movie is every bit as good as most of the Disney movies we own, and significantly better than the Disney direct-to-DVD movies. My daughters love it, my youngest sings along to the songs, and it is one of those rare movies that I don't mind sitting down and watching with them.The music is, for the most part, very different than you'll find in most kid-targeted movies, and surprisingly good. The story is fun, the animation top-notch.This is one that my kids have watched over and over again, and I highly recommend it for your video library if you have younger children."
2,Get Paid More and Promoted Faster,"This book was a very disappointing collection of weak common-sense philosophies for getting ahead in your career. Basic lip service that might be somewhat helpful to a twenty year old bagging groceries for a living, but certainly useless for any motivated person who has started their career. Mr. Tracy's ""book"" is more like a pamphlet, in content, and can't hold a candle to strong career enhancement books like The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People or Winning Through Intimidation. I only purchased this book because I read a favorable write up of it on CNN's web site-I guess I will have to take their recommendations with a grain of salt in the future."
4,"it does the job, and well at that","As far as a tea strainer goes, it certainly worksother people have commented that while the sides of this thing are a fine mesh perfect for the role, that the bottom allows the powder to drop through, leaving a sediment at the bottom of your tea. This is correct, and is what makes this product a 4 star product instead of 5.Personally, I have no problems with this, but if you do, search on. Other than that little issue, it has been fantastic.I drink approximately five cups of tea per day"
4,"Good for tea, difficult to hold...","I got this little guy as a small Xmas present, and have been pleased with it. Very useful. I agree with small bits of tea comments above through the holes in the bottom of the infuser, but it's such a small amount that it wouldn't cause anyone trouble. The general ergonics of the design are lacking. It's quite hard to hold by the handle, with no way to leverage the cup vertical (fingers slip down the handle). Only way I can figure out is to hold the cup itself, fingers through the handle but only near the very tip of the rim when hot. Needless to say, I enjoy using it, and the lip does have some significance to it, so it can be held in this manner quite easily.Looking forward to many tea infusions at work now, and moving up to better loose teas in purchases. :)"
4,Neat and tidy tea mug infuser,"I have recently been brewing my own herbal blend infusions, not actually tea, and have found this mug to fit my needs. The mug is simple and streamlined, and very easy to use. I appreciate the mug and infuser design, which is sturdy and clean.I simply boil my water in the glass in the microwave, add my herbal blend to the infuser basket, and dunk the basket into the mug. I let it set for however long I want, then reheat in the glass as appropriate, and enjoy.My only concern is that the infuser would be nice if it had a plunger mechanism. I just press the herbs with a spoon to get the full flavor. Also, the mug does not hold heat, and I usually like my infusion boiling hot!All in all, this is a great product, which I anticipate much use out of."
3,The Biggest Bear,This book was recommended by several people as a wonderful book.However my sensibilities seem to have changed as in 1952 when the book was written bears still went to the zoo or God forbid the circus. I would no longer tolerate this and would not recommend this book to any child.However the book is nicely illustrated in sepia colours.Being a city person I certainly don't approve of children running around with guns.I realize this book needs to be seen related to the time it was written in but I defenitely would not recommend this book.
2,Proceed with caution...,"I purchased this book on the recommendation given by Jim Trelease in ""The Read Aloud Handbook."" This book was given as an example of a book he would read when trying to develop longer attention spans than those required by the average picture book. What Mr. Trelease failed to mention was the disturbing imagery of children carrying guns and dead animals slung over hunters' shoulders. I don't allow my son to have toy guns and I desperately try to filter the steady diet of violence our society thoughtlessly feeds to our children. If I had seen this book before I purchased it, I can assure you, I would not have bought it. I realize this book was created in a world that no longer exists; with the abundance of wonderful children's books available, think twice before exposing your child to this relic."
1,This book is offensive and inappropriate!!!!!!!!,"This book contains disturbing images and illustrations of dead bears slung over hunters' shoulders, little boys toting guns and nightmare inducing violent images. A young boy is supposed to shoot his 'pet bear' however, the book's 'happy ending' instead features the bear captured and living in a tiny cage in a zoo!!! Appalling! How could anyone besides an NRA card carrier and serial killer want to read this to a child?"
2,"Not A Get Rich Quick Pitch, But Outdated","This book presents a lot of very practical information about the basics of formulating a 900 number concept, evaluating the concept, getting started and marketing. Particularly someone with no marketing background could benefit from some of the promotional/advertising tips.However, the book was last updated in--I believe--'96. It basically predates the Internet as we know it. Most of the companies mentioned in this book seem to have gone out of business or have exited the 900 number business.900 ain't what it used to be. This book was written during a different era. I only wish there were an equally sober and well done, but more up to date resource ..."
3,Passable.,"Flew generally does a rather poor job of defending atheism. This statement comes from one who is himself an atheist, or at least an agnostic, depending on your definition of the difference between the two terms and where the line is drawn, and what my mood is on the day you ask. So if **I** don't find him convincing, I doubt that anyone not already inclined to agree with him would. Still, he does a fair job of arguing his points in the chapters in which he dismisses Marxism, defends the right of the individual to choose the time of his/her own death, raises the interesting question of when/if it is appropriate to ""deprogram"" someone who has allegedly been ""brainwashed"" into a religious ""cult"" that is disapproved of, discusses racism, and disputes Skinnerian behavioralism. So on the whole, I'll give him a solid ""C"". Not impressive, but not without merit."
4,Fun and lighthearted,"I really enjoy this series, I also read the Au Pair series, which I liked a little better, but still this is fun and witty. The characters are nice and relatable. I recommend this to anyne looking for an easy and lighthearted read."
5,Amazing,"I took this book for my english book report thinking that it will be quite boring but obce i've started it, i've finished it in 2 hours!! It's the best book i've read these past years. It's easy to understand and has a plot that could happen to anyone"
2,"not so good, no real point","I read this book, thinking that it might be entertaining. But it was SO slow! I felt that it never got to the point. When I finished the book I felt that there had been no real conflict and no real resolution. It had some fun moments, but I felt that the author was hoping to keep it open for a sequel and not enough attention was paid to this book."
2,Nice looking stand. Bad packaging and instructions.,"The stand looks nice when fully assembled though the instructions are terrible as well as the packaging. I had to take it apart a couple of times because of using the wrong bolts.But whatever the main problem I had was the packaging of this item. It is protected by styrofoam and the box was heavy damaging from UPS. When I opened the box to pull the thing out, the styrofoam flew everywhere covering my whole room and broke apart in my hands trying to take out the stand.Then I noticed when assembling the stand, that the bottom 2 shelves had broken off from those circular metal tabs you bolt on from behind. So I had two loose shelves and had to use glue for those metal things to put them back on.Hopefully it holds and won't fall off or move around."
1,lousy customer service,"what a joke! I get an extra small dog collar and I need a large one. I call and can't understand the foreign customer rep, but am told if I don't want to pay return shipping, I can go to a Petco and return it for a store credit. Ha! I ordered it online from here because I didn't want to go to the store in the first place. Won't be getting anything from Petco again!"
4,Living Sufism,If you have read the Carl Ernst books on Sufism you will get a good feel for the academic view. If you read this you will get a good feel for the living tradition of Sufism. This book is great for those who want to go beyond studying Sufism to experiancing Sufism.
3,This is a delightful cd of movie music,This is another cd by Chris that i'm thrilled to add to my colletion.For this project Chris choose to do a movie theme cd. He choose both old and new material.I think Chris did a good job with this venture. He seemed to come up with some wholesome arrangements. His piano never sounded better. This will definately be a cd that will get much playing time on my cd player.Recommendation: I would like to recommend this cd.
5,Film Music Piano Forte-Opus 3,We lost the first CD we had was glad we could buy another. Fast delivery
4,"Well written, insightful and disturbing","A well-written, harrowing account of growing up amid dysfunction, and specifically, of being saved from a total death of the spirit by a rich protective inner life.Parts of this account are indulgent and perhaps even a little precious in its notion of being ""saved"" by words and the imagination, but nevertheless this is an absorbing book as well as a quiet and thoroughgoing indictment of the neglectful abuse that exists in many, many households, and as described here, will strike an emotional chord in many readers, as it did for me."
5,An interesting perspective,"This is a great book! I have visited New York City many times in my life on business and have always loved that famous skyline. Viewing the city from the air gave me a new appreciation for the great beauty of the buildings that make up that skyline, the grand design of Central Park, and the other elements that make New York City ""world class"" in so many ways. I also enjoyed the brief history of New York contained in the introduction and the interesting facts and trivia in the photo captions."
5,"Excellent Hard House! (""UK NRG Hardhouse"")","The CD calls the music UK NRG Hardouse.I call it awesome.I've never owned a hard house (or house) CD before, and as a plus I got it cheaply, but even if I had to pay the normal price, I would.Steve Thomas is an excellent DJ, and I highly recommend this mix to those who enjoy Hard House, because I love trance and happy hardcore (both very different than hard house), and I love this CD.I like all songs on this disc, but specifically ""Pumping it Out"" by DJ Ziad is very fun to listen to. This CD doesn't disappoint."
4,BUY THIS CD!,"This CD is one continuous mix of one Tripoli hard house anthem after another. Wonderful mixing all the way through. Near the end of the CD Steve Thomas throws in two of his own songs to spice it up a bit (personally I believe that Steve Thomas climaxed the mix with his own songs on purpose). Steve also tries to trick the listener with a mix from some hard driving NU NRG to a section of a vocal, happy, clubby house song, but he throws it back into NU NRG flawlessly. A beautiful mix, what else can I say. Also, check out The NRG Files (another CD w/ the Tripoli flavor)."
4,absolutely cool stuff,"This is my first experience with Ozrics' live recordings. I like it very much. Especially Pixel Dream is cool. It has a nice flow to it and the break is very energetic. The (studio recorded) title track is absolutely smoking! This is one of the missing links between (progressive) rock and techno-trance. It has sheer energy from start to end; kicks off like some techno tune 'til the guitars kick in, then it really grabs you. Check it out."
3,review #1,This was actually an excellent book. However the particular one that I receieved was missing 20 pages that had been cut out. The distriubutor refunded my money promply so I cant really complain to much.
4,Spin The table,"The Gottlieb Collection presents a healthy variety of pinball machines from various decades. The machines are very fun to play and a very good adaptation to the electronic platform. The gameplay feels true to real pinball action. The player is given 4 free machines to earn credits to play the other ""locked"" games, by achieving goals on the various machine you can unlock games. Each machine has it's own goal and hitting these goals motivates the player to play better. The only critism I have for this game is that it is very hard to achieve the goals. I give it a 4/5 rating due to the high level of difficulty, I find it to be one of the harder games for the PSP. Pinball fans should be very happy with this release."
3,Pungent but works,"When we got a new flat screen tv we had to prevent our cord loving cats from chewing all those cables and cords. We bought a few packets of CritterCord and covered all exposed cords. It certainly kept both our cats away, who after a few sniffs did not venture near this area again. However, the pungent smell of CritterCord is strong although fading somewhat after the first month. Hopefully the smell will continue to fade more while the thick transparent plastic will continue to prevent our cats chewing these cables and cords. If it wasn't for this smell I would have have given this a 5 star review as it definitely keeps our cats away!"
1,Our cat loves it!,"I installed some Crittercord on a USB printer cable in my wife's office and thought everything would be fine. I was so confident the product would work that I ordered a bunch more. Several weeks later I was in my wife's office and she happened to mention that her printer wasn't working. It turns out the cat loves to chew on Crittercord as much as he loves to chew on the cords themselves! It was hard to believe because the stuff smells so bad, but the covered cable was just destroyed by the cat. Unfortunately, I was unable to return the four spools of unused product I had ordered because it was beyond the company's 30-day return policy.I hope it works for your cat, but it didn't for mine."
3,Works as advertised but a bit pricey.,The product works as advertised but wire loom does just as well at a fraction of the cost. The only advantage to CritterCord is that it is clear so it works better for areas where the cord will be visible.
1,Who could stand the smell?,This product is an example of a good idea gone bad. I cannot emphasize enough that this smells so bad you can't use it. It made my entire house smell. In the end I had to bag it up and throw it away.
4,P-U,"Very good for covering the large power wires my ""wireless"" speakers have so the cat doesn't ruin them like the last pair, but stank to the high heavens for the first week. Can't even smell them now but the cat hasn't chewed them and she chews anything that isn't covered."
1,major fail,the first time i ordered this it never came. cat then chewed through a second very expensive power cord while waiting for a replacement to arrive. cat just chewed through the third replacement while the cord was IN the protector. not worth it.
2,smells bad,"The cord cover helped protect my cord, since my puppy pulled it off so that he could chew it. The taste didn't phase him at all (he's also indifferent to bitter apple spray). I suppose if he had left it on the cord, it would have provided some measure of protection. I, however, found the smell of the cord protector so overpowering and awful that I couldn't bear to have the thing in my house and ended up throwing it away about 2 days after I bought it."
1,the smell drove us out of the house,"unfortunately from the moment we took it out of the box the smell made us nauseous. ""citrus scent"" indeed - it smells like insecticide. And it permeated the house during the day especially when it was warm. Hoped it would fade after a while but no.the cord protector looked to be of good quality and the reviews were great, so we may just be oversensitive; if you are sensitive to smells be forewarned."
1,Critter cords,"They don't work for my rabbit. He licks them to death, he has chewed, and digested the plastic right through to the cord they are supposed to protect, he seems attracted to them even, and won't leave them alone!!!"
1,Chewed cords or Stink? Not sure which is worse,This stuff smells so bad i dont know if it is worse to let him chew the cords! 6 months later my house still reeks frm othe few cords we decided to cover- it is NOT worth it! No way is this citrus! It is a nauseating chemical smell.
2,Reeks!,"I wish I had read the reviews of this before I bought it. Our rabbits systematically destroyed many electrical chords as I raced to find the best bunny-proofing material available. I saw this product and immediately ordered it, not really noticing the ""citrus"" fragrance.As soon as I opened the box I was overwhelmed with a not-unpleasant detergent smell that then turned into a horrible bug spray/perm solution funk that gave me a headache. I figured it would fade and used it to cover a laptop chord. It seems to work fine ( although one bunny sniffed it for a long time in great interest; she may be eating it soon) but the whole apartment reeks now.I've been out in the fresh air for an hour and I still can't get the scent out of my nose.I'm very disappointed.Yes, it does the job but so would unscented pvc tubing, without the olfactory torture."
2,Smells REAL BAD -- for a LONG TIME,"It was not worth stinking up the entire house to keep the cat from biting the wires. I think just the plastic sheath without the strong smell would have worked just as well. I placed the cords on two lamps in the bed room over a week ago, and the room still has the bad odor from the ""citrus"" smell, smells more like cat vomit to me."
2,"Deters humans, too","I put one of these on my new laptop cord after my cat chewed through the first one. Rest assured, the cat will not chew this one, or even go near it. That's because it smells like a combination of household cleaners and skunk. I don't know if we're going to be able to keep the thing. It's stinking up the whole house.As a side note, my husband decided to taste it, and it is indeed bitter. I suppose it tastes like Lysol and skunk."
2,Smelly,"This cord cover works, but it smells terrible! It stunk up my apartment for two weeks. I would not purchase this again."
2,Dogs loved to chew it!,"I foster homeless dogs, so I always have a wide variety of dogs in the house who love to chew. Keeping my computer cord safe is always a challenge, but I had high hopes when I purchased this product. Unfortunately it didn't work for me. One of my foster dogs seemed to enjoy chewing it more than the regular cord with no protection."
1,He liked it - He hated it,The odor made my husband very ill.The taste made my bunny very happy.We rate it 'half a star' - shouldn't the company get credit for trying? Maybe not.
2,Bodily Functions = Brilliant - AroundTheHouse = Not So Much,"I first bought Herbert's Bodily Functions CD. If you like ambient or downtempo music and you like jazz (i.e. Coltrane, not Kenny G)then run out and buy Bodily Functions immediately. It is really a great CD. It is intelligent and sometimes transporting music made with sequencers(and rounded out with more traditional instruments). Often a song will start with a simple electronic beat, but as it progresses it is layered with vocals and jazz chords, until it has acheived a real musicality often not present in electronic music.So I was excited to hear AroundTheHouse, but wound up being disappointed. It has none of the beautiful jazz improv present in Bodily Functions, and the sequencing just doesn't reach the same heights. I suggest avoiding this earlier effort. Also check out Herbert's Secondhand Sounds- it has great Herbert remixes of other artist's songs. It is also highly recomended."
5,A complete cohesive view of b-to-b marketing management,"Business marketing is not my strong suit, but this book really brought some things together for me. It's readable, focused, and definitely gives you a hook to hang things on--one way to view the world of busines-to-business marketing that makes sense. I teach electronic marketing, and have more familiarity with the consumer side. After reading this book, I felt a much better grounding of essential b-to-b concepts like the value chain. I strongly recommend this book."
1,Too much Poetry,It is amazing how the authors can write so many paragraphs which mean so little. This book could have half of the pages it contains. Not worth the price.
4,A Quick Iraq Sampler Overview,"Short articles by various authors with varying opinions is the strength of this collection. .....BR>I found it to be a fine introduction to the topic and it prompted me to read more. Paul Williams Roberts piece had me in stitches. Considering the serious nature and how upsetting the reality of life in Iraq can be, this was no small feat.I learned a tremendous amount for a small bit of reading. The articles can be redundant and certainly overlapped topics. I actually found this helpful from a credibility and retention standpoint.If you can get a copy on loan or at a discount price, I highly recommend it. ....."
4,Easier to pinpoint item with smaller coil.,"I have a Discovery 3300, definitely not top of the line, but was on clearance from Radio Shack a couple of years back. The larger coil that came with the unit works fine, but without a pin-pointer requires a bit of time to find the item within the tone area. Cannot speak as to whether or not this coil can distinguish metal types any better than the default coil, as I haven't worked with it for very long, also I'm still a novice when it comes to metal detectors, but one thing I noticed right away, the 4 inch coil is definitely better at pinpointing more precisely where objects are located...that of course saves time, which is an obvious benefit while treasure hunting."
2,Don't buy,I bought this for my grand kids what a waste of money this was a replacement head for the one that comes with the machine it worked just as bad. Don't waste your money
3,Ask if you really need to buy this coil,"I have seen reviews about pinpointing with this, but I believe that is more due to the deficiency of the detector rather than anything inherently superior in in using a smaller coil. The smaller coil tends to slow you down. I suspect that is what has led to many of the raving happy reviews about how well this coil works rather than anything inherently better about the designIts a small coil and I bought it based on other reviews. I rarely use it, I find the coil that 8"" coil that comes standard is just fine.Save your money and use it to get some decent headphones."
1,Does not pick up gold nuggets false advertisement. I tested it with a gram of gold and nothing,If you are looking to find gold nuggets this is not the answer. This is no different then the one already on your detector. I tested it and it worked no differently then the one that came on your metal detector. If you need it to get into smaller spaces then it will work for that purpose but it will not pick up gold nuggets unless they are whoppers like 5 grams + and that is rarely found. Even then your other coil that comes with your bounty hunter would work the same as this little one. I would not invest money in this unless you need it for small spaces. This will not pick up small nuggets. I am a avid miner and have tested it on gold. save yourself the $40 and save up for a tesoro compadre which will pick up small nuggets and it is only $160 free shipping on amazon and ebay. This also does not have the bounty hunter sticker on it so it is a knock off and false advertised in my opinion.
3,confused a little,i thought the packaging was cheap..just a clear plastic bag. no paperwork included. i was disappointed there was no instructions. no information on the coil.
3,plug in,I wish I had known this had a female end. Now I have to find a double male end. but otherwise I received it in good time.
5,A Good Product,"I purchased this product about six months ago and have been perpetually using it since then! Even though my Bounty Hunter 4 detector came with a different search coil, I have been using this one instead. It really helps one to quickly narrow down (pinpoint) where the metal item is in the ground. With this coil, I have found items as far down as eight inches in the ground. Technically, it isn't supposed to be able to detect this far, but it does!Simply stated, it's a good product! If you can, get it."
5,"Bounty Hunter 4"" search coil","I recieved my 4"" coil it plug in to my metal detector no problem. It operates just as describe .I have a Bounty Hunter metal detector, Decovery 1100 . very happy with it . shipment was quick, would recommend this product. thanks good job."
5,Must-have MD accesory,This is predictably well made and works as advertised. Goes on easily and does perform well. It is a good value too. You may find gold with this coil!
4,Product works great.,"Happy with the product, works great and started finding items right away. What kept me from giving a 5 star was the fact that the coil is not whats in the picture, it does not say bounty hunter on it, it just plain black. Other than that the product works fine for me."
1,Bounty Hunter Gold Nugget Search Coil,Purchased product for my husband. We tested the Gold Nugget Search Coil to find my gold wedding ring that we put on the floor. No signal was picked up til we were 2 inches away from it. Would not recommend this product as it does not work.
2,"WE LOVE YOU, MICHAEL...BUT NOT THIS BOOK","We are of dissenting opinion here. True, the book is loaded with facts that we didn't know before,...but being absolute DIEHARD fans of Sir Bolton outside of listing albums and songs, correct syntax, every plug for Joyce's fan club,...and the attitude in general that all Michael Bolton is...is BEEFCAKE! Our preference for a book about Michael Bolton is MICHAEL BOLTON by Lee Randall, which delves more into his career and early hardships,...and whose binding holds up more than 2 days. Michael is a reputed perfectionist-but this book is far from perfect. By all means, PLEASE, get Secret Of The Lost Kingdom and his albums (including LOVE SHOULDN'T HURT)-they're woth every cent. This one...we're not so sure"
2,Not so fast--beautiful but flawed,"Yes, this cookbook is beautiful and a welcome addition to growing library of books associated with the Church's liturgical year. BUT the recipes are deeply flawed. It's obvious that the author did not really test the recipes--for example, the sesame/anise bread for St. Joseph's Day calls for 4 cups flour, 6 eggs, 2 cups water, and 1/2 cup of melted shortening. Anyone who knows how to cook would know instantly that you will not end up with a kneadable dough with those quantities but rather a form of library paste. So beware if you try to cook from this book."
5,A Treasure,"Amazon.com, you are the greatest. This was given to a friend as a gift. They raved about it. This is truly a""Heavenly Book"". Thank you once again for your promptness."
1,cooking with the Saints,"I am a Catholic and a good cook. I would not buy this book because of the review! I do not like Martha Sterart way before she got caught for insider trading.I imagine I am not the only person who feels this way!Thanks,NS"
1,Not for all Vampire Romance Lovers,"Just couldn't get into this book. . .I am a voracious romance reader (& I've been enjoying vampire novels since the late 80's) but I did not enjoy this book at all. The plot was fine, but I've never liked this particular author's writing style~I don't know if it's her word choice or grammar or what, but the books of hers I've attempted reading (including several under her pen name, DANA RANSOM) have required an effort to get through. If you're a fan of this author, then great, I'm sure you'll enjoy this one, too. If not, I'd highly recommend (in the vampire genre) these books: PRINCE OF THE NIGHT by JASMINE CRESSWELL and THE VAMPIRE VISCOUNT by KAREN HARBAUGH."
1,Incomplete Book: no Appendix C,"I'm highly dissappointed about this book. It makes good reference to all leadership issues and is of course a good recopilation of theories and practical recommendations about leader's behavior and the expectations he must fulfill, but sends the reader with high frequency to ""Appendix C"", which is not included in the book.I feel like I got a fragment of the publication at the complete price.The worst of my purchases."
3,It isn't so bad,"If you like the song called ""JOY"" performed by blackstreet, this CD will be your favorite one."
5,"Raves for ""Always Another Horizon""","One of the best first-person travel accounts we have ever read. The book chronicles an 8 year-long circumnavigation on a 40 foot sailboat, giving intimate, inspiring and exciting details of countries and cultures that you won't find in most travel books. Highly recommended."
3,Grab-n-go,"Interesting, there is no question, but is more a ship's log than what you can imagine thinking about a ""travel"".Grab-n-go images of (our) unrealized dreams!"
4,Diffent and untold,"Gives information about one of the areas of the Napoleonic Wars that is not well documented,but still misses some units like the Poles in Santo Domingo. Goo intro into this era of history."
2,oops!,"Dark Funeral seems to be digging its heels in with this release. It is a near carbon-copy of the band's prior effort, Secrets Of The Black Arts. The only redeeming quality to this album is that the disc which it strives so hard to mimic was actually pretty good-- so good that I didn't mind hearing it a second time. But only a second time-- three is too many. Here's hoping DF progress before their next release."
4,THE BEST DARK FUNERAL ALBUM EVER,YOU WILL TRULY ENJOY THIS ALBUM BECAUSE ITS 100 PERCENT EVIL THE LYRICS ARE VERY SINISTER AND THE MUSIC IS MAJESTIC. I CALL THIS ONE OF THE BEST BLACK METAL ALBUMS EVER. THE BAND MEMBERS ARE TRULY THE SONS OF SATAN
2,Tim Lahaye's Left Behind Prophecy,"I like the Left Behind Series in both books and movies. This is a documentary, so read closely before purchasing. All talk no action. This is probably not what you are expecting. It sure wasn't what I expected."
1,Tim LaHaye's Left Behind the Prophecy,"Well having seen the other Left Behind movies I thought this one was basically the same format. Well is isn't! It is a documentary, I guess I should have read closer. This was not at all entertaining."
2,Returned,"Not great. Returned these because they were an odd color and very tiny. Have been very happy with other earring purchases from amazon so tried these, but definitely not worth the price. (really don't look like emeralds!)"
3,KATELAND,"THIS MOVIE IS NOT MEANT TO BE ENJOYED. IT HAS GONE WAY PAST ALL THAT. UNSPEAKABLE ACTS OF VIOLENCE DONE TO ANOTHER HUMAN BEING, [HIS WIFE] SOME OF THESE SCENES MAY BE UPSETING FOR SOME. BUT THE STORY IS TRUE TO LIFE. GOOD ACTING, WITH LOVELY DONNA MILLS PLAYING THE LONG SUFFERING WIFE."
3,Just a Question,"This is no review but people said that the TV wonder pro shouldn't be used for xbox, what about a ps1? Does anyone know if it will sorta work well fora a ps1. I don't have any intentions to hook up a xbox but i wanted to try and get a ps1 hooked up to it. I was just wondering if it is a bad idea or if it will be as bad as people say it will be. (I just put a rating because it forced me to if i wanted to submit this)"
2,not very good,"I bought this becuase I thought that ATI made good products.I havnt had too much problems with this card, except that the sound is awful. It makes strange clicks when I change the channel. I have to turn down the volume as low as possible and still hear, because if I turn it up any louder, there would be too much distortion. It's very annoying."
2,Do Not Buy,"Its box clearly says, compatible with windows-XP, but it freezes my win-XP computer whenever I try to turn off the TV. (I am running it with INTEL 865PERL motherboard, 768MB RAM & P4 2.4Ghz-800Mhz MB, and windows XP prof version with SP1)Do not buy this card.The CD installs many unwanted taskbars by default too."
3,"Good hardware, bad software and support","ATI makes excellent hardware. That is what they do. They are not software designers. I have been having problems with their software ever since I bought the card. The newest version of their multimedia center (currently 9.13) is very buggy, and does not integrate with their online TV guide program; the best current version of their software is 9.06.1, available on their support webpage, but even this version has some problems.I decided to find a software manufacturer that makes software for TV cards, and decided on SnapStream's Beyond TV."
3,Bad Software Support - But hardware is not bad,"I have had this card for a few months and I think what everyone knows is that ATI MMC software sucks! It works OK to watch tv on the computer but as far as playing consoles like Xbox it's delay video makes it hard to play. There is a way around this though. Use a different TV player software. There is one in particular that worked nicely but was hard to setup and that was ""Chris TV"" It's a TV program like ATI's MMC. You can get close video quality to match the ATI's MMC video soap look and your games are very responsive. I will look for better alternatives but the problem is not the card it's the software. And the person who is getting the clicking sound while changing channels. Try updating your motherboard chipset drivers. I found that helped 100% with soundblaster/sb audigy cards. No more clicking. Anyway hope that helps and maybe some one out there will write a better TV viewer program."
2,NOT THEIR BEST INDEED. NOT FOR BEGINNERS,"I AM A VERY, VERY HUGE FAN OF VDGG, BUT I ADMIT THIS CD IS JUST FOR ULTRA HARD CORE FANS. IT INDEED HAS A COUPLE OF JEWELS, BUT THE SOUND IS TERRIBLE ON SOME TRACKS, LIKE BAD DEMOS. THE SOUND QUALITY AND MUSIC FROM THE STUDIO ALBUMS BLOWS THIS ONE AWAY."
4,Great!!! *IF* you are a die hard VDGG fan!,"TIME VAULTS actually came out around 1985-86 on LP VINYL, when I purchased it. Being almost;,insane at the time, CRAVING ANY NEW/{unheard of Van der Graff}, this WAS the perfect medicine!. The 'Liquidator' is a beautiful 'pre-composition' of almost a full song, and STILL my favorite ;{ Keep in mind these are tapes from the PRE-CD Era!},so fidelity is NOT the reason for purchase!!!, but *TRUE*! VDGG *Outakes from studio sessions I still love and cherish!SUMMARY!; If you are a""DIE HARD VAN FAN"" as I AM, You MUST! purchase this for historic sake.. IF, you are a listener/CRITIC that love's to pick it apart *things* because you have no REAL life,DON'T!, WASTE OUR BELOVED, LOYAL!!!, Van Der Graff's community's time!Merry Christmas to ALL!"
1,Horrible Sound Quality,"This album sounds like it was recorded under the worst possible conditions. From what I can hear of the music, I imagine this would have been awesome if it was listenable. It isn't. It sounds as if it was recorded over a telephone wire. Awful awful, awful. ONLY get this after you get all the other VdGG albums. And maybe not even then. I no longer have this one, and I don't plan on re-purchasing this headache. And that's coming from a seasoned VdGG fanatic."
3,Still waiting,"I bought this for the peace of mind, charged it over night, somehow the last time I used it and it didn't work.At the time I was changing the distributor, and I wasn't sure what went wrong.I left it in the car for a period of about 3 months, and it went dead.I took it apart, recharged the battery. It seems fine, since then I recharge it every two months now.The bad part about the re-charger is that it didn't tell you if the battery is full or not.The light is always orange color. I tested it with a meter and it read 12W.Still waiting for the moment. Hope it will work."
1,[imitation] [stuff],VERY [imitation] sounds like a bunch of [[people] pretended to be singers. good lord this is terrible. i would rate it one star if i could
4,I loved Vellie!,This book was a great read! It has interesting twists I didn't expect. Vellie has a secret he is loath to share and then he falls in love--how much better can it get?
3,great book - terrible voice,"I am new to books on tape and I really have been enjoying all of the Deveraux novels....the ""Duchess"" was delightful and I really enjoyed the plot....my great disappointment with the product(tape)was the narration....the actor reading the story- I am sure is a fine stage actor....but his voice did not belong to the female characters - just when the plot got interesting I found myself laughing and distracted at the horrible voices he used for this strong willed educated ""Duchess""-to be. This is one case when a stong male voice really added to the story but lessen the role of Claire..really great story Ms Deveraux...but screen the voices better...."
2,I have read better,I have read quite a few deveraux books and I was disappointed by this one. She has the potential to do much better
3,Horrible ending,"This was a great book but when I read the ending I was so mad!!! What a horrible way to end a book, nothing was resolved, no revenge on the mother,no wedding, no babies. The ending just said they got married, the older brother did'nt want to be the Duke.The ending should have put the mother in her place, a pregnancy out of wedlock would have been excellent and a least a huge wedding with Villie claiming his rightful place, the ending left you wanting so much more, UGH!!!!!! I read all that time for nothing."
5,Duchess,"This book is classic Jude Deveraux showing her strong female counterparts to their rich, established leading male character."
4,Everyone Loves a Rogue,"Trevelyan steals the heart of Harry Montgomery's bride-to-be. Arranged marriages are never what they seem and Claire Willoughby must find her own way in a Scottish castle that is desperately in need of money, her money!THE DUCHESS is one of Jude Deveraux's all time favorite romances, which has stood the test of time. An excellent summer read.Nash Black, author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
4,"Trevelyan...Oh so hot ,yet annoying","Its been a while(over a couple of months)since I've read this book,but it is still one of my all time favourite romances.Claire thinks she is in love with Harry the titled yet pennilessduke.She does not realise her true feelings until she meetsTrevelan,whom she assumes to be an old man at first sight.Which was so funny.(she calls him a horrid old man)In harry's company Claire is bored to death as they have nothing in common,but in Trevelyan's company she could really be herself.Hmmm...who would you choose?Overall a highly entertaining novel,recomended for all Jude Deveraux fans"
5,HELP ANYONE,"I have not yet read this book for I am trying to find out in which order does this book come in the Montgomery series order. I can't seem to find an e-mail for Jude Deveraux to ask her so I'm asking anyone if they can help. I have acouple books from her and I have found that they all are part of a series. The book that I have are. (BLACK LYON, HIGH TIDE, THE TEMPTRESS, AND THE VELVET PROMISE.) I don't know about any of you all but I hate reading a book and finding out that it was part of a series."
1,THIS BOOK S**** SO BAD~!!,"oh my gosh~!! this is one of the worst books i've ever read~!!i'd rather eat dirt for dinner for the rest of my life than read thisbook again... itz so bad~!! *choke* *puke* argh... i was so frustrated with that horrible girl.. she cheated on her husband... and then she fallz in luv wit a weirdo old ugilee guy... sowie... i usually luv jude deveraux... in fact, this is the only book of herz i've read that i dislike/hate... itz horrible.. but i recommend jude deveraux's series of velvet angel, velvet song, highland velvet, and uh... the last one.. i can't remember.. those are the best books i've read~!! i've read each one over 10 times~!! itz incredible.. great job jude~!! keep it up~!!"
2,Not one of the best,"I have read several of Jude Deveraux's books, and I was very disappointed with this one. The ""hero"" was hardly my idea of a hero. I really did not like the man at all. He bragged about his sexual exploits and was egotistical, as well. A disappointment."
5,Beautiful tale of love and family,"This is among my favorites by Jude Deveraux.Claire is marrying someone from a long prestigious line of history, and she is well read and know a lot about the family. Harry could care less about the history of his family. Harry didn't care about much of anything but hunting. Claire sets out to make things better, and in the process, meets Trevelyan. This opens her eyes to a whole array of new thoughts and love. I love hearing more about The Brat (Claire's little sis), Trevelyan's sister, and the exotic Nyssa. Such a great story.If you like any of the other historicals by Jude Deveraux, add this to your wishlist."
1,Worst book ever!!,"I have read many JD books I have loved most of them and felt let down by a few. The Duchess made me angry at both the Heroine and the hero. I could never connect with Claire, JD failed to show any bond between the Brat and Claire, at the end when Claire had to decide who to marry, it was all about her little sister and if she was left penniless. The relationship between Vellie and Claire was disturbing all the time and when he tells her he might not be able to be monogamous, she didn't have a problem with it. Even though she was extremely jealous when another woman entered the story. Nothing about this book made sense. I am sorry I wasted my time reading it!"
3,"Different, but romantic","For some reason I enjoyed this book - although I can come up with many reasons why it would be disinteresting. Trevelyan was intriguing in the sense that I knew that he was both intelligent and handsome, although disturbingly Claire believed him to be an old man. I suppose it is due to the many eccentric or different characters that made this book good. Claire and Trevelyan are not your typical hero or heroine - but they are both interesting. Although, their are some parts in thie novel that are dull, their is not much adventure in this book. However, perhaps this adds to the story since it focuses mostly on the character development instead of the action."
1,I Had To Force Myself To Finish,"Normally, Deveraux's novels are so interesting and captivating that I read two a day. It took me almost a MONTH to sludge through this one, and I almost threw the book away in disgust. It begins interestingly enough, then moves on to idle chit-chat about Trevalyn's travels. When they finally do hit the sheets, it's as unromantic as Jude Deveraux's scenes get. If anything, their encounters were mechanical. The epilogue also left the reader hanging, if they bothered to read to the end."
3,So-So Deveraux,"Jude Deveraux is a really good writer, but this is NOT her best work. The heroine, Claire, was fairly likable because she was such an educated woman. (I enjoyed the fact that she loved to read, read, read.) The hero, Trevelyn, was a disappoinment. I like a strong Scot, and he fell short. (He was plagued by malaria.) Deveraux did not spend as much time on detailing the characters as she usually does. Harry, Trevelyn's brother and Claire's fiance, is a total bore. There is also one scene with Harry's and Trevelyn's mother and Claire. You would think that if there is supposedly so much hate and anger in this woman that there would have been more than one scene with her. She just fades away later in the story. It's almost like Deveraux was told that she had to turn in her finished book right away, so she had to wrap up the ending right then and there. It's a shame. Don't waste your time on this book. Instead, read Knight in Shining Armor by this author. Now, THAT'S a keeper!"
5,Amazingly erotic coming of age story,"Coming of age story of 18 year old Italian boy. His girlfriend keeps complaining thathe isn't affectionate enough. She keeps dropping hints, but he doesn't know what to do. It's a long story, but his piano teacher (Carol Baker) shows him how to do it and the next day he and his girl do it. Amazingly erotic even though the sex scenes don't show all that much. Carol Baker is American, but she speaks Italian. Dubbing into English is good. Sound is curiously muted but audible. The Italian track sounds the same."
5,Good information,I've been a Notes Administrator for about 4 years. This is a great book for all admins to have. There are some great Q&A's in here.
3,BARNEY GOOGLE!!!!!,"One of the Monogram Barney Google-Snuffy Smith films. The Alpha print is acceptable with the usual splices, etc."
2,Taylor Mason vidwo,Not all that funny. Parts were funny but and other banabas video were good but this one wasn't for me that's not to say someone else wouldn't like it. It was a little junior highish for me. Long on silly not so much on funny.
3,Fight for it,"Like a grittier ""Beautiful Thing"", this gay love story is compelling, poignant, and sexy. One guy is a street fighter who's searching for his own life, and the other is a music and club promoter working for a bitchy older gay man. It's definitely one of the better gay films of the past years. None of the characters is entirely likeable, and that's what makes this film so worth watching."
1,"Like it is remains as it is, lame.","Its a movie about finding love, sex , quarrel , get back together , quarrel ..... You get what I mean?Unless you simply buy this movie just to see the two lead actors butt pressing upon each other, its not worth seeing.Acting wasn't genuine like as though they are being themselves which shouldn't be the case. In other words they can't act except for the bitchy boss. If you must, simply rent to see the short sex scenes or else pass this movie. Not worth it."
3,It's alright,It's a good idea for a story but all of the characters are just unappealing. You end up hating every person in this movie at one point of another.
3,It's like ... british movie,"The story about guy who finds his own identity. This is a touching movie and well acted. The GREAT disappointed from the dvd is this movie has no caption close at all. Jezz...for anyone has a trouble with british accent, there will be a ... trouble."
2,"Well-meaning, but cliche-ridden","Other than two cute boys making out, there's really not much to recommend in this film. The plotting is cliched and the characterizations are one-dimensional. Roger Daltry's mugging is embarrassing to watch. Rent it if you must, but don't buy."
2,It just never gathers steam.,"Sure, it's steamy, and the leads are sexy, but we never really get a chance to know or care about them, so their bad choices and struggle to get together just never seems to matter.In fact it was a little boring. Plus, what language are these folks speaking? I know it's English, but it might as well be French.The supporting cast is universally nasty, selfish, uninteresting, and unlovable.Not much to like here. Avoid this unless you have a thing for bloody fights, of which there are a couple."
4,Hot guys!,"This was a fabulous movie about young gay men in London. The lead actors are hot, and the story is pretty good too. Too bad this movie costs so much, or I'd think about buying it. At any rate, it's a must rent for anyone who enjoys gay cinema."
4,It were right good.......,"Its not pretty, not brilliantly acted, small budget and the storylines a bit trashy - I really enjoyed it though not really sure why. I think I just got it. I wasn't expecting a brilliant film and had no pre-conceptions about how it would be. This helped a lot. I've recommended it to many people and opinions are divided. I found it to be enjoyable and fun though, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. A very different film."
3,"It's good, but not great.","This is a good film, I enjoyed it. But to be honest, I felt nothing afterwards. It did nothing to me. *Beautiful thing* is much better. It's still my favourite."
2,OEM not O.E.M.,"OEM is the brand name, not original equipment. Very misleading! It fit well, and so for is working well. ok"
5,Brilliant,"Anyone who wants the good-old goth stuff will be slightly disappointed, but anyone who appreciated good music will enjoy it. It is a new direction in music combining good lyrics, techno, electronica, ambient, gothic, (insert cool word here). In an age when everything is starting to sound the same this album breathes life back into multiple genres."
5,Wow!,"Keely Wilson discovers that life can change in the blink of an eye, but she'd determined to fight her way past a potentially career-ending injury and get her life back. But she needs help. She goes to her old coach, Mac McCandless, for help, and finds a man who's had to deal with his own life changing injury. Rather than fighting against, Mac has accepted his limitations and built a new life. Together Mac and Keely learn that there are things you can't control...sometimes it's physical limitations, and sometimes it's a love that won't be denied, whatever the obstacles.Fay Robinson story of Mac and Keely is a warm, touching story that's guaranteed to touch the readers heart."
3,"wow, surprised by all these rave reviews","This is certainly an enjoyable read and a different take on the standard love story. I especially liked the relationship development between Keely and her mother, which for me was the best part of the book. But two things that showed lack of attention to detail or lack of research ruined this book for me. First, if Keely can run 19 miles in four hours, even at a very slow shuffle walk, it would not take her another four hours to finish the last seven. And second, and more disturbing, a two and a half hour marathon finishing time in the wheelchair division wouldn't even qualify someone for the Olympics, let alone put them in the running for a medal. Typical finishing time for men's wheelchair division is just over an hour and a half. The author should have done more research."
1,Very disgusted!,"This camera was a gift for my son. The display is too dark to see the person/item you are trying to photograph. The pics come out totally dark. We have tried every setting possible to add more light, and no luck! I have a fugi with the same amount of megapixels and it takes perfect pics! I tried to contact vivitar to ask for help, and received no response. My son is so upset!"
4,great for what they are.,"These straps are about what you'd expect for a sleeping bag strap, I bought one pair for my sleeping bag and another pair to put through strap loops on my rucksack. I don't know the weight capacity of these but I would guess that anything that would be too much for the strap to handle wouldn't be something you'd be using a simple strap like this for. Another reviewer said that they aren't ""quick release tabs"" but that is, in fact exactly what they are. He shouldn't give low marks because he doesn't understand the language. Overall I like these straps a heck of a lot more than the more expensive Durarest straps."
3,a little short,"the ones I got work just fine, but mine measured in at 43"". 5"" shorter than the 48"" advertized. Other than that they are good, well made, 1/2"" wide straps with a quick release strap. I bought them to strap bags to my motorbike, and I'll have to order another set because they are too short. 60-72 inch straps would better serve that purpose."
3,straps,came in handy for my outdoors pack. definitely some good extra straps to have in the back woods. I recommend.
2,"Not ""Quick Release""","Package says ""Quick tab release"" but it's just a simple fold over friction buckle. If that's quick release what's slow release? I assumed it was the kind you could pinch and it would open and then you could put it back together at the same length. No such luck. It'll hold you sleeping bag but there is nothing quick about it."
5,"thank you, thank you, thank you...","I have been looking for this film for a long time and now I have it. Delivery was fast, item was as described and in very good condition.Thank you.:)"
2,SO BAD I HAD TO FINISH IT,"If somebody gave me a small budget to make a movie and I gathered all my friends to act in it and help me write it, I think this is the movie that we would have made. There is some of the worst acting I've seen in my life in this, but at the same time it was so bad it was rather entertaining, overacting equals humur, at least here it does. Special effects were pretty cheesy and didn't really add anything much. Overall advoid this film unless you have a soft spot for poo."
5,Vintage Horror,"I love this movie! A true vintage, gothic horror movie! A highschool girl battles the forces of darkness under the tutorage of the archangel Gabriel. A cult classic!"
2,Say Cheese!,"This is pure 80's cheese. I love 80's movies but I can't recommend this one. It's about a kid in highschool who is the anti-Christ and the arc-angels who try to stop him from coming to power. The acting is good and bad with some good special effects for its time. It takes almost 75 minutes to get to the payoff which is too long for a horror film. The dead rising from the graves was cool but not enough to save this film. If you enjoyed movies like Prince of Darkness, The Prophecy, The Omen and Exorcist then you may be disappointed with this one. Rent before you buy."
5,VERY SCARY!,This movie will give you nightmares! It is awesome! Usually I would say watch it alone in the dark BUT DO NOT WATCH IT ALONE! This movie is pretty hard to find these days too and sort of pricey. It needs to be re-released on DVD.
3,"Synthersizer, straight hair, and evil mirror","Sigmund Freud could have written the script, had not the religious people in this film been described as pretty normal. Or at least, their religion is not their problem. But still, killing your mother's lover and then trying to live on sounds like something that would have come straight out of Freud's own dark subconscious.Synthersizer music, women with straight long hair and the colours (among other things) give an early eighties feeling, which of course always is a good thing. The story is not very original, but not uncreative either. A broken mirror and a man who has been dead for 20 years make people bleed, scared or dead. If Michael Myers wears a Halloween mask, Jason a hockey mask, this guy wears a stocking over his head. That's original, but not independent.The film is never scary, but neither uninteresting; actually it's rather fascinating and entertaining."
1,This movie is the worst one I've ever seen!!!,"Do not buy this movie ever. It is a waste of time and money. Watch something, anything, else."
3,definitely a mixture of Halloween and The Amityville Horror,"...this is a downright creepy and scary film, up until the rotten ending...its a chilling and effective thriller which does borrow heavily from Halloween, but it is guaranteed to send shivers down your spine...however a rotten ending ruins it...this film could have been a great cult classic, but with an ending like that, its just cheesy..."
4,"""Beware the Boogeyman! ""","A pretty good horror that is mainly a mix of AMITYVILLE HORROR and HALLOWEEN. This is regarded as a cult classic and once banned in Britain, so when it was re-issued I was more than happy to add it to my ever growing horror collection. Classic."
4,grandma,"I purchased this for a gift and did not watch it myself, I was told that it was well liked by the recipient!"
4,cute,"I saw this video while I was staying at the home of some Christian friends. Like all veggie tales stories they give a Christian message to children in a fun and non-over bearing fashion. Like all of the other veggietales videos they feature computer animated vegetables as actors.The ballad of little joe tells the story of Joseph the youngest son of Jacob/Israel. It set as a modern western. The story takes place in Dodgeball City where the patrons contantly have to look out for randomly flying dogeballs.As I mentioned before the story follows the Genesis account of Joseph as modern western. I like the one line where Little Joe is kidnapped by a band of desperados and he says ""deperados you better come to your senses!"". This was a reference to the Eagles classic ""Desperado.""The belly button song is a classic."
2,Not as good as the rest,"This was ok, but I didn't like it as much as the rest of the Veggie Tales shows."
3,Yeah...I only gave it Three stars. Maybe 3.7 for Bellybutton!,"Yeah...I jusst found the movie kinda dull. I used to love it, but within ten minutes...I get bored. But I LOVE the song ""Bellybutton"" which is my second favorite silly song. (First is ""Pizza Angel"") It is weird, because I don't quite like this one, but I love Moe. Joe is still enjoyable though. It has funny parts and nice dialogue!"
5,A Song of Songs for this century.,"Wonderfully sensuous without being overtly explicit. Dobyns' rich illustrations serve Neruda's work well. I wonder if a man considered to be a ""poet for the people"" connected to the political lives of the working and the oppressed ever realized that so many of us would consider him to be such a romantic."
2,English Only? Bummer.,"I was hoping this would have both the original Spanish and translated English versions; instead it is English only. This takes away from the beauty of the poems, although the translators did a good job."
5,Without question...,"...one of the most beautiful sets of poems in the history of poetry. Exquisite is the only word to describe Neruda's images and language. I have read the poems both in English and Spanish and even though the Spanish version is, of course, far superior, the poems don't really lose much in these translations. Neruda is the ultimate, TRUE romantic and not the schlocky caricature that we've come to accept as the essence of romance. Neruda understood the human condition with regards to love and its consequences like few other poets and it shows in the magical beauty of his work."
4,Modern love poems,"Of course, these poems are best when read in their original language, as with all poetry. But I think Neruda is translatable, as much as a poet can be. It is easy to see why these poems appeal to all, or almost all, people who read them. They go directly to our feelings, as we all have some very special people in our past to relate them to (and people who don't have anyone to remember have certainly lived miserable lives).The language of Neruda is sophisticated, memories are convoluted, but so are all memories of love: sophisticated and distorted by memory, regret, nostalgia and longing for those loves to come back. They do when we read Neruda. He is not one of my favorite poets. I especially dislike his political (procommunist) poetry of later days. But I certainly enjoy reading his words and seeing the images he paints, the sounds he evocates, the smells that remain in the back of my head from earlier loves. Highly recommended for reading and re-reading."
4,Piano Roll,"I'm enjoying the music very much, however, I thought I was ordering an actual piano roll for an electric piano..... the CD ad was in the middle of several piano roll ads. My mistake but you were really nice and let me keep it to listen to this great ""old"" music which I'm doing right now! I thank you very much.."
1,I HAVE A DREAM has been altered in this text!,"This text includes Martin Luther King, Jrs I HAVE A DREAM--and it has been changed! Words, phrases, whole sentences have been omitted! Some words and phrases have been rewritten, changed! These changes alter the meaning of many aspects of the text! My students and I just discovered this while reading the speech and watching the video. I am HORRIFIED! And my students and I are contacting the publisher, the NAACP, the King family--and anyone else we can think of. What kind of academics is THIS?! Talk about appropriating history!"
5,Awesome addtion!!!,"This cap fit my 2000 GMC Sierra 4.8L 4x4 perfectly! I use Mobil 1 Synthetic 5w30 and this was a perfect addition to the overall look of my truck AND it reminds the service techs to use Mobil 1. Thanks Amazon for carrying this product! Shipping was fast as usual!UPDATE~ For those wondering if this will fit something other than the Corvette, well I am here to tell you IT WILL! It fit my truck with no issues. Looks great in the engine bay as well. Now I will be ordering the1993-1996 Corvette Mobile 1 Underhood Emblemto go along with this oil cap."
5,"Brilliant, contemplative, thought provoking","This is a fascinating documentary symphony composed by Edward Burtynsky working in large format photography mixing urban and industrial images in a melange of spoiled nature, human effort, movement between black and white and color. The shots of the ship salvage yards of Chittabong, Bangladesh , the Shanghai cityscape and the Three Gorges Dam leave one awash in contemplation and wonder; alone with your thoughts about Earth's future and your children."
4,a good documentary,"I saw this in the theater and loved it. While this DVD does not include many bonuses it is, at least, affordable.The documentary works, I think, like an artist statement. The viewer gets a strong sense of what inspired the artist, and how he understands his works' relevance to society.The artist, if not obvious from the amazon description is primarily concerned with post industrial landscapes. This means functioning and abandoned factories, gravel pits, computer waste sites. The most savory image in the documentary is, I think, a small Chinese village where a group of older citizens stand hunched over gigantic mounds of computer waste. Each mother board is heated until all the salvageable metals are stripped."
2,Slow and Boring,"This movie is created mostly based on slides and photos. It is incredibly slow with very little commentary. From the very beginning, it shows a huge Chinese factory floor for six to seven minutes with no comment nor music. The camera just walked through the entire floor from one end to the other. You can actually fast forward through the entire movie without missing much.The deleted scenes and comments were more interesting than the movie itself. If you are interested in environmental photos, this may be for you. I would not recommend this to friends."
1,CRUSHINGLY BORING,"BORING BEYOND BELIEF. I couldn't even give this DVD away to other photography teachers -- they kept giving it back. If I can find an insomniac, this will make an effective gift. Don't waste your money. Crushingly boring waste of time."
3,"Unconventional documentary film approach, borrow over buy","I had heard tremendous praise for Manufactured Landscapes, but was underwhelmed by my first viewing. It provides an excellent visual to go with many things that we often read about environmental concerns in China, but the way it is put together is a little too raw/artsy for my liking. However, because of its almost unedited style, the film does give some insight into the on-the-ground production work that goes into photographing/filming work like this. This is particularly true in the cases of photographs that you can hear being staged, rather than being captured in a ""real-life"" situation.Overall the video is definitely worth a watch, but I would have been happier to have checked it out from the library than to have purchased my own copy."
2,No comments,"Some pretty nice footage, but absolutely no useful narration. I guess the film crew just wants the story to tell itself as if that was possible. The film is obviously edited and I consider it dishonest and arrogant not to narrate it. We all would learn so much more about the world with a factual narration. I suppose the film crew just doesn't know what is going on. Instead we get appeal to emotions and aesthetics. This subversive and emotional film reminds me of Riefenstahl'sRiefenstahl Olympiain its approach.I can give more details but I really just want to scare you away. If you after reading this review still think you like it I have no problem with that either."
1,Canadian Import - wait for the better US version!,I did not know the DVD was a Canadian import which is not has good as I expected.I've heard the US DVD will be much better....It's better to wait and get the US DVD...
2,Clunky,"The best word to describe the Axiom 25 is *clunky*. I bought the bright, gaudy yellow one and while I really wanted to like this keyboard, I just couldn't. Everything it makes up for in looks, it lacks in quality due to the key bed being so clunky. I've got to turn up my monitors or wear headphones to drown out the horrible clacking keys. The 8 percussion pads and 8 endless rotary knobs are a redeeming factor though, and for the price I should probably complain a little less. However if I could do it all over again I would choose something else, or at the very least not purchase it blindly without trying it first.All the features of this controller are great, but the terrible keys outweigh the benefits."
2,Think Twice,Control buttons are difficult to assign and no printed manual. At this point I regret buying this product and will never recommend it.
4,A really good keyboard to start with.,"I just bought this keyboard yesterday. I played around with for about 3 hours last night. So far it's everything I wanted it to be and more. It's one of the few midi keyboards that has trigger pads on it I've seen. The Enigma software from M-Audio is very easy to use. I mainly use Fruity Loops 5 so I have to spend some time to get the settings right. All the keys are very accurate to pressure you hit the keys with. It's very lightweight, maybe about 5 or 6 pounds. A very good buy for the price."
4,Great controller,"This controller is great, this is an outdated version, I'm sure the new one in the line is good also. The key to this and all controllers is to have a beefy enough computer that eliminates audio lag."
2,Windows XP users,I bought this to use on my Windows laptop running XP. It wouldn't show up on the mixing software provided and apparently it has not been approved for XP operating system according to both the driver that came with it and the driver technical service at M-Audio sent me. All in all Mac users are probably better off using this Midi as oppose to Windows users.
4,solid buy,"great product. super easy set up and is everything i was expecting. that said, it does not come with a manual like everyone else is saying, but you can get one off the axiom site, so who cares. im new to midi so taking advantage of everything this has is pretty hard, but not worth complaining about. anyone who says this isnt worth buying is too lazy to learn how to use it"
5,excellent movie,"The first I saw this movie I was thirteen, it always stayed in my mind. I'm glad I was able to buy it, 'cause the previous tape was in bad condition. After all this time the movie is still great to watch, with a nice couple of actors (of which one dutchie :)and a superb Rampling)."
4,Fantasies of domination,"In this explicit erotic comic, Cecilia is a beautiful blonde who finds herself perpetually shocked, shocked at the handling given to her by the residents of two fantasy worlds--the aristocrats and savages of a medieval kingdom, and a perverse husband who enlists her in modern-day sex games.While this is definitely an S&M fantasy, it probably would appeal to many people who usually like more their erotica more vanilla--Cecilia is never really hurt, and the dream-within-a-dream structure emphasizes that all of her adventures are just fantasies. One is definitely meant to identify with the heroine more than with her abusers.If you like this sort of thing, or sometimes wonder if you might, this is definitely worth checking out: The art is well-done and fairly realistic, and the settings and situations show consistent imagination."
4,Interesting little book.,"Full-Colored adult graphic novel.Strange novel with no words, just pictures until the very end. There are two stories. The first story involves a woman back in colonial times who is found on the side of the road nearly nude, attacked by passers by (or she is their slave), freed/captured by indians, the woman escapes the indians and is recaptured by the white fellows . . . During this time the woman dreams of another existence, this one set in the modern world. The second story involves a woman in the ""modern"" time period who unexpectedly finds herself a sex slave. Both women dream of each other, it would seem. Though not everything is as it seems. ..The drawing is quite good, nothing appears to be censored. Much bondage, whipping, punishment, sexual activity, and dominance.The plot is driven along by the pictures and is interesting enough in its method. Overall, an odd, yet good ""novel."""
1,Dream of C.,It is to bad such talented illustrations are in the context of such degrading situations
3,Good storyline with some very funny scenes...,"A little slow in the beginning with some over-the-top acting, but gradually the story begins to come together. Some good acting by relative unknowns. Kevin Farley, like his brother Chris, makes a great ""buddy"" and plays the frat-boy role well. Somewhat like a Saturday Night Live skit, some scenes go farther than they should to get a laugh. Otherwise it's a film that makes you laugh and smile and feel good at the end. It reminded me of ""The Sure Thing""."
1,Terrible Movie- PERIOD,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE unless you enjoy ghastly movies.Silly but not funny.Cheaply made without redeeming quality of any kind.Chris Farley is not in this film.
4,Awesome Bad Movie,"This is one of those movies that you criticise whenever you're thinking logically...even though you secretly love it when you've got a night alone and feel like watching a movie.The acting is...passable. The writing is on the same level. The plot is downright silly, but enjoyable at the same time. Enough money went into this picture to leave nothing missing from sound, special effects, or set pieces. The holes in the plot are huge, but the producers seem to have gone with the ""if you can't hide it, feature it"" school of thought. It's left as an open-ended, figure-it-out-yourself closing at the end (don't try TOO hard).Look, I'm not going to argue that this movie will be remembered in 50 years. All I can say is I've watched it about 10 times, with everyone from army buddies to a range of girlfriends, to family, all the way to friends from school and training...and it's always a great movie for a rainy night in.Worth the price. Fun."
2,A bunch of nonsense,"I was really looking forward to this movie, all my friends were saying how good it was. Then i finally got to watch it and found it to be very boring. First off they shouldn't have put so many twists in, it got confusing at times. Then John should't have been in their and made it kinda a love story slash army story romance isnt always needed. Their is nothing i hate more then a hard core army story mixed with love it just doesnt work. Then the end was weak some may say it was good but it was a very weak plot. It was just thrown in to make people happy oh noone died how nice. Well this movie gets a yank yank not worth the time of the day."
3,The 8 Ball,"John McTiernan&#65533;s &#65533;Basic&#65533; is very loud: 80% of the dialogue is shouted; a hurricane is blowing during most of the movie and the lighting and set décor screams Army camouflage at you relentlessly.But I suppose if you were going to cast any two actors to scream and yell their heads off during an entire film, no two actors could do that better than John Travolta (looking slim and trim) and Samuel L. Jackson.The plot is intriguing for about 60% of this film until the incomprehensible twists and turns and twists and turns again start to make it seem like a poor man&#65533;s version of &#65533;The Usual Suspect.&#65533;Travolta and Jackson&#65533;s charisma makes up for the lack of a coherent screenplay for a while but even they are not able to make this thing work 100%.Chalk &#65533;Basic&#65533; up to a good try but no cigar, guys."
3,Too Gimmicky But Entertaining,"I enjoyed this movie even though the plot twists and turns were mind-boggling and gimmicky. The action is fast-paced and the mystery is tantalizing even though the way it is worked out is pretty hokey and very confusing. I watched this movie four times before I finally had it (mostly) put together and then some of it is still contradictory . Having said all that, I would still recommend it because it is fun being surprised (even with bogus and non-sensical surprises) and the performances are pretty good. Travolta's character suited him, Connie Nielsen was adequate but boring, Samuel L. Jackson was his usual very loud self, Giovanni Ribisi (a really interesting actor usually) hammed it up., Tim Daly and Harry Connick, Jr. were there mainly for recognition purposes, and the lesser stars were more than able to hold their own with the luminaries. However, if you want a good Travolta movie, I'd recommend Domestic Disturbance."
1,"Travolta is cool, His movie choices arent","Im not a huge fan of Travolta but i dont hate him eitherOther than Pulp Fiction i dont own any other Travolta films and wouldn't buy any either. Get Shorty comes close, his performance is good but the film just falters and eventually isn't that great.Pulp Fiction supposedly revived his career and since then I haven't seen anything that has brought it up againThis film suckssuckssucksNot a zero star movie, it deserves the onebut anyone who owns it not only really enjoys terrible films, but really loves has been actors in their worst roles.TRAVOLTA- Call Quentin you need him againP.S Saturday Night Fever and Grease may be classics to some people but i find them:GAY!men in tights dancing is not my idea of a well rounded superbly acted dramatic film that i can enjoy repeatedlythose films remind me of films such as Dirty DancingGay men and women may love them and they may be considered classics in their own rightbut they are GAYface it"
3,Basic who done it mystery,"Yep this is one of those movies that anyone could have done it after you figure out what was done. Actually John Travolta did a pretty convincing job.During a training mission in Panama, Sgt. West (Samuel Jackson), an unloved leader type, is killed along with some collateral damage. Tom Hardy (John Travolta), the renegade type, is called in to investigate. He is teamed up with rookie investigator Osborne (Connie Nielson), no chance at chemistry type. We get led around by our nose as information mysteriously appears during the several conflicting stories (several conflicting flashbacks). There are a few good shoot-em-up scenes. You have seen this before and you know the drill (maybe). Naturally last minute clues that were too dangerous to tell you sooner appear near the end of the movie.If you enjoy this type of movie I suggest you watch ""Courage Under Fire"" (1996)"
3,no female rangers,"Not a bad movie, but once again, Hollywood strikes out again, in its portrayal of the military.To educate the movie watchers out there who don't know much about the military: There are no female infantrymen OR Rangers in the US Army. There are no women in combat arms fields either. Watch the movie for its twists and suprise ending, but bare in mind, the babe in the jungle never could be a Ranger."
4,"Entertaining, but confusing",I thought this was a good movie. Very entertaining. But it get's really confusing with all the plot twists and plot holes it has throughout the movie.
4,People Love To Hate This Film,"When I first saw Basic I was expecting a typical mindless action flick, instead I got an decent attempt at a sinister almost psychological thriller. There are plenty of twists and turns, some are predictable but some are genuinely suprising.Both John Travolta and Samuel Jackson are slated for taking poor scripts, but I don't think this is as bad as say, SWAT. In fact I thouroughly enjoyed watching Basic, two big stars both with a certain presence to them certainly helped. I won't give away too much of the plot, its better if you go into this film without a clue, the twists are that much more credible.I really can't see why so many people feel the need to moan about this film. Its sad that a lot of these 1 star reviews are from people who just have a grudge against Travolta or Jackson, just read them, hardly any say why the actual film is poor but slate the actor."
2,Ultra-Contrived,"This flick was so convoluted and ultra-contrived that I have to think the only purpose the director had in mind was to totally confuse and deceive the viewer into a narcoleptic trance. Absolutely devoid of flow, and even though the action sequences are bearable, after the third or fourth flashback- you just find yourself thinking what else is there I could be watching instead."
2,Didn't work at all,"This film tried hard, but it kept missing. The pacing of the film is way, way too fast. The twists and turns of the story are fired at you bullet-style and I just couldn't keep up. When the end finally arrived, I STILL didn't know what exactly had happened. There were critical scenes missing which would have tied it all together. Too many things didn't add up. Inconsistencies galore. And I don't know what the other reviewer meant by John Travolta being ""slim and trim"" here-- he looked fat and bloated to me, and showing his age. He always plays the young cocky guy in every one of his films, but in this one he is the washed-up, ex-cocky guy, which I guess is perfect since he can't keep up with the younger crowd now. Jackson plays the usual loud-mouth character, so there wasn't any real surprise there, either. All things considered, I recommend skipping it entirely. There are far better ""thrillers"" out there."
5,MOST CONFUSING YET BEST FLICK EVER,"this movie is basically (ha get it basically-basic)about an investigation on a missing sergeant who disappeared in a routine training op in a hurricane on one of the Panama Islands. There are so many twists and turns to this great story you will go away from it with your brain aching saying....""wow"" i highly suggest renting or buying this DVD."
3,Worth Watching Once...,"This is a good story if you can stomach the winding plot, which takes several sharp turns throughout the movie, making it a little hard to follow at times. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson give good performances and this is probably one of the best performances I've ever seen from Sharon Stone. She's quite believeable in her role as an Army captain. However, like many military films, this one takes some great liberties with what does and doesn't happen in the military, but it's fiction, so it's excusable in its context."
2,Fair movie with lousy ending,"SOME of the acting is good, if you can overlooked the fact that the provost Marshal's accent comes and goes in every other scene, but the ending ruins a fair movie.WIthout giving away the ""twist"" if you accept that the ending, then the entire rest of the film makes no sense what-so-ever. If your one of those people who asks ""then why would he have done that?"" DONT see this movie."
2,Who's on First?,"This film spins around and around and around.... First its a murder mystery, then its a conspiracy thriller then its a psychological thriller then it turns into something else entirely at the end.The producers of this goofy film forgot the basics of filming mysteries: audiences enjoy them more if you actually give them clues and offer up logical plot twists. This mess does'nt do any of that."
2,Why they think we are so na?ve?,"There isn?t really much to talk about; it is a very twisted plot that you may simply twist it again to produce another 10 or 15 minutes or un-twist it once to make a 50 minutes episode of a bad TV series; and if you want to go for 180 minutes' movie? It is still possible; you may simply re-invent another doubled personality (Samuel L. Jackson or John Travolta this time) and we run into the circle once again.One explosion that has been repeated 3-4 times in the movie (I lost the count) to restart the story; and in each time (beginning), there is a missing knot and a weak re-sequence of the incidents. Oh, but the sound of the explosion was well-produced!"
2,Basically a mess,"The thought of trying to explain the plot of this movie is exhausting. In fact, I don't know if I could even if I tried. A bunch of soldiers go into the jungle; only two come out--maybe. Or maybe not. The plot twists and twists until it finally has no shape. Even if I could have understood it, the characters are given little-to-no development or backstory, so I simply didn't care what happened to whom or why. I'm a smart and patient viewer, but I felt like this movie wasted my time being convoluted instead of clever."
1,At least the title is appropriate,"An average murder story where the plot is about trying to find who killed the members of a special military unit. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson get togheter again after ""Pulp Fiction"", but the movie just goes on forever, endlessly...A souless, pointless thriller whose only interesting element is the ending twist, but not even that can save the state of boredom created by the previous moments. A turkey."
3,Suspenseful Military Mystery,"This film is interesting and suspenseful the entire way through. Both clever and well written it tells the story of a military training mission gone wrong from the perspective of several different officers. The cast of characters are great with the best performances by John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Giovanni Ribisi and Harry Connick Jr.If you are looking for a military movie this will satisfy you but it takes more credit as a murder mystery. It is gripping, intriguing and a great whodunit with a twist that is unpredictable at the end. Highly entertaining and well worth the ride."
2,okay john take your shot,"this movie had a good cast but not a pretty name (Basic) plus the plot was simple as if it was already done or something not the very best but the reason i gave it 2 stars was because of aaceptional acting from john and samuelp.s. you guys could do better than this....another p.s. dont see basic save your money for another moviefrom, ben n."
3,Whiplash,"There are so many twists and turns in this plot that the viewer is bound to end up with the moviegoer's version of whiplash. Without the admirable performances of Samuel Jackson and John Travolta, the labyrinthine turns of plot here might turn what at first promises to be an interesting story to dust, but the Jackson/Travolta team (not that they are on screen together...) and the riveting and plummy-voiced Giovanni Ribisi save the film from the trash-heap. In the end, though, the viewer is bound to feel that the makers of the movie had the advantage and the audience-members are merely the pawns in their hands.Also, except for one rather violent scene when the Connie Nielsen character draws a gun on Travolta (who says deadpan, ""I guess that means 'no'""), the love interest in the movie basically goes nowhere. Too much of the female interest here comes simply from seeing women act as violent and macho as men can act -- not a very interesting portrayal of the ladies."
1,limbo,how low can Travolta sink. Basic is just another agonizing nail in his coffin. This movie rates near Battle field earthfor it's ability to grate on your nerves.Rent it with a lot of friends and split the cost. A dollar is all it is worth to see this mess.
3,Movie Deserves Better Reviews,"This is getting low reviews and it doesn't deserve them.... completely. the movie, especially the ending, is surprising. We never really know what's going on although we think we do. regular movie goers will probably be able to tell SOME of what is really happening (you may be able to guess fairly early who the bad guy really is if you see a lot of movies) but even if you guess a LOT, the ending will still provide many surprises for you and the ending will make you WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE AGAIN FROM THE BEGINNING. Go ahead because it is better the 2nd time."
5,"An Intellectual, Twist-y Thriller","While this film is being marketed as a pretty standard 'war/basic training' movie, it's anything but -- more like a really good ""Law & Order"" episode meets ""Jag"". We stumbled into it when it was the only thing left at the multiplex, and were very pleasantly surprised by the performances and a script with several twists and turns you really can't outwit. A handful of marines have been murdered on a training exercise, and the suspects and motives are multiple. A smart, sexy, interesting film."
3,BASICally plot twist-o-rama.,"This flick starts out well but eventually get too confused for it's own good. The first fifty minutes was a pretty engaging military drama/thriller that gets the viewer guessing what version of the truth is a lie. Then it gets complicated beyond repair. The filmmakers had a good thing going but threw in way too many twists, leaving the viewer with an understanding of what happened, just somewhat confused on why so many deceptions had to take place to get there. If you liked the twistiness of WILD THINGS you'd like this flick, which I found too busy twisting to be delivering genuine thrills and strong plot."
3,One twist too many,"John Travolta stars in this slick film about the death of an unpopular sergeant while on training maneuvers in Panama. Nothing is as it seems in this film, as Travolta and a female sidekick interrogate survivors of a massacre and each person they talk to gives a different story. The action is almost impossible to follow and I'm still not sure what the final twist really signified. Film makers were really too clever in this movie and their attempts at twists and turns really spoiled it."
3,kinda like it,i didn't find allot to like about this other than the brief action scenes. i didn't find it very fun but i kinda like it.
1,Avoid this book,I have always been crazy about Millhiser's books but this is the exception. A zillion Characters (and I really mean character with a capital C) and an obtuse plot make this hard to follow. There is no way I can recommend this book. Buy The Mirror instead.
3,darth vader chopprerr...I like it,"I got collection of model motorcyle,this is perfect for my collection.mock it now,but,20 years or is going to worth some $$$"
1,"Bad Hasbro, Bad!!","Send Hasbro a message and don't buy this garbage. Stores can't keep basic figures in stock and yet these worthless wastes of plastic are taking up valuable shelf space. Kids and collectors alike hate this product.If you're a parent looking for a Star Wars toy for your kid, stick to the figures, movie vehicles, Galactic Heroes, anything else but this. I saw a couple of kids mocking this thing at Target last week and then move onto the Power Rangers because there weren't any ""cool"" Star Wars toys in stock even though they wanted some."
4,something rolling!! something not quite.....,"...the rolling being ""full contact"" a track by some obscure people/persons called the Bell Air Project!! (some what enigmatic as i couldn't find a single, album: nothing!! not even here on amazon!!!) There are quite a few stand out tracks from the likes of Le Gooster, Diferenz, Skrapel and Mas-p!! Where the plot loses itself is with things like the last track by 4D and others that to my mind should have been cut: most of them not even fitting into the drum and bass style, as the disc proclaims itself a compilation of! The french crew Minus 8 seem to have chucked in the odd rubbish really as fillers rather than keeping to the really fly examples present on the album. the disc should get a three but based on the ""full cantact"" track its really worth the four stars: worth checking out just for that if you can get your handz on it!!"
1,AVOID,"I feel a compelled to warn all parents that the content in this software is far too graphic for children. The fairy tales are completely altered and disturbing. In one setting a hunter cuts own the stomach of a wolf to remove Little Red Riding Hood and her Grandmother. Although you don't witness the carnage, the mental picture is distrubing. I trashed my copy within a day."
1,Fallacies of Halloween,"Yeah, yeah... the ""dread Lord Samhain"" myth rears it's ugly head again. There was no god called Samhain or Druidic sacrifices for it. Samhain is a celtic word meaning ""end of summer"" Halloween started as a Harvest festival. If he can't even get the origins of the holiday right, why bother believing a word of it? Ridiculous."
1,"Nonfiction, no. Propaganda, yes.","If you're looking for a thoughtful, serious, and balanced nonfiction treatment of Halloween, you will need to look elsewhere. While the title promises the facts on one of our more popular holidays, the book actually offers an unbalanced, fundamentalist Christian friendly ""interpretation"" (in heavy quotation marks) of Halloween.But take heart: if you like the idea that some people are afraid of what has become a very secular, nondenominational holiday and you're willing to pass on folkloric content, historical richness, and, finally, critical thinking to get it, this could well be the book you're looking for."
1,books like this are why I left the church,"There is no god called samhin most of the ""facts"" in this book aren't researched very well, most aren't true at all. Here is something I used to wonder when I was still an evangelical, Why are we picking on just Halloween when Christmas and Easter are also pagan? This book has done more to turn former evangelicals like me away from the church than it will ever draw newcomers to the church."
2,Good for a filtered history,"Too many times we find books written by Christians that think they're experts on certain topics because they've read the Bible. This has a nice but filtered history of Halloween. Unfortunately, halfway through the book, the authors get sidetracked & start to tackle every subject but Halloween. And then, after trying to prove to the reader that Halloween is evil & should not be participated in by any Christian, they give parents a list of things to keep you child safe if going out trick or treating. Halloween is not evil, & is a fun time of year. Some people just like to ruin it for the rest of us."
1,Christian Nuts on a rampage!!,"Buy this book if you are a religious nut. Otherwise, don't waste your money listening to their spin on an innocent holiday. Ohh, the devil is behind it all!!! Grow up!"
5,"Excellent, Factual Information","We purchased this little booklet about 12 years ago when we faced the decision of whether or not celebrating Halloween is something Christians should do. Nobody told us what to think or how we should respond. We researched the topic ourselves, and we found this booklet to be the most thorough explanation of the ""holiday."" If you are not a Christian, then don't bother reading this because it isn't something that concerns you. However, if you are Christian parents, and for some reason feel like there just isn't something right about celebrating Halloween, I highly recommend this booklet. Read it with an open mind and heart and let the Holy Spirit do the rest of the work in you. If you can read this and truly take the Scripture references seriously, pray about what God would have you do, and then still consciously participate in this pagan festival, then so be it. We surely couldn't!"
3,The Wall is your Friend,"The cheese factor of the introduction section of this DVD was insanely cheesy...almost to the point that I couldn't take it seriously. I'm glad I did manage to manage to sit through it and get on with the skills and drills, which I found very helpful (and more so, so did my son who started playing indoor soccer in addition to his outdoor soccer this year)."
3,Cute Book,"my niece loves all the different pictures... although, i found it a little too cluttered... informative and fun book for kids though"
3,Collecting dust,"My little sweetie is not interested in this book. I have a couple of others that seem to attract attention. But, this one doesn't do it. I can't say that I can blame, I wasn't really impressed with it either."
4,Great book but arrived in very non-environmentally friendly packaging,"The super large version of this book is very fun! I am going to try putting my baby on top of it for tummy time!My only complaint is that I ordered two of these books and they came SEPARATELY in two gigantic boxes with tons of filling. I felt really bad about what a waste of materials it was. They didn't even combine the two books into one box! Additionally, the boxes weren't super durable so not really reusable."
3,Not as good as the hardcover version,"My son has the hardcover version of this book and he loves it. I love reading it to him before bed because it takes him through a bunch of pages and then it winds him down with some poems and more subdued pages. I purchased the board book to give as a Christmas present to my niece who is only 6 months old, but when the board book arrived I was disappointed to learn that it is missing many of the best pages from the hardcover version. I am returning it and ordering the hardcover version to give instead."
5,"Everything Book has, well, everything",My granddaughter loved this title that I borrowed from the library. Bought a copy for her. She loves to find and count the ladybugs on nearly every page. A good concept book for pre-schoolers.
5,A Happy Read,I decided to purchase this book as a baby shower gift after reading a copy of it we checked out from the library.It is a happy book with big and bright illustrations. I liked that it contained poems that were not the same onesone finds in most children's books. Yet the poems are simple enough for us to memorize.This book is a great first book or a book to add to a children's book collection.
2,"""random"" book with no story and no theme","This is a random collection of pictures and phrases. I hardly think it qualifies as a book. There is no story and no theme to the book. The illustrations are lovely, but the text is confusing at best. Skip this one--it's not worth your time or money."
5,Going Back to Work....fabulous,"I recently checked this book out of the library and am I ever glad I did! As a stay-at-home mom and business owner, I think about what it will be like when my three kids are off in college and it's just me and my husband again. I tell my friends to ""get a life now because our kids will be gone one day,"" this book will definitely be read and reread as I go through this complex decision process. I'm now 40 years old and wondering what I want to do when I grow up, Going Back to Work will be a wonderful help with real life examples from all walks of life. It's an intelligent look at the real issues we all wrestle with as wives and mothers about our importance to our families and our contribution to our communities. I loved it and am recommending it to my friends and acquaintences."
2,A big disappointment,"Having read all of Dean Koontz novels to date I was greatly disappointed in this one. It starts out OK (just ok) moves on to ordinary and ends in way below average. It almost seems that the author reviewed it after 300 pages, decided it was a dud, and felt that he should end it as soon as possible. It won't put me off racing out to get his next one when it is released, but I wouldn't recommend this one to friend or foe"
3,It Is Not Scary When It is Unbelievable,"The best Dean Koontz books are the ones where the evil character could actually exist (ie, Intensity). That is scary. But this book is so lame with the New Age crap that you drift off reading it.As usual, Dean Koontz writes well, but the story line is dull. I like Koontz better than Stephen King, cause King's books never seem believable. Just gross horror.Entertainment Weekly gave Sole Survivor a grade of C-. That seems fair.P.S. I am very glad I got this book at the library....."
2,Not his best...,"After reading Dark Rivers of the Heart followed by Intensity, I eagerly awaited Dean Koontz's next novel. Disappointment is the word that comes to mind. I did not like the ending at all. It started good, was mediocre (at best) half way through and ran out of gas at the end. I wouldn't recommend this book to a ""first time"" Dean Koontz reader"
3,Why couldn't he have stopped with conspiracies after DROTH?,"Let's face it Koontz fans-the last genuinely great novel he published for our enjoyment was Dark Rivers of the Heart. Intensity was intense, certainly, but I prefer Dean's books that have a bit more meat to them (i.e. The Bad Place, Midnight, and of course the aforementioned Dark Rivers). As for Fear Nothing, Dean's latest, the plot is a rehash of Watchers, but is saved by a great main character. But the book was still a disappointment. Now back to Survivor. Entertainment Weekly (as I believe someone's already said on this review page) gave Survivor a C- review, and described the book as a "". . . lazy chase."" Lazy Chase is probably the most apt description for this book. But the C- was a bit unfair. C works for me. The scenes dealing with the suicides were downright chilling, and Joe's ""searching behavior"" seemed real. I also thought Rose was a cool character."
1,Worst Koontz book ever!,I listen to the audiotape of this book and was boring as the drive I was making (between Ely Nevada and Salt Lake City Utah). Dean Koontz is my favorite author but this is his worst book. The ending is very depressing.
2,Boring...,"I just got done reading Sole Survivor by Dean Koontz and was overall disappointed. I read and own his book Watchers (which I think is an awesome book) and this one no where compares to it. Sole Survivor starts out slow, which is understandable because it is building the story line, but throughout the book it never really picks up a whole lot. There is a lot of rambling, and I had to keep reading parts over again because I would get lost in all of the scientific and off-topic jargon and unneccesary details and descriptions. There are some really good parts in the book that get you to the ""edge of your seat"" and some really decriptive scenes that play well in the story, but all in all I was just really bored with it. I almost quit reading it several times, but managed to finish it. I probably won't read it again."
4,Open your Heart,"I very much enjoyed Sole Survivor because it allows the reader to enjoy the story on different levels. One level is Joe's struggle with the loss of his family and ultimate redemption at the realization that there is complexity and order in the universe, not just random chaotic events that are unstructured and meaningless. Another fascinating aspect of the book was the government research into and manipulation of paranormal activity for self serving interests. (wich most likely is really taking place) I will agree that this book had a hollywood ending, but I thought the entire book read like a movie script..and a very good one at that. Sole Survivor should be affirming to those with faith in good and God, as well as challenge the current thought process of those who lack it."
4,Excellent Tale About a Man Who Has Given Up On Life,"What is there to live for when the three closest people to you are suddenly taken away from you?Joe Carpenter is essentially dead inside, and on the one year anniversary of a plane crash that took his wife and two children, he is stuck in the rather monotonous lifestyle he has created for himself. He has quit his job, and is waiting to die.His monotonous routine is suddenly shaken when he encounters a woman who knows more about the plane crash than she certainly should. She is in fact a survivor from a plane crash that left no survivors.As Joe tries to unravel the mystery of this woman's presence, a quick page turner suddenly ensues as the plot unravels. A solid book from a great writer."
3,Not at his best..,"Being a fan of his work, Sole Survivor for me, is a disappointment.I agree with some of the other readers that it started off great, and i was initially excited waiting for that moment of suspense that, unfortunately, never came. The story itself is quite loose, the plot is simple and the delivery is so draggy that i had to force myself to finish it. I have nothing but praise for Mr. Koontz, however this time, I am sorry to say that he failed to deliver."
3,Should have been shorter,"This was Dean Koontz number 31 for me. Previously I had tried to read it and never made it through before becoming overwhelmed with boredom. This time I managed it. The beginning is pretty good, and it's great towards the end, but there's a good sized chunk of middle that I had to force myself through. Some parts just dragged on and on, like when Joe was trying to meet up with Rose and was driving all over the place. I just felt like the book could have been a lot shorter. Like I said, towards the end it was very interesting and rather touching (I even cried a little). I would recommend that only already big fans read the book. But first, read the really good stuff, like Intensity, Twilight Eyes, and Whispers. Other favorites of mine include The Door To December, Lightning, Strangers, Watchers, Icebound, and The Funhouse."
2,Disappointing Read,"Starts out as an intriguing mystery. 18 chapters, and you want to keep plowing through to find out what happened to flight 353. Strange events begin to occur, but do not seem to throw the story off track - you are still intrigued enough to keep on going. In chapter 15, things start to get really wierd, and in chapter 16, the longest in the book, the explanation comes out, but it turns the book into 'strange tales of the supernatural' - not my thing. A very unconvincing and disappointing ending. A very disappointing read. I wasted my time. At least I only paid $1.66."
3,Suspenseful & gripping yes but....,"This was a suspenseful and gripping book. It keeps you interested and turning the pages right up until the last 100 or so pages but then it turns strange and sort of fizzles out. Its worth borrowing to read, but I am glad I didn't buy it."
2,Dissapointing,"I absolutely loved Intensity, so went to the bookshelves in search for another promising Dean Koontz thriller. How upset I was to find Sole Survivor, an attempt at fear that stopped short with his lack of beleivability. I feel so fooled, and am quite upset I wasted my money with such anticipation"
3,Not as good as INTENSITY,"I'm giving this book 3-stars because it does have a pretty good storyline and original plot. One problem with it is that most of the action occurs in the last quarter of the book, unlike in Koontz's other work, INTENSITY (which IMO is the best one of his yet) which grips you from the very start.My other gripe is the fact that the book's ending is laden with loose ends. This is a novel begging for a sequel... pretty much nothing is solved at the end. The problem is still there, and we're left wondering what in the world the characters are going to do now."
5,One of his best! Go out and buy it.,Sole Survivor was the first Koontz book i've read by him and I really enjoyed it. Since then i've read others by him and have enjoyed them very much.I thought that the ending was very good.
2,So this is Dean Koontz?,"The first half of this book is fantastic. I really enjoyed huddling under the blankets on my bed, afraid to look into the corners of the room for fear of seeing something spooky...Unfortunately, the second half of the book became formulaic and predictable and the ending is so rediculous, it reads like satire. For those who like to wait for the final few pages to discover what happens, this is the book for you. For those who look for resolution that, while not terribly plausible, at least makes sense, then avoid this book. There is enough style evident in Sole Survivor to make me want to check out some of his other stuff."
4,Excellent page turner.,Having not read a Koontz book for a while I found myself being absorbed into the plot just as I had in the past. The storyline is one that will keep the pages turning. Enjoy.
5,Good stuff from a great author,I have read many Koontz books in the past and have come to consider this one of my favorites. The last two paragraphs of the novel summarize why this is such a great work of modern fiction. No one has the mastery over the English language and the ability to describe everyday thoughts and experiences in such a grand manner like Dean Koontz.
3,Keep at it Dean!,"I enjoyed Sole Survivor, but it certainly wasn't his best novel. Just when the story would start to become interesting and put you on the edge of your seat, the outcome would be a disappointment."
3,Sole Survivor,"I really enjoyed this one by Dean, but I was really let down by the ending. It seemed like he had run out of ideas for the story line and ended it with the simplest way out. I enjoyed the read but expected more out of it. Of all the koontz books i`ve read (which is almost all of them) i`ve found this one to be the first that left me wondering what he was thinking."
4,Koontz fans,"One of the things we enjoy about Mr. Koontz' writing is the detail he puts into it, helping to build the suspense. We didn't feel it was suspense-building this time, tho, as it seemed a little slow and we had a hard time staying focused through the first third of the audiobook. However, once the plot began to thicken, we were as drawn in as ever and couldn't wait to find out what happened next."
2,"The ""hero"" does too many stupid things!","I'm ex-military, ex-street-cop and ex-PI, and this book is so full of ""investigator nonsense"" it was aggravating. Very aggravating. It was also chock full of ""FLUFF"", namely unusually long descriptions of unrelated (or almost unrelated) stuff. Basically the author hasn't a clue of how ""real investigators"" operate and tries to make it up like an old lady might. If you like well written fluff filled nonsense, it's OK. But if you want your fiction to be believeable, forget this one."
4,"Even better than ""Intensity""!","This book was even better than Intensity, wich i though it wouldn't be. Here Koontz builds up a completely undisputably story wich includes shere scenes of sciencefiction, and makes it totally believable, and just when you are about to think that this episode was the book's klimax, Koontz take you to a higher level. Maybe it was a little boring in the beginning, or is it just my opinion? Anyway, it gets better as you go on, and the end is an unbelievable crescendo in real Koontz-fiction spirit. Read it and you'll not regreat it, one of the best books i've ever read!"
3,"slow beginning, great middle, slow ending","The book started off slow, in fact, I started reading it then put it down, and months later picked it up again. Once you get through the beginning, it is very good. I couldn't wait to read more. Then the ending lost me. Maybe it was too ""science-fictiony"" for me. Not a great book."
3,Poor,"This book starts out good. Then half way through, you can figure out exactly where he is going. Then you waste your time reading how he gets to the point you have already guessed"
2,"Great opening, and great opening only...","Sole Survivor was the only Dean Koontz book I have read. Up until the middle of the book I was still thinking it was one of the best book I have ever read, but as the story went on and when the truth behind the mystery revealed, I found out it was actually one of the worst book I have ever read! Well, actually I should say one of the worst ending I have ever read. It was just like reading a poorly planned detective story, the mystery was fantastic because the truth behind was unreasonable!"
1,Bad Ending,"The problem was the ending. I felt let down because I was expecting something a little more original than a child whose special power is helping the world ""see"" the existence of God and the afterlife. I mean, c'mon. I read 400 pages for THAT.We already have a book that addresses these issues: it's called a bible."
3,Not one of his best but will hold me over till his new one,I have been reading his books since the days of him writing under a different name. I am sad to say that this was probably one of my least favorite books of his. I cannot put my finger on it but I do no he spent way to long getting to the point of the book. Oh well there's next time.
2,Eh nothing great,I just finished reading Sole Survivor. The first 3/4's of the book was great. But when the plot unfolded I was majorely disapointed and wish I hadnt wasted my time reading it. I thought it was going to unfold into something better. But I guess if your into robots then you wont think this is that bad. Thats all I can say. I recommend definately getting this from the library then the books store just in case you had the same reaction I did.
2,Very Disappointing,"I was so excited when I found this Dean Koontz book because I am a new found fan of his.As you see from the description of the book, it sounds great - and it was great...until the end.The whole mystery surrounding the plane crash is very interesting once Koontz reveals it...but he waits until the very end to explain the mystery. He doesn't develop the plot twist, and then the book is over leaving a lot of unanswered questions.If you want a great Koontz book, try Odd Thomas."
2,Drag on,I don't mean to be critical or anything and i'm not sure about the rest of you but i've never known a book go so slowly i mean it took 250 pages or there about to get past 24 hours i then gave up and gave it to my teacher as she said Stephen King recomended him and she liked his works.When she gave it back to me i asked her what happened after such and such she said you stopped at the wrong part it gets so amazing. I asked her about rose i and how she survived the crash and she said this company had made children and this particular child could transport people or things to other dimensions which is what happened and she said the reason people kept commited suicide was because another child could control peoples mind and he was forced to. I gave this book a 2 which is alot considering the amount of rubbish i read the only reason i did was because of the rest of the bookMy First And last of Koontz's books
2,Koontz has lost his abliity to write an excellent book,"I am sorry, but this book was a disapointment to me. I have been a Koontz fan for over six years, and as time goes by his books are loosing their quality. There is too much description in this book, it drags severely in the middle, and all the supporting characters are severely underdeveloped. Koontz used to write his characters so well the reader came to know them ""personally"", that's not the case in this book. If I didn't know what Koontz is capable of I wouldn't be so dissapointed. By far, his older works are better."
2,Started out strong...,"I was pulled into the book immediately, felt sympathy for Joe and great interest in what would happen next. Initially it was a real page-turner. What happened was the book deteriorated into metaphysical twaddle and I reluctantly plodded through the last section. Very disappointing."
4,Wow,"Dean Koontz is a master of twists and turns and thrills. I loved this book. If you like Dean Koontz or thillers, then this book is for you!"
3,A thrilling thriller,"This book was thrilling. A child, a mysterious woman and Joe Carpenter kept this story on the run. This story will keep you on our toes. A mysterious picture, the government, a child, a doctor and an underground group of people give this story a back bone that makes chills run up your back when you consider how likely something like that could happy. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good thrilling book to send their minds running to kepp up with it."
4,"It's pretty good, but not his best work","This was the first book by Dean Koontz that I have read ( it was assigned reading ) and at that time I thought it was excellent. Since then however, I've read three more of his works. Sole Survivor was not on the same level as Mr. Murder, Watchers, or The Door to December, all of which I highly recomend. The plot soon became predictible and even boring in some places. The ending seemed rushed and incomplete. If you haven't already become a fan of Mr. Koontz work, this will probably get you hooked. If you have, this may dissapoint."
3,somewhat anticlimactic,"i thoroughly enjoyed this book right up until the very end. a riveting and thought-provoking story overall. i wasn't sure what to expect in terms of an ending, but i was a bit disappointed by how koontz did this one. still, anything of his is worth a look in my opinion."
2,Not if you are bothered by scientific illiteracy,"I liked the first two Odd Thomas books so decided to give this one a try. The book starts off ok but around page 340 the story takes a turn that almost made me put it down.Although it is not essential to the plot the author spends a couple pages proselytizing for ""scientific"" creationism. I'm as willing as the next to suspend disbelief in the interest of a good ghost story but here the author goes beyond that to insert a view that mirrors a growing scientific illiteracy in the U.S. If you are upset with the attempts of the religious right to subvert science education you might want to skip this book."
1,From a Dean Koontz Fan - This is worst of his work,I have read many Dean Koontz books...and this one is certainly the least enjoyed. The book started out good...in fact it was interesting for the first 1/2 to ALMOST 2/3rds...but I grew tired of the story line. The ending was confusing...and the plot and presentation...simply did not seem typical of Dean Koontz. If you want to start reading Dean Koontz...please do not read this one... If I had read this one first...I probably would never read anything more from Dean. This book was tough to get through....And I read about 50 books a year. Feel free to send me an email to respond to comment if you would like. I just didn't understand who the girl was at the end of the book-named Nina...but it wasn't his Nina.
4,If You are Afraid of Flying....,"In a reading lull, I have been picking up some of my favorite Dean Koontz books and giving them another go, much to my delight many are as good as I remember. This is one of them. Remarkable research on ""survivor guilt"" made this even a more interesting read. It was suspenseful without being nail biting frightening (Intensity).Enjoy the read!"
4,Definitely started off great,"Joe Carpenter has never recovered from the grief after a plane crash killed his wife and kids. He meets a woman who claims to have survived the catastrophe, but their weren't any survivors. When she disappears, Joe tries to track her down and verify the things she said. This is another Koontz book with a shadowy conspiracy and government secrets, and it has one of the best openings of any books I read in 1997, when it was published. The book gets lots along the way a little, but it comes back together near the end. Four stars out of five."
3,"Interesting read, 4-5 chapters of good suspense.",This was the first Koontz novel I read. It was recommended as being similar to Crichton and it was. Koontz got a little bogged down in description and had a tendency to go to the extreme of realistic situations. Overall I was moderately entertained but was disappointed with the ending
3,A little too supernatural,"I couldn't keep my interest so I would read in small sections, and I found myself confused at times as to whether I was in the story's reality or imaginary world. Well-written but hard for me to stay focused on it."
2,I tried,I really tried to like this book. I am a fan of Dean Koontz but after four years since I bought this I still can't finish it. I was almost to the middle and still waiting for something explosive to happen but it didn't. It was not as entertaining as other books by Dean that I have read and enjoyed. There was a movie based on the book and I tried watching that and ended up changing the channel. Maybe I will try to read it again and see what happens.
2,My First Koontz Reading,"For the first 15 or 16 chapters of Sole Survivor, I was intrigued and interested. I found myself, as I usually do, trying to visualize where the story was going and continuing to read to confirm what I was feeling. When the story finally got to the point of enlightening the reader about the engineered children at Technologik, I found myself thinking, ""I didn't think of that one."" The main part of the story that disappointed me was the last couple of chapters. The story just ended when I felt the was more that needed to be explained. There were too many gaps from being chased out of the cabin through the woods and then all of a sudden on the beach when the story ended. It left me wanting to know more....."
2,Not Koontz's best.,"Okay, emotional? Yes. Engaging? No. This is perhaps Koontz's WORST story ever. And yes, I'm a hardcore Koontz fan. I finished it ONLY because I hate not finishing books. Save your cash, folks. I wish I had."
3,"Not Bad, but Dean can definitely do better!","Sole Survivor is the only Dean Koontz book that I have had to make myself read. Usually after the first two chapters his books take on a ""cannot be put down until finished"" quality--not true with Sole. Throughout most of the book we are given Joe's mindless wonderings, then only a partial explanation of the experiments at the hospital in Virginia. If the child in that airtight chamber did those things with his mind, then keeping him enclosed in that chamber was no way to control him. This was a perfect example of cruel and inhuman punishment, and a definite resemblance to the treatment given a character in ""The Door To December (an early Koontz work)."" For me, the beauty of Dean's books are that they have a believable quality to them, I'm sorry but I found nothing believable in Sole. This book is a definite cure for insomnia"
2,Was this really Dean Koontz???,"Sole Survivor is one of Koontz's weaker books. It seems like a plot line he would have given us in the early seventies. The beach cult was rediculous, that kid held captive in the airtight chamber in Virginia was downright stupid, and the ending was an embarrasment to Koontz as a writer. That BIRD? What? The woods on fire? Any time a character in a Koontz novel feels the room grow cold and witnesses mysterious occurences there, the novel plummets. The good ones are the ones that are more down to earth and have a clever explanation (Like Watchers, Mr. Murdur, Dark Rivers, and Whispers.) Sole Survivor was a step backwards and sideways at the same time. I don't recommend it to anyone unless they seek a mundane experience"
4,His best work since The Bad Place,"After having been disappointed by Dean Koontz's last few novels, I find his new novel to be a very interesting read. The pace is fast, making me turn each page with anticipation.Instead of just finding out what happened to the plane crash, Koontz takes his readers on a roller-coaster ride, raising the puzzles of: Could someone actually survive the crash, what causes the mysterious deaths of those relatives of the victims, and of course, who is Rose Tucker?The ending is somewhat disappointing but the overall makeup is better than Intensity, Mr Murder, or Cold Fire.For readers who have just been introduced to the master of mystery, I also HIGHLY RECOMMEND his earlier works, Strangers, Watchers, Lightning, and The Bad Place.Some published under his pen names, such as The Mask, Whispers, Phantoms,and Night Chills, are also very entertaining."
3,"Say, what ??!??","Interestingly heartpounding at start, slowly confusing at middle part, building up to a big ""SAY, WHAT???"" towards the end. Not one I'd recommend but if you like unbelieveably supercalifragilisticexpialidocious characters, maybe this one's for you. As for me, I think I tried my best battling with my eyelids who were trying to shut after each chapter"
1,A promising start but a disappointing ending,"I was hooked at the start with the mysterious story of a man trying to figure out what really happened to his wife and daughters in a bizarre plane crash. But half-way through the novel Koontz ran out of gas and settled for a very contrived and boring ending. It reminds me of the action movies which rely on chase scenes and special effects instead of plot and character development to finish a good story. I'd like to see him go back and re-write the whole second half of the book but until then, I'm sorry I read it."
2,"Life, the Universe and Carpenter","What a letdown. And I thought Dark Rivers was bad. Firstly, there was way too much philosophical metaphysical rambling, and even the main character's name (Joseph Carpenter = Jesus Christ the carpenter) was tied into it. The ""is there a god"" question was beaten to death in this book. Secondly, the psychic children bit was straight out of Firestarter, and Mr. King must be delighted that his version was so much better. Finally, where's the resolution? Rose dies, the little boy remains locked up, tortured and torturing, and Joe still hasn't found peace of mind. BTW, a ""hero"" who's this violent is a dangerous person, and I think Nina should take him to see a good therapist. Everyone who read this book survived it, fortunately, but Mr. Koontz's reputation may not be so lucky"
1,Pretty Bad,"My first Koontz novel - and my last. His writing style is simply terrible. It is as if he were paid by-the-word. This same plot could have been rendered much more successfully in one-half the volume. Many times, I found myself chuckling and rolling my eyes at the flowery, repetitious over-the-top descriptions. Shows some promise at the very beginning, but soon loses everything"
1,This book was boring and is not worth $15.95,"This book was a disappointment to me because I was expecting something more interesting and exciting. You have to almost finish the book before it becomes interesting and then every thing moves too fast until you realize you are through reading the book. The desriptions of the forest and scenery was really unnessary, there were just too much about nothing, it made me feel like he was just trying to fill some extra pages so the book would be longer. This book could of been written in the last 4 chapters of the book because everything was summed up in the end and you really didn't need to read the whole book to find out what was going on. I am really upset about this book, I guess maybe he needs to slow down and take his time so he can writes better books, especially the books like he wrote a long time ago"
4,A QUICK READ,"AS I FAN OF KOONTZ I LOOKED FORWARD TO READING SOUL SURVIVOR. IT BEGAN SLOW BUT SOON I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. I USUALLY TRY TO PACE MYSELF AND HAVE A GOOD NOVEL LAST A WEEK OR TWO. I FINISHED THIS BOOK IN 3 DAYS. AS ALWAYS WITH KOONTZ I FOUND THE ENDING A BIT ABRUPT, BUT OVERALL I LOVED IT."
3,"Dean its OK, but not your best.","Having read all but 2 of Deans books I am a little disappointed with this effort. Of course I have come to expect much from Dean. Even so it was better than many other authors best efforts. Dean, we have a big need to get more of your very interesting mind set, but you need a different slant, he chuffled as he typed, you know what I mean?! Of course, if you had a www site and asked for ideas to transform into tomes, we could all help. Keep on working we love and need your creativity, impeccable style, and your product. Best Regards, Phil."
2,My 2nd Dean Koontz better than the first (but not much),"If you know Dean Koontz well and like his style, skip this review. It's mostly negative. Sole Survivor was my second Dean Koontz. The first was Dark Rivers of the Heart. I listened to both unabridged on audio while driving. I found Mr. Koontz's ""voice"" the same in both books - cliche-laden, with superficial characters and stilted dialogue. What I really liked about Sole Survivor was the ending - a burst of imagination with some really unique ideas."
3,"Good, but not that good.","I thought this book got off to a great start - I was hooked, and interested to know what happened to cause the death of Joe's family.When Joe discovered new evidence from the airline crash that killed his wife and daughters, the book rolled right along. That was until I found out the true cause of the plane crash, along with the identity of the mysterious 'sole survivor'.The ending was very disappointing and not at all believable - with vague, new Age mystical mumbo-jumbo. If the ending had been more credible, this could have been a really good book - but it seemed that this time Koontz was afraid of meeting his deadline and the ending was abruptly cut off.That said, this book is still fairly entertaining - just prepare for a somewhat unfinished rushed ending."
4,A gripping thriller,"It is difficult to review this book without giving out some of the best twists of the plot, but I'll try. The protagonist is mourning the loss of his wife and two daughters who perished in an airplane crash one year ago. He is visited by someone who appears to be a survivor with a promise of peace and comfort. The plot rapidly develops to include mind control, warring researchers, an evil corporation-and-government link, and much much more. It progresses very fast. In the end the widower gains some comfort although the ending, while uplifting, seemed incomplete and not fully satisfying to me. I would still highly recommend this book to any sci-fi or thriller fan."
3,sole survivor,I have not read a Dean Koontz book yet that I didnt loooove but about 3 qtrs thru this one I really got aggravated and kinda bored because it went into so much confusing terminology. I spent way too much time in dictionary.
4,Sole Survivor hooks you,Sole Survivor is a good read. Patterson hooks you and keeps you guessing until very near the end. Causes you to ask questions of yourself. An engaging story.
2,Buggy but promising,"I have to agree with all the negative reviews. I have a powerful machine, 3gh Intel processor, 1 gig ram, 256 mb geforce fx 5500 graphics card with the latest drivers. It runs (and plays) great for about 50 turns. But as more of the map is exposed it runs more and more slowly and eventually crashes. The game is fun, I enjoyed it as long as it ran. But I should have waited about 6 mo's for the patches."
1,Bug-o-rama,"""Deformed, unfinished, sent before my timeInto this breathing world scarce half made up""--Shakespeare Richard III, Act 1, Scene 1"
2,Buggy and slow,"For every good review you read, you must realise this game has major problems. I am running the followingAMD 4000+1gb PC 3200 ram low latencys-ata hard driveNvidia 6800 ultra 256mb graphics cardThe game is still too slow, and if I can't run it who can? Yes I have the game turned up on full graphics but my computer should be able to handle this easily. To top it all off, i was given the world map and suddenly the overload of information crashed the game on the next turn, followed by the fact I can no longer load any of the saved games of that session, it just crashes. Also please make a note of the hardware I am using, the wonder movies are jerky, the sound cuts out for 70% of the movie. I can play doom 3 perfectly but I can't play CIV IV"
2,Wait until the patch!,"I had this game running perfectly for two weeks and got a lot of enjoyment out of it. But then, stupid me, I had to go and download the latest ATI drivers and update my Radeon 9600. Now the game crashes.Only after the fact did I find out that tons of other people are having problems with the new drivers.I've rolled back, cleaned, and re-installed older drivers all to no avail thus far. Worst part is, I can't remember the previous driver version I had when the game was working properly.Darn you Civ Makers!!! These bugs are ridiculous!!!"
3,"Awsome game, frustrating bugs","I've yet to finish a game, haivng many of the technical issues described above. My system is well above the recommended level and yet I get crashes, usually toward the end of the game.Tweaking my system (big swap file etc.) has improved the situation a bit, but this game does not like to be played for extended periods of time and the longer a game goes on (even if you save and restart) the worse the situation gets. If you go past the time victory point the game becomes unplayable.Don't buy as an X-mas gift, you'll likey disapoint the recipient."
2,Civ IV Just Doesn't Make It,"I've had Civ IV since shortly after it came out but I'm still playing CivIII. This is not an improvement on version III, it's pretty much a whole new game that isn't anywhere near as good as III is. Yeh, it's got pretty pictures compared to III, but who needs them in this kind of game. It's not looks - it's Strategy!! The tech tree is now incomprehensible. It has elements of a fantasy game (the animals). But the worst thing is the lack of a real editor. The ""World Builder"" is available at any time during a game. With Civ III you lived with what you had in the way of resources, units, etc., once the game started. With this turkey you can go in at any time and add units, resources, whatever. Losing isn't possible anymore. That pretty much spoils it for me."
1,Civ Jumps the Shark,"The new features are fun. However, game play is TEDIOUS. The game takes forever to load (if it loads at all). Once laoded, each turn takes forever. The graphics are such that moving around the screen takes forever and the AIs take forever to complete thier turn. The time between turns is so long that its easy to get VERY bored with this game VERY fast.Then there are the Wonders movies which, for some reason, often cause my comptuer to crash.Civ 4 is a clear failure. Wait until Civ 5 when hopefully some of the problems will be fixed. That is if this franchise survives beyond this disaster."
2,blah...,"i picked up the last copy of this from my local bestbuy and its already off my hands. why? because it only took a few hours for me to go all the way through the game. some people have complained that it was too much micromanagement, but i felt it was really the opposite....a superficial game lacking any meaningful depth or strategy on the level of something truly great like medieval: total war. after i placed my settlers and staked out my cities, i pretty much just hit enter a billion times only stopping every now and then to research something new or build military units when threatened. hugely disappointing."
1,WAIT. DON'T BUY IT.,"I have been a fan of CIV games since CIV I. I haven't been able to play Civ 4 because the wold map is black. Checking CIV forums you will notice many other problems with different system configurations. Even with those that exceed the min requirements. Check the CIV forums first.Moreover, customer support is non existant. I have sent emails, checked the web page, and called tech support. Nobody shows up.Very disapointing. 2K Games needs to work harder to solve the many issues CIV 4 has. Wait at least 2-3 months."
1,"High Expectations, worst experience ever.","Ordered 2 games, both didn't work on 2 different brand new computers. Tried downloading the patch, then just gave up.They should be ashamed to release this game."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!,"Please, please, please do not buy this game! Firaxis has released a game that is only good on certain high end (T & L)video game cards. It has absolutely no intention of patching or reworking it for everyone else. Do not throw your good hard earned money away!!! Teach Firaxis a lesson for being so mercenary!"
1,Abysmal,"I pre-ordered this game like many other people. When I found it on my doorstep I was so excited to install and lpay the game! I got it installed after a couple minor glitches and started to play. I should mention, I have a fairly high end gaming machine. Even with graphics set to their lowest settings the graphics lag so bad I can hardly move the mouse. In addition, the game randomly crashes to desktop! There are massive memory leaks, after 15 minutes of trying to play, my page file was at over 2.4 Gigs and cimbing.This game should not have been released as it is. Does the ability of the internet to be able to patch games give developers the license to release games that are incomplete and *UNPLAYABLE*?I thank Firaxis and Take2 for the money I will save from not buying games in the future until they have been proven to work. No more pre-ordering from me."
3,Play no Civ before its time...,"I have a 2.6GHz processor with 2GB of RAM and an nVidia GEforce 5500 FX video card. The game was initially a huge disappointment due to the agonizing lag time. 2K games really dropped a bomb by releasing such a buggy product.That said, they have now released a patch (v1.09). By installing the patch, updating my video driver, and reducing the graphics to 'medium' I finally have this game playing at a decent speed. The patch still hasn't worked for a lot of people, though, judging by the messages on Civ fansites.Civ 4 has a lot going for it, and I am having fun with all the new features now that it is working on my machine. Check that your system meets the RECOMMENDED specifications (not minimum), and give the game a try. You can always send it back."
1,Worst Civ Ever,"I'll say it right now - Civ 4 is BOOORRRRRRING!!!!While the game appears to run smoother on my comptuer than on those of others in this forum, I have to say that even when teh game is up and running it is boring. The AIs take forever to complete their turn. So basically game play is 10% actual play and 90% sitting around and getting bored. Bring a good book!Then there are the many bugs. I say Civ runs smooter on my computer than others with the -er being the operative. It still crashes often when the Wonders movie plays. Also, it takes forever to load - if it loads at all. It also takes forever to close.The game clearly was not adequately Beta-tested. Its pretty bad that Firaxis is basically asking people to pay $50 for the right to Beta-test it. Don't be another sucker! If Firaxis were smart, they'd issue a money back offer beacuse of all the bugs. Otherwise, I do not expect them to survive this bomb."
1,do yourself a favor and pass on this game,"This version of Civilization isn't all that different from the last version, with two exceptions:[1] they added lots of religion[2] they made this version virtually unrunnable.This version is so graphics top-heavy that you simply won't be able to play large maps all the way through without great difficulty. Fortunately a crude patch has been written that makes the game playable, but Firaxis seems to be ignoring the author. Not a good sign when a software company releases software that doesn't work and then refuses to talk with someone who can help.Civ III is by far more enjoyable as the game can flow (no delays from lag and no crashing..). As for this version, wait until they clean up their act AND it's on the bargain rack. It's not worth the price or frustration to buy it any sooner."
4,Updated review of this. Great game now.,"My original review of this was negative. They had major issues with this back when it first came out and it was unplayable. Now that this is all patched up, and with the new expansions, this game is really fun. Civilization III is still my favorite but this is definitely a good Civ game. I completely recommend picking this up even with Civ V out now.Here is my original review...I can't believe they shipped the game in this condition. It constantly freezes or the screen turns blue and informs you of a severe memory leak. I have heard nothing but problems from others and there has been no online help pertaining to this from firaxis or 2kgames. When the patch comes out it may fix this but wait until it does before you buy."
3,Incompatible,I just got off the phone with Take2. They say this game is incompatible with ALL Intel Graphics cards. I can't comment as to its playability as when I try and play it the players appear to be floating in midair and there is no map. In addition do a google search. Even non-intel graphics cards are having SERIOUS issues with running this game. I'd hold off on buying it..
1,Civ 4 Let down!,"This game was hyped from the get go...Look at the first post, well before it was released.I received the game which locked up as it has major problems with ATI video cards.Also, with my new alienware laptop where the inital load movie plays it jumps and pops like pop corn.It's like this game wasnt even play tested. Very disappointed.Don't buy this game until a patch is released!"
2,This game is not ready...,"If you buy this, do not expect it to work, even with current patches. I have played and enjoyed all of the other Civilization games and I can't believe that they would do this to longtime Civ fans. They should have waited to release it when it was actually ready. Don't pay to beta test...buyers beware!!"
1,Buggiest release I've ever seen.,"This is a great game when it works. Unfortunately I can only play for a few minutes at a time before being dropped to the desktop.My specs are far superior than the required and yet it still doesn't work. I've been hung up on by their tech support 'hold queue' 12+ times and have been waiting 2 weeks for a reply to my email tech support request.Don't buy this game until they release a patch (and hopefully it works) or simply don't purchase it at all. Had I not opened the box, it would already have been returned.Video is horrible & sound is as choppy as a turntable playing on a tugboat.This release is a disgrace to the Civilization name.AMD Athlon 642 GB PC3200 DDR256 MB FX5700SBAudigy2 5.1"
1,Disappointing Game Play,"I love Civilization. I've been playing the game since it's first release. I was hoping, however, that the slowness of the engine would be resolved. It hasn't. Molassas in January in the Artic would run faster.In addition, there were issues with my video card. I have a GeForce FX 5700 and experienced the video issues described with ATI cards. I would think that QA at the developers would have resolved these issues before release. Indeed, I have to restart my computer after playing the game. This seems excessive.I cannot recommend this game until these issues are addressed."
1,Yet another hardware victim,"I wish I'd known BEFORE I bought this game that it wouldn't work with any Intel graphics cards. If you have an Intel 82852/82855 GM/GME graphics controller, you get the infamous floating eyeballs and black, unplayable map. Simply flushing $50 down the toilet is quicker and involves a lot less fruitless clicking and tweaking.I've been playing Civ avidly since the first version, had been looking forward to a new Civ for months, and I'm very frustrated. Why on earth set the hardware requirements so high? I've never played any of the Civ series for graphics or sound; it was always the gameplay that kept me playing over and over. So now I can't enjoy that gameplay because of all the whiz-bang graphics nonsense that I don't care much about anyway.I guess I'll break out Colonization yet again and enjoy its chunky pixels and delightful gameplay. Maybe the authors of this lemon should do the same."
1,Never Even Got to Play it,"I am a Sid Meier geek. I love Civ and all previous versions of it. I also play Pirates. I was so excited, as were previous reviewers, when I received this game, I ripped it open in anticipation. It installed fine, no glitches there. but I was never able to play it. I own a nice computer that exceeded the system requirements. I called ""technical support"", what a joke that was. After being disconnected 4 times, I finally got a human who told me to try a fix that had nothing to do with my problem. After 5 hours of applying that fix, the game still would not work. I am returning my copy and it breaks my heart."
4,"Excellent Book But Beware of Titles with ""Introduction""","My old chemistry teacher, Mr. MacDonald, once said, ""Beware of Textbooks with introduction in the title."" He was right. This text was a thoroughly enjoyable read, though sometimes I was over my head. With that said, and I abhore technocrats spouting terminology, it was an excellent text with thorough explanations of risk factor calculations; I bought this book to accompany Mark Tweeddale's ""Managing Risk and Reliability of Process Plants."" This book is a must-have for those involved in reliability, i.e., process engineers, reliability engineers, and safety engineers.If this review was helpful, please add your vote -- Thanks."
1,Buyer Beware!,"The product description provided here from the manufacturer can not be relied upon. When I received the item I discovered there are no front A/V inputs, an essential feature for me. The product description states that front A/V inputs are included. I informed the manufacturer of the inaccuracy via email and got an unintelligible response. Who knows what other listed features are missing? I returned the VCR and am avoiding Samsung from now on."
1,Will never buy Samsung again.,I got this vcr as a gift. It worked fine for maybe two or three movies but then started getting a lot of static in the picture and bad sound quality. I probably called Customer Service about it 5 or 6 times. Each time they gave me different instructions as to how to reset it or clean it to get it to work properly but none of their instructions worked. The only other option was to take it to a repair facility 70 miles away. I decided it wasn't worth it.Roy
4,the mouse that roared,The product arrived in good time in good shape. Haven't seen it in years; it's hillarious.
4,Funny Cold War Satire,"This is not the funniest vehicle for Peter Sellers, but it was the first film to demonstrate his versatility to worldwide audiences. In this film he plays three roles and he does reasonably well in all of them. Basically this film is a gentle tweaking of the post World War II-Cold War politics of the day and as a time capsule this film holds up rather well. An interesting double-bill for this film would be with Dr. Strangelove."
3,Good Satirical Comedy,"Not as great as I remember, but still a good example of British humor with the great Peter Sellars in several parts."
4,Mouse that scored,We all might try this. A small almost non-existent country in the Alps is going bankrupt because the wine they export has been undercut by the big boys. The solution is to declare war on the U. S. & wait for your inevitable defeat. The U. S. will then rebuild the country just as they always rebuild what they destroy in war.Peter Sellers who I don't like much plays three roles in this farcical look at the Duchy of Grand Fenwick. There are good supporting roles & I do enjoy this show. I'm just not sure why I like this. I like the Pink Panther shows but most of the rest of his work I don't. Anyhow few plans work out as first thought & this one is no exception. Over the top zaniness rules as usual for Sellers. 4 Stars.
4,Peter Sellers At His Best,"A great movie on a pretty darn good DVD.Sellers is excellent in his many roles he plays. This cold war comedy really surprised me with its wit and cleverness.Overall, if you enjoyed Sellers in Dr. Strangelove, this film is a must see."
2,Boring -,"This movie may have been funny in 1959, but no longer. The acting is contrived, and it over-relies on Peter Sellers playing three roles. The European duchy of Grand Fenwick comes under economic stress when its sole export, wine, is copied and undersold by an American firm. Prime Minister County Mountjoy (Peter Sellers) proposes that they declare war on the U.S., Grand Duchess Gloriana (Peter Sellers) is reticent until she understands the point is to lose and then receive massive aid, so the plan is approved and Tully Bascombe (Peter Sellers again) is placed in charge of the attack. They arrive in New York (conducting a bomb drill), capture its leading scientist, his daughter, and newest bomb, and return to Grand Fenwick. Love brings the scientist's daughter and Tully to wed, the Americans surrender - giving up the wine that undermined Grand Fenwick, as well as $1 billion in aid, and everyone lives happily ever after. The bomb turns out to be a dud, just like the film."
5,A Great Movie,This movie is really funny and fast-moving. It is great family entertainment. Peter Sellers is at his best.
3,"An okay movie, but it is...","I first saw this movie many years ago from a friend of mine who recommended it. I thought it was very funny about the premise, where the US always loves to rebuild countries that it defeats in wars. So this country of Fenwick decides to declare war on the US and lose so they can get money, as that their requests seemed to fall on deaf earsin Washington.Anyway...There really isn't any war in the movie, nor any real violence in it. Peter Sellers does a great job playing 3 different roles too. William Hartnell (the first Doctor of Doctor Who) also is in the movie, as a supporting actor to one of Peter Seller's many roles.Could have been better, but I still love it. I own the DVD and liked it."
2,Disappointing,"To save its failed economy, the Duchy of Grand Fenwick declares war on the United States with the intention of losing and receiving millions of dollars in aid. Unfortunately, Grand Fenwick's invasion force accidentally wins by seizing control of the experimental Q-bomb.The premise of this cold war farce is funnier than its execution. Jack Arnold's direction is uninspired and the whole enterprise creaks along rather mechanically. Peter Sellars appears in three different roles, but he seems to be holding back. Although I found the film clever at times, I did not find one genuine laugh."
4,The Lucky Mouse,"A humerous movie in which a tiny country in Europe wants to go to war with America and lose, so they can collect money to rebuild their shattered economy after their primary export of wine is replaced by a fake duplicate. They invade New York, but there is no one around due to a drill, so they seize the Q bomb and win the war."
3,Three Stars is Stretching It,"I'm a huge Peter Sellers fan. So I started buying just about anything he was ever in just so that I could get another taste of his genius, but this film is not much. It is interesting to see footage of Sellers pulling off multiple roles in the same film - something that he would do throughout his career, and most successfully in Dr. Strangelove - but these roles and characters are thin because the movie's premise is thin. Some light moments, but too few. It all goes to reinforce the enigma that is Sellers, because we got to enjoy so little of him before he died."
4,True lassics never go out of style.,"This classic movie is as relavent today as when it was made, The best thing a country can do for it's economy is still to loose a war with the U.S. Just look at Korea, Japan, Germany, and Viet Nam."
4,Cute but a little large,"Bought this for my son that is nearly 3 and it is wayyyyy too big for his hand. He is not abnormally small for his age, either. I think its a well made item and he likes playing with the ball for now. Maybe by next Christmas it will fit him better."
5,Great product,This was a gift for my 3 year old nephew..this is a good first glove and ball setIt is colorful but the real deal
3,Some rare songs that provide laughs,"I got this CD in the budget bin at Barnes & Noble. I agree that the best track is Allan Sherman's parody of The 12 Days of Christmas. Boris Pickett's ""Monster's Holiday"" is a good song you usually don't hear, his Halloween standard ""Monster Mash"" gets far more airplay on the radio. Ray Stevens' ""Santa Claus is Watching You"" (he's everywhere), Barry Gordon's ""Nuttin' For Christmas"" and Satchmo's ""Zat You Santa Claus"" round out the best cuts on this CD. The rest of the selections are okay, if not unusual. The Transylvania and the McKensie tracks are an acquired taste. The Martin Mull and Mike Nichols/Elaine May tracks are both narratives intended to amuse. They're ""interesting"" to say the least.Bottom line, this CD is less than 30 minutes, but it can be gotten for less than $10, so if you want a couple of laughs and some songs you probably don't have, get this CD if you can find it."
1,terrible waste of time,"It's not that there isn't good information in this book, it just that you'll waste alot of your (presumably valuable) time getting it! You'll find yourself doing a lot of skimming just to find the crucial points of a paragraph or chapter.Buy UML Distilled by Martin Fowler instead. Excellent book."
2,Good for absolute beginners A LOT OF FLUFF,"I got this book thinking it offered a practical but detailed approach for running longer distances. While it offers some decent insights it is a more of a 'you can do it', 'boost you up' book then a real nuts and bolts workout regimen. I am disappointed that their training plans are only a minor part of the book, mostly relegated to the back in the form of tables with very little variety or explanation. Likewise, they promise to explain certain things later in the book but never do. Get rid of most of the life affirming stories and put more substance in there. I am a pretty fit person and have a medical background and I can also add that some of their medical/injury stuff is a little outdated. If you have never run before then this is a good book. More experienced athletes will be disappointed."
5,i love the penguin!,This book is so sweet and uplifting. I am a beginning runner and I just loved this book. It helped me get the motivation I needed to keep on my training. I am going to buy the rest of his books. I can't get enough!
4,Ultimate Bingham,"Bingham always has a great perspective inside each edition of Runner's World. 'Marathoning for Mortals' keeps the same tone while connecting the dots of his 'high five' mantra into a training regiment.You'll get high praise from Bingham while ""Coach Jenny"" brings it back to the training. They cover everything for the beginner as well as the the runner who is looking to take on his/her third/fourth marathon.It takes you month by month through the training, anticipating every heartbreak and muscle ache. If you're thinking about marathoning, then start here, then move onto Galloway or Higdon."
4,Great Information for a First Timer,"This book contains a lot of great information for first time marathon/half-marathon runners. The book is well organized and written in a clear and readable style. In addition to the 8 customized training programs and accompanying advice, there are also special sections on deciding which race to run and when, injury prevention, nutrition, gear, race day strategy, and recovery.This is the best such book I have read on the topic."
4,Funny and easily readable!,"The Penguin makes all of us feel we, too, can! Already planning for my half marathon. Great tips and humorous writing. The only commentary is the book is somewhat repetitive and could be trimmed down to a more concise version."
3,BBros.,"After a long time of waiting of the idea, they finally did a live performance and put it on DVD. The stage set up was OK and the camera angles were good, but...They took out way too much percussion. I was disappointed when I found no percussion at all in songs like Memorize when it truly needed it. I've seen them perform live many times and after doing so, I think the DVD could have been better. They were a great band to see in person and I enjoyed all of their concerts!"
5,A gem in an ocean of books on Columbus,There are many books on Columbus but none surpass the quality of the writing and the way the authors lay out the history of the great discovery including what led Columbus to his decision to sail west into an unknown sea. His dealings with Spain's royalty and his later misfortunes are put in context with the times he lived in. A real pleasure to read.
1,alarmist from the left field,One of the worst purely anecdotal unscientific book. Too many references are misquoted or taken out of context. A wanna be expert preying on the vulnerability of the simpletons. He would have us all bathing in a tub of oregano oil smelling like a spagetti sauce.
3,the very best of meatloaf,"I liked some of the songs on this CD but there were a few I did not like. The ones I didn't like were songs I had not heard before. I don't think I would purhcase the CD again, I would look at different ones."
3,Meat Loaf,"I love Meat Loaf, but I was disappointed in this item because the music is so loud that you can't hear the words."
5,Meatloaf is one of the best Music Lords,"I don't think I've been more drawn in by music since ever! Any chance I find a Meatloaf song. It's immediately on my MP3 Player. If I don't got the cord to get the song I'll e-mail it to myself so I can sync it later. That's just Meatloaf. The kind of music you've got to have.I've always loved Meatloaf ever since I was what? Five? Four? Maybe when I was just being born. His music is just fantastic. I love numerous of his songs. My top favorites are ""Paradise By the Dashboard Light"", ""Dead Ringer for Love"", ""I Would Do Anything for Love(But I Won't Do That"", and who could forget ""Hot Patootie-Bless My Soul/What Ever Happened to Saturday Night?""?Speak bad of him all you want but Meatloaf has this thing that just lures you closer to listen. Whether you bop to the music, or just listen intentively. Every song tells a story. And Meatloaf does just that."
3,50/50,"I will give Meat Loaf this: He has heart. Talent? that's another story. I hate to anger all of you fans out there, but this guy should've stayed in the 70's where he belonged. The reason I give this album 3 stars instead of 1 is for the mere reason that Jim Steinman is a relatively talented man; and, well, Andrew Lloyd Webber is an outright genious. The music is wonderful, the lyrics for the most part are decent, but sorry meat, you're voice has got to be one of the most annoying ones on the planet."
