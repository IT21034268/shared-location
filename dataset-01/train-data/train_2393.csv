3,Class,I got this book to go along with videos I watched on YouTube for Spanish. It helped a little and is better than other books out there. But you could save money by just watching the video with a friend and talking about it.
5,Another Gold by Maggie,The book was once agian very good....I hated 'fina by the end of Twilight hunger but after this book i understood her and apricated her alot more than i did in twilight hunger now that I've learned her past and story its easy to get why she is so cold and what not....the ending wasn't as good as Twilight hunger and kinda left me hanging which was rather dissapointing....and I would've liked to know what happened to Dante and Morgan (Although if you read her other books there are bits and peices of them in there) its a very good book though....Maggie once agian hit gold...
1,Very disappointed!!!,I ordered this costume for my daughter in a size large. I was sent an extra small. She cried all night because that was all she wanted to be. I ended up having to buy a last minute costume. Threre was only one thing left in her size. Not happy.
3,Everything not included,"The costume is great, but it didn't come with a tail. Nothing in the description said it wouldn't come with the tail. Other than that it's okay."
3,Yahtzee Score Sheets.,"You get just one pad of score sheets (80) so it's kind of pricey to me, but cheaper in the long run than printing your own considering the price of the ink these days not to mention the paper. I would try and find the pads at a local store next time and save a little money. I am not apposed to this item but can't really recommend it either."
5,"Great fun, good for teaching math skills to young ones",We play this old game we grew up with often and our grandkids enjoy it as much as we do. It is a great way for teaching young ones how to add and multiply.
3,Desire Under the Elms,"Its the only play i read in the book. It was an interesting read. The dialect is sometimes hard to understand, only a few words though.The play is fast moving and interesting. The scandalous Eben-???(dont want to ruin it for you) relationship is unexpected and dramatic. Perhaps too dramatic, in a rome and juliet complex."
4,mourning becomes elektra,"Oneill, death death death, this is rereleased in vintage 1958,mourning becomes electra , strange interlude, required readingfor all playwrights of our era."
2,The Drawn Cat,"If you like line drawings of cats, this book is for you. The artwork is from the other side of Pacific, done in watercolors. Some of the works look like cats; others are artistic representations, being cat-like. The text is of Chinese proverbs and philosophers."
4,a great introduction to chimerunga music,"this album is nearly ideal for those interested in trying to understand the power and passion of chimerunga music. while it may seem to leack some of the urgency of mapfumo's work in the 1970s, his biting social criticisms and observations of daily life in zimbabwe provide an excellent window into comtemporary zimbabwean society. mapfumo truly is the voice of modern-day zimbabwe, and this recording only serves to further cement that position. while nothing can beat seeing him live, playing in some shebeen in the high-density suburbs of harare, this album comes close."
4,A fun trip down memory lane,"Lots of vintage pics in b&w; and color. As well as recollections of the past.Lots of fun. Plenty here. And if you can get it for a good price ( I got mine here used on Amazon) , even better!I recommend it."
5,For the kid in all of us!,"Hal Lifson's 1966! caught my attention because I was born in 1966. Flipping through this wildly eye-catching book made me remember things I loved about my own childhood during (mostly) the '70s. The Brady Bunch, Kaboom! cereal, Lik-m-Aid candy, my Flatsy dolls, and discovering Dr. Pepper were all great as a kid. But as an adult, Lifson convinces that the freshness and surreal creativity of '66 pop culture was indeed ""the coolest!"" How FUN was practicing the Bewitched nose-twitch, wondering if I could turn my bedroom into Jeannie's bottle boudoir, Nancy Sinatra's boots 'n miniskirt image, the Country Squire wagon with the wood panels (my parents' first car), etc., etc? If you're ready for a break from today's world of 9/11, Eminem, and Fat Bastard-type bathroom humor, Lifson is ready to take you on a very charming trip down memory lane."
2,Beware a flawed design and a weak warranty,This product is not designed or built to the usually high Sony standards. The LCD screen WILL break under normal use and Sony will not honor the warranty if the screen fails. My screen failed after six months and I returned the computer to Sony for repairs. Sony charged me over $700 and refused to return the 'physically damaged screen' as I requested so that the 'intentional damage' that I 'caused' could be verified. To confirm that this is a design flaw Sony included with the repaired computer NEW instructions as to how to prevent damaging the screen noting that 'the LCD screen may be sensitive to pressure or added stress'. This product is a sad commentary on Sony's design standards and on its unwillingness to stand behind its warranty.
3,Beware about available software,"The size and weight are perfect, and the keyboard is not difficult to use, but I was surprised that I paid over $2000 for a computer that only include Microsoft Works. I saw that installed software included Windows XP Professional Edition, and didn't realize that this isn't Office software of any kind--if you want the Office suite that is on the computer, you must purchase it separately (after a 60 day trial, if desired). I still don't understand what's included in XP Professional, but it's NOT Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Publisher, all software that I need. I am very disappointed with this product for that reason. I'll probably not buy from Sony again."
5,The McClurkins are Heaven sent,"Great Cd from top to bottom, if Elder Donnie is a part of it you know its gonna be good and annointed by Christ. Great job Family."
4,Flamin' Groovies - always underrated,"The Flamin' Groovies are the missing link between UK pub rock and UK punk/wave. Somewhat underrated when they were active (think mid- to late 1970s), their true value only becomes apparent after a gap of more than 20 years (at least that happened in my case:-) - anyway, ""Shake Some Action"" is a classical teenager hymn and the best song to sample if you want to get into the band's material. Not everything they put out is great, but this is a decent album, and it's available at a decent price. Check this out!"
1,Bootleg,"Yet another bootleg of the Flamin' Groovies where the label makes the money and the artists see none of it (think AIM Records, bigtime mafioso bootleggers from Australia, from which the material on this disc is culled). If you want a proper introduction to this incredible band, but a copy of Groovies Greatest Grooves (which does pay royalties to Cyril Jordan) or Slow Death (on the Norton label, likewise paying the artist). Don't waste your money on this shoddy product from hucksters."
3,Absolutely Mediocre,"The Groovies, in spite of their legendary reputation and integrity, are nothing all that special, they are basically just a garage band that never went anywhere. If this really is their absolute best, it's easy to see why."
2,Not quite what I thought,I was disappointed with what the book offered. A very basic read with common sense stuff we already know. Didn't help me on my path to love after 50....
1,Disappointing rip-off,Don't buy this unless you prefer cheesy synthesizer versions of Morricone's themes instead of the real thing. Blech.
4,"Gifts of the Spirit, explained in basic english, no theology","very easy to understand, this book kept calling me back, to completion. It answered so many questions brought up by ministers and the Bible. Mr. Wigglesworth, a great man of faith, 8th grade education, but used mightily of the Lord."
4,Transformative,"There are very few books that I've read in a single sitting. This is one of those few. As someone who has an interest in academic theology and Biblical studies, it seems strange that I would count a book like this among my favorites, but Smith Wigglesworth on Spiritual Gifts changed my life for the better. Wigglesworth was an extremist by most people's (even Christians') standards, yet he was amazingly balanced in his view on the gifts of the Spirit. His reverence for God and desire for the body of Christ's edification is evident on every page of this book. I highly recommend this to zealous Charismatics and skeptical non-Charismatics alike. What it lacks in scholarship it more than makes up for in spirit."
5,This has been one of the most exiciting books I have read,"The auther held my imagination, and attention, form start to finish. The detailed charactors made the book one of my favorites"
5,Love the Kodak Camera P712.7 Digital!,"This camera is a dream, the battery lasted all Christmas eve & day, and then some! The images are clear, focused, and the delayed flash is great. Be sure to take off the lens cap before pushing start button, and reviewing photos is so easy! I recommend this camera for all parents who are not pro photographers."
3,NOISE,"I could hear a noise coming from the camera -- unlike any of my previous Kodak EasyShare digital cameras and could also feel the gears grinding in my hands.The noise was much louder when coming through crystal clear with each zoom in or out of the lens.So I called Kodak's Product Support to find out. Kodak's Customer Service Associate put me on hold, and when he came back on line, told me that he and his supervisor shot videos with zoom on three P712 digital cameras, checking the results on their computer, with NO sound problems.He said I had a defective camera and suggested to send to the Kodak to repair it. So I did it, they send the camera to your workshop and is supposed to be repair but, unfortunately, the problem continued.I want to know is this normal or what wrong"
4,Large hands & Big Fingers,"I bought this camera last October 2006 for myself, after doing a lot of online and in store comparison shopping. Since I have large hands & fingers I need to try the cameras in person. Due to all the latest Digital cameras becoming so compact, this was very important as well as all the other reviews I was reading.Now after shooting over 500 pictures, from indoor low light to outdoors, I can say that I am satisfied with the placement of most to the control buttons. I found by adding a small tripod type of grip, I am able to get the degree of pictures that I was expecting from this great camera, overcoming my large hands & fingers."
4,Kodak Easyshare P712,"Very satisfied with this product. I have owned several Kodak cameras and Kodak consistently delivers quality and features with its products. The only negative thing I have to say concerns the easyshare software. For the most part it works well but the built in update feature seems to conflict with Microsoft Windows. I have tried installing it on several machines with different Windows operating systems with the same result. Also, I do not like the way that the program takes control of every picture (jpeg, tiff or gif) file on your machine and forces it to be a Kodak image and open it primarily in the Easyshare software. There are ways around this issue of the way it takes control and opens picture files, but it is annoying to have to deal with."
5,Great!,"Great little camera, and really wish that they still made them like this. That's why I had to snatch this one up when I saw it. We needed something small but with a hot shoe for an external flash and this one fit the bill. Easy to use and takes wonderful pictures...thanks."
4,Great camera for the price,"This is my third Kodak camera. I love the zoom and image stabilization on this one. Kodak cameras are so easy to use! The only thing I am a little dissapointed in is the shutter response time when the camera is on the highest quality setting and using flash. It's still hard to get those instant action shots. However, it is better than the cameras I have had in the past and the picture quality is fabulous!"
5,Love this camera,"I have only had my Easyshare P712 since Christmas, but I took some great pictures with it. I owned a previous Easyshare so had no trouble figuring it out. The image stabilization was worth spending a few extra dollars for. The 12x zoom is awesome. I got wonderful clear shots from some pretty fair distances while the grandkids were sledding. It has a very short recovery between flash pictures, much better than my previous DX6490. All in all I am a satisfied customer."
4,Excellent camera for low light flash photography,"The camera is capable of focusing under very low light. The low light focusing ability of this camera is unmatched, even compared with camera that has focus illumination.However, while shooting video, the focus is slow to catch up with the zoom, especially when zoomed in completely. Sometimes, the focus may never lock, if it is zoomed in completely, very quickly. To get it to focus, zoom back slightly, and the camera will focus. Once it is focused, max zoom in slowly, and the camera will stay focused.The camera takes very good still and video, and has a very smooth zoom."
5,Wait! Second edition just Finished! Amazon will have it within the month!,"This was posted on my favorite site ""MexConnect"", which Teresa is a contributing columnist for.""Miss T's new updated book, MEXICO'S LAKE CHAPALA & AJIJIC (The Insider's Guide) is finally out. It is twice a big as the previous edition (417 pages) and includes references to just about everything and everyplace from Guadalajara to Jocotepec.It won't be available from Amazon for a week or two, but there are a few advance copies for sale at Galería de Maestros de Arte on 16th de Septiembre (in the Lake Chapala area of Mexico).It really is a great reference book!! ""I love the first edition and have been eagerly waiting for this 2nd edition!!!!"
5,A must have for anyone remotely interested in Ajijic / Lake Chapala,"I know this book as B & B operator in Ajijic with Villa del Angel. I have this book myself, and find it INVALUABLE to living in this area. I do not know what we would do without it. I recommend it to all my guests staying here. It is a must read must have for Ajijic / lake Chapala. If for some reason they cannot find it locally, as is the case due to it's popularity. I send them here to Amazon. If you are a resident of the area, or thinking of moving here. Then by all means, buy this book."
5,"Review of "" the insiders Guide""","An excelent book Best of its type on that area...Pity its not still available as ""used"" ( i.e. lower cost !!)."
5,Great Guide for Lake Chapala,"This book gives you a very detailed guide to what's happening in Lake Chapala, Mexico and all the resources you'll need to live there or visit. Lots of phone numbers and addresses, recommendations to consider, maps, photos, easy to follow narrative. A superb handbook for anyone thinking about moving tho this little piece of paradise."
5,This book is a must have...,"if you are living in or planing on visiting the Lake Chapala area. We recently moved to Lakeside, and the pages are dog-eared already. Sometimes I almost feel like Ms. Kendrick is reading my mind. I think, ""I wonder where to get..."" or ""Is there a place nearby to..."" and it is in the book. It is an impressive combination of Guide Book for what to see and do, and Directory to were to find what."
2,Mexico Lake Chapala and Ajijic the Insiders Guide,The majority of the information in this guide is readily available on the web. I was hoping to learn something new. The photographs are small and many out of focus. Not very colorful and nothing new. If you are savy on the net you can get 90% of this information for free and word for word much of the text is available on Mexico Connect.
2,Old and out of date,"This guide needs to be updated and it's not so much for tourists, more for people living or planning to move here. A shame, because there are no other guides."
5,"Great Resource - Ajijic, Mexico","If you are thinking of traveling to or living in Chapala, Jalisco, Mexico. This is a wonderful resource. There is an updated version."
5,Tremendous,"As an introduction to Beethoven's late sonatas, this 2 cd set can't be beat, especially at the price.While I prefer a more violent Hammerklavier, Brendel's, along with No.s 27 and 28, is far more than merely adequate. The deeply introspective nature of all of these pieces make numerous interpretations well worthwhile anyway.But what really stands out in this set is the Arietta of opus 111. It seems to me that maybe Brendel was just playing the Maestoso to get to the soul of the work, but it's likely that's just my own overly eager anticipation as the listener! His Arietta is the most exquisite I've heard; the pain and joy and revelation are life-changingly astounding.Buy it as an introduction, treasure it for No. 32."
3,You could do worse,"There isn't much to complain about in this recording, nor is there much to rave about. Brendel's playing seems a little pedantic to me, especially in the second movement of Op. 111, but it isn't abysmal, either. This CD set is a good find for the price, but Brendel himself might agree that this is not his best playing: he re-recorded the Beethoven sonatas in the 90s, giving performances that are generally more fluid and imaginative than the ones here."
3,Chopin,"I didn't like this version of the Barcarolle as much as the original by ""Offenbach"". I tried to locate a CD by the original Artist (Offenbach) but couldn't fine a CD available with the ""Barcarolle"" on it."
4,Book,"I thought this was a card deck and book set, but it is just the book(my fault for not reading the description)Now I just need to get the deck to go with it! I am happy about this book."
1,my second deck,"I just received this deck in the mail today. I bought it to replace my old deck - the exact same deck. The colors are off and the images are blurry compared to my old/current deck, which has crisp clean colors and isn't blurry. Sorely disappointed."
4,a must for dragon lovers,"This deck has wonderful artwork, vibrant and full of detail. If one is a dragon lover, then buying this deck is a logical choice. However, if one is merely looking for a deck, I would recommend this one also. The booklet explains meanings well and offers a springboard for the reader to form their own interpretations. My complaint is that many of the minor arcana cards are not very original and appear to be taken directly from the Rider-Waite deck without many modifications. A good buy nonetheless."
4,beautiful tarot,"a good product, the graphic is very beautiful, everything arrived on time and place without problemsthrough Amazon.com"
3,interesting and workable.,"I found the deck to be vibrant and rich in the diagram department. The cards in the minor arcana follow a logical sequence of a dragon's journey, aiding the ability to work the cards and remember key meanings. I found the book to be useful in explaining the meanings of the diagrams but the actual divinatory meanings were incredibly basic (consisting of only a couple of words). This is bad for anyone new to the tarot but not esentially a bad thing for those experienced. The cards themsleves tend to be on the small side, more like playing cards and could have been sized just a little bigger. In all the deck is beautiful but the book is best in experienced hands as new tarotists would be extremely dissapointed in the lack of detail in the meanings of the cards."
4,Dragon Tarot by Peter Pracownik,"The dragon tarot cards have nice artwork on them, but they are not the easiest cards to read. Definitely not a good choice for a beginner, but a nice deck if you are a collector. For readings I suggest the following cards: Robin Wood, Hanson-Roberts, or Barbara Walker."
3,Not for beginners,This is a beautiful tarot deck but not for beginners. They are not as existential as most other tarot decks. The writing is also difficult to read and the definitions provided in the little book are much simpler but too broad. You really have to be a good B.S.er to use these.
2,Not all I'd hoped,"Peter Pracownick has produced some beautiful dragon pictures over the years. Unfortunately, this deck feels rushed and shallow. There is minimal symbolism in the minor arcana and even some of the major arcana seem to be thrown together rather than carefully constructed.The cards themselves are thin and not well finished.It would have been helpful to have seen more images of the cards prior to purchasing the deck and also to have a look at the booklet that came with the deck.All in all, a disappointing deck for me."
5,Great Deck,"This was my first deck, and I love it! The illustrations are great and easy to understand. The Celtic cross spread it uses in the instruction booklet is too advanced for beginners, or was for me. The deck is wonderful. It's small and easy to handle, great for readings! I use it every reading!"
5,Awesome Graphics and Easy to Understand,"The Dragon Tarot has awesome graphics. My son loves dragons, and I bought this as his first Tarot deck.The Minor Arcana has the elements symbol on the cards...for Swords..Air, Wands...Fire, Pentacles...Earth, Cups...Water. The Dragons are the same type for the Swords, etc. The Major Arcana has the Zodiac and Planet symbols on it. The Wheel of Fortune has a Lion on one side, a Dragon on the other, and the Wheel with Zodiac Symbols...very cool.I would like the deck for myself! LOL He can really tune into this deck, it's not difficult to understand."
4,"Very Bold, But full?","When I ordered this product, I knew I was buying a great brand of oil based pens. When I got the pens I Shook them, and wrote with them and painted very nice and bold. BUT... I Bought these same pens a long time ago, and I knew i was running out of paint so I ordered more. I shook the new ones, and compared it to my old ones, and it seems as if my old ones have more paint in it than the the new ones! the new ones are lighter, and dont sound as loud as the old ones. Just a little disapointed with the capacity of paint in the cartridge... But despite that, These pens are fantastic!"
4,Funniest Cookbook I've ever read,"I received this book as a birthday gift because of my love of cooking. The begining of this book is the funniest thing I've ever read in my life. Although pictures would have been nice, I enjoyed the many chapters and funny little comments from the Chef/Author throughout the book. This cookbook is a must for the ""Newlywed"" couple. Great book for men too."
4,A Charming Vampire Tale!,"Tom Poston and Elizabeth Montgomery take refuge in an old dark house on a rainy night and get more they bargained for when confronted with a family of extreme eccentrics. The house, by the way, is the same one used for Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, which lends the episode a familiar air. Did I mention that it's a comedy? Well, it is, and it's filled with delightful twists and turns. Poston and Montgomery make a nice couple, and maybe became enamored of the supernatural as a result of this show. In the next couple of years Poston would go on to star in a couple of comedy-thriller films for William Castle, while Miss Montgomery would find herself turned into a witch, albeit a benign one, on the TV comedy Bewitched. Perhaps it all started with Masquerade, which is that rarity, an amiable horror spoof, suitable for children, with no blood or gore to speak of and plenty of thrills in the bargain."
5,excellent read,"If you havent yet read Robert Goddard, you are in for a real treat. He is widely read in the UK, but much less so in this country. INTO THE BLUE is a wonderful example of his mastery of the english language and of good story-telling."
4,Good Read,"The main character, Harry Barnett, initially comes off as a loser but as the story progresses he becomes more commendable. This is an interesting mystery with lots of twists and turns. It takes you to many interesting places over a lifetime of Harry.The Harry Barnett series was recommended to me by a friend and I am glad I followed through."
5,Hooked,"This author was recommended to me by a fan. I searched Amazon for Robbert Goddard books and purchased 'Into the Blue' because it was quite cheap in Kindle format. I did wonder if it was the right book to start on as it was so cheap I thought maybe the book wasn't as good as his others.I was hooked from the first chapter.I love the way he writes, used real settings and how the mystery was not predictable but built through out the story.Needless to say I will be purchasing all his books that become available on Kindle."
5,Up To Date Reviews of Of Robert Goddard Books,"I have already written a review for you for Into The Blue by Robert Goddard. I am disappointed that all of the previous reviews for this book are so ""old"" ( 1995 etc.). Why is this so? Am I the only Amazon.com customer who ever reads this wonderful author? I don't think so.Kindly let us see some current only reviews. In this modern world it irritates me to be only able to read pieces that are years old."
1,Boring and clumsy,"Maybe I don't get British pulp fiction pacing. Maybe I'm not a fan of missing person mysteries. Maybe everyone else is crazy. :). Whatever it was, this is the first book I've started and quit before finishing in a long,long time. The book feels dated as well as just simply boring. Obviously I'm in the minority with this opinion, but if you weren't a fan or are too young to remember 'Murder She Wrote"", you will not enjoy this book."
2,Filma SIN SONIDO !!!!!!,"Lumix DMC-LZ6S 7.2MP Digital Camera with 6x Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver) . Me equivoque al comprar una camara tan buena, pero que filma sin sonido, lo que la vuelve incompleta."
3,Nice out doors,I liked this camera but indoor pictures are very blurry.i not so goodmaybe 1 good out of 10but out side its soooo nicenight shots very badso i end up selling it.
4,Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ6S 7.2MP Digital Camera with 6x Image Stabilized Zoom (Silver),Camera does everything it is said to do. Price was good and mailing was prompt.
5,Lumix DMC-LZ6S Excellent Camera,"Bought this camera a month ago and used on a trip. Already had over 1000 shots on it. Love its rich features - flexible. Excellent picture quality. Its image stablizer seems to be effective. I also have a Lumix 5Mp camera which is also excellent. I think that there are two limitations on the Lumix cameras people need to know before buying. (1) It does not have a ""view-window"" (only LCD screen). It is impossible to see the screen in sunlight when you don't have a hat or something to shield the reflection; (2) If you plan to use rechargable NiHM batteries, buy only quality rechargable with 2500ma or better. It won't tolerate less quality rechargables."
3,Cubbyhouse or Hellion: The Devil's Playhouse you pick!,"First I have to say I bought this at the low price of $.89 at a Hollywood Video close out & was skeptical to watch just because I'd never heard of the film, but ever a horrible film could be worth watching for 89 cents. I am extremely pleased that I was able to purchase such a great film for such a bargain to my surprise. I won't go into what the story was about because there is another review with such. I will say this though, if you are a fan of The Evil Dead films, Poltergeist, The Gate and/or any witchcraft type film from the 80's & maybe the 90's, this film is for you. It was fun to watch, the story was solid, and the production & acting was a pleasure to enjoy. My compliments to the director, well done, and I'd like to see more Ausie horror if they are anything like this!!On a side note, I like the Cubbyhouse cover better than the Hellion cover, I found it more fitting to the story."
5,Ultimately Supreme!,"If you think ""City of the Dead"" knocked some pure steel out of your Death metal-infested head, then listening to this solid CD will do so with even more firepower. All the basic elements of death are being put the ultimate limits...there's no stopping Diabolic to climb in the Death scene!"
5,deathmetal massacre at it's best!,diabolic is one of the best deathmetal bands i have ever heard! the riffs and the growl low vocals will blow you a way! also great double bass druming and bass playing!
4,This is some blistering s**t!,"These guys can play! Wow. I was not impressed by the stuff I heard from their previous releases, but when I heard this in April 99, I was blwn away. Definitely some of the more technical stuff to come out recently,though the technicality does not affect the brutal aspects. Really cool stuff. My Dream Tour: Vital Remains, God Dethroned, Diabolic, Sadistic Intent (I can dream, right?)."
3,Do you really have this much time?,"While the concept APPEARS possible, I found myself asking ""Do you really have this much time?"" As a teacher, it's summer vacation, and I was still asking myself if I could stop and check my feelings 10 times a day; lie in bed for an extra 1/2 hour each morning; go to bed at 9:00 every night. The six mini-meals and mental check-in were fine, but I have a feeling the program wouldn't work without the rest of the steps."
5,Unique and satisfying,"It's remarkable that two previous reviewers, both fans of Arrau, rated this compilation as ""best"" and ""worst"" performances of the Brahms concertos. I believe it speaks to the uniqueness of Arrau's approach. These recordings increased my already significant respect for Arrau.Arrau takes some liberties in these concertos, particularly with rubato, but I find his liberties highlight the dramatic tension of these works. I prefer Arrau/ Haitink's Brahms 2nd to Richter/ Leinsdorf and Fleisher/ Szell, though I find a special beauty in the account by Gilels/ Jochum that commends it equally. The Arrau/ Haitink version of the first concerto is probably still my favorite.When I want to hear a fresh approach to Brahms' concertos, I listen to the Arrau performance. In this way, it has become an important recording in my collection."
2,False advertising of track times,"I purchase this CD under the impression that it is lengthy recording based on the track times listed by Amazon. When I received the CD and looked at the booklet, I found the listed track times to be much shorter. Loading the CD confirmed the details of the booklet. Amazon should be ashamed for misrepresenting the product. The following is the correct track time of the CD:CD 1----1. Piano Concerto No.1: Maestoso - Poco più moderato: 24:032. Piano Concerto No.1: Adagio: 15:413. Piano Concerto No.1: Rondo (Allegro non troppo): 12:494. Variations on a Theme by Haydn: 19:14CD 2----1. Piano Concerto No.2: Allegro non troppo: 19:102. Piano Concerto No.2: Allegro appassionato: 9:153. Piano Concerto No.2: Andante - Più adagio: 12:004. Piano Concerto No.2: Allegretto grazioso - Un poco più presto: 9:555. Tragic Overture: 13:326. Academic Festival Overture: 10:19"
5,"Has a ""mixed emotions"" type of vibe.","At first, I had to give this one a chance to grow on me. The beginning of the title track immediately sets the feeling for the album. The rest just smoothly follows along with more of a jazzy feel to it. The most jumping song on here is ""Sex Thang"". I dug Abraham Laboriel's rapid, but groovin' bass lines on that track. This one actually has the elements from all of his styles (and he has many). Check it out for yourself."
1,Save your money,"Save your money and buy something better. The table is flat. The insert has too much camber plus you have to drill it as others have mentioned (not a big deal). The big problem is that the fence was about 1/8 to 1/16"" out of square over its hieght. I called mlcs they told me to shim it with tape. I told them the ad says this thing is made with a tolorance of 0.01"". They said thats a typo should be 0.01"" PER INCH. I told them that 1/16"" is still twice that lame tolorance and they said they would not send a replacement."
2,just fair,"Agree with the review about assembly. Even though it only took 30 minutes to figure it out, it could have been done in 10-15 minutes with a simple assembly sheet. Quality is just so-so. i teach woodshop at a high school, and this was the first time I bought a piece of equipment that is not industrial grade. I purchased this with their 200 dollar cabinet and can't say it is junk, but it simply isn't as good a quality as my small home use bosch table is. It is bigger, which makes it easier for my students to work with, but if it's a home shop tool you're looking for, I would recommend the bosch or similar table."
5,Piano + more,This CD gave me an appreciation of his music with an orchestra because I am much more used to performers who play Chopin's piano music with no musical backup. This worthwhile CD is as pretty as the design on its cover.
2,Lacking a button to activate / deactivate its built-in flash,"Since it lacks a button to activate or deactivate its built-in flash, it flashes even you're taking pictures in bright sunny conditions."
3,Okay as long as you know that everything is controled byhand,This is a pretty good little camera but do keep in mind you have to do almost everything by hand. It has a quick flash and is very inexpensive. Just remember that you have to wind it between pictures and to put the film in and out.
1,Horrible Camera,"I received this camera as a present, probably becuase of its inexpensive price. From the very beginning I had problems with it. It is difficult to load, and you can not turn the flash on or off. Half the time it doesn't rewind, and other times it does. The film compartment opens by itself, ruining all of my pictures. I have wasted FOUR WHOLE rolls of used film one way or the other. Today, I am buying a new one becuase I just threw this one against my wall.Hope this helps and happy shoping!"
5,nice shoe,"Very comfortable shoe, exactly what I needed for my trip to Costa Rica and all the outdoor adventures. Love the quick drying action and I wouldn't hesitate to use these for other activities. I have wide feet but these shoes have enough give so I felt no discomfort during the break-in period. Nicely made and excellent quality!"
2,Had to return,It looks great and looks well made. I had to return it as the arch didn't work well with my foot. I have other Columbia shoes that I love.
2,Fit of Columbia Hybrid Water Shoe not right,Purchased this shoe in my size as possible alternative to Keen Arroyo II which I had worn out.But fit was not nearly as good as the Keens. Returned the Columbias and bought another pair of the Keens. Moral: buy what you know works.
4,Would be 5 star but...,"Great shoes for wet wading or just hanging in the river. However, even though they are self bailing, they are not safe for swimming. I've had these for about 2 yrs and used thim many times. Last weekend my kayak got swamped in a waterfall and while trying to swim out, these shoes just about made me a permanent fixture of the river. So don't use them for swimming, they do not allow you to kick well to swim and the added weight of them after being completely submerged is a killer...literally"
3,"Enjoyable, but short lived...","There aren't as many questions as I would like there to be. After ""playing"" this game for a short while, my son and I soon realized we were out of questions! Bummer. Otherwise fun though."
1,Junk DVD,"Received the DVD ""Padre Pio: Between Heaven and Earth"" from Amazon just yesterday. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts on two different DVD players, I am unable to play the English language version. Since I do not understand Italian, the DVD is useless to me. Watch out for a defective DVD. You do not want to waste your time and money like I have."
5,Very Good,"Excelent product. I recomend it. Good history and actors. Came in time. Else, I recomend to visit the actually city."
1,very boring movie,"Wow! Poor St. Padre Pio.....this was a very boring movie. My devout 22 year old daughter and I just couldn't get through it....don't bother with this one. Watch or buy Padre Pio, Miracle Man instead."
2,Earthy Maine Music,"At first listen this band comes across like a howling nor'easter...angry and grey, purposeful and destructive...then, like the clearing westerly wind that follows the storm, a sunny cool dryness settles in and leaves the listener refreshed and fulfilled never wanting more. The Boneheads have filled the canvas with sound, and there is no room for the listener to search for meaning; nor is there a need to. Next time one can only hope for a less grandiose production; more of their Presque Isle roots and less of their Portland showboating...still and all, Donkey is a good ride ."
4,Rootsy Bluesy Cognac Sippin' Music,"Some really wicked good guitar work, vocals and songwriting by Steve Jones. The only suggestion I would make is that the Boneheads limit the writing to Steve Jones. The Boneheads' ""democratic"" approach to songwriting results in every member of the band contributing at least one song. Because each band member's variety of styles and influences don't necessarily ""meet in the middle"", the result is an album that sounds like 5 guy's going in on a solo project. Music fans who liked Keith Richards' solo albums and Exile on Main Street, will like the songs written by Steve Jones. For those that like the laid-back blues of Dr. John, the other band members put out some Cajun Funk that will make you reach for a cold beer every time. All in all, this is a talented bunch of guys. They just need to realize where the majority of talent is allocated, and make it a group effort to showcase Steve Jones."
1,step bumper receiver,this item dose not come with no hardware compare to the other step bumper receiver it should have said NO HARDWARE INCLUDED also the hole that bolts to the bumper was too small for the 3/4 hole on the step bumper no I don't need to addbut since I had cut the hole bigger and repaint it was much cheaper than returning for a refund I got it to work butwhen you sell a product you need to make sure things are going fit than making alteration and buying hardware kurt hashardware come with there bumper hitch and it almost looks the same
2,Basic,Got what I paid for. They just don't last that long after a few uses. Won't buy again that's for sure.
5,Nice!,"I agree with Jacey, this is a great shirt, especially for the price!My hubby wears it at once a week (he would probably wear it more if I would let him) lol."
5,Chaps Shirt review,These are REALLY nice shirts...nicer than I expected them to be...very high quality for the price!
3,The Truth,"I gave this book a 3 because it was readable but does not tell the complete truth. This is also a book Christians should read but not because Islam is the truth but because the author is unable to reconcile the reality of Jesus with the unlikely prophethood of Muhammad. The reader should first study Muhammad, his life, his behavior and his obvious weaknesses. Even the Koran itself informs us that Muhhamad broke promises when he found it advantageous. Readings in the Koran and from Muhammads life will point to a man searching for God, who created a religion by copying ancient Biblical and Judaic texts, combining those with his own cultural nationalism. For example: A. Deedat claims that the Koran is a mathematical miracle based on the number nineteen. Readers of the Bible realize that many ancient peoples used numerology to hopefully become one with God.Yes a book worth reading..It confirms that Jesus is the Prophet."
5,Outstanding for the price,I bought this device for our office when we lost our 2nd admin. It arrived quickly and was super easy to use and install. It works great - and for a great price. The remote is a must have.
2,"Ordered 2 - 1 nonfunctional, other with multiple problems","I ordered two of these products (alarm plus remote) for the downstairs of a two story house. I set them both up, and only one worked. I traced the problem with the other one to the remote control, which was completely non-functional (nothing happened when pressed buttons). I could turn on both units with the one functioning remote, but only one of alarms seemed to have the exit delay stated on the package. I should mention that the chime option is quite loud, and without the exit delay it was loud enough to wake up the kids upstairs who were already in bed. They both worked the first night, but the next night one of them was giving false alarms every couple hours during the night for no apparent reason. I had to turn it off as it is useless for security purposes if it just randomly goes off.This is the lowest rating I have given a product I have ordered on Amazon, but as you can see from the above it was deserved."
4,Old school Black Thrash,"Great new Black/thrash album with an old school '80's feel. Highly recommended for fans of old Possessed, Kreator, Destruction, Celtic Frost/Hellhammer or Nifeheim and Desaster. On Pulverised Records."
2,"Good when it works, has to be reset every 2 weeks","I bought this router in December and it works just fine when it is working. The problem is, every 2 weeks, it stops working and you have to waste time calling customer support. That call normally wastes about an hour of my evening. I am on hold right now trying to get a replacement and I have again, wasted about 1 1/2 hours on the phone with customer service. Very unprofessional."
1,Somehow linksys hates their customer,This router has a tiny number for the limit of maximum connections. Each pc easily generates 20 connections by opening a few web pages.This router from linksys would always block your connection to internet when it has four or more computers connected to it.Linksys hates their customer by ever putting this thing onto the market.
1,"Linksys, stay away","This is my third Linksys router. All have the same issues with dropping wireless connections and requiring resets often. I finally put a digital timer ahead of this router to restart it every four hours. This usually keeps things humming along. I'm switching to Buffalo brand routers, they can run DD-WRT too. Buffalo always runs steady, no hiccups. Linksys along with Microsoft need to be sued for selling junk products."
1,I hate this pos,"Like others have said, you have to reset this thing quite often--if it even connects at all. I almost smashed my laptop because of this thing a little bit ago. Stay Away!"
1,BOOOO!!!!,"I had to move mine and have it plugged into its own power strip, so when it decides to stop doing its job, I can easily flip the power switch with my toe. Last night, I restarted it no less than 5 times in a 3 hour time frame... Don't be afraid of other routers by the same brand though...this one just sucks... I have an old wired one works great, never had a problem, and am waiting for a new wireless one to arrive in the mail... They all look the same, and the numbers are very close, The one I read as the one to buy, and the one I am waiting for is the WRT54GL... maybe you should check it out instead."
1,"Outdated, don't bother with it","The wrk54g is outdated and poorly functional with newer devices. Mine was requiring rebooting often and had an interference problem when used with Samsung Galaxy tab. Cisco does not support this device as you cannot get updated firmware. Don't waste you time with it. Try a Belkin, I've had good luck with my n600. Or perhaps a Dlink.Terry"
5,Relaxation music with a kick,I love his music. This CD just confirms that. Very good background music to relax by. Some of the selections have a little spice to them. It's that Spanish flair coming out I guess. Could listen to it everyday.
1,Avoid this product-buy some other case.,"This product is garbage. The bottom corners hold down the return and menu keys and will lock up your 680.Further, the stitching is uneven on the SD card slot.The top access hole for the ringer switch is offset and requires a lot of pressure and a fingernail to slide the switch.I would think this was a factory second it is so poorly made.It is just garbage, you should avoid this product.There is just nothing good to say about it.I used to like Krussel, but their products have been going downhill.I have emailed them multiple times trying to get a response and they will not respond."
2,Significantly limits the ease of use of the phone.,"I had this case on for about two grueling months until I finally made the decision to remove it and I couldn't be happier. While offering protection, the case dampers both the touch screen and the keyboard with its poor materials and design. Typing short text messages became such a pain that I almost stopped sending them completely. Small buttons on the touch screen in the top or bottom edges would have to be pressed hard with a fingernail in order for it to register and the screen cover would often trap debris behind it which would have to be cleaned by removing the case. The case also makes the phone much bulkier to the point that I could barely get it in my jeans pocket. I bought a silicon case instead which was many times better. Stay away from this product."
3,Good movie For Child Scary - Funny Movie,A boy and his Hollywood Model mother lease a castle in Slyvania on the request of her mothers underhanded boyfriend. The castle has never left the hands of the Clothanko Family until now. The Little ghost was ordered to protect the Family Castle from outsiders. Now she has to befriend little boy to help her keep the castle from being turned into a spa by the mothers swindeling boyfriend.
3,Good but Cheesy,My neice is 4 years old and she loved this movie. As an adult I tought it was corny but it had a good story line. The Little boy and Girl ghost were good casting but the mothers boyfriend was too predictable in his reactions. Not a very good actor. This movie could have been a hit with better casting. But kids do not notice this and think it is great. It is a fun movie for the whole family- adults will laugh because of the poor acting.
1,A Disappointment,"Frankly, I was disappointed by this film. Given the premise, I felt there was so much more that could be done than was done. Comparing it to, say, ""Casper Meets Wendy"" - which is in the same genre - the former was fast-paced and imaginatively conceived while the latter was a plodding dud. Even an old ""Topper"" episode made richer use of the comedic possibilities than this.Don't waste your time."
5,Fun for kids,"My young kids enjoy watching this movie. It's cute, magical, imaginative and entertaining. Ghosts, castles and fantasy mixed with humor."
1,Not as good as I had hoped.,I have poor circulation in my legs and neuropathy as well. My husband often massages my legs for me and it helps quite a bit. I was hoping these would somewhat perform as a massage. The squeezing was very minimal. It took several minutes to build up enough pressure to squeeze at all. It is also very noisy. I didn't get relief at all from this even just as a relaxing massage.
2,Had to return,"Had to return product, charger wasn't in the box, the pump was broken, didn't work with batteries. Was able to retun product, waiting for refund."
3,Pleased,"I was very happy with the condition of the book. Not surprised because most times with amazon the books are in very good condition. This company tho does deliver what they say, nothing more nothing less."
5,Best Felt Pen Ever,No smudge - no pressure needed - bold - lasts long - better than Flair or any other!!
3,Camera not what expected....,"I had an Advantix camera years ago and my Mom had one that just broke. I ordered this one on line and didn't realize it was of such a ""cheap"" quality and beat up, for the price I was paying.(the online photo made it look brand new) It still works, but it sounds ""rough"" winding. Hopefully Mom can get through the abundant roles of advantix film she has stockpiled before it dies."
3,new year present,I was very happy when my friend had finally bought me the photograph machine which I had been asking for more than 6 months. I had really liked the shape\zoom\specifications of the machine. But was shocked to see my film rewinding just after the few films I had taken because of the easy reach of rewinding button. Anyway I was happy to see my photos quickly. But it was another shock time for me when I finally saw my photos. Some were not very clear\some had different colors like white river instead of a blue one or a very pale yellow furniture instead of a bright one. And faces of people were not very clear.
4,NO MID-REWIND,"I purchased this camera after reviewing the specs and was told there was a mid-roll rewind option. After recieving the camera the manual stated the roll of film can not be reuse once you rewind it. All the cameras I purchased in the past have this feature, but to me if a camera has a mid roll rewind feature the film should be able to be used again. Also it seems that you have to tell the developer to put the date the photo was taken or they put the date it was developed on all them. But it does take nice pictures."
4,Best Bang for your $$Buck$$,"I was shopping for several weeks to find a camera that was in my price range, and had all the features I needed. The Kodak Advantix F600 is the one! This handsome camera takes beautiful classic, horizontal, and panoramic shots. If your looking for an excellent camera at a reasonable price, order your Kodak Advantix F600 right now!"
5,What a find!,"I discovered Jenifer McLaren a month ago after a colleague mentioned seeing her in concert, then I bought Nightlight. What a find! I love Dynamite, which fits well into the nightmares we've all lived with since 9/11, and Go, which reminds me of how quickly life can pass us by. But my favorite is Quiet Heart (Would it be a shame if I left with a quiet heart?) ... and Slow Emergency. And then the rest....well, shoot, they're all my favorites! Hope to see more from Jenifer."
5,WOW!! Can I give 6 stars?,"Discovered this album pretty much by surprise. I mean, WOW! this has gotta be the best female artist CD I've heard in a while. Put it this way. I've got her song ""Go!"" stuck in my head for quite some time - and I've gotta hear her song every morning first thing I wake up!Can't wait to hear for more from this wonderful surprise, Jenifer Mclaren."
5,Hard to find!!!,These pens are difficult to find and they are expensive in the store. These came quickly and I'll order again online because it was so easy and reasonably priced.
4,Flair stick pens,"This is a pen that i have used for many years, but can no longer buy locally, so I was delighted to find them,"
3,Ink?,Not as much ink flow as previous version of Flairs. Miss the grooves on the barrel. can't find locally. Great service.
3,slight change from the original,I have used these brand/make of pens for the past couple of years and although the pen's writing surface is the same I don't like that they increased the width of the barrell. Still a good pen.
4,Perfect,Are dramatic writing is very smooth.Are dramatic writing is very soft and pretty colors. I've also given her and liked.
4,good price,"We needed these for a school art project. Budget cuts meant we had to buy them ourselves, so I was glad I could find them at a good price here on amazon!"
1,"Wrong pen, wrong quantity, what gives?","I received an open box with just 10 pens--two shy of the advertised 12--and the image of the pen on the box varied from the actual pen. I can't yet speak to the quality of the pens I received, but regardless it was not the pen I ordered."
3,Great for kids who don't have the patiance for mr. Claremont,couldn't find the full version of the novel so I bought this one which is fine and does get most of the plot across but that is about it. At some points so much is left out that you have no clue why something happened let alone how. However if you have a 9-12 year old who loves X-men and can't wait to see the movie then this is pretty good because the Claremont one (which I am reading now) Has too much cursing and is way too detailed for most people under 17. So I guess for this books audience it is above par.
4,"Good Product, Delivered in a Timely Fashion",This book is good for those long thoughts on the can and help you have a brain teaser to take your mind off....other things.
1,"TERRIBLE PRINT QUALITY, GREAT MUSIC, OUT OF SYNC","And that pretty much sums it up. If you want to actually SEE anything of this movie, you have to buy ""The Harry Langdon Collection, Lost and Found"". That edition has a beautifully restored print that is absolutely stunning compared to the cheap crap quality of the A2Z video. Unfortunately, the music on Lost and Found edition is not so good. I had to turn off the sound to make it through the movie.On THIS DVD, although the picture quality is poor, the un-named organist has provided a perfect soundtrack.Alas, it goes out of sync after the first scene or two and the music accompaniment, with all it's perfectly inflected moments that should fit the action tightly, is about 3 seconds LATE to the picture.I recommend buying the Lost and Found collection despite the less satisfying soundtrack."
5,Unwind with Buddha!~,Great combo of popular songs with the Buddha Bar/Lounge theme. Great way to unwind after a night of dancing.
5,One of the standards in the AP field,"Got the 2nd ed for $0.79 rather than the 3rd for ~$100. I realize many years have passed but as far as the techniques of AP control, the fundamentals remain the same. There might be much greater awareness of greenhouse gases and ozone, with stricter regulations but the chemistry and engineering behind the control of tropospheric NOX and SOX, along with PM and VOC have not change."
5,Excellent,"This is a great album for a slow Sunday morning, or for a little peace at the end of the work day."
3,3.5 out of 5,"NOt what I expected. Heard the song redwoods on a blog and fell in love with it, Mid-western rock song. Steady Acoustic, with an easy riff, the song Redwoods is great! The rest of the album doesn't live up to that song but a talented guy he is. Hope to see a show of his...."
5,Excellent!,"I actually have the blue one. No difference, except the color. Any way, mine works great and it's fun the play the Chao adventures. (Sonic adventure 1 and 2) I'm always running out of space. But it's my fault. I play Shenmue, Sonic Adventure 2, Crazy Taxi... games like that. And i have alot so... whatever..."
4,Enjoyment of the trading cards purchased,I like the product especially that it had force and damage counters. also a few new cards I did not have and two new shiney cards
5,"if you don't like the movie, you will still like the game!!!","honestly i would only see the movie twice because1)awosome special effects2)the fact that it was star warsthe acting was weak,and it was like star wars and a disney love movie combined,NOT a good combination.but this game is great!!!the cards are cool.i espically like that it comes with everthing you need!!!if you think pokemon, yu-gi-oh(or what ever it is),etc is stupid (like me)you still might like this game."
4,Not for shoes,"I bought this to cover the bare leather spots on my sneakers. Where the shoe flexes, the paint from the marker has cracked and is pealing off. I can see this having other uses, as it has excellent coverage and made my shoes look new. Too bad it wouldn't stay on the flexible part of the shoe. Marker is very much like a soft, wet crayon and quickly wears away as you use it. Once the point has worn off its hard to do any detail work. Still this is a good product and I would recommend it on surfaces that don't flex or bend."
1,Should have listened,Should have listened to the previous review. Paid $80 and received two UNCAPPED markers in a huge box. Ridiculous. Will report to amazon. DO NOT BUY.
3,Nothing new for an experienced developer,May be my expectations were too high but I was kind of disappointed by this book.I was hoping to find things like getting a thread dump programmatically and more useful examples.I think that this book is for beginners to intermediate level not for advanced level developers.
5,Now my favorite Bible,"There's always more than one way to say something, and having four Bible translations side by side proves it! Little nuances of meaning are revealed by the different wordings, and I find myself many times restating a verse in a way that is not exactly like any of them. It is a big fat book, but it is still a lot easier than juggling four big books! I highly recommend it for any serious studier of scripture."
3,Not suitable for in-depth study,"The text is small due to the multiple versions, the notes which are in the original versions have not been included (possibly for brevity), the physical size and weight makes it less portable. Suggest the NRSV or New Jerusalem versions are far better alternatives."
5,Great Bible,"I really like this Bible, the different translations help any theology student or laymen with this marvelous book."
2,Plastic Pulley,"The pulley on my OEM belt tensioner is metal, and has worked great for 13 years (160,000 miles). The pulley that comes with this belt tensioner assembly is plastic. A Techtip from Gates' website tells customers about how inferior plastic pulleys are, and how Gates only sells metal pulleys with their tensioners.http://www.gates.com/file_display_common.cfm?thispath=Gates%2Fdocuments%5Fmodule&file;=AutoTTPerformanceTensioners433%2D0794%2EpdfI wrote to Gates to ask them why this pulley is plastic, especially when their own website says that you should only buy metal pulleys, and they just ignored my e-mail.In addition to being plastic, the pulley doesn't align very well. My serpentine belt is riding on the very edge of the pulley. I expect both the pulley and the belt to wear out prematurely."
2,"Uncomfortable, and leaves residue","This is the worst pair of lifting gloves I've ever had. I'm trying to stick with them just to make sure that I get my money's worth, however there are two large problems I will share with you.1) Use of the gloves leaves a black ""stain"" on your hands. You can wash it off, but the fact that this is still happening after about 25 uses of the product is just weird and inconvenient. Previous lifting gloves never did this.2) Oddly, the gloves seem to create pain in my palm during some lifts - for reasons I don't fully understand. However near the end of my workout I'm doing tricep extensions, and the gloves seem to cut painfully into my palms at that point. Again, its a weird thing that never happened with any previous gloves.Given these two factors I just can't recommend these gloves."
1,Bait and Switch,"Do NOT order these gloves. You will not get what is pictured. You will receive a cheaper, very thinly padded pair of gloves from what is pictured. A complete bait and switch."
1,Great Marker! ....or at least it was,"At first I wasn't impressed because it wouldn't go long before the ink would lighten on whatever I was writing on.But I noticed, when I shook it, the ink reserve would rattle.During shipping the ink reserve must have been jarred loose. I popped off the back cap and pushed it down with with a pencil.Now that it isn't rattling around anymore, this thing seems to write forever!Edit: Only a few months old and the marker has already dried up... I have Sharpies that have lasted for years..."
4,Learning Curve Required,"This is merely one tool required to properly polar align your scope if you want to get a solid 3-star alignment with your Go-To. However, it isn't completely fool proof. After multiple attempts and the use of a small bubble level, I think I have the alignment process figured out. As mentioned in the manual, the constellations don't fit in the field of view of this scope. It requires working with both of your eyes open so you can properly rotate the scope to get the constellation alignment correct. Then you have to move your stand around, re-level it, and also change the dec of your mount. It likely will be an iterative process unless you get lucky. But this tool is a definite must have if you want to get the alignment correct. Being able to properly polar align my scope has made my viewing experience much more satisfying."
5,vmu-the best memory card,"the visual memory unit (vmu) for dreamcast is one of sega's greatest achievments. it lets you display secret data during head-to-head matches with other players. it also doubles as a mini gameboy,only cheaper. it only has one flaw:only 200 blocks of memory. and with games that take up 180 blocks you'll have to buy lots of 'em if you are a serious gamer. but overall it's a must buy for dreamcast gamers."
4,"Great Memory Card, Bad Gadget","The Sega Dreamcast VMU is one of the coolest things ever to hit consoles- it put a screen in your controller, held your files, acted as a clock, and held games that you could take on the go. You can also transfer files without a console. However, the quality of the games is poor, and they typically take up 128 of your available 200 blocks, which means that you need either another VMU or a 4X card if you want to store your saves and have a game."
5,The best memory card ever,"Simple fact, the VMU was the best memory card ever made. And, chances are, it always will be. With it's own screen you could see in the controller while playing, it often gave you extra information or mini-games you couldn't get elsewhere. Played cool animations while you were playing, and mostly just sat there and looked cool.If you managed to get a battery for it, you could even play some extra mini-games after you pulled the thing out of your controller. It was like it's own little mini-gameboy getting stuck into your controller. It's just too bad game designers decided to go back to the boring old flat memory cards after the dreamcast died."
5,vmu,the vmu is really awesome ive had one before and lost it and i couldnt save my files without it. it is really neat how it displays the game logo when you insert a game into the dc. so i give this product a thumbs up.
3,"It's an okay memory card, but...","This memory card (or Visual Memory Unit/VMU) is an original idea for saving games. Now you can play minigames, custimize your existing game, and hook up to another VMU to trade information, or just delete save data. In some games, this memory unit shows info (for instance, In Resident Evil Code: Veronica, it displays your health). There is one problem: Memory space. There is not enough space. 200 blocks just doesn't cut it. Example, most minigames require 128 blocks of memory. Then you get a game like Dino Crisis and it's 8 blocks. So far so good....until you get a game like Shemmue, which is 80 blocks. So, you didn't have enough space to save Shemmue because of the minigame, and now you need to delete memory or buy another card....Frustrating, huh? If all your concerned with is memory, get a 4x card. If you care more about a LCD screen and some buttons, get a VMU. Your choice."
3,IT NEEDS MORE SPACE,THIS MEMORY CARD NEEDS MORE SPACE. IT ONLY HAS ENOUGH SPACE TO SAVE TWO OF MY GAMES.I MADE A BAD CHOICE TO GET IT BUT IT NICE FOR THE MINI GAMES BUT THATS IT. IF THEY MAKE ONE THAT CAN HOLD MORE SPACE I WOULD GET IT.
5,There really isn't much to say.,This VMU comes in a nice clear blue case and has 200 blocks of storage. I personally love the idea of a VMU because of the functionality of it. You can download mini games to it and play them on the go with Gameboy like controls. There is not much to this review because there really isn't much to say. It is exactly as described and came brand new in the package complete with instructions and a battery already in it.
4,Sega VMU!,"Its the original, still working after 10 years on a shelf somewhere. An interesting design, but light on storage space. I would recommend the VMU tool which can be found online and burned on to a CD. This program will boot up on your dreamcast and allow you to unlock additional blocks on your vmu and customize the image on the screen and install minigames. There are so many reasons that the Dreamcast is still a relevant system 2 and a half generations later, and this is one of them."
5,good stuff,Rinse with baking soda just before using. Makes them taste like artichokes. Do not save them after rinse.top product
3,Not as nice as I bought in the store.,"Kroger quit carrying this brand of artichokes in their natural food section, so I was thrilled when I saw that it was carried online with Amazon. I was dissappointed when I opened my first can and discovered that it was a cheaper line than I had been buying. The inside of the can was not lined in white."
4,de referencia,"Dentro de las pocas grabaciones que existen de esta obra, esta es probablemente una de esas que se acostumbrar llamar como ""de referencia"". Excelente la interpretación del barítono ""Elías"" y en general lo solistas La orquesta emociona e impacta en todo momento. Unico detalle, en algunos momentos la cuerda de sopranos se pierde un poco."
3,Not My Favorite Piece,"The oratorio society with which I sing was performing excerpts from this work, so I purchased this recording for a reference. I found it a bit tedious to listen to the entire piece (although there are some wonderful movements), and was glad that I had the score in front of me as it is sung in German (as it should be). The performance is very good, but the sound quality does not hold up as well as some of Sawallisch's other recordings from the same time period (namely his outstanding Bayreuth Wagner recordings); others have called it ""warm"" - I consider it dense and somewhat muffled. I'm not sorry I purchased it, but I don't think I will listen to it very often. For the record, I did not especially enjoy singing it either..."
5,We Already Know,"Nos americanos ja sabemos da musica brasileira. Eu morei no Brasil por um bom tempo e escutei musica demais!! Entao, eu sei que Os Paralamas sao uma banda exelente!! Mas eu concordo que muito gente nao sabe dos Paralamas.Todo mundo deve comprar e escutar esse CD.Um dos melhores CD's que eu tenho.One of the best bands in Brasil, in my opinion!!BUY THIS ONE!"
4,Good Stuff,"First of all, the bad stuff: at times Marshak's and Culbreath's prose is a little dense and difficult to get through. Sometimes I put the book down just to take a break! But on to the parts that got the four stars: this book, unlike many recent Star Trek novels, is rich with emotion, novelty and philosophy. I have to disagree with the reviewer who complained that the authors made Kirk and Spock into ""closet lovers"": So what if they did? Their relationship comes off as beautiful and touching. And as for ""dominating women,"" that is very in keeping with the wonderful Romulan Commander's character, and I find it--well, silly that a reader would be threatened by that. Anyhow, like I said, sometimes hard to get through, but well worth the effort. I've ordered the sequel, The Fate of the Phoenix, and can't wait to read it!"
2,"Talented writers, poor characterization","I'm kind of embarrassed to review this book. I loved it and the sequel when I was about thirteen. I had no concept of the idea of slash at the time. Now? It's thinly disguised fanfiction. And let me add that there is really, really good fanfiction out there, but this is not it. Every Star Trek book by these authors has heavy duty Kirk/Spock subtext and the subtext is practically text in this one. Add the melodramatic storyline and...it's just not good Star Trek."
2,"This was like college hot dogs, grade D, barely edible","This would've done better as a totally original sci-fi novel, being put into an established universe like Star Trek's was a bad idea. Kirk, Spock and the other characters we know all act very out of character in this book. There is so much thick, sludgey, pedantic psychobabble in this story that it seems like the authors were trying to write a Dune or a Fellowship of the Ring, and failing miserably. If the characters had spent less time talking in circles like drunk philosophy students, maybe they would've had the time to plan and take more successful action against the antagonist Omne."
2,I'd hardly waste my money,"So it's small enough to carry almost anywhere.So what?It's not very comprehensive,particularly for a beginner.The most important thing it's missing is idiomatic expressions,which are very important.Also,there are many commonly used words not included in this dictionary."
5,Very well received.,I ordered this for my grandson's 4th birthday and he loves it. He's a bright little chap and enjoys playthings involving an element of thought and some manual dexterity. I really appreciate the convenience of ordering items from my home in the UK for delivery to my family in New York - as usual this item arrived in good time and good condition.
1,Waste of money,Problems with camera from first day. Picture quality was not consistent. After one month shutter broke. Kodak wanted me to pay postage and would not guarantee a no charge repair. Too many items of repair did not fall under warranty. Also film cost is much higher. Eventually just threw the camera out when I was told by local repair shop that cost to repair could be more than purchasing a new camera
4,gotta get this one!,this camera is great I received this as a gift. Takes great shots in very low light. We went to the circus and all the pictures I took in the dark came out brillant! easy to use and I love the fact I can take panoramic shots. It is light weight and user friendly! great value it is a must have.
2,Not satisfied at all.,"I've had too many problems with this camera and ended up returing it after trying out 2 of them. I find the viewfinder dark to look through making it very hard to take photo's in any other light except very bright. The camera always defalts to 4x7 size leaving me with a lot of cutting to do at home (Kodak told me this is a camera defect). The date/time stamp on the back is so small and faint it's hardly worth it. Every roll of film I have developed comes out differently, whether it's every photo with red-eye, or skin discoloration... There is also a problem with the film memory itself, making the format's come out different than what it was set at (besides the default) Kodak told me it's because the film is so new they are still ""working on it"". The camera does take very sharp and clear photo's but unfortunatly there was just too many other problems for me to continue using it."
4,pretty good for a quick overall lesson or review,This game is a pretty good review of ancient civilizations. It would be very good for students even those who may be older. It could serve as a refresher if you need one. For kids 7-13 it is ideal. I plan on using it in my classroom for a good review toward the end of the year once we have went over several of the ancient civ. empires. I would recommend unless you already have a lot of ancient history knowledge.
5,"Great fun, and learn at the same time!","We love the Professor Noggin card games. Older kids/adults can play using the harder questions, and younger kids can use the easy questions, so kids have a chance to beat the adults. It is a fun way to reinforce what we've learned in school...or it gives us information about a topic we didn't cover. We've brought this game on trips, and played with extended family and with friends, and it's always a big hit with everyone!"
1,Not fun at all,"This game is abousolutly terrible, if you even call it a game. We had a party at my school so I tried playing it, my friends and me agree it was bad. Sure the game teaches lots of history, but not much action is involed. Their was no action involved. I would have rated this 0 stars but it only went down to 1. I don't even know what this suppose to be. All you can use are this giant playing cards with pictures and a dice that doesen't have pointy corners. This looks more like a box of flash cards.I rated this game a 2 on durability because the cards did rip easy (Using common sense) and the dice was the only thing that got it a 2"
5,The Believer's Rich Inheritance in Christ,"The Good Lord confirmed the ministry of this blessed man of God through powerful signs and wonders.This book reveals the privilages the believer has in Christ Jesus; the power that is available through the Holy Spirit to do exceedingly and abundantly more than we could ever hope for. Wigglesworth shows the believer how to secure G-d's favor on their life, obtain freedeom from sin, practice the presence ofG-d, take authority over the enemy, and experience the supernatural.This book is a wonderful faith builder, simply written, and very positive. Only believe, all things are possible."
3,Smith Wigglesworth On Spirit Filled Living,Rough starting but very interesting after reading more. It takes real concentration on this book and a real desire to know what you want from the book.
3,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, not nearly as good as the author's Basic Aerobatics. It does not have the same (excellent) consistent description of each maneuver. In fact, several of the pages look like reproductions of handouts.Overall, appears to be thrown together, to capitalize on the success of the initial book. Purchase ""Better Aerobatics"" if you want detailed descriptions and instructions for advanced aerobatics -- ""Better Aerobatics"" is a vastly superior book."
4,good product,"relatively simple to install, with fairly clear instructions - the only issue really is that if you want to install it on anything except the direct mount (for example, suspended ceiling, or at an offset from the ceiling) you have to buy extra components which aren't necessarily easy to track down. Once up it is solid and stable."
3,Worked for My IN3914,"This mount worked well for our InFocus IN3914. It was easy to install.My only real con is the price. Amazon had the cheapest price around, but that was still a lot for what the product is."
5,"Rachmaninoff, Piano Concertos Nos. 1-4/Rhapsody On A Theme By Paganini",I am truly enjoying them. I play them almost daily.
4,Not the best but great regardless,"Rafael Orozco's performances of these concerti are amazing. They may not be the absolute best performances, but they are indeed very good. The Rach 3 is stunning. Orozco's spectacular technique allows him to focus on the interpretation rather than the notes. The first movement is powerful; the second is beautiful; and the third is incredible. The first movement ossia cadenza is very convincing and probably one of my favorite readings of this cadenza. Orozco has a great talent for bel canto playing when the pieces warrant such. His balance is very good, which cannot be said for a lot of pianists who play these concerti. This is an overall wonderful set, and I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to listen to good performances of these pieces."
1,Defective CDs at Amazon,"The performances are excellent, but Amazon has a bad batch of CDs. I received a replacement for the first CD I received, which skipped during the 3rd movement of Piano Concerto No. 3. The replacement was defective in the same exact spot. Until Amazon can verify that they have a new batch that does not contain this defect, do not buy this CD."
2,Fancy vs. Fundamental,"As a new microwave user--and enthusiastic one, I bought this book hoping to obtain useful basic information about cooking basics: how to cook bacon, usual time for soups, problems and cautions re: warming up leftovers, and so on. When I started to peruse the book I was confronted with fancy recipes and ""special"" tips for food presentation that were focused on a different mode of ""cuisine"" than what would be ;useful for me. But I respect that many readers would be pleased with the book's information and suggestions."
4,"A cute toy, but my girls didn't like it.","My 12 month old got this for her birthday. She seems to enjoy opening and closing the mailbox, but that's about it. My two year old played with it for a few minutes and then moved on. I thought they would really like it, but I guess not. It's a cute addition to the playroom, but I have yet to see it utilized. It does tip over easily, but shouldn't cause any harm."
5,No Bills in this Mailbox,"My 14-month old son loves this mailbox. He enjoys opening and closing the mailbox door and putting the pieces of ""mail"" in the slots. I know it will be great toy to learn colors and shapes. This is definitely worth purchasing. The only drawbacks are that it does tip easily (I've had to keep the toy against the wall so that it won't fall over when my son slams the mailbox door shut) and the buzzing bee should have an on/off switch (the buzzing noise can be a bit too much at times)."
4,Unsafe for infants learing to pull-up!!!,"Great toy - fun, durable, educational. However, if your infant is learing to pull-up, this toy is not for her. It easily tips over, and the mailbox door flips down and whacks them on the head. I would wait until your child is standing on his/her own before purchasing this toy."
4,very happy with this toy,"This is a great toy. My son loves it. When he was learning to stand we had to weigh it down with the corner of a piece of furniture, but once that was done, he played with it happily."
3,Annoying to my mommy and daddy,"I have to say that my dad took the buzzing bee right off the mailbox after hearing it only a few times. That said, I have also tipped over many times (once cutting my lip) using this to stand next to. So maybe it's not too good a toy for a one-year old who is sometimes unsteady. However, I really love the mail and the little cups! As a whole this toy is not very exciting."
5,nice toy,"My 1 year old got this for her birthday, and she really enjoys it. Older sis (3) also enjoys playing with it. They both like opening and closing the mailbox and sticking the mail through the slot."
2,Too much bulk for the bang,"My one year old daughter received this toy as a christmas gift last year and rarely plays with it. For its size, there is very little to engage young kids. The bee is very annoying and the mail has no interesting markings or functions. Now that I've put it outside with her ride-ons, she uses it occasionally to mail objects but unless you have a great deal of space, I wouldn't recommend it."
4,you have mail,"I bought this mail box only after reading the reviews here. I will say that it was a pain to put together, but I find this product to be very durable. Yes it does tip over when your child trys to stand up on it. I just keep my foot on the base. as my son still needs help to stand up. This mailbox is cute and can no longer be found in stores. This seems to be the last place to purchase this item. All in all my son checks the mail everyday and spins the bee a couple times during the day. Well worth the purchase."
4,Very cute!,"My niece got this mailbox for Christmas and LOVES it. She is 19 months old, and loves spinning the bumblebee around to hear him buzz. It's very durable, and the perfect height for a toddler her size."
1,Maybe better for older kids in the age range,The age range on this toy starts at 6 months. I bought it for my son when he was 12 months (now 18 mo) and he has barely looked at it in the last 6 months. I noticed most of the positive reviews were from parents with kids 2+ so the appeal of this toy may grow on my son in the next 6-12 months. But the current play value of it has been a real disappointment.
3,"good concept, mediocre execution","I saw this product and couldn't wait to get it. Picking up the mail is part of our daily routine and now my 12 month old could get her own. I love the colors and selection of accessories.However, it took us 45 minutes to put together and required using two different screw drivers. Also, the base is not weighted so everytime my daughter opens the mailbox it falls on her. It's not heavy and hasn't hurt her but I don't like the idea of a large and awkward toy falling on her.great idea, bad execution"
3,Cute but very annoying and all-around not the best,"I bought this toy for my daughter because I thought it was adorable. While putting it together, I just about threw it through the window because the bee does NOT stop buzzing. It goes off at the slightest touch and just goes on and on and on. The batteries were removed from the bee before my daughter even saw the toy. My daughter recieved this at about 6 months and is 10 months now. She does enjoy playing with the mail, nesting cups, and some of the other features but she is not entertained for long. So many other toys have nesting cups and things to put into slots that I don't think this was the best purchase. In addition, it tips over easily when she tries to use it to stand or when trying to open the mailbox (which is difficult for an infant to open.)"
5,It's a hit!,"We got this mailbox for both of our children for Christmas. My duaghter is 8 months and my son is 4 years. They both love it especially the baby. There are ""envelopes"" and ""packages"" for her to chew on and she loves spinning the bee and the ladybug. My son loves to join in and play with her. This is a great toy to buy. Would recommend it to anyone. Lots of fun stuff to do on this one!"
3,Don't make the bumble bee go round,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas before she was old enough to play with it. My sister in law and I put it togethher very easily. When we went to try it out and spun the bumble bee around it broke off. We did not use a lot of force. Unlike most little tikes toys that are made tough! It seems the plastic used to hold the bumble bee on in is not suitable for much use or play. My daughter is 10 months old now and other than using the plastic pretend letters as chew toys, she's not interested in it."
3,makes them little people,"My son saw this toy at a photography studio and began playing with it (he was 6 mo. old), so I purchased one for him. He really likes to spin the lady bug. The worm doesn't seem to interest him and is a little difficult for him to move. He quickly figured out how to open the mailbox and loves to get his ""mail""! He is 8 months old now and can't quite get the mail into the box himself, but loves to pull it out. He gets excited when he opens the box. He recently began to enjoy the buzzing bee also. I know that when he is older and understands the concept of mail, he will enjoy it more. It is definitely very durable, but is easily pulled onto the child (my son has done so a few times). But, it doesn't seem to hurt him. I rated it 3 stars for fun, because it doesn't hold his interest for long periods of time."
1,Do NOT Buy!,I purchased this item for my daughter last Christmas and she has played with it on ONE time and that was on Christmas day. This toy is not fun at all. I do not recommend this purchase.
4,Creating a Buzz,"My 12 month old daughter got this toy for a Christmas present. She really enjoys placing the letters in the mail box and taking them back out. She also thinks the ladybug spinner and stacking boxes are fun. In addition, you only have to hit the bee to make it buzz and she gets a great thrill out of it everytime it goes off. I placed the box next to her playhouse. It is not too large and fits nicely. However, if it had not been a gift I probably would not have bought it. She does have a very small room and we have several other smaller toys that seperately do the same activities."
1,THIS TOY STINKS,"This is one of the worst toys my daughter ever received! She received the mailbox when she was 11 months old and she played with it maybe 3 times. The thing tiped over everytime she pulled up to play with the mailbox so maybe she was scared of it! I can't believe that Little Tikes didn't add weight of some sort to the bottom!!! The bee isn't that fun, all the other bugs are attached to the base and it has random sorting cups that come with it."
3,Fall from grace!!,My child was given this toy for a holiday gift and he hurt himself. First the toy isn't exactly bottom heavy so it topples over. The mail box flap that opens and closes is very strong and almost snaps closed. I am going to save it for him until he is older. The toy was fun for a three year old girl I had over. Beware of younger kids under age 1.
4,ALL THE BUZZ,My niece is 10 months old and she loves it. if it can withstand her it can withstand any child.
4,mailbox,We gave this to our grandson when he was 9 months old. I was amazed on how quickley he learned to put mail in the slot. He likes this toy alot. And at his age the other little play things as the lady bug etc are fun for him.
5,Ariza 's #1 Fan!!,"I've taken 4 TESOL courses with Dr. Ariza (2 Undergraduate and 2 Master's Level). Dr. Ariza is a wealth of knowledge when it comes to working with ESOL/LEP students. Because of the changing student population and related instructional needs in our modern day society, every teacher needs to be well-versed in ESOL strategies. Fortunately for teachers, many of the ESOL strategies serve double-duty as ESE strategies. The textbooks Ariza has written are ones every preservice and veteran teacher needs to keep for handy reference. Well worth every penny! Thank you Dr. Ariza for your dedication to TESOL."
2,Neat Idea - Cheap Toy - Dead Tadpole,"I bought this for my daughter and I was very disappointed. The habitat is very flimsy think plastic and although we followed the directions exactly as they were printed the tadpole died. I have a friend that bought one and the same thing happened. I called the company and they said they would send us a new tadpole, that was 6 months ago. The last I heard they had problems with the tadpoles they were breeding and they were sending us one in September. It's now October, so buyer beware on this item. I have another friend who looked up how to make a habitat and she bought a tadpole for about $1 at a pet store, I would suggest that route over this one."
3,They won't change into frogs,"I got my planet frog for a birthday gift in December in the mid west. I received my tadpoles on the 8th of January and they still have not changed into frogs. They are still alive and look exactly the same from when I got them. The tank is very easy to change the water in, they are easy to take care of, but they won't change into frogs. I would be really dissapointed if I was a child but we all laugh about it here at work, how I got 2 dudds. The book says that it takes about 6 weeks for them to change and I am going on 9 months really soon. I have thought about putting them in with my turtles but I think they would be an appitizer for them :) I wouldn't suggest this for a child....they would be really dissapointed...."
1,Don't waste your money on this.,"Sounded like a really cute, educational project. So I went for it. The flimsy plastic container was delivered with a coupon to send to Uncle Milton for the tadpoles/frogs. I mailed in my check. The check was received and cashed. I received a postcard advising that the weather was too hot to send the live animals. Two weeks later I received a card saying that it was too cold to send the live animals. I think this might be a scam and I'm sending both cards AND my cancelled check to the Better Business Bureau in California. The plastic container would have been more sturdy if they had built it out of 2 liter coke bottles. A really good idea done so badly. Very disappointed and want my money back."
1,Don't buy it,"We received this aquarium as a gift last August. I've received 2 shipments - one came in -20 degrees and other one came during normal temps and I met the mail man at the mailbox, so the test tube was not left in the mailbox too long. They were both dead. They have now told me that it will be next november before they may be able to get more tadpole hatchings. I've called local shops, but they don't sell tadpoles. So, although they are going to refund my frog cost, I'm still left with a plastic aquarium that will now meet the recycling dumpster. Very frustrating."
1,better chance of getting tadpoles from the North Pole,"Im just going to let other unsuspecting parents know that i never recieved any tadpoles,thus our children will not receive it.So you have to explain why they dont have the baby frogs and so on.The one thing i did gain out of this whole experince is if i want to get my children some tadpoles we just go to our local pond or swamp and get our own.The most expensive pet i never had.Better chance of getting tadepoles from the north pole. thanks for nothing planet rip off kids"
1,loss builds character?,"This toy is only appropriate if you want to teach your child what it is like to experience disappointment and death when they are young. For my son this was a long, sad lesson. Very high-maintenance for the parent. Be prepared, you'll have some explaining to do."
3,"Worth it for the cage, but get your own frogs.","Gave up trying to get the tadpoles to grow after 4 attempts - all died quickly.We went to PETCO and got two fire toads instead ($4 each, less than the Planet Frog tadpoles cost), for which the Planet Frog housing was perfect! It is light and has no loose gravel, so you can just rinse the whole thing out weekly in a large sink. After 12 months it is getting worn, but I'll probably buy another Planet Frog container again for the Fire Toads."
2,Buy a real tank instead!,"We finally received our tadpoles in November! How fun it was to watch them swim in their new plastic (flimsy) home. Ack...I knew at some point I would have to buy them a real tank, but thought I'd see if they turned into frogs first. The months past and nothing happened...November, December, January, February, March, April and whoah now mid-May. We finally got a froglet! He was adorable with his new legs! He swam around like a kid just learning how to ride a bike! Ahh but his crappy home was the beginning of the end. He got his leg caught in the ledge and died a half hour later. :-( We still have 1 more tadpole we are waiting on here. I will be out today buying him a new home so he doesn't end up like his friend. VERY sad to watch happen. I'm sorry I didn't just buy a real tank from day 1."
2,Our tadpole isn't growing either,"I ordered this for our 5 year old son for his birthday. We live in the suburbs of Chicago and since I sent in the form in January, I thought for sure they wouldn't send it until springtime at the earliest, due to the cold weather here. But, we got it by the end of January I'd say. I just ordered one and he's still alive, but not sprouting any legs or growing into a frog. He's a little bigger than when we got him, but definitely not becoming a frog anytime soon. I'm glad to see the other reviews here only to know that we're not alone. I liked the suggestions about feeding some other types of food to him, so I may try that and see what happens. Oh well, like someone else said, it's a good lesson in patience!"
3,Hang in there they do change,"We received our Tadpoles in Oct 2003. They have been very slow in developing and my children ages 3 and 5 go through different levels of interest. However, I beleive for the minimal investment it has been a great learing expeirence. One tadpole changed easter weekend and the other has gotten larger and is developing stubs. even after developing front legs it took a good month to get back legs then a couple weeks to loose the tail. I think that if you explain to the kids the process may take a while then it is a great learning tool. Just be patient!"
2,Flimsy,"I ordered this from another site for my 6 year old son. He was so excited about it, but I was less than thrilled when it arrived and I saw how cheap the habitat was. My son also hated the long wait (about 4 months!) for his tadpole (not the company's fault I guess.. they wait to ship until the weather is tadpole-friendly).We've had him for about 2 months now, and he still looks the same as the day we got him. After reading reviews here it sounds like it can take 6 months before we see an froggy-ness on him.I'm frankly tired of cleaning the tiny flimsy habitat, and I'm contemplating converting my son's old fish tank into a frog tank instead."
2,"cheap plastic ""tank""","The tank or habitat is made of the cheap flimsy plastic that barbie dolls are packaged in.(yes the packaging!)Very easy to bend...I thought it would be made of a durable acrylic plastic. But I was WRONG! It is not durable at all so if you have a little curious children who like to go up and touch the tank beware. It might just cave in or just fall apart...And the tadpoles cost about $6 more and you are NOT guaranteed the arrival of the tadpoles if your weather too cold. So if you were thinking of getting this as a Christmas gift, you might not be able to actually use it until spring."
2,at least it looks nice...,"It says in the instruction manul that the tads arrive in 2wks or less.2 weeks my toenail! After NINE MONTHS of waiting, 1 tad arrived dead with a bizarre cut on it and the other one survived for 2 hours. My advice: go to PetSmart and buy a Kritter Keeper for 8 bucks. then buy yourself a 15 buck treefrog. Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!"
4,Gret learning toy but have patience - it is nature!,"My son received this product for his birthday and loves his tadpole now frog. We had ordered two and one died about a month after we got it but the second one lived and is now a frog. It takes a while to become to fully become frogs (about 8-9 months) but hey, we don't create babies overnight either! The transoformation begins around month 6 though adn is so cool!!It truly is amazing to see the transformation from tadpole to frog and my kids love it!I recommend this kit and if they die - go buy another for a couple bucks! Trust me - they are easier to replace than a hamster which kids can tell the difference!"
1,Waste of Money,"I saved up my money to buy this kit after seeing it in a store with live frogs inside,. I received the tadpoles in September 2003, it's now 6 months later and they haven't changed. All I got is a new chore of changing water every week. This is so unfair to kids. I could have bought live frogs from the pet store instead. I wasted all my savings on junk!!!. Thanks for nothing."
3,"Looks great, but extremely flimsy","My 8 year old son begged me for this toy for Christmas. $25.00 later, we have a toy that looks great on paper, but unfortunately is made with plastic as thin and flimsy as paper too. I was very disappointed in the quality. The brown base is made of hard plastic, but everything you see in the picture that is clear, is made with flimsy plastic."
1,What a joke...,"We bought the habitat in March, ordered 2 tadpoles in April, waited months for them to arrive. One died within a few days and they sent us a new one. Waited, waited, waited, waited. Followed directions EXACTLY. About 3 months later, the other original one died. Another 2 months, the replacement died. Now we are 6 months out, never having seen a frog. Uncle Milton has taken their phone number off their website. I sent an e-mail to them and received an automatic reply saying someone would contact me within 2-3 days. A week later I sent it again. A month later I sent another e-mail, now the autoresponse says 5-7 day. I'm still waiting and my child very disappointed. Do NOT buy this product. Waste of money and lots of time."
1,NOT WORTH IT,"This is one of the lowest quality products I've seen in a long time -- the plastic is flimsier than most food packaging. I also find it completely misleading that it's not made clear that the cost of the tadpoles is not included, and that they in fact cost twice again the price of the aquarium. We're returning this product, so I can't address how educational or fun it is once the tadpoles arrive, though it was not fun for my daughter to be excited to get it and then so disappointed. There has to be a better way to watch tadpoles grow than through this product."
1,Bad purchase,My daughter received Planet Frog for Christmas 2010. It took 6 months for us to receive the tadpoles (2). It took 2 days for the first tadpole to die. The second one held on for about 2-3 months but never grew legs and never got any bigger. He died too. We followed all directions to the letter. We should have listened to the other reviews and stayed away from this product! Don't waste your time or money!
1,unacceptable quality,"Received this as gift, have not ordered the tadpoles yet. The quality of this product is just shocking. Think along the lines of the lightweight rigid plastics used to package products. Without saying anything negative, I passed the open product to my sister and asked her what she thought of it. Her jaw dropped. No one can believe how cheap the materials are. I can't even let my 5yo handle it for fear it will crack."
4,Birthday gift,"My eight year old is very excited about this gift. We have not yet sent out for the tadpole, but will soon. I am disappointed that this unit is made so flimsy. Other ""habitats"" we have purchased--the ladybug home, the insect habitat--are made with a very sturdy plastic. This unit is a flimsy plastic. The certificate is for only one tadpole and the shipping cost is high for just one tadpole. We will still enjoy this as we plan to keep it for future ""tadpole findings""."
4,One of ours waited over 2 years!,"We got our habitat in April 2002 with 2 tadpoles. One tadpole changed within 6 weeks, and then promptly went belly up (literally) on his first day as a real frog. The second one, whom we nicknamed 'little guy', was apparently traumatized by his brother's death and stayed as a tadpole for the next 2 years! Only recently (April 2004) has he changed into a frog. As I write this, he's coming out of the water, taking his first froggy steps. Let's hope he lives as least as long as a frog as he did as a tadpole!"
1,"Another ""Tadpoles Won't Change Into Frogs"" Experience","After 6 dead tadpoles on arrival, the two we've had since August, 2003 (8 months) ARE STILL TADPOLES. Contact with Uncle Milton yielded instructions to ""put it in a warmer place and feed them more"". Both points addressed in October, with no results. My 8 year old long since gave up interest and Uncle Milton wants to SEND US SOME REPLACEMENTS??? Gee, won't my child love flushing the ones we already have? Not!My rating? SomethingSeriouslyWrong and DefinitelyNotWorthIt!!!"
2,Disappointed,"My son received the Planet Frog habitat for his birthday. After waiting 8 anxious weeks my sons tadpoles finally arrived. We read and reread every bit of the information that came with the habitat and even invested in a few more books about frogs and tadpoles. Unfortunately, after two weeks both tadpoles had died. Not wanting to go through the disapointment of losing more, we opted to purchase one of the recommended types of adult frogs. After placing our new friend in the habitat he jumped and knocked the top right off. We are now holding it down with heavier items while we search for a more suitable habitat."
4,"Great for small frogs, Toads, or tadpoles!",Love this small tank for my classroom Pets!! Pretty durable and love the look of it! It has holes in top and easy to feed animals without taking off the lid!
1,THE FROGS ESCAPED.,"Why do you buy a frog aquarium? Most likely, to keep your frogs inside.Well, my frogs escaped. This piece of garbage toy came with the shoddiest lid I've ever seen, but I followed the directions to the T, so there should not have been a problem.Well, I have three tadpoles. I HAD three tadpoles and two frogs, but my two frogs are gone. Vanished. The little plastic lid was such a piece of crap - I checked the edges and they were slightly apart from the cheap plastic base.This thing is a piece of garbage. I am beyond upset about my escaped - and still missing! - frogs."
2,Cool looking - but not practical for frog catchers like my little girl!,This product looked to be perfect for my 4 year old because she loves catching frogs. When we got it in the mail we immediately were disappointed in the quality and how flimsy the plastic was. My daughter loved it at first (because she thought it looked cool) but this was not practical for containing frogs either because the lid would come off too easily. We ended up going out a couple weeks later and bought a sturdier frog container from Pet Smart.
1,Sad Disappointment,The tadpoles took forever and died the night they arrived. The kids were pretty sad about it. I would not do this again. Next time will try locally at a pet store or something.
5,frogs,i think that this is a great toy. you learn about metomorphosis and about diffrent caracteristics about frogs. the only hard thing is waiting till the tadpoles turn to frogs but overal i love this toy
2,I dont have this BUT here are my thoughts:,"I don't own frogs but I do own hermit crabs. this plastic piece of crap seems almost IDENTICAL to the hermit crab cove by the same company, Uncle Milton. The hermit crab cove is an EVIL thing not suitable for hermit crabs. I also heard that frogs need more than what this can offer so i will say dont buy this poo!!!!!thanks :)"
1,disappointed,"I sent my order for 2 tadpoles which you pay shipping and handling and an additional price for the extra tadpole, about $14, on may 24. I have yet to receive them.. Furthermore, the tank is very thin plastic and the quality is poor. You are better off going to walmart or a petstore and buying a plastic tank and putting a rock in it. It is less expensive and you wouldnt have to worry about it breaking. Finding tadpoles at a local pond is what we ended up doing and they turned into small toads that we fed fruit flies for a while and then released in our garden. Meanwhile I am still $40 or so in the hole after wasting my money on this horrific product. I finally sent a complaint letter to the company."
2,Could have been great,"I bought this, and sent off for tadpoles. They came. Three monthes later. They both never started turning into fRogs. Both eventually died. The cage itself is very flismsy.Here's what you do. Go to Petsmart. Spend seven dollars on a ten-gallon aquarium, and buy a ten dollar tree frog or seven dollar leopard frog.What? Junior wants tadpoles? Go to (...) and search 'tadpoles'."
1,Not worth the money!,"I bought this for my son who was 4 at the time. I thought it would be a cool thing for him to see nature and how it works. Well, we got the tank and it should be for adults only! Because it is sooo flimsy!! The top comes off too easily!! Then we waited 4 months for the teadpoles to even come. They survived two days!!! We were so dissapointed. After buying the tank and then having to buy the tadpoles I thought it was wrong to charge us for the tadpoles in the first place!! So we ended up going to the river nearby and catching our own. That was very fun. The tadpoles lasted about a month...then I decided back to the river they go beacause it STUNK sooo bad!! It was stinking up the house. All in all it was more trouble then it was worth. Save your money...Buy a regular aquarium and an adult frog at the pet store."
1,"I wish I could rate a ""0"" star!","This is a horrible toy. What a waste. Read the other reviews... Everything they say is true, it WILL happen to you! (And your poor child who has become attatched to something doomed to die!)DON'T BUY IT!!"
1,What a Scam-Don't Disapoint your Child-Don't Buy This!!!!,"We got this for my son last summer, sent off for our tadpoles and got a letter saying it was too cold to send them. Excuse me? It was August-How much warmer could it get? Anyway, Called and was told we got wrong letter and they would be shipping them soon. We got them, and they arrived fine, but here we are 7 months later and we have NO FROGS! One has died finally and the other is hanging on but my son still has faith that they will change soon. What a huge dissapointment for him, he had wanted this for a while and now we find out its all a crock. This is cruel to the children and the tadpoles, I will be complaing to the the Better business bureau as well as the company and will be sure not to buy anything else from them. Just a side note, we had also purchased the Aquarasaurs and they never hatched, another disappointment. This company thinks they can just sell anything-its ridiculous. Save yourself the aggravation and buy something else."
2,Plastic tadpoles would be better!,My daughter was REALLY excited about this gift. Tadpoles took 5 weeks to get. 5 weeks later the first one died and she was devistated. Neither tadpole made any changes and the second tadpole has now died. ...
1,Flimsy plastic - No Tadpoles yet (2 months),"The product as indicated by others, is cheap flimsy plastic. We sent away for the tadpoles over 2 months ago. They were quick to cash my check, but to date, no tadpoles. Customer service has been no help. They claim they'll get back to you within 2 work days, but it took more than a week. When we did get a call, the lady had a bad attitude and was chewing gum. I don't recommend the product or the company."
1,Tadpole/Frog,"I purchased this product in the store to use in my classroom. When I opened the box, I was disappointed in how flimsy the habitat was. The plastic is very thin and it doesn't weigh much, so while it is easily moved, it can also be easily knocked over. Each time we cleaned the habitat we were worried about it falling apart. The tadpoles that came lasted 1 month and then died. In that time barely any change happened. We replaced them with tadpoles from a pond and they developed much quicker. If you do buy this habitat, I would definitely get your own tadpoles from somewhere else. The company is VERY hard to get in touch with and when I finally did, they weren't very friendly or helpful. I would not purchase this item again."
1,Terribly Disappointed,I bought this toy for my son. He was so excited about being able to watch tadpoles turn into frogs. Unfortunately that never happened. Two of the tadpoles arrived after 12 weeks and dead in September (so weather was not an issue). The 2 that arrived alive lived a few months and never turned into frogs. I wouldn't recommend this for kids as they are tremendously disappointed with the toy.
1,Glorified Coke Bottle,"This product is made cheaply. It consists of material very much the same as a 2 liter coke bottle. If you truly attempt to raise a frog in this Good Luck. An actual frog could move this toy off of the shelf with a single hop. The distributor should be ashamed to sell such a cheap poorly constructed toy. And as for a tadpole coupon, expect to pay $5.99 for shipping of the presummably free tadpole and you only get one so pray it doesn't die."
2,"Cool idea, but habitat is very flimsy.","This is really a cool idea, but the habitat is VERY flimsy. Don't plan on moving it around much once you get it set up. I'll let you know how cleaning the habitat goes."
3,I agree,"I agree with the other comments that the tadpole experience was not the best. I had no problem receiving 'Mr. Hopperdoodle'from the tadpool farm. I was relieved when our tadpole died because I did not realize that we were not able to release our frog into the wild after he was grown, and did not want to feed it flies. However my daughter loves catching frogs and all other small animals. This is fun place to observe them for a few days and then set them free. I agree that it could have been sturdier, but so far, I have not had any damage to it."
2,We're still waiting...,"This was given to my son as a Christmas gift. We sent the card and $$ for 2 tadpoles, understanding that we'd have to wait for temperatures to allow delivery. About 7 weeks later the tadpoles arrived. We've followed the instructions very carefully. One tadpole began to change, and suddenly died. The second tadpole has not changed one bit. It's now been with us for 3 solid months and still no frog. My son has lost interest, and I'm tired of changing water for our never-changing tadpole!"
3,tadpole,"I bought this item for my four year old. It was relatively inexpensive and seemed like a good idea to teach her about living organisms. The habitat is nice, and relatively well built. I had read many of the reviews online, so I decided to just get a tadpole at the pet store. It never ate the food I bought for it, so it died. I also think when you choose to have a pet that lives and depends on water, you have to be very diligent. The water started to smell, so I changed it. I was very careful and the tadpole survived for a couple days after, but I could not imagine having to do that for months. I have a betta fish (over 2 years now), that I have no problems with, but I am told they are very hearty."
5,Nice Container,I read many of the reviews here that complained about how flimsy the container is. It is durable enough for my son. We don't need to move the container and changing the water is not a problem because the directions say you should use a baster and that has worked fine. My son loves it. It's not a heavy duty container by no means but serves its purpose well for my 7 year old.
2,Frog Habitat,The packaging on this product was made of stronger plastic than the toy itself - very flimsy construction. The tadpoles cost an additional $13.99 for two tadpoles. This product does not give consumers much value for their money. My 11-year old daughter cried when she opened this and realized what poor quality the construction was. She would much rather have the Surf Frogs model.
1,this product kills tadpoles and breaks children's hearts,Don't buy this! It's like some kind of tadpole death trap. If you've already bought the product then throw away the instructions that come with it--which are wrong--and look up tadpole caring instructions on the web. You'd probably also better throw away the cheap plastic terrarium and get a better container that will hold some sand for the tadpoles to dig in and some plants to give them oxygen and more water than this container holds.
1,toy buyer,"I received my tadpoles in early April, 2009. They became frogs in July, 2009. This was quite a bit longer than advertised...After becoming frogs however, they required live food. i.e. crickets...This required a trip to Pet Co. However, crickets need their own ecosystyem to live...They all died. The frogs never touched them. I gave them pellets and blood worms...They did not eat that either...The frogs died...This made me sad...I do not recommend this item for children...Get the butterfly cage to teach children about metamorphosis. At least you can set them free..."
1,Don't buy this,"Tadpoles arrived dead. Called and complained, they were supposed to send new ones, 1 year latter we still don't have the replacement tadpoles. This product is a complete waste of your money."
1,Tadpole were dead when we got them,"I ordered this for my son and we were going to use it as part of a home school project. When you get this, it has a postcard included where you pay extra to buy tadpoles. I ordered the tadpoles and they both were dead when we received them. I contacted the company and they told me they would send me and we never received the tadpoles. So I am out the money for this product and the money for the tadpoles. I have 2 under boys, but I will never order this again!!Pro: It does hold waterCons: Cost extra for the tadpolesThe tadpoles were deadNever got the tadpoles"
2,not so great,planet frog is not a good toy our airholes are too big the crickets could get out. it smells bad and its gross it gets dirty too fast and if you order tadpoles from it that takes forever. please do not buy this toy unless you can handle that
2,not worth (...),"Including tax and shipping, the cost was over (...)for a piece of flimsy plastic that cost the manufacturer about $1 to make. Plus there's a separate shipping charge for the tadpole. It's a great concept, but a financial rip off!"
3,Fun but expensive,"The toy received promptly. It looks can make fun but it is too expensive including delivery charge. The instruction might not be adequate. I got tadpoles, and some of them developed to the mature. However, they all died as I didn't know how they could be fed."
3,Planet Frog,"Hello. I recieved this for my 11th birthday. I got my little tadpole and I waited for over 5 months and nothing happened. I call Uncle Milton. They sent me another tadpole. My first tadpole died. My second tadpole turns into a frog, and the next day, it is dead. I got another tadpole and I am still waiting after all these months. I hope something will happen. I do not recconmend this to a friend. A tip is to put a light over the aquariam durring the day!"
1,Buyer Beware!,This company totally ripped me off! They deserve to be taken out of business rather than give them 1 cent! Check it for yourself via the BBB California website.
4,Timex Marathon Watch,"This watch wasn't as blue as the picture on Amazon made it look. Other than that it's a nice looking watch.I didn't read the features list carefully when I bought it and was surprised that the timers are pre-set; you can't set it yourself, you have to pick from their list. Not a huge deal, as the ones available are pretty typical.I also wish it had more than one alarm, but again, this was my fault for not reading through the features more carefully.It's very easy to set and to navigate through the timers, stopwatch and alarm. The light is like all Timex indiglo's, bright and unique.The strap is also unique - hard to desscribe but it's sort of a backwards closure. It takes a little getting used to, and you need to make sure the end doesn't get folded under the rest of the strap.All in all, it's a comfortable, good-looking watch with basic features."
5,Powerful Collection of Short Stories,"Please Tell Me If The Grass is Greener is a small collection of short stories by Joylynn Jossel. Seven unique stories unfold in this collection that takes the reader on a journey through aspects of life that aren't always green, aren't always perfect...or pretty. Prostitution, drugs, depression, suicide, murder, love, lust, and dating are just a few of the aspects that these intriguing stories touch upon.I was totally enthralled by Jossel's stories and her writing. The majority of the stories were not heavy in dialogue, relying on the story's narrator to come across strong in his or her thoughts in the piece. The voices DEFINITELY come across, and bring the reader front and center to some serious issues. There's not one person who will be able to read these stories and not find at least one that will touch them, move them. I would definitely recommend this collection to other readers, and will be on the lookout for other works by Jossel.Reviewed by Shonie"
1,Do not buy books that cost more as kindle editions,I have not read this edition and I won't unless the price on kindle is less than the paperback edition. Please do not buy books available the kindle when they are cheaper as paperbacks. That makes it more expensive for everyone. Not sure why publishers do this. Seems like Penguin makes it a policy.
5,Astonishingly helpful and simple,"This book will change the way you view just about anything, particularly the things that get under your skin. It offers a simple and powerful way to shift those hurtful perspectives into more constructive ways of thinking about things. In other words: You can uncover hidden beliefs and do something about even the most entrenched ones. An empowering approach that can be applied to anything, and offers a profound way to be honest with ourselves. Highly recommended!"
3,Recommended to me by a friend...,"Books by David Richo, Deepak Chopra, Eckhart Tolle, and Wayne Dyer had already helped me past the points that Byron Katie covers. She covers behaviors and what your true motivations are for your actions. Very helpful stuff as I'm always in need of a review. I did pass the book along to a friend and he has found it very helpful in his life."
5,"Helpful, thoughtful, loving",This book helps to solidify Byron Katie's Work more specifically for relationship issues. It is very helpful and I have used its principles very successfully with many of my patients.
4,reading recommendation from Daughter,I read the book upon the recommendation of my daughter. I find the strategy of Ms. Katie to be interesting and probably effective. I do think it would take some practice.
1,sappy & condescending,"I was so excited to get this and then was sorely disappointed when I started listening to it. I found it hard to follow. The wording kind of chased itself. When she used individual examples of cases she was condescending by calling the people ""hon"" and ""sweetheart"".I forced myself to listen to the first CD but I could not listen to the second all the way through."
1,Waste of Money,"This book was an absolute waste of time and money. I found it repetetive and badly written. There are so many other great books on this subject. Try the ""12 Principles of Karma"" for a well written and very enriching experience."
1,I much needed VMU.,"I used to play my Dreamcast all the time. However when I lost my VMU, I though I would never be able to play it again. However when I found this one on amazon. I was quite pleased. I look forward to playing my Dreamcast again in the future. It arrived before the expected date and I look forward to doing business with this seller in the future."
1,A do not buy,"This game caught my attantion only because of the fact that it is like a mini gameboy. I can tell you one thing, this is no where close. None of the games work and the batteys ware out very fast. the worst part is that you can't change the batteys unless you feel like paying about $10.00. If you keep this in the controller the system asumes that you know that the vmu is in and keeps it on. A DO NOT BUY ASSARORY."
5,JVC CD and radio player,I purchased this for my mom. She is very pleased with the quality and sound. My brother installed it without any issues. It was delivered sooner than estimated.
5,The definitive introduction to collecting Navajo Rugs.,"This is an excellent source on how to find, evaluate, buy and care for Navajo Rugs, especially for the new collector. Insight and information on the history, weaving & weaves, tools used and the major periods of design are all outlined in this book along with beautiful color photos. Navajo Rugs is the essential text for anyone interested in this artform."
4,Missing some trademark Crenshaw qualities...,"...but it's still fun. When he's on stage alone with a guitar, you don't get those gorgeous, multi-tracked harmonies that give his already excellent songs such depth. But it's certainly interesting for fans to hear these songs in stripped down versions, sung in a very emotional style that also differs from the ""cooler"" vocal style of the studio creations. You have to be a fan to enjoy this record; if you got steered to this review because you want to try out Crenshaw go either to his first album or his best-of. If you fall in love with those records, you'll eventually want this, but not as a starter."
4,Very good if you don't play sports games,"The vmu is really cool and the mini-games are a great little extra thing to have, but don't save sports games on it. They take up about 2/3 of the space. I highly recommend buying it because of the price ($X) and because it is made by SEGA. If you're into RPG's and fighting games, buy it!!"
4,"its green, so what?","being green didnt make a difference, unless you have a green controller, most people just buy the ones without the screens, but I actually like the little messages,but pac-it wasnt very much fun(a vmu game), get 2-3 of these and you can save over 15 games. they dont break easily, and I havent seen one with a broken screen yet, you can also exchange info with others, and fight other peoples chao, never mind.if you really think about it, this was the ancient version of the wii u, but the wii u wont use button cell batteries will it?"
1,Is this Liszt or Bach ?,"To me this interpretaion of the Hungarian Rhapsodies is like a wonderfull , smooth , relaxing , automatic ,cruisecontroll drive ! It is boring to death ."
4,Get a broad view of the rhapsodies - get a full set,"Individual legendary performances of the Hungarian Rhapsodies abound nowadays (I probably have a dozen golden-age recordings of number 2). But finding a recording that is both complete and reasonably consistent across both the famous and obscure numbers is not easy (Cziffra only plays a selection). I have learned to love many lesser-known rhapsodies from this set, and to me the understated literalness has allowed it to wear well, especially when hearing a number of the pieces at one sitting. Continuous dazzle can also be boring; Campanella prioritizes his climaxes to heighten impact. It is odd that someone selected number 15 to trash; I learned this piece from Percy Grainger's 1922 recording but Campanella beats the pants off him. If you have a full set you enjoy, stick with it. If you don't, you should get to know the rest of these imaginative pieces, and Campanella is a trustworthy guide."
2,Meh,Can't relate to the main character or the creep. Good to fill in time if you're really bored but I don't recommend it.
5,best version for sym 5,"Until I heard Markevitch finish off Symphony 5, I'd been happy with a lot of them. His finale swaggers, dragged out and insolent, until it ends in a flurry of exuberance. It's my all time favorite. I can't go back to the others! The sound in this era was not quite as good and the original release was a little shaky. The performance more than made up for it even then."
2,Poor quality,"The first Kodak Advantix C650 camera I bought did not work out of the box, so Amazon replaced it. The second one I received produced lovely pictures (for about 2 months), but it stopped working in the middle of my Disneyland trip, forcing me to buy one-time-use cameras while there. I have sent the camera in for repair twice and it took 1-2 pictures before ceasing to function again. I lost the cost of the camera, two batteries, the cost of several one-time-use cameras, and the cost of shipping it twice. (I may try sending it one more time in sheer determination to get something for the money I've invested in it.) Although the pictures I took while the camera worked were of fairly high quality and I love the APS film options, this camera itself is of poor quality and it's a good thing it's been discontinued. I'm not likely to buy a Kodak camera again. Buyer beware."
5,Great features for the price!,"I previously owned a Kodak APS camera, which was recently lost, so I decided to purchase another Kodak camera. I am really pleased with it. The red-eye reduction and the date printing on the back of the photo are two of the features that I like best. The zoom is also a good feature to have. I take a lot of pictures of my family at the beach, and the zoom helps me get a closer shot if they are in the water or too far away. It's light weight and very easy to use; in fact, my four year old daughter has even taken some good pictures with it! Overall, the C650 is the perfect point and shoot camera for me!"
2,Kodak C650,"When I bought this camera, I had decided that my bulky, heavy 35 milimeter should be put away for special moments. I needed a camera that was compact, light and easy to pull out of a purse at any given moment and that is exactly what I got when I received this cute little camera. Unfortunately, that didn't last very long. Within one month of ownership, things started going wrong with the camera, the buttons on the top of the camera stopped working and then the memory was lost and an ""E"" started flashing on the LCD panel. It wouldn't forward the film or take a picture. Since it is all self-functioning, I couldn't even manually open the film compartment to take out the roll that was in there. Needless to say, it was useless at this point, so I had to send it back. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,good camera,"I got one of these cameras as a present for my high school graduation, just in time for my senior trip to New York City. It was a great camera that took wonderful pictures; I loved the low-light flash option (when I remembered to use it). Mine was stolen just over a year ago and I've been looking for another but haven't been able to find one until now."
1,Not Happy At All,"Bought moped and shipping was late, that's ok, getting the paper work was slow, that's ok, got the bike, had a few scratches from shipment, that's ok, at 300 miles, changed the oil as prescribed in the owners manuel, at 800 miles, a screw was loose and let gas leak all over, had to tow it, fixed it, 2 days later, a screw came loose again and lost a good bit of oil, now looking at $750 to repair, warranty only 30 days and has been 60 days, so I have a moped thats broke and have to fix for that amount, and that's NOT ok, feel like I bought a piece of junk."
1,Movies better than the book,"Tedious, repetitive, incoherent. Poor writing, editing, and proofreading. A compendium of disparate lecture notes. Yale University Press should be embarrassed. No need to do the reading: watch the movies instead."
5,Great Music Collection,"These violin concertos by Mozart are a pleasure to listen to. I have played them over twenty times, and like the finest wine, they get better with age!!! Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates great music."
3,Not as good as I hoped,"I was dissapointed, especially after reading david Hurwitz's review, of this recording. The playing in General was too harsh for my taste, expecially in the andante of the 3rd concerto, the opening Adagio in the 5th concerto and the entrance of the violin and viola solo in the sinfonia concertante. The recording isn't awful, but Arthur Grumiaux's recording of the violin concertos aren't as good as Itzhak Perlman's recording with James Levine and the Vienna Philharmonic. As for the Sinfonia concertante, I suggest Anne-Sophie Mutter and Bruno Giuranna's recording with Neville Marriner and the Academy of Saint Martin and the Fields. For a better taste of Arthur Grumiaux, his recording of the Mozart String quintets with his ensamble are tighter and has a better Mozartean elegance."
5,"Grumiaux's Vivid, Aristocratic View Of Mozart","These are exceptional recordings of Mozart's violin concertos and other orchestral works performed by Arthur Grumiaux as soloist. He's given strong support from the London orchestras conducted by Sir Colin Davis and Raymond Leppard. Those who prefer a romanticized Mozart may not find these performances to their liking. Grumiaux's playing is noted for its aristocratic temperment and technical polish; hence it is a far cry from either Perlman's or Mutter's dramatic performances. Still, Grumiaux's austere style works; here it is well suited to Mozart's scores. Certainly this is one of the finest recordings of Mozart's violin concertos I have heard."
3,Hey all you suspicious people! Want a good murder mystery?,"This mysterious story is about a weird murder. Why would anyone murder a teacher? In this book you will find out who killed the teacher - so buckle your seatbelts and hold on tight! I will give you one clue: he never was a good teacher. He was mean, rude, and showed no love to his wife. She then cheated on him with the one teacher he hated the most. The worst part about it is that one of Billy&#65533;s (the main character) best friends is on the suspect list. Through the whole entire time it keeps you guessing. So how about you try to put the puzzle together? You have my best wishes."
1,THE WORST TOY OUT THERE,"This toy is very cheaply made, not to mention that the balls don't go through the hoop. You put the ball on the top of the hoop and then push it. It then comes down a sprial slide, and out the bottom. The balls that are attached are ridiculous. I think that a child will want to hit everything with the bat and the golf club, other than the attched balls. As soon as I put this item together, I took it apart and took it right back to the store."
2,Over rated,I purchased this item for my grandson. He liked the basketball part of it but could not understand why the attached balls would not come off. Frustrating. A lot of money for a mere basketball hoop and a couple of balls with clubs.
2,Pretty Boring.......,My son got this as a gift for his 1st birthday but we didn't put it together till he was 18 months. It is a total bear to assemble...tons of screws in hard to reach places and plasic peices that are hard to snap together. The end result really isn't worth it anyway. My son had little interest in it and mostly took to hitting other toys with the bat and golf club. Spend your money elsewhere!
2,This toy was a big mistake,"It's just not fun for my 2 year old. He got this as a gift when he was 1 and he still isn't interested in it. He's bored with it, actually."
2,Definitely not the greatest,"We received this as a gift for my son's 1st birthday. At first I thought it would be cool since it has multiple sports, but unfortunately we've found it to be pretty worthless. The only thing my son had fun with for a while was putting balls - and other things - in the basketball hoop. If we ever can't find something, we can usually look in there and it's wedged in halfway down. The design of the spinning balls isn't done very well since by the time a child is old enough to have the dexterity to do it, s/he is probably too tall for the baseball and the golf ball one isn't close enough to the ground. Basically, all the bat and golf club seem to be good for are hitting things that aren't supposed to be hit. We've had this for 5 months now and I wish we had returned it and got something else."
1,Confussing toy,"At first my 11 month old liked it. He was curious and wanted to see how it worked. However after the first few minuted he was very bored of it. I believe it is to old for younger toddlers. Seeing how my 11 month old did not like it, I thought my 2 year old would. Wrong! All he did was get in trouble for hitting things in the house with the bat. The place that you are suppossed to hit the ball does not work well. As well as the golfing part of it. You hit the ball and it barely moves (and my 2 year old has a pretty good arm). We had the toy out for 2 days and it got put away!"
3,"Skip this, go just for a basketball hoop","My 15 month year old got this toy for his first birthday. He likes putting balls down the basket (they don't pass through a net, they go down a spiral to the base). He likes the sound of the ball going down. However, he puts everything else down this too (blocks, animals, etc). He doesn't play with the golf club or bat much as he doesn't yet get concept. He might like it more when he is a bit older, but by then the basketball hoop will be old hat. I would recommend skipping this and just getting the single Little Tikes Basketball hoop instead."
4,Versatile and Well Loved Toy,I bought this for my nephew for his second Christmas when he was 1 1/2 years old. He loves playing with the balls but did take a much longer time to really get the gist of the golf club or bat.It was a little annoying to put together so I suggest putting it together first and putting it in a different box for patience sake.Adults can also play with this toy with the children which makes it doubly fun. I truly enjoyed watching my nephew make the connection between where the balls went in and out and what he could do with the other equipment. A really good purchase.
5,Great Toy!!,"My 11 month old son loves this toy!! He got it for Easter when he was 9 months old from his grandparents. I thought at the time he would be too young for it but he would like it when he got a little older. Well I was wrong, he has loved it from day one! It is the one toy in our house he never gets bored of. He loves to play with the little balls. He rolls them and chases them all through the house. He also loves the golf club. He always gets it out and drags it with him everywhere. It is really I great toy with many uses. I highly recommend it!"
5,useful,"We all need a good story. We need to people our exposition with the concrete. The listeners are o/k/ with saying, there was this man that... or I am told that ..., knowing that the preacher is using a storehouse of wisdom. Preaching is not about one's own special story, but about clearly and in an entertaining manner telling our shared experience and needs. This type of book is a must for all who preach or speak."
1,Did not meet expectations,"One one of my Specialized road shoes I was able to get the screws barely started; on the other show I failed to get the threads to catch again and again. I compared the included screws to my old Shimano cleats and found the Shimano provided screws were a bit longer - perhaps 2mm.On the shoe that I was able to get the screws started, the piece of metal that the screw pushes against (the piece with two holes in it) cracked as I snugged them down. Once again I compared to my old Shimano cleats and noticed that this company provided a thinner piece of metal.I won't bother trying to save a few bucks by choosing Sunlite next time."
2,I wish we had more albums from the early days,"I agree with the Music Fan from Falls Church, the original Moorings, Nooten and Wolbert lineup was unbeatable."
4,Contains some good info,"Even though this book is more of a textbook, I have really found it pretty useful. I'm going to begin my fifth year of teaching and I have found ideas and strategies that I could use. It has ideas for both lower and upper grades. It is very comprehensive, covering discipline techniques to parent/teacher conferences."
2,repetitive text,"The topics are well researched, but it's overdone. I don't need to know every study ever created about disruptive behavior. I skimmed most of the paragraphs get to the point of a topic."
4,"Highly recommended, you can't go wrong","I picked this up in a used cd store after a trial listen, and wasn't disappointed. I bought it a few years back, and always return to this to listen. I have two of his others, and this is definitely the best. The lyrics are good, the guitar work strong, and some of the songs just resonate with me. Main Street Sky for example, or Friends of a Traveller. The other cuts are good too. For 3.08 plus shipping you can't go wrong. I have played this for other friends, and they have confirmed my judgement that this is one fine cd. I agree with A Music Fan's review; give this a trial listen, then buy it."
4,seems to work,It seems to work had to reapply a few times. I just didn't like the smell of the concentrate. I would bye again.
5,Works as you would expect it too,Does exactly what is says. What else can I say about it 8 more words are required but are not needed for this review.
3,Standard Item,This is a basic black GBC comb - nothing special about the product that one could say. Again it is a standard product.
3,Too many statistics,"I found it interesting but only when I was half way through the book. Too much statistical info which makes you lose interest,i.e. 50% of people did this, 20 out of 30 did that, 40 out of 50 in 4 years did this & kept it off for 3 years, which is 30%,etc., etc. At least the author wasn't trying to push any one diet and talked about several different ones.All in all, there are better books out there."
1,Acclained Bestseller?,"There is nothing new in this text. It is the same old regurgitation of weight loss success stories, that frankly were not very inspiring. It also summarizes weight loss strategies there were very familiar from other texts that were far more credible. It is hard to believe that this text is touted as an acclaimed bestseller."
4,A Very Motivational tape,Brooklynboy's review from January is right on so I will not retype the exact same thoughts since I agree with all of his comments. I will add the tape does not mention the exchange program that is found in the back of the book version. I bought the tape because I am on Weight Watchers now and I enjoy a little extra boost during the workweek - so I am listening to a few good motivational tapes. The author is the reader and I enjoyed listening to her voice. I can pop the tape into the player whenever I am having a tough day on the program and it will give me that little extra support I may need. I enjoyed understanding the how each of the Masters handled their journey differently and how they each have an emergency plan should they see the scale creep up a few pounds. If you are nearing Maintenance on whatever plan you've chosen.... I highly recommend this tape to keep you on track.
4,Encouraging and common sensical,"Love this book as one who has ""dieted"" most of her life. I have again lost a significant amount of weight and can't afford to gain it back for health reasons. I was despairing of my ability to maintain this loss and this book was recommended. I appreciate the positive outlook and the fact that those who have been successful at losing and keeping it off are highlighted. The hints make sense and it is good to know that others have struggled and come to terms with this lifestyle. It is also good to know that most of them are not rigid in their eating habits and that they can deal with a small weight gain by simply being more vigilant or more active. It is actually possible to reverse a gaining trend: how amazing! Good book for those still on the journey to a healthy weight and for those who made it and want to stay there."
4,basic good advice,the best thing about this book is learning once and for all that everyone needs to find their own way to lose weight and keep it off. it's refreshing to read real accounts of real masters of weight loss and it boils down to basic common sense...eat less and move more! what you eat and how you move is up to you and that's the fun part of the book...learning that all the masters found their own way to lose weight and keep it off. empowering and easy to read.
4,Beautiful and Good,"We bought this for my daughter's room last year, it has held up real good! We aboslutely love this vanity table. One fo the drawers is broken and has come out, but my daughter stuffs too much junk in the drawers, so I don't think I can blame the manufacturer for that. It is gorgeous and solid."
3,queen anne style vanity,i recieved this product well beyond the expected delivery date but shipper was nice enough to refund my shipping and responded fairly promptly to my emails. The product its self is pretty sturdy and was pretty easy to put together my only complaint is that the wooden dowels were to skinny for the holes so i would also use wood glue when putting this item together.The wood is like a wheat color and there was a spot that looks like it wasnt painted but its not that noticable. I love the storage/drawers even though it only fits about 3/4 of my make up collection but it fits mac pro pallets perfectly.I will try and post a photo of the product at a later time.
5,Very nice set!,"I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter, she is going to love it! It is a very nice vanity set and should be with her for many years. The color and the painting on the drawers are so feminine, and the place to put your pictures is a great bonus! It was very easy to put together and came packaged very well. There was one problem, the dow rods in it were too small but this was easliy fixed. I am glad I purchased this and highly recommend it as a very nice vanity set."
4,My wife loved it for her birthday,"I found this piece to be much better then some of the reviews I read. It really is a nice piece of furniture for the money.I'l admit, the instructions weren't too clear for mounting the top to the drawers, ot the mirror to the top, but it wasn't too difficult to figure it out.The real problem is... how am I going to top this present when her birthday comes next year?"
4,Visiondecor Vanity,"I am mostly pleased with the product. The response to my inquiries and need for replacement parts was excellent, so their customer service is extremely good. The product itself could be slightly better quality, but it is still very nice."
3,Broken MIRROR!!!!,"I was really excited to get this vanity set as i have a lot of make up over corwding my bathroom. when I opened it the mirror was broken which I am going to have to personally replace because when I contacted Amazon they wanted me to send the whole set back instead of just replacing the mirror. I decided against that because that is more of a hassle than anything. I was also surprised by the size, It was a little decieving. Overall I liked this vanity set."
3,Mirror Broken,"When the vanity arrived at its destination, the box was in very bad condition and the mirror was broken. My son-in-law went to a glass company in their town and had a new mirror put in since it is a Christmas present and there would not be time to return this one and get another. I feel though that the mirror was not protected adequately and the box was not sturdy enough for shipping a mirror. I understand that shipping is hard on things that are breakable, but there are ways of being more careful about the packaging. I feel that I should get some kind of credit from Coaster Home Furnishings because the item was not packaged properly for shipping."
4,Great!,Very nice vanity and the company was responsive and easy. My daughter is thrilled!Easy to assemble also.
4,"Part was broken, not replaced yet","The order was received, mirror broken, attempted to get another one, vendor shipped wrong part, wrong part returned, vendor never shipped correct part, claim made with Amazon, complete refund which was never asked for, vendor wanted product back, then they agreed to recharge it and send mirror which hasn't been received couple months later. Not a good result so far."
1,disappointing,"This product came missing hardware and damaged with a broken mirror. The vanity table has a cheap appearance, but would be suitable for a younger child at a lower price. Upon emailing the customer service department, I discovered a refund was not an option. To package the entire set back up to send back for replacements was too much of a hassle, so I will probably try to salvage what I can and possibly give to a girl in the preteen age group."
1,microwave and hair !!!!! yukkkkkkk,I would never put something that I used on my hair into N APPLIANCE THAT I PUT FOOD IN...yUKKKKK FACTOR............tHERE IS ALWAYS HAIR LEFT ON CURLERS WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO DO THIS.........
5,Great markers,I used these markers for dying silk and they worked great! I received a single marker instead of the pack and when I let you know they were immediately sent. Thanks for your great service.
5,Good markers.,"These markers are what you would expect from Sharpie. Mine were fresh and in good condition. If you use these very much, you'll save some money by buying them in bulk like this, as opposed to buying them individually at the store for $2.00 a piece."
3,Too far for normal use,"Buying these chisel-top Sharpie markers once was enough. They're useful only on really large items, as they forge thick --- not fine --- lines.Unless you need large, hardware-scale pens, to mark huge boards or big items, stick with fine-point Sharpie pens. Or at least, dual-use pens, with fine AND thick points available, depending on how you hold them.Just my two cents."
1,Not what is pictured.,"I thought the markers would be in the box as shown. Nope. The came in a very flimsy, clear plastic bag. I wanted the box because these are going in my toolbox for work and I need to keep it fairly organized so I can find what I need efficiently. I had to return these and ended up just going to the local office supply store and bought the one in the box for less than I paid here. What a waste of time. I also bought other items there that still hadn't been shipped by Amazon yet and cancelled that order. I will never buy from this site again."
1,I found sharpie cap defective,"I worked with a batch of the black sharpie chisel markers and hate them. The sharpie cap has two parts. When you pull the cap off, an inner cap (which keeps the tip moist) tends to stick on the tip of the marker and has to be removed and replaced or shoved back into the cap before the cap goes back on. A bad product because it is not user friendly."
2,Hitler's Mountain Troops,This book gives a very detailed account of the German Army's Mountain Troops during the 2nd World War. Although well researched and very detailed the books lacks a certain amount of excitement that one would normally associate with a title such as this.In addition topics such as selection criteria and training are not well covered which for a book on special forces is a bit disappointing.
2,Kind of boring,"I got this toy as a ""freebie"" Christmas of '07 from Amazon for buying another toy. I figured what the heck....it's free. I see it's selling for $15.00 at this time. My two boys (3 and 4 at the time) played with it for about 5 minutes and never hardly touched it again. I couldn't say if it's really durable or not, unless you count the endless times it's been thrown in and out of the toybox and hasn't broken. :) They are just bored with it."
3,An Incredible Journey to Heath!,"Author Jordan Rubin, N.M.D., C.N.C., survived terminal Crohn's disease. His personal story of his relentless battle with an incurable disease in conjunction with his strength, courage and determination not to ""give in to the disease"" makes this story one that anyone who has loved someone who is terminally ill or one who is sick to learn how to not give up faith. His experience with alternative medicine and the cure that he eventually discovered within the text of the Holy Bible gives hope to everyone with an incurable disease."
2,not for everyone,"like the successor to this book ""the maker's diet"" this book assumes everyone has the same biological issues as the author. Mercola's book is better."
2,Unsubstantited claims,"This book makes a lot of claims including labeling the author with certain credentials he really doesn't have. Before you buy this book google the author and read the ""Quackwatch"" that notes the FDA has ordered the author to stop claiming that his company, Garden of Life, is making regarding how wonderful his products are. ""Quackwatch"", also, reviews his credentials which are from non accredited schools.However, Rubin does make some good points. You, however, MUST, ferret out what is a real claim and what is not. In addition, please realize that many other companies make the same or similar products, a lot of them much cheaper."
4,Hope the info in this book is working like what it said,"Lots of good information in the first half of the book, but the second half is what an average person will take in more, and less boring. The second half is more less what I wanted to find out from this book, diet, and more diet, what to eat and not to eat. Over all, it's worth a reading."
4,educational,I have read many of Jordan Rubin's books and wondered if I would find new and helpful information in this one; I am learning new facts concerning my health and immune system and believe this book is beneficial. I do wish that Dr. Rubin would not reference his own products so much but do believe that Garden of Life is a trustworthy company and I do purchase some of these supplements. A good resource for all who struggle with health issues and are looking for answers from scripture as this is based on the Bible.
1,What a rip off!,"Good thing I received this book for free. It was too wordy and wasn't well written. For example, under mental disorders the author forgot to define Schizophrenia as he did with the other disorders - looks sloppy. Also, the protocols for illnesses were nearly all the same; this book could have been 1/3 the size. It started off with SOME good information, although nothing new, and had a nice personal success story. Soon after that you get slapped in the face with its sales gimmick, which is difficult to get past. Why? Because it's difficult to trust informtion coming from a person who is going to benefit financially from his recommendations - 100% of the recommended supplements are from his company. As a previous reviewer wrote, why didn't Rubin give us the products he used to recover - those before he created his own? Rubin's focus on sales is too strong which makes it difficult to trust his recommendations."
2,Patient Heal Thyself,Sent it back as I had to much to read.Wanted to finish reading all the book I had first then one day I will see how it goes.Zoe
2,The truth is ?,"I remember seeing the same person, same photographrecommending a SBO product from a company calledLifeScience, and now he is also recommending anothercompany product PrimalDefence!! Which one really workedJordan??"
1,Patient Watch Thy Wallet,"This book was a very VERY thinly veiled sales pitch for ""Dr."" Rubin's nutritionals, which he claims ""cured"" his Crohn's disease. He shows no medical evidence that his Crohn's, or anyone else's, was cured using his questionable methods. The book recommends odd nutritional practices, which might not cause a healthy body any harm, but which could potentially really hurt someone with a weakened immune system. My favorite: taking capsules of Rubin's proprietary formula ""Beneficial Soil Organisms."" What that means in English, folks, is ""Germs We Found in The Dirt."" Caveat patient."
5,Good Combo Book with...,"...""Restoring Your Digestive Health"" also by Jordan Rubin. This book lays out how certain products of his Garden of Life line were developed, why they were created, and how and when to use them. Unfortunately it is a bit out of date as more products have been developed since then ~ but it's still a good foundation read."
5,this book delivers,An outstanding read of one man's determination to reject the allopathic medical system and find health through natural healing. I hope to be able to use his ideas with my own health problems.
3,Abnormal Psychology 101,"Chuck Palahniuk crafts another absurdist tale about characters on misadventures against normalcy. His goal: to rock you, to unsettle your cozy vision of society. What's Palahniuk trying to say as he throws Victor into restaurants with the intent to dupe good samaritans into believing they have saved him from choking?Victor is choking, really.Stuck in the pattern of addictions he wishes to eject out of himself once and for all. Choking on the memories of his dysfunctional upbringing, all interspersed in flashback throughout the narrative, lodged in between the chapters like undigested food, chunks of thought his whole being revolts against.The movie directed by Clark Gregg adheres closely enough to this book for you to get a sense of it. And while I enjoyed banging into the pages, I reserve five stars for the books I will revisit, the books that I want a long term relationship with."
3,What a great cover for a book!,"Oh yeah...the inside is really good too.Vic is a nutcase sex addict. You don't have to be a nutcase to be a sex addict, but he pulls it all off pretty well. He's a player in a Civil War reenactment troup and a med school drop out. But once in awhile he meets other sex addicted females for a little give and take. When he's not doing these things, he's faking choking to death in various eating establishments to get a little attention. As a result of his exploits, the people who end up saving him are somehow duty-bound to send him money every month in probably the most unrealistic and impossible to believe side points of the book.Aside from that, Chucky has put together a thoroughly readable piece that has some really nice subplots and the occasional twists and turns. I liked it a lot and if you're a fan of the writer, you will like this book better than most of his others."
5,Great Book,This is one of Palahnuik's finest and in my opinion best since Fight Club. I would deffinately reccomend this to anyone who is a fan of great satire.
5,No one writes losers like Palahniuk,"ChokeAnd since Palahniuk is notorious for living the life before he writes it down, I can only imagine... His characters are losers you still end up cheering for and love to hate to love. Twisted and strange, his motley crew of characters."
4,Palahniuk shakes all of us!!!,"Palahniuk has realized the will of to be addicted something in the deepest dark place of human beings. The whole life made up by nothingness which has no meaning except the interpretations of intellect minds. Everything is a fiction which can be imagined differently by any mind who has an intellectual capacity. And every single individual has different dependencies with the earth. These dependencies construct the imagines of world.The mother of the hero says ""now you have seen the real mountain for the first time"". This was the one of the most important messages of the book. Leaving all dependences behind brings the real world to the individual... The whole world is, what it is, and nothing else but the imaginations of minds.A very well written book..."
5,hell yeah,"Okay first off Chuck rocks. He is one of the best new writters out there. I read choke about a year ago since then I've read the book about three more times. It is the best book I have ever picked up. Once you read the first page you won't put it down till its done. Lots of people have read chucks other books before this but this was my first and fav. I do also have all his other books which are all very good ; Invisable Monsters, Fight Club, Survivor, Lulaby and Choke. I hope this review helped you in deciding wrather or not you buy this book. I say buy it then buy another for your firend/s its a classic and a must have even if you never read."
3,Ho-Hum,"I was a bit let down with this one after reading 3 of his other books. I kept waiting for some big climactic weird moment and when it came it was just ho-hum for me. It was a good read, but I was hoping it was going to wow me like his other books I've read."
4,A great book,"This was the first Chuck Palahniuk book that I've read, and I loved it. I would give it 4 and a half if I could. The description of the hospital and the people in it was amazing. My only problem with the book was that things were introduced and not explained until later in the book, and it caused a little confusion. But then again, sometimes when that happened, it enhanced the story. Pick this one up, as long as sexual situations and cursing don't bother you."
3,Loved it,"In short this is a very well written book with a very unique and refreshing spin on society. For anyone who ever wakes up in the morning, looks around and says "" When did the world get so crazy?"" this is a book for you."
2,Well at least he warns you from the beginning,"I have read all of Palahniuk's novels and liked each and every one of them,...except ""Choke."" I don't know if it's the mostly unexplored story of how the main character makes his cash which is even unbelieveable for a Palahniuk story, or how he seems to just poorly rehash stuff from his previous books. (The sex addict clinc is straight up ""Fight Club"" while the medical stuff is ""Invisible Monsters."") But I think what makes this book not recommendable is how the book just seems rushed at the end. Too many storylines that read as if they were forced to come together.His other books are much better. Read ""Fight Club,"" ""Survivor,"" ""Invisible Monsters,"" and ""Lullaby."" Those are the books that make you want to read more.To Chuck's credit, he does tell you at the beginning that you're not going to like him; and he's right."
3,pajsfasjdasudas!!!!,"Tried to think of one word to sum this book up, and I couldn't. My rankings for his 4 books go like this: 1. Survivor 2. Fight Club 3 Invisible Monsters 4 Choke. Not to say choke is the worst, because I'll take Choke over a bunch of the [crud] that is out there today. I just wasn't drawn in as much as I was the other stories. As it was with his other books, I love the style in which he writes, but after 150 pages or so, you hit that HUH????!?!?! point. And typically with about 20 pages to go a bombshell is dropped. Another is dropped with about 5 pages to go. Does it all work? Yes. Is it fresh and unique, maybe. The sex addict scenes are very amusing, as are the colonial towns as well. At some point though, I'm wondering when Chuck will take a different approach that is not in the things must get worse before they can get better mode. All in all though, I found this book to be entertaining and a quick read. Now have to wait until the next one comes out."
2,Found it as a bore,"I read the first 4 chapters, i told myself this book will be good, but i just could not finish it, it never picked up. Im glad i got the book for free. There is too much hype about this book, I would rent it from a library or borrow it from a friend first. Again I need to say, this book is a bore and does not pick up."
4,Beyond Fascination,"This book, simply put, is beyond fascinating... have you any wit or disdain for the reality around us you would instantaneously fall for this book as well as the writer. I mean, come on, who doesn't want to read a book where he pretends to choke on food in order to have people save his life, as well as work a far-less that mediocre job in a colonial town... oh and go to sex a holic meetings... get over it this book rocks."
2,I can't say I wasn't warned,"When I pick out a book, I don't read the back. I read the first couple of pages to see if I like the writing style.I should have been paying more attention to the words. He came right out on page one and told me I wouldn't like this book and I took it as a dare more than a warning. Should have read the warning.The writing style kept me turning pages but I was uncomfortable with the subject matter. The vulgarity of the main character's sexual addiction, the sheer lunacy of every other character and something about the casts struggle with starvation made me feel like the book was my own manic episode.This book marks the closest I've ever come to not finishing a novel. It would take a lot to make me pick up another of Chuck's books."
5,How could you not enjoy this book?,"Okay, I will admit that I've not come across a book by Chuck Palahniuk that I don't like. I first visited Fight Club because of the movie - and moved into the realm of Lullaby - Choke I picked up at an airport bookstore in September. This book caught my attention from the start (as they always do) and sucked me in.I think what I appreciate the most about this and Palahniuk's other books is that they meld with the ADHD mindset of our generation - and change tracks faster than I change boyfriends.This is just straight-up good stuff - how can you not fall in love and hate the character who is consciously making money and boosting people's self-esteem at the same time -- how could you possibly not love that?!?!?!"
1,I want my money back.,"I was a huge fan of Chuck after reading Fight Club, Invisible Monster, and Survivor. After trying to read Choke, I dropped Chuck. There was a flare to his writing with the subtle gross out factor and extreme story lines, but Choke was just stupid. I couldn't even finish reading the book (I have read the previous three mentioned numerous times). There is only so much I can stand of reading about snot. I haven't read any of his other books since Choke because I was so disappointed. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE FIRST THREE THOUGH."
2,"All style, no substance.","This book stunk. The author's books have always been populated with blank characters for whom the reader never feels a thing (they exist only to advance his criticism of society), but this one is so empty it's like a black hole. After reading Diary and Survivor, I realize Palahniuk's books are less novels than they are almanacs, collections of random facts, albeit interesting facts. It's like he's read every urban legend story in the world and just vomits up tidbits onto blank paper and then connects them with cardboard characters. I think most people read his books for the reason I've lasted this long: the packaging is awesome. All of his books have awesome covers, and you'll feel better when you realize that's why you and others are buying them too."
1,I don't know why I even bothered,I don't normally read novels. I picked this one up in order to enthuse me back into reading novels. What a total put-off this was? Could not keep myself interested beyond the first ninety pages. The characters are hazy and there's no plot. The rule of adding a touch of sex to anything to make it work does not cut it with this novel. This book is going straight to the bin!
2,Not worth finishing,"It started out interesting so I kept on reading it. I noticed the book had no point or anything interesting, but I thought since every talks about how great Chuck Palahniuk's book are. Towards the end the was so bad and weird I just stopped reading it."
1,disappointed,"I do really like the book, actually I mean the content of it, but the quality of the book is bad, very very bad, it's the book from museums. moreover, the appearance of it is bad and unacceptable. the picture on the website is not the real photos, since there is also a tag from the museum on the cover. how can i store this book. It's a really bad experience of buying things on amazon. Hope it's the only one. Jesus!"
2,Definitely not for everyone..,"This book is definitely not for everyone to read. It is very perverted and just wrong in so many ways. I couldn't even finish reading this book. I guess it just rubbed me the wrong way. I'm really not into the dark and perverted stuff that was in this book. If you are into stuff like this, I highly recommend it to you."
1,Book Sucks Palahniuk was trying too hard,Awful I threw it in the trash after reading it halfway. Palahniuk was trying too hard to be edgy and sarcastic it just comes out very lame.
1,obscenity a ruse to disguise emptiness,"This book was recommended to me by a friend who related a story about a reading by Palahniuk, complete with fainting old ladies and styrofoam body parts that Palahniuk threw into the audience. ""If you read anything,"" he said, ""read Choke."" Now I fear the taste of my friend is in serious question. Chuck uses lots of colorful metaphors for various sexual acts and the more relevant parts of his body, but his imagination appears to have abandoned him after that. The print was big, the sentences bland and uncomplicated, and he's cheekily prone to repeating choice phrases that are as bland or moreso than rest.It was somewhat reminiscent for me of highschool, if you can imagine being accosted by a group of horny, unintelligent and loud mouthed lacrosse players. Anyhow, I'm glad those days are over, and the metaphors really weren't all that clever. I don't have anything against sex or books about sex, but I like it with a little content. Don't bother."
2,how did this book get pubished again?,"...I didnt like the book ""Choke"" at all. I thought the few characters were degraded and I dont know why any normal person would want to go into the mind of a sex-adict. I thought the characters were undeveloped and vague in my immagination due to the lack of description, as well as primitive in their attitude towards each other as well as sex. If you really read into it, Victor (main character) has a one track mind- sex, and ocasinoally his poor dying mother.....this book was just unenjoyable, unless of course, you would want to spend 200 pages of your time reading about a gutter minded 20 some odd year old kid who is going through all of the sexual desires that any normal human goes through, only he gives into them...I really cant belive this book even got published, what a gross reflection of American culture!"
1,Fly Paper,"I've said it once and I'll say it again: I do not enjoy reading fly paper. Since Fight Club, Chuck's artistic integrity has taken a pretty hard blow--it's on the ground for the count and nearing its last breath. ""Cohesive"" and ""coherent"" are no longer in the guy's vocabulary. With this knock out, I'd say Palahniuk is strong evidence that Zoloft causes mental retardation."
2,"Never comes together, not one character is at all likable (or terribly interesting)","I'll sum up my thoughts like this:in the annals of med school, I'd hazard a guess that noone who ever got in ever used the phrase ""for serious"" when they meant ""seriously"" or ""for real."" This phrase stopped me dead in my tracks every time Victor used it, and it seemed stupid.Plus, every guy gets sexually rejected once in their lives by a woman ... except Victor.This is a slightly below-average throwaway novel. Meh."
4,Must Have!,"I was recently introduced to Chuck Palahniuk's work by a friend and I must say.....I have a very good friend now. This book was great! The book did have a slow introduction to the characters but Chuck thew in just the right amount of laugh out loud humor to keep you pressing on. Before you get half way through the book you feel like you personally know these characters in the book. (I swear to god Denny's character was based on an old buddy of mine!) Although the twist at the end wasn't a FIGHT CLUB twist, it was still good. If your into crazy, demented characters with a story line that only gets better by the page, I would suggest this book. As for me, I'm moving onto another Palahniuk book."
5,The best new writer of our generation,"I've read all of CP's books (except Lullaby...yet) and I find him amazingly original. In a nutshell, this is a fantastic read. It's a little bizarre (not a bad thing), but I wouldn't recommend it if you're a first time CP reader. I'd say read ""Fight Club"" first. Book sheds interesting light on maternity and humility."
3,Interesting.,"I had high expectations for this book after reading and seeing Fight Club. It has a great twist in the end, but between the pages the story seemed drawn out and I eventually became bored of the stories on masturbation and sex. It wasn't a waste of time, but I probably won't read it again."
3,"funny, quick, kinda sick","This is a very quick read. If you spend more than two days on it, I'd be surprised. The pace of this story makes it easy to consume, and like a thick chocolate milkshake, you'll be loving it while it's going down, then feel maybe a little yucky the next day. The characters are fascinating because you wonder if such people really exist or if they are just semi-monsters created in Palahiuk's mind. One thing about Palahniuk, his characters are consistent, so a creep is a creep throughout. There is a shot at some redemption/healing stuff going on here at the end, with one of the characters, an ex-sex addict who collected a large rock each day he didn't jerk off, that seems perhaps a touch out of place, but is necessary for Palahniuk to tie together the threads of his ideas. Not a ""deep"" book per se, fun to read and thought-provoking in some respects. Quick and (relatively) painless."
1,Weird,Not sure why everyone liked this book. I could barely read it be/c it was so weird and yet boring. There was no life to the book the character was so gray and dry. Don't waste your time.
3,A GUY BOOK - and nothing wrong with that,"I'm going to keep this review short and simple. My guy friend recommended it to me because he said it was the best book he ever read, after Fight Club. As a teenage girl, however, it was very difficult to get through this book. Don't get me wrong - Palahniuk is one of the most unique and innovative writers of our time. However, unless you are an adolescent guy, this book will most likely be extremely hard to bear. The humor, style, and subject matter I cannot relate too, thus turning me off to any sort of plot that existed. THIS IS A GUY BOOK. The one book I would recommend of Palahniuk's that girls can also enjoy because of its deeper, more existential themes is Fight Club."
1,Not a book to get stranded on a desert island with,"I've been saving up CHOKE for months for a needy moment, which came this morning when I expected to be spending a couple of hours in a doctor's waiting room. After plowing through fifty pages, however, I decided it would be more fun to just stare at the walls, which is what I did. It's an ugly book about the sort of people you'd cross the street to avoid if you saw them coming in time. Maybe it gets better. I don't intend to find out."
1,Choke by Chuck Palahnuik,"Chief Justice Brennan in 1957 described this book when he wrote the Roth decision and defined obscenity. When a work is utterly without redeeming social importance and when for the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest, it is obscene. This book about a sex addict is marked by an immoderate and/or unwholesome interest in unusual sexual desire: the very definition of prurient. Choke could be subtitled: ' A Dictionary of Genitalia and Sexual Intercourse to Debase the Human Body and the Sex Act.'"
5,Pulled back in,"If it wasnt for choke, I would not be reading today. Chuck has single handily opened me up to a world of authors who don't write conventional stories. If you are looking for something that isn't quite the norm, then this is it."
2,"Not all that, is the first word that comes to mind; see O.K.","This story was alright I thought it would be better because of Fight club. I liked where it seems like he was trying to go with the story but it didnt catch me Like I wanted it too. Others may love it, but I thought it was O.K. Only."
3,Could've been a lot better.,"I have read all of Palahniuk's previous books and was looking forward to the release of Choke. However, I was a little disappointed when I read it. Is worth the read but definitely not one of his best books. Hopefully the next one will be better."
1,the cover is the best part,I read the first half. skimmed actually. then I superspeed skimmed the rest. I'm sure I missed the good page.
5,a book for those with potential,"first of all let me say that the satire and the provocative style in which chuck writes is simply amazing. if you want a books that you can apply to life and change your life for the better chuck's books are where its at. i give this 5 stars because, frankly, this is better than the bible. You cant read this and say it isnt a work of art. me and my friends base a lot of lives around fight club, the idea that the world we see isnt exactly the world we live in. i couldnt see giving this book with the same aspects it shares with fight club anything less than a four star rating, and if anyone does i say to them write something as profound as this work and let me read. i can be almost certain it wont be as profound as the works of palahniuk."
2,Fading Talent,"While ""Fight Club"" showed virtuoso prose and original ideas, and ""Survivor"" expanded his mileau of the dispossesed, ""Choke"" fails on every level. The main character is a rehash of Palahniuk's bizarro character sketches. Also, the story does not have the narrative drive contained in his other novels. Finally, and most disturbing, is the fact that the writing style is just plain bad, being juvenile and unoriginal. Chuck, what's up??"
5,Hilarious,"This book is the best dark comedy I've read. Choke is about a sexaholic who pretends to choke on food at different restaurants every night to pay for his mom's medical bills. Chuck Palahnuik makes fun of senior citizens, sexaholics, and life in general. I would encourage everyone to read this book 10 times."
4,Wierdness Can be a Good Thing,"This is the second Palahniuk book I have read, and I am amazed at the way this man's mind works. I often found myself having to close the book and just find something else to do while I pondered the ins and outs of these very strange people Chuck Palahniuk invents.I would have given this book 5 stars, but I read Invisible Monsters first, and I don't think any other book can compare. Chuck Palahniuk is amazing, and I so recommend this book."
3,meh.,"This was my third Chuck book and I have to admit I was a little disappointed. Or a lot. I was never completely engaged in the story - I couldn't get hooked. Therefore it took me a lot longer than usual to finish the book. I'm a fan of addictions but the whole sexaholics thing never really worked for me. And getting anal beads stuck up your ass, well, I just saw that as kind of gross and unappealing. It could have been funny but it really wasn't. I enjoyed the very end of the book and the message that came across - but that was about the last three pages. It just wasn't up to par with his other works.I've read both ""Diary"" and ""Survivor"" and loved them, so I wouldn't start your Palahniuk reading with ""Choke""."
5,not for the faint of heart,"The only problem any reader seems to have with this book is that it's ""gross"". And really, that's the only problem you could have. If you tend to avoid the grittier thoughts that we all have, and focus only on the pretty side of your mind this is not the book, or the author for you. CP uses disturbing description of sex, biology, and alimentary function as a tool to make the reader see that the main character lives in a world that we avoid.yes, it's wierd. Yes, it's graphic. even so, I dare you (as does CP, on the first page) to put it down. It's worth every churn of the stomach just for the twist at the end."
4,Choke,"I thought this book was great, but after reading Chuck's other recent work I am begining to expect this level of straight forward social satiare. If you are always asking why, to social problems that no one seems to see or care about you will love Choke. Choke and Fight Club are perfect examples of what happens when one has hade enough, but is talented enough to get those in the mainstream and those just below the mainstream to listen. If you are searching for a book with as bold of a message, but speaks to the twenty something crowd or want to better understand the twenty something crowd then try Glorious Failure by Ben Jonjak"
1,Nasty isn't the right word,"but it's the first word that comes to mind. I'd like to ""choke"" the woman from my book club who suggested this book. Club met last night and not one woman liked this book. Some couldn't even finish reading it because they were so disturbed they lost sleep. I truly regret that there's a record on the world wide web that I even purchased this smut."
5,Choke,"First book by Chuck Palahniuk I've ever read, and I couldn't put out down. I recommend it for any and everyone."
5,I enjoyed this more than Fight Club,"For my money this book had it all and I really enjoyed it. I rank this above Fight Club without hesitation. If you like Chuck and don't have it, get it."
4,AWESOME MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT WORD........,but it's the first the comes to mind.Really enjoyed this book. Anyone under 30 will also love it too.
3,Interesting...,"I liked this book, it was interesting, twisted, and different. I did not like it as much as Survivor though, but enough to buy another of his books. Choke leads you on a path that you assume is going somewhere, and although it has many surprises, it fails to make any ultimate point.I'd buy it again."
3,I was expecting more.,"I'm half way though and I'm just not feeling this Palahnuik guy yet.He's supposed to be freaking epic and amazing, but I'm just... Not seeing it yet."
2,Smells like Fight Club,"My overwhelming wish was that the title character would have actually choked on the first page and no one saved him. That would have perhaps made for an interesting read. There were two redeeming qualities to the audio book: 1) it was just over 5 hours long, and 2)the narrarator wasn't terrible. Outside of that, there is little to be excited about here. The characters are almost as unbelievable as the preposterous, meandering plotline of this jumbled mess. All the tricks of the trade are here: allegory, alliteration, emphatic repetition. None of it works. It rings as hollow as an undergrad emulating his favorite author, and falling woefully short. This is my first go round with a Palahniuk book (Fight Club was the second one I read, but these could be gene-spliced together without any rejection by the host....they feel that similar, thus the copy & paste review similarities). There are too many good reads out there to waste one of the finite ones you have left on this drivel."
3,Like choking on junk food,"Palahniuk is an extremely talented writer. And I'll admit, I laughed out loud several times. It was a fun read, which is almost enough to recommend it. But in the end, it feels like so many empty calories. There's just no depth here. And the ending seemed thrown together at the last minute. But I guess if you're looking for something light and entertaining, you could do a lot worse."
3,It Was Ok...,"I agree with the other reviews-if you are disgusted by vivid and dirty sex, poop, snot, bodily fluids of all sorts, old people and monkeys, this book probably isn't for you. If you can deal, you will only be rewarded with a mediocre story at best. The whole novel feels like it is jammed with needless uncomfortable descriptions for the sake of making people uncomfortable. If creating a sense of unease helped move the story along, I would be fine with the device...but it didn't help an already weak story. Parts of the novel would have made great short stories, but as a whole it just wasn't strong enough to make me feel anything. And I'm sorry, but if I read ""but it's the first thing that comes to mind"" again, I thought I was going to start screaming. That was worse torture than the monkey and the chestnuts description."
4,Recommended Read,"I highly recommend this book as an individual work very distinct to Chuck Plahniuk's style, and an overall enjoyable experience. I laughed aloud repeatedly while reading this book and I spent a lot of time thinking about it when I was finished. This will probably be a movie some day so I suggest you read it before it does, that way you can brag to everybody about how you read it before it was popular."
2,Don't buy it.,"Unless you're a huge fan of Palahniuk, stay away from this book. If you're just getting into him I highly recommend ""Haunted"" or ""Fight Club"" over this."
2,What would Jesus NOT do?,"He would not read this book... I've enjoyed every Palahniuk's creations, but this is not good at all. It's in the same Palahniuk-Fight Club style, but it lacks an entertaining story. It is very raunchy, dicey, and weird like Palahniuk's great novels, but it lacks entertainment value. You read chapters after chapter before anything happens. I will say that the end is rather intresting. But to get to that point, it takes so much energy to pick up the book and plow through. What would Jesus NOT do? I know Chuck-- he would not read this novel. At least Palahniuk has Fight Club behind his name."
2,He really did choke.,Let me start by saying I like Chuck's work. I thought fight club and survivor were very good but this one was substandard. Like alot of his work the characters are one dimensional and that is ok if the action of the plot moves fast enough but sadly this is not the case. None of these characters (except Denny)are sympathetic and I did not connect with any of them. I was struck by how masoginistic our antihero Victor is. As with other of his books chuck uses the protagonist to spout slogans but there were few that we could hold on to. i recomend this book only to those devotees of Chucky P's work who worship him or those who are between the ages of 17-19 They'll like it.
1,Pure Drivel,"Palahniuk's ""Choke"" is, in a word, drivel. Like all other shallow, immature offerings from Chuck Palahniuk, this one shines with the author's fascination for his own amateurish writing. It's awful."
2,SUB PAR,"I forget how i came across this book, maybe it had to do with fight club, a great film. i never read the book. anyway, about the book. it jumps around way too much. the beginning was a chore to read and get used to. i dont see what all the hoopla is about with this, it really isnt anything great. there are some original ideas in it, that are weird. Chuck writes some interesting sentences, some good descriptions, but i didnt find the plot very satisfying. its just okay, nothing great. oh well, hope this helped."
1,"Choke....Gag....it's not the right word, but the first word to come to mind...","I picked up the book choke because my significant other is absolutely obsessed with Palahniuk and i've read a couple of his works before. Unfortunately this book was just a major upset. At first I found the book rather interesting, but there were parts where it just dragged on and on and on. The flashbacks lessend the pain, because they were slightly more interesting. But aside from that, the ending of this book was the big upset to me in my opinion. This isn't a very Palahniuk-esque, and i wouldn't recommend reading it , it's the first couple pages that draw you in. And Palahniuk was right, don't keep on reading it, becasue it isn't worth your time..."
1,Such a mean view of the world,I have the good fortune to say that I have never encountered anyone remotely like the people in this novel. I finally concluded that I was just not the target audience for this novel. Some people thought this was funny?! Compulsive sex adicts throbbing lovelessly away on the bathroom floor? Ugh.
5,I LOVED IT!!!!,"Choke was a great novel! This was the first book i read of Chuck Palahniuks. I loved his writing style, ive never read anything like it. It is very fast paced and has you going in a bunch of different directions at once, which i liked alot. I loved the storyline it was very clever, i mean who would think of someone that chokes on food to make someone a hero, pure genius. I would recomend this book to anyone i think everyone would enjoy it tremendously. I'm definitly going to read other Chuck Palahniuk novels."
5,A glimpse into the mind of an addict!,Chuch Palahniuk has captured the true essence of being a sex addict. He accurately describes the mental games and justification of all sexual acting out. What's more he explains how the addict got that way. A true treasure to read.
2,Less Favorable of Chuck P.,"I really enjoyed Palahniuk's first two books, Fight Club and Survivor. His style and cut throat in-your-face narration keeps you propelled to read on. However, Choke does not do that. I could not even finish the book after getting to page 90. For some reason, the narration got very repetitive and annoying. The content is over-the-top gross, and overshadows the characters and story. Chuck's first two books kept a good balance of satire and the explicit to the development of the main characters. Choke read as though the author was trying to out do his other books by being too ridiculous with repulsive language. By the time you read Choke, Chuck is not so much fun or a shock to read. It's just flat out silly. His latest novels tend to go beyond the repulsive language and try to create a different atmosphere with characters."
3,Fun but not filling,"The book was a fun read but leaves little behind when done.The characters, plot and settings are self-consciously ""quirky"" and the themes were all explored elsewhere by him before, and better. The main gag (and title) is interesting, but that is a small nugget of substance to add to so much fluff.A funny thing happened, in that, halfway through the book I remembered I had seen this movie somewhere once. That is how forgettable it is.So, like Chinese food, I am reaching for another book a half hour after this one closes."
3,3.5 stars Drags in the Middle,"Something just missed for me. I read the first 100 pages in one sitting, then I just couldn't seem to get into the story again until around 180 pages. Maybe I lost my momentum, I don't know, but somewhere in the middle of the book I found myself asking: where is he going with this? For the middle third of the book, I just didn't care. It felt lazy, not sloppy, just not edited as precisely as I had expected. The middle section wasn't the tight, fast-paced train ride that Palahniuk is famous for. Then it suddenly picked back up again and the weird just got weirder. He does have a unique way of writing men who appear to be morally bankrupt jerks who turn out to be generally decent guys, but not in a way that is contrived.-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman"
3,"Easy Read, Nothing New","I am a huge fan of Chuck P. But this novel is just like an excercise in everything he has already done.not many new ideas and the hooks and gimmicks he uses are growing slightly old. not terrible or boring, but not even close to great.i thought he'd take more chances but apparently there's not much left in the tank. Chuck's good at what he does, but what he does is getting repetitive.still better than most of the...[stuff] out there. But his worst to this date. at least if you read it last."
5,cool as hell,"Although it borrows some things from Fight Club, Choke is original in it's own right and it easily stands out as one of the best books I have read in a while. It's wierd and disgusting, but cool as hell at the same time. A must read for the open minded individual that is sick of Harry Potter."
5,Loved it!,"This is one of my favorite books, it is dark, strange and extreamly well written. Definitly not for the faint of heart."
4,So funny...,"in such a weird, crazy, strange, perverted kind of way.But then its also kind of sad in a similar kind of way. A really great read, but it does, at least to me, point out a sort of emptiness...a lack of something in the world, to the point that it made me at least feel content that it wasn't just me. Not that I'm sure that what I just said makes sense, but I don't like to edit my thoughts -- but yes, anyway, this is a great book to read over a couple days.Its certainly f-ed up, and it certainly gives you a little bit to think about for a while...before you set it down and get back to yourself."
4,A book for feeling good,"This book is the first of Chuck Pahalniuk's novels I have read. The book was interesting enough that I purchased his new release ""Lullaby"" and ""Survivor"". Choke was nothing like ""Fight Club"" the movie(Haven't read the book yet). It took a little bit of patience to get started but I finished with ease and surprise in the end. Choking to get by in life and trying to find out who you really are."
5,Another great one from Chuck,"Ok, so granted this is isn't as great as Survivor or Invisble Monsters but it's still a good novel. At some points I felt that it was dragging a bit and that it was getting boring, and that rarely happens in Chuck books. And the whole sex part of the plot was just really kind of unnecessary when you think about it. But I still give it a 5 star because it was very entertaining and the climax is hilarious."
3,Get some therapy,"I liked this book enough to finish it, but two things become abundantly clear during the reading: 1) this guy has a problem with women, and 2) this guy has a particular problem with his mother. Those are not, in themselves, bad, it's just that the point is driven home so often that it becomes tiresome. That the mother in the story is referred to as ""the mommy"" served only to annoy me after about the second time. Palahniuk is a funny, talented writer (I love his stories of the twelve step programs), but he relies too heavily on repetition to enlighten his readers. Chuck, get some therapy, and get over yourself!"
5,An excellent novel,"Much better than the Fight Club. A new style, a great writing and a non-conventional story.Don't lose it."
4,"Stop overanalyzing, this book is enjoyable","I have been reading many reviews for this book and I find a common thread in most of the dissatisfied readers: they need a book to seem intellectual and smart for them to read it. Many people are complaining about the writing style being similar to that of a 15 year old. Even if this is true, does it have to distract your attention from the book? I'll admit, this book has questionable narrative, but I still enjoyed it. I don't need to tell my friends I read some over-the-top literary work to be seen as a smart person. I can enjoy any book that has a well thought out plot structure, interesting characters, and a creative writing style. 4 stars."
2,Not good enough,"Took off with FIGHT CLUB. Peaked with SURVIVOR. Fell hard and long with INVISIBLE MONSTERS Barely even gets back on his feet with CHOKE. A disappointment from someone who's proven himself capable of so much more. Empty. Pointless. Unfinished. And, unfortunately, completely redundant. It seems that if you've read one Palahniuk, you've read them all. See also: Gimmicky transitions. See also: Over-stylized sentence fragments. See also: Addiction and disillusionment...there are other things to write about."
3,suspend your disbelief and keep it that way,"Lots of forced symbolism, implausible characters and events- not the author's best effort. Fight Club was grittyin a believable sort of way while this book tries to be so unrealistically ""gritty""that it ends up being ridiculous. The humor was the only thing that made this an okay book."
3,"Good, but not Chuck's best...","Choke tells the story of a guy who is fixated on sex, and his mother. Luckily, this turns out not to be as gross as it sounds.The main character is a recovering sexaholic who works at one of those colonial-era recreations where the workers pretend like they're still living in the 18th century. He is trying to make enough money to get his mother a feeding tube. Needless to say, hilarious hijinks ensue.This book is pretty funny, but doesn't have the deeper meaning that Fight Club had. Its an entertaining read from a very talented author. If you're going to give Palahniuk a try, read Fight Club first. If you like that, then try this one out."
4,Wow.,"What an intense read. I felt completely captured by the plot, and all I could do was hang on for the ride. From the first sentence, Palahnuik throws you into the world and stream of consciousness of Victor, a recovering sex addict who is treading water at Step 4 (reconciliation with past misgivings). Victor is living his convoluted life: working at a colonial ""living"" museum full of addicts, fake choking at restaurants to be saved (in order to, later, ask his ""hero"" for $$$)--all to pay for his mother's stay at a mental hospital.A particularly interesting section of the book: when Victor, convinced he was the second coming of Christ, begins to act according to his new mantra: ""What would Jesus NOT do?""Palahniuk is obviously a very talented writer. His writing flows effortlessly and holds the reader's attention, until a surprise twist drops you at the end. This book is definitely not for the faint-hearted, but it is an amazing read."
5,Bizarre fun,"I got the book as a birthday present (thank you guys!) and I loved it. A catchy story in Palahniuk's writing style, and unlike Survivor, the ending is not disappointing. Now I can't help but imagine the scenes of the book when I am flying... if you have read the book, you know what I mean!"
4,Funny and Disturbing,"Something really cool happens in this book: you're not too sure where it's going, but it's someplace funny and ridiculous and you're almost there when....But I won't give that away. You have to find out that out for yourself.This is the first book I've read by Chuck Palahniuk and I really enjoyed it. The choppy style really suits the absurd story and tangling thought processes of the bizarre characters. If I had any problems with it, it would be that if Palahniuk could find something really disgusting and revolting to describe in any scene...he did. Whether it's bodily secretions or questionable hygiene or something else smelly or crusty, he made sure to point it out during the story.If you can get past that--and very graphic descriptions of sex acts and elderly neglect--you'll have some really good laughs."
4,Starts slow; ends fast.,"This is the second Chuck Palahniuk book I have read having started with the frightening, ""Haunted."" I liked Choke, didn't love it. It was a fantastically quick read. I enjoyed the character of Victor Mancini, but the author does not present anything likeable about him. I would venture a guess that this is the authors style throughout his catalog. Choke is a biting social satire and will make the reader rethink views on addiction."
4,Quite a...ahem... vivid book.,"This book surprised me at first with it's vivid commentary on sexual situations occuring between the sex-addicted main character and random women. Being someone that appreciates a good writer, I quickly learned that the author isn't so much a pervert, as someone with a great amount of talent. The book was always a page-turner, but every once in a while, I'd hit about two chapters that went on a little more than they should. It is all worth it in the end though, when everything comes together. I enjoyed this book a lot and read it very quickly."
2,Sigh....,"I'm not finished yet but am close to being finished. Know what I mean? The book lags quite a bit. I read so many positive reviews and decided to ignore my best friend who thought it wasn't Chuck's best work... Guess what? It really isn't. It's a laborious read and he goes on and on and on about a lot of bs. Just when you think it's going to get good it slides into a pit of mud from which there is no escape. Fortunately for this book, I have to read whatever I pick up... Finish reading even if I'm all ready finished.I must say that he's seriously one of my favorite writers. I'd have to read this book anyway whether I like it or not. I wish I would have listened to my friend though and read Survivor instead. What a bummer."
4,Chuck Shocks Again!,"""What would Jesus NOT do?"" is the mantra of Victor, our loser hero. And I use the term hero loosely. So imagine the lengths he takes to be as anti-christ-like as humanly possible. Choke is another Chuck classic that pushes boundaries and leaves you questioning EVERY character's sanity.(I was disappointed when I realized that Amazon had not published my first review. I guess I gave away too many of the raunchy details. Enjoy the gore!)"
4,HMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmm..............................,"Heres where I place Choke in the Palahniuk universe: Not as good as Fight Club or Survivor but a lot better than Invisible Monsters (really did not like IM for some reason). Choke started out well and was going well right up to the last few chapters--Palahniuk was going for something really really big and right when you find out the truth--he yanks everything away, his build up just fizzles away into a no-ending. Now the book is decent on its own, but after FC and Survivor, I felt like I had Palahnuik Blue-Balls. It leads up into nothing. Ah well it was a worthy try, a decent 3 1/2 stars--I may re-read it again to make sure I didn't miss anything, but if your a Palahnuik Newbie, stick with FC or Survivor (if you read Survivor keep your head up for the secret ending). Everyone take care and be safe."
4,my view,"the story of Victor and his unique life perspective is very interesting and very unheard of. At times you could be wondering why in the world is the author telling me this stuff because of the nature of Palahniuks words. But it is a quick read and very worthwhile of reading. Also i reccomend Survivor by Palahniuk also. I hope my advice was useful, so long."
2,Disappointed,Too much profanity for my taste. My first and only book of him was Fight Club and I liked it a lot but this one is kinda stupid.
2,"LAME isn't the right word...oh, yes it is","color me confused. i am over 100 pages in and i cannot take it anymore. my g/f gave it to me for christmas insisting i would like it. total yawn fest. another reviewer said its not for people with a queezy stomach, i dont see how that holds true. another said it is very sexually explicit. maybe, if you've never watched cable television before. the writing style is annoyingly simplistic. see spot run, run spot run. that is what it feels like i'm reading, only slightly more humorous. i'm not interested in giving it anymore opportunity. shrug."
2,Great Writer - - Terrible Book,"From page one of Choke, you immediately know that Chuck Palahniuk is a great writer. Unfortunately, while the prose pops and the story moves quickly, this book ultimately goes nowhere. The story is thin to say the least. Basically, the plot involves a sex addict's ill-planned quest to be a good son. However, most of the book really just amounts to Palahniuk describing bizarre sex practices. Although there are many different ways to tell a story, this ultimately goes nowhere and has little relevance to the plot. The ending, and the events leading up to it are not worth the time."
2,I don't get the hype about this one.,"I've read a lot of Palahniuk's books and this is by far my least favorite. If you want something more interesting, read Survivor, Lullaby or my favorite, Invisible Monsters."
4,Wow?!?!,"Dude is nuts! Completely original. Writing and story is a bit choppy, but by design. I'm going to read more of Chuck's stuff."
3,"Weird. See also: odd, strange","""Weird"" is not the right word, but it's the first one that comes to mind.See also: oddSee also: strangeWhat to say about this book. It was a rather easy read but I didn't care much for it. The plot itself wasn't that bad, it actually kept me entertained and the ending of the book was just short of great although the first word that came out of my mouth was, ""weird"".The reason I gave it a rating of 3 was I just didn't care for some of the other things in the book. I didn't care for the foul language used but at the same time felt it was necessary in order to set the tone for the book. I also didn't care for the multiple sex scenes. I don't think they were excessively descriptive to make it an erotic book and it was a key component in helping establish the character of Victor.I wanted to give this book a rating of 2, but just didn't feel it was fair so I gave it a 3 instead."
2,"Basically, a more innocuous version of ""Fight Club.""","I am one of the few people that did not love ""Fight Club,"" though I found it to be unique and intriguing. In ""Choke,"" you basically find the same Palahniuk formula: terse quirky writing; a main character who has serious problems and despises society (but has the ability to influence those around him), and off-beat disenfranchised side characters. I really could not find any redeeming quality in Victor Mancini, though I appreciated that he was less violent than the narrator in ""Fight Club.""Palahniuk certainly writes in an an idiosyncratic voice, and can dream up some bizarre scenarios. I just don't think he is all that great a writer, and this book isn't terribly interesting. Perhaps in a future work, Palahniuk will finally include even one character who isn't quite so loathsome or insane, as everyone is in ""Choke"" (and in ""Fight Club,"" for that matter)."
2,"I think Chuck ""Choke""d","The jacket lured me in but I can't say the author delivered the goods. Incredibly depressing, gross and bizarre characters and behavior doesn't make for an interesting read. His style can be entertaining but repetition of certain motifs really wears thin even in 256 pages. His attention to detail led to some interesting characterizations but just too weird to really be enjoyable. Think of a young John Irving trying a little to hard to be cute."
3,Not Palahniuk at his best,"Chuck Palahniuk has written some great books over the last few years. In Choke his skill with narration is still top notch. Choke is a quick read full of hilarious and gross moments. The main character Victor Mancini is a con artist that fakes choking spells to capitalize on people's generosity and finds sex by going to sex addiction anonymous meetings. The characters that Victor encounters along the way are just as depraved.There is no doubt that Mr. Palahniuk keeps coming up with clever ideas, but Choke lacks the intriguing story lines of his previous works. Even so the writing is good enough to make the book enjoyable. Choke is required reading for all Palahniuk fans, but for those trying to introduce themselves to his writing there are better places to start."
3,"Disturbing, but ultimately boring","Maybe I just don't ger Chuck Palahniuk, but after reading two of his books (this one and ""Lullaby"") I find his style to be boring. Yes, he peppers his stories with unrelentingly disturbing imagery, and he manages to pull together interesing stories that start out well... but in both of these books things tend to peter out toward the end. When you become apathetic (not disgusted or distressed) about the lead character by the middle of the book, something is wrong. I know he carries a ravenous fan base, but frankly I just don't get it."
3,I was choking...,"I was choking to get through this one. I loveF.C. and Survivor but it took me a while to get through this one. But i thought the sex-addict premise was very original and cool, but the plot that based around it wasn't as interesting."
2,why all the stars,"I couldn't wait to get through this book, just to be done with it. People love a big name and risque characters. Which is great and all, but I found it plain and lacking madness."
2,Im sorry but its just not that good,Now i am a huge fan of chucks works and have read all his books except for lulaby which i am in the process of now and this book at times was just down right boring. The plot is that there really isnt a huge on just mini sub plots about his mom him being jesus or somwthing and a whole load of other [stuff]. The begining was ok but twards the middle and end it just began to repet itself. Now if you would like to read a good book read survivor by chuck now that is a work of art and has a great story line (probley one of my fav books)
2,Not what I expected,This book is disgusting. It goes against the whole nature of humanity. It is the story of a little boy who grows up with his estranged mother - who comes to claim him everytime she gets arrested for various crimes. The mother is mad and the child eventually believes that he is the product of a genetic association between his mother and the foreskin of Jesus Christ. Imagine the storyline. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star because there are several interesting twists throughout the novel
1,Dull,"After not being able to put down Lullabye (and laughing out loud while reading it) I was tremendously disappointed here. I couldn't even finish it, and put it down half way through. It's boring and not funny at all. The characters are all unsympathetic. I wouldn't waste my time."
5,awesome.,It's Chuck Palahniuk. It couldnt be anything less than awesome. I've grown to expect a certain amount of greatness from all of his books. I am rarely ever let down.
4,Couldn't Put it Down,"Some very disturbing stuff, but couldn't put the book down. Took it to read during down times on a trip to see my comedian daughter in LA. At first embarrassed to be a woman my age reading such a book, I was careful to obscure the title whenever I pulled it out of my bag. One day I forgot and the front cover was in full view. I had so many people (mostly 20-somethings, my daughter's generation) comment on what a great book it was, I began to read it unashamedly in public. Not for the faint of heart or sensibility, but a marvelously written, compelling read."
4,Chuck never disappoints!,"Fight club was my first Palahniuk book. The bar was set high and he didn't disappoint. Another reviewer called this book good but basically said Palahniuk used the same shtick as other books...I don't know if pompous is the right way to describe that person,but it's the first word that comes to mind. This was a brilliant, fun book."
4,fun and thought provoking,It is a fun ride. I was never sure where we were going till we got there. But the journey was fun.
4,Great - easy - edgy read,If you're looking for a funny edgy easy read - this is a great book. It's not very deep and the things you do learn... not sure if you'd want to use or not! But it's a GREAT book. You'll have fun w/it.
5,A great read,This book was a very good read. I found it very interesting. It is not for the weak of heart though and definitely not for children. I thought this book was one of the author's best books. It really got you thinking. It also got you so engrossed in the book. I really recommend reading this book.
2,blah,"I saw Fight Club the movie, so I thought this guy might have some good books. I went to get his latest ""Pygmy"", but a reviewer suggested if one hadn't read any of his books to not start with it because it was written in broken english for effect. ok, so I get choke, it looked interesting enough. And for some parts it is but he beats the sex to death and the filth. `like some adolescent being dirty just to be dirty. yuk"
4,one of his best works yet,Chuck is an awesome writer. i have loved everysingle book of his that i have read.
3,just barely better than fair,"This book feels a bit like a few steps backward for ole' chuck. Fight Club was good, but not as good as everyone says. Survivor was really good(in the beginning) and then got very gimicky. And thsi one? Well all of the above except it is sporadically good and sporadically juvenile, and gimicky. If you haven't read any of his works, you may like this o.k., but if you have, it will sound like a bit of a rehash instead of an evolution."
4,Bring this item back!,"I got this little camera on the clearence rack at Meijer for ONLY $3.00!The biggest complaint I have is that Izone film is EXPENSIVE! It is fun however, making your own little stickers, it's excellent for leaving memos, working on scrapbooks. The radio function comes in handy at times too, and has a good sound quality for being so small. WHY did they discontinue this camera?"
2,Please find another xylophone!,"This xylophone is adorable but that's about all it has going for it. I received it in the mail today and decided to send it back within 2 minutes. The tones (and that is being generous) are just terrible. I couldn't play any recognizable tune with them at all. If you're child is into banging, try a drum or another xylophone. The Tap a Tune Xylophone by Little Tykes gets fairly good reviews and is less expensive. I wanted this one for my son because it has the look of a classic toy but that really doesn't matter if doesn't have proper tones."
1,"Plunk, plunk...plunk, plunk...OY!","I love the look of this xylophone--the colors are vibrant; the shape is cute. But the sound quality of the keys is horrible. First of all, the keys are wooden not metal like most xylophones--which is okay, but the product doesn't mention this and the picture is a little misleading. The red key and the orange key sound the same,and the other three make hollow, plunky sounds. Instead, I recommend the Grover 8 Note Children's Xylophone (www.giardinelli.com) if you like metal keys and the 8 Note Wooden Children's Xylophone (www.grothmusic.com) if you prefer wooden keys. Both are beautiful and cost the same, if not a few dollars less..."
3,Charming & popular with son but I wish we had chosen the one with metal keys,This is nicely made and popular with my son. He loves to play it. But the tonal quality is pretty poor. It isn't a musical instrument. We have some friends who have the Plan Toys version with wood and metal. It has a much better sound. I wish we had it instead.
4,A good toy.,"It's not too loud, although the top notes are a bit difficult to hear. It looks nice and colourful and is made very nicely. It's definitely a good toy but my son doesn't tend to play with it for too long at a time."
3,generally a big plan toy fan...,"very aesthetically pleasing, does lack some musical quality. this doesn't diminish my child's entertainment level in the slightest, but it was a little disappointing. still, i'm thrilled with an instrument that isn't tinny and that my child enjoys. i just wish it had more musical quality. look forward to seeing plan toys improve this product design. :)"
2,Cute but not musical AT ALL!,"This toy is adorable. It is well made and very colorful. However, it makes NO noise. It just sounds like wood being hit on wood. There are no real note differentiations between the keys. They all sound the same: ""CLUNK CLINK CLUNK."" It's not rewarding at all for baby to use! She banged on it a few times and now just bites on the drum stick."
3,Good for banging,"The xylophone is cute and my one-year-old loves banging on it with the mallet. But it isn't much of an instrument, even a simple one--the tones don't make any sort of scale, they're really very dissonant in pretty much any combination. The assertion that ""kids can make up and play their own songs"" is just not true, unless your baby is John Cage."
4,"solid, no plastic, nice sound","Nice little xylophone. My child enjoys it, its not unattractive and is holding up to baby's use. It would be nice if it came with instructions for a couple of simple songs but that is what youtube is for."
4,Nice materials.,"I like that this is made of chemical-free materials for my little granddaughter. It's simple, yet gives her an opportunity to make sounds/music. The bright colors are nice too."
5,Colorful Fun,We have had ours for over a year and it's part of our collection of musical toys for our girls. They always enjoy this one.
1,Gorgeous looking. Terrible Xylophone.,"We got given this as a gift for our son's 1st birthday. I was so excited as the colors were so vibrant and design very modern. However as soon as I tried to show him how to play it I was bitterly disappointed. It couldn't play any music - not even Three Blind Mice! There's no proper scale. Makes a great drum/bashing toy, but terrible for actual musical purposes. So I guess it really depends on what you're looking for - bashing toy (buy) or musical instrument (don't buy)."
1,Plan Toy FAILURE. Go for the metal variety.,"I love Plan Toys but this one is a failure. It's irresponsibly designed in that the keys are random pitches, rather then ascending and descending tones. Other than how to bang on things, I'm not sure what Plan Toys is trying to teach children with this toy. Sure it's cute, but go for the metal, pitch perfect variety if you want any educational value. That'll hold an older toddler's attention as he or she grows and keep that developing brain engaged and enticed."
2,"Beautiful to look at, but not to play","We were given this xylophone as a gift, and though it's very nicely made, the wooden keys just aren't very musical. The lowest three notes are vaguely satisfying, but the top two are only clacking noises."
1,not a xylophone-- not even close,"There are no tones to speak of that are different key to key. As a result a child can whack at this thing all they want, but learn only that there is no change in pitch when one hits different keys. Our child was bored with this within a day. I finally found one that was rated for 2 years and under that was metal and had a full octave in C major. This newer one she has played with every day for nearly five months. She's not making ""music"" yet, but she has some idea of how it can be made by watching me play a tune here and there on an actual musical instrument."
2,Not a musical toy!!!!,"It is pretty, but it sounds terrible. You cannot play anything resembling a tune. Save your money and buy a toy that has actual notes. I love the Fisher price baby grand piano that has a complete octave."
1,Not in tune,"My son received this as a gift recently--I was very excited when we first opened it, but the notes it produced are so awfully out of tune. I returned it and we will look for another xylophone that plays standard notes instead."
1,"Attractive, not musical","My purpose in buying a child's xylophone was to teach basic concepts of scale. This one is not tuned to any scale and has minimal musical quality. It's visually soft and pretty, the keys bounce in an interesting way, as they're suspended on elastic strings, and the sound will not hurt your ears, but the tones are random. Also the head of the mallet fits into the one-year-old's mouth, so he popped it in and started tottering around; that is not safe. I'm sending it back."
2,An Atonal Xylophone,"Bought this thing because I admired it's beautiful wood and elegant construction. Then my love was immediately soured when I struck its wooden bars to various plonk noises that had no relation to any musical theory whatsoever. There doesn't even seem to be an attempt at music here, just wooden plonk sounds that don't seem to have any pitch at all.The cheap Fisher Price my son got for Christmas with its metal bars comes a lot closer to approximating the pitches one would expect from something calling itself a musical toy."
4,"Great toy, but stick can be a hazard","I got this toy for my son when he was 10 months old. He loves banging around with it, but the only problem is that because he is teething he is constantly putting the stick in his mouth and trying to walk around with it. Obviously a serious danger. So while the toy is great fun, it does take constant supervision for the one year old crowd."
1,Not musical at all!!!!,"This was a gift we received for my son for Christmas. It looks very cute and the wood is durable, however there are no musical tones to these pieces of wood (two of them, although different lengths, have the exact same ""tone""). I would send it back, but it was received out of the package and it can't be returned. My son does love the drum stick that came with it and uses it on all the other wood pieces we have for him, and actually on everything he can bang around on.Pros - it looks pretty and the ""drum stick"" is of good quality. The wood pieces appear to be durable, but that's it.Cons - it's not musical (which was the main reason for wanting something like this), with the way a child plays it doesn't look like the wood pieces will stay in place for very long (my son loves to bang on his toys and treat them pretty roughly)Would I recommend this to others - no, not at all, even fisher price (although plastic) has a more musical sound"
2,Doesn't play well,"This ""xylophone"" is super cute and stylish. However, It is NOT an instrument. The keys are made out of wood. 2 of the keys sound different. The others sound the same, like you were banging on wood. You cant play anything on this. It is for looks only. A child would get a better sound hitting a picket fence with a stick. I returned it for a proper kid's xylophone."
1,"disappointing for a ""musical instrument""","I thought this would be a great gift for my toddler, who loves toys that make noise. However both the yellow and the green bar have the same pitch when struck with the mallet. Since the xylophone only has 5 bars, it's no fun to get the same note when you strike 2 different colors."
5,Delicious and home cook friendly,"This book is a gem. I feel this book more approachable than, say, ""Mastering the Art of French Cooking"" to today's health-conscious home cooks. I have tried breads (fougasse, pissaladiere) to vegetables to chicken dishes to desserts with excellent results. Try her tartes (pies) for a change from your usual pies; they are truely eye-opening. Besides, it is a joy to read."
5,Perhaps the definitive releases of Firebird and Rite of Spring,"For the listener just beginning to learn the genius composer'sworks, this is one of the best, if not THE BEST places to begin.The selections are chosen from the most popular, most wellknown numbers from Stravinsky, early in his career. Of course,in addition to these well picked, well recorded numbers, therewill perhaps be another 10 CD's (if not more) you will eagerlywant to hear, obviously.I think these 2 CD's are on par, if not slightly better,than the versions recorded with Stravinsky directing, onthe 22 CD EDITION on the Columbia/Sony label, in terms ofmusicianship and recording quality.Great value, as always, from Philips."
1,Ummm I don't think so,"I am an Alyssa Milano fan but i'm not a Alyssa Milano liar.This is not singing no way no how.She's talking not singin.The only songs i do like is Count on Me,Magic In Your Eyes,and Somewhere in Jamaica but they are on other albums anyway she still can't sing."
2,Alyssa Milano was a cute kid back in the 80s,"I used to be a really huge fan of Alyssa Milano, especially from 1988 to 1992 when she was the hottest teenage female actor. I had watched her back in 1984 on Who's the Boss and kept watching until it ended. I watched every television movie, any guest appearance, any awards show, anything she appeared in. I always looked for her music recordings, even though I knew they were only released in Japan. Amazon.com made it possible to obtain her CDs, but... I like the MUSIC of this cd. I am kind of disappointed because it doesn't even sound like her at all. I always thought she had such a sweet voice but you won't hear it in this cd. Her voice is very low (deep) and does not sound natural. It really does not sound like her at all. But the MUSIC is good because it's got that 80s pop sound. I don't regret getting this cd but I don't think I would listen to it too often though. I like her as an actor more than a singer."
5,Just received my order...,"I just ordered this book yesterday and received it today. I am very happy with the content of synonyms and antonyms and definitions that this book has.Perhaps this is my own fault, but I was under the impression that the used books offered were of the newest edition depicted. I received the older version. I love vintage things, so all is not lost."
2,Insufficient,"The title is a misnomer, as there is less than one antonym for each synonym introduced. Moreover, as stated by other people, nouns are inexistant, and some common words are definitely missing. For example, no mention of the word delicious.One could expect from such a respected House.Barely sufficient at high school level, definitely lacking at university level, of little utility to an experienced writer.However, it could form the basis for a good reference book as the planning is judicious!"
5,the Merriam-Webster dictionary of Synonyms and antonysms,The Merriam-Webster Dictionary of Synonyms and Antonyms (Dictionary) (Purchased on 09/03/2008) it is very helpful to me.
3,Hope you can shorten delivery time next time,Book recevide is very well but it took about 2 weeks to receive this order.
2,Pocket-book sized volume printed on newsprint,"I am returning this book, which was ordered alongside the Webster's Collegiate Dictionary. I had expected a sister volume to be the same dimensions as the dictionary, a replacement for my well-worn and beloved college companion. Unfortunately, this product was physically the dimensions of the old pocket books, possibly 4x6 (don't have a tape measure here), printed on newsprint quality paper. I know this is a good reference, so if you are looking for it, make sure the particular volume you are ordering is standard with respect to size and paper quality."
4,Not a bad reference to have,This is a good little book to have handy when you can't think of the exact word you are looking for. I recommend this be part of every aspiring writer's reference bookshelf.
4,Good purchase,Has helped very much with my job and when working from home am glad I made the purchase and will help with future employment.
4,"I am a anacrostic/crostic addict, so this is handy.","I notice it lacks many of the newer computer terms. No blog, byte, etc. I have looked up other words that I wanted a synonym for that weren't in it. Can't remember what now. But if it were more comprehensive, I would never use it as it would be too heavy."
5,Merriam-Webster Doe It Always!,"I am a G.E.D. instructor and highly recommend this book for my students, as well as any person undertaking writing, proper speaking and pronunciation. A must have!"
5,cheap and fast way to review for GRE verbal,This little gem is an effective way to review nuances. Synonyms that most people think are interchangeable have subtle differences that can make or break the sentence's meaning. Well worth your money.
5,Very usefull,"It is an excelent book, I bought it to improve my english knowledge and it's being usefull for me nowdays..."
2,"A good primer, but limited to the school house","I've read the book, but cannot recommend it for anything other than the academic world. The environment that the author proceeds from in this book is too limited to make it useful as a real-world guilde to process reengineering.Comments like, ""A business is a collection of processes"" can be seen as a valid point, however, discounting the employees and relegating them to the status of mindless automatons limits the usefulness of this book to a Business 101 class.On a positive note, the author makes a good point that businesses need to review the processes they use and ensure that they are accomplishing these processes in the most efficient manner possible.While the book could be used for building the case for process engineering/re-engineering, there are better books available for the nuts and bolt of actually doing the process changes."
3,Leaves the reader wanting for more.,"I found the book to be an easy read, touching upon some total quality management principles I would love (perhaps wishfully) to see implemented more in the industry. There are far too few businesses where the Information Systems departments are looked at as profit centers.I am rereading this book in preparation for passing it on to the management where I work. Although they probably will not agree with what it contains sadly. A recommended read."
4,Rare vision and clarity,"This book offers rare clarity and vision during a time when IT sorely needs it. I highly recommend this book. It is a marvelously compelling read that really changed my attitudes and perceptions about how to use technology effectively within business. I have seen a lot of people talk, talk, talk business process and IT, but this is the first actually useful information that I have found that demonstrates how to actually accomplish it.Apparently the reader from San Francisco did not actually read Achieving Process Profitability and has some kind of personal grudge against the author. I find it distressing that someone would be so mean-spirited and cowardly anonymous."
5,Beethoven played on these strings,"When my package arrived, I didn’t even realize that I had purchased a pack of three with the price being as low as it was. The strings ring out like someone just showered my ears in the songs of eagles frolicking in the sky. Great sound, great price point. 10/10 Would definitely purchase again."
5,Love these strings,"Tried them all. These are the best sounding in my book. They last pretty long for non-coated strings and play nicely, too."
4,good,good 3 sets; and still have it on my guitar; good vibrations for the soul; depending on your music; and vibes!
3,Back from the smoke,They tune well and seem to hold tuning. They seem hard on my fingertips but my fingers are coming back after a good twenty years.
3,Too much shipping cost for a small quantity,"D'Addario strings are great. When I saw the price on Amazon, it looked good. But I ordered only 1 three pack along with a purchase of shoes. The shipping charge looked fine for the order until I got the invoice and saw that the whole charge, almost $6, was for the strings. Goodbye savings. Maybe if I bought several packs it would have been the same. But, next time, I'll go to my local music store."
5,Excellent Strings,This was my first time purchasing new strings for my guitar. I didn't have any problems when installing them and i'll buy them again once my set is finished. The strings are medium sized so the sound projects out really well.
2,strings werent fresh,The strings packaging was damaged (not from transport). Air to the strings caused oxidation. The sound should be very bright and fresh and crisp and it just was not. Very dulled sound from the lower strings. Had to get new strings immediately.
5,No nonsense!,"I'm a beginner, so I can't comment on the sound quality of the strings, but I received the strings w/o any hassles!"
5,My strings of choice for over 20 years,"Ever since I switched to playing a 6 string more then my 12, I have used DAddario strings. Always a clear sound last good to.My playing buddies always notice how good old guitar sounds. The secret is not a secret, Daddario."
2,Not what I thought i would get.,"My guitar originally came with D'Addrio exp and they sounded good. I replaced them with Elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good, but the finish was wearing fast. This time I got a 3 pack of EJ16-3d light. The were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly.But the sound is the problem. It's terrible. They sound very muddy. Crisp tone distinction is just not there. I thought light would be the better route, but now I'm not sure. I purchased some others to try. Also, since a purchased a 3 pack. I may just change the strings completely again to see If I just have some dead strings."
4,Convenient and Good Value,I was pleased with my purchase of D'Addario 3-pack Acoustic Guitar Strings. It is very convenient to have extra sets on hand and the price was very good.
3,Compare to LaBella Silk & Steel,I have used La Bella silk and steel strings for decades on my 1964 Gibson J-50. Can anyone looking at this compare these strings with the La Bellas?
2,Not the best quality,I'm glad there are three sets in the pack because the G string broke while I was tuning. I tune my guitars a bit low so it is did not break due to over tightening. It was defective and snapped at the tuning key after one wind. They are so inexpensive it is not worth trying to send them back so I will just use them up. Maybe only one of the sets had a defective string. But I will not know that for quite a while.
2,Sound Horrible,U have an ovation-acoustic. These strings sound so flat and low key. Will not buy again! And yes my guitar is tuned and strings were put on correctly lol!!
5,Works for me,"Low end made in China dreadnaught acoustic - Bristol - actually sounds somewhat fantastic in terms of low end resonance and sparkling high end.Here's what I've found. The way you string the guitar makes a difference. With practice I've become more proficient.Curve the ball ends for better seating under the bridge plate. Not just a simple bend but kind of bend them over my thumb so they can sort of catch before inserting the bridge pin. Then check with a mirror and flashlight to confirm.I use a locking pattern on the tuning pegs and keep the string quite tight so it loops tightly around the peg.Then I use a microfiber cloth and wipe down each string after each time playing, - use my little finger to hook the cloth under each string and wipe down each length.Try to practice for about an hour daily. The tone as I say is pretty darn good. Played a high end adirondack, rosewood, name brand and was disappointed that it didn't sound that much better to me."
5,perfect,These strings stay in tune VERY well and have a nice bright look! I purchased the light ones and love them!
5,Good strings,"I'm new to acoustic so I'm not too sure how things go, but from what I have learned from using these pics is that they seem pretty good. A little to thick for my style though. They make a very deep and loud noise. I prefer placing electric strings on acoustic. They sound much better and aren't quite as loud."
5,Settle in quickly,"I've been using D'Addario strings regularly for a couple of decades, so I can't pretend now to be familiar with the competition. But I've stuck with them for the following reasons:• They're extremely reliable — I can't remember the last time I had a dud string.• Their sound is excellent and they last a long time.• They settle in extremely quickly (this is a biggie for a professional musician).• They have eco-friendly packaging.I use J16s on my folk guitar, which is a Taylor 510. In standard tuning they're fine; but when I drop the bass string to D (which I do a lot), it tends to go sharp when fretted. So I replace this set's .053 with a .056. Were I playing in DADGAD all the time (which I feel more and more inclined to do), I would use Pierre Bensusan's stringing, which is (according to hisfirst video) .056, .042, .032, .023, .017 & .013."
5,Great strings for a Gibson Songwriter,"I have been searching for a set of strings that have great low end and are lighted enough to play solo's high on the neck. Basically, I want my Gibson Songwriter deluxe acoustic to play as close to my Gibson Les Paul as possible...... and these strings do the trick! They also hold their bright tone for a long time."
1,sound is bad,"My husband asked for the medium, but after he installed them on his acoustic guitar, he immediately asked me to order the light. The tone of the medium sounded like the guitar was out of tune."
2,Disapointed with Sound Quality,In my opinion the D'Addario EJ26 is very poor sounding set of acoustic strings. These are nowhere near as bright as DR strings and the snap was gone after one day of use. I went into a small shop that I became aware of close to home and they didn't have DRs so on the salesman's recommendation I tried D'Addario. This will be the last time. I'll drive the extra miles for DRs.
5,D'Addario EJ16 ten pack light acoustic strings,"These strings sound great after an hour or two break-in. Once settled in they stay in tune and last a long time. I play them on an Ovation 1778 and on my Epiphone AJ-30. Very good tone and harmonics. Good price on the 10 pack. Thanks, R.C."
1,Defecive Product!,"Not sure what to say. I have used D'Addario strings as long as I've played and these strings were brutal. I have never had a low E snap before and have also never purchased the 3 pack but each snapped on different guitars. The first I stretched and let sit over the course of 20 minutes, tuning up and down. After it broke I then strung the other two guitars strings and I let them sit over night. Tried to tune them up to E this morning and both broke. The other strings seem fine but the tension on the Low E was recognizably higher. Very disappointed. I could see snapping the G string a few times but Low E after sitting over night? Got to be a deficient string in these packs..."
3,D'Addario strings,"These are good strings for the price but like most things these days, the quality isn't what it used to be. While changing strings, the end of the B string fell right off in the guitar. I was able to repair it and use the string, I was at home, but if I had been at a gig and had to fish around in my guitar body for a string end it would have been a real bummer."
5,Good strings,"I've played for many many years and these are always the strings I grab to throw on a new guitar or to start as a base for a guitar I'm working on the sound with. They don't last as long as some of the coated strings, but hey they aren't nearly as expensive either. No complaints, decent sound, good feel. They will leave a black resin on your fingers when you first jam on em but so will most. For the value, you can't beat it."
4,Good strings at a good price,"I like these strings; they're comfortable and have a nice, full sound. I used to play with Elixirs, but they deadened the sound too much. I'm using the EJ16-3Ds right now on a Gretsch and a Yamaha--both acoustic electrics. I gave a set to a friend who plays a Martin D35, and he says he's getting these from now on too. String life is probably only about average; otherwise I'd give them 5 stars."
2,Not what I expected,"Although I got my shipment promptly, and it had 3 sets as stated.I pretty much only got 2 sets out of it and some extra strings.As 1 of the sets of three had 2 B strings and was missing the high E string.What really is a drag is the high E string is the one that breaks the most.The only good that can come of this is if all my strings but the high E breaks before I have to change them."
5,These Strings Are Definately Good... But...,"On a dreadnought, the lower strings (E and A) are really boomy. I can tell they would be good for a more balanced guitar so that's why I still think these are worth five stars. I switched over to the light version of these strings now (EJ16) after hearing that Tommy Emmanuel usually uses them. Everything is much more balanced on my dreadnought now; the lows, mids, and highs--it just sounds right. I've also tried the custom light gauge from D'Addario, but they are WAY too slinky, no oomph or tone at all! I'd definitely say the light gauges are the best of the bunch, but have still yet to buy the extra light gauge (if I do I'll update this)."
2,Not satisfied at all.,First string snapped while I was putting it on for the first time. I've strung many guitars and this has never happened to me. Waste of 5$ and my time.
4,Great!,Good quality strings. Perfect for acoustic guitars. Definitely my go-to strings for playing shows live. D'addario is by far the best
5,Nice,"They are easier to play on the the medium gauge strings that came with my guitar. I am a beginner so although they still hurt my fingers they were an improvement. They also have a pretty color to them, and the ends of the strings (the ones that go in the holes during installation) are color coded and come with a chart, which makes things easy."
3,"Tried these, but not what I was looking for","I bought a set of these, because my local music store didn't stock the strings that I really wanted. Even though these say Extra Light, Phosphor Bronze is harder to play than 80/20 bronze. I wanted the lightest possible strings for my steel string Acoustic to make it feel more like an Electric. I probably won't buy another set of these.Good features:Stay tuned okSeem Durable enoughBright toneWound 'G' string, if you're into thatPhosphor Bronze maybe more corrosion resistantBad features:Harder to play than 80/20 BronzeMore neck tensionMore friction when changing chordsNot enough Bass for Blues and RockThese strings seem quality made, they're just not the style I'm looking for. I've tried a half dozen phosphor bronze would strings, and I've been disapointed every time. 80/20 Bronze is much easier to play and give me the feel and sound that I'm used to. Too bad my local music store didn't stok what I really wanted. I probably won't be back."
2,Eh,"I usually use Elixir medium PB but since they are so expensive I decided to try an alternative. I play my guitar pretty hard so this might be a special case. BUT. What a difference, when I put em on they sounded great. I couldnt tell a difference. But after an hour of playing the g string had already started deteriorating in some spots. then after a few hours my fingers were green (never had that with elixir) and the strings got a little worse. the next day the strings looked like they had been on there years. very dark color, not much tone out of them either.back to my elixirs."
1,No box. Product not as shown.,"Got my 3 sets of guitar strings, but no box. Each set is just in the plastic anti-corrosion bag. The only way I can identify the set is by the numbers: ej16-10p.All of the times when I bought the 3 set packs of D'Addario strings in the past I got a box that says what the strings are and list the string gauges. Valuable information when I have 10 different kinds of strings currently. Gotta write on the bags with a sharpie. Not worth the hassle of returning."
2,string is a little tin eeeee,i've liked this brand of string in the past but for me maybe its the weight (dont see the weight written anywhere on the oackage) or this 3-pack set of string doesnt sound so great on my inexpensive takamine jasime not much bass range and the sound is a bit weak id probably buy this brand again but surely not this specific product
4,Gadzooks - the real Dr. Dobson,"The book was ""easy to ready"" with each chapter giving pertinent information of how Focus on the Family came about and why it is successful. Paul Batura is able to give a insiders view to the founder, Dr. James Dobson, in a way that puts flesh on the voice heard on radio. When you're done reading the book, you come away with definite themes that are important to Dr. Dobson with the most important one being ""be there"" which communicates the importance of having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ in light of the story to his son, Ryan after the death of Pete Maravich. This book is a must read for those who think they know about Focus on the Family and Dr. James Dobson."
5,Gadzooks! I want more!,"I loved this simple, practical approach to leadership! While reading the principles I found myself wanting to apply them to my teens. Where is the teen version?? Because the format is easy to read and the stories make it easy to remember, this could make for a great home study as well as office study!Everyone in my office and in my family will read this book to better understand a true approach to successful leadership."
4,Insights into the practices of a top Christian leader,"Gadzooks! reminds me in some ways of a management book, yet it's also filled with many stories that bring the reader into the more personal world of Dr. Dobson. I have gone over several points I hope to implement in to my own management practices, including:-- keeping communication simple and direct-- being humble and honest when admitting a mistake and spending more energy on learning from it rather than crafting an excuse-- the power of timing when delivering informationIt's a great read for anyone interested in the drives and practices of Dr. James Dobson of Focus on the Family!"
3,Peninsular Primer,"Readers will find this handsome paperback an affordable introduction to the Napoleonic campaigns on the Iberian peninsula. Nicely illustrated with artwork of peninsular scenes and good basic maps, it's well-laced with quotes from participants and salted with mood-setting Napieresque purple prose. Unfortunately it suffers from Anglo-centricism, as do most English-language texts on the subject, but does refrain from the most biting criticism of Englands's Iberian allies. Nevertheless Parkinson's work is a good starting point from which to move on to the best single-volume history, David Gate's THE SPANISH ULCER (available soon in PB). I also recommend De Rocca's In The PENINSULA With a FRENCH HUSSAR, Hibbert's WHEATLEY DIARY & RIFLEMAN HARRIS (both PB), and August Schaumann's delightful On The ROAD With WELLINGTON."
5,this is a great book!,This is my second book from Ms. Dodd and I really enjoyed it. It's a good story. The characters are good and the pace is fast! I highly reccomend this and other books by the author!
3,Just Okay,"I just finished reading ""One Kiss From You"" and I feel that it was just lukewarm. I was really eager to get my hands on the sequel to ""Scandalous Again"" because it was fantastic. However, this book has very little plot to it, it is the same old story about revenge and though some of chapters were interesting, I felt like I had to force myself to keep going, in case something really good would come up. Usually Christina Dodd's books are able to incite great sympathy or heartbreak for the characters, but not for this book. I've also noticed that she's rolled out several books in a short period of time. Perhaps she needs a break to refresh her originality."
2,actually...2.5 stars...heres why...,"first book from her that is not from the Rules of trilogy... disappointing... its about her pretending to be her cousin to meet her future husband.... her uncle had lost the hand of her cousin, Madeline to Remington....he said he wanted her titles and gain a place in society but Eleanor sensed that there is more....his vengence....revenge...Then she fall head over heels in love with him... he wanted to married her... he did not know her true identity.... until the wedding vows were said.... he was furious...later someone wants his life and now his wife is at risk...will they save the day??i don't know..i just feel something is lacking in this book... its just too sudden that she falls in love...and i just feel not involed in the murder case(the one which had remington's family killed)....try the rules of trilogy from her instead..."
5,One kiss from you,This is the second time I've read this book and I enjoyed it just as much as the first. I find I enjoy the romances by Christina Dodd as much as Johanna Lindsey.....who is my all time favorite romance author.
3,Too Controlling,"This book moved along nicely, and I won't recapitulate the plot as this has been well done by others. I suppose ultimately our hero turned out to be a marshmallow, but I thought initially he was very controlling and leopards tend not to change their spots. Upcoming domestic violence were all I could think about instead of happily ever after.I also found it irritating that this heroine fell in love with the hero before he changed his spots. Nope, this one was not for me."
2,Yawn...,"I didn't like Elanor. She was such a ninny and let everyone push her around. And all the talk about 'the duchess' grated on my nerves. And her thinking about 'what would Madeline do' was... Well, couldn't she just make something up on her own? Did she always need someone to guide her? There was nothing in this book that would hold my interest. Boring."
5,one of my favorites.,"I loved this book. The heroine blossoms before our very eyes, and the hero is just crazy about her. I love the story, and the sex scenes were great. The heroine was adorable. I greatly recommend it."
5,SonicWeb Mosquito Control; I wish they still made it!,"I've had my original SonicWeb unit since the first summer that WEST NILE was terrorizing the equine industry. I purchased a second one a few years later. Now I cannot find it or its refills anywhere, so apparently it is no longer made. WHAT A SHAME. It has done a wonderful job for us and we have horses, dogs, cats, chickens and have had in the past even cattle here on our place. The area in the half acre around our house has far fewer mosquitoes and flies when using the SonicWeb. I originally bought it because I had read a study done on it by a university in Florida, which showed it to be highly effective. COME BACK SONICWEB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Sonic Web Failures,I have owned two sonic web units. Both worked like champs for a while and then both failed. I was pleased with the number of bugs that they caught but I only got a few months of use out of the first unit and one season out of the second unit.For the premium price they should have lasted for years not months.I would not recommend this product due to the short life span.
4,Actually works,"The best is that is runs off electric and you don't have to worry about changing that propane all the time. I was nervous at first, but after a week I had to change the trap due to dead bug overflow. My wife didn't even know we add this thing and commented on how she did not see as many bugs lately."
1,Buy a mosquito Magnet.,Tried both traps. Mosquito Magnet was supremely effective. This one was not. Read the entymological research and it is pretty clear why.
4,"Works incredibly well, even when the power cord no longer works!!","We have had our SonicWeb for two summers. The SonicWeb has definitely been worth it! Our mosquito population was cut down to very little and we live next to two bodies of water. We couldn't believe how great it worked. The replacement bug catchers were reasonable in price too. We noticed that it worked better when we put it out at the beginning of Spring and then left it out until the end of Fall. The power cord no longer works so the ""heartbeat"" sound doesn't work anymore but because of the scent stick and bug paper, the trap still works great. We just cut the cord and used it for the rest of the season that way. We plan on buying another one, it worked so well."
5,Straight up feel good beach music!,"I'll keep this simple. If you want music that takes you away to the beach, not just the Keys, then this it! I found Mr. Livingston on Amazon by accident, and I'm really glad I did! Keep up the good work"
2,A disappointment,"I was so excited to try this product out! It is definitely NOT user friendly. After a lot of work and frustration, I created a beautiful slide show of my twins' first year of life. I anticipated playing it back on our television during their birthday party. Recording this finished product to disk was a bit difficult. Once I accomplished that, I was HIGHLY disappointed with the quality. When you ""preview"" your slideshow on the computer, it comes up ""small"" and the quality is fantastic. When you play it back ""full size"" on your computer, the quality is VERY poor. Therefore, I don't think I'll even attempt to view it on television, at an even bigger size! I'm disappointed to say the least. I like that I have a slideshow, and it is Pooh themed, with music to boot, but I sure wish the quality were a lot better."
2,"I wish his middle name was ""sayless""",This was an interesting and useful book but Mr Seymour Smith is very opinionated and injects his opinion into every area of the book.His personal politics also come to the fore much more often than necessary and welcome.If you can get it at a deep discount it is worth it.
3,Good source for a list of classic books to read,"Martin Seymour-Smith shares insightful knowledge about the socio-economical and political times of when each book is written, and a wealth of interesting personal facts, both which bear light on how the authors were influenced at the time of their writing. Each book review is presented rather like they were transcripts from a class presentation and are no more than 3-5 pages in length. The edition I read was probably an editing nightmare due to some of the choppy sentences, which is why it appears to come directly from his lectures. He comes across with an arrogance toward some of the authors that at first is shocking; after a while I just skipped over his personal comments. A good source for a list of classic books to read, and provides a quick glance into each book and author."
2,Disappointing,"This book is not so much about the CONTENT, but rather the INFLUENCE of ""The 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written"". It was not what I expected/hoped for. That said, the author's rather subjective opinions (and diatribes against academics, historians, ...) made it hard for me to separate the author's views from more widely accepted interpretations of these 100 books."
2,Agreed: pompous author.,"Ditto the ""pompous"" label from other reviewers. Also, you would hope that the author would be a little more impartial, but his admiration of Gnosticism (including strong favor of Kaballah and Judaeo-Christian-based Gnosticism with scorn of Old Testament and New Testament) and esoterica is blatant, adding bias.Despite pomposity and bias, this book does have value as a nice list of reknown works, including Eastern works (I Ching, etc.), and notable non-fiction including science (Popper, etc) and economics (Smith, Keynes), as well as Western staples (Homer, Aristotle, Dante, etc). The brief review of each work often (but not always) portrays the work's value, so it is a nice guide to browse. However, it is not encyclopedic, so for those purposes, Wikipedia will serve better.There must be better guides to the best works of the humanities. Unless the price is right, keep looking."
1,Historian with a muddled agenda,"The author spends far too much time defending his choices against invisible enemies (bureaucrats being a favored target) and far little time on the content and its influence. One imagines his editor overlooking the worst of what made it into the book out of sheer exhaustion, unwilling to bring another battle to bear. Consider this ridiculous summation of his entry on Homer: ""...and already the robot-clerks who, with plastic identification buttons on their lapels[gasp!], plan curricula, have no place for them [his works]. Only when it is pointed out to them that sales of Homer have made money for hundreds of years do their dead eyes seem to glint."" What a dope."
1,The most irritating book i have ever read!,"Well, the title of this review tells everything. Not only the author is arrogant, but he also has his ""own"" personal ideas about everything. Most of the time they are agnostic ideas, but he is not so ""coherent"" all the time.1. Choice of books is not bad. Maybe everyone can have his top 100, but we can't say, his choices are wrong.2. After reading it, you will NOT understand:a) What was written in the ""famous"" book?b) Why the book was so important?But you will understand:a) What author of this book ""thinks"" about the famous author.3. There is no bibliography4. Author, evidently is not a philosopher, nor theolog, nor physician, but anyway he has his ""own"" on everything.What I wait from a book like this is:1. The content of the famous book.2. How it became famous.3. What was his impact (or influence) in the history of the world.That's allMr. Smith did properly the opposite.Money and time wasting book."
1,A biased presentation by an incapable author,"Although most of us would acknowledge some or most of the books picked, it is by no means close to the 70-30 ratio guessed by the author. But what hurts the most is Seymour-Smith's arrogance that grows into plain stupidity on his reviews and method of selection(not to mention coward attacks on defenseless popular authors).I never bought a book written by such a malignant mind. Save your money, Martin Seymour-Smith not only likes the sound of his own demented voice way too much, but makes sure to affirm that it is the only one that bears truth!"
2,Without Bhagavad Gita/ Gandhi writings,I am surprised and did not find any reason why the author choosed not to mention even the names of either the Great Bhagavad Gita or the Great Gandhism writings. How can any book titled as above can begin or conclude without Gita/Gandhi.It is very much disappointing.
1,THUMBS DOWN,Obviously written by an agnostic liberal. What about Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand? Most people have said they were highly influenced by this book.
2,uh...,"It works but then it became unreadable, and I lost all the pictures taken because it reads as full but shows up empty. *shrug* To get the pictures recovered cost $200"
1,Fuji XD Picture Card,I gave this product no stars because it is an out-of-box failure. It will not store pictures
5,2gb xd memory card,"Plug it in, and it works. No problems whatsoever. I called Fuji before buying this card to determine the difference between an 'M' card (this one) and an 'H' card. H is for high speed, but Fuji says the camera cannot take advantage of the high speed anyway, due to it's limitations. So the M card is what they recommend."
4,"Very Nice Price, Very Nice Card!","Fast Delivery, and a crapload of space for picstures and vidz. I can shoot a 55 min video on my Fuji Camera without any issues and still fit another 50 pics as well.Like I said Crapload of space!!!"
3,Unknown,Can not really rate this product don't remember purchasing it or ever using it. Must have been some time ago
5,They work fine.,"They work fine. They hold lots of pics, and no problems. Service from Amazon partner was great, too."
3,Too Big For Me,To Big For Me everytime I download the pictures to my computer it down loads all the pictures stored on my camara that I haven't deleted so it's a little to big for me.
2,Ill find some use for it,"It turns out my camera will not recognize that big of a card, but i find somebody that can use it"
5,1st time user,"haven't had much time to really get a good grasp on the overall quality yet, but so far, so good."
2,absurd shipping charge,"product sent fromDigital media,qty2 were ordered of fujifilm 2gb xd flash memory in one order & $5.95 shipping was charged for each card.Amazon claims to try to reduce shipping costs but uses sellers with unfair practices.beware when ordering from any vendor as this type policy cancels any price savings!!1 click only when you know exactly what sellers policy is first."
3,"adorable, but not a toy for snuggling...","My son received this for his first birthday. It really is adorable, and the talking/singing aspect is nice, but due to the mechanism in Pooh which makes his chest rise as he snores, it is lacking in cuddlability. My son enjoys playing with itand does watch the tummy rise."
2,Where Angels Fear to Tread,"I recently read this book for a Latin American history course and I must say its the least interesting book I have read in a good while. A topic of note to be sure, however the author's style makes for some plodding reading and the book itself is not structured very well for those not instantly familaur with the subject at hand. In any case one does gleam a substanial amount of understanding of the conflcits between the secular and nonsecular clergy, as well as interesting gender and racial conflicts which existed at the time.Certainly not a book for a general reader of history, although more then likely of interest for upper-division students of early Latin American history and those studying womens issues within the Church."
3,The Earth is My Patient,"Written by instructor David Arieti, the mad scientist ... mad, as in fervently expressing the need to save our planet. His loathing for politicians and love of telling jokes shines through. Not a particularly strong writer but his passion shines through and his intentions are infectious.Yes, I had to buy the book as a required text for the course. Still, it is an easy, relevant book that gets you thinking about what we are leaving behind through over consumption and waste and how we are creating a sick earth (thus, The Earth is My Patient)."
3,item incomplete when received,"this is not a criticism of amazon, they are great ... this is a about the product i received; a part was missing, i called cs for the manufacturer and they are sending the part ... the problem is there was no apology, no ""i'm sorry your lathe was incomplete"" ... another place that needs better employes, better policies better management"
4,A solid mini-lathe,"I bought this lathe as a ""2nd"" lathe, primarily to support the turning of lace bobbins and pens.It is solid lathe, well usable within it's limits. Don't expect to turn 8 inch (dia) 10 inch long, rough cut, hollow-forms. It's ain't designed for that.The only down-side, is changing speeds. But then I leave the lathe at high-speed, as all I turn with it are small spindles."
5,Best lathe out there for $250,"Let me start off by saying that this lathe is made very well. The headstock lines up perfectly with the tailstock and the toolrest/tailstock both slide smoothly over the base. Changing speeds is fairly simple, even though the motor is not variable. My only complaint is the lack of a good location for storing the drift rod. You may want to consider buying an extension for this lathe, since it is currently limited to turning small objects.Very good overall. Definitely worth the money."
3,Gates Caravan belt kit,Same problem with the belt slipping off on my Caravan in the rain. This kit is a great idea and so far does what it is supposed to.Installed this myself as many others have. My only concern is that the grooved pulley is plastic. I would feel a lot more at ease if they just made this out of steel like the original. I would be willing to pay the extra $10 bucks!. How long will this plastic/nylon pulley last under all that tension?.Plastic.....really?...come on!
1,It still squeals!!!!!!!,"Installed kit 2 week ago and it started squealing again. I thought I had finally found a fix, but no, it still squeals. I started out with new original belt and pulleys. Tried ""better"" belt, no help. Found this kit on line, no help!!!!"
5,Gates Belt Drive Kit,"After exhausting all options that I was aware of to fix the serpentine belt coming off, I purchased and installed the Gates Kit. Prior to this, I was going to get rid of the car,(like so many others that I had read or heard about). I can only say that I have not had a problem up to this point, but I am very hopeful, based on the long term success that I have read others have had. This is a very inexpensive fix(I did it myself), and even if you have to have a mechanic install it, it will probably cost less than 1 monthly car payment. If you have doubts about your ability to install, take it to a mechanic. The only difficulty I had installing the kit was installing the belt itself. It is extremely tight and difficult to get on. That said it does work as advertised.The service that I received from Amazon was excellent. Very quick delivery and No problems. Easy way to shop and receive whatever at your doorstep. Thanks!"
5,Gates Enhancement,"This product seems to be the perfect solution, other than giving the dealer $600.00for a repair. Just find the correct mechanic to put it on. Some may tell you it's thewrong part, however the part # is a match from the dealers part # just check it outfirst and you'll be fine."
4,Gates Serpentine Belt Solution,I received the Gates Kit the next day (even though I only asked for slow delivery) and got it installed that weekend. It took about 2 hours to install (Had to have the van on ramps and have some long extensions on the ratchet) but it installed easily. Everything fit perfectly. I have since taken it in a 45 minute heavy rain trying to get it to slip off and it stayed on. I also reinforced the plastic guard with some flat metal drilled through and bolted on to make the guard hold the shape it was inteded to have. I think it is solved! It did what it was supposed to do!
2,NOT ALL PARTS INCLUDED,"THE SERPENTINE BELT AND PULLEYS WERE GOOD, BUT THERE WAS NO BOLT OR SPACER WASHER INCLUDED FOR THE IDLER PULLEY."
4,BIG scoop,"For the price I paid, a great deal. I use it primarily to get spent grains out of my mash tun. It is very big so if you need something that needs to fit into smaller spaces, you might be happier with a smaller size."
3,"Works Well, But Don't Store It In The Freezer!","Excellent scoop for the price, is being used for dog food scoop (58 oz. is HUGE) and works great for that purpose. However, the solid metal construction would be a disadvantage if stored in freezer - instant skin removal and contamination of ice."
5,58 oz ice scoop,The 58 oz. ice scoop was just what we needed. We bag our own ice and needed something larger than a regular kitchen scoop. This scoop filled the bill.
5,Boring?,"This is an excellent set of the Ravel's solo piano music. Werner Haas was a pupil of Walter Gieseking and it shows. He has a great sense of color and dynamic control. The music shimmers when it needs to - which is often in Ravel. His technique is incredible, I don't remember any wrong notes and he doesn't fudge the tempos which - I believe - is crucial to this music as nothing can disfigure pieces like Gaspard or Jeux D'eau like some overly exaggerated rubato!!Yes, the recording is old (1954, I think) and not up today's standards, but it's not one of those scratchy old mono recordings where you can barely hear the music - not even close!In short, it's a deal, so what are you waiting for?If you really want to hear wrong notes (and appreciate inspiration more than anality) check out Vlado Perlemuter. He's great!"
4,The right pianist for the job,"The late Werner Haas may not have been the most technically gifted pianist ever to essay Ravel's music (although there's nothing wrong with his technique, either) but he clearly had an affinity for this composer and an impeccable sense of how to put it over. Ravel benefits from a certain Gallic coolness and reserve, an attention to shading along with surface glitter--and this is what you get from Haas, in the solo works as well as in the two concerti. Sonically, these 1960s tapings are dated if clear and well-balanced, but that doesn't diminish the value of this Philips twofer, which is a fine bargain."
2,don't buy this cd,I bought this because I wanted the complete piano works for a good price. But the quality of this cd is not good. The orchestra has a metallic sound to it and the pianest has rather boring interpretations.
1,Good idea but poor execution,"These cards were a big disappointment. My son (age 8) loves science and loves quizzes so I thought he'd enjoy this game. The questions are poorly designed -- mostly True/|False or Yes/No questions. Most of the questions are too easy/obvious for a reasonably well-read 8 year old. My son declared them to be ""boring"" after just a few cards and I had to agree. Will now take them to a charity shop. Sadly, thinking the idea of the cards was good, I bought two other sets (art and US Presidents). Based on this sample, I'll leave the other two unopened and donate them as well. There are much better ""educational"" games available. Don't waste money on this one!"
3,Not enough questions,"These really are great, but I wish they'd ad more questions. The game ends too quickly for my son and I."
3,"A little bit rough, but loved.","I bought the comforter and sheet set, although it is a little rough, I liked the design. Of course both comforter and sheets were washed before use, it didn't really change the texture. I think after a few more times it may be softer. Personally, the fleece throws are quite nice and comfortable. But, regardless of my opinion...MY SON LOVES EM""!"
3,"Nice theme, but not so nice quality","My son loves Cars so for his birthday I got him the bedding. Ick. He loves it, but it feels so stiff that I don't know how he sleeps in it. It's scratchy too. The colors have held to all the washings I have done to get it softer (no luck there)."
2,a real disappointment,"Although I haven't listened to all of it extensively, I found that both the Opus 8, B Major and Opus 87, C Major, were played with jarring tempo changes, unintuitive and displeasing phrasing, and a seeming lack of interest. I am a huge fan (and player) of Brahms and these trios in particular, and it was astonishing to discover that this compilation's recordings were so lacking in feeling and grace."
1,Very disappointed customer,"""I waited a long time for my movie and then when I did receive the item it was the wrong movie I'm a very disappointed customer"""
3,insane price,while the movies were good what about this screams 500 have the sellers lost their minds.
3,Great Recorder - But Fails to Play many Commercial DVDs,"Record mode works great - but I have over FIVE ""Area 1"" commercial DVD's that won't play on this unit. I KEPT my old Sony combo DVD/VCR unit - it has no issues at all with these 5 DVDs. Each of these is listed as a ""Dual Layer"" Type 9 DVD (all Disney releases).My conclusion? Get the unit if you want to RECORD. But first? Go out & buy a cheap DVD player for playing commercial releases. I had the SAME ISSUE with a Panasonic unit. These DVD recorders seem to have a major problem playing commercial DVDs."
2,the ability to pause during recording?,"Am I missing something, or does this unit NOT allow you to pause during a recording? When I try to use the pause button during recording (using DVD-R to record a program), a message pops up saying ""That function prohibited during record mode."" And when I check the user manual, the only thing it says regarding the ""Pause"" button on the remote is that it is used to ""pause during playback."" A recorder with NO PAUSE feature for editing on the fly? What if you want to edit commercials while recording? What if you're dubbing from home videos and you want to pause to edit out unwanted segments? Seems to me that's either really bad design or a rather remarkable oversight."
5,THE BEST DVD RECORDER I'VE EVER HAD,I HAVE HAD ANOTHER SONY IN THE PAST AND WAS NOT SURE THAT I WANTED ANOTHER. THIS ONE WAS RECOMMENDED AND I'M GLAD I PURCHASED IT. NOT ONE 'DIRTY' DVD YET. SUPER!
2,Pretty upsetting DVD recorder,"I recently purchased this DVD recorder from Best Buy. It was an open item so I got it for a good deal. Initially after I set it up I was pretty happy, after I started watching tv and recorded a show, I realized I got a piece of junk on my shelf.It looks good and the hardware is high quality. But here are the bad points.1. It takes a very long time for the recorder to turn on, and almost 15 seconds to eject a DVD.2. The display that says what show is on and what channel it is reappears every 5 seconds.3. I recorded 24 last night, and tried to watch it later. While it says in the manual and I know that some programs are copy protected, 24 was protected for almost 70% of the show. It wasn't normal increments either. It was totally random. Most of the show was cut out, and I just saw a grey blank screen.Overall, I was extremely frustrated with this dvd recorder. Its possible it was just a bad unit but regardless I just went and exchanged it for the Panasonic DMR- ES15."
1,"Avoid - Stuck on ""Welcome"" - should have been recalled","I see ""Welcome"" on the RDR GX330 front display, it's stuck! This remains, even after repeated power-cycling and various power-cycle and button pressing options suggested in the manual... This product should have been recalled instead of being deeply discounted for the unsuspecting consumers; it is an embarrassment for SONY. I have noticed that Sony's North America service centers do not list DVD players among the items that they will service.On the positive side, my unit lasted twice as long as others reported here - nearly four years before becoming a brick. This was a reasonable system while it lasted. The only other previous problem was that it often took minutes to reach the disc menu when powered on."
1,ARF,"It is a useless unit!Few months after warranty ran out, my RDR-GX330 is stuck on ""WELCOME"".Do not waste your money."
1,No pause is ignorant!,Sony makes the ONLY DVD recorder in the world that you can't pause while recording. That's just plain stupid. Remind me never to buy Sony again. I'd give it zero stars if I could.
5,We wanted a better DVD recorder and we got it!!!,"We wanted a Sony so that the remote would be compatible with our Sony TV, we also wanted to replace our cheap unredictable cyberhome recorder. We are very pleased with our product choice, I always read the reviews posted by amazon purchasers and they are very helpful in enablling me to make informed purchases."
5,I like this recorder,"I have always been pleased with Sony products. This DVD recorder is no exception. It took about 20 minutes to connect the recorder to the TV. The automatic set up was great--the recorder finds the correct time itself and all the channels that have a signal.Setting the timer for recording is straight forward and intuitive. So far, no negatives at all."
1,"My RDR-GX330 also is stuck on ""welcome"" after 22 months of use","I was very pleased with unit until a few weeks ago when it suddently stopped working and only displays ""welcome"" even afte being turned off, etc. This appears to be a relatively common problem, based on several other Amazon reviews, which I think Sony should repair even after the original 12 month original warranty has expired. I really liked the i-Link functionalty that allowed me to insert time marks on my Sony digital camcorder to control what was recorded on the DVD recorder, as well as, the order in which the segments were recorded."
1,PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BUY!!!!,"This machine cannot pause while in the record mode. What a joke, Sony. Buy a Philips machine, you will be much happier"
2,Short On Critical Features,"The Sony RDR-GX330 provides good picture quality, but sound is lacking.It has no fiber optic output for playback in 5.1 sound. There is a digital coaxil output for 5.1 sound, but I haven't got it work yet. All of my sound so far has been in simple stereo. Another problem this recorder has is no pause while in record mode. I think I will take it back."
1,Who said Sony are Quality ?,"Re The Sony DVD GX Series DVD RecordersI would just like to say that I have one of these DVD Recorders and it is rubbish. Not ony did I have to send one back because the Record Mode would not record what I had set it to, but also because it lacks so many features that the list of non features is far greater than its list of ones it does have.A) As is already commented on, There is No Pause whilst recording.(B) No Thumbnail replacement(C) Poor picture quality(D) No Delete of Part of recording for cutting out Adverts - only A - B delete - not the same, and this not work when played back on another brand of DVD Recorder.(E) Buttons on the Remote too small.(F) Title Thumbnails do not appear when played back on a Philips machine.(G) Will not play back JPEGs(G) This recorder is very poorly priced for what you get, a lot of much cheaper ones have more featuresThere are other issues. My advice do not buy a Sony"
2,Worked Great for a Year,"This was a great DVD recorder for a year. After 1 year the ""welcome"" message came on and never went back off. Even after unplugging it for days it still wouldn't go off after I plugged it back in. No buttons worked even the power button didn't work. I called Sony and they told me it would need to be repaired by shipping it to a service center thousands of miles away. On my dime of course. Funny thing is this unit died just months after the warranty expired.It's junk. Don't buy it."
3,Disappointing product,"I was in the market for a dvd recorder. I thought best to get a sony for peace of mind about reliability. I got one from bestbuy. The S-video did not work from the back input. I wanted to use this feature. So I returned the unit and got a similar exchange. It has the same defect, in addition the back fan was running all the time and very noisy. On the positive side, the picture recording was very clear. So I returned the unit and got a panasonic. Just can't believe sony ship products without fully testing all functionality."
1,Sony hasn't yet responded to its customers,Thought you'd all like to know that the newest vintage of Sony recorders hasn't yet changed any of its shortcomings. The RDR-GXD -455 still records well but the disk can't be played even on a high-end Sony DVD player. This is as of October 2007.
4,"Takes a long time to eject discs when off, and to play when inserting a new disc","If you buy this DVD player/recorder, just be aware that if your player is off and you want to get a disc out, you are going to wait nearly 30 seconds for it to turn on, boot up, and finally eject the disc. When it is on and you insert a disc it takes approximately 15 seconds to start playing. You may say, ""big deal, It makes a good recorder."" I would agree, but since ejecting and inserting/playing discs are the operations I do 90% of the time, this is a real annoyance. I had a really cheap DVD player that didn't make me wait at all, so I guess I was used to instant response. This one takes its time to respond, but I imagine it has to do with the fact that it also supports so many different formats.I have enjoyed how well it records discs however."
2,tough so far,"Well I've tried a few times to get into this CD, I give artists ...I guess leeway might be the word to grow and change. But from there forst CD to this is a very tough swallow to take. I don't notice the wonderful groove that I dig from the first few albums, perhaps after a few more times listening...I would not bother with getting this CD. Stop with the the other 3. Heal, which took a few times through to get, but it is pretty good.All this Everything, after the 2nd time listening to it I was hooked.Sweet Oblivion, Just Amazing from the 1st track!"
3,"Go Back To The ProgJam Creative ""Groove""","This recent CD is totally disappointing. They lost their ""groove"" here. Quite frankly, on this new release, they sound like the now faded band from Colorado called ""The Samples"". They have to decide whether they want to be a very appealing Progressive Jam Band, or just another band with no targeted direction. Sorry, but they missed the boat here, after two very excellent previous releases. Hope their manager gets them back on track!"
3,Fair Read,"This is a mildly diverting book, and the characters are interesting enough. But the some of the plot contrivances -- especially the hero's actions when he was younger, when he left the country for two years without a word to the woman he'd fallen in love with -- simply don't ring true, and these detract from the rest of the book. That said, the characters are diverting, if unexpected by Regency standards."
4,good deal,"just received my son's violin, kind of what i anticipated, did not give any instructions on how to install bridge and found out that it is a generic bridge that does not fit with sting placements. other than that it is a fine investment."
2,I bought a movie from overseas...,"I finally found the movie I had seen on the TV as a child, Harem. I was so phsyched that I'd get to see it that I purchased it right away. I also received it sooner than I had originally expected, but when I opened the DVD & put it in the player, I got a disk error & so I checked it a couple of times. Then I mailed it back to the seller. I got a couple of emails before I sent the video back & haven't heard another word about it. I'm still waiting for either a refund or a copy of the movie without a disk error. I think I'd prefer the movie."
2,Match Point...... Hmm More Like A Back Spin,"This is hard pill to digest. While this is somewhat of an intriguing story, the acting falls flat. Scarlett Johansson, who is a beautiful woman, was so not convincing in this movie. In fact, her character was the of the worst in the film. The lead actor, Jonathan Rhys Myers was a close second. The opera-tennis combo theme (which was odd to say the least) did nothing for the story. After the first 30 minutes, all tennis playing was over. The operas and opera music was far too stylish for such a bland group of actors. None of them captured the sleek, seductive, and risky behavior their characters displayed. There was also a substantial amount of predictability in the slow moving plot (Infidelity, lust, murder, wealth, etc. - seems like it's been done before, only better). The only thing that saves this movie is the anticipation to know the ending, but that too seemed to be lacking."
2,Falls apart at the end...,"This film was ruined once it became a ""thriller"" due to two reasons:1. Shotguns make a very, very loud noise.2. The actions (and inactions) of the police were totally unbelievable.If you can overlook these major plot holes, you might enjoy this. We didn't."
3,mostly a waste of time,"There was a time, in the 1970s, when the mostly fatuous characters in ""Match Point"" may have seemed interesting, but like the 70s, that time has passed. The problem is no one has told Woody Allen. This film is mostly a rehash of the ideas and scenes from Woody's earlier films, and if you've seen them, then this one isn't worth your time."
2,The critics were so wrong!!,"This was by far one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. Most of the audience began walking out before the movie was over and the remaining audience stood up as soon as the credits began to roll - it was as if they could not wait until it was over. I kept trying to convince my companion that the good part was coming - but it never arrived.While it was not necessarily predictable, it wasn't that complex either - there was either option A or option B and there was nothing about the character that made you care one way or another. I would not recommend this movie. Wait until it shows up on cable!"
5,Match Point,This movie came in great condition In good speed. We love this movie so in all it was a great experience using this seller.
3,"I love Woody Allen, but,,,,,,,,.","I really like Woody Allen, particularly when he sticks to what he does best, namely writing comedy. His most recent endeavor aptly titled "" Match Point "" was a good attempt to prove to the audience that he is quite capeable of writing drama/thriller movies too. Sadly his efforts, though noble , proves that he isn't a good writer of drama nor thriller. The script sounded unnatural and forced. The acting was poor all the way around. It felt as if the actors were just going through the motions. The editing was very bad and choppy. There were so many scenes that should have been deleted from the movie. The movie jumped around too much. On top of it at the end of many scenes there would be a pause as if the director decided to yell "" cut "" too late. It was uncomfortable to watch. I think it is ok to see this movie but only once."
1,Dreadful. Did Soon-Yi direct this?,"Woody rips off his own ideas (the brilliant Crimes and Misdemeanours) and patronises viewers with a chocolate box London and some of the worst dialogue ever (Mother, don't you know that is her archille's heel emotionally?). Bumbling police, contrived coincidences and a whiny Scarlet Johannsen add up to one tedious film."
2,An American Tragedy meets Crime and Punishment,"Execellent photography and scenes. Mediocre content.This story line transparently mimics Dreiser's American Tragedy as rewritten and released by Hollywood in 1951 as A Place in the Sun. Allen mocks the perpetual struggle between good and evil in the bewildering conscience-absolving comparison to good luck and bad. Do the gods punish the act? The intent? Or leave all to chance?PS: Re the casting. I do prefer Scarlett for believable sizzle rather than Shelley Winters in the 1951 edition, though Shelley the actress by herself to this day outshines any of these characters."
4,Simply enjoyable,"Matchpoint was recommended by an esteemed gentleman with such enthusiasm over a film I haven't heard in years. After driving hundreds of miles I rushed to purchase the dvd as soon as I pulled into town. Holding more grip than the bowl of Nascar space grits I had enjoyed that morning, Woody Allen kept me pensive and gooey eyed to swim beyond 'cliche, cliche, cliche - twist'. The film is honest. The characters do not endure extraordinary circumstance excepting only the superficial drapings of thier societal roles. The lead faces critical consequence of a moral audience in that he portrays the villain to the masses by way of mad frenzy to feed the flesh and have all. To some unfortunately, this representation will resonate like roaches in pants. A film worthwhile."
1,A homeless man's Hitchcock,a horrible adaptation of Dostoevsky's Crime & Punishment; Woody is a homeless man's Hitchcock at best. this film suffers from its objectification of Scarlett Johansson from beginning to end.
1,brain-dead special,"It may be interesting only for a truly brain-dead: it is so boring, predictable and moronic. There are thousands of stories like this published since 19th century and this one did not add anything new.And on top of it, why would one make both Scarlet Johansson and Emily Mortimer to look so annoyingly ugly?"
1,"Sorry, not my thing",I do not enjoy garbage. I must confess I did not watch this through. In order to know it would go no further I destroyed it. My fault for reading a review in a newspaper.
1,Sickening celebration of nihilism,"Woody Allen should be in a prison somewhere. Watching this movie was one of the most morally soiling cinematic experiences of my life.The main character is about as evil as they come. He marries for money, then starts a needless affair with a beautiful blonde, gets her pregnant, and when she acts as almost any woman would act under the circumstances, he murders her. In the process, he also murders her totally innocent neighbor to make it look like a drug rampage. And he gets away with it. And the movie manipulates us to root for him as he does all of this. I was so angry after I watched this that I was almost beside myself.As I say, Allen should be in prison, not making movies."
3,"been there, done that","Hasn't anyone noticed that this movie is just ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" in London? Woody Allen already explored the fact that bad people get away with crimes and their consciences adjust. In this newest venture he packages it as ""it is better to be lucky than good."" The nod to Dostoevsky in this one is not even subtle - the character is reading Crime and Punishment right on screen. It is obvious that Woody Allen has discovered the rich get away with murder, but how many times does the audience have to be dragged through it:?"
2,I have read this before...,"While watched the movie could not escape the thought that once before the sequence of the same events was captured by Theodore Dreiser in ""An American Tragedy"""
2,Slow and Tedious,"This is the type of movie that gives heterosexuals a bad name. Rhys-Myers, I have decided is only capable of simluating sex. Whether here or in the Tudors it's pretty much the same. And Miss Scarlet (and of course the terminally neurotic Allen) seem to think that whenever in the throes of an orgasm it is always better to have a cigarette in your face and be madly blowing smoke at your partner. No single character deserves empathy. they are all scumbags in every sense of the word and as soon as the movie is over (If we can call it an ending) we don't really care what happens to any of them. Pick somethin' wlse."
3,"Lacking Allen's usual ""staying"" power","After just recently being drawn in by Woody Allen classic like ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and ""Annie Hall,"" I went into Match Point expecting great things. I may have overshot a little. With great casting, solid performances, and interesting characters I was somehow unsure how I left the theater feeling somewhat cheated.That is, until I realized that I didn't feel challenged by Allen to examine morality or human relationships as I have been in the past. The ""surprise"" ending was unexpected, yes, but was lacking believability as well as purpose.I do suggest seeing it for yourself, but I think you will feel the ""senselessness"" of the final scene."
4,Not quite 'Crimes and Misdemeanors',"Intelligent, tense, frosty drama with thriller overtones. It's very good, but three things hold it back from being flat out terrific: 1) Scarlett Johanssen is fair in a role that needed somebody great. She's sexy all right, but there's a necessary layer of complexity missing. 2) There are some big logic holes in the last 1/3 that rely on us buying a lot of coincidence and 3) Allen has basically already made the same film much more deeply and inventively in Crimes and Misdemeanors. Still, in a vacuum, one of the better films of 2005"
2,"utterly uninteresting and lifeless, worse than a mere repeat","Alas, I bought this and felt obligated to sit through it. This is almost the exact same plot as ""crimes and misdemeanors"" - sex, infidelity, and expedient murder to save an empty homelife - but it is flat, humorless, and has no intriguing or sympathetic characters; one of the great delights in earlier Allen films were the character-based asides, vivid glmipses into (largely new yorkish) lives, but they are absent from this film. Allen also is out of place in England, which is a very different society than the US, and his portrayal of its elite has no depth beyond well-trod formulas of priviledge based on hard work. Finally, the acting is wooden and unsubtle, very disappointing. I think this is the worst film by Allen I have ever seen.Not recommended."
2,It's an Improvement Over Allen's Comedies.,"While my title is true, it's still as overrated by the critics as all his irritatingly bad comic flicks. It wasn't boring, and I found the plot engaging enough. The trouble? You could see the ending coming a mile away, and the more the story went on, the more despicable Johnathan Rhys Meyers' character Chris became. Maybe this was a comedy, because Allen actually expects people too root for someone this shallow and evil? Another case in point is that the police working on the murder of his mistress Nola (Scarlett Johansson) and the poor, innocent lady downstairs conducted the sloppiest detective work since Jon Bonet Ramsey. The girl at the boutique who knew about Nola seeing Chris, and the man he banged into on the street after committing the crime were never questioned? Worst of all is the ending. If Woody Allen is morally depraved enough to glorify unpunished murderers, let him, but as far as this viewer is concerned his loyal fans of his can have him."
3,Great Looking but Full of Holes,"What are the chances:That a nouveau riche British family with upper class pretentions would take so readily to a working class Irish tennis instructor?That said family would all share tennis instructor's bogus love of the opera?That the daughter of said family would fall almost immediately in love with said tennis instructor?That members of said family father's firm would immediately take to the intrusion of tennis instructor with no business background at all into their workplace rather than resenting him terribly and treating him venomously?That all the reviewers would miss the VERY long and broad Scotland Yard joke near the end? [Hint: Its real name is Metropolitan Police Service, and it has nothing to do with Scotland.]"
1,Very Slow Moving,It moved so slowly I almost turned it off a couple of times. The ending is terrible. Save your money.
2,Just what the world needed: a Woody Allen movie without a single laugh in it...,"This is a tale of affairs and lies, good luck and bad, lethal consequences and the lack of consequences. One more in what seems like an endless string of Hollywood films promoting adultery, trivializing marriage, and rewarding the immoral, the dishonest and the shallow. The acting is fine, the sex scenes are hot, but the film overall is cold and ugly."
1,Boring-typical Allen,My god this a boring boring film. I still have no idea why Allen's film are well liked. He is a boring director and a boring writer. Do not waste your time on this waste of film.
2,Never gets up to speed.,"With a fondness of slow, classic style thrillers and the critical and consumer acclaim I'd seen I was looking forward to Match Point. The ""high class"" backdrop, tennis parallels and allure of Johansson at the center or a romantic tangle all pointed to an intriguing ride.But the plot pace is glacial even for me, the story predictable and the themes and characters inconsistent. The tennis touches are largely forgotten a third of the way in, Jonhansson's character develops unevenly and in jumps, and there are several glaring plot holes as things progress. There was some question as to how things would end, but by then most of my interest had fled and the resolution was flat regardless.I am not very familiar with the works of Woody Allen and thus could not compare this with his other films. If that's part of the appeal I could be missing something, but overall for me Match Point unfortunately turned out rather disappointing."
3,"An Amoral Remake of Dreiser's ""American Tragedy""","The story has been remade by Hollywood probably a half-dozen times: Ambitious and poor young man torn between the girl who is his ticket to wealth and privilege, and the girl he loves but whom he comes to see as standing between him and material success. Well made but utterly hollow, the characters are wooden cartoons of social types. There are the children of privilege and their parents, all blissfully unaware of any suffering in the world, whose lives revolve around lunch, shooting, the theatre and Greek island-hopping. And there are the outsiders, beautiful but penniless, equally self-centered. But the third act still had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see how the protagonist will act and what will become of him."
5,"This is a smart, sexy thriller!","I loved this movie. Strangely enough I am not a fan of Woody Allen's movies. However, this movie just has a very different feel to it. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Scarlett Johannson smolder on the screen with such amazing chemistry. All the acting is superb. I particularly loved the posh English personalities so well done. This movie is one to talk about afterward and definately not cliche. The only negative thing about this movie is the lack of extras, or really no DVD extras. I was disappointed about that because right after the movie I quickly brought up the disc menu to view deleted scenes or commentary and unfortunately there was nothing of the sort. All in all I highly recommend this movie."
2,A trivialization of Crimes and Misdemeanors,"Woody has done it again. And again and again. Meaning that he has once more copied himself. All the moral issues depicted in this movie were already in Crimes and Misdemeanors (CM), which truly is one of his best movies and was also much deeper and much better acted. This movie is just CM in London, without its moral depth, its great script and its great actors. Allen is just re-doing himself with better-looking actors. The use of soundtrack in Match Point is the only really redeeming feature of this point. The observation that small random events can affect our lives in important ways is certainly true but is hardly new and not so well exploited here. The best thing of this movie probably remain Scarlet Johansson."
2,A disappointment,"This one is supposed to be a psychological sexy thriller.... I think. It drags from the start and the director (I suppose he's the culprit) vainly attempts to mislead and eventually surprise the viewer at the outset with a tennis ball which hits the top of the net (ergo, the match point theme), and later, linking this little caveat to a wedding ring of a murdered girl which hits a railing (ZZzzzzzzzzz.......). Anyway, it's all about an immoral tennis instructor who gets himself into a menage-a-trois of sorts, and whom chooses murder (shocking!) as a resolution to his love problems (and his financial ones too). If you use cinema as a means of battling insomnia, and you need some background noise in order to nap, this one might work for you. If you're really into ""sexual tension"" I suppose it's possible that you might like this movie but I certainly cannot recommend it."
3,"Good, but ........still flawed.","Jonathan Rhys Meyers is terrific. I first watched him in ""Gormenghast"" on PBS several years ago. His performance as the power-thirst kitchen boy was unforgettable. He is so good at portraying a demented, obsessive or possessed character. This film is worth watching. But, I have a major offense against the ending of the film. When there was a crime such as murder occurred, shouldn't the investigation started by performing an autopsy on the victim's body. If the police had done so, they would have discovered the REAL motive for the murder. It just seemed so implausible unless British policemen are always doing such a clumsy job. Well, overall, I still think this film has its qualities."
2,"Inane Dialog, Terribly Predictable Plot","The only thing that saves this film from a zero or one-star rating is the cast. The screenplay on this thing is, to say the least, clunky. Some of the dialog is barely palatable and I don't know how the actors managed to wrap their tongues around it without laughing out loud. The set-up for Chris's ""perfect crime"" is blatant: ""The woman down the hall had a burglery earlier..."" and, since it's Woody Allen, you KNOW he's going to get away with it."
3,"Lightly engaging, but also tedious","I have mixed feelings about this movie. On one hand, I enjoyed the characters and the acting was good. But on the other, the story is nothing new and it made me squirm in my seat. Meyers plays a tennis pro who falls in love with a lovely, but naive, British aristocrat played by Emily Mortimer. They marry and Meyers gets a cushy job working for his father-in-law. Of course he risks it all by having an affair with Johansson's character. The movie was good enough to get me to care about Meyers-I found myself hoping he would not get caught. But the movie really didn't have anything new to say. At least it didn't have the typical happy Hollywood ending. If about 15 minutes were shaved off, I would probably have given it 4 stars."
2,Why can't he just stop?,"WHY is Woody Allen still making movies? He must be making them on autopilot. Once again, we have a group of youngish yuppies with no money or health problems, eating out in stylish restaurants. Once again, at least one of them is committing adultery. Once again, the background is a pretty travelogue (London, this time). And the plot is the same as it was in Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors. The pace drags and drags, and finally it's over."
1,Horrible waste of time for both actors,"I feel so strongly about this movie I had to review it. I love both main actors, and have loved them in everything they're been in. This movie made me like them less. I think the characters were supposed to be unlikable, but if that's the case, why am I watching a movie about two people I don't like? The story might have been interesting had I cared what happened to either of them."
2,Just switched off,"Gave this film 30 minutes to grab my attention and then gave up. None of the characters were believeable or likeable. The ""irish"" guy sounded like he was born and bred in Surrey. The dialogue was lame.It's a long time since I found so little merit in a film."
1,Wake me when there is signs of life,"So Woody directed this ""movie""?, what a waste!, sooooo slooooow!, sooooo booooring!, excuse me, I've got to watch some paint dry."
3,movie FIVE STARS dvd extras ZERO STARS=3 STARS,"First Off, LOVED THE FILM, By Far The BEST Film Woody Allen has every made and I actually dont like Woody Allen Movies! The Movie has it all MYSTERY, SUSPENSE and SEX! Now on to the BAD NEWS! Where are the DVD EXTRAS??? I cannot believe that Woody Allen is releasing this film without any Trailiers, Director Commentary, making of Featurette, or Interviews with the Cast! I was going to buy the DVD until I found out that this is a BARE BONES EDITION! It really pisses me off that Studios release a DVD without extras ONLY to release the SPECIAL EDITION, DIRECTORS CUT, UNCUT, 10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION, 20TH ANNIVERSARY years later or in the case of CRASH 6 months later. They release a bare bones edition of crash in sept 2005 ONLY to later release a directors cut 6 MONTHS LATER? My Point is, for people think of buying matchpoint, WAIT! I am sure that woody a year from now or sooner will release a specail edition, DONT BE DUPED!"
1,Worst 2+ Hours Ever Spent in a Theater,"Hated it. Too bad zero stars isn't an option. Dark. Sooooo NOT funny. And the worst part was, in Woody Allen fashion, the movie dragged in EVERY scene as we were forced to tag along the no-where lives of the characters involved."
3,I knew Woody was a pessimist but Jessssuuuusss!,"Seriously! This is a dark flick, nothing funny about it. Good though! Scarlett johansson's got some nice ones ;) who on earth would want to unload shot gun shells into those!"
3,Not that good,"I can't understand why some have awarded this movie five stars - it's simply not that good. The movie falls into two distinct parts, joined together by the theme of the importance of luck. The first half sets the scene well, though Allen's tenuous grasp on dramatic continuity is annoying (e.g. Chris and Nola make passionate love in a field in the pouring rain, end of scene, no mention of their reception when they go back indoors). The second half (from Nola's discovery that she is pregnant) is truly dreadful - but credit to Scarlett Johansson for being irresistible in part one and the total opposite in part two. I was glad when it was over."
5,Lust or Love? Which is it in this passionate story with a British twist?,"Jonathan Rhys-Myers and Scarlett Johansson star in this smoldering story of lust, desire, and wealth. Chris, played by Rhys-Myers,is a tennis pro scraping out a living giving lessons, when he meets the son of a wealthy British family and develops a romance with his sister, Chloe, played by Emily Mortimer. Graciously accepted by the family, he becomes engaged to Chloe and is offered a lucrative position within the family's corporation.Enter Nola, played by Scarlett Johannson, the sensuous American wannabe-actress involved with Chloe's brother, and the fireworks begin. Defined by dramatic opera arias that form the backdrop of the story, passion erupts between Chris and Nola in spite of the fact that Chris is now married to Chloe and living the kind of life that only money can buy.Intense, brilliant drama written by Woody Allen that kept me on the edge of my seat!"
3,A Place In The Sun Re-Deux,"I'm not an Allen fan but I'm a huge fan of Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and I had wanted to see this movie for a long time.I was completely surprised by it because I expected to see an orignal screen play not a re-make of a movie that was made in the early 1950's with a young Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift - A Place In The Sun. Both movies are good however, A Place In The Sun is excellent.I had the same experience when I watched and thoroughly enjoyed Sharkey's Machine with Burt Reynolds. Its an action packed, macho as only Burt can be remake of Laura with Gene Tierney from the 1940's.I didn't find this movie thought provoking as much as I found that it had tried too hard to be unsettling."
3,"Interesting, but too much time wasted","Takes too long to get going, and can be frustrating in the process. However, once it does get going, it pulls you in and you cannot stop watching. A very strange movie about a man who cheats on his wife, but then realises what he has is much better than an affair. His lover becomes a problem and she must be dealt with. Woody Allen attempts a Hitchcock style and it almost works. What I didnt like was the fact that Jonathan Reese Myers is supposed to be a hearthrob, but he is too skinny and weedy in real life."
3,Been there-Seen that,"Why all the hoopla for this film? Match Point is a re-packaged Crimes and Misdemeanors. Crimes and Misdemeanors, however, was a brilliant film more multi-layered, with more complex characterizations and containing the irony and wit of which Match Point is totally devoid. The plot and conflicts are universally recognizable but were drawn to better effect in many classic films of which A Place in the Sun comes to mind. In Match Point the iconography of Manhattan has been substituted for an idealized London; the social divides in both cities are the same, only the buildings and street names have been changed. The actors' performances are serviceable to the plot; no real acting ""wows"" here. Woody Allen is probably one of the most literate filmmakers of any period in film history, yet Match Point adds nothing to enhance his catalogue of work. The movie is worth seeing; it's just not as good as its cracked up to be."
3,Not a comedy by Woody Allen,"Woody Allen, known more for his comedies, tries his hand at a crime drama here. However, some parts of the movie are not as believable as they could be. For example, in this age of DNA testing where even a hair is enough to tie a criminal to a murder, how the police don't find anything that makes Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) culpable to the crime is implausible. Moreover, Wilton's decision to kill Nola (Scarlett Johansson) comes as a bit drastic and extreme to the viewer. And a drug addict killing an old woman for a just a few medications in her bathroom cabinet is improbable. The movie is sprinkled with analogies to tennis which are good, but that's not good enough to give it more than 3 stars."
1,Deceptively charming cover,Withing the first chapter or two the lurid sexual references kept me from reading any farther. I was truly disgusted. This is truly a male adventure only. I want to burn it so no one else will be drug down with its pages.
3,The far kingdoms is a little confusing at the very end,The book gets quickly to the plot and sticks to it. A young man must go on a journey to discover a trade route so he picks to try to discover the far kingdoms. He has a few problems along the way and if he gets there (which you will have to find out for yourself)he might haave a disaster and a love to get him thruogh it.
4,Great controller,"I've this controller for about a year now. I got it so me and my brother could play soul calibur together and it's held up well. I haven't had any problems with the buttons sticking or anything like that. My only complaint is that the analog stick doesn't have a pad on it so the little bumps on it can irratate ur thumb after a while and when my brother dropped it, part of the top of the analog stick broke off. I think maybe if a a pad was on it like the psx/2/3 controllers maybe this wouldn't have happened. Other than that I love this controller. Hasn't let me down yet."
2,Thinning out,"2 1/2There's something unique on the artsy rockabilly with ranging influences, but way too many tracks that don't seem to cash in on an initial premise."
1,Wrong item received,Wrong item received - could not find the ISBN number in detail when sender asked me to recheck. His e-mail stating this was after item had already been shipped. I originally ordered by the ISBN number for Edition 9. What I received was Edition 4 (I believe).This was a text book for a school class so I then purchased this book from the college bookstore.I most likely missed some instructions on your site as I thought that I was ordering the book having the ISBN that I had listed
3,Ditto!,"I suppose it's hardly worth it to write a review when I agree with everything the former reviewer said...but just for those who want a second opinion, he's absolutely right. If you want animation lessons, look elsewhere.But it's rather interesting to have a look through."
4,Devil's Bridge,"This is a good book and I had fun reading it. But there were some parts that I didn't understand, like what Mercury was. The rest of the book was really great. All the parts about all the fish got me really excited(I even asked my mom to take me fishing). I learned alot about new kinds of fish, new ways how to fish and many new different kinds of bait and lures. This is a good book for kids and grownups that are into fishing."
4,review of devils bridge,this is a good book about a boy that likes to go fishing in the ocean and he earns money to enter a fishing contest.
5,Amazing,I had them before I and I bought it again because I abused them one time and I damage one of them.This set are the best
1,trust the others,I got this reading that it was dull but figured I could just sharpen on the hone/whetstone I use for my straight razor. After spending a long time doing this it still would not work and I just ruined a 40 dollar piece of acrylic... Save the money and get some scrap metal from a dumpster.
1,Better off using an axe...,"I bought this at Home Depot when I picked up a sheet of acrylic. I wish I hadn't. This thing is useless and it ended up ruining the piece of acrylic. You really would be better off just using an axe to cut with...or get the OLFA cutter...it works much, much, MUCH better."
3,Be aware,this item just cuts a small thickness of plexiglass and this is an assumption. I broke my window project and had to do a homemade makeover to cover the window. It's sharp just not very well spec detailed.
2,Where's the beef?,"I had now purchased both of the available MOM books, both seem to cover roughly the same material, but neither really has any meat to it! I would have given this 3 stars, but unfortunately, the author makes a boring topic even more boring."
4,Essential Microsoft Operations Manager,"Well written, supply the technical information needed. Little long prolog but in the end well written and easy readable."
5,loved this cd,awesome cd. I loved the songs and the quality of the cd. . the arrangements were put together very well
5,Release your inner origami designer,"The designs in this book are deceptively simple. What this book did for me that no other origami book has done was stimulate me into creating my own origami designs.If what you want is someone else's harder and harder designs to merely reproduce, this book will disappoint you. You won't find a compendium of unique, obscure, challenging designs in this book, but if you are ready to find them inside yourself, this book may help guide your discovery. Absolutely the best book for beginning folders, and the only book for beginning origami designers I've ever seen."
5,Great buy,Easy to follow instructions.Simple diagrams that go step by step.If you want to learn how to do a few figures this is a great book.asdf jkl; qwer uiop
3,"Good for children and beginners, but very short","This is a pretty short basic origami book. It has simplemodels that are fairly well illustrated. It's geared more towardschildren or for classroom use. Frankly, I felt ripped off taking this book out of the library. There are better uses of your origami dollars. I could see this, along with a pack of paper, making a nice gift for a child. I would definitely not buy it for someone past 12."
1,thumbs down,this book is good for giving instruction on the different forms of folds but the illistrations and diagrams are were this book lacks. the diagrams are there but there is only one or two explinations of the different steps. I find it very hard to follow instructions when all I see is a picture telling me to do something and I don't have an explination. so I say if your in need of learning how to make certain folds then by all means use this book but using it to learn how to make an item is very difficult and I don't recomend this book.
1,Double Vision,What looks like a cute idea turns out to be a big headache. The binoculars are difficult to see through. You constantly struggle with double vision in both the binoculars and viewmaster. And it's hard for younger ones to keep it in one mode without accidentally hitting the switch.
5,Elsa loves it.,"Bought this for our granddaughter's third birthday. She is into everything Dora, so this had quite a bit of positive emotional equity going for it. She loves it, but probably uses the View Master option more than the binoculars. That said, she has had a great time watching backyard squirrels with the binoculars.It is NOT a toy that you hand to small children and tell them to go play with it. It takes some instruction and supervision; given that, it combines the attraction that View Master has enjoyed for decades along with the wonder of binoculars. Great educational toy."
2,interesting to watch,A little confusing with snipits that don't really make that much sense. Read the synopsis first to get what this movie is about. A good period movie which tells the true story about a Czech girl who fought for the resistance.
1,Don't buy,"I used a bag of Scotts (Sun and Shade) and a left over bag of Pennington's. I used the Penningtons in one section of my lawn and the Scott's in a another. The Scotts was actually paired with Peat Moss as an added bonus. One week later the Pennington section is beautiful and the Scotts is sparse. 50% of the Scotts seed didn't even grow. Both sections were within 10 feet apart. Same sun/shade, drainage all things were equal. There is no reason the Scotts should of performed so poorly. It is definately an inferior product. I'm sticking with the Pennington line of products in the future. I am very dissapointed in Scotts."
1,Bad seeds,"Wouldn't recommend the seeds to anyone, followed all the instuctions and all I got was weeds on using the seeds. Wasted lot of money in buying the junk product."
1,Total Waste of money,"I bought a large and expensive bad of this seed, and I kept it watered and moist. The result? Not a single shoot came up. Thanks Scotts. no more business for you."
2,Barely any grass!,"Thought this product was going to be revolutionary, but it was simply the worst grass seed I've ever planted! I compared two lawn areas, one with seed from a local nursery, and the Scott's brand in another. The Scott's brand barely grew, and the soil was kept moist with mixed in starter fertilizer. I agree with another reviewer that their covered seeds are a real problem.Sorry, but I have officially left the Scott's brand of seed...what a shame that such a reputable company put out such a poor product."
1,did not germinate,"This coated seed did not sprout! I have wasted time and money. I have used Scotts regular seeds before without a problem. But, now, I will no longer buy Scotts."
1,Very disappointed,I planted Scotts Sun and Shade Turf builder over a week ago and nothing has come up at all. Today I was inspecting the grass kernels and noticed that just about everyone that I picked up was an empty shell. I was perplexed. Then I looked at the seed left in the bag and inspected that. More empty shells covered in some kind of coating. Quite a waste of time and money.
1,very bad product,i purchased this product from my local store(not amazon). I am a gardener and have grown grass many times over the years but not one seed of this stuff has come up and it has been 3 weeks. It is lost money and most important my energy and time. Last year i used a generic grass seed from a bin at local store and it grew just fine. Tomorrow i go and buy more of the generic. I normally do not buy any Scott products and when i purchased this bag of grass seed i forgot why that is. Buy another brand like Pennington which i have used many times successfully in the past.
4,Like the seed coating.,"The seed coating is white which is very good to see how homogeneous and how much you spread them. These seeds came out nicely. However, Amazon charged more than the local stores, like Walmart and Lowe's."
4,Ok product but not the best.,"I purchased 2 bags of this along with an equal amount of seed from a nearby garden center. While the Scotts seed germinated in the time it stated on the bag, however that was 2-3 times slower than the seed from the garden center, the garden center seed was also is far greener."
2,Not as great as the pic,This ring is a lot prettier on the screen that when you actually receive it.
2,Poor Image Qualtiy,"At first glance, this seemed like a good camera at an affordable price. Branded Polaroid, it was expected that this camera be of exceptional quality. After taking a few pictures at each quality level at 1280x960 and 640x480, I viewed them on my computer and saw that the image quality was just horrendous; even at highest quality (lowest compression), the image was not very clear. The LCD doesn't even show a preview shot as you must rely on the optical viewfinder window.I guess for the price, I would rate this camera as OK for casual use. Anyone looking for a camera that takes clear pictures should look elsewhere."
5,First Hand Account of a Unique Experience,"Marty Stanton has the ability to spin a fascinating story. Before the first Gulf War, he was assigned to a one of a kind military organization, quite unlike anything which most career soldiers will ever experience. The opportunities that assignment gave him for travel and interaction with the locals, lead to a unique perspective on that period of history. Coupling his rare view of events with his sense of humor, he has used his gift for writing to produce an accurate account of events which is fun and easy to read. Most soldiers never have the opportunity to find themselves in the sort of situations that Stanton writes about. Using plain language that takes you along with him on the adventure of a lifetime, this book is a must for anyone going on an assignment as a military advisor or observer. A good read for anyone interested in history, the military, or life in the Middle East."
1,Should've Been Advised of His Rights Against...,"Self-incrimination.COL Hart's review below is spot-on.To a civilian reader unfamiliar with military law, good order and discipline, and professional conduct of an Army officer, this book will appear to be exactly as other reviewers have described it...a well-told, entertaining adventure story. However, the truth of the tale appears to be that the author acted with willful disregard to Army regulations and in a reckless manner, which ultimately led to his detection and capture, thus negating whatever tactical usefulness his presence served during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait."
1,Former eye witness to the Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait,"I found Stanton's book as a self-serving promotion of an Army officer who did something stupid and in violation of the current US CENTRAL COMMAND policy and in violation of State Department travel warnings issued weeks before the invasion. Granted as an Army officer also present during the invasion there is no doubt that his two days of observation were interesting but hardly of any strategic value. Two days in the Sheraton and then a human sheild is all very good, and makes a good story for an officer who knowingly entered a country purely for self gain. The books reflects how a individual who has used a circumstance to self promote himself. As any military value is highly questionalbe and not worth the read.COL FRED HARTFORMER HOSTAGE AT THE AMERICAN EMBASSIES IN KUWAIT AND BAGHDAD AUG 1990-DEC 1990."
3,"Good price, but you get what you pay for.","I didn't have any experience when I shopped for this product. Although I like the economical price, I've been disappointed by the quality of some of the included products. This product comes with NO instructions at all. While some of it is intuitive, it would be nice to have directions showing how to put the umbrella together with an external flash. Additional, one of the reflectors broke when I tried to unscrew it (after only 2 uses). I had a very difficult removing it so I could use a different reflection (I battled with pliers for a good 30 minutes). I was very gentle with it. I do like that it comes with a case, although the items really don't fit in the case very well (especially the reflectors). The stands are easy to use, but the lights are quite wobbly at the top and now that I've had one of the reflectors break, I'm apprehensive to tighten anything much."
3,Guns and Anarchy,"This is a business-military SF trilogy with focus on an anarchistic planet. This is no libertarian utopia; this is a very rough world. It is not held up as a model and neither is it scrutinized. There are no special ideas that I noticed, but it is an interesting read.I like having a complete trilogy in my possession (or some autonomy in the novels), and this single binding, though hard to handle, does put the trilogy in my hand.(The first novel is a little harsh on religion, but the others are not so bad.)"
3,PowerBoxing,"Nice game, but you need to be in the line of the infra red to compute. This making a really strenous workout is somewhat difficult to stay in the ""lines"" of the swing."
5,According to college student: Perfect.,"My daughter reports that this mat board is ""perfect"", and asked that I order more for a friend in the dorm. Sounds like a ringing endorsement to me."
4,One of the best,"I own 29 complete Messiahs and this is one of my favorites. The high points of this recording are soprano Heather Harper's slow arias, particularly ""How Beautiful are the Feet"", which is world-best for this aria. ""Redeemer"" is also exceptionally fine. In both, she ornaments heavily and tastefully, and her trills are meltingly musical.Davis' choral and orchestral work is consistent and very good throughout.I can do without the rest of this recording. IMO, best overall recording is Westenberg. If you get Davis (soprano) Westenberg (chorus, tenor, bass, soprano), Mackerras original(bass, alto) Shaw 1966 chorus disk, and the first Marriner (tenor, soprano) and the second Marriner (trumpet) you'll have the best-of-the-best pretty well covered for modern instruments."
1,Handels Massiah CD Review Of Order,Handels Massiah - I choose this rating because the first of two disc were damaged. I don't understand why someone would sell this product that way?The C.D did arrive sooner than expected. The second disc was fine. Overall I would not recommend this CD to someone else due to the poor condition it was in.
4,Not Your Usual Sixties Recording of Messiah,"Sir Colin Davis's first recording of ""Messiah"" is blessed by adecent quartet of solotists a good choir and the LSO. Hisperformance is not one of those ""Victorian"" style ones that youwould hear from Beecham, Boult, or Sargent. It does a good jobon eliminating the ponderous feel that most older Messiahrecordings and performances suffer from. It also avoids the HIPtrap of feeling cold, and sterile. Davis also steers a courseright down the middle between the slowness of some older record-ings and the sometimes excessive tempos of some of the newer ones.And it is much better than his recording with the Bavarian RadioSymphony that he also did for Phillips. It might be interestingto see what kind of performance he would record with the LSOtoday. All in all a satisfactory recording of this work. My onlycomplaint is that there is no libretto included with it. I canalso say that this recording of Messiah beats out many of the""Full"" price ones on the market."
2,subdued and disappointing,"From the opening Sinfonia, this Messiah is far too subdued. While it may be nuanced and even, it lacks passion, grandeur and any sense of the sacred, and has little narrative drive. The Choruses, except for the Hallelujah Chorus, have little majesty. There is also something wrong with the sound mix. I can't quite put my finger on it but somehow the bass-treble balance is just off. I tried the special anniversary 24 bit rerelease and found that the sound of it was, oddly enough, even worse. I would instead very highly recommend Sir Colin Davis' other recording of The Messiah, with the Bavarian Radio Orchestra. It is a bit difficult to find but just spectacular."
4,Would make a good movie,"I liked this book, it's something different, although I did groan a bit at Rachel's gung ho- ness. It's very believable that she would ask to work with someone she saw on t.v. and find him shall we say, less than perfect. The description of New Orleans politics was quite believable as we have a lot of good old boys in my state as well, but I sure hope we aren't that corrupt. I couldn't believe the description of the Cajun living conditions, with children running after cars on their road, I hope that was greatly exagerated. All in all though this was a good read with a likeable main character. I hope to read the next adventure."
4,Good summer read,"OK...so the writing is not top notch, but the action is! I read the entire book in one day on my summer vacation, and a very lazy, pleasant day it was. I found the characters stereotypical, but I couldn't help liking them anyway. The ultimate compliment: I plan to read the other books in the series."
5,Bayou at its best,You can feel the steam rolling off the pages as you are transported to the Louisiana bayou. It twists like an alligator right up to the end.
3,I was torn by this one,"I was tempted to rate this one 4 stars, but when I think of some of the other books I've rated 4 stars, Gator Aide just came up a little short, so I rated it 3, with the disclaimer. Maybe it's 3.5. Anyway, this book was okay overall, and pretty good in spots. Lots of streotyped characters from the South. Kind of makes you wonder how they survive down there. Anyway, this story was able to keep my interest throughout and was not a slow read. In fact, I intend to give Rachel another shot here by ordering another in the Rachel Porter series right now. I did like the strong character Rachel presented. I would recommend this novel for someone looking for light reading. Not much sex. Some good action and a decent plot."
3,This mystery is a pretty good start .,"Personally, I like the book. The bayous came alive, however icky, and I feel that Rachel Porter's character was well developed as a real ""newbie"" all around. She really fell into some holes of her own inexperience that made her believable but her refusal of medical care did not ring true for an intellight person. I would liked to have learned more about Trenton. I think he has a lot more to tell us and is more important than we think. I liked Teri, he is very believable and a good all around ""mom"". I hope we will bee more of Rachel Porter and I'd hate to see her leave New Orleans for a while. Good start."
4,I enjoyed the story,"When I first saw the title, I thought what a dumb title but something in the description must of caught my eye. I really enjoyed the story. It wasn't an edge of my seat, can't put it down book but it did hold my interest. I would read more Rachel Porter mysteries if they come available."
4,Very Good!,"This book was different and very good. In the beginning, I found myself losing interest in it, but also found that I couldn't give up on it. Towards the middle of the book, it picked up and I was hooked. I couldn't put it down! I hope the author will continue the series. I look forward to future books."
3,Light hearted fun from the 1930's,"It seems like the intention here was a sex fantasy but the author followed is humorous instincts rather than erotic instincts. Much of the comedy is silly dialog. He borrows an idea from one of his earlier books ""Nightlife of the Gods"" and has an ancient Greek based statue come to life as a beautiful, naked, amorous, young woman who seeks satisfaction or at least fun. An old couple skinny dips in a pool and physically rejuvenates. People inexplicably spend the whole book naked.No doubt some will take exception to the treatment of the Japanese servant or perhaps for revering cocktails, or operating fire engines under the influence. I allow for the fact that the story is from another time and another mind set. Mostly it's a story that doesn't need to make much sense. It's just light hearted fun."
4,Hard to beat for the price.,"This lens amazed me for the price. I tested it by shooting towards a building about half a mile away. I was surprised that not only could I see the details of the building, I could actually see a lamp in a window ... from half a mile away!It does take a good tripod, patience, & practice to get a clear shot. Chromatic aberration is also a problem, but I don't think you can avoid that unless you spend over $1000+ on a lens."
3,hard to focus,"I've now taken a few pictures with this lens and both a Pentax *ist DS and more recently a K20D. The pictures are highly variable in sharpness. When focussed correctly, the lens seems quite reasonable. But I find it really tricky to focus correctly, since you cover the whole focus range with a surprisingly small twist. This is true even at 800mm, the K20D image stabilization maximum. A tiny, barely perceptible, movement of the focus ring has a huge effect, especially since the depth of field is unavoidably very small. I haven't had much luck with the cameras focus confirmation, which is only spec'ed down to F5.6.I ended up making a partial lens cover, with a hole in the middle, that allows me to effectively stop down the lens by a couple of stops, to get a bit more depth of field, and make the focus a little less sensitive. But I still find that getting a sharp picture is still at best a time-consuming exercise."
4,Likable sequel to the first I-10 comp,"As with the prior ""I-10"" compilation, this disc is an excellent collection of tunes that tell interesting stories and generally capture the spirit of traveling across the USA out on the open road. It has more of a consistently country-rock feel than volume one, especially the Flying Burrito flavored version of ""The Window Up Above"" by Chris Hillman and Herb Pedersen. Still, there are also seasonings of Tex-Mex, Southern gospel, old fashioned rock 'n' roll, and other good stuff. Like the first CD, I was more intrigued by the artists less familiar to me, particularly Garrison Starr. (Sad that her last CD is out of print.) I also like certain clever touches such as the way Steve Forbert's cover of a Dylan song (""Watchin' the River Flow"") is followed by Ms. Starr covering a Forbert song (""It Isn't Gonna Be That Way""). All in all, it's a thoroughly enjoyable collection, and I'll be looking forward to volume three!"
4,I-10 Chronicles 2: One More for the Road,"Looked for this for a while. Glad to have found it for sure. If you liked Vol. 1, you'll definitely like the flavor of this record. Some repeat customers on Vol. 2 and a few new artists like Jim White. Worth the purchase to add it to your collection."
3,WAS A GRIEG A PIANO COMPOSER ONLY?,"This collection is superb for the type of listener who has just been introduced to classical music. If you are, however, an avid classical music fan, in particular - a fan of Grieg - then this is not really the collection for you. The CD's do of course contain the piano concerto, Peer Gynt suites, the Holberg suite. However, it would have been nice to have seen some of Grieg's love songs on the collection. Most of the collection is extremely piano orientated.The piano concerto is given a very fine performance. The soloist in question really gets to grips with the technical brilliance, and the expression of the music itself. Listen in particular to the first movement cadenza. And the ferociously difficult finale.Just to sum up, this collection is a brilliant INTRODUCTION to Grieg. However, if you're already advanced into Grieg's musical output then try something more adventurous. The choice, however, remains yours!"
5,awesome,"If you are looking for a 2.1 system for you PC, look no further. After using cheap speakers for several years, I set out to find the best speakers money could buy. My thoughts...pros:- amazing sound quality, you will hear sounds in your music you didn't know exist.- main volume and sub volume on satellite - perfect- headphone jack on satellite (great for late night gaming)- powerful but clear at high volumescons:- power switch on sub not satellite- satellites us a mini plug instead of bare wire connections (meaning you can't easily use your own speaker wire).- satellites are ""bigger"" than your average cheap speakerThe cons aren't that big of a deal and in no way do they overshadow the amazing sound quality."
1,Bad Buy,"These are the most unreliable speakers I ever bought. They have an annoying hum which never shuts off, I had to send it in for repairs several times.When they do work, they sound decent and will work for most action games. For music, I still prefer Bose speakers. However, I don't trust the reliability of this brand."
1,don't buy at Amazon,"I stupidly had some faith that Amazon had at least reasonable prices. I made a seventy dollar mistake. The Amazon price was $220, the local Best Buy was $150. I love the speakers and now hate Amazon. Maybe seventy bucks is a good price to pay to learn I can't have faith in Amazon for value"
5,No shiny lights or pretty grills. Just serious speakers.,"I first heard these speakers when I was a salesperson for Circuit City in 2001. Through the years I compared a few dozen different brands and models. Some for $20, some for $500. I even hooked up a home theater system to a computer at one time. This is by far the best blend of sound quality, smooth bass and a complete sound range.I can very easily hear a difference in compressed audio and CD/DVD audio; the sound quality is that good. I use these mostly for music and occasionaly for DVDs. They are suitable for any music, hip-hop trance, rocks, jazz...you name it. The bass is never overwhelming and the mid range sounds are perfectly produced.My recommendation is this: try not to fall into marketing and pricing. Go to your local circuit city or best buy and try these out along with the logitechs and others. It will only take a few seconds to fall in love with these speakers."
2,"Great sound, bad quality","I was very happy with these while they worked, doubt you can find better sound for the price.However, just after a year one speaker stopped working and a month later the whole system went caput.I will be paying a little more for a higher quality product this time around."
4,Amazing!!,"Wow, the only speakers you'll need for a desktop. I received these as a gift about 12 YEARS AGO. To this day, they still work flawlessly. Unbelievable quality that's less expensive than Bose. To this day they serve me well as a tv sound system though I can to hook these up to my laptop easily to play music if i feel like it. The subwoofer that comes with it is great. Achieves a deep bass that your neighbors will hate you for if you turn it up. The speakers have really nice mids and hi. If I were to have a complaint about these is that it could have had more outputs on the back of the sub and the controls on the one speaker are limited to volume and bass control. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone."
5,Great product,"I personally did not purchase this product from Amazon, but from a local retailer. Got home and plugged these babies in and WOW!!! Talk about quality! I'm a sucker for a lot of bass and the included subwoofer can offer more than your expectations. Full, crisp and clean sound. This was my first experience with the Klipsch brand and I was overly impressed. These speakers are worth every penny. I feel like I ripped the retailer off for getting them for such a reasonable price. I would have gladly paid more for them. These things are a steal."
2,I'm torn,"Yes, these speakers are as great as they are made out to be in terms of sound. However, two weeks after I bought my first pair, the left speaker went out. After checking all the wiring and messing around with it, I realized that the speaker worked fine, it just wasnt recieving any signals from the sub. So I took them back and replaced them with another pair. The ones I have now have worked great for a year, but now the same thing is happening again. No signal coming from the sub to the left speaker. I am just getting tired of having to replace these, because they are really wonderful sounding speakers. I don't want to get a different pair, but I will because I don't feel like going through this everytime I get a set of these."
1,Poor Reliability,"I've owned my Klipsh Promedia 2.1 speakers for just under two years. The performance has been very good, up until today. The system just stopped working and the green power light did not come on. I found the main fuse blown and replaced it with a new fuse, which also immediately blew. I then disassemble the sub unit and performed trouble shooting. I discovered that the main transformer has an internal short. This is not something I can repair, other than to try and find a replacement transformer, which will be nearly impossible. I've used Klipsh speakers for years in my home theater system and they've been great. However, to have these Promedia's fail so quickly, and after they are out of warranty, is extremely disappointing. I've been willing to pay the extra premium for Klipsch products due to their great reputation and sound quality. However, after reading about all the failures of this model, and now experiencing one myself, my confidence in this company is gone."
5,Best of the Best,"I have had my Promedia 5.1 speakers since the first day they came out and beleive me they had a waiting list for hundreds of customers. Why such a big fuzz over a computer speaker set you ask? Well the answer is simple, these are not your ordinary computer speakers. Forget about Polk, Creative, Boston, and Altec Lansing, the keyword here is Klipsch. Those other speakers don't even come close to the shear power and fidelity these speakers produce. And if it is bass that you want, Klipsch hands down manufactures the World best Bass. I hooked up my speakers to an Audigy Ex card, that allowed me to hook up my PS2/Xbox and DVD to my system. There are few games with 5.1 capabilities but it does come in handy when you watch DVD's. The sound is simply amazing, and if you dont beleive me just read the other reviews on this page. Still not impressed well just hearing these speakers out once will do the trick."
2,Unreliable,"Sounds great, when it works. I've replaced the sub-woofer or various parts the customer service has sent me for the sub-woofer four times in less than a year. Once it blew out several circuits in my house. As many of the reviews indicate, the lack of a power shutoff switch and other internal problems make these very unreliable."
2,Two bad on plugs,"Just others have commented. First unit I bought the plug on the subwoofer broke. Second set of speakers, while cleaning, same plug broke. Great sound, lousy quality. Don't bother with these speakers or be very careful"
2,Minimal Use- lasted only 3 years,"With minimal use- I am talking about 50 hours of use during a 3 year time period, the subwoofer malfunctioned. I did expect to get more quality and use out of these speakers."
2,Stopped working after less than 24 hours.,"I picked these up while they were on sale at a retail store. I was really impressed with the sound quality and was looking forward to using it to play some games. Unfortunately, when I got home from work the next day, the speakers were stuck on full volume and were playing white noise. They still played audio from a source, but the static was always audible and I could not change the volume. I had to return them. This was my first experience with Klipsch, and I had high expectations given their reputation, but I was very disappointed. I'll probably give them another chance in the future, but not without considering competing products first."
5,Pleased with this Purchase,"The sound quality of this set of speakers is amazing. I've heard instruments and vocals clearly defined, unlike what I've heard before. The bass is not the booming 'throw-you-against-the-wall' type, but it's mellow with a smooth kick. Hearing these speakers has made me interested in a Klipsch set for my home sound system. I highly recommend these speakers."
2,Great sounding but didn't last long...,"I bought the Klipsch 2.1 speakers about 2 years ago to replace my old Yamaha (YST-MSW10); they sounding great until about a week ago! It looks as though I'll have to pull the Yamahas back out of storage. The sub-woofer in the Klipschs comes in and out every 5 minutes or so (must be a short some where?). I've checked all external connections and they are fine. When the sub-woofer goes in and out of producing a sound it gives off a 'scratchy' sound that sounds awful. I too use surge protectors and never turn the volume up past half-way, so the problem shouldn't be from misuse."
5,6 Years and still KICKIN'!,"I have owned this sound system for over 6 years - and it is still available for purchase if that doesn't say enough. The bass and sound is unbelievable, you don't need anything else but these 3 speakers to get you moving!"
5,better than bose by far...,"I owned the bose companion 3 speakers for a while and ended up selling them because they just didn't do it for me. Months later I picked up these bad boys and I am impressed! They cost less and sound amazing! I do wish there were an easier to get to power button, but that's not a deal breaker. I think I will be sticking with these for a long time!"
4,"Great sound,But","The klipsch 2.1 Have magnificent sound quality after tampering with it a bit,Its obviously made more with music in mind tho,To hear voices over based clealy had to do alot of tampering unless i was playing music,Movies will sound great with propper positioning and volume to sub tampering,And lastly regardless of the work you have to put in for certain media to get voices to pop thru the bass this system is one of the best for pc hands down,But have a cheap backup in case."
1,"Great sound, won't stick around","Unlike some other reviewers, my DIN plug is fine. But after 2 years everything else is cooked. First, the wire clips running off the subwoofer broke. Then the subwoofer blew out completely. I replaced the sub, but now one of the satellites has loud static. Don't know if I should even bother replacing it.UPDATE:I spoke too soon-- later in the same day as I wrote the original review, the DIN broke. Don't tempt the fates! ...and don't buy Klipsch Krap."
5,OMG BUTT KICKING AWESOME THE BEST,I NEVER HEARD COMPUTER SPEAKERS LIKE THIS BEFORE EVER AWESOME!!!!!!!! HELLS BELLS ROCKS IF YOUR A ROCKER THESE PUPS ARE FOR YOU ITS BETTER TO BURN OUT THEN FADE AWAY HAHAHAHA THESE ARE GREAT
2,Bittersweet,"Pros : Great sound system, worth the 120$ every single cent, Can easily shake up any mid-sized room with music.great for partie, small get-together's etc.Fast shipping easy transaction!Cons: Item was listed USED LIKE NEW! however subwoofer blew out in a week after i bought it and i didn't even blast anything on max, the previous owner has clearly put this sound system through its prime and the condition is not LIKE NEW because a system alike new would not fall after a week."
1,Defective on arrival,"This arrived with a broken speaker wire clip. I have emailed Klipsch for a return. Too late to call them today. I will call them tomorrow morning. Really upset that I have to wait now to return this, then wait for them to process the return, before they can send me a replacement. This minor issue could have been avoided with some adequate quality control."
3,"Good sound, lack luster quality","I purchased these speakers a two years ago for my home pc. They have amazing sound and when I wanted to listen to the speakers on the other side of the house I could turn them up and they did a great job. The downfall to the speakers is how long they last. They failed almost to the day 2 years after I purchased them. My last set of Altec Lansing speakers lasted 12 years...i expect much more from a high dollar set of speakers. As a side note I have the speakers running thru my surge protector, which hasn't blown so there wasn't a surge, just poor build quality."
5,Some of the best speakers around,I came upon the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 speakers at Best Buy a few months ago at Best Buy. It was an open box that I purchased for $99. I now wish I could find another deal like that. I love the speakers and will probably buy another set for my computers at home. They are great!
4,Best Computer Speakers on the Market!,"I first saw these at Best Buy store on demo. I thought they sounded amazing! Well went onto Amazon to locate a set for a low price and I did. Although these were used, it's as if they weren't even removed from the box! The bass is loud and boomy. The high ends are crisp and clear. I'd prefer these over my Bose speakers any day! And they were cheaper!"
4,Good Buy for the Money,Excellent speakers. I am experiencing some occassional popping but I'm not sure if that's from my lap top where the music is stored or from the speakers.
4,it r0xx,ive heard it a couple of times and the sound is just perfect. the only thing about it that it needs something that supports the rearspeakers. another thing is that [is bad]that its only shipped to U.S... :/
2,Broke after 2 years. Bad customer service,"I bought this because I am a musician and an audiophile. I wanted the best and was willing to pay 150 dollars at BB.because of the high end price I figured it would be bullet proof and blow my mind like Bose. Unfortunately, It was very mediocre and the Mid's sucked. it was not made for Rock music.Conveniently after 2 years, the speaker shorted out. I payed 30 dollars from the main website to replace the speaker wire. Then after it came, I found out that the amp was Blown and the repair man said it would be 200-250 dollars to fix. What a waste man. I ended up having BB just recycle it."
2,Sounds good when works,These speakers sound great but they break down too easily. I do not have much luck with these. Buyers be aware to keep the receipt for exhange or work with stores that allow exchange.These speakers sound comparable with Altec Lansing 621 and slightly better than Monsoon 1000.
1,right speaker blow up on the first day of use,"Never going to buy Klipsch again in my life. I was exited opening my new speaker system. I enjoy music. 3 hours later... I have a malfunctioning speaker.Stay with logitech, they are the best."
4,Impressive,"Picked up this little system based on the reviews and the price. I was kind of skeptical, I looked at the comparable bose system, but didn't want to shell out the extra 100 bones. This little 2.1 is an excellent value for what it is. The 3"" woofs have more throat (mid range) than I figured they would, which is a good thing. It did take some fussing with the an EQ to make the system shine. If you want more, go to a receiver and floor speakers (my initial intentions, but I'm saving it for later). Overall good sound so far (first few hours), we'll see how it holds up. I'd recommend it for anybody looking for a good 2.1, just make sure you have a decent sound card."
3,great for awhile,Its sucks these things crap out so quick they are an awesome sounding system even at low volumes. Mine finally stopped with the sub first then one speaker. Had alit of cracking and popping when adjusting the volume very un precise. But when it worked it out preformed my full size audio system. I wish they would fix the flaws they are killer when they work
1,Does not last,"These were by far the best computer speakers I have ever owned.However last night the left channel started to crackle, buzz, and pop. Then it died. A strong burning smell coming from the left speaker filled the room.I did a quick Google search, and I am not the only person to have this problem. Repair costs start at $75 plus shipping both ways, and local repair shops say it's not worth the fix. Unfortunately they are going in the trash tonight.While these speakers produced amazing sound quality, I cannot recommend purchasing them unless you plan on purchasing another set on a regular basis."
1,Yikes,"Dead out of the box. I had fairly cruddy sound from these speakers in the R and L channels -- just nothing out of the sub, so the sound was terribly weak as you'd expect.For the price, I expected something that sounded better than my Insignias. I'm still looking."
5,Awesome,Unbelievable sound for a very decent price! Can't believe I didn't upgrade sooner!! Who would have thought you could get thumping bass from a pair of computer speakers??
1,Great sound - while it lasts,I've owned two pairs of these speakers over the last 6 years. Both pairs eventually lost enough fidelty to become practically worthless. This happens when the main connection from the subwoofer becomes so loose that sound has a lot of static or is entirely absent on one side. Klipsch knows of this issue - just search their online forums - but will only fix it if the product is still under their warranty.
2,"Great sound, but the subwoofers apparently highly prone to failure","I had been using this speaker set for a bit over a year and had been very satisfied with the sound quality. One of the best, IMO (although my new HK Soundsticks have since won me over). However, a couple months ago the subwoofer failed on me, for reasons I don't yet know. I was considering having it repaired or just buying a new Klipsch set, but a little Googling turned up some forum discussions that indicate the subwoofer with this system is highly prone to failure. Needless to say, this was very disappointing. For that reason alone, I'm posting this review with a huge ding to the rating over this issue. It's a shame, because otherwise they are a great choice."
3,Awesome ...BUT they sure didnt last long,"Loved these speakers...talk about one wall blasting system...crisp sound, great bass, clean highs and midrange. Bought them a little over a year ago and now the right speaker is now buzzing. Not good and Im very disappointed. I would have thought these would have been more durable. Too bad. Upgrading to another THX set but a 5.1 system...and not Klipsch.Amazing sound if only they would last."
3,disappointing midrange performance,"Bought the Klipsch 2.1 speaker system in a retail store, not on Amazon. Previously owned computer sound systems include a 2.1 Monsoon system and a powered Sony 2.0 speaker system (wood cabinet); the Sony is the better sounding of the two.The reviews on Amazon provided useful suggestions and information on these speakers. A few reviews contained suggestions about modifying aspects of the sound quality such as plugging the bass port to subdue the very prominent low-end. There are also many reviews stating that these speakers lack mid-range; this is very true.My system had the same problem another reviewer had with the right satellite speaker cutting out. After messing around with the configuration, I discovered that the satellite speaker with the controls on it seems to work fine when connected as the left speaker (but has a cutout problem when connected as the right speaker). Being right handed, I originally configured it as the right speaker."
1,Satellite DOA,"Sounds like this system might have been alright, but it's hard to tell a good stereo when you only hear out of one of the channels. The other satellite speaker is completely dead, right out of the box."
2,This system is good for games only...,"First of all my name is Joe and I am 6' feet tall. I am used to real sound like hardcore music at all times. This system had me dissapointed because when I was playing the song ""Elvisd is Dead"" from The By2Bikers the speakers blew off out of the casing almost hitting my cat who was right beside the speakers enjoying the beats... Anyway its good overall, but I should suggest don't drink while listening to music so loud cause it is not good for the tympanic membrane of the aureola maximus."
5,"Quality speakers, will blow you!","For the price offered here at amazon I find the Kilpsch Promedia 2.1 a good value. They have held up to everything I've thrown at them, whether it be music, games or movies, all without distortion. I wish that the power cable was modular just in case it ever needs replacing, but alas it is attached, my only other complaint is that the power switch is located on the back of the sub-swoofer which normally sits on the floor, not very convenient to get to. Other than those minor complaints, overall its a quality built product. My only regret is that i didn't purchase it earlier."
5,Great set of speakers.,"I've had these for about 6 years now, and I couldn't be happier. I've never gone through the issues other seem too. I don't know if it has changed in the past years, but I absolutely love these. Just great quality all around. Clear sound, nice bass. I watch movies, play Xbox and listen to music on these, and they perform great."
2,"Good, while they work...","These are good speakers, while they last. These speakers will give you good sound for a couple of years. Once the electronics burn out in the subwoofer, you're screwed. I am a very casual user and don't have many hours on these speakers and I am now faced with trying to find somewhere close where I can recycle them... either that or pay close to $80 plus shipping each way to have Klipsch fix them. There have got to be better speakers out there and it's worth the time to try to find them!!"
5,Klipsch Promedia 5.1 THX System,"I won't waste time with rhetoric, but this system combined with Turtle Beach's Santa Cruz sound card is the BOM.......B!!!! For Real!!! I would go so far as to say you wouldn't crave for anything better, frankly I don't think there is. If you decide to purchase it for a computer, be sure to obtain a six speaker sound card. The control tower allows you to tailor the rear, center and sub, combined with the application software with the Santa Cruz ... more than enough. As for price ... well worth it. You won't be disappointed."
5,Say goodbye to the traditional stereo ....,I'm not an audiophile but I can say hands down these are some of the best speakers I have heard. Deep rich sound ... enough volume to deafen you when in front of the PC.When I first got them hooked up and played a piece of music I thought there was a problem with the sub-woofer ... I kept hearing this noisy vibration ... it took me more than several seconds to realize that some of the pictures I have hanging on the wall were vibrating from all the bass! (:With digital music formats and media players and speakers like these ... I don't think I need my stereo any more ....I love these speakers!
1,don't buy for recording,"I purchased these speakers to replace some altec lansing speakers which would no longer work with a new computer. I read reviews and decided on these. I should have listened more to CNET, they are muddy and have way too much bottem. They are not good at all for recording. I would not recomend these, I paid 130 for them, and I don't think they sound as good as a 30 dollar speaker set. They are loud and have a muddy bass response so if that is what you are looking for buy these."
5,Finest Computer Speakers in the Land!!,"I have a high end home theater with Klipsch Reference speakers and B&K; 7.1 Amplifier. The sound of these ProMedia 2.1 speakers is just as amazing to me for the computer as that system is for the Home Theater. I can't find words to tell you how strongly I recommend these speakers. I also have a Sound Blaster X-Fi Xtreme Music sound card in my computer, so the speakers get the best signal to reproduce.If life was as good as these speakers, we would be in heaven!! They are that good!"
5,"Klipsch are ""great""","I've been enjoying Klipsch loudspeakers for years. I have anoutstanding Home Theater using the Klipsch ""Reference"" series,more specifically, the ""RF-83 Floorstanding"", they ROCK. Now,I""ve purchased the ""Klipsch ProMedia 2.1"" for one of my desk-top computers and they ROCK too...! You just can't go wrongwith their excellent products no matter which models you buy."
3,Good Speakers but cables and connections are very poor,"I had these speakers for a few years and generally they were pretty good speakers, although a bit more expensive. Unfortunately, I just barely moved my sub woofer and the cord's DIN connector broke off making them essentially worthless. I guess there is a replacement part, but I ended up scrapping my set for something else."
5,Paradigm Shift!,"Last week I set up my new brand new screamin' fast Dell XPS and plugged in the cheap Dell twin USB desktop speakers. Fine. A marginal improvement over the Altec Lansing speakers I have been using for 12 years.Not being as blown away with the sonics as I had been with the video and processing speed and feeling like splurging, I ordered this Klipsch system from Amazon.I just plugged everything in and was wondering if this would be a big or little sound upgrade as I have not upgraded the sound card yet. Oh BOY. I opened iTunes and randonly clicked on Hells Bells. The bell sound literally leaped out at me at 1/3 volume.....and then the kick drum started and my legs began vibrating.Same with the Bass in Miss You. Unreal. I had no idea. I am VERY happy with this purchase."
2,Junk,"These sound great when they work, but unfortunately the stereo plug has always been an annoying pain an rarely gives me stereo sound. I typically have to choose between one channel or the other. I've tested the jack, and the plug is clearly the problem."
1,Left channel failed after 1 year and 8 months,"Klipsch ""customer service"" didn't offer any assistance as the system was 8 months out of warranty. Would not purchase again based on this experience."
5,Amazing at the price...,"I needed a speaker set up in my workshop for testing audio circuits that i like to build and was looking at studio monitors, then i found a website with audio test frequencies, i played the various tones through these speakers which i had already hooked up to my computer having bought them a year ago, then i realised if these sound good why not use them, so i went out and bought a second pair just to use in the workshop, now when i'm not using them for testing, i can plug them into my smartphone, mp3 player etc and listen to music.I was concerned about the frequency response, but the test tones sound great, the 40Hz one is REALLY sweet, fantastic low down bass response.A great sounding set up which you can use for computers, ipods, mp3 players etc, you would be hard to beat these unless you spend substantially more cash!!"
5,Klipsch Promedia 4.1 kicks A**,... I was blown away by the clarity and sheer volume. I have never heard a higher quality computer speaker. The only way to get better sound on a computer would be to use a full blown home theater system. They are almost perfect in every way. The only things I don't like are; lack of included stands for rear speakers; mini stereo plugs for the speakers and no power button. Otherwise they are perfect. The only problem is the lack of quality from the sound blaster extigy I am using them with. Buy the speakers only get extigy if you have to (broken laptop sound chip.)
5,Two years old and going strong!,"I just purchased this system used. It is two years old and, I'm very happy to say, it is still fabulous. Small, yet powerful. I live in a tiny apartment and don't want thunderous bass because of my neighbors. This ProMedia system is good because you can adjust the bass waaayyyy down, and the system still sounds great. (But, if you want some bass, watch out! It WILL give it to you.)Some people say there isn't enough high end, or enough middle... I've been playing around with the Windows Media Player equalizer and can adjust the speakers however I want for whatever music I happen to be listening to. I recommend you try it if the ProMedia isn't providing you with the sound qualities you prefer. The problem may be the computer's default settings. (The WMP equalizer is hard to find but just do a 'help' and you will locate it.)"
4,Decent+,Not too bad for the money. They sound great - for the money. Two downsides worth mentioning: the speakers POP when you switch the speakers on and the on/off switch is inconveniently located on the back of the subwoofer box.
5,The end of your search for Computer Speakers,"There are hundreds of reviews, so I will simply say this system is to die for. Put in about 6 hrs of searching and testing. THe Lucas THX is awesome for gaming. The sound is so rich and the BASS is amazing. One key feature to look at when buying is the adjustable BASS. Most have just a standard volume with no Bass level. It's about double what you would pay for another comparable system, but it's just too darn perfect to pass up."
5,Excellent,"I'm very happy with these speakers. They are powerful and very clear. The sound is great when I play games, watch movies, and especially when I play my music loud."
5,I Love this sound system,"These speakers have preformed amazingly well for over two years now. These speakers are powerful, clear, and provide an excellent range of sounds. During movies, I often mute the movie, because I think someone is knocking on my door or there is an emergency response vehicle driving by... The speakers project the sound that well!These have never made me upset at audio quality; I have always been able to focus on the movie/game/music without any problems. The bass is impressively powerful, and able to go higher than I can comfortably listen to it (without any sound distortion).Excellently priced high quality speakers. I can not write enough good things about these. You will not regret buying this (if you are looking for a 2.1 system)."
1,Worked fine until proprietary cable came apart,Speakers sounded great and I had no problems with them until a proprietary cable that plugs into the subwoofer from the speakers came apart at the terminal. Very poor workmanship. System does not work at all without the cable and is now completely worthless.
5,awesome pair of speakers,"pros: crystal clear, performs very well in lowrange, midrange and also high frequencies.cons: you have to turn down the bass to a great extent for normal listening because it thumps even at the lowest bass."
4,Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 Speaker System works for me,"I was looking for a speaker system for my Sansa e280 MP3 player. There is not out there to support Sansas. After reading various reviews, I first went with the JBL On Tour speakers. I was very disappointed with the sound quality (especially base) so I returned them. I next tried to order Cambridge Soundworks Multi-Media Extreme 2.1. After ordering, I was notified that the satellite speakers were backordered for 6+ weeks. I cancelled that order and went with these Klipsch speakers instead. I have been very pleased with the speakers overall (great sound quality for the price). I only use them for my Sansa and not my computer. My only complaint (mentioned by other reviewers as well) is that the on-off switch is on the back of the base - not very convenient."
5,Great sound!,My husband and I are very happy with the price and quality of these speakers. Good base and balance.
2,ONE EYED PIRATE AT LOW VOLUME,"This product sounds simply amazing loud, sounds like LIVE, everything comes alive when turned up ....BUT...one channel is dead when the volume is at low level listening and who wants to rock out at 6 in the morning or 11 at night. I can buy a passive per amp to fine tune the volume but I would have to spend $300+ extra then I will be better off migrating to the Logitech Z623. This speaker system is good for the birds the way it performs right now. Now I know why testfreaks.com gave it a 6.8 rating and the Logitech z623 a 10.Klipsch should display more corporate responsibility by fixing this issue or just take this product off the market if it chooses the other route."
3,Bass is NOT good,"I've had my Logitech 2.1's for a couple of years now, and decided to try out these since everyone raves about them so much. People weren't exaggerating about the crisp and clear mids and highs. That part sounds excellent, but my god the subwoofer is simply terrible. I really can't believe that this is what passes for a sub with this company. My 2 year old Logitech is much more pleasing to me, and I was hoping for better not worse. I think I'll just have to assemble a good system from component home audio to get the sound I'm looking for. This is just sad. Don't buy if you enjoy a good subwoofer!"
3,They are decent... but just adequate,"I've had these for several years and also a pair of Ribbon Planar speaker. The now defunct Monsoon MM1000. I will take a ribbon planar speaker any day over conventional paper cone speakers. While the Klipsch 2.1 have an average quality, in other words they have a broad stereo image. They just are a bit slow. On the other hand the Monsoon MM1000 being a flat ribbon planar speaker have an extremely fast response and a pinpoint stereo image. Move off that center and the stereo image falls flat. Unlike the Klipsh 2.1 the image remains but just isn't as sweet a s the MM1000. You could do worse than the Klipsch but you can also do better."
2,"Great sound, poor reliability.","Unfortunately, all of the review that quote this system as having great sound, but lacking reliability have proven quite true. Having spoken with a friend, I found he has run across reliability issues with these in the past as well. It seems Logitech might be king of the hill now. I will see if my Klpisch speakers are salvageable, but I'm not holding out too much hope."
2,"Defect, right out of the box......","Just purchased these as a birthday gift. Unpacked them and the set looks great. Went to connect the left speaker wire to the left red speaker clips on the subwoofer; the red tab slips out, and the spring goes inside the subwoofer! Nice!! These are going back to Best Buy!!"
2,My Sub blew after 4 weeks,"i purchased klipsch speakers because my friend recommended them. little did i know my sub would blow out after 4 weeks. i rarely play music over 50% if you want real loud music, get a higher powered system."
5,Don't look anywhere else,"The sound quality is amazing. The price is relatively lower than other models and it is not worth spending so much money on anything else than this. Before i bought this thing, i did not know that it was so powerfull. I have a bose 3.2.1 system as well. These speakers are as good and powerfull as those and the funny thing is they are 600 dollars cheaper then the bose. I should have bought these speakers from the beggining."
5,They are Klipsch!,"I Have 3 pairs of Klipsch flooring standing speakers, KSF 8.5,KG4's and Forte 2's, and these little speakers are really something, so is the sub.They have the Klipsch sound.I could recommend these speakers to anyone. I have them on my computer in the living room and my wife and I listen to themevery morning, while we have our coffee.I'm retired and searched everywhere for satisfyingspeakers, before I bought.For the application there are no better speakers on the market,and at a good price too.Amazon did just what they said they would do and I recieved myspeakers in just a few days.I would Highly recommend Amazon and the Klipsch 2.1's for yournext order."
3,What kind of a noise annoys a noise-ter?,"The sound from these speakers is terrific; however, I encountered constant background noise from both the base unit and the small speakers -crackling, humming, repeating thumps from the normal use of the computer. Company techies could not solve; Amazon replaced the units and I had same experience with second set."
2,"Brilliant sound, weak connectors, poor reliability","I have had two sets of these marvelous sounding speakers and both have failed. They feature outstanding lows, mids, and highs for about the best 2.1-channel PC sound I've heard.Unfortunately, they do not hold up. My first set developed a buzz after several weeks. I exchanged them for another set because I loved the sound so much. After about 3 years, my second set has failed. The left or right speaker would continually cut in and out, forcing me to fiddle with the wires and the connector to the subwoofer. Finally, today, I was happily listening to iTunes when all of a sudden the speakers began to buzz and pop until the sound cut out and the little green power light faded out, never to relight again. Very, very disappointing!"
4,Almost Perfect,"The speaker system is great... The black and red plugs in the back make it easy to add additional speakers to the system... Howeverrrr there tend to be many wires making them not very easily movable, and when using the sub, its cant be turned up too high especially in songs with big bass for it will sound awkward. My brother purchased the Logitech version a week before me and his were very similar, but with better bass."
5,These guys are inkredible,"All aspects of these speakers are top notch; sound great, woofer a little large but satellites good size for desktop. Really enjoyed the music these guys came prerecorded with. Would have preferred a little more Country but pleasently surprised by the amount of Jazz. You can't go wrong with these speakers."
4,"Sound great, cheap build quality - read on.","These sound great but I question the build quality which feels very cheap. The satellite speakers are very light and are made out of plastic.You might say, ""But these are THX certified"". Well, THX only measures sound quality and not build quality.That said, these do sound great and the subwoofer is just the right size yet still totally cranks out the bass, whereas the comparable Logitech model has a subwoofer that is way too huge.I wonder how long my Klipsch ProMedias will last, I have high hopes (and low expectations) but for the fairly cheap price, I was willing to take the risk."
2,Powerful Speakers with Poor Sound Quality,"Overall, the Klipsch speakers have great potential but seem to be poorly made. These speakers definitely have power but do not reproduce sound well. The bass sounds very distorted and artificial. The highs also seem to be over amplified and there is very little mid range. These speakers work well if you want something loud and don't really care about sound quality."
5,Best speaker ever have,"Sound quality is the best of all speakers on its range!. I was did some research before make the decision, comparing brands and models from Bose, Logitech, etc. I like jazz so I wanted speakers with a good bass. At the end most people wants the best quality of sound. Price was not important for my decision. I spend some time testing most of the options available on the market, but the best quality-value was the Klipsh Promedia THX system. So I bought them on Amazon. I have like a month with my system and really happy with it. The power of the speakers is so huge that most of the time I have to use it on just a 20% of its capacity!!. The only inconvenient I see is to have volume and sub woofer controls on one of the speakers, however I'm using them with a Bluetooth receiver so it is not really affecting me at all. After this I will consider Klipsh as one of the best options for my next set of home theater speakers."
4,Great Sound! LOTS of punch!,"Highs and mid range are unbelievably clear! Plenty of bass punch, too. My only complaint is that the controls are on the satellite speakers instead of a wired remote. That prevents me from moving the satellite speakers areound to other locations, but it is a small price to pay for the incredible cound quality this system produces. If you want to listen to music on your computer as I often do, you can't go wrong with this item. Sound quality rivals many home systems."
5,I love the product and the service from amazon,The speakers sound great. The ease of use and all the connections are great. The service I got from Amazon was great also...I will order again.
3,I think Logitechs are better,"I own both these and a set of Logitech Z-2300s, and I strongly prefer the Zs. The sound to my ears, is just more full with much clearer, crisper bass response on the Logitech speakers. They also have better dynamic range than the Klipschs.The first set of Klipschs I bought were defective (thank you Amazon for making the exchange so simple!!). I don't find the build quality quite up to that of the Logitechs.The one advantage that the Klipsch speakers have for me is that they have an auxiliary input into which one can plug an ipod or other audio device. This is why I bought them, and that is a great feature that works beautifully. I don't understand why Logitech didn't put such a simple feature on their top-of-the-line speakers.So, I would say, if you need the option of using these speakers with an mp3 player, go with Klipsch. If not, go with Logitech."
3,Great Sound BUT.......,"These sound incredible. I have had my set for 2 years. Today the amp died. A check of many online forums indicates this is nothing new. In fact, many people experience the same problem at right around the 2-year mark. So, if you want to spend close to $400 for speakers that sound wonderful for about 2 years, you can't beat Klipsch. I however will be giving some Logitech Z-5500s a try..."
1,Poor Reliability - AFTER WARRANTY EXPIRES,"These speakers sounded great until shortly after the warranty expired. The the left channel stopped working. I emailed Klipsch customer service and they told me that after the warranty expired they really can't help me. Then I checked various websites with reviews of the PM 2.1's and I found hundreds of reviews complaining of similar problems. The speakers sounded really good, but my next set will be another brand."
2,Very disappointed,"I purchased this 240w Klipsch Promedia 2.1 speaker set to hook up to my pc and mp3 player. First both the speakers and the subwoofer are marked made in China. Now onto the sound - far less volume than I was hoping for - in my opinion not very efficient speakers. At higher volumes there is marked distortion. In summary I think this is a low quality speaker set, minimally adequate for a pc - but a far cry from audiophile quality. I will be reluctant to purchase other Klipsch audio products if this unit is at all representative of what their speaker quality is about."
4,Great speakers but bad design.,I would have given it 5 stars if the on/off switch is reachable. They should have the on/off switch on the satellite speakers and not behind the subwoofer.
1,"Poor design, mine crapped out","The sound is great at first, but there's a design flaw in this product that made mine useless. The right satellite speaker has the subwoofer and volume dials on it. But it's really cheap construction, and after a while the rubber dials start to vibrate and make a ""chirping"" sound during play. This occurs even when played at a reasonable volume. I babied these speakers and still had this problem. If you're thinking about buying these, ask yourself one question. Do you feel lucky?"
1,poorly built,Garbage!....they sound great but the input cable in back of the subwoofer is fragile. The weight of the cable itself eventually makes it malfunction and you end up moving it around trying to get it to jive so you get your sound back until it finally quits completely! This happened to others I know.DON'T WASTE YOUR CASH ON KLIPSCH!!!!
4,LUV IT,"The amount of sound coming out of this thing is impressive and worth every penny. It blows out any other 2.1 sound system within its price range (well the exception being the harmon kardon sound sticks II, which has slightly clearer sound but less bass). My music sounds clear and crisp, with all the booming depth and beautiful mids and highs present. Im no audiophile, but i was satisfied with this piece of audio equipment.The only thing that i don't like are the wires that come with it. They are too thin and can break easily, so just buy some of those monster of cables and your set. Plus there have been many cases of these speakers breaking down, and my speakers have crapped out on me once and while, but i just adjust the wires a bit. Best thing to do is to just find a place for it, and don't touch it too much."
1,Enjoy wonderful sound while you have it!,"It's so sad. These speakers sounded so great when I bought them, and considering the price, well they should have too. I connected them to my computer and was very happy with them. Then, as you can read from *many* others (try the forum on the Klipsch site), they fell apart, in just over a year. The contact between subwoofer and rest of system failed, both sides of it, and I suspect other things too, and troubleshooting and repair means pulling the whole thing to bits with a soldering iron. That's where it is now - broken and in bits. As for so many others, the dealer in my case was completely uninterested and unhelpful. Be warned - a very unreliable product."
5,Just overall amazing,"I must say that the Klipsch ProMedia system has amazing sound quality in anything you do wether it be listening to music, gaming or simply watching movies. I had a smaller sub before (forgot the name and brand) but once I plugged in my Klipsch ProMedia, I was practically blown away when I listened to my music and played games, The sound quality was much higher and the bass is just amazing. If you want a good wall shaking system with high quality I think the Klipsch ProMedia system is for you."
3,The Best Sound But....,"These speakers are clearly the best sounding computer speakers I have ever heard. Hands down winner but the DIN plug from the small speaker to the sub has a tendency to break. The sub, made to sit under your desk tends to get kicked. The DIN plug is not strong enough and breaks off the pins. This has happened to me twice, the first time I waited 4 months for a replacement control pod/DIN to become available. The second time it not only broke the DIN pins but destroyed the plug in the sub. do yourself a favor and watch your feet and purchase a extra control pod just in case as I think these speakers are being discontinued and parts may be scarce in the future. Great sounding system, poorly designed control cable.EDIT 02/2012: After the second replacement DIN/Control I have had no more issues. Still love the sound!"
4,Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX Certified Computer 3-Speaker System,"So far, so good. I've had these speakers for about a month and am satisfied. Was hoping to upgrade to the monster cable but have not done so yet as it was out of stock on the Klipsch website. Both highs and lows sound adequate to my ears. No complaints whatsoever as yet. I do sense a slight lack of midrange but found it easily adjusted by simply adjusting the equalizer on my pc to emphasize the midrange a bit more. No big deal at all there. All 'n' all I'm a satisfied customer."
1,"Good Sound, Terrible Quality","I loved the sound of my ProMedia 2.1 enough that I bought a second set for another location to play iTunes. Well, now the left channel has gone out on both sets. The speakers themselves all work so I bought a replacement preamp control cord unit but that didn't solve the problem. Still no sound out of the left speakers.Klipsch Support said I probably need to replace the amps - 80+ dollars each - but that it was an unusual problem . I said there were loads of complaints online about the left speaker going dead and he responded that there were no such problems. He said these online complainers are loopy (his words exactly). I guess the Klipsch strategy is repeat how great you are and deny any problems.Call me loopy but they certainly will never get my money again."
1,Made in CHINA not Germany,Great sound with warm big bass tones unfortunately you wont get to hear it often because the speakers are poor build quality. NOt made in germany like their higher end speakers instead theyre made in china. Ive had to replace the control pod twice! and just when I thought all was going ok the subwoofer just died on me. Its a shame because they do sound nice.
2,"Great sound, but not long lasting","First let me start by saying, I LOVE these speakers. They sound better than more expensive speakers from several manufactures in the $200 range, including bose.However, they have a ~2-3 year lifespan. Mine failed after 4 years (with hardly any use), and after looking around the internet, these speakers are notorious for their short lifespan, and most people have a failure by year 3. The amps just blow out. The new ones have a new cheaper amp design, I would not feel confident purchasing them."
5,5 years and going strong,"Like some of the other reviews have said the volume knob is somewhat touchy, and the system has the potential to be VERY loud. I have never gone above 1/3 of max volume. Other than that I love them. The sound quality is great, and there is an extra 3.5 audio-in jack on the main satelite speaker. So you can play 2 different audio sources an once, with no loss of audio quality that I have noticed."
3,Great Sound but Lasted 1 yr,Kind of pricy to only work for 14 months. The secondary board fried for some reason. I might have given them a reasonable doubt if it was the power board but this could not have been caused by a surge. I am looking for a replacement set that will sound as good as these but from another manufacturer.
4,"Great Sound Quality, Questionable Build Quality","I had two sets of these, and they both failed - one at 3 years and one at 3.5 years. The sound quality is terrific, and the sub is actually pretty powerful, but the build quality leaves a bit to be desired."
2,Really bad,"I don't know where this cookbook came from but I found it in my shelves the other day, it is full of many obvious vegetarian pasta recipes, which usually involve dumping some kind of vegetable and cheese on cooked pasta in various combinations (yes, really). But the kicker was a ""vodka pasta"" recipe which LITERALLY involves dumping 1/2 cup of vodka on cooked pasta and eating it like that. WHAT KIND OF RECIPE IS THAT? Vodka is not a pasta sauce. My husband thought it was a joke, I thought it was important to warn others. On the good side, they do have some basic recipes for tomato sauce and bechamel sauce if you don't know how to make these already."
2,Not worth the price,"This is an ok monitor. It seems to have good range and even has a nightlight feature you can use in the room but it has terrible feedback and goes through batteries like crazy. If I leave it plugged in, the feedback is ten times worse and so loud! Using just the batteries we can use it maybe one night and a few naps the next day. To make matters worse, there is no low battery indication so many times it has died on me and meanwhile the baby has been awake and crying for sometime. Now I feel like I have go upstairs and check on him every 5 minutes while he naps. For this much money, it should at least warn you when the batteries are low. Got out of the shower today to find it had died again. That's the last time, we're getting another monitor."
2,Batteries not effective; noticeable static,"We bought the Graco Ultraclear II as an inexpensive monitor with batteries that got great reviews here on amazon.com. While the monitors did work, there were 2 major drawbacks.One is that the 4-AAA batteries only let the parent unit run off the charger for a few hours. This seems to be a defect as the batteries were not very used up when they were removed. If you want to move the parent unit from room to room, be prepared to have to move the plug (or burn through $$$ on batteries).Two is that while you can hear what is going on in the room, we also got a lot of static on the monitor. There was much more static than our old monitor.We ended up returning the unit to Graco without any problems. I would suggest a unit with rechargeable batteries."
2,Lots of static noise after 3 months of use,"A friend gave us this monitor as a gift. It worked great at the beginning, but after about 3 months we had a lot of static noise on either channel. Sometimes we could hear our neighbor's baby on one channel. Now, whatever we do, we cannot hear our baby anymore but just static noise, or eventually the neighbor..!It workd great for the first 3 months but now I am just goin to trash it as it's not working anymore. I am going to get the Angelcare Baby Sound Monitor, it got great reviews and NO static!!"
1,Only worked for 6 months,"I bought this monitor and at first really liked it, but after a few months the connection on the transmitter started getting very finicky, if it wasn't at just the right angle it wouldn't stay on. It was very frustrating because I would get it just so, leave the room and then half an hour later my receiver would suddenly play static because the transmitter had just disconnected, and now my baby was asleep and I couldn't go in to fix it. Eventually it got worse and worse until it would only work if I was holding the cable... so it was useless. I didn't rough it up or anything, I just had it on her shelf so it wasn't a very sturdy product. Another thing I never really liked even when it did work is that the sounds were always very loud, there is a volume control but at the lowest sound it was still very loud and magnified."
5,love it. I hear everything,I love this one. I was reading tons of reviews and this one looked like it was the best. the price was great. I used it now for the past 4 month and never had a problem.I have to turn it all the way down because I can hear my son every time he moves. love it !
4,Love It!,"This monitor holds up to its reviews. It does drain batteries quickly so it isn't great for using outside a lot unless you can plug it in. Otherwise, I LOVE this monitor. It is ultra sensitive to my child and not background noise. My son is almost 2 and I still use it and have used it every day since he was just weeks old. I would highly recommend this monitor to anyone!"
1,Constant humming noise,"We have used two other monitors before (in the same location that we had these) and never had any problems with humming. These, however, constantly made a humming noise that was impossible to ignore. You could even hear it when watching TV, so it wasn't a quiet hum or one that could be easily drowned out. We returned ours."
1,Interference rendered it useless,"The Graco Ultra Clear II on both offered channels had so much interference that it was rendered useless. If you have a lot of electronics around, stay away from it. I wonder why they call it ""Ultra Clear"".... hmmmm....Sending it back."
2,I would not recommend this one,I bought this monitor for my daughters room. All I hear is a buzzing static. It is even worse if there is anything plugged in near it. I had to unplug everything near it in her room to tame down the static. I hate this monitor and now I have to spend money on a new one.
5,Love it.,I love this bouncer. My son has two of them so we switch. It only vibrates-doesn't play music. The little frog plays a quick tune. It is comfortable for him to sit in--he's two months.
1,It's a nightmare,"My mom got this 1 the whole house didnt get any sleep so she got upset and so we were all upset, finally my mom got a fisher price 1, what a release we got some sleep"
2,Constant noise,"This product works ok, not great. Heavy interference with my cell phone or other items, even worse when my cell is unplugged and only the cell phone charger is plugged in. Uses regular batteries which is nice, no need to worry about recharging (but you need to keep spare batteries on hand). Works great in my kitchen, but not in my bedroom."
4,Great reception/light weight,"Just got this a few days ago in preparation for our 2nd child. I plugged in the monitor in the bedroom and one receiver in the living room to see how well it worked, and it works great! The TV was on in the living room which I could clearly hear in the monitor, then had my daughter pretend to cry and make noise and that's when the lights came on signifying ""baby activity,"" which is what you should expect. The background noise was not overbearing, and there was no static. We live in a small house, so not sure how well it would do from a distance further from the base, but at small range its been great. It is very lightweight without batteries in it, so it easily topples over when plugged in. I'm giving it a 4 because although my test run went well, I'm yet to see how it does for a longer period and with an actual baby. Overall, I'd say great price for the quality."
3,Ok but ...,"The monitor is ok, no interference so far and the 2 receiver is a good solution. But the sound is not very loud (problem that can be minimized if you point the mic to the baby - but is needed to block the strong green light w/ a black tape) and because of that you need to leave the volume as high as possible sometimes (and a zzzzzzzzzz stays on forever).Before this one I had a Sony Babycall NTM910 that have some really nice features not available on this Gracco: built-in rechargeable battery, voice activated (no sound on the reciever while the baby is quiet) - but the interference was a problem.PS1.: I do listen wellPS2.: After a few weeks the interference appeared. I live in the city, in a apartment, w/ a lot of ""neighboors"" around. May be in the suburbs the problem wouldn't exist."
1,Garbage,After 4 months it just broke. Also it was also very noisy. Just garbage! Do yourself a favor and buy anything else.
1,Not what I expected,"I am a full-time caregiver and I bought this to monitor the bedroom where my uncle sleeps so I can hear him during the night if he needs anything. All I got was static, and could hear a woman talking to her friend what is unusual about that is we live in the country and I should not be able to hear someone's conversation. Anyway, I tried for 2 hours and could not get the static to go away so I shipped it back and went to Radio Shack and bought their cheapest 2 room intercom and that solved my problem.I am not saying this baby monitor is not for you, it just did not work for me."
2,Way too much static - I'm replacing it.,"With it's two parent units, I really wanted this monitor to work well for us, but the static is intolerable. For now, I am just keeping the house very quiet when baby is in his crib. I'll be replacing this monitor soon. Also, the battery case is quite difficult to get into, and the set feels really cheap because of it. Upon further consideration, I would much rather have a monitor with rechargable batteries anyway, but this review is based on the static. I'm giving it two stars because about 20% of the time the static isn't so bad."
5,great product,"Purchased this baby monitor for use in my home. Babysit for my grandchildren during the week while Mom works. My youngest grandson is 4 months , I put this monitor in the room near his crib and I can keep track of him at all times. The monitor is very clear , no static and picks up all sounds. Just be sure you have the same channel on all the monitor and both receivers. I highly recommend this product. And I received it in just a couple days , Amazons service was great."
5,Definitely buy this,"This monitor is fantastic! I can't figure out where all these complaints about static are coming from - it's no more static-y sounding than a conversation on a speakerphone. If you can hear static, turn it down a little bit and put it somewhere where you can see the lights. We are buying another set of them because they are so good, and with an upstairs/downstairs it's easier to have two monitors (one each level) and four parent units. We love that they don't *have* to use batteries - it's way easier to plug them in and know that they are always working.In an air conditioned room, you could barely hear the tinkling music from the pack-and-play while you were standing right next to it; however, this monitor picked up the music loud and clear and broadcast it to the receivers. I came downstairs and couldn't figure out where the tune was coming from for a second... now THAT'S impressive!"
4,Graco Ultra Clear II 49MHZ Baby Monitor,Very good. The closer monitor is very quiet. The one placed in a room further away has some background noise but it is not bothersome. Picks up sounds from the main source very well.
5,Works Great,I would say the product works perfectly. Absolutely no static. Both parent units can be either battery operated or plug in.
5,Much better than Fisher Price,"We bought these to replace our Fisher Price monitor which gave us much too much static. You can put batteries in these as well, allowing for more mobility while you listen. With this monitor, I can walk around my yard while my baby sleeps and can hear as clearly as if I was in the next room. This is a quality product and well worth the price, which is no more than our previous monitor which was a piece of junk."
2,Static after a year,We bought this monitor a year ago and it was ok at first. Now that we've had it a year there is enough static to be annoying. We're looking for something different to replace it.
4,Good Monitor,"I purchased this product as a replacement for the previous monitor I had which died on me. I have to say, that it is very good, since it makes no sound at all (at times I thought the monitor wasn't set right, but realized that it really has good reception).The only thing that occurs sometimes is that it has a little static (but I think this is due to the electrical wiring of the house as this is VERY ocassional). I would definitely recommend this product for all new and existing parents wishing to purchase something at a very good price."
4,better then nothing,This product is to help me hear my mother get up in the morning. She has alzheimers and is not always stable on her feet. There tends to be static sometimes and not always at the same time. I can still hear her moving around. I wish there was not static ever but this product is better then nothing.
2,returned,We didn't like this monitor. My husband said it was useless. It didn't seem like we could hear anything and there was some static. We sent it back and got the one we really wanted for a lot more money. Happy now.
1,Too much interference (from a sound machine),"We just received this monitor to use in our second baby's room (due to arrive in a few weeks). I hooked it up in my 18 month old's room to test it out so we could see if we liked it before baby #2 arrived. We have a white noise sound machine in our daughter's room, which we have also ordered for the new nursery, and unfortunately the monitor picked up immediately on the interference even though it was on the opposite side of the room. I tried turning the volume down to the lowest option and it was still very audible, with a high-pitched ""squeal"" sound. When I tried switching channels, it got worse.I am really bummed because I liked the other features - the nightlight w/ auto shutoff after 15 mins, the two parent receivers, etc."
1,Very Bad Static,"I was unable to use these as expected because of static. One had low-level continuous static and the other had loud static. It unnerved me listening through the static and I simply stopped trying to use them.This was a regrettable purchase, a waste of money. I don't recommend this product."
4,Fabio,"Very good product.It works weel, and it is very durable.The mais disadvantage is that it is very difficult to put and take off the bateries."
1,Static overwhelms purpose,"This monitor gives off a constant static noise - on BOTH channels. Volume of static is much louder than the sound of my son in his nursery, totally defeating the purpose. I intend to return this and get a different model Graco (the one I had before was the graco imonitor - which lost its ability to hold a charge and thus has to be plugged in at all times, but always left me confident that I knew what was going on in the nursery). The imonitor cost a lot more - I guess you get what you pay for."
4,good,"these are nice. picks up a bit more static than my other set, but these still work pretty good! i bought these for traveling and I'm definitely pleased."
5,"small sturdy, get the job done","I originally got this model because it operates on the 49 MHz band, so it won't interfere with (or receive interference from) wireless internet and microwaves, both of which operate in the 2.4 GHz band (and are ubiquitous in the urban apartment buildings I live). I found the range to be great (I can get good reception two floors and some distance away), and I have had no interference from anything. The receiving end works either with batteries or from a wall outlet, so it can be either portable or stationary, and change at a moments notice. Overall a great unit at a very good price."
2,Repeated Static,"The Ultra Clear II replaced my orginal Ultra Clear which worked great but finally gave in after 2 kids. I assumed the II model would be an upgrade. Both receivers sit in the same place as the original Ultra Clear but emit a repeated static wheeze that fades away every 30 - 45 seconds. It's not too loud, so it's okay when other activities are going on, but needless to say it's bothersome at night when you're trying to sleep. They will be replaced"
4,so far so good,So far this monitor is working great. I needed a second one for child #2 and didn't want to spend too much on it. So far it's been working great and does not interfere with my other monitor.
4,they work just fine,"They have a lot of static, but you don't need the volume cranked up to hear the baby - I could hear him pretty clearly whether he was crying or quietly babbling to himself.I did pick up another monitor on one of the channels. Keep this in mind if you have neighbors with babies. Since the monitor has two channels, I just switched to the other one (and turned the monitor off after naptime so the neighbors couldn't hear my singing/TV/what have you).They still work after a year, and I haven't really even taken very good care of them - they've been loose in suitcases, they've been yanked off of shelves and fallen on hard floors."
5,New baby,"Grace Ultra Clear II 49 Mhz baby monitor very good product, clear voice...........will come back with Graco again"
5,Graco Ultra Clear II Baby Monitor,"These worked clearly and well at a distance. I used them quite often for my newborn. Also, great for later when they are older and outside of the house. You can keep an eye on them when out in the front yard or just in another room playing."
4,"works well, but sometimes make buzzing noise","This monitor works well overall, and it's great that is comes with two receivers. The reception is good throughout the house and the sound is generally pretty good.However, sometimes the receiver makes a buzzing noise. It could just be my house has bad electrical wiring that causes this, but it'd be nice if the thing didn't buzz all night! It's not extremely loud buzzing, but enough to be annoying.EDIT: It is definitely NOT wiring in the house causing the buzzing. Simple test: use battery power! Using only the battery, the buzzing is unchanged."
4,Graco Baby Monitor,"My daughter is very pleased with the monitor. She had complained about her previous one, so I ordered this one from Amazon, so now she feels safe with the baby upstairs."
1,Way to expensive,Go to Lowes and buy it. Costs about $2.50 a bag there. Even Ace Hardware has it for $5 a bag. Can usually find it even cheaper at local supply places.
1,Deserves No Stars! Do not buy for play sand!,"I bought this at Lowe's for my boys' sandbox. It is awful. Pouring it into the box itself seemed like a hazard. We were surrounded by a thick cloud. It is absolutely filthy! I am still looking for Pavestone play sand. It is much cleaner. I bought some at Home Depot, but they only had 6 bags. There is a world of difference. Please do not waste your money buying Quikrete play sand for your kids sandboxes. Quikrete should stick to only making construction materials."
1,Dangerous and then some!,"Horrible, my son broke out in rash for a week after trying this sand. Do not use. Dangerous and harmful. Read spec sheet."
1,Health Hazard,"Bought for classroom sandbox. The students could not enjoy for the cloud of dust and coughing. Their hands became scratched and irritated within minutes. I had to close the sensory table and now have to search for a healthy product. Needless to say, my students and parents are extremely disappointed. Do not buy for child play!"
1,Toxic and dangerous for little ones,"This sand is very unhealthy and can cause Lung Cancer, Tuberculosis, and Kidney Disease, amongst other things. I got this information from the Quikrete website, so they are well aware of the harmful effects of this sand! I'm not sure how these people sleep at night knowing that they are harming thousands of children with their product. Is this legal?"
3,Good writing-over produced,"I love her writing and her voice. Layers of over tracted and over production mask her actual sound. I guess making the album more ""radio,"" friendly works some of the time -but not in this case."
4,Wonderful for ages 4-8,"I have used this tape with the Sunday School classes I have taught. Because of the upbeat style of each song, these appeal to children quite a bit. The only negative is that there is not much variety between the styles of each song (which can bug adults!). However, children in this age group certainly don't seem to mind. These familiar songs are popular with most Bible School and Sunday School music programs, so listening to this tape over and over can help your program. I definitely recommend this compilation."
5,"Finally, I Have Found You","A friend gave me a casette tape that he made for the car. He recorded a song that I wanted to learn at the beginning of the tape.After listening to the song I wanted to learn I let the tape play.Here was an Angel who sang so beautifully and played guitar and piano very well. Who was this Angel and where can I get this recording?I went to a house concert and sure enough there she was. She is as good live as anyone I have ever seen before. Her disc is only an introduction to her many talents. Buy this disc and check out her new band, ""Mad Agnes."" Where she is joined by Mark Saunders and Adrienne Jones. They all play guitar, sing, trade off bass playing and Margo also plays keyboards. Truly amazing, and I have this disc to thank for discovering them."
4,good markers,I like these markers because they have a broad tip that provides a solid straight line.
5,best note pens in the world,These pens are great for notepads and post-its and stuff of that nature. Absolutely clean and bold.
3,3 Stars for the 7th,"If you are looking for a great 7th then this is the best I have heard, good pace, great rhythm and flow and very beautiful, it has a fresh and direct feel to it. The 8th is average and the 9th is very disappointing, so do not buy this if you are looking for a good all-round set or first Dvorak set. Dohnanyi's Cleveland performances are all magnificent with excellent sound, warmer recordings than Davis - particularly the 9th."
3,"I wanted to like this, but. . .","Davis is a matter-of-fact interpreter of these wonderful scores.The seventh is the best of the lot, but, there are a lot of good sevenths out there; Dohnanyi is not to be missed with the unpareiled Cleveland in terrific sound. His eigth is very exciting, if a little emotionally more remote; however, compared to Davis, it's terrific. Neither can compare to the genius of Walter's recording with Columbia Sym on Sony, though.The ninth here is absolutely nothing special, at all. Again, Dohnanyi gives you a better deal, but so do so many others: Stokowski (RCA), Slatkin (Telarc), Kertesz (Vienna, London), Neumann (various), etc. etc.You do get wonderful playing from the Concertgebouw, and although the engineering is fine, I could never warm up to it.For twice your money, you can probably buy Kertesz's complete set. I wish I had done that!"
4,Davis & Dvorak - Not So Bad,"There are clearly better choices available when it comes to inexpensive 2CD sets of Dvorak's last three symphonies than this title by Colin Davis. In fact, there is even a better one in the very same Philips Duo series -- the one by Witold Rowicki and the London Symphony Orchestra (see my review). Other better buys are the Giulini on EMI Double Forte (not the horridly slow Sony title that was mentioned below), Von Dohnanyi on Double Decca, and Kubelik on DG (see my review of the box set of the Nine Symphonies). With that being said, this set is really not so terrible. I think we all feel a little let down by Davis because so many of his other Philips Duo offerings are among the best of any given work available -- the Complete Sibelius Symphonies, Haydn ""London"" Symphonies and Beethoven Piano Concertos to name a few. Oh well, you can't hit a home run at every at bat."
2,Not so hot.,"If the 'official review' is right, then save your $, because Davis' 7th isn't exciting. He doesn't give powerful performances, which makes me autmatically suspicious of his reputation as a Berlioz conductor. The best modern interpretation I've heard is not Dohnanyi's, but Giulini's (on Sony)."
5,More wonderful Brahms from an energized young Haitink,"Bernard Haitink can be a cautious, unimaginative condcutor, more so as he aged. But this Brahms Fourth from 1972 is sweeping, energetic, and full of lyricism. It stands out for excellent analog sound and the gorgeous sonority of the Concergenouw, also. There is such depth of tone to go with Haitnik's depth of feeling that I was carried away--as I have been by all of his early Brahms from the Seventies. If anything, this installment is actually the least extraordinary; the First, Second, and Third are especially magnificent. All told, this CD goes to the top of my list for a bargain Brahms Fourth and equals Carlos Kleiber as best of all in modern sound."
1,Obviously returned by others!,"The price was right, but this item was returned immediately after opening. The box had no packing material! It was unrecognizable as even being a desk accessory! The wood was of inferior quality. Pay a little more, and buy something else!!! I did!!"
4,Disappointing if you read Spoiled: Foodchain Gone Haywire,"This is just the original book with a new title and a new short introduction. I thought the hardback was very good, an important, well-researched book, but it lacked even a chapter devoted to what one could do to effect changes ie: names, addresses of organizations working to correct some of the problem areas she comments on. I bought this book, based on the title, thinking Fox had rectified what I felt was the major fault with the original text; I was disappointed to discover nothing had changed except the title."
2,poor recording,"Its a poor recording, meaning that I can't hear what are they singing (words, intonations, etc.).Also terrible accent of singers (not all, but still) which destroys general impression. IMHO Russian opera should be either performed by a Russian singer or there should be no accent."
1,It MIGHT have worked if...,"The ENTIRE cast had been replaced.We've all seen similar stories before. Some things about the cinematography were strong, while other scenes were so contrived that I wound up adding my own lines after a bit; a habit picked up from years of Mystery Science Theater and Monty Python: the only way of making it through a brutally ridiculous movie. I'm a Lovecraft fan, too, but I've never read this story.If this idea had been handed to a competent group of actors, it'd probably be decent, but Dr. Munoz and his performance were the most transparent I've seen in a long time. If this one's in your local rental kiosk, and you like to toss a few lines into a bad movie during supposed ultra-dramatic moments, grab it!As far as I can tell, the cover is the most frightening thing with this one."
2,Lovecraft Adaptation,"The screen writers have taken the liberty of placing this in modern times. The story is grime and keeps the basics of the Lovecraft horror. This could have been a greet horror classic if not for the stilted; or dare I say it, poor acting. The budget was obviously limited as will be noticed by the very limited sets and props. I mean the white van looks like it was rented for the day and had mud on it too make it look like a long neglected vehicle. When the acting does not capture your attention like in this film you start too notice things like that. I will not give away the plot for those who have never heard of the storyline. I am glad I saw it but happy I only paid $2. This is a movie that will only get the one viewing from me. My suggestion; borrow it."
2,Why 95% of H.P. Lovecraft's stories end as a bad movie?,"Based upon H.P. Lovecraft's story Cool Air, Chill is yet another in a long line of lackluster attempts to capture the other-worldly creepiness of an author who was way ahead of his time. The movie have a lots of problems for the begining of the production. First the director Serge Rodnunsky does not possess the skills to get decent performances out of his cast. The only two actors in this otherwise train wreck of a film who come off as convincing are Ashley Laurence and and Calabro. The make up is horrible and I know this is a low budget movie, but definitely they kill this production. And if you make it to the film's finale, you'll be rewarded by seeing what has to be the single most laughable CGI-rendered explosion that I've ever witnessed. In other words this could be a good movie if the production crew and the director were more careful."
1,Disappointed... :(,I was really looking forward to reading this book because I'm a huge King Arthur/Merlin/Guenevere fan and I wanted to know some historical facts behind the supposed legend. I read the first 100 pages and got so confused and bored I had to stop reading and I'm not one to start a book and not finish it. I couldn't follow what she was writing about. I understand that she has several degrees and is fluent in many languages and is obviously very intelligent but I found the book to be extremely hard to follow. The first chapter was dedicated to the origin of Merlin's name. Well it's clear she spent a good amount of time researching this topic but frankly I don't really care where his name came from. I think I'm just going to stick with the stories and skip the facts.
2,"Interesting facts, lousy writing","Goodrich claims that Merlin was a Celtic Christian scientist, political advisor and religious leader. She may well be right. Indeed, I would like to think that she is right. But if I disagreed with her conclusions, her arguments would not convince me. As other reviews of her writing have said, it is full of non sequiters. I have a Ph.D. in religious studies, and teach religion and philosophy. But I could not explain to a third party her arguments for her conclusions. If you want some exposure to ancient/medieval texts that bear on the identity of Merlin, this book might be useful. But don't expect to come to any clear conclusion (for or against her views) with the help of her writing. She mixes textual exposition and argument without stating where one leaves off and another begins. The reader is constantly wondering: is this what her sourse says? Is it what Goodrich THINKS it says? Is it evidence for her point of view? If so, how? A tangle of confused writing."
1,Merlin's Grass is NOT Pleurisy Root,"On page 24 Ms. Goodrich talks about Merlin's Grass, which she says is from the Asklepios (sic) family & she says Merlin's Grass (Quillwort) is also pleurisy root & Butterfly weed. Unfortunately she is wrong. Isoetes lacustris (lake quillwort or Merlin's grass) is a boreal Quillwort Lycopodiaphyte. Butterfly Weed is from the plant genus Asclepias (this is the correct spelling)& is Asclepias tuberosa, also called pleurisy root. So Quillwort/Merlin's Grass is not Butterfly Weed/Pluerisy Root. They are two different plants, Quillwort being an aquarian pond plant, that looks like grass, with no flowers & Butterfly Weed, being an herb, with orange flowers used as a tea & treatment for congested lungs."
4,It's funny to see this album on Amazon!,"This is Deja Voodoo's first album. Deja Voodoo are a gonzo-metal band whose members used to be on the cult TV show 'Back of the Y.' There are quite a few swear words, and 'Feelings' is rather offensive to female listeners, but I like it anyway. It's certainly a good album to get drunk to."
2,Three Painful Weeks to Read,"I usually tear through a good book in a day--it took me three weeks to get through Utopia. It was a great story idea and I wanted to like it--didn't want to give up on it because I have always thoroughly enjoyed the books of Child and Preston. I begin to suspect that it may have been Preston's writing I was enjoying. Every once in a while, I would see a glimmer of something exciting starting up in the story and I would think, ""Ah, ha, now it gets good."" A page or two later, I would find my mind once more wandering through dry narrative. The novel lacked flow and I found the characters to be flat and uninteresting. I just skimmed the last few pages--just didn't care anymore."
4,Very good but can do better,"Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child together write the best techno-thrillers in the world and this solo effort by Child is a great example of what the pair are capable of but unlike their joint works this does seem to have a touch of ""been done before"" about it. It's a great read, the characters are fine and the technology aspects are, as usual, outstanding and one of the highlights but whilst reading the story it does bring to mind quite a few other books and films which can never be a great thing. I really recommend this book but I wouldn't swap it for any of my Preston-Child collaborations and I can't wait for the new one in the summer."
4,Not a disappointment.,"A less-than-glowing title, perhaps, but it's very true: Utopia is not a disappointment, even if it also isn't a stunning and revelatory novel. If you like Lincoln Child, and/or techno-thrillers and mystery as genres, then you'll enjoy Utopia. What's particularly enjoyable? Novel ideas and research that was new to me (and I'm fairly nerdy) re: computer science, entertainment parks, and artificial intelligence."
5,A Must Read,"Utopia is the new Westworld! Not to be confused with the classic of the same name, Utopia is a white-knuckle thrill ride from beginning to end."
3,Produce Man,Hard to stay with this book. I have read all of the other books and this one seemed to drift.Really liked the idea of the theme park and all of the detail. Someone should build a theme park like Utopia.The ending was very predictable but fun in a way.
3,Enjoyable Action/Predictable Ending,"This book is 430 pages of well-paced, interesting, enjoyable action that is marred considerably by the fact that the reader will see the ending coming from about 300 pages away. After the first 100+ pages, it's obvious who the 'inside guy' is and you can make a pretty good guess on how various characters' skills and personalities will play out in the story's culmination.It seems that predictability is common in Child's works - so if you aren't bothered by it in his other books you'll like this one. If, on the other hand, you want your mysteries to remain mysterious throughout, don't expect too much from this."
3,Good entertainment,"I have been a fan of Lincoln Child for many years through his collaboration with Douglas Preston. Utopia is an interesting story with decent character development and very interesting plot. I found the ending a little rushed, but still entertaining."
1,Hated it,"I always feel compelled to finish a book once I start, but I have about 15% to go and am considering bagging it. I usually love Lincoln Childs, and usually his books are real page turners, but this book is BORING..."
5,Utopia,"Another wonderful book from the author Lincoln Child. Have been a great fan of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child books for many years. I am not disappointed with their solo efforts either. In Utopia you are there, in amongst it all as you read."
2,Still haven't finished this one,"It seemed to start out OK - but got too ""Westworld"" for me - definitely not one of my favorite Child's story. Maybe one day I'll finish it."
3,Very Crichton like.,"Could not put it down. Will read more of Mr. Child‘s work. Could have used more Tech, but it was written in 2000 ."
5,GREAT BOOK FAST READ,"An amusement park thriller anyone could love. Great characters and a must read, I couldnt put this one down. It grabs you from the first page and keeps you going till the very end. It kept me wondering whats going to happen next. A ""Die-hard"" type book anyone whos into action will love."
2,200 pages too long!,"Bottom line: This is a below average novel that quickly becomes tedious because the narrative is mostly fluff. This book could have been much more enjoyable if 200 pages of useless descriptions were removed. Note to the author, it is ok to let the readers use their imagination.Pros: interesting and ruthless villains; cool concept for a future theme park in Nevada near Las Vegas (I'd go).Cons: overly wordy by 200 pages; weak and uninteresting protagonists; cheap imitation of R2-D2 type robot.Alternative Lincoln Child book: Try ""Deepstorm""; it is much more interesting and fun to read."
2,"Lincoln Child, what were you thinkning?","I read all of Lincoln Child's books including the ones he wrote with Doug Preston and by far this one is the absolute worst. Just because he can write, publisher shouldn't allow him to write a crap. I understand that he had a good storyline with a few interesting characters but taking a page out of Die Hard isn't what I expect from a top notch writer like Lincoln. Don't write a Hollywood movie script, write a book. Don't sell out like John Grisham."
3,Drags a bit,"The premise of the story is a good one...and captivated me. I did find the writing a bit...long winded and drawn out. The book drags in the middle as the story unwinds. Good ending, but a LONG read to get there."
4,"A very fun, action packed read","I am such a huge fan of Preston-Child books. I decided to read this solo booking hoping that it would not disappoint me. It did not! I throughly enjoy this read. Who would have thought a high tech amusement park could hold so much drama? The story line was wonderful and very action packed...i could not put this book down.I also enjoyed how the author fully painted a picture in my mind of this story. I definitley felt like i was there and could visualize everything that was happening.If you have never read a Preston or Child book, this book will set you down the right path to becoming an avid reader of these books. Trust me, you wont be disappointed."
3,Utopia: A thriller,"I feel I am being generous on giving this book three stars. It just kind of dragged along with detail and descriptions of the theme park, and was rarely nail biting, edge of your seat stuff. I ending up skipping passages as they were just not really relevant to the story development. Interesting concept, though, so I guess that kept me going. Child certainly has a broad imagination. Cheers to that! Christie"
4,A solid read,A good entertaining read. Typical of Child. It's definetely a page turner and a well written thriller. Highly recomended for those that like a technical thriller...
3,what a ride,"What a fun ride (pun intended). I'm not going to say this was a work of brilliance or cataclysmic achievement, but it kept me up at night turning the pages. It is fast paced...once the basic plot has been formed and just speeds up from there. It had its cliche' moments but I can forgive that because it was well done. I am also sure there were plot holes and I did figure out one of the ""whodunits"" before it was revealed but this was the kind of book you shouldn't really focus too hard on the ""science"" and just go along with it. Recommended for those who enjoy the author and for those wanting a bit of mindless reading."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"What can I say? I was somewhat disappointed by this book; it is not up to the usual standards of the author [but it IS an earlier volume in his output, etc/]."
4,Great Read,Lincoln Child is a fantastic writer. He doesn't insult your intellegence and keeps the pace of the book brisk and refreshing.Highly recommend... Hard to put down...
4,as good as the book,"This review will be brief. If you liked the book, you'll like the CD. The reader does a fantastic job with the characters nailing down the voices regardless of gender or nationlity. If you want it free, go to you public library and check it out. That's what i did. :)"
2,What a boring waste of time.,"I picked this up because I really like the collaborative works between lincoln child and preston douglas. I was very disappointed in this story. There was lots of description of the theme park, but little depth in the characters and an extremely thin plot with almost laughable situations. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one. Whoever the reviewers are who enjoyed this book must have read a different book with the same title. I will continue to read the works written in collaboration with Mr. Douglas, however."
4,Roller coaster ride with a lot of fun,I have read several of his books and they all are page turners and keep you guessing. The action keeps going and you never know what to expect next. He is a good thriller author.
5,A fun well-written adventure,I bought this book simply by the description but I thouroughly enjoyed it!This is an inventive world that the author places you in w/ engaging characters. Some might argue it is a bit predictable but I did not feel led along. I enjoyed getting to the end.The format in using time for each chapter was a nice touch.I highly recommend this book. What a fun read.
4,Bad news from Polaroid,"I love my MIO camera and the crisp, fun-sized photos it takes (they're absolutely perfect for photographing your shoes and sticking on the shoe boxes...), but like most people, I've had an incredibly hard time finding the film. I called Polaroid today and they said it is no longer available in stores and that ""management"" is making a decision on what to do in the future. In other words, my 3-month-old camera may be useless soon. If you're planning to purchase the camera, don't - you might not be able to get film for it. Sorry :("
5,GOOD NEWS FOR POLAROID MIO LOVERS,I really enjoyed my MIO Camera/Film and was very disappointed in Polaroid when they discontinued the MIO camera & film. I received rave reviews every time I pulled the camera out and began snapping photos. I also researched and found claims that Fuji Instax Mini Film worked in the MIO. I tried and it works great! The colors are brighter and seem to be more vibrant than the Polaroid MIO film. Maybe one day Fuji will bring their line to the US. One can hope.........
3,Hard to find,"I love this Camera, I got it as a Christmas gift, but find it so hard to get film for. No stores in my area sell it, and now Amazon is out of stock on it. Why?"
4,An altogether nice Tosca,"All singers do their task sufficiently good. Montserrat Caballe is the best choice for Floria among the recordings made during the `70s &`80s (R. Scotto, K. Te Kanawa, K. Ricciarelli, M. Freni). Her rich, creamy voice (one of the most beautiful soprano voices indisputably) , her perfect breath control combined with those supreme legatos produce a very nice Tosca. However, even my beloved Montserrat cannot be compared with Renata Tebaldi's Tosca..Tebaldi is so grand and powerful, the ideal Tosca for me!Jose Carreras is a deeply moving Mario (among the best) and he surely is in better shape here as some years later with K.Ricciarelli. I also like the rest of the cast who together with our main singers produce this very satisfying edition of Puccini's masterpiece."
5,BETTER THAN CALLAS/DI STEFANO?,"I dare say yes! Jose Carreras' voice is at its best. He is really Cavaradossi. Caballe too is very good. She doesn't just sing the notes, she sings the emotions: from one who trully loves Mario to jealous woman to a desparate woman who will do anything (including kill) for her man. And her diction is good here- unlike on some of her other recordings. And I believe Igvar Wixell's Scarpia is better than Gobbi's on the worshipped EMI set. The Scarpia death scene is very realistic. You can feel him die. On EMI you just have to beleive he dies. One caveat though: There is NO libretto/translation with this recording. But finding a Tosca libretto is no problem."
2,Not the right thing at all,"Tosca has had tons of great recordings, more than any other Puccini opera. You can hear Callas, Price in her prime or just past, Nilsson, Scotto, Freni, and Tebaldi, all imbedded in good-to-great performances that ooze Italian style.Not this one, though. Caballe and Carreras made a natural pairing, but she is too phlegmatic for the fiery diva Puccini had in mind, and the mircrophones can't really boost Carreras enough to make him a heroic tenor on the scale of Cavaradossi. Wixell is a terrible Scarpia, rough and without a clue to Italian style. Davis favored him in quite a few recordings, a mystifying choice given how Wixell marred all of them. The Royal Operaorchestra can't remotely match any of the great orchestras on disc.But the real problem is Davis, whose talent doesn't extend to Italina opera. After this flirtation and an equally awkward La Boheme he backed out of this repertoire, for good reason."
3,rediculous when compare to Callas,"Callas is the only Tosca, Caballe should stick with Norma or her other fabulous many roles. She is not a good Tosca, perhaps it's the lateness of the recording? Don't think I don't think Caballe is a great, great singer, but next to Callas or La Stupenda Joan Sutherland, she is only second, or third best, really. But still one of the best of our time. No one singing now can match her. But who can compare to Sutherland in the voice department, and Callas in the heart department? Get real."
4,Politics of population control,"When one wants a history of how the modern world is shaped, too often it is found in boring academic books or in lurid conspiracy theory language.This book gives a thoughtful discussion of the whos, whys, and hows of the social policies that aided the idea of population control, with its intended consequences of increasing wealth and security, and its unintended consequences of undermining family life.For information, I rate it a five. It is a clear and well written discussion of this often controversial topic. Unlike the more politicized books of this nature, it is not an exciting read. However it is clearly written so the average reader would find it helpful."
4,Another great Aussie band,"Eskimo Joe, just like their name, are cool. They write short, catchy, alterna-pop-rock songs, and deliver them very capably. From Perth, W.A., Australia, they have only been around for one album so far (the album is called ""Girl""), but the album, if you can find it, is great. Not heaps of variety, but enough to keep you interested.The songs you find on this CD-single are a great introduction to the band, and a great indication of what you'll find on the album."
2,It wont stay together,"My cousin got this toy for my now 18month old. She's had it since she was about 14 months. Since then the only play value she has from it is to pull off the roller coaster loop and wear it as a necklace, and she will bring the ferris wheel into the living room and put the people on it and turn it around but that was only just recently. It's a big toy that takes up a lot of space for one that is hardly used. I wont give it away as she does enjoy the ferris wheel and the little people and the red ""necklace"" but now the cars wont do the loop anymore because the loop has been pulled off so many times."
1,Probably want to let this one pass,"I bought this despite some of the negative reviews the risk did not pay off. The loop coaster which was the big draw for me is neat, but the loop tends to fall apart. Also it requires a bit more coordination than my 2 year-old can sometimes muster to set the cars correctly on the hook and track. The Ferris Wheel doesn't stay in place very well at all and the plane ride is hard for her to grasp and manipulate. A much better bet is the Surprise Sounds Fun Park which has essentially the same elements (it's not a loop coaster, but at least it stays together) except with sound. The knob at the top of the rocket ride is easy for her to grab and move by herself, also she can work this coaster toy completely on her own which she and I both love. A Ferris Wheel toy can be bought separately which is cooler looking with lights and sound and since it stands alone there's no problem with it constantly falling out of place."
1,Little People Not So Fun Park,"I purchased this toy through the Pampers Points program, so I can hardly gripe about the price ($4.95 s/h). However, it has not been a sturdy toy and has made its way to the trash. The arch over the track would not stay up; it becomes a natural handle for little ones and for whatever reason, seemed to affect the performance of the track. Our cars just wouldn't stay on the track. We've kept the people and the cars, but that's it. It was not the quality of our other Fisher Price toys."
2,Would not buy again.,I was very upset with this toy. I run a daycare in my home and thought the kids would love this but everything pops off easy. The loop comes off all the time and the cars do not go all the way around on the loop either. You can not keep the farris wheel or the merry go round on this product. If they pick it up by the top of the roller coaster hill it will come off. It is not a toy that is played with.
2,Save your money,"We got this one free with paper's points. If I knew then what I know now, we would not have selected it. It falls apart easily - the hill pops off, the door falls in and the loop can be easily snapped off. It's only redeeming value is the people and the little cars that come with it. The playset itself is a wreck."
3,Easy to take apart,"My son got this for his 2nd birthday. He loved it at first when I showed him how to properly use it. But, after a few weeks he figured out how to take the track off and also wear it around his neck & put it on mommy's head too. He rarely uses the ferris wheel or airplane ride, mainly becuase they're too easy to take off the base. If they made it so you can screw all the rides and track onto the base it would be better. I think I will try that myself. I agree that the people don't stay on the planes when you spin it. He did learn how to loop the car on the hook & press the button to let the car go."
4,Fun for the little ones,"My kids like to play with this toy, but get frustrated trying to ""set"" the car on the hook for take off. It also disassembles too easy and I am constantly having to reattach pieces, they do not break, but just come apart easily. I do not regret the purchase, however, as I really think it is a cute toy and the kids love it when the cars pop out. My kids are 1 and 3 and both love it!"
2,Not what you'd expect from Fisher Price...,"I bought this toy for my 18 month old. After a rather simple assembly process, I noticed my son had more fun pulling the toy apart. The roller coaster is rather flimsy and came apart very easily. The ferris wheel does not stay in place and was quickly discarded. Even my 5 year old who loves all toys got bored with it. Maybe my 18 month old was not mature enough to grasp the dynamics of the toy but I myself have been Fisher Price fan since the early seventies and I have never seen a more poorly constructed product. I returned the toy to the store for a refund."
4,It is really fun,"I really liked this toy, except the loop should have already been there. With hard play it kept popping off. All and all though a really great toy."
3,A great idea - but it doesn't hold up,"I bought the original park for my then 2 yr old. She played w it for awhile but the coaster only works with the guy in it & then only sporadically, then it got dirt & dust & wouldn't work @ all. I loved little people as a kid but the new playsets are so cheap. They don't stay together & the pieces are easily lost. I was disappointed. I expected more from Fisher-Price."
3,Don't bother unless you like fixing things,"I bought this for my son & it is constantly falling apart. The ferris wheel can't be turned without if falling out of place & then you have to hold it with one hand & turn with the other. Little kids just don't get this. The cars usually fall off the track & don't complete the loop de loop. If you tried it 10 times it would probably work 2 times. The track also comes apart easily. I do like the storage area for the cars & people. The people are very durable & safe. I've always been a fan of the little people, as I have a huge collection from my childhood, but why can't they make them like they used to? Built to last. This track will probably go in the trash within 1 year of buy date."
2,fisherprice fun park,"My daughter loved playing with the people and the cars. She didn't have much interest in the big structure because the cars would fly off and the door they would go through kept coming off. The Fun Park is a fairly large toy, I would rather have one that she has more interest in."
1,Max and JJ's opinion,"This toy is very attractive, but it's a pain. The circular part of the track never stays in place and is always somewhere else in the house besides where the toy is. Also, the part that drops the cars onto the track also falls off easily. Small children don't know how to reattach the parts to you are constantly putting it back together. The ferris wheel detaches constantly also and the merry-go-round flings the people out. Totally frustrating toy for small children and it is usually ignored, in pieces, and I personally hate the thing. We all love the other toys, (ie. farm, house, fire dept) but this one falls below expectations in a major way. We suggest you buy another toy. :("
3,The roller coaster that wouldn't.,"Although my 2 year old occasionally played with this toy, he found out early he could remove the track simply. Do this a few times and the track doesn't hold true anymore and the cars won't make the loop...if Six Flags had these kind of problems with their roller coasters, they'd be out of business. Well, once the roller coaster wouldn't work, it became a source of frustration for him and we had to remove it from his room. The other 'rides' didn't interest him very much, and he much prefers the old stand by of his farm, schoolbus, and city."
2,Waste of space and money!,"This set looks like a lot of fun, but it is just not all I expected, nor what my kids like. The parts come off way to easily (ie: the ferris wheel and swings), the cars do not do the loopydyloop very well, leading to frustration, you have to get it on JUST RIGHT and even than...it doesn't usually work, even for an adult. This toy is hardly ever played with, it lost its appeal the week that my daughter got it for her first birthday a year ago and has hardly been touched since. Usually the little people sets have been a winner, but this one is not worth the money and space it takes up. Unfortunately it is rather large, and when a toy that large is not played with...well I consider it a waste of space. The Little People Farm set is played with on regular basis as well as the bus and safari set. We have the sets from a few years ago when Fisher price didn't have to put noises on ALL their toys! BUT, that is a pet peave that I won't go into today."
2,Not up to Fisher Price's normal standard,This toy is a piece of junk. I bought two. One for my niece and one for my 17 month old. They both loved it for about the first 10 minutes. After that the cars couldn't make the loop & just fell down. The problem is that people don't fit properly into the cars. Because the people fall out-the cars don't weigh enough to manuver the loop.Both had the exact same problem.I usually love the Little People products. This toy is not up to Fisher Price's normal quality.
4,My boys love it!,"We first got this toy when my oldest was 3 (he's now almost 7.) He still plays with it, as do his younger brother & sister. The ferris wheel & airplane ride are really easy to use. It's nice that they remove from the base so 2 kids can play at the same time more easily. My younger kids need assistance with the roller coaster portion; it's difficult for them to line the car up just right & move the gate w/o knocking the car over. That's my only complaint. Fisher-Price quality is evident throughout the product."
2,"Looks fun in the picture on the box, but not as fun to play with","This toy was purchased for a 2 y.o. per the age recommendations on the box, but the design is poor. The loop for the roller coaster snaps into place, which means it unsnaps easily if the child leans on (or falls over it). Each time the loop is replaced, the snap gets looser and looser. Eventually the cars won't make it through the loop. The merry-go-round and ferris wheel are definitely more age appropriate, but for some reason, Fisher Price didn't make them a permanent fixture of the set. As the child tries to load Little People in, the items falls over (if sitting alone on the floor) or falls off of the fun park."
2,Not impressed at all!,this product looks fun but really isn't. my daughter got bored with it after 2 days. the pieces aren't sturdy and there really isn't much for the kids to do. certainly not worth the price either. buy something else!
3,looks like more fun than it is,"Although it looks interesting and the kids are attracted to it, they do not play with it for long periods. Yes, it comes apart, but so does the FP Zoo Train and they play with it endlessly. They also adore the simple FP School Bus much more than this one. The characters have all been moved into the bus! I can't figure out why but both my 2 and 4 year olds much prefer other, simpler FP toys. For the money, it is only marginally okay."
2,Not all that,I still have old Fisher Price toys from my youth and bought this for my twin two-year old daughters. the Ferris wheel does not stay to the disignated area --- we have ours taped down. The product as a whole is not as durable as the old Fisher Price toys were. The girls are not too interested in this toy. Disappointing.
2,Falls apart,"This toy would be great, if only it stayed together. I got it for my 2 1/2 yr. old. The farris wheel comes off so easily, you could blow it off. The rest of it isn't much better. I need some really strong glue."
2,Oh no! If only I would have read the reviews...,"This toy looks great and is described wonderfully. When it is taken out of the packaging, a whole new life it takes on. It falls apart too easily. The pieces aren't as ""friendly"" to a small child as one might expect coming from Fisher Price. Yes, the figures are as usual awesome, but the moving parts (the ferris wheel and roller coaster) fall apart and are confusing for small minds to grasp. P.S. There is an identical one that I picked up several years ago for my middle child. I wondered why I never saw it much...now I know."
3,Andrew's Loop-D-Loop,My 22 month old son likes to see the cars come zooming out of the clowns mouth. He dose manage to pull the farriswheel and airplane ride off within seconds and discards them to the side. He is all about the cars only.
1,it is a peace of junk,"This toy is useless. This can be a junk a at home, lot of work to parent to gather peieces of the toy.I think even for educational values also very very less, infact it consumes lot of place at home"
3,Schmeh.,"My son is 19 months old and he likes to play with this toy (mostly the little cars and the people) but I have to say that it is a piece of junk. All the parts come off every other minute so I have to keep running over (to the sound of his screaming in frustration) and put the whole toy back together.How annoying. I'm going to return it and get one of the other Little People sets that is more ""tried and true""."
2,Great fun--if it would stay in one peice!!,"My (then 14 month-old) daughter received this toy as a Christmas gift this year. It looks like great fun, but it's full of weird design flaws. My daughter is not tough on her toys, but the track parts pop off at the slightest touch. Also, the cars need to be hung on a hook in order to complete the track. There is a loop on both ends of the cars, but only one is big enough to fit on the hook, so half the time she's trying to force the car onto the hook. In addition, the ""Fun House"" door--where the cars come out--is directly below the where the cars start on the track, so the child's foot is almost always blocking the trap door. (We've had playgroup at our house enough times to see almost every child does this.) It seems like a great idea for a toy, but I wonder how much Fisher Price tested it before they put it on the shelves. I expected more from them."
3,I think this toy is adorable,"The kids don't like it as much as I do. In order for the rolercoaster to work, the car has to be on just right; my 2 1/2 yr. old has too hard of a time keeping the car on the ramp. It keeps falling off.The pieces come apart way to easily. You have to hold the feris wheel in place when you turn it."
2,Wonderful boring toy,"My 18 month old daughter received this as a christmas gift, she loves playing with it when it is taken apart. I think this would be an okay toy for an older child who has imagination. I have been a big fan of little people since the 70's . she is playing with those sets more than the current sets. I put this toy away for a couple years so by the time she is 5 or 6 I would have gotten my money's worth out of this toy."
2,Gets boring quickly,"My daughter gravitates to it in the playroom, but quickly gets bored and moves to another toy. Its great for her coordination because she had to learn to line the car up on the track for it to run the course, but thats about all it does. And once she mastered it, she doesn't spend much time with it all."
2,being nice,"when giving 2 stars. My 16 month old recieved this for christmas. Yes he likes the little people, and he does enjoy the cars and placing the people on the ferris wheel and airplane ride. But, that's it. He repeatly takes off the roller coaster loops and the toy is then useless. They should have designed the loops better. It's a shame. It looks better in the box."
1,Very Disappointing,"I always liked the Little People Cars and Trucks so I decided to get my son this Fun Park. The quality of the plastic is very cheap. It assembled very quickly, but not as quickly as my son tore it apart. The set falls apart very easily. It held his attention for about 3 minutes and this is a child who can spend an hour working on puzzles. I am very disappointed in this toy. Buy the cars and trucks but stay away from this one."
3,Mixed emotions here,While my son thinks this toy is fun (he is 16 mos)I personally think it is annoying. My son only plays with it with me the rest of the time he is throwing the parts around. The roller coaster piece is constantly coming off and the track keeps coming apart as well. I have alot of little people toys here and it seems that this is one of the few toys where the little people characters are not interchangable. If you use some of the characters from other toys (not animals but the actual people)the roller coaster car will just kind of collapse which really stinks. If you want some fun little people toys for your child go with the farm which my son loves.
2,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I PURCHASED THIS TOY WITH MY PAMPERS POINTS LAST YEAR TO GIVE AS A PRESENT TO MY SON. I THREW IT AWAY AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS. NORMALLY I GIVE AWAY TOYS THAT WE NO LONGER USE, BUT I WOULDN'T WISH THIS HEADACHE TOY ON ANYONE. THE ONLY THING HE ENJOYED WERE THE ""LITTLE PEOPLE"" THAT CAME WITH THE FUN PARK. WE STILL USE THE LITTLE PEOPLE, BUT WITH HIS LITTLE PEOPLE FARM. THE FARM IS WONDERFUL - IT IS HIS FAVORITE TOY."
4,interesting,i was a bit iffy when i got it but reading some of it so far i am interested. it gives good explanations on topics of interest such as the church's interpretation of scripture and gives bible references to back it up. if you have time to read or are interested in the scriptural basis this bok is good. its also not too wordy. would definitely reccommend it because i know it will come in handy.
4,Good resource,"The book is divided into chapters (as stated above), almost every one containing suggested reading (and in one part online suggestions). Most are subdivided into pre-1917 or pre-revolution, revolution, and post-revolution parts. Also has good information on current Russian television programs, movies, and periodicals."
3,"Pricey shipping, nice jump rope","The swivel bearing is the best feature of this rope. You can tell that it spins faster and easier than other ropes. If you're used to a leather rope, it may seem a little lightweight at first. I've also read reviews that criticize the plastic ""rope"" for wearing down quickly, which I think it would do if you were jumping on concrete. If you jump on padded or wood floors there will be adequate rope life. Also, the rope takes a while to lose its ""memory"" from being in the box, but after you hang it over a door or something for a few days it's fine. The shipping cost almost prevented me from buying it, but I had a gift certificate so I talked myself into it."
2,Handles Break at Swivel Bearing End!,"For performance,this rope is 5/5 - jump rope is lot easier and the long handles take a lot of strain off the shoulders/back muscles. Unfortunately the construction of the rope is poor, the plastic handles break easily - mine cracked at the bearing end just from casual indoor use. I never dropeed the rope or treated it badly and from normal use the handles broke, bearings came out and now the rope is useless.I will be purchasing the Aero Speed - as I loved the design of Buddy Lee's ropes, and this one has aluminium handles so hopefully they wont crack and break!"
4,Great Rope,"Great rope. I gave it 4 stars as I have not tried every rope out there, but this one is fast and a joy to use. The longer handles with the foam padding are comfortable. As the instructions go slow when you are cutting the rope down to size. I took a half inch off at a time the first few uses to make sure I did not go to short. I still have a few more inches to get rid of for a perfect fit."
2,"Great action, easily broken","When I first started using this rope I was blown away by how much cleaner and faster the rope turned than the others I had tried. But unfortunately, the plastic broke right at the insert between the rope screw and handle after only a month of casual use. I returned the rope for a new one, which broke in the same way after only two trips to the gym. The problem is that the rope starts to unscrew itself from the handle, which puts tremendous shearing force on the weakest part of the plastic handle as you rotate it up and down. I read something about applying a thread lock, which may be a solution. I can't believe such an expensive rope from the great Buddy Lee has such a fatal flaw."
2,Not the best of Spike and Mike,"Has few of the humorous bits Spike and Mike's work is famous for. It only has a few clips and these are the more ""dark,"" ""strange,"" ""artsy,"" and some ""stupid"" animation clips that left me feeling ""why did I buy this?"" Where is snow man inside the ""snowy villiage globe"" with an igloo trying to reach the mermaid on the same shelf?"" Where is the ""101 ways to quit smoking?"" How about claymation bit of a man ""assembling"" himself in a room? How about the original Simpsons?"
2,Not classics at all and enough substance for the $$$,"I really miss the days of the annual touring animation festivals and was hoping to recapture some of the joy with this DVD. It is rediculously overpriced for the measly amount of content and these are hardly ""classics,"" excepting of course Bambi Meets Godzilla which should be in everyone's collection. About 25% of Ah Pook is Here is noteworthy, but the best thing about it is William S. Burroughs' voice -- and you can hardly credit the animators for that."
1,SonicWeb supplies,Been looking for supplies for our SonicWeb unit and cannot find any available anywhere. We may end up having to buy a different type of unit. Found that the unit is discontinued . . . maybe there is a connection here?
2,not what I was looking for,"am sure the content for learning is in this series but it's not the main focus. Wanting to exlpore an actual practice to learn from, there was more focus on having an populated event then focusing on the actual moves. It wasn't the experience I was looking for."
5,Replaced broken glasses,I had these ice tea glasses for the past several years. Three of mine had broke and I tried to replace them where I had purchased them but were unable to do so. My internet search was successful and I now have 4 new ice tea glasses
4,Good overall,7 out of 8 arrived in perfect condition. 1 was completely broken. Bubble wrap was only put on top of packed material - none on the bottom! Refund given for broken item.
5,Cristal D'Arques once again delivers!!,"I have used these crystal ice-tea glasses for many years. Adding four moreto my supply will allow 'four more family/friends to put on the feed bag with us""!Great product."
5,The Monster Club.com Guide To Horror,Ms. Duran has created a work of genuis for all movie bluffs.The MCCGTH is one of the three greatest works on horror in the last thirty years.
5,The best book for ACOA's I have ever come across.,"I am a psychotherapist, and have been using this workbook in my groups since 1987. The chapter about feelings is extremely valuable as toolbox and primer about what feelings are and list exactly what feelings exist. The pictures and vignettes are helpful in getting the clients connect to specific experiences in their lives. The letter-writing and other excercises help to focus feelings and events in a way that clients can express and realease powerful emotions. I do not run a psychotherapy group for ACOA's without this book. It is in invaluable aid to help people deal with trauma and to heal."
5,Good pens.,"This is the second box I have ordered from Paper Mate. If you are looking for a pen that can create an impact on your paper note pad, this is the one.I bought my first box based on one of the reviews here and till now I am still very satisfied with the purchase and it is for this reason, a second box has been procured.It is especially useful if you need a writing instrument to draw your audience's attention when explaining to them with a note pad. It has a definite domineering impact. The generous flow of ink from the tip of the marker is just right - creating the impact and not too much so that it does not smudge on the flip side of the paper on which you are using.i would certainly recommend this kind of pen to any one who is in a position of leadership for so he or she needs to make a definite stance with the pen at times."
3,Where's the ink?,"Don't know if these are an old batch of the ""new"" flairs, but the ink flow isn't like the older version."
4,"Fine deal, this lasted me almost a year..","Its a lot of gel, sure, but I think I ordered this last year and here I am, 11 months later. As for the product, its one of the strongest gels out there and it dries to a stiff, hard crunchy coating and it will hold your hair in just about any position you want (yeah your mohawk should be fine). If a spike goes down, simply re-wet and re-style..albeit a bit weaker..:)On that note (why not a perfect 5 stars), if anyone attempts to rub your hair, it will crunch or break the style and if they fan your hair a lot, the gel will flake..so like Fonzi, ""hey!! whoa! don't touch the hair.."" /comb /comb"
1,False Label,Be sure to check you products before you do anything else I ordered this product under the impression that the DVD player was multi region or all region but the product I receved was a region 2 only DVD player and since I am in Iraq I can not send it back so I am stuck with it now thank you very much for not sending what I ordered
3,Item shipped but damaged,"Item shipped promptly, however, the item would not snap into the laptop. Seller quickly resolved the issue via credit."
1,"terrible battery life, avoid","i bought this for the dell inspiron 700m less than a year ago and now it can't even hold its charge for more than 5 minutes. terrible quality, avoid."
3,Compose Design Advocate,Book purchased for our Freshman college student and is being used in her first year studies. Convenient and better priced than the campus bookstore.
4,Two Discs of Fun,"I've never been able to get into Boccherini's symphonies very much -- they strike me as amiable but aimless, never able to summon up the determination to go anywhere. To some extent, the Guitar quintets behave in somewhat the same way, but to me -- perhaps just because of the genre they inhabit -- they seem to get away with it. Certainly, in the hands of Pepe Romero and members of the Academy of St. Marin in the Fields Chamber Ensemble, they come away with pats on the head. Although, as one reviewer noted, they are different and yet sound the same, they are engaging, inventive and for the most part propulsive. Not profound but certainly deeper than fluff, they work on their own terms and these performances show them off in perhaps the best possible light. This is a Philips Duo that is more than do-able. With more choices, I'd rate it 3.5, but the good nature they inspire bumps that up to a 4. Well done."
5,Great Product and Instructional dvd,"Purchasing these Indian clubs and instructional dvd was one of the best moves I've made. The instructional dvd is very well made by Dr. Ed Thomas which makes it easy to learn the Indian club exercises. There are plenty of exercises to learn and you also can create your own when your good enough. I purchased these 2 lbs. Indian clubs for our son (plays varsity football & wrestling) who is already pretty strong. I would say to someone with not a lot of strength to purchase the 1 pounder's for starting out. The Indian clubs are great and well made. This exercise system can really benefit your shoulder range, motion, flexibility, & strength. They also can help to avoid injury due to these benifits from being dedicated to using this system. Your grip, wrists, forearms, etc. will also benefit from these indian club exercises."
2,Motion RX Indian Clubs,"I purchased a set of 1# and 2-1/2 Motion RX Indian Clubs about a year ago. The major problem I have with the Motion RX Indian Clubs is they both weight much less than the stated weight which bothers me. The Motion RX Clubs also dent rather easily as mentioned in a previous review.On the plus side the Clubs are fairly well balanced, and they are easy to control. The DVD that came with the Clubs is adequate. It is limited to a few basic movements. If you are new to exercising with Indian Clubs it will safely get you started.Overall these Clubs are satisfactory for beginners and rehab. I rated the Clubs a two mainly because of the misstatement of the weights."
2,Poor Quality,"DVD was excellent, club came with cracked handle and huge dent and DVD case was cracked. I will get my other clubs from another company. I have little spare time so I find it a hassle to return something. If something comes broken, I usually never purchase another product from that company. I just taped the handle up, but I am not happy about it and feel they should have packed it more protected than they did."
3,Padded Sound and Pokey Tempos,"This is a nice sounding disk. The orchestra is lush sounding and a little overly padded. No surprises here, everything is pretty much done by the book. The main problem is that the tempi lag miserably. The pianist, Peter Rosel, plays the cascading figurations that open the First Concerto's Rondo so slowly that he manages to make the piece sound like a Czerny exercise. The perpetuum mobile figuration is one that Weber used famously (and often), but in both rondos, the slow tempi rob the music of much of its joy. It just doesn't sound the way it is supposed to when played that slowly. He seems a lot more comfortable in the slow movements where lingering over the notes points up Weber's operatic sentimentality beautifully."
2,MLCS router table assembly,"The table is made well and level. The assemply instructions were terrible when it came to attaching it to a standard unisaw table. I don't think I would purchase this brand again, due to the poor instructions."
2,Headache Maker,EEEK! The megaphone is so darn loud and annoying. Of course the kids love playing it over and over and over again. Save yourself the Tylenol and redirect them to a book.
5,Reentry,Excellent book on all of the issues surrounding reentry of prisoners back into the community. Very comprehensive.
5,Colors match great,I purchased this elastic for the Capezio Glisse 102 pointe shoe. The color is a great match for the shoe and the ribbons. It is a wider elastic but the product description was clear on the width so it was no surprise. My daughter didn't mind the wider elastic. We are pleased with this purchase.
4,Great addition to your Christmas CD collection.,"With the exception of the Chipmunk Song, this is a very enjoyable CD. Great addition to your Christmas CD collection."
2,Too boring and with no direction whatsoever,"This is a very boring CD, with no direction whatsoever and no variety. The song with the Chipmunks does not even fit as a fill-in."
1,Didn't work for us!,"We have a huge problem with dogs being walked by our property and then pooping on the lawn and the owners leaving it there. AFter being so tired of picking up poop over and over again, I decided to try this product after pepper didn't really work. This stuff STINKS! Not literally though.I sprayed it and then saw through my window that a dog walker was approaching and the dog pooped RIGHT where I sprayed!!! So can't work too well. I kept trying it over and over again though because I bought it and it was opened and I still have the poop problem with strange dogs randomly walking by our house so I am very disappointed!!!"
4,Modern Dance at its Near Hottest,"I hadn't seen Bourne's ""Swan Lake"" nor knew anything of it before seeing ""Car Man,"" so I had no expectations.And because of that, I found myself either gasping or holding my breath at times. I love modern dance, and was not disappointed. The sensuality and steaminess within the dance only hightened my reaction towards this show. The story is simple to say the least... but then, it's based on a simple opera. This is a dynamite show and definitely worth the attention.(Please note: The review above is for that of the play. I have not seen the actual video noted here. Others' negative critiques may very well be agreeable.)"
4,Most interesting and engaging!,"This is NOT your traditional ballet. It is, however, gripping and entrancing. The dancers are good, and the choreography imaginative. Our attention never wandered.The plot of this ""auto-erotic"" dance thriller is not totally linear, but it is clearly drawn. We are interested in the characters and their interactions. We find considerable beauty as well.My only quarrel with this presentation is the rapid cutting. I wish the camera had been able to linger longer without all the constant motion."
1,Don't waste your money-See the live show,"If you want to see Matthew Bourne's choreography, your in for a major disappointment. The constant pseudo-artsy cutting, jarring close-ups, and poor shots of the dancing make this a jarring and extremely disappointing video. Be warned if you have epilepsy. The fast continuous scene switching will probably induce an episode."
3,Won't smear...,"I bought these markers to use on my dry erase calender that is on my fridge at home. I love how they don't smear, so I can fill in the numbers of the month and then later on add things on it and my palm won't smear the marker. To erase the marker you definitely need a wet paper cloth and then it comes off easily.The only downside I found was that they are VERY fine point tips. The write very thin and lightly so it was a bit difficult to read from a distance.Other than that they are great!"
4,Effective,They work well. No problems at all. I use them for my Game Mat (a product from chessex) they all appear and all erase. on it (it is a manilla sort of color) the yellow is difficult to see.
5,Great markers,"Markers are great, especially when used on a battlemat. Great selection of colors. Very good price, especially given price per marker."
5,best buddy ever!!,i have read almost all of the buddy stories and followed his and his crews misfortunes over the years and this is an excellent conclusion to the whole story.i couldn't stop laughing out loud at this collection of books.it wraps everything up real nice.
2,ugly and lame,The humor and artwork are crude. Bought this based on all the superlative reviews and after a brief read immediately regretted the choice. Have yet to finish it. Find it a chore to look at. Chacun a son gout.
3,Great book for the reliability ignorant,It has been my experience that teaching basic reliability for equipment has been close to impossible. This book has eased the burden for that purpose. It is written clearly and in terms that will not destroy the mathamatically weak.
5,Moving family drama embedded in gripping suspense.,"I've read all of Shapiro's novels, and _Blind Spot_ is far and away her best. There are few writers who can seamlessly combine family drama, mystery, suspense, and the paranormal. Shapiro is one of them. She hammers you with danger and plot turns, but never lets you forget this is fundamentally a story of a mother-daughter relationship in crisis. For her fans (there must be thousands of us), the reappearance of Lindsey Kern from _Shattered Echoes_ is a treat. Highly recommended."
3,Blind Spot Isn't That Great!,"I found this novel in a local bookseller. I have never heard of Barbara Shapiro, so I gave her try and I really didn't care for the novel at all. It started out weird and the ending ended in a strange way. The author talked about psychic experiences and different weird things that were kind of interesting but this book did not have a solid plot. Also it kind of tells you things about this author when she has NO books in print. They all went out of print, probably because of lack of popularity and interest. Sorry Barbara!"
1,major disappointment,"It's small wonder to me that this author's books are out of print. The premise of this novel sounded very interesting. A woman who is a skeptic has to come to terms with a client's apparent psychic abilities, as well as her own daughter's visions which lead to her daughter being charged with murder. Unfortunately, Shapiro managed to take an exciting idea and turn it into a boring, meandering, too lengthy book. The main character was by turns too overanalytical and incredibly naive and unseeing. The book was so slow and scattered that I actually stopped halfway through and scanned the end (and yes, the obvious suspect was the guilty key to the whole thing). Once I've paid money for a book it takes a very bad story to make me not read the whole thing. If you want an exciting paranormal mystery try the Murder in Scorpio series and skip Blind Spot."
1,"Not explained, just ""overviewed""","This book gives you 130 pages of USB overview (which you probably already know) and 200 pages of useless tables of for instance the Pinout for the VGA-cable. As the ""Editorial Revies"" notes this book is ""written in laymans terms"" which I interpret as containing-to-little-specific-info and is much to general to be used for anything but a brief overview."
4,This book is very informative,"I found this book very informative. The previous reviewer is correct in asserting that the appendixes are heavy with interconnection diagrams, but that's part of the value of the book. I have the author's previous work on RS-232 and it's the same thing. It's biggest shortcoming is that there isn't enough information about Windows support for USB. They cleary explain how the Universal Serial Bus works. This book will not tell you how to write programs for USB, or how to build devices, but it will take you under the covers. That's the value and that's why this book is on my shelf."
1,So many typos!,They cound have gotten a sixth-grader to review this for all the stupid mistakes in the copy (about one every 5 pages). They obviously let their draft of the manuscript get out the door without review.
4,A very good intro to the USB world.,"This book did exactly what the title implied. I now have enough info on USB to continue more indepth study of it. I only hope I can find a more advanced book written in such a manner as this book was, making studing easy and fun."

2,DOESN'T WORK FOR KELOIDS,"AT LEAST IT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME OR MY GRANDSON. USED AS DIRECTED, IT HAD NO AFFECT AT ALL ON THE KELOIDS AFTER TWO BOTTLES."
1,Does not work,"This product absolutely failed to work for me. The item contains no ingredients list, and may be just plain rubbing alcohol. Buyer beware."
4,Appears to Be Working,"I've been applying this twice a day for nearly a month. Two areas on my leg had a small, red, bumpy scar the size of a pea. My doctor called them something specific. Something that forms from a cut that didn't heal properly. Whatever they are from, this seems to be fading and flattenning them out. Less noticeable and hopefully will fade even more with time. I would recommend."
