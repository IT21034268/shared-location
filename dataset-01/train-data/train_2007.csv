1,The DVD set arrived damaged.,"2 out of three CD's in th ebox set were damaged, so when we sat down to watch it tonight, we were very dissappointed."
1,Hmmmm.....,I have to say I didn't order this but will be going back and seeing if I was charged for this. I hear great things about it though.
5,Great series,After seeing season 1 we are hooked. The drama upstairs and down keeps your interest. The characters are easy to like or dislike and the story line is so interesting.
5,The best movie!,"If you are like me & love books, movies, & shows from this time. You will LOVE this show. And it's so good this season. I'm ready for season 3! ADDICTED!"
5,Thank you Amazon,"Our daughter who lives in London sent us a copy of this, but they use a different recording format in Europe and it would not work on our player. Amazon came through again! Now we watch the series on TV as the new ones come out."
5,Love Downton Abbey,"This show is so wonderful. I love to see the way things were done long ago, it keeps me guessing."
3,Much Better Than Season One,"I must confess that I found the first season of this series less than riveting. If it weren't for the costumes and settings--as well as the complex manners and mores of people who require other people to dress them and can't host a dinner party without multiple footmen, it would have put me to sleep. Just at the most dramatic moment, when the handsome Turk is about to deflower the eldest daughter, he drops dead! This left me feeling incredibly frustrated...But this season the War brings change, affecting the characters in surprising ways. New villains, including Bates' estranged wife and Mary's publisher fiance (Is he exactly a villain?) plot and counterplot and I find myself increasingly caught up in the story. I actually find myself looking forward to each new episode. While hardly great drama, this second series is a major improvement over Season One. It is actually quite good entertainment."
3,Downton Abbey Season 2 streaming,Love the show and it was great to be able to see the season at my own pace. My only problem is that we can only see it one time and then it expires. That bothers me. Suppose I want to see it again? I'm not paying again to see it. Or am I mistaken???
2,Who are you and what have you done with Downton Abbey?,"Season 2 of Downton Abbey is a huge disappointment! What started as a crisp and intricately woven drama has deteriorated into a clownish soap opera. None of the characters bear anything other than a superficial resemblance to their ""higher selves"" in season 1. What initially had me completely captivated, now makes me wince."
1,Disappointed,"Disc 2 didn't work and was totally blank. So I only saw disc 1. This was the second time I had ordered the Season 2 series and the second set that had a blank disc 2. Amazon was great and quickly sent me my replacement. Loved Amazon, but disappointed in the quality control of the company producing the discs."
3,BBC version of Dallas,"I watched Season 1 back to back when I was down with a bug and fell in love. Shortly after, Season 2 was available here. I was not happy with season 2 from the start but hoped that it would evolve to what I loved in season 1. It has not happened. The characters have all taken on less likeable characteristics except for the Dowager Dutchess :)! The story lines have become eerily soap opera-like: returns from the dead, everything that could go wrong going wrong... A predictable charge of murder awaits Bates. Matthew had a ""feeling""...no doubt he will walk again and also be able to ""complete a marriage"" although this may come and go with a lot of angst all over. A number of horrid things will come to light about Sir Richard and Lavinia. Seriously disappointing. There are wonderful and interesting stories of the time that could be told without all of the love triangle and return from the dead drama. I'll not buy another episode."
5,Downton Abbey,Wonderful series!!! Perfect cast of characters!!! Holds your interest & you cannot wait to see the next episode!!! Love it!!!
5,Great story,What a wonderful story. Could not wait to watch Season 3. Difficult to stop watching.. felt like a couch potato
5,Worthwhile for any fan,So many insights into the role of each of the main characters in the story. Even after viewing the series it is fun to consider how each character fit the role envisaged.
4,Very enjoyable show,"Well written with good characters. I didn't like this season as much as the last - the plot seemed to jump around a lot between episodes. Still had good stories, great costumes and scenery."
3,Better,"There are still some problems with the synchronization of the audio and visual, but all in all a big improvement to the second and third episodes!"
5,Hooked!,I am Hooked! This is a great series! I just happened to stumble upon this when everywhere I looked people were talking about it. I needed to know for myself what this Downton Abbey things was. I was greatly surprised that this show was exactly the type I love.Each episode makes me want more!
5,Upstairs/Downstairs Redux,"It is easy to form an addiction to this frothy soap opera of early 20th century English lives! The costumes and the set design are scrumptious. One could wish for a bit more of the history and politics (you'd better already know it, to have a real context) but ""The History Channel"" this is certainly not! However, the densely-plotted story lines - while admittedly overwritten - keep you hopping from one richly-drawn character to the next. Our favorite character is the dowager duchess played acerbically by Maggie Smith; she herself is worth the price of this set!It is wonderful to have the entire season in one package, with no commercials."
5,Downtown Abbey,Completely satisfied...product received was as advertised. The comments from the various reviewers were extremely helpful in chosing the right product.
5,Love this Show!,I was introduced to Downton Abbey through my Kindle Fire and my Amazon Prime membership! Watched the first two seasons on the Kindle within a day or two and got myself all caught up!
5,Great Historical Production,"I really enjoyed the twists and turns of Downton Abbey, Season 2. The production is very well done from the historical costumes to the set dressing; it feels very real. There's good character development, strong tension between characters and of course, the Dowager Countess (Maggie Smith) is fantastic--with the best lines of the show. I look forward to Season 3!"
5,Downton Abbey--the best series ever!,"I love the Downton Abbey Series. It is so beautiful! The costumes, the castle, the people--each character is played so well that you almost feel you know them. I wish there were an endless amt. of episodes to watch! I really love it and I'm part of the fan club. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a great story, great cast, beautiful costumes, and the beautiful castle! Fabulous!!"
5,Great Series- hope you Season 3 soon! Wonderful acting and costumes- the English know how to produce a show!,"Wonderful acting, costumes and great period period show- the English know how to produce a series. Hope you have season 3 on soon!"
5,Downton Abbey addicted,"After watching first season had to start watching season 2 right away, addicting story lines, well done. Love all the history..."
5,Masterpiece: Downton Abbey Original UK Version Season 2,"Season 2 of Downton Abbey is just as excellent as season 1. Superb acting, especially by Maggie Smith with other interesting characters and story lines. Compares very well with its predecessor, Upstairs, Downstairs."
5,Love this Series,"I love this series and have become addicted! I wish I could watch it every day! As with all of the Amazon streaming, it stutters and drops the connection."
3,"Love the show, but picture quality isn't great","This isn't a review of the content of Downton Abbey but of the quality of the download. Usually the picture is pretty good, but there are certain scenes where the picture quality is so bad and pixelated that you can't see what's supposed to be going on. I usually watch on my Kindle and even then it's blurry, so it would probably look terrible on a TV. While I haven't watched the HD version, I would recommend looking into buying it instead if you are planning to watch it on any larger sized screen."
5,Great show... great quality video,Love this show and the ability to stream old episodes seamlessly makes it really easy to catch up on past seasons!
5,Downton 2,This was a very enjoyable series to watch. I didn't think it would grab my attention but it did. Enjoy. Thank you.
5,Fantastic British Drama - acting superb!,"Loved the British acting along with elements of the ""classes"" in the British 1900's. How they interacted with each other, the interdependence they had and the historical evolvement of events was superbly accomplished. Have both Seasons 1 & 2, can't wait until the 3rd Season begins in January 2013."
3,Poor video quality,I loved Downton Abbey Season 2. I purchased the instant video but the quality was poor. I guess I am just accustomed to HD videos. Also the connection & load time was very slow.
5,Downton Abbey Season 2,"Even better than season 1. Set during the war and covering the influenza epidemic makes this series historical as well as fictional. That house is amazing and all the characters have grown so much. Yeah, Edith and Mary. You have both matured and mellowed. And Maggie Smith is one of the best characters. Loved the Christmas episode!"
2,Poor DVD quality,I love the story and will continue to watch it on PBS. The second DVD of this three piece set was so pixelated that we could not watch it. Big disappointment.
2,"Unclear info on ""features""","This has nothing to do with the fabulous Downton episodes, only poor marketing by Amazon. It was frustrating to try and find out if this season 2 UK edition really did have ""special features"" included. I looked through most of the comments and could not determine if it really did have any included along with the special Christmas episode. Of course Amazon description said that there were no special features. I was also frustrated with the price bouncing around from $26-$29 within an hour or less. As a result, I finally went to Target, found out it did have special features and got it for about $26."
2,love the movie but instant play not good.,i love this series but when playing instantly it kept stopping and i had to reload to be able to finish the episode. i know it is amazons connection because my netflix works perfectly fine.
2,Erroneous information,"Contrary to two reviewers' published comments, this version -- the UK version -- does NOT include the Christmas episode. Only the US version has this special episode. I am in the process of returning the UK version to the very cooperative and helpful seller. If the information had been correct this would be a 5 star review."
5,We need more seasons.,"Naturally this is fantastic. Maggie Smith alone is reason to watch any program. The rest of the ensemble cast sparkles. True to it's English origins it rivals Upstairs, Downstairs. You can see the depths of English theater in this."
5,I'm Addicted!,Downtown Abbey is my favorite show on TV. I can't wait to see Season 3. I have purchased both Seasons 1 and 2 from Amazon and watch them frequently. I never get tired of this program. I will purchase Season 3 as soon as it is available.
5,Great series!,Couldn't stop watching. Viewed whole series in 2 evenings. Superb in every way. I recommend this series to anyone interested in history and intriguing lives.
3,"Ok, only because I have not seen the whole season","Ok, only because I have not seen the whole season. First season was good; secondseason seems like it will be even better."
5,Outstanding Series,"The characters and the plots are fascinating, and like a good book you hate to see it end. We look forward to the next series in session three."
5,Downton Abby Season 2,"My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed this series. This is probably the best show we have seen in years. Great Story, Well Written, excellent acting."
5,Thoroughly enjoyed this!,I am a huge fan of Downton Abbey! So glad Amazon offers past seasons for people to view and enjoy!
5,Downton Abbey - Complete series 2,"Series 2 equals and even betters series 1 in many ways. If you're an avid fan of the show then I think you'll like the Blu-ray set. All the episodes, even ""The Christmas episode,"" are included in this set and appear in completion. It is a region free set so it plays in US Blu-ray players. The sound and picture quality are comparable to other Blu-ray movies and shows I own, and enhances the viewing of the show as the scenery is practically it's own character. This is a worthwhile buy for Downton fans eagerly awaiting the next series to begin airing in the US."
5,AWESOME!,"Downtown Abbey is television at it's very BEST. There is something for everyone in this series...drama, humor and even some action. The acting, costumes and settings are wonderful."
4,Great resource!,This was my first experience from ordering movies through Amazon. The process was EASY and convenient. I was able to download 8 episodes of my favorite TV show (Downton Abbey) onto my iPad so that I could watch them from the airport and my hotel room. A little planning on the early end made my trip more enjoyable. The only reason that I didn't give it a five star review is that I can't download onto my Mac Computer. That would only allow streaming. The download worked just fine though.
5,Downton Abbey Season 2,"We liked season 1, but found the twists and turns in season 2 to be even better. Worried it is headed in a dark direction and hopeful it is not."
4,"Beautiful series, but...","I love the actors, the settings are gorgeous, but I could do with a little less melodrama. Honestly, the writing is the only flaw I see with this series. Its so over the top sometimes, it comes off as a little campy. One catastrophe after another. People don't watch Masterpiece to get a soap opera fix. Just sayin'."
5,Love this show!,"So addicted to this show!Found it kind of late and can't stop watching...love the characters, the writing, the time period. It is wonderful!"
5,Downton Abbey season two is great,"This is a delightful series, with a great story line, wonderful characters and superb acting. I am totally engrossed in the lives of the Crawley family and their household!"
5,WONDERFUL!,"Was so glad to find the second season on Amazon Instant Video. An amazing show! Great characters, fantastic storylines, and wonderful costumes and scenery. Love Downton Abbey and highly recommend it to all viewers! Believe the hype!"
5,Good Show. Great Cast.,"I love this show. Its fun and amusing. It has its serious moments too, and you can really feel the emotions of the characters.Yes I would recommend this show to anyone who likes British TV shows."
5,Another great season!,The great story continues. Maggie Smith's one-lingers are hilarious. It's amazing how the writers are able to show everyday life and also incorporate historical events.
5,Great Entertainment,It doesn't get any better than this BBC drama series if you like turn of the century merry old England. Anything can happen even losing one or several main characters...no one is safe. I am addicted and anxiously waiting for Season 4!
5,Wonderful series . . .,"You won't be disappointed . . . unlike most serial dramas, this one is fast paced and although there is certainly a continuing thread throughout the series, most specific stories are resolved in individual episodes. Love it!"
5,Buy both series; sit back and enjoy!,A well-received gift for a special Downton fan! We are treating this series as the BEST in years. Would highly recommend a purchase even if you have seen it on PBS......amazing what you see and hear on the second and third watch.
5,Addicting!!!,I'd never heard of this until recently but I got this DVD for my wife for Christmas and she loved it. We watched it together and now she's got us watching the current TV show too. Good program and interesting plots.
5,Simply the best,"This series is simply the best programming I've ever watched on television. The writing is supberb, the characters - especially Maggie Smith! are perfect in their roles. You care about these people and their fate. The storyline segments are fast paced enough so you know you'll always get a chance to see your ""favorite"" character - yet long enough to sustain your interest.And it is a visual feast for the eyes. As a family we can't wait for each episode and dole them out like treats to keep it going as long as possible. The wait between seasons feels interminable."
5,season 2,as i watch this show it is easy to see why it is on MASTERPIECE THEATRE. PBS has always shown wonderful shows and this is one of the best.
3,Despite its shortcomings still worth watching,"Season 2 of Downton Abbey is nowhere near the quality of season 1. The writing is very predictable, but the worst part is that several of the characters personalities have been altered illogically. Good characters are supposed to grow and change from one season to the next, but the changes should make sense based on their experiences and circumstances. There were countless missed opportunities, overly dramatized situations (the relationship of Anna and Bates becomes extremely uninteresting), and been there done that saw it last week on another channel situations. Just bad writing altogether.Despite the shortcomings of season 2, I purchased it as soon as it was released and I watched with delight. Season three is already in production and I am concerned that like season 2, the speed at which season 3 was written and put into production indicated that the brilliance of season 1 will not return. However I will be watching."
5,Excellent Program!,"Downton Abbey is a very enjoyable series with wonderful characters, outstanding actors, and beautiful scenery. I loved every new episode and found that once I started watching, I didn't want to quit. The estate where it is filmed is so beautiful."
5,Downton Abbey Tip Top!!,The Downton Abbey Series is fabulous and I am so happy I was able to catch up on all the previous episodes so I'm in the know and caught up.
4,"Love the story, needs closed captions.","My wife and I really liked Downton Abbey and wonder that people actually lived that way from both the servants and the employers viewpoint. I watched what episodes were available on Netflix because Netflix has closed captioning and Amazon does not. Too bad because I think Amazon has some good content, but I do need the captions to be able to understand all the story. We are now watching Season 3 week to week after recording it on our DVR."
5,ten out of ten stars,"superbly written, directed and acted (so far...i'm in the second season)...i LOVE british period pieces and this is SO worthwhile. :D"
3,Quality of product,I love the series but the quality and ease of accessing is no where near Netflix quality for their Season 1 Downton Abbey.
5,Wonderful Series,I accidentally found Season 1 on my own and was well into Season 2 when it seemed the whole world was watching Downton Abbey. Beautifully done--even the scenery is eye candy. I believe Season 2 lives up to Season 1.
5,Downton Abbey Is Absolutely Addictive,"One of the best TV series ever produced. The entire cast including those whose characters have been discontinued are the best matches I have ever seen. The writing, direction, scene selections, editing, photography, costuming, and pacing are unmatched. I sincerely hope J. F. will be able to keep this ensemble together for at least one more season."
5,I'm Hooked,Just started watching the last 2 weeks & trying to get caught up to watch the 3rd season. Love this show.
5,Excellent,We love the series and were grateful to find it on DVD so we could watch it again and again.
5,Hooked,"What can I say - I'm hooked. The family wanted me to see the series but I held out thinking it was boring but WOW when I finally checked it out I was totally hooked. Sets and performances are supurb. Music, costuming fabulous. Can't wait for 3rd season."
5,Don't Miss This!,"Holy cow! This title may be misleading: I was tempted to skip this episode, thinking it just a puffed up Christmas ""special"", but to be frank, I'm so addicted to this series and its characters that I thought, ""Oh, what the hell."". Boy, am I glad I did! This is a big, important episode - perhaps the best of the season, with lots of not-to-be-missed turns for fans. I'm a late-comer to Downton, so I had to catch up on both seasons all at once, watching the original ""UK Version"" of Season 2 here on Amazon. I don't know how these episodes compare to what aired on PBS, but if this Episode 8 did not, do yourself a favor and watch it!"
5,Fantastic!,"Love this series! A beautiful and compelling story of family, love, and relationships that captured our hearts. My husband and I were so entranced by it, that we watched the whole series New Years Eve and New Years Day."
5,Masterpiece: Downton Abbey Original UK Version Season 2,"I watched season one with one of my daughters. I tried to buy season two so that we could watch it together also. Actually, when I purchased this season two,l I didn't realize that it would be a live stream on my computer. I watched every episode on computer, but my daughter wants to get the actual DVD to watch.I have LOVED this series. I love anything English or Irish, so this was right down my alley, so to speak. I love the characters, they do an excellent job, each and everyone of them. You know, either you love them or you love to hate them.I can hardly wait for season three."
2,Missing episode,I am upset because it didn't include the complete 2nd season. This DVD was missing the last episode-the Christmas episode which contained important elements to the story.
5,Love it!,Captivating look into the culture and social interactions of early 20th century Britain. Really enjoyed how the show pulls you in and you cant help but develop feelings toward the characters that shift with the story.
5,Great show,"Price was reasonable, couldn't find it anywhere else like Netflix. Love the program but never watched it before this year so I had to catch up two seasons before I could enjoy the third!"
5,Best Series Ever,Who needs reality TV when you have a program like this. Thoroughly enjoyed! Love the characters and the story line.
5,A fantastic trip across the pond.,"Downton Abbey transports you to the land of lords and ladies at a time when women were coming into their own, men were finding out that the world is quickly changing, not all for the better and life as it has been for generations is being turned upside down. The classes are mixing, the lines are blurring and you are caught in the wake of it all. It's a wild ride into the lives of one of the grand old houses, American influences and changing times."
5,Breath of Fresh Air,This show is so addictive. I am so tired of lousy sitcoms with lazy writing and terrible reality shows. This show is a new and fresh idea for my generation's television viewing and I enjoyed watching every minute of it.
4,Addictive television,"I have no idea what the attraction is to this show. I was never a soap opera buff and it is a rather sudsy production but I am thoroughly besotted with it. The character development (with a couple of exceptions) and the acting are extremely well done and it's wonderful to have access to the original UK version rather than the inexplicably edited US version. Thank you, Amazon.com."
1,wouldn't play - I'm returning it,wouldn't play.... I'm returning it. tried on two different players and it would not play. so disappointed with the christmas gift.
1,What a huge failure,"After a wonderful first season, the second season of Downton Abbey was a terrible disappointment. The story lines became more and more facile and unbelievable, the characters less and less interesting -- it absolutely generated into bad soap opera. After the first year's stellar quality, it was (or should have been) an embarrassment.I know others have already begun watching season three, but I have no intention of spending another moment -- wasting any more time -- on this series. Once a series loses its way in such a disappointing and ruinous way, I doubt that it will regain its footing. I suspect that is why the magnificent Dame Maggie Smith is leaving after this season -- I wouldn't want to be associated with it anymore, either."
1,Damaged upon delivery,"The show itself is great and we are enjoying the series, but unfortunately the DVD disks were damaged when they arrived, with significant skipping and tracking issues. Since we have already opened it, I'm not sure if we can return it. It is too bad - we were enjoying the show."
1,Downton Abbey Series 2,"Very disappointed overall.Bought one copy of 3 discs and was pleased with the first two discs except some episodes were out of sequence. The third disc would not play at all on my machine and came on my screen as only playable in Region A. Being in Australia that does not help.I returned the original 3 disc set and asked to have it replaced with a version that would work opn my machine explaining my problems with the original. The set was replaced and on trying to play the set again, found that this set of three discs was exactly the same. I have now asked for a refund. I will now wait till BBC produces a version that is compatible with Australia and purchase locally."
1,Uncut???,How can you tell this is the uncut UK version? I bought this after viewing the US version yet I can't tell any difference. Could someone point me to a specific scene not found in the US version so I know they sent the correct UK uncut version? Thanks.
1,PBS Blu-rays of Downton Abbey defectively mastered,"Both Seasons 1 and 2 of the PBS Blu-ray of Downton Abbey are defective. The release should be pulled. The UK release from Universal has no problems, and can be ordered via Amazon UK."
2,Just getting too silly,"Amnesia, long lost cousins, more cardboard villians...come on! Great series but it's become more soap of a telenovela with each episode."
2,"Downton Abbey, A House in History","Only ten minutes long, this is hardly worth it as an appetite whetter. I purchased the whole series elsewhere and the last disk had ""extras"" that were far more interesting."
4,Second Season as good as the first,"Loved it. A lot. The only reason I knocked a star off was because I think I will always love the first season of this show the most. My hope for this show is that it doesn't just become about the huge world events and how this family is affected. I predicted the new event/thing that crops up post war and thought it was rather arbitrarily used to ""fix"" a couple storylines...The Christmas Special was great, but it should really be called the New Year's Special considering Christmas ends in the first 3 minutes and everyone is talking about New Years. And I believe the events at the end happen at or just after the New year..."
5,Downton Abbey season2,Wonderful. Such a well done series. From the start it keeps your interest. One wants the show to continue forever.
5,Awesome series,All the actors are great and can't wait for Season 3 on Amazon Prime.The plot is very historically accurate too.
4,Great and believable until the last episode.,I would have given it 5 stars if Matthew hadn't died in the last episode. Just poor for the audience and the story.
5,loved it,One of my favorite shows. Reminds me of when I lived in the U.K. and would watch shows like this on Sunday evenings
5,Wonderful!,Love this show! I've just recently decided to watch this show after hearing several people talk about it. I am so glad that I did. I truly love this show and the characters! I'm addicted.
5,Great product!,It is wonderful. But I am not sure if find a difference between the blue ray and regular DVD. The DVD came quickly after ordering.
5,Donwton Abbey review,"This series has got to be one of the finest production in a long time. The story line, cast and atmosphere really bring in the viewer into their world. I highly reccomend."
3,typical english show,tea and crumpets. long winded and overfly dramatic. should have left them to their fate in wwii. not impressed by any character
5,Love this series.,Would recommend to anyone who likes to watch great acting and riveting story. Enjoy this series and share with friends
5,Downton Abbey - Continued Quality,"Having missed out on Downton Abbey when it first aired, we were very excited to see it on Amazon Prime. It is an excellent show and there is no sacrifice in quality going to season 2. It had a lot of hype. It did not disappoint."
5,Masterpiece Downton Abbey Original UK version Season 2,"I love the series. The acting is absolutely fabulous. Costumes are outstanding. Julian Fellowes mastering of the English language is remarkable. The series are very respectful of the period.. As far as the original UK version is concerned, I truly do not see any difference with the USA version."
5,Downton Abby Season 2,I saw a skit about this British show on Saturday Night Live. Was curious about it and watched the first episode on Netflix and got hooked on the series. We couldn't wait for Netflix to add Season 2 so were delighted to find the DVD available on Amazon. We got to catch up and now can't wait for season 3 to start on PBS in January.
5,Engaging,The series is very engaging. Like a good book you can not wait to view the next episode. I am anxiously wAiting for the next season.
5,Great show,My wife and I both enjoy watching this show. It combines a decent storyline and good acting. I recommend watching it.
5,Love this series!,Was very happy to get this season and I excited to get it before all the episodes aired on PBS. That is a nice incentive to preorder. Great period drama.
5,Thoroughly enjoyable,This series is simply amazing it shows how large of a distance there actually was between the aristocrat and the popper.
5,Great Series,"Downton Abby is a wondeful series. I intended to watch one episode a week,but once I started I couldn't stop and watched all episodes in two days. I can't wait for Season 3."
5,great television from the BBC on Amazon,"The BBC has done it again! This is a well cast, well written and well directed mini-series on a par with Brideshead Revisited. Well worth the time it takes to watch. We look forward to season 3."
5,Great series,"Great series for whole family. Watched with our 11 year old daughter, and she's hooked. Can't wait for 3rd season."
5,This is a wonderful series,"I've really enjoyed the excellent writing and acting in this historical drama. It's the best TV series I have seen in a long time, and I recommend it to everyone I know. Streaming on Amazon instant video has been an extremely convenient way to access the series."
5,I am obsessed!,This show is fantastic. The characters are all so interesting and I easily finished Season 2 in a few days. Not so patiently awaiting the 3rd season now. I am definitely a Downton Abbey addict!
5,Wonderful Blu-ray,"This second series of Downton Abbey is entertaining and beautifully produced. The Blu-ray addition is definitely worth the extra cost. The picture is crisp, clear, and beautifully detailed. The extras on the disc are entertaining and informative. I highly recommend this disc"
5,Outstanding Series,I love public television and this series is outstanding. Some say it is a soap opera but I find the characters and the time period very entertaining. Can't wait for season 4.
5,Love it.,loved the first season.Second is off to a great start.Can not wait to be able to sit down and watch this.
5,About as good as it gets,"Seldom do you see such a most enjoyable entertainment experience. Just imagine, no cursing (I'm far from a prude), no raw sex (see prude), no computer generated effects (hooray). So well done, from performances to directing, etc., it's great to see that this type of thing can still be out there. A dozen thumbs up!!"
5,Complicated Love,"A family that has conflict, respect and love that is ridget , painful and misunderstood. I would love yo live like that for a week!"
5,GREAT SHOW,I NEEDED TO WATCH A COUPLE OF EPISODES THAT DIDN'T TAPE SO I DOWNLOADED THIS ON MY KINDLE HD. WITHOUT HEADPHONES THE AUDIO WAS A BIT LOW SO I USED HEADPHONES WITH GREAT IMPROVEMENT. THE VIDEO QUALITY IS GREAT.
4,if you like history and drama this is it,good story with lots of historical details -- story is somewhat predictable but is still entertaining -- acting is great and set detail is interesting
5,Downton Abbey,Love it!! Fantastic show Great show can't wait for the next season to begin. Season ending leaves you wanting more
3,British class system,"I used to live in England, so I was interested to see this series. Many of the situations are so true to life, and seem so ridiculous to Americans. Yes, being a butler is a silly job for a grown man. Servants are expected to remember their station. Many things happen behind the scenes that make life interesting. It is a soap for the upper class. but I DO wish they would leave out the passionate homosexual kissing. It ruins an otherwise pleasant soap."
5,Pleasant viewing,Totally hooked! Interesting to see how some folks live. Two stories intertwine so easily. The servants have their own drama along side the family who lives in Downton Abbey.
5,Awesome show,"would absolutely recommend this show for family viewing, very interesting period in historyWe watch this show at work on our lunch hour! It makes our day!"
5,Downton Abbey,series recommended by coworker. Found inside working of a big estate interesting and the personalities diverse. Was able to get up to speed on this years episodes. Have recommended to others.
5,loved,This is a great series. I got totally involved with the first episode and had to watch all available episodes. Can't wait for the new season.
5,Kept hearing about it from my sisters....,"Really enjoy this show, and so glad I could watch for free with my Amazon Prime membership! I am all caught up with my sisters!"
5,Great Series,Watched it over a couple of days with the wife. It just sucks you right in. Can't wait to watch season 3.
4,One of the best shows on TV,This show is very good at juggling multiple storylines and keeping them all interesting. Its an interesting look at england before WWII
5,Addictive,"In this season you truly become invested in the characters. They will continue to surprise you though, and it is so much fun to anticipate what will happen next. Enjoy!"
5,love the show,i love this show if you haven't watched it try it. watched the first season on netflix and had to order season 2 right away.
5,downton Abbey,"Very entertaining , keeps you engaged. We hate when the hour show its over. .. keep it coming, love each and every character"
5,awesome,It is a british gone with the wind and I love it. It is more in depth and shows more of the commoners side.
5,Downton Abbey,My favorite DVD collection this year. I don't know if I can wait until next Spring for the next series. I share this collection with all my friends - both Series I and Series II. Tremendous acting and so informative historically. No one would be disappointed. You are just left yearning for more from this family and their large staff at the Manor/Mansion.
5,Great!,"I love period shows, so this is perfect. Streaming quality is good, I don't have any problems watching it online."
5,Slow DSL,Streaming has hung up a few times but I think it is my DSL line speed.Would love it if I could get a faster speed.
2,"Great content, poor streaming","I love this show and started watching it on Amazon Prime since Netflix doesn't carry season 2. Unfortunately, the streaming stalled 4 separate times during the show and I had to refresh my browser each time to reset it. It was extremely disappointing and disruptive. I'm thinking twice about keeping my Amazon Prime subscription going..."
5,Very well done,"The characters were developed in a way that allows you to really relate to them, I couldn't stop watching once I started."
5,More than a soap opera,"There are so many characters one can surely find a favorite to either love or hate. Very well acted. Both the servants and thethe aristocracy have complicated relationships within their circles, and some surprising relationships across the social divide. All very believable and set in a very interesting period in time"
5,Great series,I truly enjoyed the first season of Downton Abbey and season 2 is just as enjoyable.Love how the characters interact with each other.Highly recommend.
5,"Downton Abby, Season 2","Wonderful story line and acting. Movie worth viewing and owning....just ask the rest of the world, being sold in 28 different countries."
2,Great show,Great show however this copy of the DVD is a little inferior. It continually pauses and often causes the television to turn off! Not sure that this is an official dvd!
4,Downton Abbey Season 1 & 2,"My wife and I both enjoyed the history including the period represented with clothing, attitudes about position and wealth, the breaking independence that seems to take place in every generation. We are looking forward to season 3, hoping this is never ending. Life centered around war is such an interesting topic....great stories. We loved the pace and the acting... we got lost in the characters, which is a good thing!"
4,Fully functional,The DVD in question was purchased as a gift and I have not seen it but rhe receiver of the item was very happy.
5,Exciting Start to Season 2!,"Downton Abbey is just marvelous! Beyond the stuffy English attitudes, posh and spoilt lives of the Abbey's inhabitants and petty servant politics, there is so much that the show offers - geo-political ongoings of that era, stunning architecture, societal constructs, culture to name a few."
5,Loved Season 2!,"We loved Season 2. It was a huge improvement over the uncomfortable, ""questionable"" scenes in some of Season 1. I think this is a great series & I hope they don't ruin the future episodes it by interjecting more ""adult"" themes into their script. It's great the way it is....let's hope it stays that way!"
2,Shockingly Bad,"What an utter waste after a satisfying season 1. Season 2 devolves into a bad soap opera with repetitive, nonsensical, underdeveloped plots. I don't think I've ever had such a drastic change in opinion of a show. If you want a good historical drama with complex, compelling, and relevant themes rather than simple soap opera drama watch Deadwood."
4,Buffering at just the not right moments!,Clear quality. Quick and easy purchase. Unfortunately the buffering happened more often than liked and when watched on the iPad the app crashed a few times.
3,"Great Story, Horrible DVD","I purchased both seasons 1 & 2 in March 2012. Just now, in September, I got around to watching. Good thing I'd already seen the PBS airings because 1 DVD in each set was unwatchable: picture in pixels and no sound. I suppose it's too late to return them. My review has nothing to do with the quality of the programs, I love them; but with the quality of the DVDs. If you make a purchase, check them asap to ensure you have what you paid for."
2,From Great to Hate. Fire the Writers!,"Season two is a huge disappointment. I just watched Season 1 episode 1 again, and I admit I am bewildered wondering what happened? What were the writers thinking? What audience did they produce Season 2 for? Downton Abbey Season 1 began as an intelligent, cerebral show and it has become an insipid, silly soap opera with ridiculous plots. For shame. Such amazing acting talent wasted on such stupid scripts."
2,Very disappointing after Season 1,"I was very excited to watch Season 2 of Downton Abbey after such a great Season 1. Unfortunately, the great writing of the first season was not carried on. By episode 3 of season 2, Downton Abbey completely falls apart as a series. The plot lines and character behavior become improbable, erratic, nonsensical and incredible. It's a shame because the show had such great potential."
2,"Great series, but no subtitles","Downton Abbey is a great series, but the version supplied by Amazon was useless to me asit did not provide for subtitles. I am hard of hearing and require subtitles for assistance, especially with the English accents."
2,Great Season - Difficult Connection,I very much enjoyed this season of Downton Abbey. My low rating has to do with the difficulty in connection and control of this purchase. I interfaced with the Amazon site both directly with my PC and indirectly with my Roku box and both options proved incredibly difficlut. The Roku box lost total control of the movie play features and the PC lost partial control. This is not an issue when connecting with other movie providing sites. Either their instructions for how to make this work are insufficient or the response from the Amazon site is poor.
5,So good!!,This made a wonderful gift for my parents. We all love Downton Abbey and its great to re-watch episodes whenever you want!
2,Season 2 character development was dissapointing,"I do not watch TV but caught season 1 on Amazon on a whim and was drawn in by the characters. I was surprised that I cared about how the character fared, in part because the development was believable and there were some characters that had a sense of honor that was refreshing and worth rooting for.2nd season was a disappointment. The character development was not believable as some of the characters acted quite inconsistently with who they were in the first season without adequate explanation. The first season was more subtle and gentle/kind but the second season had jarring events and behavior thrown in just to get a reaction. The subtle depth and rhythm of the first season was rend apart by the 'cheap shots' taken in the script. It did not feel authentic.Quite dissapointed and won't bother with season 3."
5,Downton Season 2,Loved it. Continuing the triumphs and failures...it reminds me of a serialized Legends of the Fall. I'm looking forward to the third season.
4,oboy,good cast very entertaining great shots of england great story line enjoyed every moment hope that they make more asap
5,"Rich, intriguing television","I'm a late-comer to the Downton Abbey series. But I was immediately hooked after watching the first episode of Season 1 on my new roku box. After gobbling up the whole first season within a week, a friend bought me this, Season 2, which I sat glued to through within the next week. Set in the pre-World War 1 era of Britain, the series drew me in with its authentic depiction of life among both the wealthy and the servant class. Compelling stories emerge from the lives and relationships of all of the characters as the war approaches and changes everything. I highly recommend this intelligent series."
5,Amazing!,"I really can't overstate how much I love this show. I pretty much abandoned everything else happening in my life for a few days to watch the entire series. The characters are very endearing, and their relationships are dynamic and interesting. I also like how the show captures various political and historical events of the period.The streaming from Amazon worked flawlessly, even with HD!"
1,Why Bother???,I watched season one for no charge with Prime. But buy season two when Amazon does not support my iPod or iPad and other guys HD offering that does works on iOS is 20% less expensive.
1,Good for a laugh,"The music, house and clothes are beautiful. All very well done.But the acting and storylines are cartoonish! I found myselflaughing out loud at the miracle recovery, the bufoonish doctor, the servantstalking back!! It's like a cliff notes version of a harlequin romance.I recommend the old Upstairs Downstairs. Never lived like the filthy rich parasites but the relationship between the two classes makes more sense.Much better acting, fully developed characters and storylines.It looks dated but still excellent."
3,"Good, BUT...","We caught the 2nd season on television and became instantly addicted so we decided to purchase the first season. We love the setting, characters, etc. but were disturbed that in the very first episode was a homosexual scene. We were shocked because from the 2nd season you would never know about the specific character, Thomas, is homosexual. This was a turn off for us."
1,Fine if you like to watch men kissing men,"The story was interesting and engaging, but I stopped watching when they portrayed a man kissing another man romantically. Not my cup of tea. If you like that sort of thing, this will likely be a good choice for you. If you don't like that sort of thing, be prepared for a surprise ""yuck"" factor.NOTE: This was accidentally posted on the Season 2 review. I have reposted this under Season 1 where it belongs. I am leaving the accidental Season 2 review in place because of all the dialogue it generated."
5,Wonderful!,"This series is completely engaging and as informative as it is entertaining. The story captured us and the characters enticed us through the strength of the actors portraying them. It is just a wonderful experience. Be sure to watch the first season before this season. While this season can stand on its own, the first season really develops the story and chapters."
5,Even better than you could imagine.,"My wife has been asking me to see this Masterpiece Production for quite some time. I finally gave in a week ago and I have to say I'm hooked! Great storyline, superb acting and top notch directing. You won't be disappointed, I promise."
5,Excellent purchase,Enjoyed every moment of this series. Delievery to me was excellent and had no problems in viewing this series. Wish there was more of it.
5,great drama,i recommend this to all adults. as each episode ends you can't wait for the next one to begin. kudos
4,Review of Season 2,"We liked Season 2. Fascinating insight into the class system of the time and how the servants could be more snobby and bigoted than the ""upstairs"" family."
5,Outstanding Entertainment,"Outstanding Acting, Writing, Setting, and Production. I hope they continue this drama forever. Just think, the 20's, 30's, and 40's at Downton Abbey!"
5,From a Newly Converted Angophile,"As a Prime member, I watched Season 1 for free after hearing good reviews of it. It was well-cast, well-acted, with beautifully detailed costuming and a compelling story line. So compelling, I purchased the second season for $14.99, and was not disappointed. The drama and intrigue continued, as well as excellent character development. Titled or servant, the author is able to show us that everyone has lapse of judgement, inner struggle and even the ability to change. The villains softer sides are exposed, and the mercurial emotions of the three daughters seem to evolve and mature over time so that their better traits of forgiveness, selflessness and charity are shown. I was very pleased with my purchase, and look forward with great anticipation, for Season 3."
5,Great series,I am recommending this series to all my friends. The story is timeless. Masterpiece did an excellent job with the production.
5,The writing for the show is superb!,"Love Maggie Smith's sarcasm as Cousin Violet. She's a hoot. Storyline keeps you watching. Enjoy watching, but not living, this time gone by."
5,A window into the British Society during WWI.,"This riveting English Novel is screened in best traditions of British cinematography. It presents excellent cast and scenery, a great family entertainment."
5,Classic!,"My favorite series from any production company in any era. I highly recommend Downton Abbey. It begins with a terrific series of scripts from outstanding writer(s), brilliant acting and sumptuous sets. Top it off with a score that fits perfectly and you have a must-see production from PBS."
5,very good. Season three?,"Season three? anyone? We need to know about Mr, Bates!I love brittish TV Drama! Wonderful Acting and well written."
5,Addicted,By the 3rd episode of season 1 I was hooked. So glad to be able to watch season 2 right away for free with my Amazon Prime account. Now I'm on to season 3 which is still free for another week on PBS.org.
5,Love this show!!!,I watched season 1 this past summer and was hooked. Glad to see it's available on Amazon Prime! Love it!
5,Just gotta love those Brits,We got hooked on this series while visiting some friends. We sat for 6 hours watching seasons one and two. When we got home I bought season 1 & 2 so I could watch again. I've already pre-purchased season 3.
4,Clever,Downton Abbey's second season is not quite as great as the first but it's still good. Some problems were too easily resolved.
5,Truly engrossing,"This is the best show I have seen in awhile. The actors, storyline, scenery, etc are all completely amazing! I was expecting a dull British drama, but boy was I wrong. Never a dull moment at Downton Abbey!! I am eager for season 3!"
5,Love this!,"If you like historic/period shows, you will love this! Each time I watch an episode, I want to know what comes next---immediately!!"
5,Fantastic,"Once I started the season, I couldn't stop watching! I am hooked and can hardly wait for season 3 to begin."
5,Downtown Abbey 2,I love this series. I had been waiting for this second chapter to come out for quite a while. I got to view and enjoy the whole 2nd series before it aired on Masterpiece Theater. It was also shipped well protected and arrived quickly.
5,Downton Abbey season 2,"Really enjoy this series. Get a bit frustrated at times with the characters and all their self-inflicted troubles, but I guess that's what moves the story on. Look forward to season three."
5,More good stuff at Downton,The story just keeps getting better and better. The characters and those playing them are perfect. And I absolutely adore Maggie Smith as Violet!!
5,outstanding,"Excellent story.well done with good insight into history, entertaining humor and drama.I thoroughly enjoyed viewing this program.can't wait for next season..."
5,intriguing story,"It is hard to find a good story, excellent acting & production without a lot of glitz. This is it"
5,Fabulous,So well written. A great show for all. Finally something of interest. I highly recommend. Warning......addictive! You can't wait to see the next episode.
5,fantastic,"Really enjoyed this show, especially in HD. Waiting for season three to become a free instant video option.Soon I hope!!!!!"
5,Excellent,Love the 2nd season as well as the 1st. I like the way it ended kind of wrapping everything up.
5,Amazing...,"This is just getting better! Be prepared to laugh, to cry, to hate and to love! Such a wonderful show!"
5,Great series!!,I fell in love with Downton Abbey when I first found season 1 on Netflix. I try and catch each episode but sometimes work does not permit it so decided to get the DVDs so that I can watch when I like and as many times as I like. This series keeps you riveted - never a dull moment.
5,A not-so-guilty pleasure!,"Great characters, setting, costumes and story line. Such a fresh change from the usual monotony on TV every night. Can't wait to see the next episode. Very addictive indeed!!"
4,Another great British series!,"I would have given this series a 5. but it does drag a little in places.I think the actors are well suited for the roles they play. I actually hate Thomas, and am not very fond of O'Brien and the new maid.The scenery is spectacular. The photography is extremely well done. The costumes are authentic as far as I can tell. The writers weave the different concurrent stories together flawlessly, and keep coming up with surprise twists that I could not see coming. The director and crew turn the series into a first class production."
5,Season 2 Adequately Touches on Realities of WW1 on all society levels..,"I was impressed with the sensitive and insightful way the author of these episodes touches on the details of how the war touched each socioeconomic group - especially the way it gave way to equality (albeit temporary). As well, the reality is that these young men in war were heroes -- but that never meant to imply they weren't terrified. Well scripted, brilliantly acted. You cannot skip Season 2 and fully understand Season 3."
2,downton idiocy,"this series at its best is not as good as everyone makes it out to be...""oh no the pudding isnt ready""...but all the characters are different in season two and you dont really know why...when all these things happen to Bates, for example, i feel like Anna is a fool, not a woman in love...Bates cant be forgiven over and over again, he just seems like a loser. why is she so sure that he is such an amazing man when so much goes wrong around him...why did they drop the plot about patrick...you start to feel like, ""how can no one realize what is going on here...why doesnt anyone say anything when they are supposed to..."" its contrived and synthetic...if anyone opened their mouths and told someone else what was going on...this season would be 20 minutes long. robert and his wife were so devoted and now she is mean and he is upset he has to eat lunch alone...oh no the cake isnt good!!!! its a disaster. watch Spooks instead."
5,Super,"I highly recommend season 2 of Downton Abbey. Although a soap opera, it is very entertaining and beautifully acted with outstanding costumes and furniture."
1,I still haven't got it!,"I guess with the Christmas rush there is still a chance that it will arrive, but my hopes are dwindling."
1,Downton Abbey Series 2,The third disc cannot be played in Australia. Amazon took no action to remedy this situation regardless of my complaints - simply sent me another unusable product!. This product was so bad I have now opted to exercise my purchasing through a US website rather than Amazon.
1,Downton Abbey Audio ENcoding Flawed,"The video for this product is excellent. However the audio encoding is quite flawed. I have an Oppo BDP-93SE Blu-ray player with the latest upgrades. To get the best sound and keep up with audio encoding format enhancements I use the player's processor with upgraded software, high grade DACs and clock to decode the audio and send it directly to the Denon Video Receiver. However, there is some flaw in the audio encoding that results in no center channel output and very little subwoofer output. I also have a Sony player that produces the same output problem. No other blu-ray I possess (over 80 of them) has this problem and they all play perfectly in the Oppo. I can only assume that the PBS conversion of the English version was done sloppily."
1,Waste of money,Not what I had expected. Thought that I was getting Episode 1 od Season 2 of Downton Abbey. 1.Thankfully I got it for free!!
1,Computer version vs DVD,I did NOT want to watch this series that I absolutely love on my computer. I wanted to buy the series as a DVD but fell misguided in the way I was led to purchase the computer version. Isn't there a way to help customers figure this out?
5,great series,"Brilliant actor play. Everything is simple and complicated as life is... No good and bad guys, just life. Higly recommend.."
5,obsessed,With pleasure I watched hours on end of all 3 seasons and the only negative is that it is over ....i will miss downtown terribly :(
1,my wife loved it,I spent a little while trying to figure out what was going on. And I came to the conclusion I didn't really care that much. This was actually a purchase for my wife and she seems to like it a lot and that's important. Also the plot line centered a giant space ship called Abby. I'm not into syfi. But if I was I would love this.
1,I was not able to play the DVD. This is the wrong region settings for the USA. Very disappointed.,"I was not able to play the DVD. This DVD is the wrong region settings for the USA, making it impossible to play on the average Blue ray DVD player. Very disappointed."
1,Couldn't make it work where I wanted it.,"I bought this so I could put it on google using my television. They've made it so convoluted, if I get around to -I'll tell you what I think."
3,Audio Issues,Ordered this DVD and had to exchange it because of audio issues. The replacement had the same audio problems. Amazon should recall this lot of DVDs.
2,A sad Flop,"The delightful British time piece (full of witty dialogue) of season 1, sadly deteriorates to a shallow American soap opera in season 2. I doubt whether it can be saved @ all in season 3. But let's pray they muster some brilliant brains & manages the impossible."
3,Not up to par,I watched the second season of Downton Abbey with great anticipation. I had viewed the program on my HD television and it was a memorable experience so when I received my copy I popped the disc into my Blu-Ray player I was disappointed because the crispness and wonderful details were sadly missed. So I hope it was just my copy but I am down hearted and am thinking of contacting Amazon about the sheer blandness of my copy of Downton Abbey!Downton Abbey: Season 2 (Original U.K. Edition) [Blu-ray]
5,Quality programming!,"Wonderful show, enjoyed every minute of it. Incredibly well done. The cast is magnificent, and the attention to detail is outstanding. Why can't American stations give us something this good?"
5,classic british aristocrats,Downton Abbey is a classic work of fiction that is well presented but blends modern day American English with classic British Aristocrats style. I like the way Julian Fellowes writes and brings all classes together in this fascinating tale.
5,Gripping,Historical detail with an intriguing plot. Watched season 1 and season 2 back to back in two weekends.Can't wait for season 3.
5,Another Masterpiece,"You wouldn't think that an early an early 20th century, ""soap"" about a wealthy English family and their servants would draw you in, but it does. It is well written and produced. The show is balanced between the lives of the privileged class and the dignified lives of the servants. Most of all you end up caring about the characters and become invested in their plight."
5,Downton Abbey,"Love It!!!!! So glad it was offered with my Prime Membership. Almost don't want the season to end. Characters are great, storyline is great . . ."
5,Addicted!,I absolutely love Downton Abbey and cannot wait for season 3 & 4 to be available on Amazon Prime!! I recommend it to everyone!
5,Simply Addicting!,"This show is amazing, full of characters that you quickly get to know and grow to love or hate! The ups & downs are reel feelings felt by most viewers. There are plenty of laughs, joys, tears and sorrows to keep it evenly rounded."
5,Love.Love.Love,I absolutely love Downton Abbey. It has drawn me in and keeps me anticipating the next episode. The mix of characters' personalities and the contrast between the servants and their masters is quite intriguing.
5,Downton Addict,I bought the UK version for season 2 for the same reason as I did for season 1. It had more scenes and I want as much of it as I can get.
5,love downton abbey,Can't wait for next season in January!!! Want to know what happens with Matthew and Mary! And also with Mr. Bates and Anna
5,i loved it,I thought it was spell binding one of the best series i have every seen. i love the interaction between characters
5,Best show out there,"Typically not a fan of English TV but between this and Sherlock, WOW!Give it a go, it is well worth the time spent."
5,The Best Mini Series I have seen to Date,I so enjoy the Dowtin abbey series that I could watch it over and over. It was a good tv watching experience
2,improve your score,The book seems to be geared more to the single digit handicapper rather than a high handicapper. I find the book dated and the author to be patting himself on the back too often.
5,Required Reading,"This book & Bob Rotella's ""Golf Is Not a Game of Perfect"" should be required reading for anyone serious about improving their game. His ideas on strategy, how to handle bad shots, & how to prepare yourself mentally are extremely helpful. This book has helped me improve more than any instructional book or lesson ever did. This is not an ""instructional"" book filled w/pics...this is a glimpse into the mind of a scorer. Highly recommended."
3,Good but a bit dated,"A bit dated, so nothing new here, but a fine book for a new or hoping-to-improve golfer. A good place to start..."
5,Good Stuff,"Course Management - master it, and you become one a scoring machne; this book shows you the way."
1,The Tail is too short!,What's the point. I purchase this to go on a cruise because my 20month LOVES to run away. But the tail part is WAY too short! What's difference I can just hold his hands. I'm returning it-it's pointless (but cute).Gold Bug: 2-in-1 Harness Buddy - Lamb
4,A good thriller,"Tooth and Nail starts by bringing Det. Rebus south to London and having him assist with investigation of gruesome murders that seem to have few clues. His experience and keen sense quickly help get him engaged and solve the case. There is some romance involved that seems contrived. There is an interesting undercurrent of strained relations between Scots and Londoners. The resolution is unexpected but satisfying. While a bit too bloody for my taste, a good thriller overall."
4,Rebus in London,"This novel, in a way, could have been about any detective as it feels like Rebus and the series hasn't really hit its stride yet. The character and Rankin's writing come a long way over the years. Ultimately, this is a good mystery/crime novel that clips along at a fair pace and it features an odd yet interesting antagonist in the form of the Wolfman."
2,Martial arts fantasy wire-fu,"If you're into the sort of craziness that is martial arts fantasy wire-fu and magic, you might like this movie. Most people will find it absurd. How Chinese people can consider this entertainment is beyond me.Don't get me wrong. I love martial arts movies. I've collected them for years. I can stand some cheese here and there, but this one takes the cake. Wire-fu, magic relics, super-human and magical moves, instant cures... the list runs the gamot of the typical martial arts fantasy movie gone wrong.Some of the special effects are pretty cool and the martial artists are good, but the muck of the rest of it pretty much makes this a laughable experience.Rent before you buy."
4,Nice,These headphones are pretty nice. The sound quality in the headphones are very good. Like other headphones these want go dead.
3,Eyepiece Cover,"The quality of the eyepiece is fine, the description on the other hand is ridiculous. Picture shows a ""round"" eyepiece when in fact the actual product is rectangular. The size description listed is the size of the package, NOT the size of the eyepiece cover."
3,Very mixed bag,"Superb Nurse, good Empress, lousy Emperor, Barak, Dyer's Wife and Falcon. Superb conducting and sound. Yikes, what a mess -- buyer beware."
1,Work -At-Home Directory full of scams,"I ordered this book hoping for legitimate work ideas. I mailed in for information from 15 companies listed in the directory. Every one of them sent me an unprofessional brochure filled with typos, misspellings, and printing errors and each requested money ($30-$60) in order to get more information. Many were extremely vague about what it was I would receive for this money. A few said the money would get me information on how to find companies that need people to work at home! Isn't that what this directory was supposed to do? This book is a waste of money and utilizing it is a waste of time, stamps and SASE envelopes."
3,Not much to lose...,"Because there are so many of these offers on the Internet for mega bucks, I decided to go with something simple at first. I figured that way even if it didn't work out, I wouldn't waste much money. There is a nice variety of opportunities here, and I've received responses from the ones that I've researched further. If you're really interested in supplementing your income in your free time, I'd say go for it! They are right in saying that there are a lot of scams out there that will cost you big bucks. For this book there is little money up front and lots of great listings inside."
1,reader-,I would not waste my time with this book. The author provides you with some home based opportunities but you could find these offers in the back of any magazine. At the beginning of the book it states they have researched the companies but then they go on the say that some offers my not be current or legitimate.
5,Titles Not Listed,"Purchased this set and Best of Lucy & Friends [4 dvd] at the same time. Upon receipt I discovered the shows in this 2 dvd set are included in the Lucy & Friends set. I thought I was getting complettely different shows.The show titles are Not listed in the description, if they were I would have purchased just Best of Lucy & Friends."
5,Tack Sharp and better than the OEM,"This lens, for most of your general photo ops, is THE lens to have on your camera body. It is as quick to focus as an OEM lens, tack sharp and 1/2 the price.Tamron has removed this lens from its line of lens and I can't figure out why.If you need a lens for generL shooting and can find one of these - grab it !!!"
3,"Good lens, not great on Alpha 100","I use this lens with an Sony Alpha 100. For most of the range it works well. When zoomed out all the way, it vignettes considerably (curved shadows on the corners). The auto-focus works well, but it tends to overexpose slightly."
2,It does what it is supposed to do but you have to go through a lot of hoops,Its not a simple plug and play cable. I purchased it to transfer files between my laptops (all Windows 7) and i found that it was not straightforward to use this cable to transfer the files. I had to do a lot of research and go through a lot of hoops. I think it would have been easier if i would have purchased Microsoft easy transfer cable.
1,Incomplete Information,"I might be interested in buying this item, but since I can't find out what movies are on it anywhere on Amazon or any other source, I couldn't be less interested."
5,Hit me HARD!,"I got this figure with the Jo from Burst Angel set... I was looking for the best figure of this nice Girl... Rukia I could not find the best figure until I got this one... Nice Painting, the Kon figure makes it worth it... so if you want to get some money on figures and are a Fan of Bleach, get this figure! its REALLY GOOD! Worth the money!"
3,a fact-filled disappointment,"This is a useful book. It is very well researched, extraordinarily documented and tells you essentially anything you need to know about the CIA's plot to overthrow the Arbenz government in Guatemala. Unfortunately, the writing is so turgid and dull it's difficult not to nod off in the middle of a particularly gritty section of history. I applaud Immerman's effort and the completeness of his overall work, but he really should have taken on a jounrnalist to help him get through the rough spots and make the book actually readable."
4,"Factual, balanced account","This is a good, factual balanced account which brings to bear all the relevant facts and leaves out any ideological bias. It's also very well written and makes for an easy read."
5,An Invaluable Resource,"This encyclopedia is an invaluable resource for any Magic player. No matter how many cards you have or how many times you've played the game, chances are you haven't seen every card. That's where this book comes in. Even dealers I spoke with said they learned about a few cards from this book."
5,This book does an excellent job of cataloging cards.,I purchased this book in my second year of playing Magic the Gathering and it has been a great resource to me. Not only does it show every card in print up to a point but it has a great deckbuilders index. Even when im not using it as a resource it is very fun to look through. An excellent purchase.
4,The Ultimate Guide for the _High-level_ Player,"This book has pictures of every card up to Alliances, and with its sequel is the ultimate guide to Magic. Always having the exact orginaltext at hand is cool, and it lets you look atentire sets at once. It's great for persual andfinding what's rare and what's uncommon.However... the book's missing everything afterAlliances, much of the errata has been changed,sometimes because the Encyclopedia was blantantlywrong, and the indexs can't even compare to acomputer based database, of which there is several on the Internet for free.Unless you are in the several thousand card range dedicated player like I am, this book is probably not the best buy. On the other hand, the dedicated Magic player can find this book very enjoyable."
5,A great used buy.....,"I first saw Brian play live at Garden of Eden in Hollywood, CA. WOW..did I pick a good week to visit southern CA. At his live show, I bought his 2 most recent releases. Since that concert, I have been looking for other Hughes projects. I think this CD is best described as Brian Hughes blend of so many legendary guitarists but with his unique voice. I am happy to have picked this one up and I suspect if you appreciate great guitar jazz (with a little latin influence), you will be pleased."
5,Here's an excellent reference book for those interested in teeth!,"As a pre-dental student, I found that reading and reviewing this book was very beneficial to me. It clearly explained essential terminology and anatomical structures of each tooth in the human jaw. From this, one could understand almost every intricacy included in this book. Such fascinating information ranged from tooth and crown morphology to trait relationships and geographic variation. It also provided great background information on the inception of this valuable discipline, illustrating the research conducted by many individuals around the world along with important dates and facts. The other point I'd like to make about this book is that it identifies many new facets of research that has not yet been started, but could provide a sundry of new knowledge and practical application."
5,Imatin floppy cleaning kit,"Of all the ones I have used this has always worked on the first try.It does not go into dos which is annoying and wastes time. I have found Imatation products to be of consistantly high quality. On the very rare occations when I have had a problem whith one of their floppies they not only replaced the flawed disk without complaint, the gave me a few extras."
4,Helpful Video,This video was extremely helpful to understanding the Total Immersion swimming method. I have made much progress since I started!
5,Good book but Triathlon Swimming made easy is better,"This was my first TI book and it was really eye openning. However, my second read was better, ""Triathlon Swimming Made Easy"" . I just wish I had learned the TI technique before I swam the 2.4 miles in the Louisville Ironman. I am swimming so much better, I enthusically endorse the TI technique to triathloners of every experiece level. We all can improve our swimming."
4,it works,"I got into swimming when some goals I had in the military changed and I needed to increase my swimming speed and distance. I took classes at the local city pool, watched various ""experts"" on youtube, all to no avail. This book explained swimming efficiency so well, that without even finishing it or using its drills- simply implementing it's theory, I went from being winded after 50 yards to completing 1500 yard swims in about two weeks- as the cardio ability is already there, the form needs to be fixed."
1,Go to youtube instead.,"I rate items based on three criteria - Does it work as advertised? Does the value justify the cost? Does it improve my life? I put my recommendation at the top, then answer those three questions below.RECOMMENDATIONI do not recommend this product. I'm an open water swimmer and triathlete, though I mostly train in indoor pools. I love the total immersion technique, and Laughlin has serious open water credibility, but the DVD fell far short of the quality I found on the shorter, denser clips on YouTube of Laughlin's onsite coaching sessions.FUNCTIONALITYThe instruction offered on this DVD is almost nonexistent. You're far better off searching youtube for some of the videos on actual technique and drills.VALUEThis product is not at all worth your money.DOES IT IMPROVE MY LIFE?No. To the contrary, it made me angry."
4,Amazing Results w/ a Caveat!,"I purchased this dvd after being fed up with relying on pull buoys, flippers, and wetsuit pants. I've done over 18 triathlons, including 2- 1/2 ironmans but was not happy with my swim efforts. Started doing the drills from the dvd, but felt I needed feedback on what I was doing. Attended a TI workshop near my home, and after 2 days could not believe the results! After 3 weeks of drilling (2x a week) in my local pool, I am just astounded @ the difference in my swimming. No more struggling--just so easy. I actually enjoy going to the pool, and I don't have to bring any kind of props like buoys, flippers, etc. Just Me! I know this is going to be so extremely helpful in any tri I do, especially longer ones--no wasted movement--saves you for the bike/run legs! Highly, highly recommend TI, especially if you can attend a workshop."
1,Polar bear style for retirees,"When I ordered swimming instructions, I expected a pro to show the best muscle movement. My kids may or may not participate Olympics when they grow up, nevertheless they'll learn the professional movements in any sport they try. The guy in the video is no Michael Phelps, but a round belly polar bear, whose posture are in every ways against fluid dynamics. Please, mark your DVD in the appropiate category: the title should say ""fun ways to swim for retirees""."
1,This Video is Gross,"Ok, so I've been forewarned by the other one-star, DZheng. Didn't think it was going to be this gross, though. The author/actor has a pot-belly. His back is sunburned, hairy and blubbery. And he swims like an old man who has trouble moving. So disgusting, I couldn't bear to spend more than five minutes before stopping the DVD. I am throwing it awa. FYI, I am 60, try to eat right and exercise right and am within five pounds of my high school weight. The author/actor should look after his general health, first and foremost, not be promoting a sport like swimming."
1,Alvin and the Chipmunks - A Chipmunk Christmas,Great entertainment for the kids. They loved it and have been watching the movie again and again. Has some nice lessons in life which hopefully they can learn from.
4,ALLLLVIIIIN!!!!,"This DVD is quite refreshing. Not only does it have the 1980 classic A Chipmunk Christmas, but it has two Christmas episodes from the Chipmunk series, doing their versions of a Christmas Carol and It's A Wonderful Life in their own cute way. A great addition to any Christmas collection.The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is I'm a little disappointed there were no special features on this DVD. Alvin has been a great addition to Christmas ever since the release of that classic song ""The Chipmunk Song"" (1958). Some things on that could have been added. But I'm still glad to have Alvin and the Chipmunks as part of my Christmas."
3,more is less?,"oops. I saw Apocalyptica live in D.C. with their drummer and I rescind all previous comments about percussion being a bad idea.Yes, I like Reflections. Yes, I love Apocalyptica, and this album is good and I'm happy that someone had the sense to release it in the States. But here's the thing. Part of Apocalyptica's appeal was the fact that their music was exclusively created by cellos. On ""Inquisition Symphony"" they even boasted about this. On ""Cult"", Path Vol. 2 (when they brought in a vocalist) was really f'in cool. Yes, I'm glad that they want to experiment and ""expand their sound"" and I want the group to feel free creatively, but the addition of percussive elements on some tracks on this album seems to take away from their unique, original butt-kickin' nature, the feeling of ""Oh my god, they made all this crazy noise with just /cellos/?!"" So, Apocalytpica is still doing well, but I fear with the addition of other instruments they have become just another orchestral metal band."
3,"Good symphonic metal album, NOT a good Apocalyptica album","Had I maybe downloaded this album, perhaps I wouldn't have felt as gypped as I did when I listened to it after purchasing it. I liked this album quite a bit, however it just doesn't feel like an Apocalyptica album at all. I guess if less is more, more is less. The best thing about Apocalyptica was that all they played wsith was cellos and nothing else. They pretty much carved their niche without Vocals or cellos. That said, this is good as a typical symphonic metal CD, but not so much an Apocalyptica CD. There are good songs on here like Cohkka, Somewhere Around Nothing, Heat, and Toreador II, but just beware of the previous claims I made."
4,coby mp3,very easy to operate. Downloads well and saving your place is better than others that cost more.
4,COBY MP3 player,"I love this thing! I put music on it, haven't used it for data files as yet, but I like the idea of being able to combine the two. It plays well, and is easy to operate and to load music onto."
1,coby mp3,coby mp-c885 mp3 is not good %$#^ it would not even power up the first time the vendor I bought it from was great and gave me a quick refund
2,Works OK but USB broke,I bought this player so I could listen to music while jogging. For that purpose it has worked fine. Unfortunately the USB interface stopped working after about a month. In other words it still plays music but I am no longer able to put any new music on it. Others have mentioned this as well so my advice is to make sure you copy over all the music you want early on.
3,well worth the money,"i haven't had any problems with this mp3 player thus far and I have had it for about 3 weeks. The battery has yet to die and the volume is just fine. You get what you pay for. It absolutely does its job. The earphones are made a little akwardly, but no major problems other than that."
3,Coby MP-C885 1 GB Flash mp3,The second one worked. Coby help line really wasn't familiar with MAC computers. There only suggestion was send it back. My son has a different Coby model that just like this one doesn't recover space when you remove songs with a MAC - does with a PC. Coby apparently thinks iTunes is a fad. The manual is no help for MAC users.
2,Not up to par,Your get what you pay for. Very hard to switch programs. Buttons are a pain. Would not buy again.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I have never posted a review of an item on Amazon before, but I felt it necessary to warn people away from this. I read many negative reviews of this mp3 player, but I thought it was only $15, so I would try it. I now have had it for 3 weeks and it has worked about twice. I wanted it for my runs and bike rides, but it consistently does not turn on. This piece of junk sucks. Don't buy it."
1,Don't Buy It,"It didn't work out of the box. It looks poorly constructed, so I didn't even ask for an exchange."
4,Great for the price,This is a great MP3 player for the price. It has nice sound works well. It does have some downsides. The headphones are pretty worthless if you want to use it for working out. The menus are a little hard to understand at first but okay once you get used to it. The pain is that you have to create a folder for each song to make a playlist. But all in all a good product.
1,terrible - not working right out of the box,"got product, powered on, no display visable. the sound from the fm radio was nice, but there was no display. spoke with coby customer service, they had never heard of this problem. suggested return to amazon. wont try that brand again."
2,short-lived,"Great while it lasted (only through three battery changes). On-Off button ceased to work, after opening it up I found the fragile (tiny, very tiny!) plastic ""holders"" for the on-off element had come loose. No way --no space--to solder/glue/press them back on. The player would work if...oh well. On to another brand next time."
1,"looks great, but didn't work with my computer","I really liked the idea of this item; as small as a flash drive, big enough capacity for working out or the commute, but when it came time to getting it to work with the new iTunes, no luck. The product *thinks* it works with iTunes but if the computer won't support the product, there's not much you can do about that! Had to send it back.... but I still LIKE the idea. If you're on PC I'm sure it's fabulous."
1,Wont PLay with USB input Car radios,"I have a couple of stick players and the Coby unit will not operatein USB input car stereos. Only plays back on computer or headphones.DO NOT purchase any Coby products if you intend to use them withcar stereos, they are not usable in this manner. Stick with the Creative brand for this purpose, they are trouble free."
2,Not worth it,"I originally bought this because I have an older ipod which had poor battery life, however this player was not worth the money. I bought it because it was one of the few smaller players that was compatible with mac, but many times when I transfer the songs from my computer to the player they do not transfer. This can be very frustrating, and takes up a lot of unnecessary time."
5,"WORKS AS INTENDED, NO COMPLAINTS","I've had this for over a year and no problems whatsoever. I didn't have a whole lot of expectations when I purchased it due to the low price (about $30 at Big Lots), but so far so good. I loaded music from my own CDs using Windows media player, no software necessary. I love the fact that you can lock it, so it won't accidentally turn itself on and waste batteries.Is convenient that it works with one AAA battery, so you won't have to throw away the whole player when the battery stops charging (I'm talking to you iPod Nano - never again!!!)I have not used the earbuds that came with it, so I cannot comment on that. Nor have I used the radio or recording function, I just use it to play music without carrying around a whole bunch of CDs, so it does work well for its intended purpose."
1,Unreliable,"First couple of days I was pleased with this player and the ability to be a thumb drive. But then it stopped playing entire songs and when downloaded to it would ""lose"" half of the book I wanted to listen to. I have since returned this item and purchased a Sansa an love it."
1,player,"I'm having trouble with the formatting of music files for the player, most likely the reason is my Operating System is Windows ME."
1,NO voice recorder! again NO voice recorder,i bought this for the voice recorder.but it doesn't HAVE a voice recorder.you just can trust anybody these days.everything i buy from COBY is junk.
3,An architecture reference book,"This is a big book. It should be used as a reference book. If you're truly working in the enterprise architecture arena, only get this book. For example, it covers a great deal in how to setup virtual enterprises and virtual organizations - which most architects won't have much use for. It also covers GERAM and GERA in detail, which is good. But, it barely touches on Zachman framework and how it fits in the GERAM framework, and it does not even touch on TOGAF. At the end of the book, it has some excellent case studies. Overall, this book is more suited for academia than the professional community. If you have lot of time and need a much deeper understanding of the architecture profession, then this book is for you."
2,Not worth it,"This is an overpriced set of poorly edited articles written by different authors. For people that are interested in Enterprise Architecture, I recommend checking out the TOGAF book (which btw, is available freely online at the OpenGroup website)"
2,Just the basics,"I was a little disappointed by the content of this training manual. The author assumes zero previous health and fitness knowledge, and consequently rehearses the basic priciples most of us learned in fifth grade gym class.I expect most racers who are serious enough to buy a specialized training guide are looking for motocross-specific exercises and training routines. Instead we get running, pushups, and a reminder that junk food is not good for us. Also the writer repeats himself a lot, and his overused metaphors are not funny."
5,great book,"Great book. No games. to the point and easy to follow. It also happens to be the only current book out there. Other than this I have had to look up old Husky manuals, Brad lackeys book, Ake jonsons the technique of motocross , among others that are 20-30yrs old. It is great that the only book out there is pretty good. Like all training books the real test is if you really do what is prescribed."
1,The poison is in the tail,"Yes, this book is well written; yes, the printing details are apt to delight every book lover, but I know I am not the only one who threw away this book in disgust nearing the end (I talked to several other people lured by the interesting printing subject.). Rather sneakingly, it turns suddenly to be a very anti-European, anti-Catholic, anti-socialist (yes; European=Catholic=Socialist=Very Bad) right-wing conspiracy theory book. The European Union as the anti-Christ, a plot for the Vatican and Labour Parties to take over the world from God-loving American Conservatives; there might be Americans who love this stuff, but nobody with any intelligence."
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST,"WOW! WOW! WOW! Simply the best music video performance I have ever seen. My most favorite video of any type. Simply unbelievable talent. Considering she was aged 50 when she knocked out this performance, I'm in awe. She looks 30 and has the energy and stamina of a teenager and a voice that delivers raw emotion. She just rocks, what more can I say. WOW!!!"
4,Thick but solid,"I needed floating shelves for my new apartment and had already purchased shorter ones, which I loved. So when these arrived and were installed nearby, they looked absurdly thick and bulky. As time passed, however, I got used to them and am able to put heavy display items on them."
3,"RCA. A bad modem,but it's working great if you fix the power connector.","Same problem as everybody else,bad connection on the power supply plug(the one that go into the modem).The connection was dropping from any movement of the modem or from any vibration.I found a way to fix this problem.The modem have four pins for power.All you have to do is bend the four pins from the modem,one up,one down,one up,one down(the modem is in horizontal position),but be carefull to not bend them too much.Now my modem work great,no more problems."
1,Poor connectivity,"We've had one of these for 2 years now, and we've finally given up and bought a Motorola Surfboard 4200.The RCA DCM226 has always given us spotty connections. At first, AT&T found a rusty connector in the street, but we still had spotty connections after they fixed that problem. Our connections would go out for days at a time, for no apparent reason. AT&T could detect the modem trying to find an uplink signal, but it would never lock, just range cycled endlessly.My brother recommended the Motorola after using one of those for a year with no problem, and within seconds after connecting all the cables, it locked and got connectivity."
2,Rmmmmm... *crash*,"I have had this modem for about 10 months (came with comcast@home kit) and we've had a lot of with it losing the signal (only split once, against my wishes) and having to reset it.But it was running fine until this week, where it cannot find the signal for the life of it. We have three lines in and tried several configurations with no luck. Thank god its only a rental. I am buying a Linksys (only because Netgear doesn't make them)."
1,Unreliable and not worth buying,"Like other reviewers, I also lose connectivity with this machine. More specifically, if I nudge the modem accidentally while I work or if I wiggle the cable to which it is connected (which happens when I vacuum), I lose my internet connection. My anonymous and evil broadband service provides this machine, and I have had it for about two years. I am currently shopping to replace it with another machine and return it to the evil cable company."
3,Great camera work -- kinda stupid presentation.,"I love great theme park footage and this DVD is packed withit. If only the people in the video were a little lessannoying, it would be the perfect video. Still, it'sgot great visuals and a good collection of footage.If you like roller coasters, you can't really gowrong with this one."
1,Totally unimpressed,"I had always considered the Rev-A-Shelf brand to be high quality items. This was just cheap plastic molded stuff that has the option of being broken/cut into smaller pieces. I guess I should have expected something like this, but for the price, I expected better plastic?"
4,Expect the unexpected!,"In the suspense thriller CHOKE, the reader is sent in a hundered directions never quite able to stay ahead of Stuart Woods artful writing. Chuck Parish, the main character, is a tennis pro involved in scandal and murder while giving tennis lessons during the week under the warm Florida sun. The only way out of this mess is the truth, and this leads the reader around in circles, until the final pages, where the plot is unfolded before their eyes. CHOKE is definately worth four stars; a modern, scandalistic, suspense thriller, with some unexpected twist and turns."
1,stuart woods,"the books have yet to arrive so they cant be reviewed, i had ordered them as a gift and they have nto been deliveried"
4,Worthy of a second read,"I read this book many years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. On a plane ride back from Italy, I found myself with nothing to read so I again read the book which my husband had just finished. Once again, I loved the characters and became engrossed in the characters. Stuart Woods has a real talent for the creation of intriguing characters and I am always impressed with their evolution."
1,"cheap, shallow male fantasy","Worst book I've read in ages. Bought it hardcover out of the discount bargain bin, and still felt like I wasted my money. No depth of character at all; just pure male ego/fantasy. All the women are beautiful and can't wait to get into his pants. He's handsome and strong, and everybody admires him (for absolutely no reason). Oh, please, give me a break."
4,Choke,"I really enjoyed the twist & turns this book took, just when I knew who did it I realized I was wrong. I enjoyed the characters & how they interacted, very enjoyable you really liked everyone even the ""bad"" guys!"
5,Another stupendous mystery by Woods,"I've listened to at least a dozen of Woods' novels on tape, all of the Stone Barrington novels and a good amount of the others. Everyone of them has kept me entertained from the first page to the last. This one was particularly interesting and had a great number of twists to it as most of Stuart Woods' novels do. He's become one of my favorite authors and every book is different. The ideas he comes up with are great...and the reader for his novels on tape is simply excellent."
1,Couldn't stoop low enough to read all of this one,Stuart Woods has written a lot of really bad books -- and a few good ones. This one was so trashy -- and so poorly written -- that I couldn't get past 50 pages. I need a hot shower. Yuk!
4,It's okay,"I previously used Pagemill 3.0 and never could figure out GoLive. That one was too hard for me. I think the negative reviews here are puzzling. These people must not have read the manual, which you have to print out yourself, because it explains how to do things. You can visit the site I built at www.mindspring.com/~rmjournal/index.html Not fancy, but it functions."
1,Skip it.,"Looking for a replacement for old standby Claris Home Page, I found Freeway Express 3.5. This was true ""you get what you pay for."" It was extremely unintuitive and hard to figure out. I switched to Adobe GoLive, which costs a fortune by comparison, but was far, far easier to understand. Unfortunately, this program is not even worth if for free."
3,Not For Everyone,"The 'Miracles' DVD set is my least favorite of the 'Unsolved Mysteries' releases so far. Most of the stories tend to be very redundant, with some life threatening obstacle such as frostbite being overcome through seemingly divine intervention. To its credit, all of the stories are very inspirational (for those who are seeking that) but I prefer the spooks that I've come to associate with 'Unsolved Mysteries'. I did, however, enjoy some of the more historical religious stories such as Our Lady of Guadalupe and the Shroud of Turin. These featured some fantastic movie-worthy recreations and were simply more mysterious than some guy suddenly coming out of a Coma. In closing, I think those who are more religiously inclinded will find this set the most enjoyable. For others, I would recommend some of the other 'Unsolved Mysteries' sets such asUFOsandGhosts."
4,Very Good,"I held off on buying this for years, but I'm glad I finally did. Being Catholic, I find the Catholic-related stories to be the best. ""Lucky School"" was a very good non-denominational story. ""Lucky Choir"" proves that a coincidence is a miracle in which god wishes to remain anonymous. Some stories however do not fit, like ""Police Woman Savior"" and ""Money From Heaven."" ""Kentucky Visions"" was about people who are just too eager to believe in miracles. Some seem to be paranormal in nature but later appear to have an Earthly explanation, like ""Miracle Staircase."" ""M.S. Miracle"" really straddles the line between luck and miracle. Overall, enjoyable and positive stories."
5,Great read.,"The author is obviously well-acquainted with biblical history, geography, and theology. He weaves biblical fact into a powerful story which gives tremendous insight into the life and times of the prophet Elijah."
4,The benefit of narrative in understanding the Bible.,"The benefit of hearing the whole story behind the Biblical account is that it fills in the gaps,it gives a vivid description of the history,culture,religions,time lines,that give not more credence, but more explanation.This is a compelling book on the times,state, and reasons, for God to do what He was doing in the days of Elijah."
3,eBook formatting fails for Kindle Paperwhite,"[seeing this was released in 2009, presumably in eBook format, I have to excuse the flaw...unfair to blame the publisher for a flaw that wouldn't have existed on the readers of four years ago]. Failing to clear out the font definitions leaves a book that cannot be set to the 6 different options on Paperwhite, at least. Since it has newly come up for free, I erroneously thought it was recent release. Still, Tyndale ought to re-format it and put up a corrected version.The reviews look very good and I will read it in sans-serif and comment more later."
3,A journey to find jeans,"The book that I read was Million Dollar Jeans. It's a pretty good book. I would recommend it to other people if they like books that have no category to go into besides the fact that it makes you think, ""I wish I won a million dollars""My book was about two boys named Twig and Tommy. Some lady dropped her wallet in the store and the boys returned. She bought them a lottery ticket and Saturday night the lottery tickets number's come on and Tommy remembered the numbers because it was the same numbers as his birthday was on, 2-9-4-7-3. He left the lottery ticket in this pants and his dad gave his pants to his church. Tommy and Twig went on a journey to find his pants."
5,Great for sports or everyday wear,"I ordered several back supports looking for one I could wear when playing tennis or other athletic activities. This is the best I've found. It is very simple in design and can be worn under clothing without being obvious. And it breathes. While not really cool, it certainly is cooler than any other I have tried. I am buying a second one as the one I purchased is always in the wash."
5,Truly a treat,"This is a beautiful little book which features photographs of precious jewels fashioned by some of the great jeweler/artists of the past three centuries. The Lalique and Cartier pieces shown here are not the same ones you'll find in every other jewelry book. The quality of the photography and printing is first class. If you love fine art jewelry, or insects, or both, you'll enjoy this book."
5,Faith CD,Our daughter was returning from Europe and this CD came out while she was gone so I wanted to get it for her & couldn't find it anywhere- Then I thought of Amazon and they had it and got it to me next day. Our daughter loves it! Thanks Amazon!
5,Jap Rock at its best,This is Hyde at his Best. The variety in his music is amazing. If you like soul in your music then listen to this. Hyde is a musical master and should be awarded as the best there is.
5,awesomeness!!,"hyde's fourth solo album faith is amazing!! he is my favorite japanese singer. not only is he pretty but his vocals are fantastic as well. this is a chance to support hyde and buy one of his cds for a reasonable price instead of the really expensive import one. i am buying this in hopes that he will sign it in anaheim. support hyde so that he knows he is loved in the U.S. as well as in japan. in addition, the majority of the songs are in english so you can understand what he is singing. on top of that, i'm pretty sure that the cd comes with romanized lyrics because tofurecords released it and they usually do so you can still sing along to the parts that aren't in english. the lyrics are really moving and my favorite new tracks are (even though i love all his songs): made in heaven, dolly, faith, & mission. plus the U.S. version comes with bonus stuff that the japanese release didn't have ^_^.~<3christine"
1,Don't beleieve the hype people!,"Influenced by the glowing review claims here""as to how good this product smells""i choose 2 purchased this product.Needless 2 say,not only is this not so,but like the ultra downy w/scent pearls(blue bottle,pink top)the scent nearly overwhelmed me and permeated the air in my basement 4 hours on in!And yes,i diluted it when adding it to my rinse cycle!So buyers beware,don't let the glowing reviews and vanilla component fool yah this product is quite pungent smelling!"
3,"Not a cartoon, but a fairly good video.","My grandsons, aged 3 and 5, have enjoyed this video. The cover might make one think it's a cartoon, but it's actually quite factual, showing the inside of working submarine. Not a video they'll watch over and over, but they did learn from it and will watch it from time to time."
4,Dense but good,"I agree with a previous review that this book is so dense that it must be read in short intervals, but it was an extremely good learning experience. It never ceases to amaze me how a society can put so much faith in a supreme leader and never rise up against atrocities. Stalin was certainly a monster but I never fully appreciated how good a diplomat he was and how he capitalized on Russia's sacrafices to shape the map post World War 2 and the enabling role both the U.S. and U.K. played in this. My one complaint with the book is that it spends too much time on intraparty struggles and politics that gets a little boring at points and becomes repetetive. All in all a good read, but don't bring it to the beach!"
3,"Inside Creedence , No music ..only interviews","I received yesterday These documentary( Thanks Amazon.com Quick service)But talking about the documentary i expected complete musicals from the ed Sullivan appearences & Johnny Cash show & the concert , but there are only interviews with Stu Cook ( CCR bassist ) & no more.The ""Proud mary"" clip from Sullivan apaperend in many times of the interview but not complete so you must to buy Ed Sullivan 60s show fro the complete clip? yes i think so.I understand there exist a rare DVD with foreign musical clips of Creedence made in Brazil i think that this site offers , is another option for Creedence fans who wanst to watch COMPLETE VIDEO CLIPS OF CREEDENCE CLEAWATER REVIVAL.."
3,Average Movie Rising.,"All- in- all, I guess I can't really say it's bad just not as good as it should be. They're a little critical about Creedence and I was surprised to see that they had wrong inmformation about a song. It really seems that some of the reviwers don't even want to be there and interviews could of been done better. But, it shows you the struggles the band encountered and the triumphs quite effectively. The interviews should have included John, or maybe Dough but all-in-all it's pretty average. I did think, however, that the music videos were pretty good."
2,Inside Creedence Clearwater Revival,"I must say I am truly impressed with the great efficiency of the shipping as well as the way my order was processed. There is however one thing that is of great displeasure to me and that has to do with the contents of the product itself. For all intents and purposes, these two DVDs (Inside Creedence Clearwater Revival and Music in Review) are nearly identical. Both DVDs are about Creedence Clearwater, granted, but except for an extra commentator on one DVD, these two are nearly the same and frankly, I find neither to be all that good. One DVD, even claimed we would see COMPLETE live performances of a small list of songs, which was unfortunately not true at all."
2,Well...,"Well...It was my mistake , I saw the one about Deep Purple from these guys. I was expecting a different type of story. However it tells you the story of CCR if you has no idea of them, but I would not pay this money for this piece of information again if this DVD got lost.ivank."
1,Dumb,"All of the Critical Review series are absolute rubbish. Who ever reviewed this before me must work for the company that makes them, because he reviewed it before the release date. Avoid this at all cost."
3,Are you kidding me?,"You are, aren't you? Of course there is concert footage on DVD of CCR. And I'm not talking bootlegs. The sound is a little sucky but still worth it. You can get the Royal Albert Hall concert, Oakland Arena concert, 2 songs from Woodstock and some rehearsal footage.Just do an Amazon search and look for the DVD's! Sheesh!Bjorn OnTheBayou"
1,No star at all if it were up to me!,I agree 100% with Stephen Smith. If I am not mistaking King Crimson members even warned their fans because of the poor quality of the contents.Furthermore I cannot find one reason for the first reviewer to why he thinks Stu Cook is a authority on the sound of CCR. It was his and Doug Cliffords' antics that produced an album like Mardi Gras.
1,Offensive humor and offensive recipes,Don't waste your money. This book is offensive in it's sexist humor and it's not a real cookbook.
4,Finally a fun cook book,"Finally someone has written a cookbook that is also fun to read. Chef Ted explains in his book that if you can follow simple directions then you can cook. Having hardly ever cooked before (Does macaroni and cheese in a box count?) I set forth to try out some of Chef Ted's recipes. And he is right. I can cook. The meals turned out pretty good I think.Practically every female I have asked said that they want a man to cook for them. Chef Ted not only explains how to cook for your lady but also what else to do as far as preperation and accessories.The pictures of the food are well done. That way I can know what it is supposed to look like.Chef Ted also adds his comments with his own down to earth style.Next step, down to the store to get some liquid nitrogen for Chef Ted's Liquid Nitrogen Ice Cream!I recommend that you buy this book today."
4,Good buy,I bought this case for a trip I was taking to England. It is a very good case. It held up tp baggage handlers and the flights with out a scratch! My Ovation was even in tune when I opened it! Now the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the smell. The release agent from the mold is still out gassing. It is horrible! Read other reviews to get more detail. It is dissipating slowly. I would suggest keeping it on your patio open to let it air out.Other than that it is a great case!
5,Excellent Book on Personal Finance,"This was a great book on personal finance. I've recently been starting to get interested in finance and have been reading several books. This book would be great as a introduction to personal finance or just a refresher. Its not a dry read like most finance books. I found I didn't want to put the book down.With that said, the book is a bit out dated and there are several sections that really don't apply today (how to save money on home telephones). It would be great if a new revision came out! But you can just skip the sections that don't apply and not miss much.Jason Kelly is an excellent writer for finance, I've read several of his books now and would recommend him to anyone."
2,Uhhh...,Wasn't this guy in Glassjaw? I guess this stuff sells better... people need to make a living and girls will buy anything.Let us hope for a new Glassjaw record sooner rather than later.
3,Not as good,"Head automatica's first album is great. Every song sounds different and i've never heard anything like it. They're not as heavy or as out of control as glassjaw, but it is an almost perfect album. Daryl Palumbo is getting older and it shows. And on theyre new album it really shows. Most of the songs sound the same. A cross between Blues Traveller, and the band that sings Mr Jones(I cant think of their name right now). There is a few standouts that are really good. As a whole its just doesn't stand up against the first one and thats too bad."
2,"Good band & songs ruined by ""emo"" vocalist and producer","I was ready to embrace this CD until the singer chimed in. In fact, the songs are so good that I listened to each one in hopes that I could get past ""that voice"". Yes, you know the one. Whether there is only one over-enunciating, over-modulating, whiney-sounding and mixed-too-loudly singer in all of emo or not (as is the speculation), this guy's voice intrudes here to ruin what could have been a great record. It's the sound, as in all of emo, of a singer trying way, way too hard to be heard and an emo producer enabling him, resulting in the listener tuning it all out. What a shame, as a singer and producer with a true feel for the Elvis Costello/Jags/Yachts sound could have made a real gem with this one."
2,No Automator No Sales,Just goes to show you that the Automator is one of the most underrated producers in the industry
3,..and the attractions??,"Head Automatica did their homework on this one...Listened to ALOT of ELvis Costello and the Attractions, took some notes and made one of the best albums Elvis Costello forgot to make. Which is why I cant give this more stars..I love Elvis Costello, and since this album isnt all that original..I cant love it. Great songs, catchy, poppy and whole crap load better than Decadance...Pick this one up and then go listen to Elvis Costello and the Attraction's-Armed Forces record. I guess this album will attract the young kids to the KING of British rock, and thats always good..Buy this one!"
2,Pretty much junk.,"When talented artists with unusual and eclectic style decide they want to make a 'pop' album, it usually actually turns out pretty well. 'Decadence' was a very decent CD, although I would much rather hear Daryl Palumbo put his vocal ability to better use with GlassJAw.Other artists have taken similar directions lately- I love Mike Patton's 'Peeping Tom,' when is the Faith No More singer's attempt at creating what he thinks pop should sound like...and it sounds magnificent.What makes 'Popaganda' different? It doesn't target pop, it IS pop. I hate to be cliched and use the term 'sell out,' but I can't see anyone with serious musical tastes actually liking this CD. Seems to me that it's nothing more than an attempt to attain a mainstream audience and more money- the whole disk is nothing but pure radio fodder with some of the weakest vocals Daryl has ever put out.Go back to GlassJAw and make good music again, Mr. Palumbo."
4,Blue Green Orange,"The case was busted, but that's not what I care about. The cd book is in great condition and most importantly the cd is in perfect condition. No hassels, would purchase from seller again. Great buy!The shipping was weird because it was sent from PA to AZ to NY? But that fuel waste was on UPS."
4,Not bad. Very good album,I miss the old I Mother Earth. Although you can hear a great effort on this disc. Love that this band is still making good music!
3,A well written book of time travel,"The book seemed to be boring in the beginning, but as things unfolded they caught your attention."
5,Three Lives to Live,"This is wonderful book written by Anne Lindbergh (the daughter of Charles Lindbergh)about a girl, Garet Atkins (age 13) and a mysterious laundry chute. Garet lives with her grandmother Gratkins (short for grandmother atkins) when suddenly a third person enters their lives. Daisy Atkins, a strange girl wearing an old fashioned peach-colored party dress falls into Garet's basement and into her life. This story is a autobiography that Garet is writing for her 7th grade english teacher. Daisy's true identity is never explained to Garet and she is determined to figure out just who this prettier, smarter, more polite, ""twin"" is."
1,What did I order??,"I ordered this product thinking it would be what I have been buying from the store. I was so disapointed omg.. This product was nothing but oil with no pigment. Please, don't buy it only to return it from here. I was really upset that I had to return it."
2,Not entirely sure the product was legitimate,"I've been using a NW25 concealer as my winter shade and recently started tanning again and it was getting too light. I purchased this product in NW35 which is my normal summer shade. When I went to use it, the coverage was incredibly sheer, even when set and layered. Though it matched my skin perfectly, it wasn't able to cover the imperfections and even out my skin tone like my NW25 was... Probably will not purchase this specific one again."
4,Pretty good basic MP3 boombox,"Looks very nice; Digital controls; Seems like well-built, not a cheap-feeling plastic device; Sound quality using good headphones (not included) is outstanding. Sound quality through built-in stereo speakers is decent for the size and price. Can be run from any 120V. AC outlet.It works well for what it was purchased: to be able to listen to audiobooks in an MP3 format, while I am working on a major home remodeling project. Not an audiophile-type product, but good for what it was intended."
5,"good gloves, not heavy duty","These are great for a younger goalie or maybe a practice pair for an older goalie. The stitching and material are SO much better then the other ones at this price point. You can actually have a full range of motion instead of barely being able to move your fingers. For younger goalies, the foam is so thick and over-sized on the cheap pairs, they can barely even grab the ball once they stop it.The down side is that because they are not quite as thick, they do wear out, and there are no finger saves. My 11yo loves them, but when in the next year or two, I will probably move him up to thicker foam and finger saves when the boys start hitting a lot harder."
4,glovess,I bought these gloves and i really liked them. The grip is really nice and they are more of a tight on your hands. But if you do buy these gloves and you playing a higher level soccer i would buy a few pairs cause they do seem to fall apart on the hands or tip of your fingers.
4,diadora olimpico goal keeper glove,I bought two pair.....one for each of my two sons. One is 10 and the other is 8. It's all about the gear for the two of them. The stitching has endured their daily use.
3,soccerfan,I got these for my daughter. The quality is very good but they didn't fit her. They were wide in the palm but short in the fingers.
5,The Best,"It's the best, that's all. The Fire Ball is cheaper but not a great as The Raider. Just get this one, it makes Duncan look like a joke."
3,There's better.,"The Yomega Raider will feel like a great yoyo if Yomega is all you've ever known. However, there are better yoyo's in the $10-$20 price range. The best overall beginner yoyo is the YoYoFactory FAST 201. It's a ball bearing yoyo with an adjustable string gap, what more do you want for $9.99? If you like looping, check out the YoYoFactory Loop 720 or the YoYoJam Sunset Trajectory NXG. Both are great loopers, though the Raider can be modified to be better than either. It's worth noting that this modification risks cracking the yoyo. If you like string tricks, check out the YoYoJam Lyn Fury, or the YoYoFactory Precedent."
2,It's really hard,"I realize this book is about ""The Witch of Wall Street"" but it's really hard to read a book about a woman who shows absolutely no likeable characteristics during the entire book. She seems to have started out conniving and manipulative and moved on to devious and cheap. If Hetty Green really was this bad why bother writing a book about her? Stick with someone people can identify and maybe even sympathize with."
5,The complicated made humorous,"The book is the perfect companion for a rainy night. Benet is startling in his lucid and gentle exposure of the myriad of character flaws the has plagued humanity since the beginning. He died during the second world war after dedicating his talents to exposing the true mission of the axis cause. His ""Into Egypt"" is the perfect vehicle to describe racial intolerance and historical short-sightedness, while the Devil and Daniel Webster sheds humorous light upon a bygone era of american folklore. This book is not to be missed in anyones lifetime. For those who has had a bad experience purchasing a product that needs assembly, reference his ""Letter to Bloomingdale's:-"" for he demonstrates how to get all your points across, and your shot in the bull's eye and still not compromise personal integrity."
1,The embryology Anatomy and Histology of the eye,The paperback 2010 reprint does not contain any of the figures in the book. This makes the book essentially worthless to the reader because more than 70 different figures are mentioned in the book.
2,doesn't grab my interest,"Couldn't get interested in the story, tried to read a couple of chapters, will probably try again since I paid for it."
4,Good Read,"This was my first Ed McBain and I'll certainly be going back for more. Great characters, good flow, hard to put down."
5,A Classic Pop Album!!,"Handsome Poets' ""Rebirth"" Cd is an absolute classic. I can't for the life of me understand how this band are not the superstars they are so clearly meant to be. From the first track to the last, each song is a gem, from the weird rumblings of ""Under Sea"" to the singalong ""President Bill"". If you enjoy melody and great tunes as well as superb musicianship you'll love this CD."
3,A decent book for an introduction to UML and UP.,"I particularly didn't like the way the author worded his explanations. Also, many of the terms and procedures that he describes he does with little detail. If I could find a book that is easier to read, and more in-depth, it would easily rate much higher than this book. However, I guess I have to give this book some credit. It does introduce you to the overall concepts and has a very good layout."
2,I dont like this book,I want to make a short comment here:1) This book is quite confusing. It mixed up the real story with the make up one.2) Saying that Ramanujun thought Goldbach Conjecture is wrong was a huge mistake. Everyone believe that Goldbach Conjecture is true. And Ramanujun is a real genius. I cannot stand this make up part.
4,addictive,I started watching this series a year ago. Now my husband watches it. We are both addicted.
5,Great!,"Being a Deadliest Catch fanatic, I love everything to do with Deadliest Catch! This is by far one of the best things I have bought!"
4,More Adventures in Lobster Fishing,"I was eagerly anticipating Season 2 of ""Deadliest Catch"" for more than one reason: firstly, I feel as if I really know all these guys and wanted to see what new adventures they were having and, secondly, I use the show as an example of ""alternative careers"" for my students where I teach business courses at an inner-city high school in Rhode Island. It is a true eye-opener for them as well as being entertaining! (Ironically, last spring, after showing a few of Season 1's episodes, one of my students lost her dad who was swept overboard while lobster fishing off the RI coast - his body was never found. It certainly reinforced how true ""Deadliest Catch"" really is.)I highly recommend the DVD for those who want to expand their knowledge and experiences while being entertained. I plan on buying ""Ice Truckers"" next, having heard it is just as fascinating."
3,First Romance Book A Good One,"This is the first Harlequin book I've ever read (and that was only because I got it free in the mail), but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a nice, smooth read that I couldn't put down.Just goes to show that a child-parent relationship doesn't have to be by blood, but the bonds of love are more important."
4,Unsolved Mysteries: Ghosts,"I watched the Unsolved Mysteries series as it appeared on TV. I always was entertained by it. It will be even better on DVD, as there will be no commercials. I actually bought this DVD set as a gift for someone who I know also enjoys the Unsolved Mysteries TV show."
3,Odd stories that didn't fit....,"The set is pretty good....but there are stories that simply don't fit into this set.""Mystery Hum,"" ""Mary Celeste,"" ""Ghost Blimp,"" ""Profiling the Paranormal,"" ""Lady in Black,"" (and to a certain degree) ""Highway Vision"" could have easily been dropped from this set.There were quite a few other ghosts stories that I recall from the series that could have taken their places, but didn't.Odd...."
2,The sound is awful.,I am disappointed. The sound is awful. The background music is too loud and can't hear Robert Stack. These discs are poorly made.
5,Best Ghost Collection On DVD Ever!!,"I have purchased and/or rented a lot of true ghost stories in the past and I am usually disappointed in them. This is by far the best collection I have ever seen, 6 hours worth of fantastic stories. The stories are interesting and detailed and it is hosted by the late great Robert Stack whom brings the quality up just by his mere presence. This set is well worth the price, anyone interested in true ghost stories will want to add this set to their DVD collection. The best set I have ever purchased."
5,A MUST! BELIEVABLE SPOOKY SPOOK!,This is the best of the ghost stories on Unsolved Mysteries and I can't recommend it enough. Most local libraries don't carry the series but it always resells on Amazon if you don't want to own it after viewing. Most if not all of these stories seem true or at least make you wonder about that bump in the night.
4,show is great but movie quality is not.,"These are great and I will probably go and buy the others but the only set back is the dvd quality kinda sucks. I didn't have a prob with sound like others my prob is the dvd's kinda freeze. this has happened twice on 2 of the 4 dvds. You don't miss any of the show and the ""freeze"" last about 1-2 seconds. It's not a big deal in my eyes and would buy them again for this price."
5,Explain to me again: WHY is this out of print?,"I've noticed a lot of outrageous deletions of historic classical recordings--many of them from Sony Classical--but this one has to take the cake. Aficionados may quarrel with George Szell's interpretations of the Brahms symphonies, or at least specific symphonies, but no one can doubt that the Cleveland Orchestra under Szell was one of the world's great orchestras, or that these recordings of Brahms are historical and musical documents of the greatest importance. These could still be made available to a wide audience at a bargain price, as they used to be. Why does Sony care so little about the treasures in its vault?"
4,The Main Event,"You've read Ambush at Corellia and Assault on Selonia, now it's time for the conclusion! Though it is a bit wordy at times with a tad too many plots happening all at the same time, it certainly concludes in an exciting manor. All is revealed and the truth comes out. I was hoping for a more extravagant final battle and for certain villians to be a little more difficult to apprehend, but it didn't matter... This series is here to let us know what our beloved Rebels are doing 14 years after destroying the Empire. I have a feeling that that little Solo boy will be seen again! Let's just hope its for the good of the galaxy..."
1,I hope George Lucas didn't read this crap.,"This book and this entire series were a disgrace to the Star Wars movies, and the other excellent books that have been written. Not only did the plot suck, but it was full of holes big enough to drive a star destroyer through. Like who exactly were the bad guys, how the hell could some piss-ant planet in a minor system be able to raise a fleet strong enough to combat the New Republic. Then of course why couldn't the New Republic send a large fleet in to kick ass, wasn't it but two years ago that they laid the smack down on the Yevetha (Black Fleet trilogy) with a couple of hundred ships. Anyway aside from the stupid plot this book was full of spelling mistakes, and the grammar was shocking as well. Hopefully this guy isn't allowed to write any other books, his finger should be cut off to insure this."
2,"Anakin, Anakin and more Anakin.","All this book cocentrated on was Anikin Skywalker. Also the ending was very dissappointing and badly rushed. The whole triloy was just a waste of time, because nothin of significance came out of this. Also many parts of the book is boring thos trilogy took me nearly 2 months t finish."
2,BBBBBOOOOORRRRRIIIIIINNNNNGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This trilogy may have started well, but it died young. The book was so wordy, and so much room was used exploring selonian culture, there was no room for action. the only part that had any suspense turned out to be nill, and the charackters were carved from wood. also, no giant action scenes at the end! All star wars sereises MUST have some sort of long action scene at the end! this thing Just sort of trailed of."
2,UGH! This wasn't worth the effort,"As a Star Wars fan it pains me to write this, but this Trilogy was an absolute flop. No character development, plot twists that you could see from a million mlies away, and bad editing all combine to make the worst Star Wars literature to date."
5,Star Wars Book,"I think this is the best book in the Corellian Trilogy. Second best is Assualt at Selonia (book #2). If you are thinking of reading the Corellian Trilogy skip the first book (Ambush at Corellia) the opening of Assualt at Selonia has a ""What Has Gone Before"" that adequately summarizes what was in the first book."
3,Above average conclusion to an above average trilogy,"The conclusion to the Corellian Trilogy is the best of the trilogy. The story really takes off and the action keeps the reader moving through the story at a good pace. All our heroes are in their prime ready to once again defeat the galaxy's evil. The biggest problem with this book is the ambiguity of the bod guys. Han Solo's cousin is just a front, and tis Triad are the real baddies but not much is really known or said about them. The author just kind of leaves them hangin so to speak. My other criticism deals with Anaking who is way to babyish in the beginnin gof the book and simply too sophisticated in the conclusion. OVerall however, this is a above average trilogy in the Star Wars universe."
2,Get some quality control on these books!,"Once again the lust for more easy profit from Star wars fans rears its ugly head. With this trilogy we get a somewhat tired tale where yet again the New Republic faces ""Probably it's greatest threat ever."" I am astounded that with all the threats the New Republic has overcome it is not yet strong enough to deal with a petty crook in less than three books. Why is it that the further away we get from Zahn and Andersson's books, the more backwards Luke and Leia's Jedi abilities seem to become. Surely this whole tale could have been shortened into one novel with a touch more ingenuity in the way the bad guys try to ruin/control the galaxy. Basically, this is not the worst Star Wars book you could read; but it almost is. Isn't it about time that Luke and Mara get it sorted and give us the patter of tiny Jedi?"
3,Bre's,"Yet again, the galaxy is faced with it's biggest threat ever. This super-weapon threat thing is starting to get on my nerves. Despite this, the plot and the characterisations are good, even thouhgh this child genius thing is getting a little hard to take. Why oh why can't the Solo kids just be normal? The writing is mediocre, nothing more. A book for die-hard Star Wars fans only."
2,Much potential and many ideas wasted,"I just finished this book and it mostly disappoints. Rushed ending, an original idea but the enemies were vague and somewhat unsinister; just like a mediocre movie, I kept thinking how the characters and ideas were wasted. Oh, and someone gets married (or at least it's implied) and another character dies. Won't tell you who but it wasn't done well. I wasn't emotionally involved. By the way, when is someone going to write a book that is less sci-fi and has more of the Force? THAT is Star Wars, not space battles and firefights. The Star Wars fans love the Force. It's the original thrust behind the whole storyline. Luke and Han are boring, unspecial characters in most of the books. Including here."
4,Better than expected,I was only looking for a roaster and bought this item on amazon.com. This roaster is built like a beautiful tank. I highly recommend this item. [...]
5,Excellent Roaster,"I love, love this roaster. My turkeys come out so yummy and moist. I cooked up to an 18lb. bird with no problems. It is a fantastic deal for the price. My mom bought a higher end roaster and this blows it out of the water."
5,Great Roaster,This product is great. First time in a while I have found a roaster large enough to cook a turkey that will feed my whole family. We love it. It was also very reasonably $$$$
5,The Start of One of Greatess Saga.,"This is one of the best stories for a game out there. The tale is very profund with a lot of capes of mistery. One's you played it, you always will be atracted to the fates of Nosgoth. Is a real pity that the developers of this great game, didn't make a new version for the new computers, I loved to see a 3D version!!"
1,Broken?,"It's small, light weight, looks pretty nice with the white X-box 360. Only catch I experienced was that it doesn't work. When I finally got this monitor and got it set up according to the instructions, booted it up and... Nothing but an ugly blue screen. So I unplugged everything, reset everything up again and booted once more to get the same results. A bit disappointed but I'll see if that changes after I can get this one traded back for a working one."
4,Promt delivery,Second time I bought this book. A necessity for preparing for the testing process for promoting within an orginazation. But the edition is old.
5,footster,"i have used the Saxon golden musk creme aftershave for over 10 years. when our local drug store stopped selling it i looked all over and could not find any other local retailer who stocked it so i have started buying it through amazon.com. My wife loves the scent, very manly, not to strong or overwhelming. And because it is a creme i only have to use a very little bit of it each morning. One bottle lasts me upwards of two months with everyday use. I shave with a razor and the Saxon creme cools and refreshes my face when i apply it. I would encourage any man who is looking for a great aftershave to try the Saxon Golden Musk creme aftershave."
3,"Smell good, feel good, look good","According to my hubby, this product works great. He doesn't use it as written on the bottle (only on special occasion) for it is just too expensive and difficult to find."
3,Smell,Doesn't Smell like the Golden Musk I used years ago. Had a bland smell. They must have changed the formula!!
2,This is not the original formula,"For those (like myself) who have been using this product since the late 80's, it is not the same formula. I have just received my latest shipment and, while it is cooling to the skin, there is NO musk scent. More floral (and definitely not the original scent). A search on leepharmaceutals.com showed they have lost their original supplier and this is the ""new formula"" saxon golden musk. I'm afraid it is not even close to the original. I won't be purchasing any more."
2,Saxon Golden Musk - Formula Change,"After receiving the Saxon Golden Musk product, I made a discovery. Lee Pharma has changed the formula of the product and it does NOT have the same fragrance that was the original product. I call Lee Pharma and inquired about the formula change and they said, ""they have been unable to get the fragrance that was the original formula and have changed it, but they had notified ALL of the retailers that sale the product!"" Why this has not been updated on all the web pages (including Lee Pharma) it not known. I will say that Lee Pharma did offer and I accepted to ""exchange"" the new product (Golden Musk) for their other product, Wood Spice."
4,Great watch,My husband loves this watch. His only complaint is that it will stop running even though he wears it all the time. If it stops he has to shake it for several minutes.
2,Re-edit and try again!,"I purchased this book based on the book's description and the ratings that other readers had given it. I was so interested in the book that I purchased it immediately after reading the reviews. At the beginning I was both impressed and intrigued. However, as I continued it just didn't turn out too be the thriller that I thought it would be. The book was very predictable and the characters seemed very unrealistic. There also seemed to be a lot of unnecessary characters and information. The one thing that bothered me the most about this book was the enormous about of grammatical and spelling errors. I actually began to take a pen out and make corrections. That's how frequent they were. The only reason why I'm giving this book a two is because it has the potential for a great story. Perhaps they should re-edit and try again."
5,Dangerously Delicious,"I had the pleasure of meeting Hope C. Clarke at the Harlem Book Fair this year and I must say, she's got it going on. Gorgeous woman and very approachable. I finally got around to reading Shadow Lover and the book is hot!!! I don't know if the girl writes erotica, mystery, horror or romance because she touched it all. Ivan Carty was brutal and sexy - what a combination! I would not have believed it possible to create such characterization. Her story line is tight too. She creates mini stories that are all linked together in the end and Ivan is tied into all of them.The girl is dangerously sexy and her writing is entertaining too. This is a must read - take it from a man who only reads non-fiction. I'm converted!!! I'm looking forward to reading Pent Up Passion."
3,Pretty good game for wut I paid for it,I got this game pretty cheap from amazon and it was worth it.
5,Sabrina the Teenage Witch Season Four,"Sabrina, the Teenage Witch - The Fourth SeasonGreat fun for the entire family. I just love this show. For any former Bewitched fans this is a good substitute in a modern way. It has great lessons for kids in morals and values as well as being very entertaining."
2,season let me down.,i like am in love with sttw. but this season truely let me down.-off to college-barely any magic-josh and brad;ew.-barely any helda/zelda/salemthis season was a big dissapointment honestly.
3,Greasy...,"This cocoa butter is GREASY! I was hoping for something not as greasy, but oh well. It does have the yummy cocoa butter smell and the grease feeling does fade once your skin soaks it up. I only recommend it for DRY skin...like winter time skin! It's just too heavy otherwise. I put it on after a shower or right before bed and wake up in the morning with lucious skin. You get a lot for the price though, so if you can handle feeling like a grease monkey for a little while the results are worth it. I'm trying to reduce the appearance of my silver stretchmarks, we'll see if it does anything!"
5,Absolutely the best!,It's been a long time since I've read a book more than twice. Of course it's also the first time I've read a book more than five times. It just keeps getting better! The wonderful combination of computers and fantasy is undeniable!
3,No Space Shuttle has ever been this high.,This photo was taken from one of the pre-landing Apollo missions. It's actually kind of famous for that reason. The space shuttle never gets high enough to see the entire disc of the earth. Please.

1,kiosk Rating <1,"Kiosk rating less than one means you rent it at a grocery store dispenser for a dollar for these reasons:First, standard cheap lucite monitor panels with CGI effects to make the movie seem futuristic. Very colorful and way over done for the past 20 years.Second, other special effects of which the budget allowed only a few such as the cartoonish Jetsons flying car and holographic floating reptile and blob.Third, actors that can list as their primary acting accomplishment the skill to read a line and robotically stand at the same time thus adding to a list in their filmography of mostly TV series/movies.Fourth, how many times can a story about a secret government project being usurped to some foreign higher bidder be told and so unimaginably."
5,Love the soundtrack,"The bonus soundtrack turned out to be as enjoyable and actually more used by my family, than the actual movie. The movie was very family friendly, action-packed and story line was good- really everthing I anticipated it being. The soundtrack included was something I wasn't expecting. I love it!!!!!!! I hope to hear more of the artists and songwriters who did the music."
1,Cliche City,You get lazy as a writer and you resurrect every cliche you can find and a few really long dead ones and you write a movie script and you call it The Jensen Project.
2,Wallpaper your litterbox with this book,"This book was worthless, quirky and amusing, but worthless for real tips. I hated the layout, the information on the companies was vague, the uses for the products were useless."
4,Great Insight,I am going through my first divorce and this book has really explained well how I got there in the first place. There are many stories that relate to different kind of situations. It is an easy read and would be helpful for people who would like to know why they are feeling the way that they feel. I highly recommend it.
4,Great help,"I got this book, when I first seperated, and just filed for divorce. Was going through so many emotions. This book helped me get through the days. It was so true to what I was feeling. I found it very helpful, and encouraging. I highly recommend it to anyone going through seperation/divorce."
5,Great book,I bought this book more to help others I talk to than for myself (I've been divorced 5 yrs and felt I was pretty settled with it). But I learned a lot about what happened in my divorce from this book. Made me understand some things better.
5,Crazy Time,"Hands down the best book I've read to prepare for my divorce. Very readable! Deals with the emotional upheaval, the ""what the hell happened"" feelings and the ""now what?"" questions. I've lent it to a friend and can't wait to get it back for a re-read."
3,Buy this book if you want to be scared out of your mind.,"This book did have some useful insights, but mostly it was focusing on extramarital affairs and the fearful side of divorce. It includes many excerpts from news of people who go crazy after divorce and kill their families. Not every marriage is divided by an affair. More focus should be put on verbal abuse. Also I think the author should have paid more attention to the fact that people going through divorce are afraid enough already and use calming and supportive words."
2,I could have written it,"I was really disappointed in this book because it said things I already knew, and in a very dry way. I didn't even finish the book. I'd recommend It's Called a Break-up Because it's Broken by Greg Behrendt and Amiira Ruotola-Behrendtinstead. You can be strengthened AND laugh at the same time!"
2,Not really what I was looking for...,"This book could easily be a 20-page report or pamphlet. Instead, the author uses A TON of different case studies - NONE of which were mine and really, they were boring to read after awhile. Kind of like when you're getting divorced and your heart is breaking - the last thing you care about is other people's relationships. I was looking for insight into how to proceed with a divorce, how to get on with my life and how not to repeat the same situation. The only thing this book taught me was some things to avoid/think about with my next relationship. The other thing I learned from her case studies were that 85% of the couples were cheating on his/her spouse. I found this very depressing."
5,A must for all going through divorce,I finished reading the book in 3 days and then gave it to my ex-wife. I think the author enlightened me into some of my own character flaws and helped me realize that it was't all my fault. It is probably one of the most important books I have ever read. It is a must for all those that are going through marital difficulties or those that have been divorced for years.
4,Ending the Roller Coaster Ride,Crazy Time: Surviving Divorce and Building a New Life has just the right tone to help someone stop playing the blame game and start healing. This book is an excellent tool for understanding the anguished feelings that arise when going through a divorce. I recommend adding this volume to the repertoire of anyone dealing with the traumatic divorce or separation situation.
5,Wow! Wish I could add a sixth star,"I've been separated for six months and just read Crazy Time. I'm stunned how the book covers what I felt, what I'm feeling, and I'd guess, what I'm going to feel. As I've been reading it non-stop for the last three days (nerdily highlighting and writing in the margins), I feel like I've grown enormously."
2,Not for young childless divorcees,"I'm sure this book could be helpful, but it was not applicable to my situation...a young divorcee with no children and no chaos surrounding my divorce. This book is for people who've been married for quite a while and have kids and lots of ""things"" tied up in their relationship. If you're experiencing lots of upheaval and chaos in your transition, then this may help, but if you're young and need to know how other young people are coping, don't look to this book for much insight."
3,I find the cause of divorce they give questionable,"In all, I found this book to be interesting and at some points, comforting. A fast and easy read, which did make me re-evaluate our relationship. I do question the repeated statements that the submissive spouse would be the one to cheat and leave . . . In my case, an abusive, alcoholic, adulterous, domineering husband left, dropping the bombshell that he was cheating for 6 out of 6 years. At a time when my self-esteem was crushed (""what kind of [person] am I that a [person}like him doesn't want me!"") it hurt worse that the betrayed spouse was portrayed as the domineering one . . . when my life, job, education and friends were all controlled by this man! Outside of one sentence in the entire book regarding alcoholism changing relationship dynamics, it didn't apply to my situation specifically. Taken with a grain of salt, however, it did open my eyes to many of the tactics he applies and how we related to each other."
5,Perfect Timing,"A friend of mine read this 4 years ago, 4 years after her divorce. I remember her raving about how it helped her see she wasn't losing her mind and if she was, it was normal. Now I'm needing to read it as well. Only 4 chapters in and I haven't felt more relieved that my roller coast of craziness isn't uncharted waters. An excellent resource and guide to finding your way out of the deep end of the pool. A must read!"
2,Not for Christians,"Book has some good parts, but some of her coaching and direction on how to heal did not meet with my value system."
2,What a joke!Two stars for a creative way to squeeze out cash,"In an poor attempt to make some money (like putting out guides to every other city is not enough) Zagat goes and creates a list of 1000 CDs that they consider to be the best of all time. Sounds great... if you don't know anything about music. The whole list reads like a great companion to the NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL MUSIC series for the people who only listen to the Top 40.If you are serious in your music tastes, stay away and stick with Pengiun guides.P.S.: Zagat, please stop the ""quotations"", it's a pain to read and besides we get it already... you're quoting reviewers"
1,Shallow and poor on examples,"The volume of the book is unnecessarily big due to repeated examples. The author introduces an element/syntax and repeates the previous example all over again with the new element. The quality of the examples isn't very good either such as car class derives from engine class. These kind of examples may be good for very beginners(i doubt that too) but take away the interest of a learned programmer who doesn't like to be fed with such basic stuff. As far as the coverage of C# is concerned its very basic without much conceptual depth. Chapter on SQL basics is unneceessary too since this book is about C# and not for introducing concepts which are unrelated to the subject. In nutshell, this book does not have any repeat value which will make you refer or read it again for real world problems.Take a quick look at it in a book store before buying rather going by positive reviews only."
1,Poor poor book,This is the worst C# book I have read.The book contains factual errors is poorly constructed and is only for the novice. Plus if you are a novice it is not a particularly good novice book either.I ordered this book mid December (prior to some other negative posts) when I recieved the book I mentioned it to a friend and he lent me his C# a complete reference. I therefore had the unique opportunity of reading them more or less in parrallel.If you want a book to move from any other programming language to .Net then try C# a complete reference. I do not think it is complete but it is much better than this book. There may be better books out there for an experienced programmer moving to C# if there are I have not yet seen them.
3,Same old,"It is not that bad but it is a typical computer book. Less than a 3rd of the pages are actually necessary, the rest is cut and paste code examples, the majoriy of which aren't really necessary."
2,Universally awful,"I bought this universal starter for a Fiesta grill to replace the original starter, which stopped working after only two uses. Sure enough, the GrillPro universal starter didn't make it past two uses either. The installation itself was as easy as advertised and it created a sizable spark initially, but the product doesn't seem to last at all.Why sell a starter for a grill if it can't stand up to the heat inside of a grill?? Sigh... Very disappointed."
4,Mostly univeral..,"The kit did work one installed in the BBQ, the only complaint I have is that the igniter button doesn't sit flush in the original opening. Since you push it, not pull, it doesn't affect the use at all."
5,"4,3,2, 1 ignition!","Fantastic. I used this in a portable heater that had given up igniting sometimes we had to push the original button 20 times or more before it lit, this one ignites the first push every-time! It was too small a diameter for the original hole, but fortunately I was able to get a C-clip that works as well as the original threading did, to hold it in the mount. I used the original spark rods. Now a huge blue spark jumps all the way across the burner. It originally arched a small yellow spark to the side of the burner.Absolutely fantastic fix! And inexpensive too.GrillPro 20610 Universal Fit Push Button Igniter for Gas Grills"
2,NEW FORMULA NOT GOOD,"I loved Atopalm. It was a rich fragrance free moisturizer that I could use on my entire body, including my face. The company changed the formulation in 2010, basically removing the parabens and adding fragrance. This made a huge difference to the efficacy of the product. It is no longer a rich emollient cream. It is now like many other drugstore moisturizers. And because my facial skin is very sensitive, the fragrance (although very subtle) STINGS my skin. I'll use the jar I have for my family (who it does not bother), but won't be buying again. Very disappointing."
5,Wonderful cream,This cream is wonderful. Had dry spots on my face tried everything and this took them all away. Will re order when I need more.
5,Great product!,"I bought this along with the eye repair serum to treat a severe case of dermatitis on my face and around my eyes. My skin was burning, red, swollen and scaly. After only two days using both products I had noticeable relief. Seven days later the condition is gone and my skin looks even better than before. I've never used anything that worked this well."
2,Expensive moisturizer,"My son has eczema. We saw this moisturizer having good review and hoped it could help. After 20 days trial, 3 times a day on affected area, we did not see significant improvement. It is just a good moisturizer but nothing special. 2.192.19 fl oz for $25! it is certainly not worth it. You can easily find an cheap alternative."
1,Do NOT order through Beauty Bridge!!,"The product might be wonderful, but the vendor responsible for shipping it (Beauty Bridge)is absolutely horrible. When my product never showed up, I had to make 2 separate calls to their customer service people before they would even investigate why. And both times, their representatives were extremely rude, and unapologetic."
3,No better than any other moisturizer,Tried ATOPALM on one elbow and a regular drugstore brand cream on the other after a month I didn't see any difference except my wallet was a little lighter. I can buy 3 of the cheaper creams and get the same benefit as if I spent three times as much. Not for me.
5,Bye-Bye Flakes!,"I received a sample of this from another online retailer awhile back and I love it! The Intensive Formula is really rich so I use it at night like a repair cream, then in the morning I use the regular MLE Face Cream. Atopalm is great not only for people with sensitive skin but for those with sensitive eyes. Usually fragrance is the culprit in skincare products that irritate my eyes but even fragrance free ones have made my eyes water. Atopalm hasn't made me shed a tear! Love this stuff!"
4,"Romeo Void - Never Say Never: Hits, Rarities and Gems","I really bought this looking for the 12"" single version of Never Say Never. I like their stuff, and found the dance mixes interesting as well."
3,Quirky New Wave,"Perhaps only for the nostalgic, or maybe those who love the 80s sound. Romeo Void - you have to admit it's a good name - were at least an interesting band whose signature sound was the unorthodox use of saxophone and lead singer Deborah's creamy, ennui-laden alto. My personal favourite is A Girl In Trouble, a great dance track which seems to give the finger to anti-abortionists."
5,teenage reader,I just finished an incredible book called Evan's Earthly Adventure. It's about the amazing life of a boy named Evan who was killed at the age of 13. His life was amazing. I don't know anyone that had a life like Evan's. It seemed that he had struggled to make his life perfect at the age of 13 by going through a rough stage where he was questioning everything and then he like found all the answers. I especialy liked the letters and emails from his friends.This book is very moving and helped me learn about life and death from a perspective that is helping me cope with my own life. I have never read a book that is so moving and filled with knowledge that is from a place that is healing and inspiring. There is a website ..... that has a lot of pictures of Evan and some excerpts from the book.I highly recommend this book to all teens looking for answers that your parents can't or won't tell you.
4,Excellent Story - needs more details,"There is an excellent story in this book. It is the true story of a boy named Evan, raised by unconventional parents, who grows up to be a compassionate, industrious young man. Admired by his peers as well as the adults in his life, Evan's talents, intelligence and honesty touch everyone in the small town where he lives.Evan's untimely death at thirteen alters the emotional landscape of the town of Groton."
1,I Bristle When I Use This Shaving Brush,This is absolutely the worse shaving brush I've ever used. I don't know what the bristles are made of but they are hard and harsh on the face and come out by the dozen. I won't use it for shaving. Save your money or invest it in a better shaving brush. This one is sheer junk.
4,Under the tree,"I too checked this out prior to putting this under the tree. Unlike the other reviewer I was amazed by the sound that came out of this. My husband kept telling me a premium sound system would sound great and this would sound terrible, when he heard it he was even impressed.I bought this for a 4 year old and 1 1/2 year old to share. The sound seemed good to me. Just be sure to order the 2nd microphone for $9.95 if you need it."
1,Doesnt LAST!!!,This was a present to my 5 yr old and it has broken 2x's with normal use. The microphone never worked right from the start!!!!
2,Not a quality product,"My husband and I bought this karaoke machine at ToysRUs for our 2 year old. Right out of the box the microphone didn't work when you plugged it into the left output. We tried it in the right one (there's two inputs in case you purchase the extra microphone)which worked fine. Daughter loves turning the echo up and singing as loud as she can. I was impressed with the volume and sound. My husband heard her singing from the basement! Anyway, the other day, she goes to sing and the microphone suddenly doesn't work. The machine hasn't moved from her nightstand so I'm not sure how it suddenly broke. She is heartbroken. For the price they charge for this item, it really should be of better quality...especially since it's designed for children. Now I have to find another microphone and hope that resolves the issue and not that the one functional input has broken. Wonder if Memorex will replace it?"
5,Great Step Workout,"I agree that the quality of the video is terrible and it's obviously a burned DVD, but you really work up a sweat even with the low impact option. It's very intense and learning the moves before attemping to do the routine is your best bet. This is the best step video that I have and the circuit challenge is my 2nd favorite."
5,Awesome,"My parents have had these dishes for more than 15 years. A few have broke, not nearly as many other sets i've had since i moved out. I like everything about them. They seem like they get more clean than other dishware. I could be crazy.I wish they sold service for 8 or 16. really just want the big ass plates. I know i can buy them individually but they cost a fortune comparatively.Anyway, if you've never owned a corelle dish, you are in for a treat!Aka:P"
5,Great everyday dishes,"My grandmother had been using these dishes for as long as I can remember, and when she died, they became mine. These dishes are lightweight but sturdy, and look just as good as the new set I just bought to expand my collection. Really great products."
4,Good and Durable,"So after my brand new Pfaltzgraff crapware chipped, crazed, and shattered within weeks of buying it, I went out and got some corelle frost. Now they aren't perfect...I had a few plates that did warp in the dishwasher, but I paid sooooo little for them vs the Pfaltzcrap and my kids can practically play frisbee with them and they don't break....I am okay with a few warped plates...nothing I can't get extras of. Very pleased with the durability."
4,overjoyed,"I bought this set of dishes for my daughter-in-law for Christmas.When she opened the box and saw the dishes, she was overly enthused.The dishes were packed well and everything was just great!!!! Iordered the dishes through Amazon.com which is a great web page toorder from."
2,3/4 made in USA and 1/3 made in China,"Would be five stars if everything was made in USA. Plates made in USA. BUT cups were made in China and not corelle, but STONEWARE.Well, I guess the chinese moved into Amazon. Sad, I thought they would be CORELLE made in USA. ? Maybe they were made in USA and to give them authenticity, inscribed -made in CHINA. Times are changing."
5,Pick this kit,"For folks deciding between this kit versusCorelle Livingware Winter Frost White 16-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4, pick this one because you can use the mugs to have hot drinks. The other set replaces the mugs with glass, which doesn't hold hot drinks well.I used to have the other set for several years until the movers dropped it, and then I replaced it with this set and realized the big difference. Hope you too!"
4,Great dishes,I love this set of dishes. The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because the plates were made in the USA and the mugs in China.
5,Great SET!!,This plates are awesome! They are very light and they occupy a small amount of space. Everyone in the house loves them!
1,Made in China Stoneware in the box,"If you want Corelle, don't buy this set. They've included four mugs that were Made in China of Stoneware. With two disabled parents, this was a huge disappointment as they can't lift stoneware. The box was also marked ""Made in USA"" in very large letters and Made in China was tiny. Not smart Corelle."
5,"Durable plates, nice, simple look","It's hard to beat Corelle for durability. I purchased this set a month ago to add to my collection of Corelle plates that I've had for 1 year and a half. The plates have been through quite a bit of use, and still have the same quality as when I bought them. No chips, breaks, or scratches."
4,Corelle dishes,I bought these for my daughter for Christmas. She tells me they are great and are exactly what she wanted.
4,Durable yet lightweight Corelle dishes.,"I bought these dishes because I was tired of chipped place settings. The Corelle sets are rather thin and light weight so you have to get used to them. My husband loves them. I like them but they are definitely not ceramic or porcelain in feel. They will be used only for everyday ware. I also find that food sticks to them a little more than ceramic ware, so you have to rinse quickly after eating. Overall, judging by other reviews they should last many many years."
4,Good quality yet with some imperfections,"In general, this set has great value which comes with decent quality products. Very easy to clean even with the usual hard to clean foods (spaghetti for example)However, i do find some imperfection on the edges of the plate (uneven surface when touched), which does not affect the use. Hopefully the manufacturer can pay attention to details and provide top notch quality products in the future!"
4,Corelle ware winter frost 16 pc set,"This set is nice, I bought 33 sets to use in our new 46 bed homeless shelter. I am surprised the mugs are thick and not the same as the bowls and plates. They sort of match, but not great and I think they are regular ceramic.Overall, it's what we wanted and Amazon sells it at a great price."
2,"Flimsy, poor quality.",The mugs that come with this set are sturdy and usable. But the plates and bowls are thin and flimsy. I'd be embarrassed to use them for visiting guests and cannot recommend them.
3,Not Your Mother's Corelle,"I recently bought five sets of Corelle Winter Frost White for the pending Thanksgiving feast. All I knew of Corelle was what I remembered as a kid from the 1970's, where my mom was an early devotee. While I would not pan the set completely, it certainly seemed thinner and flimsier than I remembered; indeed, one can see images through a dinner plate when held up to the light. That said, for less than $30.00 per set, I'm not sure one can expect more. Use 'em, break 'em, and toss 'em; if they last, great, if not, oh well. Just know what you are getting. Functional, and in the end, entirely forgettable...kind of a rich man's Chinette."
3,"This is not a porcelain set, it's made of glass!","Was expecting porcelain, but this stuff is made from glass and not very attractive. The description should do a better job of alerting the buyer that this is not a porcelain set."
2,Cheap = Cheap,These feel more like plastic than proper dinnerware. Think you might be better off taking a trip to Target.
1,dishes,"I was asked by amazon to rate this product.I really wish i could but since Amazon didnt use any packaging material in either box of plates i ordered, i recieved 2 nice and new boxes of shards.On top of that, when i returned them to amazon that very same day, i was hit with some sort of charge for something or other. Also, when i wrote to complain about the bill, it seems that they ""messed up"" and i got some minor additional funds back. It was the worste experience i have ever had with amazon and i have been a good customer for several years.So i cant really rate the plates but they looked nice in the pictures."
3,Got one defective bowl,I was a bit disappointed when I noticed that one of the four bowls was defective. The other issue with the set is the coffee mugs are made of stoneware which was not expected. It did not seem worth it to return the entire set so I decided to keep it.
4,Does the job,Durable dinnerware. Lightweight dishes and bowls. Heavier mugs. I would recommend this to couples or individuals who cook casually. This is not really dinnerware for large family gatherings or special holidays.
1,Not shatter proof!,"My elderly father who lives with me is the reason I bought these dishes. This set was promoted on HSN as ""unbreakable."" Demo kept dropping the dish and showing that they did not break. Well my dad dropped a dish and it shattered into hundreds of little pieces. I have never had a dish shatter this way before and I am so disappointed with Corelle. I am looking for a nice melamine set. In fact, I was looking for a plastic set when I happened on the HSN when they were selling this Corelle set. If you are buying this set for the ""unbreakable-chip free"" qualities, don't buy it! If you just want a reasonably priced, nice looking, space saving dinner set and you don't have the ""dropsies"" - then buy it."
2,bowls are small,"i've never been impressed with any of corelle's designs so i purchased this one, the only other thing i don't like about this product it that the bowl is really small it's almost as small as my toddlers bowl, my family rarely uses them instead we purchased the corelle fun packs which thankfully matches this set"
5,Works as advertised,"This self-stick protective cover is quite thick and substantial, yet applies easily and stays put. Obviously will protect the glass lens from many a rock strike."
5,How to Begin the Christian Life,This product is being used as a tool for new members class. It has proven to not only be beneficial to new converts but those persons who want to renew their commitment to Christ. The book is excellent.
1,Not very good..,"I always hate doing this to my own brethren but I just can't recomend this poor outline. Read, 'A Compact Guide To The Christian Life' by Karen Lee-Thorp, it's much better."
1,Waste of money,"If you have a Compaq forget it. The card does not like to share IRQ addresses. The ""boy"" that works the support line has no clue. Only answer is ""this happens with Compaqs""."
1,A device attached to the system is not functioning,"If you like self torture get one of these. I play musical PCI slots to get it to work sometimes. It is easy to use when it works. There is nooooo customer support, they've never answered any of my emails. Is there a lemon law for computer hardware? The people at Dazzle should be sued for malpractice and mental torture!"
1,Don't lose your receipt for product.,"I would recommend that you quickly repackage this product if you purchased it and return it before the warrantee expires. I made the mistake of purchasing this product last year and have never been able to make it work correctly. I tried to install it on a 450 Mhz Dell and a 1.6 Mhz Dell w/ Windows XP. I couldn't even get it to start up or install correctly on the windows XP. On the 450 Mhz machine I was able to install it and actually load some video into the program using the interface. However, I was never able to get it to successfully edit the imported video. The downloads for Dazzle says it all. It never has worked well if at all with Windows XP. ... Try Pinnacle or anything else."
1,Be Careful!,"Be careful with these so-called new cartridges. I ordered the HP53A from rafa2207 for $54.00 in May of this year. It was advertised as NEW. I'm using it now, and I'm getting repeat images or ""ghosts"" on all of my copies. The cartridge is repeating about two lines of type on every copy. So much for cheaper pricing!"
5,HP Always comes through,"I just got the new HP printer, then purchased this new toner cartridge.I have not used it yet, but I have NEVER had a problem with a toner cartridge manufactured by HP, and that includes three HP printers"
4,Center,Arived fast. Better built Than I expected I am going to have to re taper it to a o mt before I can test it.
4,"A ballet of love, marriage and fidelity","Written in luminous, almost poetical prose and set against the glamour of the New York City Ballet, Yona Zeldis McDonough's debut novel THE FOUR TEMPERAMENTS is an exotic and alluring story that examines how modern day love, marriage and fidelity are tested.Alternating forward and backward in time, THE FOUR TEMPERAMENTS is the story of the love triangle between Oscar Kornblatt, his son Gabriel and Ginny Valentine, the young, brazen dancer who changes both their lives forever.Captivating and intensely emotional, THE FOUR TEMPERAMENTS is an impressive debut."
1,Not a Martin,"Horrible guitar. It's already been to the shop once for warranty work (to file down the fret ends and fix the neck), and now it has developed three new cracks on the spruce top. While inspecting the damage, I discovered the the side and back are covered in a wood veneer, just like the crap furniture you buy at walmart. Oh it's made in Mexico, not Nazareth, PA. Well, that what you get for buying cheap! Oh, $1,000.00 MSRP is cheap? Sorry, Martin, you're brand is in the toilet - I'll never buy a Martin again."
2,Nice but???,I puchased the Sharp and found it easy to use but disapointing in low light and indoor situations with slow auto focus and color shifting. I finally replaced it with a Sony TRV66 which is quite a bit more expensive but performs much better all round.
1,Disaster,This company never shipped my item after over one month of waiting & wondering and never responded to my questions.Amazon refunded my money thirty something days after this disaster. Don't buy anything from DVD Legacy.
5,LOVE IT!!!,Beautifully written. Beautifully illustrated. This is a wonderful story and the kids (ages 7 and 3) were enthralled. It is a science book that reads like the best kind of picture book. We learned so many things from this and had fun doing it. Very highly recommended.
2,Dresses 40 (micro-machines) Tires! LOL!,"I love how the ad on the box and the Amazon page says ""dresses up to 40 tires."" They're right - if your tires are an inch or two in diameter, it will.I have three cars, real ones - a VW Rabbit, a BMW 325i, and a Toyota Prius, and it barely did all 12 tires in total before the bottle went dry.Decent product, lasts for a decent time I suppose - but bad value at any price above 2$ (I paid 2.34$ or something here at Amazon, shipped free via Prime)"
3,"Good product, mediocre packaging...","This product is satisfactory, but no better or worse than any other tire gel. The difficulty comes in the packaging. The built-in applicator makes it hard to get to the bottom of the tire and the gap where it meets the wheel. This could be easily accomplished with a seperate sponge. Secondly, the top snaps into place but fits loosely and leaks after a short time. Again, I like the product but would stick with a traditional bottle and applicator sponge."
3,It's okay,When I bought my toshiba laptop..extra batteries costs a fortune...now that it's two years old and my original battery would only run for 15minutes fully charged I decided to get a spare unit which now costs cheaper. I wish toshiba makes a longer lasting battery because it's just zapping the power out very quickly.
2,no customer support,"I wasn't too disappointed at first. I had some problems with the video feed being choppy, but I think that may have been a processor problem. It comes with a DVD which contains additional content which you can access only after you register (send them your personal information). If you don't have a DVD drive, then you can order the content on CDs. When the URL for ordering the CDs turned out to be dead, I tried to contact customer support. Alas, you can't email them and can't call them on the phone. If your question isn't in their Q&A list, then don't expect and answer. This product is going back to the store."
1,How bad it could get...,I bought the Video Creator 80 a few days ago and only had troubles. After getting the program finally to run (you will need to update all software and look for patches to make the software recognizing your DVD drive) I was able to convert a video from a VCR. It takes forever to convert an AVI file to a MPEG and you will need a BID hard drive to store the temp files. The quality of the end product is just LOSY. I don't know what they mean with Hollywood quality. Hollywood movies might be awful enough but cannot be toped if they are burned with the Video Creator 80. Keep your hands off and invest a few dollars more to buy a good product (e.g. Avermedia).
1,one too many stars,"This product is a rip-off.1. No user manual in the box.2. No software name included so good luck finding it once you install it.3. Horrible quality using Win XP Home, tried Windows Movie Maker and the included Videowave. Neither played back anything complete or even fairly passable even after I tried all the ""improvements"" on the website.4.Customer support is $15.95 or sit and wait for at least an hour on a toll call. 6 of 1 and half a dozen of the other. They get you either way.5.This product is completely mis-represented. Yes you could probably make a cake using dirt, but who would eat it?6.Don't waste your money. I spent a lot of time trying to make this product work as it should, I am technically capable and have experience using lots of workable programs. As I have read in other reviews people seem to be jumping through hoops to get results."
3,Great Little Capturing Device,"I've had this product for six months and had no problems. Dazzle 80 works great as a small capturing device. The only drawback I have found it does not capture in anything larger than 350 by 288. So if you expect this product to render quality DVD's it does not. The software included has some drawbacks but I have used the text animator, capturing though, there are other products out there such as Virtual Dub or Unlead Movie Studio that are free or work better."
1,Dazzle video creator 80,"SirThe software that came with the capture device is not any good for recording anything over 16 min. You cannot capture a full lenghth movie with this product. My hard drive has about 94 hours of storage space on it. The reason that I bought this product, was to be able to convert my vhs movies to cd/dvds, but this product can't record that long of a movie. The soft ware program that came with it is MGI VIDEO WAVE 4 THIS IS NO GOOD FOR ANY THING. IT STOPS AT 16 MIN AND GIVES AN ERROR MESSAGE THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH DISK SPACE. I'AM USING A 60 GIG HARD DRIVE."
2,Repetition...,This book has good content but lost me due to its constant repetition of the same information or thoughts. It's about an unwavering loyalty and obedience to authority.
1,Need the book first,"I am unable to review this book because I have not received it yet. It's been almost been 3 weeks. I've been told that it was delivered but I have yet to see it. Once I receive it, if ever, I will be glad to review it."
1,"Dangerous, be very careful","John Bevere teaches that one should submit to authority of all kinds and that by doing so one is protected by God, even IF/WHEN the authority has made a mistake. This is not true, at least not true most of the time. This can actually lead to spiritual or marriage abuse and the person being abused will believe they are the ones in error! So I would have to say that this teaching is dangerous, especially if taken alone without any sort of balance. If you insist on reading this book, then read others on spiritual abuse and how it can happen.I pray that Bevere repents of his teaching."
1,Charismatic Hyper-authoritarianism,"This is probably the most harmful thing that has personally ever happened to me and my family. It gives dominating, abusive, pastor leaders a license to practice destructive and damaging behavior by manipulating God's people thru guilt and intimidation - coercing them into whatever the pastor wants to do. I'm sure the author never intended that - but that has been my experience. If you walk in the front door of a church and find this book has front and center of any display - run as fast as you can out the door."
5,Divinely Awesome,"Reading this book has enlighten myself and others who I study with about being submissive and obedient to delegated authority (even when we don't agree) because when we follow those who are in authority, we are ultimately being obedient to God."
5,Has God Forgotten?,"For thos who have problems with authority, this is the book you need to read. If you believe God has a purpose for your life, then you need to understand how submission to authority can bless you righ out of your socks. We like to omit cruel, unfeeling people and people who mistreat us from God's Plan; not so. God knows our situation and will act on our brhalf. We have to remain faithful, trust Him for the final outcome and not forget to pray for these people (I have seen the lives of many who abused a Believer, shortened; others suffered serious injury).This book gives you something to think and pray about. I personally had a 30-year question answered and confirmed."
5,Excellent Book,John Bevere really has a way of getting to the root and helping you to work through past problems while having you correct current ones by staying under authority.
2,Under Cover,"The church I used to be a part of pushed this book on me. I read a little of it and threw it in the trash. The doctrine in this book has no scriptural basis to exist. This covering doctrine is used by pastors to control people. To quote Frank Viola in his book,""Whos your covering"" which I highly recommend, ""When someone ask you, ""Who is your covering""? In essence what they are asking is who controls you. I am reminded of Colossians 2:8: Be careful that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit based on human tradition and not based on Christ."" And Matthew 15:9: ""They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men"".Dont buy this book and further more run from any ministry who pushes this doctrine. It will only put you in bondage. Take the 10 bucks instead and give it to someone in need."
5,Oh Boy Am I Gonna Get Bashed,"Alright. Something I will never understnad is why people who hate Eminem must insist on writing negative reviews as if they are going to convince fans. Look, just because you rate an album one or two stars, doesn't mean that you are magically going to change someone's opinion about music. The whole point of reviewing is to provide someone else who has similar interests to see if the CD is worthwhile. That being said, I'm sure that anyone browsing this CD already owns some of Eminem's previous CDs or has heard his songs on the radio. This is a greatest hits package, so every song that was on the radio or talked about in the media is on here. New songs are included as well, like ""When I'm Gone"", which is a great song. If you are a casual fan and dont want to buy every album and end up with a lot of filler, this is a good buy. Sure it's not ground-breaking hip-hop or even really ""music"", but its fun and different. Thank You..."
4,can be better,"In my opinion this cd features some of eminem's greatest hitsHowever, it can be better.I say take out fack and shake that because they suckreplace them with some better songssuch as white america,soldier,etc.overall though I still like this cd"
3,"Good, but could've been much better","Curtain Call - The Hits, is not a ""best of"" Eminem album, it is basically every Eminem single from his four cds made into a compilation with a few new songs for incentive to buy. The single for the album, ""When I'm Gone"", is a deep song depicting the troubles of neglecting family while trying to maintain status in the music industry. This song is written in famous Eminem fashion, great lyrics, including dialogue between himself and his daughter. The other two new tracks, ""FACK"" and ""Shake That"", do not belong on a greatest hits album because they are at best mediocre songs. The former is an immature tale of..well you will have to hear it to believe it. If you are a fan of Eminem based on what you have heard on pop radio, this CD is right for you. If you appreciate the artform of hip-hop, then perhaps you should pass on this money making excuse for Interscope until a true ""best of"" album is released showcasing Mr. Mathers complete talents."
3,Pretty good...,"I bought this cd... and got what i paid for.I am a 15 year old boy.. so naturally i like rap. Or so i'm stereotyped. Well... I'm actually a country kid, but i did enjoy some of this cd.There were songs that i love of his on here (The Way I am, Mockinbird, Lose Yourself.) But there was some songs that i thought were VERY innapropriate.. (but i really cant say anything.. i knew what i was buying)But overall i thought it was a fantastic cd"
2,"Eminem - rub a dub, dub, SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",This is a great album but everyone has heard these songs over and over again.
2,Uhhhhhhhh....,"I like Eminem as an artist but alot of these hits are so played out or suck. If I wanted to listen to those songs, id just grab the CD and listen to the other songs if I wanted to listen to them too.Shake That is more like a Nate Dogg track.Fack is the worse song EVER. Just Lose It is actually good compared to this. And people think this is funny? Psssh smh @ Eminem di*kriders. Ish aint funny, its retarded and disgusting...what is he on drugs? Nobody wants to hear about a gerbil in their ass.When Im Gone is my favorite Eminem song. Those emotional songs are the truth."
1,"Sorry Fat Joe, needs to be said!","The Kracker has a flow like an 18 year old Peurto Rican Chick! What's wrong with all of you?""Man Dre does his beats man, thats some kosher ----!""---- that ----! If it were'nt for Dre no one would have ever heard of this punk! You want a White Detroit rapper with a good flow, check out Jamie Maddrox! You want to hear a Peurto Rican Chick rap, go to Fullerton Street in Chicago!"
1,same old songs,"nothing new offeredwhat a waste of time and moneyEm needs to grow up or make good music again, because right now he is just doing neither."
1,Em-is-done! STALE ALBUM!!!,"When I 1st heard Em was putting together a greatest hits CD, it solidified the truth of him retiring. I thought this guy would go out with a bang... I WAS WRONG, the songs picked for this album where poorly choosen and arranged. FACK is just completely ridiculous! Since ""Encore"" Eminem has been rapping about NOTHING over semi hot DRE tracks. Why do we give him so much credit? It boggles my mind! Do not buy this CD if you are a fan of Eminem, cause you won't be once your done listening."
3,hope he od's,eminem's cool but never was a serious fan if you're a serious fan I recommend this while taking prescription drugs and other narcotics so you'll enjoy it better enjoy.
3,Not great enough,"Where's Haille's song? Where's 8 Mile road? What is 'Fack' and 'Shake it' doing on the CD? Why is it only 17 tracks long? Eminem is undoubtedly one of the most successful and greatest emcees, but this is no great 'greatest hits' CD.So if I were you, i'll download all my favorite eminem tracks and put them onto a CD of my own. No point wasting your money on this incomplete greatest hits CD.cheers"
5,"Oh, yes!","Eminem is the baddest and toughest dude in hip hop right now. I 100% respect him and his art. You better not mess with him, or he'll cut you down to size. Give him his due and buy this disc."
5,Em's Greatest Hits,"This is a greatest hits cd from eminem that i love. it has mostly the best songs from albums: the slim shady lp, the marshall mathers lp, the eminem show, encore, the 8 mile soundtrack, and 3 new songs as well. a great cd full of good songs as well as what could be perhaps the final bow of eminem."
3,hope this isnt em's last,"i m a huge fan of eminem and i like his music.......the hits are great but i'll write this review on the basis of his 3 new trackswhen i am gone - 10/10 - great trackshake that feat nate dogg - 5/10 - mediocre track...more like a nate dogg songfack - 0/10 - i hate this track...seriouslyso overall, maybe 3.5 stars"
5,Greatest hits album worth buying,"Curtain call is a very good greatest hits album by a very good rapper named Eminem. If you enjoy his singles as they are played on the airways then this cd will be perfect for you to enjoy time and time again. I enjoy the bonus songs called When I'm gone, and Stan with his performance from the grammy's with Elton John. I will continue to enjoy Eminem's music and keep buying his albums. Some greatest hits albums come off as strained or pushed but they did a great job on cd and it trully has his every hit on this album."
4,Love it!,"This item was purchased for my husband to go along with the new woofer system as I usually don't listen to this kind of music. I'm more of a Korn and Disturbed kind of person. However, after listening to this CD, I cannot get enough of it.What I love about Eminem's style is his honesty about his life in many of his lyrics instead of the typical ""gangsta"" lyrics.Though some of his songs are quite comical(FRACK) - Marshall does have a very serious and apparently caring side of him that comes out in songs like Mockingbird.All I can say is he's got a new fan!"
5,The Tarantino of the Music World.,"If you thought that owning an entire Eminem album collection just to hear those great tunes might be outside of your financial scope for appreciating hip hop, then this is exactly what you want, the Eminem Greastist Hits collection. This is a perfect item for anyone who wants to have some of the best of hip hop on their shelf without spending a fortune. This is a A+ hip hop album, even for those who don't like hip hop, can appreicate the fact that Eminem worked out some wonderful tunes that are hard to forget once you have heard them. You can't dog just how good he is. The Eminem Collection - Just what the average Joe needs."
4,Everybody poops is a humorous and educational experience,"For young children, this book is a great resource towards their learning about, well.... poop. As a child psychologist, I realize that only through teaching youngsters about such a socially inappropriate topic will they stop joking about it during class, lunch and at home."
1,"How is this a ""best of""?","i am a huge eminem fan and the tracks on this cd do not represent his best work at all. the only thing on this cd is a couple new songs and all his other ""hits"". where's criminal? where's role model? where's still dont give a f*ck? where's kill you? where's drug ballad? if you only know eminem by his popular songs and thats all you like then this is a perfect album, but if your looking for his best songs then gather all these songs and put them on a cd-1. My Name Is - (slim shady)2. Guilty Conscience3. '97 Bonnie & Clyde4. Role Model5. Bad Meets Evil6. Just Don't Give A F*ck7. Still Don't Give A F*ck8. Kill You - (marshal mathers)9. The Way I Am10. Drug Ballad11. Kim - a real messed up song but there is so much emotion in the song12. Criminal13. Soldier - (eminem show)14. 'Till I Collapse15. Square Dance16. Cleanin Out My Closet17. Evil Deeds - (encore)18. Yellow Brick Road19. Like Toy Soldiers"
3,Way to many songs missed,i would much rather own one his other albums than this one. there are so many good songs he missed.Eminem lp-Rock BottomSlim Shady lpKill YoukimEminem ShowWhite americaSoldierSay Goodbye HollyWoodHalies SongTil i Collapseall the songs that were decent off of his newest album were on this album so i didnt list it. all these songs i listed should of been on that greatest hits album. why choose mocking bird over hailies song? another thing that bothers me is that eminem would put out a greatest hits album anyway. i just don't know what to think
4,"A pretty good album, whether you like him or not","This album is not bad at all. I was suprised to see people rate it 1 or 2 stars. But I guess it's understandable, since some of these people don't even know how to spell ""controversy"" (hint: press control + f and search for ""contreversy""). THe only reason why I'm giving 4 stars is because not all the new songs are that great. But When I'm Gone is just so damn good. Eminem definately has some of his old sparks left in him. Well done."
5,Historic HipHop Artist,"I don't care what anyone says, Em will most likely go down as the most influential hiphop artist of our time.And I don't care what you say, ""When I'm Gone"" is worth every penny you spend on this CD. It's one of the best songs I've ever heard. Gives me goosebumps everytime I listen to it."
1,Isn't this guy dead yet?,"Ok, so the Vanilla Ice rip off artist has a greatest hits cd out. Who cares? How many cd's does he have out anyway? 2? 3? And he already has greatest hits? Um, ok. So, in those 2 or 3 prior cd's, after he b*tches and moans like a whiny schoolgirl nancyboy about his bothersome ex-wife, now he's back with her. He's worse than little girl. He needs to actually grow a pair, as well as backbone, realize he is talent-less, and do the world a favor, as well as his so-called daughter, and just stick a .45 in his mouth and put an end to it. Or, I guess to be rap enough, it'd be a ""glock."" Whatever, just do his civic duty and end it already. Out. Semper Fi."
1,Same old rant,"I used to like Em, now I've just outgrown him. This CD is just one more hate-filled garble. Same old stuff, nothing new. After hearing this, it becomes obvious: Em is done, washed up, over. Another CD from a middle-aged man that acts like a rebellious teen. Sad, but true."
1,Lets Hope Its The Final Bow,his first 2 were his best then he fell off..this is an alright collection of his greatest hits but it shoul have been a double disc...eminem has fell off...the only reason he gets 1 star is cause of the couple songs that are good...about 3 or 4 of them....otherwise its not too good...its more of a radio hits cd then a greatest hits cd...if there is more after this then lets hope this is the final bow
3,Good bye Em,"When I first heard Eminem, I was immature. Thats probably why I dug his first two cds. The Marshal Mathers LP is probably one of the finest rap cds out there. He grew up, started to mature, and so did I. The way that I am was is a good song, but he basically made every single song after that a sappy song. Unless it was his first single off the cd and it was a generic copy of the last first single he did. I boycotted Eminem for about a year now, due to his disappointing last cd. Plus he is running low on ideas. I understand he's older and a dad, so maybe he'll go away for awhile and raise Haley. His new song is alright, although its sappy. Thanks Em for the great music, take a nice, long vaction."
3,Eminem's Greatest Hits Package Misses,"Since entering the mainstream rap and pop music market, Eminem has shocked and amazed many and also left behind many memorable songs. A decent amount of some of his best work in addition to some new songs were scraped together for this greatest hits package, ""Curtain Call"". The selection of songs include two of Eminem's biggest hits, ""My Name Is"" and ""Lose Yourself"". However, some key songs such as ""'Till I Collapse"", ""Criminal"", and ""Role Model"" are missing. If this is Eminem's last release, then I am happy because I believe that he has went as far as possible with his lyrical and musical creativity. If you want a true Eminem greatest hits package, you're better off burning yourself a CD with all of his real hits on it instead of buying this poorly thrown together compilation."
5,A reflective perspective played thru the harp,"Michael Deep performs a very reflective, personal album; with his self-adapted electro-acustic harp he weaves an emotional web that seems to be spun from experiences and episodes in his life. ""Those Eyes"" starts out as a haunting movement but quickly moves to relaxing trek. ""Benny's Song"" is an instrumental ode to his dearly departed brother and is hub of the album being the longest track on the cd. ""Night Flight"" literally takes you on a gentle flight thru the night sky and toward the end, to a surreal plane. This is a definate ""buy it"" especially if you enjoy listening to those ""Relaxing"" cds. Michael Deep certainly relaxes you, but he also offers you an entertaining peppy performance."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Holden Carver is a secret agent, he just happens to be a super powered one. He is sent to infiltrate an organisation whose top hierarchy is also super powered, and quite nasty. When Carver's boss and handler is injured and left comatose he has noone to turn to, and must attempt to make the best of the dangerous situation he is left in."
3,right,"this was the right part with the right fit and arrived promptly. What else can you write about a Front upper control arm? It looks sturdy, durable and still works to this day"
4,A good book,I recommend this well written book for all that want to understand Karate in a way that aproximate its original form.
4,A Master's View of His Martial Art,"Sensei Nagamine shares his heart, as well as his art, in this excellent book. The history of the martial arts development as well as its forms and function are presented in an easy-to-read format. For those who are students of the martial arts, especially Shorin-Ryu, this is an insight into the mindset of one of Okinawa's greatest teachers. It is a ""must have"" for the traditional student who wants to preserve the original kata forms and legacy of Grandmaste Nagamine."
3,Good but there are problems.,"The first part of the book, including history and basic techniques, is great; however, the reason one buys the book is to learn the katas. It is a great book considering you get all the Matsubayashi Shorin-Ryu katas for such a low price, but it is very difficult to follow the pictures that illustrate the movements of any given kata. For instance, Chinto is very difficult to learn from the book, I find. The pictures often do not show the moves when Shoshin Nagamine's back is to the reader. And even though foot-prints are used to show the direction in which one should move, they get a bit difficult to understand at times.This is perhaps a great book for students of Shorin-Ryu, but only a good book for everyone else."
5,Perfect,"This book is a great work, I served as instructive in my preparation, I recommend this treatise to all who study and practice martial arts."
4,One of the best of its kind,"This is an excellent first look at the shorin-ryu styles whose lineages originate with Kian Chotoku, one of the Okinawan karate greats. There is generally good coverage of the kata, although there could be more description immediately with the photographs. Certainly, this is one of the best books of it's kind available and there should be more like it. I was a little surprised that the book had so little history (only a few pages). For a direct student of Kian Chotoku, history should be the strongest part of the book"
5,punk is not dead,punk is not dead!.. this CD is the bomb!.. music is great.. and so are the lyrics... I'll be lookin' for this band.....and their next CD...!!
3,"A Good, Simple Game","Silent Steel strikes me as a good mix between a movie and a game. If you are into real gaming, look somewhere else. This is strictly a movie with several branches. You make the decisions, then watch what happens... There are some trouble with the choice screen when you try to fast forward some scenes (word of advice: don't) and the save and restore feature is an anoyingly slow process. Also,even if there is mention of ""Crimson Tides"" and other good movies, don't expect high quality computer animation. The real-live footage are excellent, however, and the acting is above average. A good game for the casual person."
4,Great Stuff,"""Home"" is the first release for Versus The Mirror, and in my opinion, its great. The screaming is somewhat airy, and may be just a little bit hard to understand at first, but after a while, you get used to it. Their whole sound as a whole reminds me of As Cities Burn for some reason that i just cant pick out...it may be the sound of the screaming.Well anyways, try out Versus The Mirror if your interested in Hardcore with a different sound.Standout tracks in my opinion include: Life As A Criminal, Out Of Context, Boy Gets What He Wants, and (I Am) The Master Of Gravity"
5,Redemption after suffering addiction and loss,"I,like others who have read this book, could not put the book down. What reads like fiction, is a real life account of one man's journey through the valley of addiction and loss. It is very inspirational and a must read for those looking for answers for the way out. I highly recommend giving this a read."
4,cultural history of T'ang China,"This is not a biography of the Buddha. It is a cultural and intellectual history of China's T'ang period focusing on its Buddhist heritage, art, customs, and principle sites. Somewhat out of date in terms of research, as it was written during the 1920's, but still quite fascinating."
3,Biography?,A biography of Buddha supposedly written by an disciple. Translated from a French version of the 1929 book. Not particularly fascinating. It was written in a `he went there and did this' kind of style. A bit of a struggle to read at times. Following a bit too close in his footsteps.
3,Deanna lies and attracts thhe most honest man in New York!,"To escape a philandering millionaire, Deanna tells him that her husband is very jealous. The only trouble is, she isn't married! Tom Drake plays thhe supposed husband and is not very happy to find out she lied about him. The movie is delightful, not to mention funny. It is one of our favorite Durbin films."
4,I'll Be Yours,"The movie is fairly good and entertaining, especially if you enjoy Durbin's singing. I personally prefer the movies that were filmed when Durbin was a youngster, I think her acting was much better."
4,Must Have for the GBA!,"Even if you aren't a mario fan, the game is a must have for any game boy game collection. The game does get hard, but if you keep at it you will eventually get it. Extremely good graphics (for a game boy, that is) and never seems to get ""old."" Great game, if not a tad bit hard."
4,REALLY COOL REMAKE!!!,"If you liked super nintendo, then super mario world is a must-have. It is a remake of the classic snes game, it's portable(duh) is a bit easier to tell u the truth but it's still just as fun!!!!"
4,"This is a challenging, strategy-packed game","This game is really fun. You have to think a lot about it and it can get frustrating. When i first got it, I zipped through the first world and had a lot of fun. But as the worlds went on, I had to think more, strategize more, and play more. I went on a long car trip so I got a lot of time to play it. So far, I've played it about 70 hours and I'm only on world 3. But this game is very fun and you can go back to levels and try out cheats and get items that you didn't have a chance to get. The only thing about this game is a little discouraging is the fact that you will get sick of playing the levels. But you get unlimited continues and the only thing you lose are points. Buy this game, and at first you'll think it's easy, then you'll think it's cheap (like me), then you'll think ""I really like this game."""
4,Dad's Review,"I know nothing about this game except that my kids cannot stop playing it. I have to take it away. I've bought several game boy games for them but they only want to play with this one. For kids ages 6-9, it is easy for them to just start playing without knowing anything or reading instructions. Some Game Boy games require you to be a kid prodigy. Not this one. It's easy and extremely fun and keeps them quiet for hours. For that reason, I love it."
4,Its Okay,"I wouldn't say that Super Mario World is the best, but its okay. When you can't beat a level though,it gets kind of boring after trying for a very long time. And sometimes the music is so irritating."
4,Great Game,"This is a good game once you get the hang of it. You'll be frustrated at first but keep playing, it gets better."
4,I loved this game for SNES,"This game is the...stuff. The only drawback are the annoying sounds that mario says when he jumps. I gave this 4 stars because it is an existing game, I'm waiting for an original mario for the advance. I also would like to see Mario 3 (which, in my mind, is the best platformer, if not the best game ever) and Mario RPG, if possible."
4,SM3 instead.,"I love this game but there is one problem. Why not Super Mario 3? In Super Mario Brothers Deluxe they had SMB and The Lost Levels. In Super Mario Advance(1)they had Super Mario 2, and now in Super Mario Advance2: Super Mario World they just skip to Super Mario World. This is my favorite game of all time but I still like Super Mario Bros. 3. One more thing( i know I sound like ""Uncle"" from Jackie Chan Adventures but who cares)Why did they add Classic Mario again? Taht is Lameo."
5,this is the a great game,this is an awsome game i highly recomend this game to all you gamers out there. im not sucking up to mario or any thing like that. its just 100% pure sweetness. these days its hard to find game this good. useally its just junk like jimmy nutron and the wild thorn berrys. just get this game and thats the bottom line. THIS HAS BEEN A MATT GAMING REVEIW
4,One word-Unrealistic,"The begining of this game is really fun and exiting. But when you get to Chocolate Island/Special in Star World, you start to wonder if the things in the game could happen in real life. I'm not talking about stuff like if you eat a mushroom you become really big. I'm talking about stuff like if you touch the back of a baseball player you get hurt. In Super Mario World you do! Otherwise this game is fun and I highly recomend it."
3,"Fun, fun, fun, now improve the graphics!","The Mario games are always fun, and this one is no exception. The level designs excel even more this time with flexible routes. There's a lot of action that will please both kids and adult gamers. Mario's positive attitude just keeps the game such a pleasant experience! :)Now, why can't they improve the graphics? The colors are too bland and the characters too fuzzy. GBA can do better than this. I look forward to improved texture rendering in the next appearance by Mario and friends."
4,their all the same,"almost all mario games are pretty much the same, junp on people, eat mushrooms, go down tubes, etc. get it if your a die-hard fan fo mario games, if your not, well, youll get bored REALLY fast!!!"
3,..Well,"I really cant tell you if this is just great or bad. Mario games are fun but to tell you the truth just,getting to old for this.-Pros-1-Great gameplay and great for shutting up ya kids.if ya have any.2-Lots of levels so it will be long and entertaining.3-Tatics needed a little a bit. Need to grow ur mind dude.-Cons-1.Dont ya ever get tired of jumping on things.2.Ya might play to much.Try to look at ur self in the mirror if you have the second.3.Portalble games are bad To small and kinda gets you dizzy.4.PLAY AS A FRENCH,ITALIAN MULTICULTURAL IDIOT or idiots.Luigi.-Suggesting-Try to make kids play it.Not urself."
1,Super Stupid World,"This game is none other than horrible. The music is bad, the grapics are dispicable. You only get one life when you start of and thee are so many glitches that make you die. Just do you money a favor, tell it to be patient and don't buy this terrible game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,If you think the game is easy...you haven't completed it,"This is a great game. The graphics could be a little better, but other than that the game will keep your attention. The game is farley easy to beat if you go from level 1 to 7. But if you are a hardcore gamer like me, there are so many secret areas in this game. To get all of them with the yoshi coins in each level is tough. I give the game 4 stars instead of 5 because when you are throught with the game, there is nothing else to do. There is a multiplayer game like in Super mario 2 advance, but that is it. I recomend renting it, before you buy it."
5,Marios at his best!,"In this game, Mario and Luigi come to an island with princess peachs sister, Toadstool. Bowser, the koopa king, kidnaps her and you have to save her from him. You have to fight his assistant koopas first. They are Iggy, Lemmy, ludwig, Roy, Wendy O. you have to go through their castles, as well as levels to get to Bowsers palace. yoshi can help you. you cannot be hurt on Yoshi but if touched you will fall off and he will try to run away. OOF!"
4,fun game,"This is a very fun game with many chalenging levels. You can play the mario arcade game, super mario world, or battle a friend. In super mario world you must travel throughout the island and defeat koopa's kids and eventually koopa himself. Some of the levels can be very difficult though. You can play as mario or luigi and of course throughout the levels you will find yoshi which can be found in four differnt colors each with different powers. This is a fun game that will have you playing for hours. I still haven't beat it yet. Happy gaming."
5,The 1990's classic SNES game is in the palm of your hands,"Game boy color is fun because it's like the original nintendo only much smaller, but game boy advance is even better because it's like a smaller version of 1990's Super Nintendo and one of the hottest games for it then was SUPER MARIO WORLD.I used to play this on super nintendo when I was a little kid and boy it was fun and still is. I bought this during memoriable day weekened and sure it was only a week till all I had to do was beat Bowser but I got through it so quikly because I remembered alot stuff in it. Alot of old characters had come back to memory, and so did alot of stages and levels. The game at first is easy but will get more challenging the further you. Believe me, this is a good game to buy."
4,Super Mario 2 for the GBA,"Personally I would've preferred this game in its original format, but this is still fun to play. Any old-school gamer would get a sense of nostalgia just playing this remake, and some of the added features make this game more fun than the original."
5,"This game rocks, for snes, but what about GBA?","I have this game, for the snes, and since I love it so much, I ordered it for the GBA. I havent gotten it yet, but I dont doubt that Nintendo is capible of transfering this awsome game from SNES to GBA. If this game is exactly like the SNES version, than I will be very happy. The reason this game is good is because, it has so many levels init that this game, never gets boring. It is a bit of a chalenge to get all 96 levels, but its not completly impossible, like some games, which is good. I am very happy this game is out for the GBA, but I also hope that super mario bros 3 comes out soon too, because that would be a good game too, because of some of the same reasons as super mario world, like lots of levels. Well I cant wait till I get this game. Well if you have a GBA, I hope you get this game, I think it will be the best GBA game ever!"
5,SNES memories.,"I was one of the unfortunate that never owned an SNES, my parents were of the belief that ""You already have a Nintendo AND an Atari, you don't need another one."" So while my friends were playing great games like Super Mario World, Secret of Mana, Breath of Fire, and Final Fantasy VI, I was stuck with Duck Hunt. Now most of that has changed, with the GBA I can actually play all of those games I never got the chance to... except the Square games *sniff* but maybe someone besides Nintendo will be out with a handheld system and bring me my Secret of Mana & FF classics fixes (hope of all hopes!)."
4,a hard game.,It's fun in the begining .But the levels get harder and game play is not as fun .It got so hard it was not much fun to play.and has not much varity in it.
4,A must have for GBA owners!,This is a classic game and I'm glad it was re-released on GBAformat for a new generation of gamers to highlight the amount ofcluttering [junk] called games that flood the market. GBA ownersgo out and buy this game! A must for your collection!
4,Very Fun Game,"I got this game with my GBA on Christmas. It is alot of fun to play. So far, this game is the best GBA game ever!!!!"
4,Who could go wrong with Mario!,"Another Mario Masterpiece is with us! This game is amazing and doesn't let you down. With about 100 levels and hidden areas, this game will take you a long while to complete. Graphics are amazing and the fun factor is an outstanding 10!!!! AMAZING GAME for anyone. It is fun for anyone and is a must buy for any GBA owner!"
5,Luigi is Better,"What I think is good about the game is you can be Luigi.Luigi is a better jumper than Mario,and only a tad slower than Mario! Also when Luigi is riding Yoshi, Yoshi can spit out shells right away!THE END"
4,4 out of 5,"This game is really really really fun. You should definity buy it. The graphics are great and this game is much better then the Snes, with much more features. The only thing bad about it is that it is too easy. In a scale from 1 to 5 (1 being the easiest and 5 being the hardest) i think this games deserves a 2 out of 5"
4,"Good, but yet another remake","I'll admit this: This game is pretty fun and enjoyable. The problem? It's a remake. Nintendo seems to have gotten to hung up on remakes that they forgot that some players want new games.On the other hand, they did fix some things. For example, it now saves the number of lives you have (finally! No more gettingn 20 and then getting off and it being set back to 5). Still, it is only a remake, and I would have greatly preferred a new game."
2,Lost,"I bought this used (cheaper) for $11 plus shipping. I sent it to my parent's address. They NEVER got it. Went online to write a review how we never recieved it and the button wouldn't let me push it. When I went to a Gameday (place to buy and sell games) in town, they had the super mario I was looking for, for 25$, so I got it and my dad loves it. Not cool how I NEVER got the game from here, I couldn't get my money back and overall spent $35-36 for a classic. -_-"
4,Supermario world super mario advance 2,Our 10 year old wanted this game and has enjoyed playing it. Others in the family have also played the game and found it to be entertaining. It was a good purchase for our DS game library.
4,Super Mario World advanced 2,"I really liked this game. It was fun and enjoyable. However, if your in a lot off stress or anxiety DONT PLAY THIS GAME!!!! it can be very stressful sometimes especially looking for the switches and seceret passage ways.Anyway this is a great game for all ages and it should be lots of fun,i hope.Watch out for bowser and just try to enjoy the game."
5,Review of Super Mario World,"Great game this game has all kinds of great secret levels such as Top Secret Area where you can get an yoshi, feathers that alow Mario and Lugia to fly, and red power-up mushrooms. The game also has awesome graphics instead of a blurry screen like the old Super Mario World on the Super Nes. There is a bunch of other cool stuff about this game, but overally it is a great game."
4,Super mario world was great and this is even better!,"Super mario world was great, but now it's portable and you can play mario bros. on it too! Luigi is now a playable character because he jumps higher but doesn't accelerate as fast.BUY THIS GAME IF YOU LIKED THE ORIGINAL!"
3,Very Very Fun!,"If You Like Super Mario Bros Then You Will Like This Too! Its A Good Mario Game. Seems Like A Classic. It Has A ""Old Time"" Feel To It. It Reminds Me Of The Really Old Mario Games From Years And Years Ago. Its One Of The Better Games You Could Buy Right Now. I Like It Alot."
5,"Fun, fun, fun","I love this music. Pink Martini is a fun listen. Certainly not for everyone, but as on reviewer wrote, a great cross between classical, French jazz, new age and just plain fun."
3,Hey Eugene not up to par,"I have been a big fan of Pink Martini since I heard them first on NPR and bought their first album. I loved their second album, too; these two albums are among my listening favorites. When I attened a live Pink Martini concert in July, 2007, I really looked forward to hearing new songs from ""Hey Eugene."" The concert was great, but the new songs didn't seem to match the quality and intensity of the music from the previous two albums. There's nothing new in ""Hey Eugene,"" and some of the music is actually trite (especially the title song). The best song on the album is the Portugese song ""Sing and Dance""--it matches the best of the former two collections. ""Hey Eugene"" is not a bad album, it's just a disappointing follow up."
4,Fantastic! The whole family loves it!,"Having grown up in the 70's, I've gotten used to having my kids borrowing my ""oldies"" music. I heard Pink Martini on public radio's ""World Cafe"" and fell in love. I ordered the CD and had my girls (ages 16 to 29) listen to it....and we all love it. Finally, some new music we can all share as well!"
4,Lots of Fun,"This small orchestra of very talented musicians play an eclectic range of music with verve and wit. Quite a bit of the music is written by members of the orchestra and the arrangements, mainly by Pink Martini's leader, Thomas Lauderdale, are brilliant. All their recordings are great fun.Even better than the CDs are their live performances. If you have a chance to attend a performance, do so."
4,Theatrical!,"I LOVE Pink Martini. Their first two cd's are a staple in all my playlists. ""Hey Eugene"" is just as good as the others though it is a bit more theatrical. Can imagine each song pairing with a dramatic moment in a broadway play.The song titled ""Hey Eugene"" is a must to listen too. Great beat, funny lyrics."
4,"Hey Eugene, where are you now?","This is the third CD by Pink Martini and it has been a long time coming. I prefer the first two offerings but still wanted this one in my collection. China Forbes is a remarkable singer and the original songs by members of the group are always intriguing. The ease with which the performers shift from one language to another, skip through a variety of styles and tempos, and play with amazing techniques make this music perfect for alot of occasions. Fresh and unforgettable, Pink Martini appeals to many different age groups."
4,Perfect Summer Patio Music.,"This not as quarky or fresh as previous Pink Martini albums, but nonetheless, its definitely worth the purchase. Great mood/background music. Hey Eugene is probably the best song on the track and as the lyrics bely, based on a real experience of the lead singer."
2,One good song,"Track 8 ""Cante e Dance"" is quite beautiful, on the par I've come to expect from this group. But the rest of the album was entirely disappointing. I could not endure sitting through the whole cd on the first listen. There are some very musical passages and the musicians are tip top notch. I guess it's the selection of pieces."
2,Hey Eugene,Hey Eugene!(Again?)I expexted better than this from Pink Martini. A lot of repeats from previous CD's and the new numbers are not inspiring. Sad to see such a decline in the creativity of this group.
1,Unfinish 3rd album ?,"I own their first 2 albums & they are great ! The 3rd seems kinda human loops or incomplete band members or omitted tracks stuff or what ???It should be richer texture with some instrumental solo , the melody line should not be that repeatedly !"
4,Infused with International Flavor ~,"This album has a little of erverything!The chorus at the end of ""Hey Eugene,"" for example echoes of 1970s sitcom staples, Good Times and The Jeffersons.There are songs in Arabic -- ""Bukra Wba'do,"" (""Tomorrow and the Day After""). And Portuguese -- ""Tempo Perdido"" (""Lost Time"").You will enjoy it as much as the previous works."
4,great variety,"This is the third Pink Martini CD that I own. It's fun, like the others and always puts me in a good mood. My girlfriend thought the first song was terrible. I told her that this would soon become her new favorite album. She is almost there. Great music while preparing for a dinner party."
4,More Innovation from Pink Martini,"I'm a big fan of the group, and buy anything they come out with. This is a very interesting CD - I especially like the title track. It's not on par with my favoriteSympathique, but still quite good."
3,Time for a change,"Loved the previous 2 albums, feel a bit ripped of by this one. I guess too much of a good thing becomes... too much!Still enjoyable, just not thoroughly enjoyable. More like background music.Ok Pink Martini, now is the time to get some inspiration and produce a 4th album with some kick, new colors and tunes, and show you are here to last.All this being said because I found you all ""sympathique"" last time you came to Luxembourg. So I am yearning for more!"
5,Sublime,"As expected Pink Martini's third album fulfils every musical expectation. if ever a band was created to inspire joy it's Pink Martini. Their music transports you to the four corners of the globe and spins you in the process, spilling whatever martini you currently have in hand. China's voice and all that masculine percussional and horn support blows me every time. All three albums are every collections must haves."
5,Makeup concealer,This is a great product. Covers well and blends in very good. I found out about this product from my sister-in-law who had some and I tried it and liked how well it blended and covered. It covered my old age spots LOL very well and I would make a purchase of this product again when this one that I bought runs out. I give the seller a great rating for getting to me on time and for the price that it is being sold for. Great Great product.
1,Old Trash,"Rubbish at best. An for this San Diego, CA writer, I`d recommend a trip to Venezuela and get a grip on reality, based on his comments there is nothing further from reality than a true hearted democracy in Venezuela. Chávez arrived at the wrong historical time; his train of ideas left the world decades ago, and if you are not convinced just take a look at the Berlin Wall, ooops sorry it`s not there anymore!"
1,delivery problem,"We never received the product...It was mentioned by your services that we 'returned' the product. This is not the case.We never received the product and are still waiting for it. Yet apparently now we received a 'reimbursment' - with deduction of costs, of course.The address was correct and we are a company of 300 people, so we do not understand how this can have happened.We are waiting for your reaction (already sent a mail yesterday also).Eveline De DeckerBaltimore Aircoil InternationalIndustriepark - Zone A2220 Heist-op-den-BergBelgium"
4,the hobo philosopher,"There are two types of people that every government hates - those who speak out for peace and those that defend the ""worker"" and the poor. Mr. Chomsky is both and as you know he is always in trouble with our government. Fifty years ago, I would have thrown this book into the garbage can; thirty years ago it would have had me steaming; today I read it and sadly shake my head and wish that it were not true.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:America On Strike - A Survey of Labor strikes in America"
5,Great book..a Must for any US citizen and non-citizen...,"Fatcs, facts, facts...this book is all about the events that really occured. It's about time people turn off the T.V. and turn on Chomsky. The truth is in this book...feel free to check the facts for yourself...it's all written about but never talked about in our media...Thank you Noam Chomsky...A great book...it's about time the citizens and non-citizens alike of the USA read this...it should hold a place in your bookself."
5,Disallusioning and Necessary,"I have been meaning to read a 'full Chomsky' since reading the 9-11 book and hearing him on the radio a couple times. I found this book amazing, well constructed,fact ladden, and difficult.It's difficulty for me was timely, I want to know what we are actually up to. I found it difficult to contemplate the administrations that I thought were 'not so bad' where actually in my opinion pretty awful.I have been struggling with the concept of how is it possible to be proud of my country given the activities of the current administration. I am resigned to first being willing to get over my fairy tale innocence and be willing to know, more than i have been willing to know up to now.in this way this book was helpful."
1,Intellectual spew of stupidity,"Chomsky is nothing more than a ""dinosaur hippie"" leftover from the 70's. His assumptions are based on rhetorical nonsense, that has been chewed over since the beginning Timothy Leary.He is a prime example for the damage that drugs can do to your brain. The paranoia of drug use is evident on every page.His analysis of liking humans to bacteria, is direct evidence of his intellectual disconnect from reality. He associates himself with the very same people, that thought ""letting blood"" was a way to cure disease.To his credit. He has found an audience in his books in the aged Woodstock generation, and manages to sell his books quiet successfully. Playing on fears and conspiracy theories, that scares that generation. A fear created by the paranoia of excessive drug and alcohol abuse.Light up the bong, drop that acid, lay back and indulge yourself in stories "" Of the man"", but if you want better entertainment I suggest you watch ""The Matrix""..it's much better."
2,Two stars as a prime example of what NOT to do,"The themes here are cartoonishly simple: USA=SATAN, to be judged only by its worst failures. Everyone else=Good, to be judged by their own cynical rhetorical ""ideals"", not their vile results. Anyone other than the US obviously caught doing plain evil was forced into it by the US.The last straw for this piece of fiction was when I traced some of the sourcing for some claims back through to their ultimate origin, another publication by Chomsky himself, it having no legitimate basis at all. In other words, he just makes it up!"
1,100% garbage,"Realize that Chomsky writes from his high chair of academia and knows not from the real world.We live in a dangerous time. Usama Bin-Ladin would love to topple the world and Chomsky sees America's fight against terrorism as an attempt to dominate the world.The US is NOT trying to dominate it, rather to protect it.There is no hegemony here, only defense.Chomsky's drivel is not worth reading."
3,Brilliant thinker but not his easiest book,"Chomsky's analysis is brilliant, but there's one problem: this book is hard to read. It's dense and throws so much information at you at once. On the other hand, you can't call yourself an educated person unless you understand Chomsky's position -- because he is one of the great thinkers in our world. A Chomsky interview book, like Understanding Power: The Indispensable Chomsky, is a lot easier, because it is edited oral answers and also has a ton of documentation that is accessible. Also, the David Barsamian interviews are good, but they are a little more limited in scope, whereas Understanding Power is more of a complete introduction and kind of hits on everything. Like another reviewer, I do think people should prove Dershowitz wrong and get to the end of a Chomsky book. But that might be easier with a slightly more accessible volume -- and they exist!!"
4,Silenced by Seriousness,"Just when I thought I had reached the lowest muck of political cynicism, Chomsky shows me another level of hell. His revelations about America's Grand Imperial Strategy might make your stomach curl, while his endless banter about Israel wiil undoubtedly put you to sleep. In this book he swings from haunting insight to putrid hopelessness in a heartbeat. I thought I would love his intellectual perspectives but alas he leaves the reader with little light to guide their way out of the fog. I'm sure I can learn a lot more from him but in the future I'll take it in small doses."
3,Very Well Written,"This is a very well written book. However Mr. Chomsky loses a lot of credability with me when he writes about the praise UN officials give the oil for food program in Iraq. He has Tun Myat describing the Iraq system ""as the best distribution system that he had ever seen in his life, as a World Food Program official."" Myat also reported that the WFP had conducted more than a million inspections of the system and ""uncovered no significant evidence of fraud or favoritism."" (pg 127) With the uncovering of the oil for food scandal this tells me he may not do his research as thoroughly as some might tend to believe. This in turn makes me a little skeptical of the validity of the other information offered in this book. Because of the subject content of this book I do believe this is a must read for everyone so they can come to their own conclusions."
4,Informative,"Insightful book. Learned things I didn't even want to know but need to know. The behavior of those in power can be utterly appalling. Noam Chomsky is brilliant, but after two hundred pages it starts to sound the same. Press on, it's worth the time."
2,Another sensationalist publication,"What happened to academic credibility? What happened to logical, reasoned arguments? I read this book in England, hoping to gain insight into Bush's flaws, but all it did was make me sick with American writing. Academic writing NEVER makes so many outlandish, unevidenced claims...magazines and hollow, risky books do and therefore I classify this book with the National Star--interesting, yet unbelievable."
1,"Professor Chomsky, Whatever Were You Thinking?","Having read a number of Noam Chomsky's essays and op-eds, I was expecting ""Hegemony or Survival"" to be at the very least an erudite analysis of American foreign policy. Instead, I found Chomsky's latest effort to be little more than a political diatribe based not on solid facts, but on a reflection of his personal bias. I strongly suggest instead of the rehashed rantings of a petulant political wannabe that characterize ""Hegemony or Survival,"" that those who are seriously interested in an intellectual discussion of American foreign policy read, instead, ""The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic by Chalmers Johnson."""
2,"Smart man...hate-filled, anti-American drivel...","One is constantly reminded of Mr. Chomsky's hatred of the US with every other page. I'm surprised he didn't go as far as to say Bush eats babies for breakfast. Should be read with evil-sounding halloween soundtrack playing in the background for best effect. If Mr. Chomsky has stuck with the facts and left out the BS, I would have had a bit easier time with the read instead of rolling my eyes every 5 minutes.Why give it 2 stars instead of 1? He's a very intelligent man. Some of his points are well thought-out. They are few and far between, however."
1,Chomsky an Expert?,"How is it that someone who is a linguist can be considered any sort of foreign policy expert, or ANY kind of expert for that matter?Simple: Chomsky's arguments do one thing: feed the beast that is the far Left. Overfeed with propaganda and paranoia, in the hopes it spills out somewhat into the mainstream. Powered by the folks behind A.N.S.W.E.R. and American and international communists, he twists the truth to fit his--and their--view. Remember, he is a linguist--that's what he does.I'm not sold out on what's happened in Iraq--I think the timing was poor, and the planning for post-invasion even worse. But I am far from a Chomsky supporter...he reminds me too much of Orwell's pigs that keep reminding us that we are all equal, but he and those like him, the only ones that ""know"" the truth, are more equal."
1,"Hypocrite, traitor, fool","To call the one state in the world that has done more for human freedom than most of the rest of mankind taken together a ' terrorist state' shows just how little Chomsky is worthy of the freedom of speech America provides him. Today as I write this is the sixtieth anniversary of V-E day and it is perhaps well to remind Chomsky that the great ' hegemonist USA' entered the Second World War and by doing so saved Mankind from the scourage of Fascist dictatorship.The US did not enter Iraq to dominate the Iraqi people to liberate mankind from the dangers posed by mass- murderer Saddam Hussein.Chomsky wholly misunderstands the US and does not appreciate its freedom.This man is a hypocrite( for exploiting US freedom and remaining in a state he so condemns ) a traitor( For supporting enemies of the United States) and a fool ( For seeing the world upside down, and calling 'good ' evil, and ' evil' good."
2,Typical that this would jump to the top 10 after Chavez advertises it,"Very well written and well in context, but to be honest, this book is nothing but propaganda for those who simply dislike the Bush administration. Naiveness is so easily acquired these days, it fathoms me how people will beleive writers, celebrities and critics so easily, and ignore those with PhD's in political science or governmental administration. Chomsky is a writer, NOT a political scientist. The information is repetitive and misleading. The supported evidence is easily overturned, and leads you questioning what you read 5 chapters before."
1,Playing into their hands,"I was into Noam Chomsky a few years ago-when I was against the war. This type of rhetoric that spurs the violence it is accusing others of (ex:Che Guevara). Noam has ignored the violent death of Theo Van Gogh, the beheading of Nick Berg, and the slavery of the (western) infidels by the M-----s since ancient times. Yes, we should continue to improve American civilization,protect our freedom and environment. Noam proliferates conspiracy theories and reaches for ideologies instead of fact. I hope America wakes up and realizes it has greater and more dangerous enemies than just Dick Cheney and George Bush. America is ready for Wilhelm Reich's work now, please read, ""Man and the Trap"" by Ellsworth Baker...he goes into the character structure of liberals and conservatives-communism and fascism. The most interesting book you'll ever read."
5,"a must for some, not so much for others","To some extent, I'd say I agree with the title of the review ""One Third Rehash, One Third New Stuff, One Third Vital."" For someone who follows what Chomsky is saying, listening to various speeches and lectures he gives- a lot of which you can find online for free- a lot of this is stuff you've heard, rehash material. Count me in that group. For those who don't, this book says a lot of stuff others either are too ignorant to know or don't have the balls to actually come out and say it. I reccomend whole heartedly it for anyone who likes a book to make them think, rather than placate or rub their ego."
5,"Well-cited, always analytical, Chomsky does it again","I would only like to caution the reviewer who followed Chomsky's sources back to another publication of his own. THIS IS COMMON AMONG UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS. If Chomsky has already written a piece to which he refers, check the sources of that piece. This is very normal among people who make a living off of research. Chomsky is no pundit and I challange any two-bit Amazon reviewer to go head-to-head with him."
5,WOW! The mainstream media finally recognize America's foremost expert on world affairs!,Even though it took a head of state calling Bush the devil himself. NPR won't even touch this guy. Chomsky offers an incisive look at U.S. global domination (e.g. hegemony) and how -- despite the 'bad news' we hear all the time - people are fighting back across the planet. A quick and surprisingly entertaining read.
5,Amazing!,Absolutely amazing with a great insight on the cruel history of the U.S Imperialist mechanisms. I recommend this to anyone who is willing to learn about the true nature of this corrupt world.
2,"Acceptable, I guess","Here's the deal scoop on this. Lots of repeated questions, at least one blatantly wrong answer, and some ambiguous questions that will make you feel stupid for not getting it when in fact it's just a stupid question. A lot of times the author gets lazy and will provide the following explanation as to why the answer is correct: ""statement of fact"". Gee that doesn't help too much.I guess you can get this book if you like tough love, meaning, it MAY teach you by abusing you.Not a book for you if you don't already know the material. Only get it if you need sample questions."
3,Happy & Sad To Have This Card,"No drivers to be found to get this old sound card to work on a Windows 7 operating system. They did a good job of getting rid of those drivers or keeping it out of reach. The drivers on the cd that it came with work on Windows 95 and Windows Vista, any operating system above that you're out of luck. I love the audio chips that came in these sound cards and the drivers that helped to make it work 100%. Creative Labs Sound Blaster, I know these cards are old but I sure wish you would keep it's drivers updated on your web page to get it to work on ALL up and coming operating systems."
1,Bad purchase,Company did not include the driver for card. Card is obsolete and can not obtain from Soundblaster or Creative Labs sites. Card will not work without the driver.
1,Okay with Intel but you can do better,"The SBLive works fine on my P4. Do get the latest drivers from the and don't use those on the CD. Things never worked out on the AMD machine, I finally went to a Turtle Beach card there, and it was very straightforward. Creative's tech support was not friendly, unhelpful (""Windows is corrupted, you need to reinstall your OS""). Okay if you don't have anything to do for two weekends (one waiting for tech support to respond (for want of a better word) to your question and another to reinstall the OS. Formatting and reinstalling does fix issues but life really shouldn't be this hard. The product *is* adequate if not stellar but tech support is unavailable, unfriendly, and unhelpful."
5,No troubles,"I brought this card last year when I was setting up my new system to run Linux, and so far I haven't had a bit of trouble from this baby. Great sound, no complaints."
1,"Reminds me of old vinyl, needles, and dust","The sounds are great between snaps, crackles, and pops. Since Creative Audio hasn't ever replied to my request for a solution, I went online and ""searched"" under ""Soundblaster,"" ""live,"" and ""crackle."" You'll be surprised at the number of hits you have to choose from and explanations ranging from ""PCI bus noise"" to ""busy CPU."" Creative Audio said they were working on it (June 2001). They still must be. Avoid this board, especially with XP or 2000. If you don't believe me, do the search on google.com yourself for the ""crackle"" problem. Otherwise, expect to get the old vinyl record sound, both on PCs and Macs, and on CDs, DVDs, and games."
5,What morons,"I laugh at the people who say they cant install this card, or it wont work, crash, bad drivers, etc. I am only 17 and I have installed the card on several different computers without a problem ever. Just uninstall your current sound card, or go to Sound Properties and disable the current sound card drivers. If you have a motherboard sound card, just do the same, and when your PC starts press delete and in the Bios disable onboard sound. From there snap the new sound blaster in the PCI slot and install your new drivers. It isnt that friggin hard, and the Sound Blaster 5.1 is the best sound quality I have heard for the money. If you want better, go for a high end Turtle Beach card or a Sound Blaster Platinum/Audigy but it will cost you more. Anway, you have to have the brains to install a sound card in the first place no matter what card you install. Otherwise, take it to your computer shop and let someone else do it for you!"
1,"game sound good, the rest is bad","i got this card because my game sounds were lacking. the computer somehow fixed the problem by itself, but the card was on its way so when it came, i put it in anyway. the game sound was pretty much the same, but every time i listen to a song, regardless of how many patches and updates i pump into this stupid thing, the song skips, not only once but many times, and for prolonged amounts of time. this really gets on your nerves if you like hearing sound out of your computer. im pulling this thing out of my computer and going back to the onboard sound chip. this thing was junk."
4,No One Can Do it Like Agatha Christie!,"Agatha Christie is such a master at her chosen genre, that mystery novels are continually judged against her extensive body of work. And well they should be. She keeps her readers guessing right up until the end, over and over again. She is still truly the Grande Dame of mystey fiction writers, and her work will be around for a long time to come. In this book we have Hercule Poirot visiting a small village called Warmsley Vale. He finds himself in a real tangled mess that concerns various members of a certain family that lives in this out-of-the-way spot. The ending is a real surprise, and we the readers have such fun getting there. No one can match Ms. Christie's cunning and ingenious plots, and this book does not disappoint."
3,Christie's Taken at the Flood Kindle download,"An OK story by Agatha Christie, not one of her best in my opinion. Nice read for a lazy summer day. As usual, Agatha Christie has an array of interesting characters and subtle plot twists. I do enjoy Hercule Poirot mysteries and this was one that I had not seen or read before!"
3,Not my favourite Christie,"Christie's books are normally excellent, but I felt that this one was made up as it was written, and the strands of the mystery didn't tie in particularly convincingly. I would recommend Death on the Nile."
3,"Good Reading, But Not One of My Favorites",This book arrived in excellent condition and in a timely manner. I always enjoy reading anything of Agatha Christie's. But this one just was not one of my favorites.
4,"Greed, passion, and murder make for great reading","Solid, lesser known Agatha Christie title has the author's usual hallmarks, namely clean writing and a complicated but clearly described solution to the crime (or, in this case, crimes). Added bonuses are a picturesque setting- a small isolated English village- and an unpredictable romantic subplot in addition to the unpredictable mystery.Like virtually every Agatha Christie offering, ""Taken at the Flood"" is a fast, engaging reading experience, with not an iota of staleness despite its being around for decades."
2,Disappointed in the quality,"I purchased this GE VCR as a second unit for taping afternoon television shows while I was at work. I have had it for less than a week and while taping a talk show on Tuesday, the VCR chewed up my tape. I plan to return this VCR and buy a new Sony, which is the brand of my current VCR that I haven't had any problems with."
4,Very good VCR for the money...,The lack of time display of the front lends itself to the omittion of one star...other than that...a great little vcr
3,enjoyable read,"I did enjoy this book - it wasn't like some of the other vampire stories that I have read (and I have read alot of them) - I would probably recommend it - I usually read ""Christine Feehan"", ""Amanda Ashley"", ""Tina Folsom"", so it you like any of these authors then you would more than likely give this author a try...I might pick up another by this author."
5,Fun and relaxing To Listen To,I knew I would love because i own the first five Harry Potter Movies on DVD and I like John Williams and this is wonderful listen to with classical music cds.the composer who compased hte music for the fourth movie did a great job it's hard to distibguish between what John Williams Composed and what the other person composed.
4,a short review of Music from the Harry Potter Films,The music is very enjoyable ; I just wish there was more of the main Harry Potter theme .
4,"Good, but not Great","This CD is good, but not as good as the 1st and 5th soundtracks. It does allow you to hear specific songs from the movie that bring back the scenes: dance from #4 and march from #4. It's good if you want to review the Harry Potter movies, but I don't find it as relaxing for background music as the others. I think for me, I'm just not as much a fan of Patrick Doyle's compositions to hear outside the movie, as I am John Williams."
2,Loggins and Messina Their Music,"This is probably a great album.I've been a huge fan of theirs since their debut on ""Don Kirschner's Rock Concert""in 1972.I have every album they have made including their reunion concert in 2005.I've never seen or heard of this album before.I never buy albums or CD's that don't show what songs are on the album.This album doesn't list it's songs or even if it is a double album.Re-list this album,show it's songs,and I'll buy it."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Harrington and Burger waste a lot of time, and my money, in this book without an end. When detailing the crimes, they become rather coy and worried about being overly sensational. I appreciate that many books become lurid in their description of crimes, but Harrington and Burger are almost shy in their description.The real mass of the book is an endless litany about how long it takes to get Ng to trial, and in fact, the trial hasn't even begun when this book ends. The authors endlessly quote sources, to the point that the reader just wants to cry.I am still trying to figure-out the reason for this book. It basically tells the reader nothing, and doesn't inform in any way.Don't waste your money."
1,Dreadful,"The box proclaims Jason Santo as an award winning director. I can't imagine what awards would be bestowed upon someone producing this body of work. These are, literally, home videos. Literally, in the sense that are made by someone with a video camera, employing what must be friends to act.Overall, the short films comprising the set are remarkably bad. One, ""Haunted"" almost has something going for it and feels as though a group of moderately talented friends got together with an idea of a project but no means of executing it. It is also so poorly acted it defies description.Watching these produces that unfortunate feeling of ""I could do better than this"" which, of course, you probably could. But it would still be garbage, and we don't need more of that.I hope the director doesn't get to read this - and doubt he will, but really, this is some bad, bad stuff."
5,Healing Ministry for the Local Church,"Provides a fundamental understanding of a wholistic approach to health; a relationship between prayer and healing; and the resources, materials, and information needed to begin a healing ministry in the local church. The workbook includes both personal and group reflection and study. ""When we pray for our own healing or the healing of another, we are not in a begging posture; rather, we are intentionally cooperating with God's good will for health, wholeness, and salvation."" -- James K. Wagner"
5,He's the best,"This is the best Brazilian writer at the best of his form, and one is certain to waste his time trying to locate a handful of Brazilians who would dispute this statement. Yet, Machado (1839-1908) may well be a bore if you go about this Brazilian Literature item expecting sweaty Sonias Bragas, Jorge Amado's style, or something of the sort. The man is sharp, sophisticated, often dark, always very funny, and a hell of a narrator. The word is, well, genius. Dom Casmurro (stick to the content! stick to the content!), with its apparent simplicity, its infinite nuances, is quite possibly the best love-triangle story ever written. Worth giving a try if you like reading at all.PS. Dom Casmurro is also found in English under the literally translated title Lord Taciturn. I prefer this edition's choice."
3,"Very Good, but Bad Direction","I bought this DVD recently hoping it would exceed in quality the previous 7th Gala (2004). Unfortunately it did not. Instead of recording it from the front, apparently there was not too much space and someone had to film it from the side. Hence, all the choreographies are seen from the side view, which is not very instructive if you want to see the whole display and all the movements. As to the artists, I'm very pleased with most of them except maybe 2 or 3, whose names I won't mention for respect. I think the direction and the editing must improve, considering that these DVDs are extremely expensive. I'd rather watch the 10th Gala in person and then decide there whether I'd buy the DVD, instead of buying it and being dissapointed over the quality of the filming."
5,This was an awsome book!,"This was a great book! I loved how real it was. It is about Harriet Hemings, rumored to be the daughter of Thomas Jefferson, who had to decide whether to go into the white world or stay a slave in Monticello, the only place she had ever loved."
4,Wolf By The Ears,"This book was another well written book by Ann Rinaldi. She once again captures the struggles of a character in history. It shows some of the hardships of living as a slave. As Harriet deals with the decision of whether or not to pass as a white, or even to take the freedom granted to her, you feel as though you are right alongside her and watching her. It is a great book and very educational, but if you are looking for a fast moving book this is not the one to read. At some points it moves slowly and tends to get a little monotonous. I would still recomend that you read it because you will learn a lot about slavery and freedom."
5,what a wonderful book!,i think this book is sooooooo good. it really takes you into the mind of a slave girl and what really goes on when you are half white and half slave. i love this book so much that now i want to read all of Ann Rinaldi's work!
3,Had to read it for school,This book kind of boread me. I had to read it for summer reading. The whole book was about the charcter compelling the whole time. It was really boring the first time.
5,"Super, Wonderful, Great, Terrific- I can't say enough!","I've read this book 5 times now, and when you finish it for the first, I'm sure you'll start reading it again! The plot is perfectly balanced, and with lots of twists and turns, you get to love Thomas Jefferson one minute and hate him the next. Mrs. Rinaldi knows how to write!!!"
5,What I think,"I think this book is one of the best books I've read. It is history related and after I read it I did a whaole bunch of research on the Hemings family. Since I read that book, Ann Rinaldi has been my favorite author of all times. This book is one of those books you can't put down and you can't wait to turn the page to see what going to happen.. I defanatly suggest you read it. And ,....if it seems boring in the begining........ ................................................ ............................................... ..KEEP READING!!!!!!"
4,good book,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, although it is not the best of Rinaldi's novels. It offers another viewpoint of Jefferson's life and it was very interesting. This book is definitely worth the time to read."
2,Not Enough Depth,"While I do understand that this was a novel written for children, I feel that it didn't have enough depth and there were certain areas of the book which were unnecessary. It's just that although the subject of Thomas Jefferson's children is intriguing, A Wolf By The Ears didn't exactly present a compelling plot. While it did give an interesting viewpoint, it wasn't a truly enjoyable book to read.I give it two stars."
5,One of my favorite books!,"This book was so awesome! Sure,it took me awhile to read it, but it was definetly worth it! I would recommend it to anyone because it is such a good book. While I was reading it, Ann Rinaldi made me feel as if I was right there with Thomas Jefferson and Harriet. You must read this book!"
3,MAtrix of Power Book Review,"I found this book to have a plethora of information on the hidden linkages between disparate organizations all over the world. There are unfortunately no proof references quoted so one either has to believe or not believe the author's premises. I guess much like we use faith to accept biblical stories.It is certainly thought provoking and I would recommend it for most people to read.The readability of the book could be improved by shorter paragraphs and a clearer font, but the diagrams are very helpful and reveal significant relationships."
2,Silly producing,"It is a little ridiculous to have the violin over-powering the horn in the Brahms Horn Trio. When the cello and violin are in octaves during Tchaikovsky, the violin also overwhelms the cello. I know that Nadja is the big name that sells this CD, but I liked her playing the least of the bunch, and it is reprehensible to alter the balance so much in chamber music."
2,"Kills Battery, overheats, breaks","I bought this as a backup power cord for an IBM 600X laptop and did not have a position experience. The first problem that arose was that the converter killed the battery in my laptop. The second problem was that it got very hot while being used. It was so hot that I was nervous leaving it plugged in when I was not around. Finally, after about three months of use (yes, I continued to use it anyway), the prongs that the plug attached to in the converter came loose and didn't work."
1,Nothing but problems,"Have a Presaio 1700 with single voltage power supply, so bought this thinking it would be ideal. I used this product for about 2-3 weeks. Now my power management has failed. The battery will not hold a charge and my DVD/CD-RW drive has died. I would give this no stars, but that option in not available."
1,Buy Something Else,"I bought this adapter for my Compaq Presario M2000 and started having problems with it within a few months - the prongs in the adapter bent making it hard to connect, then the least little movement would cause it to lose power, finally, it fried my laptop battery so that it no longer held a charge. A friend that bought the same adapter for her laptop had similar problems. Not only a waste of money, but did damage as well."
4,BANGLES MEDLEY,"ONLY REASON I BOUGHT THIS CD WAS FOR THE MEDLEY...TO REPLACE MY OLD VINYL 12"".I HAVE AN E.P. CD AT HOME THAT HAS THE CALIFORINA MIX OF MANIC MONDAY AND OTHER 12"" MIXES OF THEIR SONGS...THIS CD COULD HAVE INCLUDED A FEW MORE REMIXES ESPECIALLY SINCE PRINCE REMIXED HEAPS OF THEIR TRACKS.GOOD BUT COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT!"
5,Gin is one tough cookie :-),"Gin Miller is the inventor of step aerobics. She's got all the moves and she is a great instructor. She's tough and motivating and she's not over the top like some fake instructors. She's pleasant to watch and makes you want to get up off your [...]. She also lets her sense of humour come through which is nice and refreshing.There are four workouts here and she is one of the best cuers around. This is no exception. Each workout targets a different section of your body. You use weights (wrist or ankle), dumbells and weighted balls. You don't do floorwork, but you either sit or stand so you can get your best form. It's a long workout if you do it altogether, so I prefer to do it in parts. You are going to feel the burn let me tell you, but you know what? It's an excellent workout and because it's motivating, I'm doing it and seeing results."
4,Good Deal For Your Money,"Being able to purchase 4 complete workouts on one dvd is wonderful. The workouts themselves are moderate in my opinion. Gin does take time to set up for exercises and explains sometimes too much, and I can see where this could be a bit annoying using it over and over. Yet, the workouts are solid and Gin's queing and form are definitely some of the best out there. I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a variety of weight baring routines."
1,War Stories,"without a doubt the absolute worst program i have had the misfortune to witnes. everything about this program is the worst.his over dramatization.in my humble opinion the movie 'THIRTY SECONDS OVER TOKYO""is much easier to handle."
2,Not near worth the money!!,"For the price of the book, you get little more than flashy full color photos of bobbi lifting weights. The only thing this book did well was a two paragraph description of the figure four reach."
2,more to add,I wanted to to what I said below that it seems to me that the books in the Climbing Specialist series are almost always inferior to their counterparts in the How to Rock Climb! series. In this case Sherman's Better Bouldering is definately the way to go.
1,Terrible,"Wow! I didn't think a movie could be worse than bad. I'm a beach volleyball nut, and I'm pretty kind with any cheesy volleyball movie, but not even the mother of this movie would give it better than one star."
3,movie smash,"nice looking stars, just wish i saw more of them ten more words required for a voluntary review? Aren't you presumptive. ok"
1,for the love of god dont buy this movie,"i was amazed by the lack of cleavage this movie had to offer, no nudity whats so everi would give this negative stars if i could"
2,Wow this movie is really cheese,"I read good reviews on this, I am a DOA fan and this was a recommendation. This is the most horrible movie I have ever seen. Cheesy acting, poor camera work, low budget, not interesting, what a horrible experience, it belongs on youtube."
2,Incomplete.,"Bucket is nice, but no lid was included. Advertised with lid in photo and description - I do not see anywhere where it says this needs to be bought separately. I need this to keep pet food fresh. Anyone else receive it without the lid?"
5,Great ash bucket.,Love the larger top that enables me to lower the shovel of ashes into the bucket with spilling over the side. It's great that a lid is included to allow any embers to smother. Had been using an old 5 gallon metal bucket so I'm less stressed removing ashes now.
3,Solution for a Tight Lid,Just bought this bucket locally. The lid is really tight and we couldn't get the handle above the lid. We used a pair of pliers to squeeze the rim of the bucket in order to loosen the fit of the lid. Work your way around the top of the bucket crimping the lip together and keep checking the fit of the lid. I ended up crimping the whole lip and the lid is much easier to get on/off.Only had this for two days so I can't speak to its durability or how it is going to work with the ash from our fireplace. It lost two stars for the tight lid and the difficulty of removing the label. We had to use special label removing solvent and a lot of effort.Even with the troubles I would purchase this again. The alternative was a $50 bucket from a fireplace store.
2,Where's the lid?,"I had bought a smaller can which came with the lid, this one didn't. Did people get the lid or do I have to buy it separately?"
1,Very poor design,"This product has a very poor design. The lid fits so tightly that it is a struggle to get it off, especially so since it's difficult to get a grip on the main body. The ""locking"" handle fits so loosely that it has no effect. Way more trouble than it""s worth."
1,Does not hold liquid!,"We bought this pail to hold water and soak our dirty cloth diapers in prior to washing. To our dismay, the pail is not water-tight! Beware. Do NOT purchase this item if you plan to put liquid in the pail!"
2,Don't try to remove the ugly stickers,"The can is ok as a can but it's covered in two giant stickers/labels (one pictured, the other says ""Made in the USA"" and is 2x as big). The labels shred when trying to remove them leaving behind white paper residue and glue that is impossible to get off unless you have special solvents. No thanks."
5,Perfect can to store birdseed,I'm so glad to finally locate a source for metal squirrel-proof cans to store my birdseed. The lid stays nice and tight and they're the perfect size to carry seed from feeder to feeder in our large yard.
1,Don't Buy - Defective Product,"Lid fits very snugly, which, in itself is fine. However, the handle can't take the stress of being used to remove the snug-fitting lid repeatedly (I use it daily for wood stove ash). I now have a lid that the handle has pulled right out of. And I'm 10 days past the return date. With the Amazon return policy, I'd pay for shipping and get a partial return. Just not worth the trouble to me.Simply needs to be made of heavier gauge galvanized steel, or at least with a handle that's not pulling right out of the lid."
3,It's what I expected,"I had a little trouble ""locking"" the lid until I figured it out. It's about what I expected, but I had hoped it was a little smaller. It's good value for the price."
3,Lid is too tight!,"I bought this to hold cool fireplace ashes but once you put on the lid, it is hard to get off. Had a mess as after taking out the ashes and putting on the lid, when it came time to dump the ashes the lid stuck and when I did get it off, I had ashes all over the place as I had to use some force to get it open. Wasn't fun cleaning up the ashes off me and the trash can.But it does do the job. Just be careful with the lid."
4,Works for cat food,I use this to store dry cat food and it stays locked if I keep the handle upright. I needed something that my six cats couldn't open since they were always opening the cupboards in the kitchen. They are able to open the can with the handle down so I need to remember to put it back up every time I close it.
3,Versatile Can with many uses,"I bought this can to use for a pet waste receptacle. I wanted something metal to contain odors and was happy to find this made in the USA but after using it for just a few months the handle on top of the lid came off. It was just inserted into the lid by tabs, and so my husband will drill holes and re-fasten the handle with screws so it won't come off. I was disappointed with this flaw as I was going to purchase more of these for bird seed storage, now I'm not so sure I will."
1,LEAKS!,Do not buy this bucket if you plan to use it for transporting liquid of any kind! It leaks horribly! Completely useless for what I intended to use it for.
2,"I was sent a ""Made in Mexico"" Can, NOT Behrens!","I'm quite disappointed in Amazon for this switch- I thought I was purchasing an item made in the USA. Instead,I got a no-name brand, made in Mexico. It's not a Behrens. That being said, I needed a can with a lid for a diaper pail, and the ""fake"" can is still the best option I've seen yet- it's just made in Mexico, not in the USA, and not by Behrens. While the can suits my purposes, the lid isn't as tight as I was expecting, based on the reviews of the real Behrens cans. Insects would be able to get in without my diaper liner filling the gaps. I'm very unhappy that Amazon advertised one item, and then shipped a different item with a different level of quality- if you look through the rest of the reviews, this isn't the first time they've done this for this product."
1,NOT as advertised,'Locking Lid Can' with a lid which will not fit on to the top of the can any which way I attempt to push it on. Chances are it will eventually be forced on and not come off. Worthless...
5,Bird Seed Holder,"I purchased this item for my husband to use as a bird seed holder. It works great at keeping the squirrels, mice and other rodents out of the bird seed. He is very happy with it."
3,Good value,"This is a great bucket, with ample space. A few minor things bother me about it, though. It came with a bunch of packing tape on the lid, which seems wholly unnecessary for a product that has a ""locking lid."" The tape and residue was difficult to remove. I would also prefer the handle to be shaped differently to make it more comfortable. Six gallons of most things you would put in here (sidewalk salt for me) ends up being pretty heavy and the thin handle cuts into my hand when holding it for a while. If only it had a wooden handle added to the center, it would be pretty perfect."
4,Excellent Seal,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. The lid locks tight. When removing the lid, you can feel the suction. The material is pretty thick for the small size. The handle isn't comfortable but does provide a good lock on the lid.I actually bought this to store electronics in case of natural or human caused EMP (such as a solar flare, high altitude nuke, or accident). Sound crazy? It is a little overly prepared; I'll admit that. But, I work in the electric industry and understand the risk of solar flares. I want to have a few cheap items like walkie talkies, hand crank radio, solar flashlight and such available just in case. Hey, I use those items camping anyway. So, why not store them in a nice weatherproof and EMP proof container. Oh, be sure to use an insulator like cardboard or trash bag between can and electronics. I figured, If I had to buy a container, why not get a high quality container like this one?"
1,I should have read the reviews.,This item arrived very poorly packaged. There was no packing slip and no lid. Claim subsequently filed. We'll see what happens.
4,quite a nice tight bucket,"I bought this to use with our dutch oven cooking: warm ashes can be hauled away in this as the lid fits tightly. I keep new charcoal in it to keep it dry. It would work well for bird seed, pet food. I would have gone 5 stars but the handle is a bit tough to tighten down. But the lid is tight and it is well made."
3,Not as specified,"When we purchased this product the listing said the product was ""new"" with damage to the packaging only! After receiving the package we noticed that the can itself had some dents and scratches in it. We will keep the product as the dents are not in an area where it will render the can useless but we were frustrated to see that the product we received was not what we expected to be getting based on the description. The can itself seems to work great. The lid fits snug (almost too sung)."
1,Received Defective Product,"Unfortunately, mine arrived with a defective seal in the bottom seam. The defect was so obvious that it should have NEVER left the factory. I had to pound it out with a hammer (so it would sit level) and seal it with some silicone caulk to plug the hole. I know I could have returned it, but all the hassle over a $15 product just isn't worth it. It's really too bad, because other than the one manufacturing defect, it appears to be a very nicely made, well designed product. Hope you have better luck."
3,"adequate quality, but not great","The upper rim of the can is not quite round, so it takes some strength to mash the lid on or to pull it off"
5,Nice Exterior Water Shedding Container,"Nice feature of this product is the convex lid keeps water from getting in when kept outside. Surprisingly this is a hard feature to find, all the plastic containers I looked at had inset lids.Re: ""the stickers"", soak it in water to remove the majority of the paper sticker, then a little Goof-off or mineral spirits cleans up the adhesive if it's an issue for you."
5,The best for long term storage,"I use this when i buy bulk at Costco, and there is no problem with contamination. Creatures cannot get into you stuff. Unlike the plastic storage bins."
5,THESE ARE GREAT!!!!,I ordered these about a year ago. They do not disappoint. Got one for bird seed and the larger one for dog food. We had a mice problem. Well no more. These are worth the money. Never will buy plastic to store stuff outside in again. They look nice too!
5,Exactly what it looks like,Works perfect. We use ours to dispose of fireplace ashes and it's been perfect. No problems and the lid is a must have.
1,Didn't come with the lid,"Received this item, a ""Locking Lid Can"", without the lid, even though the item picture shows a lid, and if it says anywhere the lid isn't included, I couldn't find it. I tried contacting the company and they said it's not their problem, and to return it if I'm not satisfied.Update* Found this exact item at Lowe's, with the lid, and it was cheaper."
5,Phyllis,"We are using the 10 gal cans for dog food and ashes from grill. Great product. Looks nice, lid fits good and being in the south where it is humid, no rust. Also bought another for a pottted tree...just painted the can and lid and used some artwork on the side.....great looking pot. We found many used for this size can."
3,Fun cozy mystery romance with action,"Fun read. Easy on the brain, funny quips and action. More lawyering than in previous books, but I'm getting irritated by the blurb on all the covers on how the author is the female John Grisham. No, that isn't this author's style. This is closer to a cozy mystery rather than a legal thriller. It happens to be about a lawyer but it is not a legal thriller. Hate to be pedantic about it, but I was a little disappointed that the book doesn't live up to the blurbs. It's good for what it is."
3,great read UNTIL ...,"The book was a fun read, well paced interesting characters UNTIL it got to the last 50 pages, then it just fell apart!!! The main character went from a lawyer to being James bond wrapped up in a FBI man. She not only solves the murder but sets up the guy and catches him!! It was like reading a comic book, very implausible and silly."
2,Just fair....,"I agree with the reviewer about the ""double dialogue"" - Rita's sarcastic comments in her head, and their contrast to what she actually says. The problem is that these comments are the best part of the book. The poker-playing buddies, as well as Rita's dad, are all stock ethnic stereotypes and unfunny, to say nothing of unbelievable. The Main Line ""WASP"" types are also a stereotype and never come alive as characters.I will admit that I didn't guess the murderer so must give Lisa some kudos. However, the surprise romantic ending had no basis in the book; I even went back to the relevant section to see what was said and it was just a few sentences. Huh?Unlike some other reviewers, I don't know that this one could keep my attention over the course of a plane ride."
4,senior citizen sleuths,"wacky and witty characters, steady pacing. more of a detective story than a legal drama, though brief courtroom scenes are memorable. a lively and enjoyable breeze to read."
3,Lacking in courtroom drama --- a legal thriller with a twist,"Good read with lively and gutsy heroine. Plot which has disappointed lawyer commiting murder is stretching it but sub plot of father daughter relationship and conflict with live in boyfriend is thought provoking. A modern, realistic look at marriage, co-habitation: judge's wife turning blind out to blitz of affair; Rita's forgiving Paul of his infidelity ..."
4,It was a lot of fun!,"I thought Rita was a neat person and I really liked her""poker pals"". They added a lot to the plot. I also liked the comments she made in her mind before she spoke something different. This is the first book of Lisa Scottoline's that I've read and need to fine more."
2,Something missing,"While enjoying the Scottoline style I found that this book (listened to unabrideged) missed a key plot element in setting up ""The Sting"". Without giving away the plot there were unanswered questions that were never addressed. I found this book to be a bit frivolous."
3,Unrealistic,"First of all, I love Lisa Scottoline's books, however this one you have to really suspend almost all belief to enjoy. The main character is Rita Morrone and she is NOT a criminal attorney however becomes a great one for one case. She decides not only to defend the federal judge accused of murdering his mistress but to solve the case. She has three senior citizens helping her with her ruses to find out information. The book is very well written and is action packed. It's a quick read and an easy read. I would recommend it for other Lisa Scottoline fans and someone looking for a good read, but doesn't care about things being realistic."
2,"Aside from the poker pals, a disappointment","I started out liking this book. Rita Morrone, Philadelphia lawyer, is a sassy lady with a penchant for play life like a poker game. Indeed, her best friends are her father's poker cronies and they are probably the most memorable thing about this book.Despite Barbara Rosenblat's splendid narration (as always), this book doesn't click. The pacing is inconsistent, particularly at the end which has about three extra chapters. Rita's legal life and ethics go beyond any reasonable suspension of disbelief. She's a partner at her age??? She has no clue as to legal ethics??? Get real. And it's too bad, because I like the poker buddies and would love to encounter them again."
5,A cast of characters that shine!,"Another strong woman lead, with a supporting cast of characters (the pep boys) that made reading this book a true joy. The humor was sarcastic yet endearing. A perfect Italian family with the added bonus of a cleverly written mystery storyline."
3,A book for the beach,"This book is easy to read and you can read it in one or two days, but it goes out of the story so many times, or I have to say so many chapters? You will laugh many times while reading the book but other times you will be bored of the way she explain other things that are out of the main story.I can't tell you that this book is a waste of time but is not the best that I have read, If you have one or two days in the beach maybe you can read it there."
4,Can't put down,"The book is totally unrealistic but it does not matter. It's a fun read that never bores. I have read one other book by Scottoline and find her to be an author that keeps the fun coming. I am not giving it a five star review because there was not enough of Rita in court, the only flaw with the book. Take it on an airplane with you and you will finish before the flight is over."
4,"A ""FUN"" Legal Thriller","I thoroughly enjoyed this book; I even laughed out loud a few times. I don't ever re-hash the storyline when I take the time out to do a review - it is done again & again - so you already know the essence. I will say that the plotline is sound, the dialog refreshing & the characters are endearing. RECOMMENDED!"
4,Highly Entertaining,"I can understand how Lisa Scottoline's distinctive writing style would appeal to some readers but turn off other readers. I thought the dialog was catchy and humorous. The characters were credible. The plot and sub-plots were believable enough to hold my attention. There were even a few moments of pathos. Best of all for me, the book was highly entertaining."
2,Not worth it,The plastic tube that'w apparently supposed to make it more comfortable where the two ends of the rubber tube meet... isn't (more comfortable).The sliding tube doesn't stay tight against the plastic joint tube mentioned above. Don't bother!
3,About The Gift,This book is terrific around christmas and it`ll lift you into the the holiday spirits. Home for Christmas was a little to quick for me.I understand that the couple had known each other for a long time but they moved so quickly back into there relationship.Faith was upset wasn`t she but she quickly let Jason back into her heart.I guess it was based on how many pages the story was supposed to have. Overall I enjoyed it especitally the ending.No one is better then Nora Robert except (Danielle Steel and Mary Higgins Clark) but even Roberts measures up to them.All I want for Christmas is very good alll Zack and Zeke want is a mother and Christmas is a food time for wishes and dreams.Theses six year old boys are adorable.The story is very exciting but why do all Nora Roberts characters have a temper? I don`t understand but anways if you`ve read Nora Roberts you can expect a great short story novel.
4,Short and Sweet,"While I am a huge fan of NR, these 2 books lack the strength of her latest books. These 2 stories were short...so short in fact, one can read them in a 2-hour sitting!"
5,Refreshing,I enjoyed this book so much. It was not too long but is well written. I would recommend reading it. Enjoy it!! I did!!!
1,Don't waste time or money on this,Corny stuff. Predictable and over-dramatic characters and plot lines. I received the book as a gift from someone who knows I like to read alot. Glad I didn't shell out the $$ for this one myself. I'm embarrassed to even re-gift it to someone else.
3,Pretty witty,"This novel, about unsure married partners and parents of a young child, seemed to have that grain of reality throughout. I liked the way the author went into their minds and, for better or worse, laid out their feelings. I am going to backtrack and read what I've missed by Ciresi as this was my first book by her I've ever come across."
1,"Dry, boring wanna be","This book tries, but fails. The jokes are dry. Humor is dated. I couldn't finsih it. The story had nothing to pull me in. Get Sophie Kinsella instead, you will be much happier."
2,an average read,"I think it is hard for me to reconcile the fact that this is the sequel to Pink Slip, which was truly funny and smart. This follows the mariage of Eben and Lisa, but isn't as warm or touching. It is pretty realistic abou thte difficulties of marraige but deosn't show the joys very well. Lisa strikes me as very off-putting in this.i agree with another reviewer who was just as puzzeld as I about the disappearance of family and friends-I loved those characters (especially Lisa's Mom) in book 1. Without these characters, the book is very neurotic and Lisa frankly seems self-obsessed.Even with my gripes, I still say Ciresi is a very good author. I kept right on reading the book to see how it would end."
4,Falwell- More than I Expected,"Purchased through Amazon.Excellent book about a visionary whose journey was not a straight path. Worth reading for those who ""think"" they know the man."
1,What a bigot,"I am scared out of my mind that this man is our reverend. He is so full of himself and is teaching thoughts that the Pope Leo X taught, who was proved wrong by Martin Luther. He has his facts wrong and has no clue what he is talking about. His facts are false. So is his book."
1,A lot of jingoistic sanctimony- no substance or insight.,"Nowhere in this book do we find what truly is the source of Falwell's animus towards Ellen DeGeneres, Tinky Winky or Larry Flynt. We want to know why Falwell propagated that nonsense about ""Clinton murders."" Too bad you won't find it here.Someone once said that the unexamined life is not worth living.We're still waiting for Falwell's examination."
1,HORRIBLE LITTLE MAN,"What a horrible little man and what a horrible little biography. Jerry should be ashamed of himself. He has created more misery and drove so many, many away from the church. Recommned this book as a good fish wrapper. Keep it away from your children. Use it as shredded bedding in your ferret cage, at least they cannot read, which is good, cause Jerry certainly cannot write."
2,Gifts of Christmas,"Back cover descriptions: Suzanne Barclay/KARA'S GIFT-A pagan healer falls in love with the Christian knight who is destined to save her dying clan.Margaret Moore/THE TWELFTH DAY OF CHRISTMAS-A charming nobleman has twelve days to win the love of his intended bride.Deborah Simmons/A WISH FOR NOEL-An orphan's Christmas wish comes true when she conquers the heart of her world-weary guardian.I agree with the reviewer from GA that the Deborah Simmons story is the best of the lot, but it could have used more time to develope the plot and characters. However, I wasn't really thrilled with the other two stories. The hero in Ms. Moore's story just wasn't appealing-his transformation from vain jerk to love of the heroine's life wasn't convincing. In Ms. Barclay's story, the hero just doesn't seem to be all that smart. It doesn't seem at times as if the hero or heroine are in the same story--pagan christians, christians, druids--what?"
5,"Vivid, candid, shocking -- a clarion call to action!","An abuse and incest victim as a child, Susan Kesegich struggledto understand how it could happen to herself and her sisters. Borninto a poor, rural family that often went without food, electricity and plumbing, Kesegich and her four siblings suffered extreme neglect, sexual, mental, and physical abuse with intervention by responsible adults, school, church or community agencies. Kesegich was eventually able to understand her childhood traumas and work to help other women and children through volunteer efforts at a local child abuse center and become trained as a special court appointed advocate for children. Twisted Roots Of Evil is vivid, candid, shocking, and a highly recommended testament to conditions that still persist in all too many areas of the country."
5,EXCITING,Could not put it down this was the most heart wrenching book I have ever read. the way the author told the story threw her eyes made it so real to me. this book has made me look at life from a different point of view. I hope we can she more to come.
5,Twisted Roots of Evil,"This book was an eye opening experience for me. Many of us tend to run from our past and refusing to deal with it. When i read the book it made me realize that i am not the only one as a child that has suffered at the hands of a trusted adult and will continue to tell others i know about TWISTED ROOTS OF EVIL, A real page turner, when i read it i had to keep a box tissue near me. Until more people open there eyes and realize this is happening and speak up and stop the abuse then it will continue."
2,Seatworks fitness CD for senior citizens,"Unfortunately, this product was totally inappropriate for the people at my dad's senior apartment complex. It was not marketed as being as vigorous as it was. The people are used to doing seat exercises but the pace was too fast and the number of movements was too advanced. Basically it is useless for what I had hoped would be a fun new workout."
3,a good bag and a good fit,"not a bad bag - the size is right, but the straps are in the wrong position. they get in the way of the seat release. it seems to ride nice under a normal load, but weighted tends to shift. also remember the seat on the ruckus does not lock...so anything in the bag is fair game. another con is the bag is not water proof. shipping was very expensive. still something is better than nothing. the price is high too, but it fits...honda ruckus rules!"
4,"Handy, Durable, Reasonable Price","I bought this for my younger brother who rides his Ruckus around town for errands and to work (10miles) when traffic might cause delays. He loves the bag and can fit all his daily items and some tools in there too. Appears to have quality construction and no problems after almost 2 years of use.Would recommend to Ruckus owners who don't want the expense of the hard storage or the cheap, exposed mesh I have seen out there. Of course, to each his own."
5,Outstanding!!!,This is the second bag I have purchased. They are excellent bags. The buying experience was easy and the products arrived very quickly. Highly reccommended.
3,Not bad. Plastic is better,This bag is pretty cool but if you like to mod your Ruck or have a drop seat frame this is maybe not the best option. There are some carbon fiber underseat trays on ebay for three bills but you can find an even better alternative in black ABS plastic for about a $100 on there. Check it out!
4,not worth it,"bag is nice but for $80-90, ""not gonna do it"". a 10-15 dollar nylon gym/duffel will do same thing. no need for perfect fit as this bag is closer to that as advertised. velcros attach are clumsy and bag it self takes up storage capacity."
4,"It may not be ""true flamenco"", but it's great!","I read about this CD in a specialty catalog -the kind of catalog where very little actual description is given; the reviewer just writes about her feelings about the music. Well, I decided to take a chance and buy the CD, and I could've spent twice as much money and still have been happy. I find the music haunting, invigorating, and infectious. The only thing I don't like about the CD is the rapid decline in tempo from the beginning of the recording to the end, but I've adjusted."
3,"Good, but not great.","Ottmar Liebert is obviously very talented, and his music is enjoyable. The truth is, all his music sounds the same because he's not a superb SONGWRITER! His greatest achievement to date is his collaboration with Leda Battisti. She's brought out something better in him. Get that CD if you want something new, but if you just want to tap your feet, any of Liebert's CD's will do just fine. Choose the cheapest."
2,Novuveau Flamenco,"When I purchased this CD (so I thought)...I figured what a great deal. The delivery was relatively quick, and to my surprise it was a cassette tape. No big deal as I still have a cassette player, and this explains the $1.98 tag on Amazon dot com. In fact the shipping cost more then the product.However I'm dis-appointed on the tape quality...the tape dragged from the start and I had to use a pencil insert in the cassette to get it started for rewind and or fast forward.What can I say...$1.98 + $3.98 shipping...Anyway..I call this a loss as there's no use sending it back as cost well exceeds the purchase."
2,Repeating.....Repeating,"Ottmar did compose some great songs but there is definately passion missing from his cd's and performance. That is where Alex Fox comes in......Full of passion, energy and variety. The best guitarist around. ALEX FOX"
3,music from my childhood dance years....,"NOVEAU FLAMENCO, by Ottmar Liebert, is an album that brings back memories of jazz dance recitals. We used to warm up to NOVEAU FLAMENCO, particularly the first track, ""Barcelona Nights."" Liebert has been equally criticized and proclaimed for his laid back approach to ""nouveau flamenco."" While flamenco purists will most definitely have some cutting remarks to make about this, his debut album, how sleepy and ""plugged in"" it sounds, others who are just looking for relaxing music that they don't have to think too hard about will definitely enjoy it. For me, this European born, Santa Fe-based musician balances his own jazzy licks with flamenco inspired guitar work, and it works well as back-up music. Would I shell out thirty dollars to see him live? Probably not. Yet, I definitely can't dislike NOUVEAU FLAMENCO's range of songs. While some are peppy, others are great if you are trying to get a good night's sleep. There's nothing wrong with that!"
2,Nouveau Flamenco is what now?,"The self-stylized Nouveau Flamenco artist had to call it something new since it's not Flamenco. It's like any kind of pop treatment of serious music, from Yanni to Kenny G. It's ethnic elevator music.My aunt put this in the CD player a few Christmases back and hit repeat. I've heard it dozens of times; more than enough to give it a fair shake. Please consider something more traditional and with more serious musicianship (I've seen Mr. Liebert play and the best thing about it was the rhythm team and second guitar player, Calvin Hazen; all handily outshined their marque). You might try Paco deLucia who is widely considered the master of Flamenco guitar. There are also young artists out there who are terrific; eg, Vicente Amigo.Another reviewer who gave this 5 stars said it puts him to sleep at night. That's overly modest, this album can put you to sleep at any hour of the day."
5,Awesome!!,"Even though this is not classified as a true flamenco sounding, it is such a great passion on six strings. For any true flamencoist, you might need to open your mind because flamenco can be infinate and endless. BEAUTIFUL INDEED!!"
3,"Groundbreaking, but tame.","This CD was definitely a groundbreaking record commercially, but for those who want great guitar playing with great tunes, check out anything by Strunz and Farah, Paco De Lucia, Al DiMeola, Jim Stubblefield, Johannes Linstead, or even Armik."
1,Get Rich Quick Scheme,"K-Mart Leibert should awaken from his sleep and go to the University of New Mexico and enroll in some flamenco courses. I would highly recomend that if you want music that is more passionate and musically much more intricate buy any release by artists such as Gerardo Nuñez, Vicente Amigo, Chicuelo, Paco de Lucía, Tomatito, any guitarist on the street.Don't waste your time listening to unadventurous music, get the real thing! Unless, you are afraid of expanding you mind. You are smarter than that aren't you?"
5,"The ""It's A Wonderful Life"" of Comics","Here's a rarity in the current comic book enviroment: a story old-fashioned, sentimental, and true to its characters, rather than propelled by rapping sidekicks or less-than-permanently death. I'd encourage anyone, even those readers who would never pick up a ""funny book"" to give this one a spin. The feeling it envokes has as much to do with wistful yearning for an America that maybe didn't exist but should have as it does tell a good Supes beats up Luthor story."
2,Average superman comic,"Superman For All Seasons is an average Superman Comic. I think it is a little overated and the only reason why it is so popular is because of its creators, Loeb and Sale. The story line is not the best, Although I did enjoy the illistrations."
3,"Good Story, Bad Artwork...","Lets put some realistic comments on this book, firstly the story is fantastic. However the artwork in this book is really bad, they make it feel like a kid has drawn the pages of this book.Instead of making Superman look powerful they made him look silly looking."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"I suppose overall you would call this a sweet story.A lot of wishful thinking here too, I suppose, for nice little rural towns that used to be.Clark Kent movies to Metropolis, and things are going ok, until his treatment of Lex Luthor and having him arrested leads Luthor to try something that Superman's powers really can't stop.This leads to the man questioning the Superman, and needing some small town time.The dog is very cool, too."
4,Great Book for Fitness Beginners,"Shaping Up focuses on how to start your own personalized fitness program. It covers all aspects of exercise, nutrition, and weight loss. Before reading this, I read ""The Everything Total Fitness Book,"" and found that ""Shaping Up"" was a terrific supplement to that book.The book is effective. After reading it, I was able to determine the right exercise program and nutritional plan for me. The information is based on the most recent findings in studies.I especially like the section on sensible weight management, but the whole book was helpful. The weight management section describes some of the most popular fad diets (such as the ""no carbs"" diet) and compares them to healthy eating as recommended by health associations."
4,I love this book.,"I'm not entirely sure how often the author, Bill Bryson, writes in jest, and how often he is actually betraying his pedantic, pompous and pretentious side.There are a number of cases of apparent hypocrisy on the author's behalf, regarding the use of pretentious and pompous language. These few occurrences aside, I can find little fault with this book, but much praise for it. Enlightenment and humour are abundant, eliciting many chuckles each time I sit down for a good read of this book.This is not a book that one can enjoy reading for very long at a time, since the memory reaches saturation rather quickly - it is a dictionary, after all. Hence, short daily doses are what Dr Benesato recommends to get word better user.Benesato."
3,Nothing special.,Performs as advertised - but this is a commodity item so buy this product by price.Brett
3,Content is good,I found the general material helpful as a summary of information. There are many spelling errors in this book. The disk that comes with the book contains the same questions as is in the book as samle test questions. Okay compared to others. After I took the test I feel this book misleading as to test content.
3,Self-help books in general!,"Most self help books oversimply or make the process too difficult for you to use on your own. Oversimplified or too complicated, either way, the reader does not receive the help they need.I personally tried to use this book and just found it too complicated and convoluted to use without the assistance of a therapist or someone else. Also, when one sees the word ""workbook,"" one thinks of a book with SHORT and SIMPLE exercises with a place for you to write your response. This book was filled with exercise but the questions were not simple and they are time consuming.The author has a website and works with clients directly on the phone. This probably would be easier than using the book on your own: h t t p :// joincathryntaylor.com/ (take out the spaces)"
4,Organized and Handy,"Great set of screws and bolts. Organization is the most difficult part of keeping screws. I have hundreds that I can't find. But this assortment as screws all organized for me. The boxes are a bit smaller than I thought, but portable.My only issue is that the boxes are a bit difficult to open. There are lots of better boxes out there, but this is the only set I found that has the screws already organized for you."
2,Pretty cheaply made and small sizes,"But, what do you expect for the price. I though there would be bigger bolts - everything in here is pretty darn small. The cases are super made-in-china classics that i do not expect to work after a handful of uses -the latch being super flimsy and weak. The ""Free"" case is a joke - barely fits into the rack - you have to jam it in. Mine cases came jammed into the rack and don't fit neatly even out of the box. It's all super cheapo, but it's a decent assortment for the price."
3,It's okay!,"The assortment of nuts and bolts met our expectations. The plastic containers are a little weak, but like the rack."
3,"Good television, but word of caution before buying.","Four years ago my sister and I each bought this television for our respective kitchens. Almost to the same day, about six months ago, both sets demonstrated the same problem: the plug has to be pulled from the socket for the on-off switch to work. Everything but the on-off switch is fine. Since I paid slightly more than the advertised price here, to pay at least $75 for repair (minimum labor and bench fee) doesn't make sense. For $25 more, I could buy a brand new television. There's something wrong about that. My sister and I are buying new kitchen sets, but this is not going to be the one we buy. A TV should last more than 4 years!"
2,"decent picture, poor reliability","Although the picture quality/contrast & controls were fine, there's just no compensating for typical G.E. (lack of) quality. After the warranty period was up (naturally), it began to show problems: not turning on, sticking on certain channels, etc. For the money, you can get a Sharp or Sony, a much better piece of HW."
4,PROMISING,"WHILE THIS EP IS NOT AS WELL PRODUCED AS THEIR LATER WORKS, IT SHOWS A PROMISING AND HUNGRY YOUNG BAND. VIRGIN BLACK ARE IN A LEAGUE ALL THEIR OWN, AND TO NOT OWN THIS CD IS A TRAVESTY IN ANY METAL COLLECTION!"
4,On an Airplane?,"I first came across Ms. Melua on a 5 hour flight from Washington D.C. to Sacremento. The airline's 'radio station' was playing her CD from start to finish and I was able to hear enough to pique my interest. All I can say is 'Wow.' I keep seeing her compared to Norah Jones, which I think is completly unwarrented. Norah Jones doesn't hold a candle to Katie's beautifully sultry, subdued tone. Most of her songs are cover's of tried and true blues/jazz tunes. This shouldn't dissuade you from picking up the album however, as she brings new life to each and every song she sings."
3,Damaged goods,"Hi,I'm very pleased to get this item but I would like that you use a better packingmaterial. Like hard carbon box because the CD plastic was very damaged."
3,"CD of Katie Melua, Call off the Search","I have not yet received the product. On your e-mail confirmation you typed next to the city of destination ""Carimate"" Como, which is the province but also a city."
5,Think: Cocktail Music / Wedding Receptions,"OK, I have nothing against Norah Jones, but it's nice to change up the music and ""mix it up"" - I think mixing in Katie's CD for cocktail music is perfect!!! It has that sound that's just right and enjoyable as guests mingle. Make sure you at least listen to this CD -- and hopefully you'll end up buying it! It's great. It's even a nice 'cozy' CD for couples to play as they spend the night inside together :)"
1,Thumbs down,"Comparing Norah Jones and Katie Melua is like comparing Pavarotti and Julio Iglesias. When I hear ""Closest Thing to Crazy"" I'm getting closer to crazy than ever!The way Katie drags the notes is extremely annoying. However she is not the only one responsible for this. The producer should have stopped this whining right away!"
1,"BIG NO, NO","Hate the voice, it's very irritating and amateurish. The songs are great though- i just hope somebody recorded it."
2,A Lulu of a singer,"I too bought this CD after hearing so many comparisons to Norah Jones. Upon listening, I saw no similarities. I did however feel like I was listening to the second coming of that 1960's British chanteuse, Lulu (famous for singing the title song from the film ""To Sir With Love"").I found Katies CD to be pleasant enough, but not particularly edgy or complex. Pretty basic, vanilla renditions.The good news is that she is very young and will probably get better with age and experience. For someone just getting into jazzier kinds of ballads, this CD is an OK start. For someone who really appreciates mature musical stylings, this will be a letdown."
3,"It's OKAY, but nothing spectacular","I first heard about Katie Melua in a commercial that was promoting this album. I thought she sounded great, and she looked very young and charming. I listened to a little of the album itself, and it made me think...hm, she looks a little like Norah,as many have said, but i wouldnt necessarily say she SOUNDS like Norah. As mature as this young lady is, i think her vocals sound a bit childish and whimpery compared to the more mature and seductive voice of Norah Jones. But putting that aside, this girl does have potential, there's no doubt about that. But i think its unfair and irrelevent to compare her to Norah Jones. She's just starting, and she has a lot going for her, and will probably get better as she gets older."
2,katie,I saw Katie perform on PBS. I love how she sounds when she sings far away voice. The rest of her songs aren't so good due to the goofy lyrics and her childish voice. If she gets better material then more people would know about her.
2,"Um, Norah Jones can sleep easy...","...because this girl doesn't have a tenth of her style or warmth. Very generic Europop, the kind of stuff that regularly shows up on Pop Idol. In other words, nothing special at all."
1,what a disappointment,"After reading most of the rave reviews of this CD on Amazon and listening to a couple of snippets I purchased it and wish I had not. I have never written a review here but feel like I need to since the CD is simply not even close to being as good as other reviewers have said. If you are considering purchasing this, I recommend you listen to the full CD yourself before buying."
3,Solid debut from talented singer-songwriter,"Katie Melua's debut album is one that does not quite capture the intimacy of the songs when listened to at home. The single ""Closest Thing to Crazy"" comes across wonderfully and Belfast demonstrates a not often heard ability for using metaphors in a pop song. Sadly, the other tracks all seem to have suffered somewhat in the production process and are all a bit glossy, having lost a certain amount of rawness. Her voice, however, has a charming innocent quality reminiscent of Björk and I can well imagine her being excellent live. This is definitely worth catching for lovers of mellow female singer-songwriters and readily accessible for those looking for something of that ilk."
4,Intimate,"Katie Melua may technically not be the best of singers and she is nowhere in the same league as Diana Krall or Jane Monheit, but I somehow like this album, because her style is intimate -'kid sister' intimate, but intimate all the same - and touches a chord. My favourite songs are ""Being close to craziness"" and ""Lilac Wine"". ""Lilac Wine"" made me pull out my Elkie Brooks version. Elkie is brilliant and powerful, but the way Katie Melua sings it, it's as if she's singing to you. Makes you feel special. Thanks!"
5,Superb,"Mr Fourie, another South African reviewer unfortunately cannot tell the difference between Norah Jones and Katie Melua.........sad because Melua exudes such appeal, warmth and 'listen to me' spunk. A superb debut album, a ringing voice and great songwriting ability."
4,We seem to be missing some material here,"I just downloaded a CD called ""Piece by Piece"", liked it and decided to buy (I don't pirate), but oops, nothing here. The CD is new and currently a UK import (for a singer from Georgia? Make that Georgia, former USSR, but you can't tell!). Very nice, like Kristin Hersh without a quirky edge, but not so far as to be smaltzy, check it out if you can. Anyone who covers ""Just Like Heaven"" rates in my book, but it looks like I'll have to wait to give her the $14 she deserves."
2,A New Talent - Getting There,"The Amazon review hits it pretty much on-target. She has the voice and talent for a great career - her choice of materials could use much more work. This is decent CD - some great and excellent tracks where her voice rises to the material - her voice works best on sexy and melancholy cabaret choices like BLAME IT ON THE MOON and I thought her performance on MY APHRODISIAC IS YOU was a cute, sexy, breathy cabaret take (as opposed to the Amazon review who dislaiked it) but on other tracks when she has to really ""plow"" into it, she is clueless for instance, butchering the MOCKINGBIRD SONG. If you like to hear all new talent, you should give her a listen but right now, you should just buy a few tracks until she gets the material to match her strengths."
4,"Sweet, Soulful, Tender...","There is much more here than just the Norah Jones influence. It is easy to hear Maria Muldaur in Katie Melua's vocals, and that influence makes her renditions sweeter and lighter than Norah's. ""Crazy..."" totally blew me away. ""Learnin' The Blues"" is remade into a more refreshing tune and ""Lilac Wine"", which no one should dare sing after Nina Simone recorded it, is superb. There are a few songs which are good but not great, but on the whole the best new CD of the year. BUY THIS ONE!!"
4,4 stars review,"Super album, same level as Norah Jones,good songs, superb guitar playing.This album should be present in everybodieshouse."
3,Did Nora Jones write the songs?,"I heard one or two songs on TV and got all excited. I rushed out to buy the CD. After listening to the entire CD, I must admit that I'm a little disappointed. It sounds exactly like a Nora Jones CD. Not that there is anything wrong with Nora Jones. I was just expecting something fresh. The promotional insert on TV certainly held some promise."
5,Smokin HOT. Thats right,Smokin' Hot For Men 4oz Deodorant SprayIts smokin hot and it smells like Armani Code
4,Cheap Price and great Smell.... :),"Nice deo,,, cheap price and smells great..... I recommend this product.... received some good comments on this. Pay less and get great smell...."
5,Loved it!,"I don't want to spoil anything, but I had the pleasure of reading this immediately after Hughes' novel enemy, the first in a trilogy. an end is the second in the trilogy and it one hell of a follow up to the first book. This novel is literary, intelligent and also an entertaining work of speculative fiction, a rare combination in such a novel. an end dances between the past, the future, and the present and the reader is never confused as to where they should be. I read this very quickly and I my mind was dancing as I read it, mentally stimulating. Nicely done."
1,Convoluted & Confusing!,"I am a great fan of serial science fiction. The first book in the series was okay, though not great. Still I ordered this follow-on. As the title says, it was convoluted and confusing. At points I thought maybe the Kindle version editing got incoherently scrambled. Anyway, the bottom line is I swore I would not waste money on the third book. Unfortunately after enough time had lapsed, I erroneously ordered the final book of the Silver Series. I read it simply because I didn't want to waste the money. It was an ordeal that was even worse than the second book!The premise of intertwined or alternative timelines involving recurrent characters is interesting, but the execution to make it coherent & enjoyable for the reader was dismal. Don't waste your money on this or the third book in the series."
1,Invisible Tape by Duck,"Disappointed with this product, inferior sticking properties .... I'm going back to Scotch Invisible tape, better quality."
3,"OK, But Like Scotch Tape Much Better","This Duck Brand Invisible Tape is not comparable toScotch Magic Refill Roll, 0.75 x 900 Inches (205-L)in quality, but the Duck Brand tape is MUCH less expensive. My son bought this for our shop and it is acceptable for most tasks, but not for signage on the retail floor since it is not as ""invisible"" as I would like.I do like that you can write on this tape with pen\pencil and that the matte finish is mostly non-reflective (important when taking pictures using a flash).This is a good value for daily use tape, but we will likely pay a little more for Scotch Brand going forward.CFH"
1,poor quality,"I mail out about 20 bubble mailer packages every day. I usually use Scotch tape to affix postage labels to the envelopes. I recently picked up Duck invisible matte tape by mistake, and boy was it a mistake! 2 envelopes got lost in transit because of the poor sticking quality of the tape. I know because I was able to track 1 package down, and the label was completely off. I knew right away when I tried using this tape that it could be an issue, but I thought I would give it a try since it is sold in major stores like Wal Mart. I am convinced that the only reason this stuff sticks at all is due to static! Stay far away from this company."
5,Just as good as Scotch tape...,I must not be a invisible tape connoisseur because this tape works just fine for everything I use it for unlike what other reviewers have said. I had Scotch brand tape prior to this and I can't tell a difference. It is costs less and works great. What more can I say?
2,WHAT is that SMELL???,"Case was a good fit for my Ovation, but it smelled HORRIBLE. I left it out in the sun and sprayed it with Fabreeze for 3 days and it still reeks!Smells like vomit and stale cigar smoke. YECH!"
4,Pulsar wristwatch,I really like the wristwatch.....but it came with a dead battery which I had to replace at my own expense.
1,Nice Concept - Bad Filter Fit Quality,I have used about six of these filtered water bottles. Three of thesix bottles had filters that were either not installed in the bottleprior to use (They were laying in the bottom of the unopened bottle).They were constantly falling out of the cap under regular usage. Theproblem appears to be sloppy manufacturing. The charcoal filter doesnot screw in. Rather it is just loosely pressed into the inner capnozzle. The water taste is good if and when the filter stays in place.
2,"Great idea, but...","Great concept that should help save plastic and money compared to buying regular bottled water, but one of my bottles came with an ill-fitting cap over the sports-top, which quickly became lost. And the taste of my tap water was not improved by the filter."
2,This kinda sucks,"The filter fell out the first time I filled it up for one of them, and it doesnt work anymore, do yourself a favor and just buy a brita pitcher and fill up another reusable water bottle."
4,Filtered travel size water bottle,I received this bottle just before I went on a cruise and it was very helpful.I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a small travel water bottle.
1,Not worth the money,"This was a waste of money. The bottle is extremely thin and flimsy. It also take a good amount of pressure to get the water out through the filter. Great idea, but over priced."
1,Waste of money,The bottle is so thin; it would never last a day with my 11 yr old daughter. Thought the filter took out chemicals; but only clorinde. Not worth the money.
1,Didn't like,"You have to squeeze the bottle to get the water out. It doesn't flow out like a regular throw away bottle. I didn't like it, threw mine out. Better off buying a washable water bottle that you can re use."
2,not so great,"The bottle itself is pretty flimsy and you have to squeeze pretty hard to drink from it - a good concept, but not sure it will hold up to 90 refills."
1,I So Wanted This To Work,"The idea of saving money and helping the enviorment seemed to be so alluring. I ordered four and they was delivered very fast. The problem is the bottle leaks. Each one has the same problem in that water leaks from the area where the cap screws onto the bottle. If I squeeze the bottle water comes out and drips all over the place. If I lay it on its side, I soon have a puddle of water. Great idea, poor execution."
3,Corn Bottle,"I really enjoy the idea of this bottle, but you have to squeeze the bottle hard to get the water out. When you do squeeze it appears particles from the filter go into the water. The store was excellent and this is not a reflection of their practices."
2,Mixed blessing,"I drink a lot of bottled water and have been trying various bottles to use with filtered water. This one is not the best for that application. There is a filter that removes chlorine from tap water -- a great thing if you care, which I don't. The filter really slows down the water, so you have to squeeze pretty hard to get other than a trickle."
2,Does it work??? I doubt it though nt sure,"I bought this bottle filter primarily to filter tap water for drinking while traveling to other cities.Find no change in taste though, hence not sure if it even works..."
5,Go to Amazon First,`A Piano: The Collection by Tori Amos arrived within days of ordering. The price was 50% less than other web sites I had tried. Now before I buy online I always try Amazon first! Thanks Amazon and keep up the good work.
5,Perfect for the Tori avid audience,"The packaging of this item is wonderful, along with the nice little book with comments straight from Tori about creating her albums and struggles with the record label etc. The songs are amazing. Some of them were subtley remixed and there are also some wonderful previously unreleased songs and versions of songs. I highly recommend this boxed set!"
5,Son Loved It,I brought for a gift for my son Tori is his favorite artist the packaging was very unique to
1,Stop it.,"I haven't bought this collection, and I won't.... I'd really like it if she'd stop releasing music in packages that cost upwards of $60. It's a bit ridiculous to ask anyone to pay so much for someone's ""new album."" Which it really isn't, of course, but there isn't enough new material here to merit the price. Next?"
1,y kant tori read?,"Nothing included from Tori's 1st CD ""Y Kant Tori Read."" Very disappointing. This would have been the IDEAL time to include some tracks from the long OOP CD!"
3,Meh...It's OK,I'm giving the box a 3 star rating but her music is a 5 star or more!I do love me some Tori. I love the design of the box set and I love that she goes into explaining how some of the songs came to be. I would have loved more details on more songs.I'm lovin some of the unreleased material but was disappointed to see that there weren't that many. I'm not sure what she was trying to do with this box set. It felt incomplete and unfocused but that's OK -- she's my girl and I have faith that there is much more artistry to come from this spectacular songwriter.
4,mmmmyea,"ok if yer reading this you're probably a fan..so you already know ginger's song-writing genius..this albumis very, very good..abit mellower than most of the wildhearts stuff, but the songs are great and some arejust plain fun(energetic O)...i really like this one..and if you're a fan you most definately want this foryour collection..hey L.!! love..."
5,a PERFECT PLACE TO BEGIN,"when I began my quest for macintosh knowledge many years ago, I bought this book. Then, I fell in love with the mac. Now, granted, the book is a tad dated, but the basics are there and one simply cant go wrong with this book as a starter. it will always hold a place of honor on my shelf. amy laskin should be commended for this work. YOU SHOULD READ IT! SHE DESERVES THE MONEY!"
1,"Not the ""Gasteiner"" sonata.",A nice CD but I can't find the Schubert sonata D.850 on it !It's actually the A Minor sonata D.845.
2,Sound quality is so bad.... Only watched it once....,Sound quality is so bad.... Only watched it once....I wish it has a better quality. Then i would rate it 5.
1,Don't be fooled: this ain't Jewish,"This guy has got some talent, no doubt...but don't be fooled. Jewish wrapping paper, Christian guts.Jews, stay away."
3,Don't purchase based on Beck's involvement alone,"I just purchased GET DOWN IN THE DIRT The Complete UPP(Import) - yes it's a bit spendy but there are some enjoyable elements in this set. I like Jazz Fusion and Funk, I'm also a huge Jeff Beck fan - don't purchase based on Beck's involvement alone. If you expect UPP to be comparable to `Blow By Blow' or `Wired' - you will be greatly disappointed... Buy only if you're a fan of Funk/Jazz Fusion or if you like the 70's Motown sound. If I had to do it over - I would have waited and bought a used copy..."
5,Inspiration in under 150 Pages,"This book is a wonderful gift for anyone needing a lift, including yourself. It is filled with unique quotes that are both humorous and inspirational. Not only will it make you think, but make you want to DO if you have your own vision you are trying to make a reality. The passages and quotes also come in handy at meetings and in newsletters if you want to add a little enlightenment! A great addition to your bookshelf, or to pass on!"
4,Pre-sleep guided imagery for kids,"My 8-year old daughter loved this book as much as I enjoyed sharing it with her. Each guided imagery began with ""Tonight would be a good night to imagine ... and the author would take the child on a gentle little journey before turning things over to God in prayer. My daughter loved slipping down into the covers and closing her eyes each night to imagine before we would pray. What kept it from 5 stars was the chronology of prayers. They were seasonal, so we were reading about Christmas in the summer. And there weren't enough of them! Give us more, Bernadette! Otherwise, we loved reading this book together!"
2,Sad,"Got this for a Halloween costume..... Not impressed. Unless you have super huge boobs I wouldn't buy. Well see how I can rig it up for Halloween, my father told me ""cute stockings"" lol good buy if your a stripper."
2,order not complete,I received the Garmin Delux Carrying Case. i did not receive the GPS Map that was supposed to be included
3,Too small for garmin with base,This is an OK item if you will be carrying your StreetPilot around without the dashboard base. It is way too small to carry anything but the garmin itself. It also was too small to carry the power cord for the car.
1,"No padding, no protection","Unlike other Garmin products, including carry cases, this one is beyond cheap...it is useless. It has a built-in plastic tray in the bottom but absolutely no padding. A medium sized camera bag would be far better."
4,Wish it was a little bigger,I wish it was a little bigger so it would fit the dash-board mount easier
3,Carrying case review,"This carrying case is adequate, nothing special but worth the $, just to have someplace to hide the unit as needed."
2,CHECK THE SIZE BEFOE YOU BUY!,"Make SURE you see how SMALL this item is before you buy. This carrying case is teeny-tiny and barely holds my Street Pilot 2820. Forget about it holding any of the accessories, such as the XM antenna, cassette tape audio feed for the XM, or anything else you can buy. Yes, the size was listed there, but the photos are deceiving."
1,Garmin Carrying Case,This case is much too small. It does not hold everything you need so therefore it's kind of useless.
1,ridiculously small,This bag is so small that it is useless. It only fit the GPS unit and nothing more. You cannot put the base and cables in it - there is no space.
4,Garmin carry most,"This bag is well made and works great with the streetpilot 7120. I can carry the unit, power cable, screen cleaners and misc small items. The reason It only got 4 stars is there is no way to cary the weighted dash bean bag in the bag. This is mostly a small inconvenience but I felt it worth the mention."
5,A handy carrying case for a Garmin StreetPilot,"I purchased this case for use with a Garmin StreetPilot c330, and it has worked out very well. The bottom of the case is lined with hard plastic to protect the GPS. Its not super roomy, but I find that there is just enough room to carry all of the necessary equipment (GPS, mounting device for windshield, cigarette lighter adapter, and USB cable. My only minor beef with this case is the fact that there is no padding for extra protection. To solve this, I cut an old flannel pillow case in half and wrap it around the GPS unit when its not in use. This seems to work out quite well."
3,Garmin 010-10231-01 Deluxe Carry Case for StreetPilot,Wish the case was a little larger as there is not enough room to get the StreetPilot and accessories in the case. Find I don't use it except to store the StreetPilot.
1,Carrying Case,I ordered this for my Garmin 2720 - it does not fit....what a piece of junk and it's not worth more than $5!
3,Too Small,"I bought this carrying case to carry the mobile components of our StreetPilot GPS so as to conveniently protect it when moving it from car to car or storing it. The case does a fine job of holding the GPS but will not hold the 12-volt power/speaker cable, remote control and beanbag mount all at the same time. Disappointing!"
3,Decent,"It is a bit small, and I can't fit the remote in with everything else, but this beats the plastic supermarket bag I used to carry this thing to and around L.A."
1,"Small, little, tiny, inadequate in size, and not big enough","Garmin deluxe carrying case is ""Big"" disappointment. Way too too small to accommodate anything other than the Garmin StreetPilot GPS Navigator. Save $25 and buy a ""small"" size Sears tool bag. Cost $2.99 and holds the StreetPilot, Dash Mount (MANDATORY option) cellphone, sunglasses, and wallet. Plus it reads Sears and not Garmin (aka steal Me please). Bottom line is the Garmin Deluxe carrying bag is ok for the Nuvi, but not the StreetPilot and Dash Mount. Ironically, as poor as the Garmin carrying case is ... the opposite is true of the Garmin Dash Mount; which cost about the same as the little bag. So, forget the bag and spend your money on the Garmin Dash Mount and a $2.99 Sears ""small"" tool bag. The good new is that you will love the Dash Mount for the Garmin StreetPilot 5 Stars, 5 Diamonds. Buy it (Garmin Dash Mount) through Amazon and enjoy."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I love my Garmin Nuvi 760 and I travel often so I wanted a bag to hold the Garmin Nuvi, the friction mount (bean bag like mount), the wires and the suction mount. This bag could not even store the Nuvi without issue and the wires wouldn't fit either. Why Garmin does not offer a bundle package of carrying bag and case is beyond me. If you have a small unit, this bag may be ok for you to store your GPS only. If you have a 4.3 inch screen GPS and want to pack your wires and accessories up too, don't waste your money on this tiny bag!"
2,took over a month to deliver,I ordered this product January 3rd and I just received it yesterday. Amazon claims that this product was returned back to them. I cancelled my order and a month later they send it to me.......... THe product is okay but at this point I do not even want it......... Check with amazon to make sure your product is delivered.......
3,Garmin shame!,This is a so-so product (does not match current photo). SMALL and not much room for the price. This should be $10 -$15 and no more; you'd be better off with an alternate item!!!
5,Practical and safe,"The carrying case is very useful, practical, everything fits in it. Since it's compact sized, it fits in the car's compartments, or in your bag. The bottom is semi-rigid, which is a real helper to fit the streetPilot and accessories in the case, while assuring a better safety for the items."
2,"Too Small, Not Functional",This item is smaller then the listed measurements and barely can hold the unit and cords. It is so small it isn't really functional. Not worth the money.
5,Must have if...,"This is a must have if you have a Garmin, since you never want to leave it in your car. Everything fits in nicely, and make it easy to carry in and out."
5,good carry case,it was a good purchase.i did not want to leave the navigator in the car when i left.this is very conveniant and holds more than i thought.
2,Too small to be useful,"GPS fits into the bag, but not all the paraphenalia you need to carry along with it. Better to by a camera gadget bag."
5,Great Garmin C550 Carrying Case,"This carrying case is perfect for my Garmin C550. I still use the case that came with the GPS to protect the lens and store it along with the charger in this case with handles. The case is a little smaller than the one that Avis and Budget uses for their rental C550 Garmins, but it is big enough for my needs."
3,Remarkable,"What is remarkable is how small this case is for such a big price. If you want a case to hold your 2720, beanbag mount, remote control, and cigar lighrer adapter/speaker...this is not it. Simply too small.Instead, go find yourself a nice camcorder case. I found a $15 one at a Meijer stare on closeout for $4 and it amply holds all these things. Something garmin's $25 case cannot hope to do.Dumb product, unless you just want to protect the base unit and nothing else."
4,"garmin, gps carrying case for Model 760 & Street Pilot 7200 with acessories",Small for Garmin 760 with acessories and inadequate for Garmin Street Pilot 7200 with acessories. I used two (2) bags for Garmin 760 with acessoeies.
1,Street Pilot Mismatch,"Garmin Deluxe Carrying Case for StreetPilot and GPSMap 176 (010-10231-01) systemsThis is a great carrying case, just not for the Street Pilot. It is way to small!!"
5,Perfect little case,The unit just fits into the case. I like the smallness of it - easy toput on the car floor to hid from spying eyes. Great product.
2,Lacks padding,Expected some padding to protect a sensitive and expensive touch-screen device. Had to add a bit of foam myself. This is just a plain case that barely fits my Streetpilot 330.
1,Garmin carry bag,Bag was returned for refund. Bag dimensions were not as described on website. Reccomend revising website description to properly reflect dimensions of the bag.
1,Disappointing & Overpriced,I was expecting something better from Garmin for my $20. I'd rather have bought a small-sized camera bag (i.e. Mountainsmith Focus II) that would hold and protect my Nuvi 760 and then some.
1,bag,the delux bag is not made for the Streetpilot 7200. that should be said in your ad. would not have ordered it
1,too small - not worth it,The bag is too small - GPS hardly fits there and any mount and anything else will not fit
4,Good,"Good case for you Garmin GPS. Well built and has pockets for accessories. Not a LARGE case, so be forewarned."
4,Very Satisfied,The only thing that I would like even more would be if it had an extra pocket to put the cord or extras.
4,carrying case,I felt the case was a bit snug when all the plugs and window bracket was put inside. Otherwise good.
2,Not what i expected,"This item arrived and it was not quite what i expected. Since this was the deluxe case, I expected it to be a decent size. It's about the size of a man's hand. It's tiny - and since it is supposed to be able to hold any accessories you buy for the garmin - I can't imagine how small the garmin and its accessories are. Made me rethink the whole thing - but since it was a gift for my dad and my mum had bought the garmin, not me - well, it wasn't my choice. I'd possibly go to the store and check it out before you order it online."
1,Too Small,"The case is too small for the Street Pilot 2610. When I travel I need the Street Pilot and the cord to plug into the lighter. also need the ""sand bag"". It won't fit. Buy a bigger case."
1,TOO small FOR GARMIN C330 UNIT,"This bag is fairly well made. Here's the problem - which has been detailed in numerous other reviews. IT IS A LITTLE TOO small.It fits the unit (barely) but forget any accessories, such as the USB cable, and no way will it hold the bean bag mount. The bean bag is the same size as this carrying bag, so it won't fit in it.Price a Kodak camera bag or a Samsonite camcorder bag - for about the same price you get a better bag, with more padding and some compartments, so you can carry your GPS and its accessories and a few other things (a digital camera or your wallet or cell phone)."
1,Deluxe Carrying Case is NOT deluxe,"The carrying case is so ridiculously small that it barely fits the Garmin Street Pilot, let alone the cord and any accessories. When you pay over $400 for a piece of delicate equipment you 1) expect to get a case with it or worst case 2)have the ability to purchase a case that truly protects the device and isn't a cheesy piece of junk. Garmin should be ashamed."
2,Good news & bad news,"I wish I had read the reviews here before following the manufacturer's claim, which was reprinted in the product description on Amazon. The good news is that it's well made. The bad news is that, contrary to the claim that it holds all your GPS cables, brackets, and the unit itself, it's only good for carrying or storing the GPS unit itself. Also, the price is excessive considering that it doesn't do as claimed. Do yourself a favor - and spare yourself some disappointment while saving some money - take your GPS to an electonics store (CompUSA, Best Buy, etc.) and buy a good padded camera bag which will hold everything for about 2/3 the price."
3,Comets On Fire kicks-out the jams,"Right from the opening track, Comets On Fire paves the way for frenzied MC5 garage-rock, aggressive jams and psychadelic grooves. In terms of sound, 'Blue Cathedral' combines the fierce guitar-power of Guitar Wolf, the soul-punk of The Constantines and Hawkwind's space-flights. This CD captures the spirit of the Detroit garage-rock scene, reckless energy, bone-shattering rhythms that would make Rob Tyner and Fred Sonic Smith proud. Just press play, hold on to your seat, and be prepared to take-off."
5,some of the best psychadelic noise rock out there right now,"when i had first heard blue cathedral, or cof for that matter, my friend was playing the cd in his car with emphasis on the more ""crazy"" tracks on the album. i admit at first i wasn't taken by the notion of psychadelic, it just seemed like noise rock. interested, later on he let me listen to more of the album and i had fallen in love with it.i dont want to go into depth here, all i can say is, if your into the neo-psychadelic movement going on in music, or just plain out like noise rock, than this album is very worth getting, especially for the last song, blue tomb. its one of my alltime favorite songs at the moment and if this whole album blew, i'd still buy it for that song alone.also, if you were to start getting into comets on fire, i'd strongly recommend listening to avatar before this one, the ladder is lot more ""easy"" to listen to."
4,hey moron,r. hillary.if you are going to trash the band at leats get there name right.THE BAND IS CALLED COMETS ON FIRE. not blue cathedral. funny that you bought this album yet dont knwo the bands name
5,This is good stuff!,I got this album last weekend and haven't stopped listening to it since. It's a really beautiful densely textured and varied psychedelic rock album. 45 minutes is just the right length for any album. Too many bands make 70 minute albums just because they can when they haven't got enough tunes to fill it. This one really leaves you wanting more and more until it makes you go deaf. It's the most rockin' album I've heard in a few years. If you don't like this you don't exist. I agree with anyone who says good things about it.Comparing this band to the Darkness is just criminal.play it loud!Comets on Fire rock!
2,A real drag,"I read on the pitchfork reviews that this is apparently ""the next summer barbeque album"". Lets put it this way...if you put this cd on at a barbeque, it'll be taken right out after the first song, and you won't be allowed to touch the boombox ever again."
5,One Of The Best Asian Style Albums Ever Created,"If you are looking for the best Asian style music in the world, you have come to the right place. Himekami is a master, weaving his poetry with sound. You should own this, and Moonwater as well, for it is equally excellent."
3,great cd....but,how can you put together such a great collection of songs and then absolutely destroy one of the best 10cc songs?....feel the benefit is classic 10cc then u master it at a horribly slow speed...very dissapointed...destroyed the whole cd
2,Money for god sake.........,"10cc is my favourite pop group and I love their music especially in the early years. And many of my friends, many new ones, begin to discover the music of 10cc and would like to hear and read more. Then GG06 and Eric and Lol still make excellent music, some you can listen on this new CD and some from their uge musicgalleries. I knew 10cc, G&C; and also GG06 - early years - as "" art for art sake....""Then Universal makes this bad CD..some hits like ""Feel the Benefit"" a smash 10cc-hit is bad recorded, some like the new excellent ""[...]"" is an edited version!!? by GG06. And more..and no information about 10cc history...So thats why I give 2 star. ...Money for gods sake. /Ricce"
4,Not as bad as you think,"I have had this phone for 15 months now. I am still on my first battery, I have never had reception problems (Alltel) and the easiest way to cure everyones camera problems is enable the passcode feature for the camera. When you enable the passcode feature you have to enter a 4 digit code to gain access to the camera which eliminates the accidental camera useage and battery rundown. I am a truckdriver and my only complaint is that the ringer could be louder, but in a car it is fine. When the phone has a full charge I can use it for more than a day before it goes dead, and I use it quite often. I am satisfied and would purchase it again."
1,If you buy this phone GET INSURANCE!,"I have had this phone less than a year. I have had it replaced two times so far and have, the whole time I have owned it, not had a full month of this phone working properly. Right out of the box the first time it had speaker problem and did not ring. The next time people would call me and not be able to hear me, but I could hear them. The main reason I picked it was because it has a camera.The camera could be better, but for the price, is not too bad. The phone does go through power very quick. Any day I talk on it I have to charge it.Although I have had many tech problems with this phone, it seems to be strong physically, nothing on it has broken, including the screen on the front. It also has a nice sized color screen.So if you buy this phone, just make sure you keep up the insurance and keep track of your warrenty info because it will need to be replaced."
4,"Great phone, easy to use.","I love the phone. The main display is big and colorful, and the external display shows more info than I would have thought. The camera's low quality, but that's standard for a phone. My only gripe is the external camera button. It's a ""feature"", but it's too easy to hit it accidentally."
1,Not worth the headache,"Like other users, I've been pretty dissatisfied with this phone. Battery is eaten up by the picture button being pushed accidentally. I'm on my third one now. I know...What do I keep going back for? They keep dying for no apparent reason. Current one won't charge without forcing charger into port, which is the only reason I stick with this model - so I don't have to replace accessories too. Alternatives from Verizon were horrible - $90 for a phone you can buy on ebay for $20? I just think if a company pushes these phones on you, they should back them up better."
1,faulty phone,I just got this phone and the battery held a charge at for the first month but will now only hold a charge for 12 minutes!! I found several other customers on the internet that also had this phone and had bad batteries. I feel that Verizon is selling a phone that is faulty. Am having troubles with Verizon giving me a new phone... Try to avoid this one if you can.
4,Works for Me!,"I recently switched from AT&T to Verizon Wireless and I read multiple mixed reviews about this phone before I purchased it, many of them bad. I still purchased the phone and I am quite satisfied with it. I don't think any phone will be perfect, but this phone performs all the basic and regular functions just fine. The reception with this phone is fantastic, but I am not sure how much reception has to do with the phone or the area in which you are calling from. I really like my new service with Verizon and my new Audiovox phone-I recommend both!"
2,i hate it good bad and the ugly-not a kid-24,good:it calls peoplecameraflash(useless)bad:terrible camerauseless flashvery quietlow ringer volumeweak vibratebad batterypeople laughed when had it and pulled it outugly:this could not be any uglierextremely fatbad plasticundurablecheaply put togetherscratchs easilybad color designdid i mention how i was laughed at when people saw it thats because its very hideousi know that i dont have this any more but it sucked for the duration. now that i have a samsung a850 people looked impressed with it and i get more compliments while people see it. if you want a cheap camera phone i warn you. go to the samsung a850. the picture quality is amazing and it is rather small. it looks alot better is skinnier costs around the same the ringers are better looking no verizon on the front lcd really just an all around better phone in all aspectshowever if you want a cheap camera phone that is ugly fat undurable then go to the 8910
1,Brand new,"I got this phone less than a month ago and it's already broken. Everytime I lose service (which is often) it turns off and back on. It also turns off and back on whenever I get a phone call, text message or try to call or text someone. I haven't gotten it wet or dropped it, it's just a terrible phone.The flash on the camera goes off AFTER the picture is already taken and is pointless.I would never recommend it to anyone."
2,This phone sucks,I've had my phone for a year now and I've had it replaced 3 times already. I've had problems with this phone since I first got it. The ringer volume is low and so is the call volume. I have to take the battery off and put it back on to make calls sometimes and once it kept restarting itself over and over again. The battery is useless and my friends constantly complain that about the fact that I can't talk on my phone for more than 10 minutes. It's ugly after a while and the camera takes crappy pictures.The only good thing I can say about the phone is that it was cheap. So if u want a cheap camera phone with low quality pictures that you'll constantly need to replace this is great for you.
1,Horrible Phone,"I have had many Verizon phones and this is this is the worst by far. The Reception is HORRIBLE, the Camera sucks, and it scratches too easily. I had cingular for a while but there reception sucked even when combined with ATT, so I switched to Verizon, who has the best reception Nationwide. But this phone makes them seem like a joke. I have had dropped calls even when I have had 4 and 5 Bars. I now have a Treo witch is the best, and I acctally have reception with it. Though I did with my other phones too. I would Recommend Verizon to all, but if you get them DON'T get this Phone."
1,Are we talking about the same phone?,"This is the worst phone I have ever used. I was a long term sprint customer but figured I would switch to Verizon about a week ago. I get a 22% employee discount so I thought I would switch. After reading reviews on the Audiovox CDM8910, I thought I would get an amazing phone. First off this phone is not user friendly. If you want to use the phone outside, forget about it. The screen turns black in the sun. The camera quality is terrible. The ring tones are horrible and very limited. Plus, there are no games, not even plain old freecell. I almost wish I had my old school LG phone, it may have been basic but at least it was easy to use. So beware of some of these reviews about how great this phone is. Or do what I did and buy the phone just to exchange it for something better."
1,TERRIBLE,I've had many cell phones but this one has to be the worst! It scratches so easily its not even funny. I transfered from cingular last december and that was the worst decision of my life. I could stand next to someone who was a different carrier and 99% of the time i'll have less service bars then he or she. You get what you pay for and this phone is a clear example of that.
5,Great phone,"I have done a lot of review checking on other phone manufacturers and this one had the best ratings with alot of nice features. I wanted to upgrade from my Nokia 3390 mainly because I was always hitting the keypad and dialing out. Otherwise it was a great phone with excellant service and reception. I hope this Audiovox won't let me down. The screen its great and easy to view along with the ease of accessing the menu. They list it as not having voice dialing, but it does. I had found this out from a friend before ordering it. The quality of the camera is not the best, but typical for a camera phone. The location of the camera button on the side is the only real complaint I have about the phone. It is too easily hit while talking on the phone. The reception is great and I'm hoping the service is too. I liked T-Mobile and hated to switch. If you're looking for a nice flip phone, this is it!"
2,Beware,"I got this phone about six months ago, and it's been a disappointment since day one.The ringer is very quiet- I can almost never hear it ring! Not only is the ringer quiet... the whole phone is quiet. I often have difficulty hearing the person on the other end, even with the volume turned up as loud as it can go.The flash doesn't do anything for the phone, so don't buy it just because there's a flash.The thing that really bothers me about this phone, though, is the battery. I can charge it for well over 24 hours, and the battery dies after an hour of conversation.My sister also has this phone, and she shares my dislike for it. She had her phone replaced within a few months of buying it because the phone wouldn't hold a charge. Just recently, her replacement phone started doing the same thing. She recieved yet another replacement phone last week... we'll see how well that works out for her."
1,"Bad, Bad Little Phone","After buying this phone new in August:Pictures are fuzzy and not clear at all, no matter how close you are. The ringer is very quiet on the loudest ring, so if you want to either miss a lot of calls or not hear anything out of your phone, it's a good one to get. Also, because my husband and I both bought the same phone, we noticed that both of them are starting to have connection problems where you charge the phone, it has come loose on the inside. It's only a matter of time before we can't use either of them. I have another cellular phone that is Motorolla, and I stand behind that one. This one is junk."
4,Why 'classical',"Rosewynde's other two releases are listed under 'popular', and both show the artist as 'Rosewynde'. This one does neither. It would probably sell better if it was easier to find.The other two albums also offer free MP3 downloads - this one does too, but not from the amazon.com site.Some good tunes here, so a shame it is hidden away, and that a search for 'Rosewynde' won't turn it up."
3,It's not a docking station :-(,"This is not the most useful device I have purchased, my intention being that of having few cables to plug/unplug from my Qosmio G25 when I move it, alas with this device I will still have to plug in the USB cable, plus find my charger and plug that into wall and computer . . . Toshiba could have done better."
4,review from 10 year old boy,"Although I like the overall design, I have been encountering performance problems such as graphic details--the screen flashes in different sections with horizontal and vertical bars--and running problems such as the game tries to connect on the internet although I'm not playing on the internet, so it just shuts down."
2,Very disappointed.,"Microsoft Games has proven they can make excellent RTS games. My two favorite RTSes, Age of Empires 2 and Rise of Nations, were built by them.Like many, I bought this game because I adored Rise of Nations. I knew it'd be different, but, wow, I did not expect this. The gameplay is completely different. The removal of gathering different types of resources is discouraging. The three teams are relatively uninspired. Graphically, it's beautiful, but great gameplay is infinitely superior to good graphics.The game is not inherently bad, but it isn't very good, especially considering all of Microsoft Game's potential and the high expectations for this game."
3,read this before you get this game!!!!!,"Ok I bought this game about five hours ago and downloaded it and I was dissapointed that I couldn't play it because i got twice as much of the requirements but, I needed a graphics acceleration card so I haven't gotten to play it so I gave it a three."
5,"great game, can get a little challenging","I extremely enjoyed this game and I think anyone reading this will too. the graphics are incredible, you can see every detail. i am a great lover of fantasy games and have every game from starcraft to star wars. When this came out I needed to see what it was like and now I can't stop playing it. The chalenges on campaign mode are tough even on easy, but they are fun. I love the creatures in the game and how they look on the computer. I enjoy playing this game and using all of the 3 civilizations. I definatly reccomend this game!"
2,"Microsoft, It's Time To Move On","I really wanted to give this game a chance. I really did. It looked very nice visually in the screenshots released. But unfortunately there was an utter failure to deliver. The concept of one single linked city was nice. I'll give it that. However, the core mechanics of the game (units etc) were horrible. I would have to say they were even less creative than those of some of microsofts older games such as Age of Empires etc. So in addition to the game mechanics feeling clunky, they also felt outdated.Basically, overall, the story wasn't that good, the units were uninteresting to say the least, and given the multitude of other options, and I really wish I could have had those hours back."
1,Hate It,"This game is so different from the original they shouldn't share the same name. I still enjoy playing Rise of Nations and Rise of Legends is a different game in every aspect. I found playing it was too easy and there were no choices to be made by the player, just a singular story line to follow that was quite lame. Don't buy this game expecting it to be a newer version of Rise of Nations, it's something completely different."
2,This is a good game for $20...no more.,"I am a fan of the Rise of Nations game...in fact, if you have never played the game, don't buy this game...buy Rise of Nations & the expansion pack for nothing...MUCH BETTER GAME.Graphics mean something the first 10 seconds...after that, game play is imo the most important thing and this game just did not do much for me.In fact, after the first 3 levels I felt like I got ripped off and the this game was simply marketed to be bought by suckers like myself that love Rise of Nations and would buy this game just because.Wait until the price goes down if you really want the game...the only thing you will be missing is the extra $$$ in your wallet that you will be missing after playing the game."
2,Big step backwards from RoN,"If, like me, you loved Rise of Nations, and wanted the next great game from Big Huge Games, you will be very disappointed with Rise of Legends. Game strategy and elements are not well thought out. There is not an intruiging technology advancement timeline. And the game control mechanics are not as clean. I recommend trying the free download scenario first before spending your real money and time on this game."
3,"Awesome game, unfinished","This game is absolutely astounding, from a fully orchestrated emotional soundtrack to the starts of memorable characters. The teams play well off of each other.Unfortunately this game seems to be incomplete and unpolished. Almost like an executive said 'wrap it up, it goes gold next week'. An entire race has been cut from the final game, and the vestiges can be seen in the files if you dig deep.This game is still very impressive and fun today, but recognize that it's unpolished and content was cut, and adjust your expectations accordingly.If there was an expansion pack that brought it back to the full scope it was originally, I'd buy it."
5,This one is a must have,The grahics and playability of this game are outstanding. You have to carefully choose you upgrades to move from scenario to scenario. The game is always challenging but can be a bit difficult in the early stages of a new campaign.
1,Hair polish,This was a great price & great product but shipping service was terrible. By the time i recieved the box all the bottles had spilled about 25% out of each bottle .i feel cheated
5,Huge bottles,"I wasn't expecting the bottles to be so huge. It's quite good for the price. I love this product. I will definitely buy from this seller just because the bottles were big. The product is good already, so just try it if you haven't."
2,Frequent price increases and false claims of quantity.,"This is a good product that is over-priced, over-hyped and under-serviced.It comes nowhere near their claim of charging 110 liters of water from one charger. If you were to try to get 110 liters of soda water from their claimed 110 liter charger, it would be so flat you could barely call it soda water.And, once you have made the substantial investment, you are a captive audience for their service, which includes frequent price increases.The ability to exchange CO2 bottles locally is very iffy. It seems to be different every time. Last time, I had to have the bottle shipped to me. This time, their site claims local exchanges, but the places claimed as exchange locations on their site seem not to have the same information.If they were upfront and honest about the cost and convenience of their product, I would give it four or five stars."
4,cool grooves,"I had the great good fortune of being Kevin Setchko's house mate in college and spent many evenings jamming, singing, learning each other's songs and befriending other musicians in a circle of music. It's refreshing to see how he has matured and how widespread his talent is across keyboards, guitar, flutes. He has gathered around him several great musicians and made a fine ensemble. the pity is that Crystal Wind is no more a band. buy these two albums and groove along."
2,Needs more work.,"I agree there are problems with this book, but the section that has the baskets is very beautiful. That part was my favorite. I agree that better research could have been done on the weavers themselves, but the baskets make this book a beautiful addition just on the baskets themselves. I know what the other reviewers are talking about and sometimes it can be frustrating that such things have been done, but the photos of the baskets and basket work is great."
1,"Finally, someone had the courage to say it.","Great review, Walter! Finally, someone has said what a lot of us Indians were thinking.Sure the book is packed with a lot of fabulous photos, but the context of the book is so flawed. I am surprised Yosemite Park Service approved this book.The book is so inaccurate I was wondering why both of the authors could do this, but then again the Southern Miwoks are going for recognition. They needed books like this printed. It could be possible that is why this book was done. It now makes a lot of sense why someone would do a book so filled with inaccurate information. Best to check this book out of the library and just look at the nice pretty pictures, because the ""historical"" info is inaccurate."
1,Bad Battery and Poor Service,I just received the camera as a gift and the battery doesn't work. I am advised to send the battery in to a service center along with a letter describing the problem and copy of the invoice. It will take about a month for the center to respond. This is an expensive product where you would expect good service but don't!
1,This is a non-camera,"This camera [...]. When it takes a picture, it has about a 2 second delay between when you press the shutter and the picture is actually taken. This means that the camera is not at all useful to take pictures of our 2 year old son, because 2 seconds later he has already moved on to something else and the picture is a blur. We have lost more pictures because of this camera.Tonight when trying to take our Christmas picture, I would press the shutter but no picture was taken. It was as if the camera could not figure out what it had to do. Try again, same result. Repeat, nothing. Repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, still nothing. When I set the camera down, disgusted that it wasn't taking any pictures, then flash! - took a nice picture of the pavement. Notice that I hadn't pressed the shutter for this picture.I am in the market for another digital camera and am likely not going to get a Sony."
1,shutter button problem,"I owned this camera for several years. The first year it worked fine and I was happy with its performance. In the past year, I 've become completely dissatisfied with it. I always took good care of it, following the instruction manual. I first started to have power problems, the battery would not charge or would quickly discharge. Purchased a new one and now the shutter button does not work. It only goes down to the auto-focus mode but no to the record mode. I contacted Sony tech support and they tell me this is an unknow problem. Right! and I was born yesterday. Their only help was take it to a repair center."
1,Disappointment!,I was thouroughly disappointed with this camera. There was an artefact on the pictures taken towards sunlight and the lensprotector did not always open properly. I had it exchanged but the above two problems reoccured. Now after having had the camera for only 9 months the it is completely unusable due to power problems. I wouldn't recommend a sony camera to anyone even if it is stylish and GREAT when it does work.
2,Problems with Shutter after 2 months.,"I bought this camera Dec 4. I loved the size and the durable look and feel. It is a camera you can take anywhere. And the pictures are very good.That said, my shutter button now jams up in the up position, so shots cannot be taken. It seems like a mechanical problem with the shutter mechanism and the mode dial. After playing with the mode dial back and forth, the button freed up. Now it freezes up every few shots. It seems to be related to the feature that keeps the shutter from being depressed while the mode dail is in playback or setup modes.So far their service is dismal, with a maze of menus and long hold times (half hour). I am very disappointed after an initial great product experience."
3,dsc p5,"I got this camera last month. I chose it, because it is pretty small and 3.2 megapixel. Here are my comments: Advantages:Small, 3.2 megapixel, zoom is goodDisadvantages:you will need a large capacity memory stick and a spare battery is necessary. It is not great at night shots. It is not fast when you are taking photos, i mean yo gotta wait like at leat 2 seconds to take another shot. Even dsc p71 is faster."
5,Excellent camera,Excellent camera with most features that is really fits in the pocket. For this price Sony should include storage of 64MB or even 128MB. Selling this camera with 8MB of memory is like selling a 911Turbo with a 5 gallon gas tank.I wonder why Sony is sticking with a storage format that is non-standard for the industry now... a little like Betamax here. A camera case with spare battery should have been included as well since the camera does not accept AA batteries.The lettering that comes on both LCD displays are hard to read depending on the lighting... could be improved.Ajit.
5,The iPod Book: Doing Cool Stuff with the iPod and the iTunes Store,Great book! I never knew the iPod was so versatile. A must read!
3,Not a whole lot new here,This book is great for the novice user. Lots of good info and easier to use than the Apple website I think. If you are looking for a lot of inside info and hot tips it's not here.
2,Very superficial!,"This is only for the super novice. I was very disappointed. He tells you to back up your iTunes on CD's, for example, which is stupid. Backing up on DVD's is much, much faster, preserves the name tags, and is the only way to go. Skimpy on the playlist section, and too much of his ""aren't I clever"" small talk. Not worth it."
2,Disappointed. Could be better,"While book may seem like it would appeal to beginners, I think it is more suited to someone who is familiar with the iPOD. There is a wealth of information in the book, but the book does not have all the answers. It's advice in problem solving is limited. Example: A couple of procedures in the book showing how to use the iTunes did not work. This left us searching through the iTunes help pages instead. Example: On the page for iTunes gift certificates (194), it does not tell you where or how on the iTunes page to do this. Yes, simple stuff now, but frustrating for a first time user left floundering around in iTunes."
4,Helpful for the 1st time user,"Reading through the book before I first tried to use my iPod made all the difference in the world - both from a comfort level and saving time during the first few days. Since then, some of my issues were resolved, but some do not seem to be addressed in the book, although I've found answers elsewhere. For instance, I listen to audiobooks, but found that when I would turn on the iPod, my place in the book was not saved and I had to relisten to segments to get back to the right point. Logging into iTunes and looking at their online help gave me my answer - press the wheel's middle and you get a way to navigate within chapters. So, if you have never used an iPod before, this book will help orient you - although you may need other resources for troubleshooting."
5,A 'bible' that any iPod user (whether owners of shuffle nano or other) with any type of computer - Mac or PC - must have,"If only a few iPod books were to be chosen for a general lending collection, the third updated edition of THE IPOD BOOK by Scott Kelby simply must be one of them. It focuses on the important features of all ipods and the itunes store, uses a quick visual approach to demonstrate topics, and provides tutorials on everything from exporting and organizing a playlist to handling iPod freezes. It's a 'bible' that any iPod user (whether owners of shuffle nano or other) with any type of computer - Mac or PC - must have."
5,A Must Have For The IPod Owner,"Having received my 20GB iPod last Christmas, I wanted an easy way to do things such as do bulk changes in iTunes of existing playlists. I didn't know how until I read this book. I enjoyed his writing and have found myself to now have mastered the iPod. Now I'm organized in my iPod, something I thought would take much longer."
3,Where is my bib?,"This book is not unlike eating cracked crab. If you have the patience to get past the frustration of the shells the meat is probably very good. I am about 4 times the age of 13. This is the 3rd time I have found time and patience to sit down with my iPod and this book. Once again my frustration has derailed me and I find myself sitting here writing a review about it. We start the book with ""skip to chapter 2"" I do so and have to read a bunch of nonsense about the one-hit wonders, The Outsiders. I keep reading because I was referred to this chapter. I am not amused. I quote, ""That's right you have to read another chapter intro..blah, blah blah."" Oops I'm out of patience and time again, I return the book and the iPod to the drawer. I need to find a less wannabe-witty manual writer than Scott-probably-loved-the-Raspberries Kelby."
5,The iPod Book,This book is really a help with the iPod. It has really made a difference on using all the features of the iPod.
2,not enough for your money,"I was really disappointed in this book. If you expect to find out new interesting things for ipod, or how to trouble shoot if you have problems, this is not the book. Can't believe I paid $20 for this!"
1,not much help,"There is very little information in this book. It is fattened up with a lot of irrelevent filler: long boring ""jokes"" & anecdotes."
2,Not for beginners,"Although the book was said to be for novices like me, I was totally confused and not able to get any benefit from the book. I am a new iPod owner and am still not able to use it. Guess I should have ordered the ""iPod for Dummies book, because this too technical to be of any help to me."
1,I want my money back,"I want my money back and sadly, I paid full price at the Apple store. It seems whenever I try to learn how to do something which seems fairly simple,this book either doesn't cover the topic, covers the topic, but doesn't tell me how to do it correctly, or when I do what it says, nothing happens.There needs to be an instruction manual more detailed than what Apple provides, and less esoteric than this book."
5,Great starter book,"Great book, if you never had an Ipod before. Covers the basics simply and easily. If you have any basic questions, buy this book USED, get some great tips, and be ahead of the game with the tips from the book and not the cost of a new book."
5,Excellent book,"I bought this book after seeing it in a Circuit City. I was kicking myself because I didn't buy it right then, I went home, ordered it off of Amazon and I love this book!!! I ordered it for my parents and sister as well and they love it too. It is a simple, well laid out book with a lot of humor and very easy to read. I like the pictures because I am a visual learner. Usually I don't like all the ""tech junk"" but my 12 year old daughter and I learned a lot about our IPOD's with this book. It is a great book and I like the fact that it is an easy read with straight forward ""fixes"" I am sure that some of this stuff is in an owners manual, but who wants to read that and try to figure out what they are talking about when you can get right to the point? GREAT BOOK!!!"
2,Just OK,"This book could have been more helpful if the author had kept his attempt at humor down to a dull roar and actually explain things a little more clearly. In the end, I just called itunes and figured stuff out on my own."
1,A waste of time,"Pointless. There's absolutely nothing in the book that can't easily be found in the on-line manual. Luckely, I borrowed it at the library. Don't waste your money on this. Kelby has written a couple of good books (and some really bad ones too), this is not one of them."
3,IPod book,I really found some of the information in this book very helpful. It has left some things out though. Most things were found in this book.
4,Kitty Gone Wild,"My cat loves this video, especially the birds and pigeons. The fish scenes don't seem to enthrall him as much - the fish move too slowly. The crystal clear bird sounds as they feed on the fallen tree in the first section really get him going. He crouches low and waits for a bird to perch motionless for a moment, then he lunges up and plants his paws on them. I'm going to have to get my cat an old-style CRT TV or some sort of screen protector ... I'm a little afraid for my soft LCD."
1,Horrible! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!,This was the worst training video I have ever seen...Only about 15 -20 minutes long about stuff a 8 yr old would already know! Im soooo mad I bought this!
2,Garmin eTrex Instructional Video,Awful!!!A very short and superficial instructional video.Dont buy it. Read the instruction book that came with it.
3,thought it would be better,"i have to recommend some of the mid career Laughing Hyenas records. the formula of ""Friends of Rock n Roll"" is found all over the old hyenas stuff, and those visceral vocals are perfected by their 2nd and 3rd records. so in short, this record isn't very good as a whole."
1,One Cop's Story,"I lived in Nedrow during the time John served in LaFayette. I had some encounters with troopers and almost expected to see a story about myself in there, but was relieved when I didn't make it. John was a good cop, but not such a good storyteller. He goes on and on about the most mundane things. The only reason I made it through the book is because I was looking for events I lived through and people I knew.The one thing I found surprising was how his fellow troopers treated him. I suspect if you could talk to them you would find out John was leaving something out of his story. I don't recomend this book to anyone."
4,2007 DVD TO BE RELEASED......FINALLY!!!!!,"LOOK UP SpielbergFilms.comWHEN YOU GET THE WEBSITE, CLICKON HOME, SCROLL DOWN TO ARTICLE.3RD FROM THE BOTTOM."
1,GIVE ME A BREAK !,I BOUGHT THIS TAPE THINKING IT WAS TWIGHT ZONE EPISODES BUT IT IS SOME OF THE WORST TRASH I HAVE EVER SEEN. ROD SERLING'S IDEAS WERE STOLEN AND REDONE INTO GARBAGE. I DON'T KNOW SPIELBERG AND WARNER BROS CAN GET AWAY WITH THIS CRIME. I HAVE BURNED MY COPY !GENE ADDINGTON
3,Entertaining... And thats about it.,"The monster scene in the beginning was a hoot for me. To see these two famous comedic actors in a scary comedic skit is just great!The first segment is alright. Many say it ends to abruptly, but thats because the actor in it was killed in the final helicopter chase segment in Vietnam. So now you know, God rest his soul.The second one TRIES to be a spielberg awe production, but its to cutesy.What the hell was the third one, i forgot?The one with John Lithgow on the plane is worse than the original episode with William Shatner himself! The only improvement is Lithgows acting (sorry, will).But the reason I rate this movie to begin with is the ending. You know, in the beginning Dan Akroyd asks if his friend in the car wants to see a little trick, and turns into a monster and kills him! Then, in the end, John Lithgow is being taken away in the ambulance, and the driver begins talking to him. Suddenly the driver asks if he would like to see a little trick..."
5,awesome! 10 thumbs up!,"This book was really good. I am not a very big reader, but I could not put this book down! It was a good adventure book. It is perfect for young adults who cant find a good book, like me, or for young adults that like to read a lot. it had everything a young adult needs in a book. I loved it! Like I said, 10 thumbs up!!!!!! you should really read it!!!"
1,"Dry, Factoid after Factoid","This book is exactly the type of book that has students across America saying ""I hate history."" If you are interested in personal storytelling, this is NOT the book for you. I had to read it for the Teaching American History Grant course work, otherwise I would have donated it to the ""Gosh I just wasted $15 and ten hours of my life file (it's round...holds things like discarded napkins, etc.)"""
2,Divas to the Dancefloor (Vol. 2),"Save for the remix of ""Nasty Girl,"" U Ain't That Good,"" and ""Music,"" the second volume of this series overall is just not that good. In fact, the rest of the mixes pale in comparison to other mixes I have. It's hard to believe you can take artists like Suzanne Palmer, Deborah Cox, and Offer Nissim and make them all sound bland."
4,Divas Has Some Pizazz,This CD has some pizazz to it. Some of the cuts are not exactly the same tempo as the others which makes the mix not 100% conducive to a dance/party atmosphere as compared to other CDs
2,Fun but exasperating,"I enjoyed reading this book on the surface. In other words, it's a good, fast read - enjoyable prose and an interesting premise.However, even though I enjoyed the story overall, found some of the historical information fascinating, and was very entertained by the plot and characters, at the end of the book, I was hopping mad because certain loose ends weren't explained, questions weren't answered, and odd situations weren't explored.I went back and reread some sections FIVE times to try and find what I must have missed, but the answers just weren't there."
3,Interesting Series,"In this third outing for Alex Plumtree, the owner of the Plumtree Press, he is invited to join the Dibdin Club just after finding a 15th century book hidden in his estate's library. But the book is stolen before he can enjoy it and the hunt is on.While Kaewert writes well, there was just too much to this book. Too many subplots, too many characters, too many agendas, too many attempted murders, too many coincidences, etc. Kaewert did well in keeping everything straight, but all that detracted from the mystery and the ending was too pat.I'll try the next in the series as well, but if the author continues to overwrite her books, I'll move on to another series with an author who can tell a good story in terser language."
3,Fasten your seat belt,"Plausible - no. Entertaining - yes. It's not great literature, or even a great mystery, but Untitled is a fun romp full of adventure and incredible near misses. Think Indiana Jones in spirit, although Alex Plumtree is definitely no Indiana Jones. Enough plot twists and red herrings to keep you guessing. If you approach it from that angle, you'll have a good time; Kaewert is a literate writer, unlike many in the genre. Enjoy the ride!"
4,Gothic Lovers' Must,"Kaewert's protagonist Alex Plumtree negiotiates between two worlds--the aristocracy and the modern day world of book publishing. Alex and his brother discover a rare old book in their private library, which leads them into an exciting adventure of thieves, would-be murders and an exclusive elitist bookclub. Kaewert writes a mystery that cannot be put down. The author's knowledge of book publishing and rare books provides an educational as well as believable text. Reading this book left me desperate to read her next book."
2,No Shirley on lead vocals!!!!!,"Be Warned --- Shirley Manson of Garbage fame only appears on this cd as a background vocalist. Listening to the cd I kept waiting to hear Shirley sing lead but it never happened. The music and songs are mediocre at best. Check out Shirley's other pre-Garbage band ""Angelfish."" Features Shirl on lead vocals. Recommended for any Garbage fan."
4,Quality flatwear for a reasonable price,I purchased this set a month ago and was delighted to find that it was a good quality heavy stainless steel. The extra serving pieces including a pierced serving spoon make this set a nice one to own.
2,Chip size has gotten much smaller,"I first started buying these 4-5 years ago. I have two large dogs who inhale everything in about .02 seconds. These used to be a lot larger and thicker and would last at least 30 minutes. The last box I just received was chips over 40% smaller and about the same thinner, the dogs eat theirs in less than 5 minutes. Still a good product but sad to see that it's not as a great a deal as it used to be. I will start buying the same sizes available at Petco or Petsmart...."
1,2.5 is not 17 lbs,I received my order today and was shocked to see that I paid 37.04 for an item that was advertised as 17 pounds to receive 2.5 pounds. I can eaisly say no rawhide chip is worth this price. I am very disappointed about the false advertisement.
4,Best unknown harp player out there,"I stumbled unto Carlos Del Junco on the web. Listened to some of the cuts on his web site and was blown away by the command he has over his instrument. I ordered one CD (Just Your Fool)and was amazed. From a technical standard he is better than anyone out there. His selection of music however is all over the place. Some of his stuff sounds like Miles Davis on the harp and some like the Harmonicats. This CD is my second favorite out of the five of his I own. The other three are average at best. I would highly recommend ""Just Your Fool"" over this one if you are a blues fan. It has Walking Blues, Key to the Highway, Rocket 88 and the absolutely amazing B Thing Intro. However it is not available on Amazon.com. This CD is worth buying if only for Another One Done Gone Down the Track which is the best harp/train simulation I've ever heard. Go to his web site to preview these songs. It's worth it."
3,A good Bandai flick,"The first time I watched this I didn't know what to make of it. As I sat in theater 3 at the Nandesucon I thought this was an early 90's mecha flick. Past the opening scene I was suprised to find that it was actualy about three women who wanted to get back to earth. The characters are your average anime women, a tomboy schoolgirl, a ditzy teacher, and a renegade mech pilot. I have never been impresed with Bandai. I first knew them as the importers of Power Rangers, somthing that dwindled my respect for the company. This DVD does not have the best visual quality, but is much better than the static of Eat Man 98', for those of you who own it. Personaly I like this DVD, it has action, humor, and busty women. But most importantly I can watch it again, somthing I can't say for many anime series."
5,Just Because,"""Honey Baby Sugar Child, Lord knows I love you so."" This is the simple first line that begins HONEY BABY SUGAR CHILD, a wonderful book that celebrates the love a mother has for her child. The warm and inviting illustrations mirror the sentiments of the storyline and help maintain interest. In a nutshell, the book is filled with various expressions of love that are realistic and full of emotion.This book has become a part of a daily reading ritual with my toddler. Sometimes he turns the pages as I read and other times we act out some of the scenes. As a mother of a boy, I really appreciate the fact that the child in the book is male; however, the story will appeal to readers of either gender. The story reminds parents of the importance of telling their children they are loved unconditionally, while maintaining a timbre that makes the book just plain fun to read.Reviewed by Stacey Seayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
1,misleading,"I had brought these speakers to be disappointed, the LED in the speakers didnt work at all. I sent them back for a replacement and those didnt work as well.I had to contact the Pyle company to find out that the speakers LED only works if you have a amp hooked to them or have enough watts to work them. I wouldnt have bought these if the site would have said that in the first place. The site says when they are in use the LED would work."
3,Really compare with a real speaker,Now i have the 6.5 inch version and ill say this again because i dont believe the highs magically improved in the smaller size. Hook up a infinity or a polk side by side with this speaker the highs are no where near as crisp and clear clean as the 2 ive meantioned. But the power is there they are loud and the mounting frame is kinda thin which doesnt make your door panels bulge out. Seems like im getting mostly mids and bass out of my speakers if the highs are better in this size id be wanting to return for these ones idk if anyone else noticed how the highs sound.
3,Okay ... and just okay,"The sound quality isn't as sharp as a 3 way or 4 way speaker. My Pioneers sound better. The lights work, but with my black OEM grill they don't seem all that bright. The lights are more novelty than real feature. But ... They were less than $30 after shipping."
4,yes,"nice item for the price / the grills do not cover/protectthe entire speaker cone, perhaps its made that way to enhance theblue light visibility, however this increases the possibility of damageto the speaker cone, that is the only thing I wish was different."
3,Regular sound,"Hoped that this enhances the sound was better. Although it is two-way, sound quality is average. Distorts the frequencies of 120 hertz. Not recommended. Although this price may be used to listen to music but can not demand more."
3,As the Title Says,"As the title says, this is primarily a pictorial history. The chapters of this book are only 3 or 4 pages of text and the remainder of the chapter is pictures with captions. Most of the pictures are small, being about the size of a baseball card, and in black and white. The book is organized more or less geographically, with the chapters following the building of the line from Alaska into Canada. Compared to other railroad books I own, this one is average. It doesn't stand out and there aren't many amazing photos, but it's certainly not the worst."
5,Just what I needed,"I almost didn't buy this book based on that ""joke"" review below, but boy am I glad I did! There is a ton of information here and it's just what I needed as a beginner!!! I can't wait to take the MSF course this spring and then start using the techniques in this book.I highly recommend it if you are thinking about getting into riding or if you're going to take the MSF course.Woohoo!"
3,"Good writer, but lacking material","I liked this book as Pat Hahn seems to be able to write a pretty good book. It was a generally quick read, and an easy one at that. However, what he chose to include and to leave out. I agree with the chapter on how to be a mentor or ride coach. Perhaps Pat is getting a bit ahead of himself? However, in the long run, I' probably go with the MSF's motorcycling Excellence, as it has more information, albeit, a bit dryer."
1,I believe it was a fake product,The shampoo that I recieved was unlike any other Crew shampoo that I have used in the past. It had a nasty smell and would barely lather.I have used Crew in the past and I have always been happy with the product. Helps with an oily scalp.
5,Fit for a prince!,I bought this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. He has very sophisticated taste in music. We both enjoyed listening to the cd which arrived well ahead of the anticipated delivery date. I'm just thrilled with this purchase.
2,Unarmed Combatives 5,"Hello! This is Hock. This old video was part of a old training set. Without the other fundamentals, it is not worth much at all. Instead? I would search on my name, W. Hock Hochheim on the internet and see all the new, vastly improved material, in training order and on DVD! That is where I would spend my money. This whole subject has been reshot, redone and is so much better on DVD and much cheaper too! Given the new DVD, I wouldn't waste my time with this old video at all."
3,Lightweight novel from Bennett,"Set during the first two decades of the twentieth century, this novel traces the life of George Cannon, who joins an architectural firm. He becomes interested at first in Marguerite, the daughter of one of the members of the firm, but she breaks off their engagement to care for her ill father. George then meets Lois, and after winning a design competition, they marry. Ten years go by, and despite the fact that he has three children, he feels it's his patriotic duty to enlist in the army now that WW I is in full swing. The book ends with him a member of the army, ready to do battle against the Germans. The book is not one of Bennett's better novels, mainly because the plot drags. Lois is decently developed, but Cannon, except for during some of the architect scenes, is a non-entity. The gung-ho flag waving at the end is tough to take seriously. An average, at best, work by Bennett."
2,Leave to the last!,"All of the wonderful things that have been said about Rory Gallagher in the other reviews for this album are true. He was an extraordinary artist, and it is sad that he has now gone, and did not have higher profile when he was alive. However, it is also true that this album, his debut album, is far and away the weakest disc he put out. So, if you want an introduction to Gallagher (and you do), don't start at the beginning; start with ""Irish Tour '74"" and work from there."
2,Terrible editing,"I have purchased many subtitled novellas that are edited without making you feel like you are missing anything. However, this movie has no flow and jumps back and forth so fast after a few lines are delivered that I had to stop watching it. There is no way to review the actual story."
2,beware,He spends the whole book trying to justify and reinforce his past beliefs and writings. Things looked promising early on but the arguments fell apart when he tried to marry psychology and god. I didn't realise I was going to be preached at!
3,I bought this for my mom,"after my mom watched a TV special she called me up and asked for the Johnny Cash movie. This is all I could find base of the description she gave. It wasn't the one she wanted, but she likes it anyway."
2,A Cash project that is very much below standard....,"I can only second what Puddleglumm (great nick ;-) has already written here before. Even though I love most everything that Johnny Cash has ever done, especially in his later years, I think that this film is downright awful. The blond Ikea-commercial Jesus obviously is historically inaccurate and his amateurish and uninspired acting is so off that the fascination that the ""historical Jesus"" must have exerted does not come through at all. Why would anybody have wanted to follow this sluggish blond fellow? The film certainly does not give any clue. And I did and do wonder why Johnny Cash and June Carter apparently did not mind the poor quality of the acting?? I assume that I won't watch the movie again, but I still like the ""comfortably creepy"" soundtrack--I still have that one on vinyl. Sorry if this might sound slightly offensive, but as a longtime Cash aficionado (I don't really like the word fan), I think that it's my duty to be honest."
1,amateurish movie,Very poorly done showing Jesus like and Anglo-saxon individual. I don't recomend it to buy at all.
5,Johnny Cash Gospel,This is a very thoughtful production & one I will go back to & also lend out to mt friendsTrevor Baldwin New Zealand
3,Had expected better sound,"Though the picture is OK for a 1973 movie, I must say the sound quality is far worse than I expected. Having the soundtrack LP in my collection, I can compare the sound versions, and must say they should have used a lot better sounding version.You'll have to turn up the volume a lot to make it sound better."
3,Objective review from a Johnny Cash fan,"Ok, let me first state that I am a Johnny Cash fan and also a Christian.I guess that would mean that my review should be pretty positive. Actually, however, I only give this 3 stars. Although I appreciate Johnny and June's heart and sincerity in this production, I can't say that it was one of the better depictions of the life and ministry of Jesus Christ that I have seen.Although I like the music (of course!) and appreciate the scenery, the blonde Jesus is a bit of a ""turn-off"" since he does not look authentic at all. Also, the acting is a bit stiff and the film itself is a bit ""jumpy"".I have to honestly say that if it was not done by Johnny and June Cash with their music featured throughout, my wife and I probably would have not watched the whole film.Again, I appreciate the heart and sincere faith and conviction behind the film, but I would stick to the JESUS film and/or MATTHEW for real Biblical portrayals of the life of Christ."
3,do ian and guy get a cut?,"let me preface this by saying i've seen these guy play a few times now -- i check them out here in toronto most times when they play, being that two of my closest friends are big fans -- decent rock show, but not as amazing as most of these reviewers will have you believe --as for their two recordings: throw all those comparisons you hear/read out the window (the clash!, springsteen?, c'mon! etc ...) -- pick up a copy of fugazi's red medecine and if you're still lost, you need more than a map --"
4,Keeps my 11 year old busy for a while.,I got this for my son for his 11th birthday. He has had a few chances to play with it so far this year. It keeps him busy for a little while figuring out new designs. For this price I say it is totally worth it.
2,amateur video,the conductor is'nt James Levine but Patané ! and the videotechnic very poor without light and focus...The Berini voice is a murmur far away in the crowd
3,EKO's Finest!!!,"This is EKO's finest CD!!! Their is a combination of jazz, rock, new age, and world music on this set. My favorites are Morning In Martinique and Navajo White. EKO receives almost no airplay in most parts of this nation...yet have a following of devoted fans. I am glad to be one of them!"
2,Misleading title,"Be sure to notice the small print under the main title ""in Detail"". This seems to be a book for a seamstress. It is all close up details, no full length pix at all, which is good if that is what you want. I wasn't thorough enough when I ordered this, and expected a book called ""Modern Fashion"" to be something different. So, just be sure this is what you are looking for. I would return it, or give it to a friend who sews or likes these details."
1,terrible,"I Bought this book with twenties century fashion in detail.amazon bundle these books together and recommend me buy together.i found two books contain 100 % same contents page by page....same content only different titleas a fashion historian, i feel so deceieved by amazonWhat on earth bundle same book together?"
2,Not up to snuff,"Definitely not as good as other books on the subject, such as Designing Web Pages with FrontPage 97 by Milburn & Burdman. The only section that was helpful to me was the one on Image Composer, but a lot of added html coding doesn't work. It doesn't work because she forgets html rules like putting "" "" in tags. That's just sloppy. Also, sometimes she has you add html (which is a pain) instead of using FP97 features that do the same thing."
1,I wouldn't call this advanced. more like rehashed basics...,"A lot of junk and filler. Not much substance when you compare it to what else is out there already. Looks like an effort on the publisher to cash in on the folks looking for advanced coverage of FrontPage.The only plus for this book is the coverage of database connectivity. Other than that, the book isn't worth your money or your time. The only problem is that the database stuff for FrontPage 97 doesn't work well (and doesn't work at all most of the time).I compared this book to many other books and it just didn't match up. Doesn't make a lot of sense."
5,from MainlyPiano.com,"""Numinous"" was pianist/composer George Skaroulis' second release, and is considered to be a classic in the new age/ambient genres. The title refers to the supernatural or divine, and of having a deeply spiritual or mystical effect, and that is certainly an apt description of the music. Introspective, a bit melancholy, and shimmeringly beautiful, Skaroulis creates a musical painting that will touch all but the most jaded of hearts. Skaroulis has been one of my favorite artists since I first heard his ""Second Nature"" album a few years ago, so it's fun to go back and retrace his musical steps. His Greek heritage is apparent in some of the instrumentation and spirit, but the mood is quiet and serene, making this a great album for reading, relaxing, massage, or just letting go of the cares of the day. Despite the calm and soothing sounds, I found this to be a great album to wake up to. Give your ears and soul a treat! Very highly recommended!"
2,Now I know why it was only aired on TV one time,"I ordered this title because (1) I like KISS, and (2) I always thought Paul Lynde was funny, but after viewing it one time (and possibly the only time) I can see why ABC only aired the show once. It's bad--not ""so bad it's good"" bad, but just bad. KISS looks really embarrassed to be here, and even the usually great Tim Conway is wasted. I'll admit it was a kick to see Margaret Hamilton in her WIZARD OF OZ Wicked Witch of the West garb, but the rest of the show falls painfully flat. It's so bad that it's hard to pick the most painful moment, but I will have to settle with Florence Henderson doing a disco-operatic version of ""That Old Black Magic."" I laughed once during the entire show, so it gets one star for that, and one star for KISS's performance."
4,a classic...this could not happen today,"What a great and strange video. Who would believe you could have KISS, Tim Conway, Florence Henderson and the Wicked Witch of the West in one special? The writing is funny, although often groan inducing, but all of the stars (celebrities?) are very game and make the schtick work. Paul Lynde keeps things rolling no matter how lame the jokes are. This one is really a classic."
3,My eyes! My eyes! They're melting!,"This is truly hypnotic...It's a few steps down from things like Donny and Marie or even Pink Lady and Jeff... but it's hypnotic nonetheless. Flo Henderson discoing? Margaret Hamilton and Witchiepoo hugging? And Kiss looking on?The mind reels when you think of how many people were involved in this show, and this was the result... It makes me think that the 70s were a dark, dark time.There's an audio interview with Peter Marshall (Hollywood Squares host) in the special features - very candid, and very fair, but you won't come away liking Paul Lynde any better...This is one of those things you should see... but rather than own it, try to trick your friend into buying it!"
1,More depressing than scary funny,"This reproduction of an old ABC variety show is just sad, featuring cheap sets and 3rd-rate stars.Poor Margaret Hamilton's make-up was very badly done.Florence Henderson tries to sing and Paul Lynde does way too much mugging for the camera in place of witty dialogue.KISS lip-syncs 3 songs and they're not very good ones, plus Gene doesn't do the ""tongue"" thing.It certainly took me back to the 70's in the hurry, but not really in a good way.The whole disc is a paean to the ""comedy genius"" of Paul Lynde, if you imagine that."
4,Classic 70's television,"Just finished watching this one. It is classic 70's variety television. Lots of great 70's television stars, humor, music, etc. Being a child of the 70's I LOVED it!!!"
3,Paul Lynde Fix,"I have always been a big fan of Paul Lynde and his quick wit. When I saw that his DVD was released, I had to have it. I have to say that I was a little disappointed, but I have to take into account that in the seventies TV was not what it is today. There are some great jokes and seeing Margaret Hamilton and Witchipoo was fun. I don't think kids would enjoy this as a Halloween show, but kids that grew in the seventies would enjoy it. And the concert of KISS."
3,It's OKAY,"It's not horrible, but certainly doesn't live up to the capabilities of Paul Lynde. Wouldn't necessarily watch it again, definately wouldn't outright purchase it."
4,Nostalgic look back,"I enjoyed it. If you'd like a nostalgic look at the late 70's and are into Kiss or early disco, this might be amusing to you. Cameos of ""young"" Donny and Marie Osmond, Pinkie Tuscardero from Happy Days, and Betty White... with a connection to Wizard of Oz wicked witch and HR PufNStuf's Witchiepoo. Paul Lynde was genuinely funny in his own unique way, in my opinion. I especially enjoyed Kiss' performances."
4,paul lynde,"Classic Pau; Lynde, a talent gone too soon. If you were a Bewitched or Hollywood Squares fan, you will enjoy this. Is it cheesy? You bet. But it is a classic. It is a shame that they do not make television like this any more. The live performances of KISS alone are worth the cost of this disc. Along with some great blast from the past guest stars."
4,The Ultimate 1970s TV Special,"This is bad, but representative of the holiday specials the networks used to put on TV. If you're into KISS then you'll be in heaven but for the most part this is a collection of lame jokes, horrible opportunities by actors to sing songs and sketch comedy performed by Tim Conway and Paul Lynde. The extras on this DVD (particularly the quote quiz) makes up for the painful Halloween antics of this special... at least if you're a fan of Paul Lynde."
5,Great Blu Ray,"Just watched this blu ray and once again I was very impressed with Shery Crow and her band. I love the addition of the horns. The set list is very good, would say it was great if Sign Your Name was in the show. That is my favorite song on the new CD. Regardless, this is still a excellent show, love the different version of I Shall Believe. Video and sound are all excellent."
1,Hate Sheryl's new band,I've seen Sheryl twice live and both shows were really fun. I had no idea she had dropped her longtime band. The new band doesn't groove very well during most of the songs. I also have never liked doyle bramhall's guitar playing. His technique is so limited. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this dvd.
2,Warning,"First Look Pictures has done this film and viewers a disservice. Aside from cutting 23 minutes from the original theatrical release, thereby making the narrative chopped and damaging the more fluid presentation of the original film, they have also overly saturated the color and brightness of the film during the reminiscent episodes, as well as some of the segments concerning the ""Reds."" I will applaud them for providing better clarity in the sound reproduction for dialogue, but ultimately would recommend avoiding this blu-ray transfer (as well as their regular DVD, due to similar editing)in favor of the original theatrical release, which is available through various vendors: RedSun DVD; DVD Asian; or YesAsia. Alternatively, try to track down an Asian blu-ray that presents the original run-time and that also offers a better quality transfer than First Look."
1,Missing 20 minutes,"If you like your films cut up this is an ok movie but feels incomplete. It feels incomplete because around 20 minutes is left out. They don't put it in extras, just assume no one will notice. Maybe the high ratings here are people who don't know it's one sixth cut. Fortunately the top review in the steelbook edition mentions it. Just passing it to all here."
2,Fistfull Of Dollars,"This is just a hyped up version of the Sergio Leone classic. Manga meets Spaghetti Western. It really doesn't flow very well and the clashing of ideologies in the film does not do credit to samurai movies, manga, or spaghetti westerns. I think it is a hodge-podge mess personally."
3,Sort of boring,The story is sort of boring but the character of town sheriff saves this movie from being a snooze fest. It has it's moments but not nearly enough of them.
4,Different In a good way,"I liked this movie alot. it was wierd at first i didnt get it. but after watching more the movie was realy good, I am glad i bought it and will watch it many more times."
5,Asian western fusion,Wow this is not for the faint harted. If you enjoy westerns and kung-fu then this movie is for you it has both in one movie. Don't take my word for it see it.
1,Would give 0 stars if it was possible!,"This is quite honestly the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. I really, REALLY, don't get the positive reviews.If you don't stay away from this movie I guarantee that you will waste your money and waste 2h of your life. I'd rather sit and look at a wall than watch this movie. I watched it all the way through just to make certain, but every single minute sucked big time. When I was done honestly I took my baseball bat and I destroyed it to shreds.I won't even dignify it by describing it. Just take a stranger's word for it."
2,Corny but entertaining!,This quite an action pact film but it pushes the envelop of the spaghetti western too much toward ridicule. To expect anything to be taken seriously or real. It is more of an action comedy in a twisted way a little a la Tarentino. The Trailer once on the Apple site gives the impression of a pure action film but that is not the case but if you know what you are getting into then it's quite fun to watch!
1,BAD CUT of an Awesome movie,"I don't know why, but this wonderful movie has been cut by about 20 MINUTES. Blasphemy! I don't know where to find a full version containing the original theatrical version with Region 1 coding, but this disc certainly isn't it.In regards to the movie, it's a brilliant meditation on the reflexive nature of the Spaghetti Western genre as a back-and-forth between Japanese and American cinema replete with beautiful cinematography, clever action sequences, snappy dialog and constant meta-humor within the plot, characters, and sets. It is at all times vibrantly colorful and thoughtful in its execution, and I would rank it with ""HERO"" in terms of aesthetics and ""KILL BILL Vol. 2"" in terms of tone and action.All of which is why I'm giving this particular package 1 out of 5. Not a single bit of it is a waste of time! Boo, butchers!"
2,Painful,"This movie was dull and painful. At times, the quieter scenes seemed to last forever, and I swore I could feel myself aging. Would have been better probably in Chinese with subtitles. Sophomoric and undercooked. I give it two stars because the woman could fight, and that was awesome for a whole 2 minutes."
1,Really Bad,"Just because a movie is a parody of a genre does not mean it is a good parody. I found this film to be a bad waste of time. No surprise that the story line is familiar ... that is expected. However, everything that happens in the movie is obvious and just plain dumb. The film is gratuitously violent which is far from the worst part of the movie.It is extremely hard to impossible to understand the dialogue. Either this film needs to be subtitled, dubbed or have the actors learn to articulate in English. As it stands, you can only understand maybe half of what is said ... and I consider myself particular adept at speaking with individual with diverse dialects. I am glad I bought this used for $1. It really was not even worth that."
1,LAWL,Confusing. Slow opening. Lasted about 18 minutes and then I tossed the DVD into a grinder. Life got better. MY GRADE: F.
2,A waste of time,Sukiyaki Western Django at first look interesting with lots of action but in reality it was a waste of time and money. One of the main things that got to me was the extremely poor dialog between characters so much I was hoping I can at least put the Blu-ray in Japanese with English subtitles. All I could do was keep listening to the poor dialect while having the movie in subtitles if I couldn't understand what they said. For all you guys who care more about action then story telling you will still be disappointed with lackluster gun and sword play don't get me wrong there was some good action scenes but none can excuse the movie poor excuse of a story line and character development. I only paid eight bucks for this movie and I feel I got cheated out my money the only use I have for this Blu-ray is to use it as a coaster do ya self a favor and don't bother even watching this.
4,Gorgeous cinematography and impressive acting,"I admit I'm a little quirky and I like all kinds of movies. This movie is so impressive for its gorgeous cinematography and the fact that these Japanese actors speak in English throughout - not perfect English, but that is quite a feat. And many of the actors wore their own Western gear. A Western set in Japan, what's not to like? Hang in there for the stunning ending.My only negative comment about this movie is Quentin Tarantino's appearance - totally unnecessary, and decreased my enjoyment of the movie overall."
1,AVOID UNLESS YOU NEED SLEEP,"Not fun.Starts out promising, but then goes downhill fast.Too much violence to females.Too much talk.I only wish ANOTHER 23 minutes had been cut from the original cut.AVOID."
1,F380 review,"Piece of junk. The paper keep jamming no matter what I did. Rather than return it, I threw it in the trash the next day. It's in a landfill now where it belongs."
1,AC adapter,Why I even bothered buying this I'll never know - when would I use a GPS inside my home? DUH!
3,Good but why not use the USB port?,"Works fine, but it would be better if it used the USB port. Then I could use this to charge my cell phone, and the Garmin.Also would have given it 5 stars if it recharged the battery."
1,"Wrong Item Described, Will Not Work With This Unit","Item was wrongly described by amazon, will not fit unit that I purchased it for at the same time. Unable to find correct one on amazon."
1,wrong item listed on website--did not fit,"I did not get full credit for my return, wrong item sent to me, may not purchase from Amazon again"
1,This movie sucks.,"Zombie Strippers sounds like it would be a funny/interesting movie to watch and it has Jenna Jameson in it so you would think that it would be at least appealing to men, but it sucked. Rented this with my boyfriend for a good laugh and was bored the entire time. Even he got bored and there were half naked women in it. Shut it off early, wasted my money."
3,Zombies,The movie was ok! It's wasn't believable to believe guys was attracted to rotten flesh woman. The killing kill have been better.
2,Gory Satire,"Roger Corman fans will like it, not sexy at all but a gory send up of government created zombie movies"
1,C MOVIE,"Not bad idea but horrible execution.ZERO story structure and logic even for a comedy horror, e.g. no distance between lab and club.There was no main character or development, just an ensemble of nonsense. The ending was especially poor and didn't use the 1 likable survivor,"
5,"it's a zombie movie, what do you expect?",not the best but its a zombie movie. its a way to pass the time so don't expect too much from it
1,The Worse Movie I have EVER Seen,I don't even know where to start; this movie is just bad. It made no sense from beginning to end. I think the director was going for the worse movie of the year award. Who thinks up such non-sense? I only watched it because it was free on Amazon with Prime membership. Amazon really does need to do better with the free movie choices. If this is what I have to watch as a Prime member I'd rather be regular.
1,dumb,"Not the dumbest, but right up there. Lot of tits and ass, but that's not all I need from a movie. A slightly better story would be nice. No, a lot better story. I should have known better, but being a premium member, it was free so to speak."
3,Beautiful Girls Wasted,Lap-dancers are turned into zombies with mortal consequences for attending the illegal venue: the more blood-the more males like it!This film is not my cap of tea surely.
3,Zombie Strippers is a blast!,"If you are looking for total laughter, blood, nudity and Zombies this movie is just for you! I enjoyed this movie because it was meant to be a comedy so if you are looking for a serious Zombie movie don't buy this movie. The female Zombies were very hot!!"
