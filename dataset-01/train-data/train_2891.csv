1,Save your Money,"I'm sorry I took the chance. Logitech usually has pretty good stuff- but not in this case!Right out of the box, this thing was flimzy and stunk of cheap, sweat-shop, freshman-like engineering! The factory owner's son must have designed this and Dad was cutting him some slack (a ton of slack!) #1-It doesn't charge your iPod. #2-you connect via the headphone port, so you don't get a digital signal into the speakers. #3-I hate seeing Sakar (an extremely low end brand) selling the exact same item for $20.00 less. I guess they felt sorry for the factory owner's son too.I returned the item of course, but I still feel like I got ripped off. I'll think twice and shop harder the next time I see Logitech's brand on anything.I ordered the Logic 3 iStation and now I'm dancing to a different tune!"
1,Buy if you like a piss poor product!,"This thing sucked the battery life of my ipod with superb velocity. The sound is tinny and weak, the volume a hair past a whisper (you can blare your headphones to get a better sound), just about everything about this Plastic Pete screams cheap. I would have sent it back but I'm lazy and it only cost me a few bucks. Buyer beware, you get what you pay for."
2,"Portable enough, but speakers are low rate","Although this device is extremely portable (you can fold them up, and they come with a carrying case), the speakers are very low quality. I hadn't had the speakers for 3 days, and one of them already blew out. When you turn up the volume on the speakers, the sound becomes muffled and full of static...Through all that, I am still using them, though!"
4,Portable speaker great for travel,"The logitech mm22 portable speaker is small, light and works great for background music from my MP3."
4,DOESN'T CHARGE iPOD (but otherwise good),"I just got the Logitech MM22 Speakers yesterday. They put off excellent sound. Also, they're compatible with any device that has a headphone line-out.However, I wish I had read more carefully before I purchased because I didn't realize that the set doesn't have a dock connector (as some of the more expensive speaker sets do). You can still charge your iPod, but it involves supplying your own charge cord and would also require an additional outlet (or a nearby USB/firewire port on a computer). Also, the speakers aren't terribly sturdy; the iPod shakes around a lot in it if you move it.Still, I'd recommend the MM22 to anyone who needs something to tide them over until they can get the really nice Bose dock."
4,"Good sound, portable","The cord is a bit too short. The sound sounds good to a layman. However, I'm writing this review because of one issue...I don't know why, but it lets out a periodic honking noise. I think it does it during the bass. [...]"
1,IPOD Video Users - DO NOT BY THIS PRODUCT,Nothing worked with my IPOD Video unit using all the cables and fresh batteries. It would be a better use of your money to blow it on some unit that someone has reviewed positively on Amazon.
5,Great for the price and works with any iPod!,"The Logitech MM22 Portable Speakers are great! I have a 3G iPod, an iPod mini and an iPod Shuffle, all works great and the sound is good enough for a medium size room. I used it in my bedroom and as an Alarm Clock with my iPod when I travel. The set of speakers are very light and feels ok and works with any kind of portable audio device, no just iPods!Pros:+Great Price!!!!!!+Good Sound: Trebble and Bass+Very Compact: Great for travels+It's powered via AC (included) or batteries+Did I Say Price????Cons:-No iPods Auto Charge, you must charge the iPod via the dock connector with it's AC Charger-Not as loud as others more expensive iPod Speakers.-The line out cable doesn't look as good as if the iPod were connected via the dock's audio out port"
1,Is that as high as it goes?,"I feel misled by the rave reviews here and elsewhere. I jumped at this given the price and others' praise. The latter was misplaced; the former wasn't low enough.The MM22 might be fine for a hotel room, but it'd better be a damned quiet hotel. I have trouble hearing the damned thing even when I press it to my ears. Yes, I've found the volume buttons, and yes it makes a difference - from inaudible to barely audible.The design is cute, the carrying case is nice (though excessive unless you need to carry all 3 cables and all 3 adapters, which you won't), and the price is low. But cheap is cheap, and this one's not the effort."
5,Nicely portable - midlevel pricing.,"I purchased these as a requested Christmas gift for our 14 year old niece. It was about in the middle, costwise, of the various IPOD speakers out there on the market. She preferred this as it was lightweight and more portable than some others. Although I know little about these things, it did work well in terms of producing clear sound, which is after all the primary purpose! She was delighted so I give it 5 stars on the recommendation of a teenager."
5,Ipod speakers,"I purchased the Logitech portable speakers earlier this month.The minute I unpacked them and hooked them up to my ipod, I was blown away by the awesome sound that came out of those small speakers. This by far one of the best buys I have made from Amazon in the past few years."
1,Total disappointment,I ordered this product thinking it was based on Rosamunde Pilcher's inter Solstice. It was not! What a drag! The film ended and I thought I had fallen asleep during it and decided to watch it again. I did not make any sense.
5,"Liked the movie, but hated the previews","The DVD begins with what seemed like endless previews and I could not escape them. The disk did not permit fast-forwarding, nor was I able to access the menu. It was worse than being at the Cineplex, for there I can at least wait out the trailers by standing in the lobby. When I buy a DVD to watch in my home, I deeply resent having to sit through any previews. This trend needs to be protested."
1,Bad title,"If you think you are going to see a Rosamound Pilcher movie from her great book of the same name you won't. Slow paced, weak story line and nothing from the book. I'm sorry I wasted my money. Ordered ""Coming Home"" at same time. Wonderful adaptation of book!"
1,Winter Soltice,"I periodically search for Rosamunde Pilcher's Winter Soltice that has been made into a TV movie by a German company. It has been available in the UK but never here. The movie highlighted under that title is not Mrs. Pilcher's story, but something completely different.Please find the Pilcher story in video for the U.S. fans."
1,boring and horrid boys,i was waiting for this boring movie to start it was colorful set in nice place the boys unlikable weird ansty nothing happens should have read the comments first i thought this was a Pilcher novel also..............so sorry to waste my time
2,"I Think We Missed Something . . . Or, Did We?","Whatever the point was of this movie, both my wife and I missed it. This film reminded me of a Kung! (African) woman who wrote a book about traditional African life. She would tell of some war their tribe fought; when it was over, they ""all just went back to living."" Then, they would kill an elephant and have a big feast; then, they all just went ""back to living."" Or, it might be the time for initiation of the boys or a girl's entry into womanhood and there would be all the celebrations associated with that; then, they all went back to ""just living.""Well, this movie skips all the highlights; we are left with watching the father and boys ""just living"" their lives. I guess this movie is for voyeurs who like to watch people just living their personal lives. When the credits came on, I didn't know if I should be happy it was over or frustrated that I never caught what story they were trying (I presume) to get across."
5,"An Exciting Read, Great Environmental Message.",Even if one doesn't care about the plight of marine species like Chilean Seabass this book makes a great read! It is a thrilling good guy bad guy story taking place in a desolate part of the world. It also very informative and insightful regarding Marine Conservation.
3,Hooked pirates poaching and the perfect fish,It was a good book about fishing. Their are a few books out thier better Spike Walkers Working on the Edge it was a great book on crabing in alaska in the hay day.
2,Empty Ending,"This book is actually a discussion of how commercial fishing is dangerously reducing the supply of fish. It follows a long and dangerous chase of a vessel thought to have been illegally fishing in Australian waters. Then, nothing comes of it."
4,Good book,I enjoy fishing and eating fish and I enjoyed Hooked. It made me appreciate the scarcity of certain resources.
4,OSHA,This was a great introductionary book to OSHA standards for the general industry. I learned a lot. The book is really good about giving examples of real-life instances. I found that I wanted to read every word.
3,OK if you need it,This book was required for a college class. It is full of OSHA regulations that anyone in the right position would need to know.
3,Fast shipping,"I thought I was ordering a different version of this book. However, it was in great condition. Some highlighting inside. Works for the purpose of my class. Not a bad purchase."
5,Price Pfister wide spread Catalina oil rubbed bronze faucets,I am very happy with the oil rubbed bronze faucets! I wish I could find two BRUSHED BRASS wide spread faucets. I have purchased the only center set brushed brass Catalina faucet in the United States!!
5,Love it,I'm so happy with this toy.My 2 years old son got his first puppy from his godmother.We needed one more because its his favorite toy and he's going everywhere with it. He can't sleep without his puppy. I was so happy to be able to order another little friend for my son.We rotate them.Its safe to have 2 love toys.I'm very happy with the buy.
4,Exceptionally satisfied customer,"I believe that this Webkinz series is the best idea in a long while. The toys are well made, and very reasonably priced. The 'on line' feature is a real plus!! Well done all around!!:o))"
4,dalmation webkinz,My nephew looked everywhere for this toy. We found it through Amazon in minutes. He LOVES it.
2,Tavish Toys? (Not typical Webkinz quality here),"Well... this was a ""stocking"" present for my youngest, who was quite excited that I had found a retired(!) Webkinz ""Fire-dog."" It became his favored stuffed toy, and a fairly constant companion, but less than a week later the seam along the back popped open. He was not rough with the dog, didn't use it any differently than any other webkinz or other stuffed toy, so I wasn't overly impressed with this particular one. If you've ever seen Mrs. Santa Claus (The movie) you'll understand the reference to Tavish Toys... (""It only has to last till Christmas"")That being said, the 2 star review is strictly based on the lack of quality in this one specific item, as we've never had issues with any of our other webkinz."
4,Very Fun,"Bought this for my 3 year old boy, he has hardly walked away from it since we gave it to him for christmas"
5,Real crane for real fun,Not at all like that stuff that comes from China. This is a well build machine that my two year old boy actually sleeps with. He LOVES this crane and play very rough with it and everything is just fine. No breaks after 8 months of tough two year old love. Too bad other toys are not this dependable or realistic.
3,Bruder Man Crane truck,"Plastic truck, not sturdy as a child toy should be. Fun to play with, small loose parts for support of truck on the side. It is made of all plastic and not die-cast metal, it is easily breakable. I think that this is better than other trucks available this time as even tonka is making trucks with plastic."
5,Bruder amazes with realism,"This is my second Bruder purchase. So far, the build quality and durability of both are top-notch. This crane truck was a good alternative to the much more expensive and larger Bruder Scania Crane Truck. What are the differences I gave up for half the cost and size? Lights and sound, and integrated stabilizers. That's about it. This was a gift for my 3 yr-old son. While he can't put away the stabilizers on the back very easily, he otherwise can operate the truck as designed. My only concern about Bruder is they have so many products, when my son is old enough to read, he'll start asking for all of them. If he only knew they have fire truck with lights, siren, and actually squirts water..."
5,"Great truck, as always from Bruder","My 4 year old absolutely loves this truck. It has different knobs for the different operations of the crane. Yes, it is plastic but it is well made. Bruder is a German manufacturer and Germans have a history of making good toys. Just pay close attention to the string on the crane. It can get loose at times but it winds back up pretty easy. We are getting more Bruder trucks as we speak for our son. I like these better than any other toy truck manufacturer right now. I do wish the side mirrors on the door were a little stronger, I do expect them to break at some point in time. However, it is a nice truck and worth the price."
5,perfect,perfect truck for my 6 year old grandson... arrived in two days... who could ask for more! he is very happy
4,Son Loves This,My Son loves this ... he got it from Santa. The only problem we have is the string with the medal hook does get tangled up if he pulls it in too fast.
5,Every boys dream toy!,"This is a wonderful crane. Very user friendly, durable and a tremendous hit with our 5 y.o. grandson. I am now looking at other Bruder trucks to get him."
2,Not Extra Large,"Unless your child is a wee one, these arm bands are not big enough. There should be an age range connected with the product description."
2,Not a real touchscreen,"I purchased this product because I thought it was a real touchscreen. But it is not. You have to use the stylus to move a hard-to-see-cursor using the bottom keys. You do not use the stylus directly on the numbers screen to choose a square like in other models. Bottom line, I did not like it."
3,Does not perform nearly as well as my old one.,I had one of these for years. I really liked it and spent more time with it than I should have. I purchased another online that did not work. Tried another through Amazon. It works but still has problems. They just don't make things like they used to.
5,Great pop music,"A co-worker mentioned his daughter listening to Jillian Wheeler's music and I figured I'd buy the cd for my nieces. Needless to say, they love the music and my sister-in-law doesn't have to worry about lyrics they shouldn't be listening to."
1,Total Junk,Don't even waste your money. This stuff is cheap garbage. The phone charger worked once and hasn't worked since. Buy something else!
4,A Horrifying Look at Law and Lynching in America,"Mark Curriden and Leroy Phillips, Jr. in Contempt of Court look at the case of Ed Johnson, a black man given a stay of exection by Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan after he was tried and convicted for rape in a misguided and injudicial trial. The Supreme Court was ignored and the poor man was lynched which provoked the Supreme Court to the unusual action of becoming involved. This is a well written and exciting telling of the events and will carry the reader along on a wave of outrage. It is sure to be turned into an exciting film. It does not, unfortunately, tell the whole story of lynching, nor is to trying to. This one action by the Supreme Court belies the inactivity of the court and the justice system to stem the tide of lynching and racial injustice. But that story is told in other books and the reader will find this particular book a fascinating footnote on legal and racial history in America, both good and bad."
3,Too shallow from a research point of view,"This book contains mostly of introductory content. It provides too much background knowledge but never goes into the core of any technical problems, so the book is definitely too shallow for any serious researcher. Moreover, as it lacks implementation details and case studies, I don't think developers will find it useful, either. Maybe it serves best the executives who want to know what data broadcasting is and how data broadcasting can be used for."
1,Dissatified,I purchased this Vivatar 5000 with 5 Rotary slide trays about a month ago. I have had trouble with it ever since I started using it. The slide changing arm doesn't go all the way in and hangs. I recently showed some slides to my company and the slide change button ceased to function. I have only run about 500 slides thru the projector. I am very dissatified with it.
5,Excellent Projector,"I think this is a fine projector, at an equally fine price. It takes a bit of figuring out, in terms of operation, but then all things do. I've shown many slides on it, and everything projects great."
1,Vivitar 5000 AF Slide Projector,"When I received this product, it was a big disappointment to find out the lense came with the projector wasn't the right one for this model. I was lucky to get my full refund but I would suggest not buying it on line. Sorry to say."
1,Not Worth It At All,Vivitar 5000 AF Slide ProjectorFirst of all the autofocus button didn't even exist on the attached remote. The clarity of slides when projected was poor. The arm on the slide projector kept jamming. I'm sending it back now.
4,It is okay,It is very slow and jams a lot. Only used it a few times. The circular trays get stuck a lot. I have no patience for it.
3,slide projector,"A projector I got luckily. To view my slides I was unable to find it in the market. Also, once again the price is the most important aspect of this purchase. About 1/7 of its price!! I highly recommend any purchase through Amazon.com"
4,Nice hammers,"I'm a mechanic and go through mallets pretty fast, these are lasting nicely, worth the money."
5,He's just soooo glamourous!!!!,"Graham Norton.""SO ME"" reads just like watching Graham Norton. If you have ever seen Graham perform live...you will understand. He is a very personable performer and spends a lot of time with the audience between takes. He's witty, naughty and super fun!This book is just the same!Enjoy!"
3,"Yeah, OK book.","Interesting life for sure but probably not enough in it for me to rate it higher, but a good insight to a popular figure"
2,Frusrating and Incomplete,"This book was recommended to me as a MUST READ! I was taken into the plot fairly quickly, but as I neared the end, I felt as though half the book was missing. I kept waiting for the stories to deepen, but they never did. Finally, Auster drops them altogether, with virtually no pay-off. And the ending, (which I think was supposed to be a surprise), seemed to me painfully obvious from the beginning, which made the character annoyingly dense. I have never read Auster before, but I may try one of his earlier works- one that doesn't seem like a re-hash."
2,Disappointing,"This book was a complete disappointment to me. I don't mind being left to wonder a little about what may have occurred, but this was ridiculous...it started out well, but it seemed as though Auster just got bored and gave up at the end."
3,Kafkian,"Nice book and fairly original, really pleasant to read except for the complicated intertwining stories. Slightly Kafkian."
1,Auster's Worse Book,"This was a major disappoinment. I have read nearly all of Auster's books, and this was one of my least favorites. The main problem is the ending, and how nothing comes together. Towards the end of the novel, the character, Sidney Orr, gives up on his book, which I think was a metaphor for Auster giving up on Oracle Night. Most of Auster's books, no matter what the subject matter, always manage to bring into question themes of great importance and value. This book failed to do that. Even though I live in Brooklyn, and enjoy the Brooklyn references, I still think it is a major unoriginal cop-out. This book could have been a lot better if he managed to tie in the significnace of ""Portugal"" with the climax of the story. For Auster fans, you might find some interesting patterns or insightful coincidences, but if you are new to Auster, skip it, and read The New York Trilogy or The Book of Illusions. Hopefully his next one will be better.-J"
3,What Oracle?,"Not sure what Auster's intentions were for this one other than to provide the reader with a series of novel treatments that he never got around to writing. Tied together by the narrator's relationship with Grace and a famous author who used to be Grace's lover, it failed to provide closure at every level."
2,Oracle Night: A Good Sleep Spoiled...,"Though Oracle Night shows promise in the form of several very interesting plot lines, in the end the promise is left unfulfilled.There is a fascinating story within a story narrative; a tale of a mysterious and enchanting journal; and an unfolding drama that slowly reveals the secrets of a flawed three-person relationship. Each storyline is intriguing and could have been developed into stand-alone books in their own right. But as parts of the whole, they just don't add up.As a result, Oracle Night is an interesting yet unsatisfying read. The reader is lead down too many paths that ultimately lead nowhere. Though you get an understanding of how all the storylines connect, the connection is paper-thin and you are ultimately left with a ""so what?"" kind of feeling. Were that the purpose was more clearly illustrated or if the story had a singular focus then this might very well have been a different and much more satisfying book."
4,Hard work at first...then sucked me in!,"I absolutely was riveted by the slowness of this book, if that makes sense. As a writer, I found it fascinating to read how his characters were developed in the story within the story....and how he wrote himself into a whole. It was enigmatic, subtle, and calm. Loved it so much I bought another four of his novels."
3,"Wonderful beginning, then ultimately collapses","I couldn't agree more with the statements made about the book being beautifully written, intriguing plots and stories within stories, the magical, mystical aura evoked and on and on. So, I was not only disappointed but actually surprised when a book that I thought was great for the first 180 pages totally fell flat for the last 50 pages. It's almost as if Auster himself painted himself into a corner and then, as the character in the book does, decides to rip up what he has created. I've read many of Auster's books and admit that my favorites are the early ones. Oracle Night started out with the promise of being in the revered company of those very special books. I wish I understood what happened. Did Auster himself tire of the plot and characters? This could have and should have been great."
3,"Great style, so-so execution","I loved Auster's character development. Loved it. They all seemed like real and complex people. Even the characters in the story within the story.The plot started out great. I liked the concept, but it seemed like he gave up on it towards the end. There was opportunity to make the story more surreal and interesting, and he backed off. The story being written in the blue book was fascinating, but he dropped it halfway through and almost forgets about it. The foreshadowing of the husband and wife relationship was perhaps too much as that whole upcoming part of the plot was obvious. He did a better job with the friend's junkie son, but still the ending seemed disappointing in that it wasn't surprising in the least. Hence why I wish he pursued the mystical Chang/book route more.Overall though, it was still a good read, and the 230-ish pages go by quickly so you wouldn't be risking too much wasted time. I will read other novels of Austers."
4,About premonitions and reality,"Sidney Orr, a writer recovering from an illness everyone thought he wouldn't recover from, walks out of a stationery shop with a blue Portuguese notebook. As he starts writing a story in this book about a man who has had a near death experience and sees in that a sign to start a new life, strange events occur around him. The owner of the store closes his business overnight and his wife breaks down in tears at which point he fears his marriage might be over.Slowly but surely, Auster weaves a wonderful tale in this novel, where the lives of all these characters become more realistic as the story develops. Orr will spend time with M. R, Chang, the stationery store owner and will also piece together a part of his wife's past that she never spoke of.This is a fascinating story, superbly told by Paul Auster."
2,Disappointing,"A novelist with writer's block (Auster) writing a novel about a novelist with writer's block (Orr) struggling to write a story about a man who walks away from his life (Nick). If you think this is a clever premise, you won't once you've read Oracle Nights. Auster hooks the reader with a compelling start, but that only heightens the disappointment once you realize that you're on a rollercoaster to nowhere.Auster is now on auto-pilot; there's nothing in this novel that he hasn't done more effectively in other works. Marco Fogg walks away from his life in Moon Palace, as Nick does in this book. Ed Victory's compulsive and seemingly senseless cataloguing of phone books mirrors Flower and Stone's wall in Music of Chance. Stories within stories and New York vistas feature prominently as always. This novel reads like assorted threads of Auster-isms randomly assembled, some of which are pulled together in a flat, unsatisfying conclusion and some of which are left dangling. Not recommended."
2,"No, don't ignore the critics...","Like others here, I also have been an Auster fan. But the critical caveats already mentioned by others regarding this latest effort are all too well taken. Yes, it is readable in a ""what happens next"" sort of way, but it ends up being little more than a tiresome bag of tiresome, self-referential, post-modern humdrum, trotted about in the hope the reader will discover some sort depth within its slicked up surface. Zen? Meditations upon chance, time, dream, or the unforseen ramifications of choice? Not here, I'm afraid. Just a narrative exercise that, like others have said, goes nowhere in particular and ends the reader up at book's end in that locked, lightless little room with some ""Pop! Smack!"" and ""Pow"" thrown in to lend it all a dubious sense of location."
1,Very very depressing,"This is one of those books that makes one wonder about newspaper reviewers. Whilst none said Oracle Night was Mr Auster's best, the tone was that even minor Auster was rather special.Alas, it seems that minor Auster is merely minor. The writing is as lazy as others have described. Annoyingly so. The only interesting part of the book (the Flitcraft pastiche) is abandoned. The rest is just annoying.Very very sad."
2,Why did Auster publish this book?,"I wouldn't recommend anybody to buy this book. It is very disappointing. The beginning is exciting and makes you expect that the different stories of the book-within-the-book-within-the-book will reveal a subtle geometry conneting them, but then the ""metaprotagonist""/writer Orr gets his protagonist (Bowen) stuck and everything in the main story becomes predictable, mawkish, and even vulgar.I very much liked ""Leviathan"" and ""The Book of Illusions"", but I cannot understand why Auster published this book; unlike his protagonist Orr, he doesn't seem to need the money. I want mine back."
2,Intriguing; but ultimately disappointing,"This book caught my attention quickly, and kept me puzzled and, at times, almost, spellbound. There were layers upon layers of coincidence and happenstance, and I felt that ultimately, surely, this would all come together through skillful writerly sleight-of-hand. Such was not, however, the outcome. Countless hints and feints just fade away, never explained, never resolved. The ""resolution"" was too quick and incomplete; almost a quickie deus-ex-machina formulation, leaving far too many issues hanging, unexplained, irritating, bothering, and making me wonder whether I hadn't wasted my time on this book."
4,Compulsive and original,"Sidney Orr is a novelist living in New York. At the beginning of ""Oracle Night"", he is still recovering from a serious illness. The Novel is set in 1982 and the reader follows the novelist's life for nine eventful days. The plot starts when Sidney discovers a blue notebook at the Paper Palace, a stationary shop in Brooklyn. Soon Sidney falls under the spell of the empty notebook and he starts using it to write the beginning of his new novel. He at once finds himself trapped in a world of premonitions and events which threaten his marriage and undermine his faith in reality. Paul Auster skilfully mingles the realms of everyday life with the imaginary world the Sidney is trying to create in the blue notebook. A compulsive and original novel. On this audiobook, you can hear the writer reading his own novel, which is a nice complement to the novel itself."
5,EXCELLENT WORK,"I am writing this short note because it is funny to see the low quality of many readers who wrote a negative review about Oracle Night. This is a great piece of work by Auster for many reasons. It is just a good piece of literature. People who cannot appreciate the mastery displayed by Auster in this short novel should just discontinue reading this type of high quality work and invest more of their time in reading the kind of airport conventional paperbacks that provide exactly what they want and demand in their reviews (and that writers in the league to which Auster belongs rarely provide). If you love good literature, discover Auster by reading Oracle Night. It won't disappoint you. Promise."
2,Patchwork,"I'm not sure if the two-star rating is for me or for Mr. Auster: me for being dumb, or the author for writing a half-senseless story. I love symbolism, and have enjoyed many novels most find too weird and 'out there.' But ORACLE NIGHT just plain lost me.There was no sense of connection between several episodes. It's like they were plopped in, maybe from other stories, just for the heck of it. A quilt may have an underlying meaning to it; to a degree, ORACLE NIGHT seems to be random patchwork."
3,A bit too obvious,"I have to say that Oracle Night left me more conflicted than any other Auster book I've read so far (and I'm pretty sure I've read them all).On the one hand, the mini-stories within the story are excellent, and so is their subtle value as metaphors or premonitions regarding the ""real story"" and the truth about its characters. But on the other hand, I found the mini-stories to be much more interesting and touching than the actual story, which was rather bland.I usually like Auster's books because of the semi-random encounters, and daily detective-like mysteries that he weaves into his tales, but here, with all due respect to the mysterious M.R. Chang, it just wasn't fun enough. And somehow, half-way through the book, everything (e.g., Grace) became a bit too obvious, and much sooner than it should have been."
5,Magnificent Work By An Underappreciated Writer,"Paul Auster is both one of the best writers around and also one of the most underappreciated. However, he does enjoy a certain cult status with readers who appreciate truly imaginative fiction.The book begins when one Sidney Orr goes out and buys a blue notebook. That does not sound terribly interesting, but its what Orr does with the notebook that makes this book special.Orr writes a novel in the blue notebook purporting to forcast future events. As the novel progresses, it exerts a strange influence on the folks in Orr's life.As the above demonstrates, Oracle Night is a strange work, but its the wonderful writing that makes it hard to put the book down. This is truly a magnificent piece of work."
1,Road(s) to nowhere...,"I wanted to like this book. Especially after reading the description, and other reviews. However, it was a real disappointment. Too many loose ends. Things started, and not fleshed out - not even fleshed out enough to have any relevance to the plot. A plot which really doesn't go anywhere promising. What is wrapped up at the end of the book is a let down. I found the language boring, and the characters a bit cliched and chauvinistic. I found no connection to or believability in the characters or their plights. The book seems to start on a few interesting paths, but never quite pulls anyting substantive together."
1,Horrid piece of work.,"This has to be the worst book i've ever read in my entire life. The story made no sense, had several meaningless stories within the story itself, and it lacked suspense, if there was any to start with. The characters were plain wooden and it didn't evoke any feelings nor thoughts from me. It seemed as if the writer just needed money or something and threw together this piece of incoherent mess."
2,Well-written but almost unbelievably cruel to its characters,"Years ago, Paul Auster wrote a novel called THE MUSIC OF CHANCE, and that phrase sums up all of his novels. In just about every one I've read, chance and circumstance play havoc with his characters' lives, hopes, and dreams. This novel takes that theme to pathological extremes. In these pages Auster is almost unbelievably cruel to his characters. Not one person in this book escapes its pages unscathed. Malign chance waits at every turn to blight his characters' lives. And, as if that is not enough, not one person in this book behaves with any kind of reliability, consistency, or coherence. Line for line, Paul Auster writes clean, tight, often gripping prose, as he always does. But this grotesque exercise in narrative sadism may well leave you feeling battered and degraded."
4,thank you digital remastering,"These are great disks. Very enjoyable. Great energy through the show, some nice little nuggets of jams between songs, not too much fiddling around between songs. Occationally sounds echoy to me but maybe that was my speakers. The remastering did cause Donna Jean's vocals to be evened out, and in some places she is there but noticably quieter than other shows from this era. I think it makes the recording better, cause you never get shocked by the screeching that sometimes occurs from her. I like that."
3,Not An Essential Dead Album,"This is not a bad album, it's just rather lacklustre at times. Not one of the essential Dead live CDs. The 'Dark Star' isn't a patch on those recorded during 1969-74. Perhaps the cause is Keith Godchaux, whose piano-playing is little more than comping in the background, holding the band back. (His lack of enthusiasm may be explained by means of the picture in the CD booklet with Godchaux's wife Donna and Bob Weir in a close embrace!) Dick's Picks Volumes 15 and 18 has this line-up of the band in a better form. To hear Godchaux at his brilliant best, listen to the band's live 1972-74 CDs."
4,CLOSING OF WINTERLAND-GREATFUL DEAD,"Heard part of this concert on GD station on satellite radio, had to have it. Worth adding to any GD collection."
5,Something Like Elements of Style for MBAs,"This 105-page jewel by two seasoned advertising executives is something like Elements of Style, but aimed mostly at someone writing for business purposes (e.g., one of the ten chapters is ""How to get people to send you money"". There is a useful afterword describing a dozen more books to help you write better. Recommended as a good starting point for any business person wanting to write more effectively."
2,God Damn the Eighties!,Bought this for a friend and watched some of it.My friend liked it.Sometimes other people have tastes that you'll never understand.I found it nauseating.
3,The editing is awful,"Well, the mini series was fun to watch but unfortunately, the producers of the DVD had no respect for the buyers. Indeed, on disc one, you get episode 1 and the beginning of episode 2 without opening credits. Then on disc 2, you get the rest of episode 2 and episode 3 without opening credits again.I think this is pure disrespect."
5,"""If tomorrow comes""- a great mini series!","I remember first watching ""If tomorrow comes"" on TV several years ago. I was fascinated by the exiting storyline and the strong performances by Tom Berenger and Mandy Smith. A must-see mini series!"
4,Best Movie Ever,This movie keeps you glued to your seat from the very beginning and is better than the book. Tom Berringer and Madelyn Smith are convincing in their roles. I just wish that this movie would be re-released SOON!
2,GEE!!!!!,If I didn't love Sidney Sheldon I would have turned this off. The female lead was such a terrible actress I cringed everytime she got an expression on her face. I don't write many reviews but felt I should warn anyone who wants to purchase this dvd. All the male actors were great and the story was great of course. But I had a hard time finishing the film. Don't waste your money. Read the book.
3,Not Satisfied With The Complete CD!!,"This CD was not a straight through movie, it had breaks in it which I was not expecting. I preferred a straight through movie, thank you."
5,Perfect 80s mini-sereies!,"Yeah! take a trip back or visit for the first time, ""If Tomorrow Comes"". Madolyn Smith is perfect. And seeing a young David Kieth, Liam Neeson, Tom Berrenger is cool, too. Read the book first. Great escapist story!"
4,If tommorrow comes,A lively movie. It's a little dated but the storyline is great. Madolyn Smith and Tom Berenger carry off the comic parts and the drama parts perfectly. I didn't like the music but other than that I really enjoyed watching it.
2,Okay for the price,"It's pretty much a thin bathing suit with no support. The picture is misleading, no padding or structure whatsoever in the bust. It's very skimpy in the bottom so plan on wearing tights or spanks or something if you have ANY flaws or people you don't want to show the bottom of your bottom off to. I am 5'2 size 0,2 and have to take it in in the middle, I can tie the belt in the back it's so large but I often come across this when buying standard costumes so I am not disappointed. Even with being a smaller person the boot covers are super tight, I think they must be made for a child. Because I need the costume I'm not returning it, but if you are looking for something with structure and can afford it, but something else."
3,25% No Good,Out of the 8 disks 2 would not function......I would like to know how I can get two replacement disks as these are not cheap.
2,Iomega Zips,"I ordered the box of 8 and 3 came unformatted. My computer tech tried to format them for me and they are just not formattable. These are not cheap and I was disappointed in the quality. So I have 5 instead of 8 and cannot send back the bad ones--the full 8 have to be sent back (I needed them).This is a dinosaur, but some individuals still like to have that hard disk in the hands and files.It would be nice if Amazon would send me the 3 replacements"
5,Good for 7-11 year olds xD,"I got this when I was 10 (I'm 11 now) and it's a really good book. It's a fairly good challenge, too. I would recommend it for (smart) 7-11 year olds. Not TOO childish, but slightly cheesy. I'm glad I got it though."
5,Grandson loved it,My 8 year old grandson was absorbed by many of the puzzles and games. It gave us something to do together although had to defer to grandpa a couple of times! LOL. Nice to have something non electronic that can be so absorbing.
1,Lasted 1-Year = LT! 350 Trans Am,"I will never buy this again, wore out after a year causing a nasty vibration when the clutch pedal was pressed to the floor with the car rolling while in gear. Maybe mine was dried out because they are self-lubricating. Either way it's junk and not worth saving $10 to have to drop the transmission a year after installation. Buy a high quality bronze or kevlar bushing instead."
1,"Terrible, Obsolete Software!","Warning! Do NOT purchase this software! It is no longer compatible with OS X Lion, refuses to open! Even before Lion, it shows as a small, non expandable screen! For a Visual Dictionary, it is the poorest excuse for a product that I have ever seen."
5,a must have!,"Murphy Dog is not just another fluffy book about dogs or animals. The story is an engaging tale of a real dog doing real dog things. As a special education teacher for first graders, I feel that this book is powerful because the text is rich, yet very easy to relate to. The illustrations transform this great book into an absolutely fabulous book. They enable children to feel Murphy Dog deep in their spirits. This book will give you immense satisfaction at the end of a long day. It is sure to be a book that will make your child plead for you to read ""one more time."" I personally can't wait for the next Murphy Dog book to be available."
3,not what I thought,the date was stamped on this and it doesnt say anything in the description.I didnt want a last years date.
2,I wouldn't buy these again,I got these for my daughter because the handles were bigger. I am not impressed with anything except the handle size. The bristles fall out constantly and don't hold the paint all that well.
4,Much bette than wood handles,"After having the paint chip of off the wooden handled paint brushes, I finally came across these. Much better product, great for kids. Have held up well so far (over a year)."
4,OK brushes but a bit too fat for little hands to hold!,"These are OK but my kids are not comfortable holding these. Just our preference though & we now have my 4 year old son using regular artist brushes. He LOVE to paint.........in fact he just got done with a picture. Other kids might love these though. It's really a hit or miss i guess but worth at least trying it. I'll just pass them on to someone else's kids that might very well love them. :) BTW - We buy Melissa & Doug products all the time. They are great quality products! We own the easel, paper and many other toys. Highly recommended product lines. :)"
2,not advertised as a toy,"I was seeking brite (art) brushes. This came up with art supplies, and yes they are fine for chldren but I was looking for advanced art brushes."
1,Uselss,"I believe there is no way to even turn the watch off and now it's just dead. Whether it is the battery or if it's just broken....who knows? yes it was cheap to buy, but it is completely useless and now I have to feel guilty about adding more to a landfill."
1,Great stopwatch...for 3 mos.,"I gave this stopwatch to my daughter for her birthday and she had a great time using it for 3 mos, then it died. I didn't realize this watch was disposable or I would not have bought it. Don't waste your money."
5,Completely Seductive...,"I totally prefer this CD over their new release (although ""Bad Dreams"" is also an amazing piece of work). Every song on this disc throws you deeper into a seduction. Don't ask me why or how, but it does. I was grabbed by this CD right away and I have a hard time going a day without listening to it. Another reason I prefer this CD is because it was in fact their first release, and I think Mad Child and Prevail had a lot more creative freedom with this disc. I feel the new one was written with pleasing the general public in mind. So anyways, if you're looking for a trip, this disc will do what you need it to. Be prepared to be seduced, assaulted, offended, empowered, and all around messed up all over...Best Tracks: ""Lady Venom,"" ""Assault + Battery,"" ""Out of Range,"" ""Valentine's Day Massacre,"" ""Horrified Nights,"" ""Battleaxe Experiment,"" and ""Consumption."""
3,Not for Beginners,"While the book does deliever on what the title suggests - a guide to the 2000 version requirements, it is definitely not for a reader who is new to ISO and the ISO standards. It almost felt like I started the book after skipping the first several chapters."
2,Not What It Appears To Be,"The title, ""The Very Best of The Archies"" is very misleading. This recording is in fact a CD recording of The Archies second album ""Everything's Archie"", which was later renamed ""Sugar, Sugar - The Archies"". That alone would be very well, as the entire album, to the best of my knowledge, has never been available on CD; but the quality is poor. The sound is somewhat ""dull"". Be prepared to boost your treble on this one. Also, the pitch/speed is way off. Towards the end of the CD, The Archies sound like they were in their 50s when they sang the songs. Be warned; I would suggest looking for other compilations."
4,The Soviet Role in Afghanistan,"This book looks not just at the 1979 Coup and the subsequent Afghan-Soviet War but also provides a history of Soviet involvement in Afghanistan since the October Revolution. Because of its position Afghanistan has always been of interest to the USSR, but the Soviets did not necessarily need or want a communist state there. Because this book dates from 1984 the speculation and some of the analysis is totally out of date but for the relationship of the Soviets to the PDPA it is spot-on. A good read for thos interested in the Soviet-Afghan War, although it is not as in-depth as to justify a high cost for it."
2,"Very outdated, but not useless today","I read this weak book, here in Brazil.This book was writen before the end of war in Afghanistan.This book talks about the ""badal"", the pratice to avenge blood for blood, in Afghanistan.This and islamic fanaticism gave will to fight against former Soviet Union, by the Afghans.This book is divided in three parts:1-Afghanistan before the communist coup.2-The coup of april, 1978 and its consequences.3-Soviet invasion and its consequences.This book also has preface, many references,etc.I don't know if I must give three or just two stars, for this book.After thinking a little, I decided to give just two stars for this book.I alsomust tell you, that this book is very outdated today."
5,Real Women in the Civil War,"This is an unusual novel about the marvelous ways which women gave comfort and love during the civil war, an ode of love as responsibility in the care of others. While many books chronicle the adventures of males during this war, this is the first I have seen to get to the heart of the woman as homemaker, caregiver, and patriot. It is a book you will remember and ponder long after reading. The characters are diverse and stimulating. As fine a work of historical fiction as I have seen. It has everything from sexual abuse, to burying of body parts after surgery, to helping slaves to get north, to family conflicts. Throughout there is the heroism of women. I highly recommend it."
2,Good subject poorly written,"The subject matter is one that should be written about. Gettysburg has a rich and horrible history. Women played a huge role in this battle. But they also did thru out the civil war. I found this story to be confusing. Ms Bell tried to cover to many womens topics for one small book. The book could have been great if she had simplified her story. Did we really have to have, Sybil who seems to switch from a southern Colonels wife to a money grubbing inn keeper while ignoring her wounded husband, who fought for the south but nobody tried to inprison him when the north won the war. There was no consistancy to this book it could have and should have been better."
2,Pixelated,"I was sadly disappointed with the print quality of this book. The cheap, printed in China, desk-top publishing look and feel should have relegated this book to the bargain bin. The added Photoshop effects almost warranted a return item. Nice pics none-the less but save your money, pass it up."
5,Love it!,The photography is superb and the corsets are divine. This is a great inspiration book for any who want to get laced up or make their own. I first borrowed this book at the library and then I had to own one for myself. I love the book and hubby doesn't mind it either ;-)
5,Sad to see it go.,What an endearing show this is. I continue to watch this series over and over and never get tired of it. I sometimes wonder if I need therapy trying to accept that it is only a television show and now it is no longer in production. It's that good and the characters (actors) make it so real and so warming. Series 8 and 9 really keep up the pace with the rest of the series. Never tiring and always fresh and funny. Honestly it does not end leaving you too sad that it is over. Watch it for yourself. You will be glad you did!
1,Not enough mesh to get relief from the smell!,"I bought this pet carrier with high hopes because I liked the shape and size, but alas when it arrived it smelled so terrible (strong chemical -fake leather- something awful smell) that I had to wash my hands after every time I TOUCHED it! I was very surprised and disappointed. If you want to cuddle w/ your dog after having to confine him in a carrier for any length of time, don't buy this! The poor thing will REEK. Also, on the interior of the carrier there is a zipper that holds the hard casing inside the soft shell that broke immediately when I tested it. Now the zipper is open and the hard casing is showing on either side of the zipper head. Over all NOT a good purchase. Stinks so much I can't even find an alternative use."
5,Fantastic! Rufus Rocks!,"This is a great album. I love discovering new music, and Wainwright's album is one of the many reasons why. Finding treasures like this just make me smile.Rufus has a a hint of Gershwin and Porter with their witty lyricism, and lush melodies. His keen ""queer"" sensibility impart both impassioned believer and harden cynic.With songs like ""Foolish Love"" and ""In My Arms"" invoking the both the joy and fear love, Wainwright hits his stride as a man swaggering with romance, bitterness, hope, and faith tied to his heart and offered to the world.""I ain't a soft and sacchrine wannabe. Still I pray to God this song will end happily.""We may not now where any love will take us, but Wainwright makes us acknowledge that even the jaded hope to get there."
5,Megafood is the best vitamin out there!,I have used this and several other vitamins supplements from Megafood. It is the purest and best product out there! It is cold press processed so the foods do not lose their nutrients. They have never bothered my stomach and I have several friends that are hooked on them. I can't remember the last season I caught a cold or flu....
4,An Excellent Expose of the UPCI,"I have a friend who has gotten involved with the UPC and I have done quite a bit research on the UPC. I thought that this book would help me to get a more solid understanding of the UPC and its beliefs and practices. I wasn't disappointed.this book was very eye opening for my personally. I found it to be very well documented and I liked that it drew from interviews and Oneness writings rather than just rumor. This book is well worth reading both for Oneness believers and for those, like me, who just want to have a better understanding of the beliefs and practices of the UPC. The only problem I had with this book was all the footnotes. I found myself getting bogged down and by the end, I just skipped most of the footnotes. I was impressed with how well documented all the information was. The author doesn't expect his reader to just take his word for things. I highly recommend this book."
2,Fudge's UPC Roots,"Dr. Fudge not only grew up in a UPC church, his father and mother remain active members in a local UPC assembly. I think this is pertinent information one should understand when perusing his book."
3,I guess 12 out of 15 ain't bad,"Good thing there are 15 songs on this CD because the otherwise excellent music is marred by three awful hip-hop/rap garbage. I guess Ray, Goodman and Brown are trying to show us that they are not over the hill. What they show us instead is how jarringly bad today's ""music"" is compared to yesterday's."
1,Doesn't really work,I used this shampoo for years in hopes of lightening my dark blonde hair. When they discontinued it I thought maybe my life would be over and I should go shave my head or chop it off or something. Instead I bought a bunch off of Amazon. What I soon realized was that it had been drying out my hair like crazy and the conditioner for it sucked as well. I've since switched to Herbal Essences and am quite happy.
5,Killer Chorus Pedal,"This is one hell of a chorus pedal, and i can see why Slash approves. The Bass and Treble EQ make this pedal extremely versatile, and the low freqency cut creates tones that sing to angels (or demons). One thing i immediately noticed about this pedal was the light that comes on when you switch on the effect, it pulses to how the chorus is sounding so you know exactly what your sound ""looks"" like. You can go from very subtle chorus to outrageous almost vibrato-like sounds. This pedal does take a while to get used to, but once you figure out how each knob works, you can get pretty much any sound you want. And this is a stereo pedal so i can be split into 2 amps and makes your sound even more awesome. This pedal is well worth the money and it is made extremely well."
3,Good chorus pedal,Chorus pedals are all pretty much the same to me but this one has some good features that makes it stand out a bit more than the rest. I honestly much prefer using my univibe and haven't even used this pedal since after I tried it out. Good pedal for a chorus pedal though.
5,Excellent Insight and Ideas,"This is about how American lives could, and ought, to be better than they are - how we can more wisely use our affluence to be happier and at the same time cut back on materialism. Also discusses the decline of sense of community and our tendency as a culture to try and fill that need for connection with material items, to our spiritual and environmental loss. A fascinating book with some good theories about why we are where we are, and what we can do to fix it."
4,Great Read-Aoud,"Bess And The Sphinx is the semi-autobiographical account of the author's travels in Egypt as a young girl. The year is 1899 so her travel experiences are radically different from those of our era. After sailing on a great ocean liner and touring Western Europe, the story concentrates on Egypt through a little girl's eyes. Actually, the travel experiences of Bess and her family are worth the read, just by themselves. It is quite well-written, but in a gentler style. There are biblical references at times and a general Christian overtone.Read-aloud for K-5 and independent read for grades 2-5. I could easily give this a 4.5* rating as it was a very good book."

4,Powerfully relevant for complex organizations,"Many useful insights into the dynamic processes that will inevitably lead to catastrophic failure. Scholarly, well researched and well presented. At times repetitive but the ""ah hah"" moments are worth the effort."
5,Excellent Book,This book was an excellent review of the factors that led to such a tragedy. Very thorough and incisive. Highly recommend.
3,grilling salt,"I have not used very much of it, so really not sure other than does not seem to be ripping different"
4,A great refreshing independent movie,The movie is great fun and although you kind off know what is going to happen in the end you still enjoy the ride.Some of the scenes are hilarious and the acting is top notch.Also particularly good was the end which left you thinking about what must have happened and I'm sure everyone will have a opinion as to what really happened.A great movie and a must watch for everyone who is urban Indian especially.
5,Good review of Cayce material,"Although Dr. Thurston has a patent manner of writing, with most books having a very similiar format, this book's content is excellent. The concept of the ""Ideal"" in the Cayce readings is without doubt the single most important function in a person's life and was the central tenet of most of the life readings. The relation of the soul to their purpose becomes active when and only when there is consideration and meditation on this core directive. Dr. Thurston approaches this heady subject, which oft times is difficult to navigate in thousands of readings through multiple channels (ie purpose, destiny, talents..), as well as Cayce contemporaries Jung and most importantly Guirdjeff's use of Self-Observation (which Cayce referred more than one curious soul to study).All in all, a very good book, with some good ideas."
4,Negotiating Rationally,"The book was what I needed for a program we had, but shipping needs to be improved. To order a large quantity of books and receive them piece meal over two weeks in ridulous."
4,Excellent resource for the new or experienced negotiator.,"I recently took Max's Negotiating Strategies course at Northwestern. Much of the class material is taken from his research in this book. He covers the potential pitfalls, offers alternatives, and them applies these in a very readable format. He uses illustrations and cases affectively to challenge one to think through the negotiating situation."
2,Dissappointing,"Negotiating Rationally seemes promising but falls short. It provides food for thought on the interface between distributive and integrative bargaining and on biases that get in the way of a good solution. But as a framework for negotiation, Negotiating Rationally is inadequate. Getting to Yes is a far better structure and is easier to understand -- both for the novice and the experienced negotiator."
5,Underrated,"If you really want to study negotiation, this book teaches you how to adjust your adjust your perception to be far more effective in decisions and negotiating. So many people need this advice which makes it important to learn! It allows you to understand how people think when they make poor decisions and analysis. After reading this I found myself saying, ""What information did you use to make that assessment?"" This is really great for the serious and humble negotiating student."
2,Not as pictured,"The mitts that came aren't like the picture. They aren't flared at the cuff like the picture, and I can't get them on when I'm wearing a sweater. They are brown, not silver. They are nice and thick and extremely long (too long), though. Disappointing."
2,"It's fun, but it adds a measly four new levels to the game","The Postal Special Delivery Expansion Pack is ultimately disappointing for two reasons: it adds nothing to the Postal gaming experience (just more of the same) and, more importantly, there's very little to it - all you get are four new levels. Those new levels are fun, especially the first one where you go crazy inside a large retail store, shouting your displeasure at the store's refusal to sell Postal, but - well, you just can't get around the fact that there are only four of them. In less than twenty minutes, you can do and see everything this expansion pack has to offer. These four levels really should have been included in the original Postal game. I would be embarrassed to put out such an insubstantial product. Even if you love Postal, you'll feel like kicking yourself if you invest any funds in this expansion pack."
4,Excellent introduction to video compression techniques,"Definitely, an excellent introductory book on video compressionfundamentals. The book is very well written in a simple and clearway. It explains the basics of audio, image and video compression techniques, with a minimum of math. However, you won't find detailed implementation issues, and it has some mismatches in the examples and in the formulas used. If you know nothing or little about video compression and you don't want to mess with complicated math, this is the book you should read."
2,"Definitely for beginners, leaving many details out","This book is definitely NOT for anyone above a beginner interested in the techniques of MPEG video compression. It is at least organized well, starting off with information theory, then JPEG and finally MPEG-1 & 2 compression. However, the book gets more vague as you work through it. I was mostly satisified with the sections on information theory, but I found it starting to lack with JPEG and finally very lacking and vague with MPEG compression. Phrases like ""beyond the scope of this book"" cropped up more and more. I am very familiar with communication theory so I could fill in many of the details, but beginners will have to take many of the concepts for granted."
3,Hit and miss.,"I enjoyed a number of the writings in this book. I have read all the American Nature Writing series books over the past years except for the first year (1994?). In my opinion, when this series was published by Sierra Club Books, the writing was better. The last year of the Sierra Club published books was 1998. I highly recommend that a person interested in nature writing seek out these out-of-print volumes. The books published by the Oregon State Univ. in this series were hit and miss for me - and there were a lot of misses."
5,"Plush, cozy, dog loves it","Great little bed. Our dog loves the bed and finds it cozy. He told me so himself!It's well made, soft, and the sides hold up well. We have a reasonably large 14-week Lab puppy in it. Plus, the fluffy section is an insert that can be removed for cleaning.Bottom line, I would purchase this again. In fact, I wish they made a larger one for when our puppy gets older."
3,"Great, but download new firmware first...","Pro: Very fast setting up to get wireless connection and the speed was pretty good at 24-36 Mbps.Con: But I have no luck connecting it to my broadband cable ISP for over 90 min of fruitless tweaking (I'm an IT guy and consider myself geek), I decided to give it a shot upgrading firmware before calling up the tech support... Bingo, it worked!Con: One reason it took me over 90 min troubleshooting... almost every configuration change requires a router reboot! It certainly beats Microsoft, Netgear, and Linksys on that.Con: Btw, you can't forward a range of ports to a specific host, you have to specify port by port.Con: if you want to secure your network by using MAC address filter to prohibit unauthorized access, you have to put in the MAC of your wireless clients, as well as the MAC of the wired clients. I don't know why D-Link would consider wired eithernet client a risk.Pro: But once you set it up properly, the router works fine."
1,"Poor wireless signal, have to restart router every 15mins","Restart router every 15 minutes... I use SBC Yahoo DSL, I dont know if it's the reason (as some guy mentioned above)... no internet so I have to restart the router.Wireless signal is sooo unstable. I use the USB wireless adapter included in the kit. Even though the router& adapter is 1 meter from each other, signal still weak, speed varies from 11 to 54mbps.LOL... far to be as good as my current 2 year old Belkin wireless 54G router.Bought this poor stuff just because want to give my mum one.(PS. here we go... I pressed to send this review... but have to restart the router first... to re-connect to internet :(((("
2,Problems with Connection,"The router itself seems ok. BUT, when using the USB adapter, the signal is very very very weak. My computer is one room away, about 20 feet and the signal is almost non-existent. When I do connect, the signal often becomes lost and I have to restart the router. I'm not sure yet if it's because I have Yahoo DSL like someone else mentioned, or the USB adapter is just bad."
3,It's not that good...,"Could be better, but for the price, it's pretty good. I prefere netgear the signal is much stronger.If you don't want to be too far way from the router, it's work fine."
2,Disappointing and Biased,"With so many other good books covering the glorious age of fighting sail, this work was perhaps bound to suffer by comparison. The pro-English bias reduces its rating further, however. Of all the frigate actions of the War of 1812, for example, the author treats in detail only the brief duel between the Shannon and the Chesapeake, for no better reason than because it was an English victory over an American ship. The author also repeats all the old English excuses for losing so many actions with the Americans, excuses which Teddy Roosevelt demolished one hundred years ago in his own naval history of the War of 1812. Not worth the money."
3,Not Bad for Price,"For the price its not that bad. Was hoping for something a little better though. The materials used for amp part seem a bit shoddy. If something in your trunk hits it the wrong way the knobs can easily break off must practice caution when placing things around it. Also, there is no fuse on amplifier part which I thought was odd. I don't expect it to last very long but for the price its not to risky or wasteful."
4,great startup sub,This is an awesome subwoofer for beginners. I knew practically nothing about hooking them up and didnt have much trouble. If you put this sub in a small four door or coupe you'll get a lot of boom for your buck! I wouldn't recommend putting this in a SUV unless you don't want hear it. I put this in the backseat of my Alero and it makes the coupe shake pretty good. I have only two problems with this sub...1) there is no fuse or protection light on the amp.2) the gain and frequency knobs don't really have a big affect on the bass unless you turn them up all the way but then you just get really bad feedback....But for its price its a great deal and i can't complain.
2,Disappointing amount of sound for the size,"While this product has a nice package and is very easy to install, overall output is far below what I expected for the size and wattage."
3,It's what you paid for it,"I purchased this 2 1/2 years ago and installed it myself. While it did add bass to my system it is still not very powerful. I drive a buick century and I ended up placing the speaker in the back seat because it could not be heard while it was in the trunk. This is definitely not a very powerful system but it does add adequate bass for what you pay for it. I see that the price has gone up because it was only $50 when I bought it. Also, the lights went out in 6 months, and as someone mentioned earlier the parts on the back of the amplifier do bend easily. I recently e-mailed them and the amplifier for the system is 250 Watts RMS in case anyone is wonderingOverall it is a good starter bass tube and I and it sounds good with the enclosure."
2,"Decent upgrade for bass, not alot of sound","I have not been a fan of this brand for a while. I used to do competition stereo back in my younger days. My wife wanted a simple add on for her stock stereo and I had loaned her my 1200 watt system until my car was fixed. She was very disappointed had being used to the fuller, richer bass. The amp, is over rated, its not 500 watts, maybe 300 or less. Decent, cheap add on for small bass gains, but you have to crank the amp to full power to hear it. Save your money, get a decent subwoofer, small amp, and build your own box for just a little more!"
2,Not that great,"I really liked Tanya Huff's Heart of Valor and Summon the Keeper series, and Wizard of the Grove as well, though I haven't really gotten into the Blood Books. But this collection of her earlier short stories just isn't that great, pretty unremarkable and forgettable. I'm not sure if I regret buying it, but I'm going to donate it to the local library. If you can read it for free it's not that bad."
1,This may be my last order from Amazon...very dissapointed.,"Classic Slipcovers Heavy Microsuede Pillow, Sage (Kitchen)Reading customer reviews I was under impression this was a two pillow pack so ordered sage and capp. expecting to receive four pillows. When only one each arrived I was very dissapointed. For price paid wasn't expecting super high quality, just super value - especially from Amazon. BIG LET DOWN....not worth the price charged/paid. I had some more comments about this experience but it was deemed inappropriate for this medium."
4,great size,"love the color, exactly what photo showed, received it quickly, fits all my chairs for that back support for whomever may need it."
1,"Nice color, poor filling","The color and texture of the fabric are very nice, however the filling is lumpy. I'd pay more for a pillow like this that had a thicker fabric and down filling. I'll keep looking."
3,Nice but not for puppies,This is really nice and great quality for the money. Unfortunately our 7 month old Labrador chewed the zipper and the foam pad on the second night. We had to throw it away. Should be great for non-chewers though!
1,1894 (but up to date),"amazing,this sandwich cookbook from 1894 is so up to date.put up apot of coffee.get out your silver tea set.craft these sandwiches and enjoy."
5,Cute little car,"The Loving Family convertible is a cute little car. It comes with a girl and dog. The trunk opens--and occasionally the trunk lid comes off, but it snaps back on easily. Unfortunately, the back seat is too little for anyone but the dog and baby to sit in--which frustrates my three-year-old. Other than that, it's a good toy."
4,entertaining and informative,"This book depicts a future in which the Vatican has its own planet and has recognized the existence of Christs on other planets, reality television has evolved to three-dimensional, recordings of experience called ""senso,"" and a con man native to a backward planet is passing himself off as a divine figure. The story follows multiple convoluted threads which ultimately connect back in a cohesive whole; along the way are some historical details of Christianity, Catholicism, and Mormonism, and amusing and interesting extrapolations. I'm looking forward to the sequel."
4,Joseph Smith is rolling over in his grave...,"Tom Flynn's book is what I would call a high farce; the work can be taken on so many levels. There are the bad puns and black comedy, there is also a level of sadness because so many people in today's world are like the characters in the book, believers in anything as long as there is a sense of community; or just plain out for themselves. I liken this work as similar to Aspirin's ""Myth"" series or Adams' ""Hitchhikers"" series, because it has it's funny moments, and then pages later you are in wonder. The gadgets are very interesting, and the dialogues between the ""gods"" and their followers are very amusing, to the point where I was laughing out loud."
3,"Enjoyable, humorous and mildly flawed","I found this book quite enjoyable despite being flawed in several areas. This book added some very interesting future technologies and scenarios to the sci-fi world. It tackled scenarios such as what should an advanced civilization do if it came upon a planet of a less advanced civilization. Should they interfere or let them develop on their normal course. In this book they decide it is against the law to interfere but yet they have spectators with high tech equipment infiltrate the primitives and millions watch these broadcasts as voyeurs. While there were some very interesting ideas and some sacred cows destroyed, the book seemed a bit long and aimless in place. But it was an enjoyable read nonetheless."
4,The handcuff standard!,"These are fantastic cuffs. You can't beat the performance for this price. If you already have a pair of hinged cuffs and simply need a more flexible pair to use for other duties, the Model 100 should be at the top of your list."
1,scale scoop,they sent me the wrong thing i ordered this scale scoop and they sent me the one with the arm and pan i like to get what i order not what they want to send me but its ok the govenment does the same promise this and give you what they want
5,Perfect match for my laptop!,"I have an 12'' HP tx1320us tablet pc....this case is perfect for it! My mouse fits perfectly in one of it's compartments, cables for the AC adapter fit in the right compartment, my Ipod in another......it has space for all the gadgets you buy and it's really been designed for a person who travels a lot....it's weight is perfect..Recommended 100%"
5,Bag of my dreams,awesome bag i kept my pavilion tx1220 always safe and a lot of compartiments to keep everything in place i recommend it!
2,You get what you pay for.,"It looks nothing like pictured and is possibly the cheapest excuse for ""microsuede"" I have ever felt... It's like dollar store microsuede if there ever was any. It's not horrible, but it's definitely not what I was expecting. You can't find great couch covers for cheap, just spend the extra money!"
3,Good basic guide to Openview,"I will preface this review with the fact that I have about 3 years experience with Openview, mostly basic install and use. I have attended the one week HP course as well. This book provides the beginner with a great amount of knowledge not included in the manuals, but you still seem to need a good network management consultant to get into the real gravy of Openview."
1,NNM is harder to maintain than Windows NT. . .,"I have been maintaining NNM for about 4 years now and I found this book to lack any real substance that could be applied to a real world environment inside a company of the enterprise or carrier class. It was more his personal experience with very little detail on how he accomplished his feats. It read more as an overview of what should be done with no real influence towards how it would be done. Anyone seriously deploying NNM on a network with greater then 1000 network devices would need a book that gave real world examples of how to accomplish certain things (HSRP problems, incorrect dns names, invalid snmp community strings etc.) not just a guide for what to expect."
3,This set is not what you might think,"From the title you might think this is a set of Roy Rogers, Dale Evans and Sons of the Pioneers songs. It is and it isn't. One CD has Roy and Dale. The other two CD's have songs by the Sons of the Poineers. Dale sings one number--'Texas for Me'--and Roy and Dale sing 'Happy Trails.' 'Lore of the West' is a song directed toward children. If you are looking for Roy Roger and Dale Evans, I think you may be disappointed. The 2 CD's by the Sons of the Pioneers are good. From the album set cover, one gets the impression this is a Roy Rogers set and it is not."
3,love the texture,"I love the texture to this item but remember that 2mm is very small. I really wanted something a bit bigger but that is my fault, not the company's."
4,Very good chain,"Even though it is not quite what we expected (we thought it would be thicker - very difficult to judge from a picture)it is actually quite nice. It complements the silver dragon pendant that it was bought for, and, on second thought, it is actually better than a thicker chain would have been. A larger chain would have taken away from the actual pendant, and this is very like it in colour, so it blends well. My son is pleased with it, and happy that he can again wear his dragon pendant since he was born in the year of the dragon."
3,Simple Chain,This chain has a very nice design that drew me to it from the moment I saw it. I enjoy the way it looks and feels when paired with the silver pendant I have for it.
2,Lasted 8 wears,"Chain had a nice weight/feel to it. But (as other reviews state) it lasted about 8 wears. Then snapped. Used it with a small light pendant. But as I took it off, I looked at it and it appeared to have a hole in it. I went to look at the hole/chain closer, and it just snapped in two. Not at the clasp or ring... the chain itself. Only wore it to hang out, so nothing extremely active or anything going on. Waste"
2,flimsy clasp,"The chain is nice enough, but I only got it around the first of December and already the little ring that attaches the chain to the clasp has fallen off and I almost lost the chain AND the pendant I had on it. I would have expected the chain to last longer than 2 months!"
3,Didn't last long...,Loved this chain when I received it but the lobster claw clasp broke in my hand after only two months of daily wear. Great looking chain but not too sturdy.
5,thinner than you think but very nice,"This is a very nice looking chain, just be aware that it is more delicate than the enlarged picture. Still a great value and a nicely made chain."
3,you just have to 'see' jewelry before you buy it...,"this is an ok chain. it's good weight for the price but it just doesn't look spectacular. also, it catches on and pulls my wife's hair so she can only wear it when she has hair in a ponytail. it's just one of those cases where the picture is considerably better than the real deal."
4,Great chain for price and practice,Good chain. popcorn style is great alternative to traditional chain links. had one break on me when I pulled a shirt off and it got caught. not the strongest build but fairly durable and good looking. Recommended.
3,it's ok,"My wife bought this chain. The chain is just ok. It's not as heavy and more 'fragile looking' than she would like. She says she'll wear it but, intends to keep looking for another. The clasp is tiny, she wishes it were larger so it would be easier to open and close."
2,popped chain,"I purchased this chain last year, I had worn it only twice and then it just fell off my neck. I was so disappointed. :( It broke in two pieces.It was my favorite chain, I wont buy this style again."
1,Didn't get the order at all nor the explanations,I didn't get my order at all and neither the company provided any explanations as to what had happened.
1,Not what I ordered!!!!!,"I ordered the turbo and got the cheaper weaker 6% ACP. Not at all happy with this ""bait and switch"" operation. The seller is The smile medic. Buyer beware."
5,"Intimate Mozart, a Revelation","Mozart's orchestral works are familiar friends, but his String Quartets are, perhaps, less often performed. The Emerson String Quartet has recorded three of the six String Quartets that Mozart dedicated to Haydn, and the group has made us a wonderful gift. This is one record I will want to play often, as the sound quality is great, even on my old stereo equuipment. A wonderful opportunity to become better acquainted with Mozart in a more intimate setting."
1,DANGEROUS!,"My baby liked these cookies alright and she is the appropriate age for them, HOWEVER, they are TOO SMALL FOR BABIES! The cookies are just small enough that she can easily stuff the whole thing in her mouth. The first time she did this and began to choke I thought it was just a fluke. I had to fish the cookie out of her mouth. The next time I gave her one of the cookies, she did the same thing so I immediately threw the rest of the package away. We have since gone back to buying Earth's Best teething biscuits which are much safer.I wouldn't recommend these to anyone!"
1,Minolta Poor Quality,"I purchased this product and right from the start I had problems with it. It would not download to my computer properly. It would only download 6-7 pictures one time then only 3-4 another, all the time not allowing me to complete the download. I called Minolta tech support and the tech I spoke to knew less then I did. I returned the camera to where I purchased it and was given another one. Right out of the box it did the exact same thing. Again I called Minolta and was told to send the camera to New Jersey. Two NEW camera's and I have to send them to Jersey, come on guys at Minolta. What happened to the name recognition and quality of your products. I will never purchase another Minolta product. I have Canon camera's and have NO PROBLEMS. And what about the tech support, NONE (no help at all). Spend your money on another product."
1,Too hard to use this camera and software!,"Run, don't walk away from Minolta digital cameras. I own the 2300 and it is horrible. The software does not work well and the camera is way too hard to operate for a simple snapshot camera. There is simply no excuse for such a poor job.To top it off, the photo quality is very poor for a 2 million pixel camera. This thing is Junk!Feel free to email me if you have a question. Bryan_Weber@madscape.com"
2,not something I would recommend,"I purchased this product a couple months ago. It does take very nice pics, but, the darkness of the photos is disappointing, as well at the trouble with downloading via the usb port. Even with fresh batteries, an error message pops up. Essentially, you have to quickly download the images, transfer them, and erase them in about 30 seconds, otherwise it won't work. Minolta tech support isn't available when I need them, so that eliminates any help from them. What initially attracted me to this product was the price, and the small size of the camera. However, I am not impressed with it one bit. Suggest spending a little more on a better product, to avoid the frustrations. I am considering selling mine and purchasing a different product from a different manufacturer."
1,Smashing it into bits,"In my last review...I mistakenly typed in ISO setting for the light settings, which has been pointed out and slapped me in the face. I am not a professional photographer, nor do I intend to give the impression that I am one. I did take the time to read the owner's manual, many times in fact. The point remains that this camera is a lousy investment. It is nearly impossible to download pics using the USB port, and I am not about to try the serial port...what would be the use? I sat at my computer one night for 4 hours trying to download pics, using fresh batteries, tried the AC adapter, and reinstalling the software. I am going to buy another camera from a different manufacturer, and I vow never to buy Minolta products again. Spend a little more, avoid the headaches."
2,misleading title,"I saw the title The Complete Guide to the Full Swing. Tina simplified the grip,alignment,squaring the club head, and the beginning of the take-away. Thats all she covered. To me Full Swing should have included from the address,take-away,at the top and then the pre-impact,impact and finished. I guess the title should have been ""The First Half of the Swing "". I got this to help my grandaughter work on her down swing and it felt very short. Totally deceived by the title. I got this thru Championship Production and I am returning it. I wish there was a real Full Swing DVD out there for young girls from Ladies perspective. This is not it!"
4,Does what it's supposed to,"What else can I say that's not in the product description. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. It charges the ipod. I've only had it for a few weeks and used it maybe 2 or three times, so I can't really comment on the longevity of the product. The blue LED looks nice, and the design fits well into the rest of the car's interior. I would recommend this product if you want something practical and not something that looks overly 'TECHY' sticking out of your dash."
3,Great book for a biologist,"Mr. Dover is obvious a brilliant scientist on the cutting edge of genetics. I can't imagaine there are many people more knowledgable on the subject. He also has a flair and humor to his writing. So if the book is substantial and not boring, what is the problem? This book is simply not ""accessable"" as it were.The book is less about Darwin's theory than contemporary theories, including Mr. Dover's own ""molecular drive"" (there is also molecular coevolution, gene conversion, exaptation, neutral drift, etc.) most of which seem quite sound. Unfortunately, and notwithstanding the conversational format of the book, the concepts are abstruse. One would need, at least, a good knowlege of basic genetics (just knowing the doulbe helix is not enough, trust me) to appreciate this book. If you already have a good grasp of ""allelles"" and such, (where they are on chromosomes, how they operate, etc.) this book would be an excellent choice."
3,Interesting literary format,"Although the written correspondence format does make for a more entertaining read in the beginning, I found that it began to drag on and become annoying by about halfway through the book.There are many interesting ideas that I was unfamiliar with that Mr. Dover explains in ways that are easy to understand for somebody that has a little bit of background in biology. His theories on molecular drive and various forms of gene selection were great and I enjoyed the manner in which he explained these ideas.However, I could have done without half a book's worth (slight exaggeration) of slagging on Richard Dawkins. I'm not sure if the author thought it would be ""cute"" to slam his colleague or wanted to try to prove how much better his ideas are, but it all comes across as trite and childish to me. If you are one that hates Dawkins then you might get a chuckle out of it, but if you are somebody who is more interested in science than egos you might end up not finishing this book."
3,Sound - Good; Features - Lacking,"I agree with other reviewers that the sound is quite good with the player. For this price, however, I am disappointed in the shortness of the headphone wire, and the lack of an armband or belt clip with this player. I do not have a ""pocket"" to put this in when I work out or am listening. It is quite frustrating that cheaper players thought ahead of the mobile need for ""attaching"" the player on your belt, and this design did not."
3,Fuzzy picture!,"This could have been best Spartacus of all. This is latest Bolshoi version done in 1991 with Semenyaka instead of Bessmertanova and also different Crassus. But, still with Mukhamedov as Spartacus, possibly even better than his earlier versions. Bilova too, has lost nothing. Still leggy and sultry. But, disappointing in that even though newer version, softer picture! Too bad."
1,Best so far,The best version available today. When is a new production going to be in DVD (and may be in HD)with surround sound? who knows...
1,Not safe on rough ground,"The wheels are well built. They have some adjustments for height but not as many as the original wheels. When my wife used it outside, it hit against inperfections in concrete and would jump much more than the original 5"" wheels. I do not think the small wheels are safe and Amazon agreed to send me a refund."
5,They won me over,I got these years ago from my mother. They are AMAZING! I love the rubber grip handles and they have stayed sharp on their own for about 10 years! Someone bent the tip a little on one of them and I was curious about the potential of replacing them. At this price I think I'll just fix it myself and resharpen them.I prefer Gerber knives for hunting/pocket knives but since owning these I have purchased other Kershaws and they are very high quality. When the time comes I WILL repurchase these.
2,Formulaic,"I managed to plod my way through this book, figuring out the progression and ending way before the story evolved because it is so formulaic. Just not my type of read."
4,love will find a way,great book!!! Really enjoyed the read didnt want to put it down. If you are thinking of reading this book you wont be disappointed. I will read more of her books.
3,A good holiday read,A really light read good for holidays and travelling. Easy to carry on after a snooze. No concentration required.Predictable and uncomplicated. Not too absorbing
3,love will find a way.,I enjoyed reading it but thought it was a little tame. I enjoy something with a little more action. once was enough.
4,worth the read,I've read a lot of B. Freethy and I really like her style. This was another good book from her. My biggest complaint is how long it took them to reconnect. (First the 9 years and then after the death). I was glad to find that Gary was not as bad as I was thinking. A little more chemistry between Dylan and Rachel would have been better. Still worth the read.
4,"Easy, light read","Another good story by Barbara Freethy about love denied, lost and re-found. The characters were interesting but not too overly complicated, so it was easy to get into the story and start rooting for them. I read this book in less than a day and was not at all disappointed. If you're looking for an easy, light, fun read with lots of romance along the way, then this is the book for you."
4,nice read,This was a nice book. It had a twist which I liked and kept my attention fairly well. I like Barbara Freethy's books!
3,Ok read,"I downloaed this book because it was free, I thought ""why not"". It was an OK read, nothing I would ever recommend anyone to buy but it was not bad."
2,A summer beach read,"I find her books entertaining but always predictable - I learn nothing from them. I consider her a ""romance novel"" writer."
4,Love Will find a Way,Average love story. Lite reading. It worked well for one of my books to have on hand for traveling. Easy to pick up and put down
3,kept my attention,"this kept my attention but her books are pretty predictable. so far, this book was the most interesting one. Worth the price...but I found the use of swearing in her book a bit cheesy and unbelievable."
1,Pitiful!,"I have enjoyed so many books from this author, I was sure this one would be no exception, was I wrong! The female lead in this book is so incredibly pitiful, all she does is whine! Her sister is no better, I did not even finish. Don't waste your time!"
5,Love Will Find a Way,This is a second book I've read and thoroughly enjoyed by Barbara Freethy. She makes the stories so lifelike and gives you hope on true love. This book is highly recommended if you enjoy a true love story!
5,Loved it!,This was my first Barbara Freethy book so I was not sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised with the story and the character development. A very good read and easy to get through. I will be reading more of her books.
4,Suspenseful,Kept you wondering what would happen with everyone. Wasa cute love story that makes you wonder about fate in life
4,Sometimes it's better the second time around,Discovering what your marriage was like after it's over can be a hurtful and/or cleansing experience. Things are not always the way they seem.
2,Boring,"I am a big Barbara Freethy fan. I usually really enjoy her books. This one is totally blah. The main female character is weak, tepid, timid, immature and in my opinion just stupid. Her sister would have made a better lead. As a result I'm just not interested in her story. I find myself just skipping whole pages on my kindle just to get to the mystery being solved. I would not recommend this book to anyone although I usually enjoy Freethy's books. This one must have been written as filler for her contract. Boring!!"
3,Expect more,"Ms. Freethy is a good writer. But, she lends herself to too many cliches sometimes. I know this falls under the romance novel, but I find myself attracted to her writing because she has a way of engaging readers with emotions. If she distinguished herself from other ""romance"" novelists by avoiding the unnecessary sack hopping and swearing, her novels would have a following for her being different. Readers are intelligent. They don't need everything spelled out for them. There is a sense of class in leaving things to the imagination. Modern romance writers should take note from timeless romance writers like the Brontes and Austens that left things unsaid."
1,Don't bother,"Perhaps the download was free because I am guessing she is a new author. Her style is amateurish and predictable. I still haven't finished it because it is almost painful to read and I stubbornly try to finish all books I begin because I keep thinking ""it will get better."" No luck so far with this one."
2,Predictable,"Dylan's best friend is dead, and Gary's widow Rachel wants his help finding out whether it was an accident or suicide. Dylan has pined for Rachel for the years. Now it seems the Gary they knew had many secrets, and maybe a secret life.I liked the character Dylan, although he bordered on being so perfect he was one dimensional. Rachel, however, was extremely difficult to root for. As she fights her feelings for Dylan, she treats him terribly.This story was so predictable, and at times boring, I must have picked it up and taken a break 10 times today.On the plus side, the book was well written and I the last 25% of the story was interesting, although the payoff was a let down."
3,Typical but sweet,I thought the story was nice. Very typical but it was a nice read. I would have liked to read more about them together after all of the drama settled down.
3,Love Will Find A Way,"Too many repeats about why they were at a certain point in their lives. It was as if the reader was reading it for the first time on page 100. We all knew her husband died, but it was constantly repeated."
4,Barbara Freethy is a very good writer,A very clever and enjoyable book. Not sappy sweet.She makes the characters very human and believable. I liked the parts where the characters had their own thoughts.
4,Read like a painting,"Freethy ""painted"" a word picture with her pen. Mystery, suspense, love, and human emotions keeps one turning the pages. A good read. Feels like you're there ... among the trees and in the scenes discribed."
4,Love Will Find a Way,"This story was so sweet and I really enjoyed it. I would recommend this for a fun, sweet, and heartfelt read."
3,slightly disappointed,Nice love story but character development was lacking. Would have liked to learn more about Gary and maybe learn things from his perspective.
4,Love will find a way,"I really had a good time reading ""love will find a way "". It was thoroughly enjoyable, and I will read more books from this author."
2,Beware....this book is old,Right away it is evident that this is an older book. The female characters are weak and uninformed. IMO it is unethical to avoid publishing ORIGINAL publish dates. This is a major fault with kindle.
4,Fun Love Story,"This easy read was not a disappointment! I'm a sucker for a good love story, and this did the trick. This book proves that if it's meant to be...then it will be! If you're looking for a love story then this is the book for you!"
2,Love will find a way,Chose this book because I am reading the series and really like the author. Highly recommend this book - I loved it.
3,poor quality control,"first mousepad arrived broken. called amazon and they shipped me out a free replacement. even let me keep the broken one. (one of the connectors on the USB cable was not making contact, a snip here some soldering there, Presto! it works). So now I have two glowing LED mousepad things. the one that arrived ""good"" started to only show one or two colors. then, after only two months it up and dies on me. my ""fixed"" mousepad came in to take its fallen heroes place. again works for 2-3 months before it too came to an early demise. I might also point out that even though I am reviewing the ""Thermaltake"" model, all the mousepads that look similar to this are made by the same cheap chinese company. it is just different branding. Also, the led lights were sort of distracting. never really liked the mousepads anyway. ended up with a cheap ""WowPad"". it fits nicely on my keyboard tray thing and hasn't broken on me yet!"
1,Bought for Personal Finance Class,"Bought this to explain Madoff to my Personal Finance class. It was a total waste of money. I can't believe you all charged me $14 for this. It goes into all kind of detail about the characters' lives. They are irrelevant to the story. It seems like an ego trip for the Jeff Prosserman. I don't care when he married, I wanted to understand Madoff and the hunt to expose him. Very disappointed. As a teacher, I don't have money to waste."
5,GREAT BED,My dogs LOVE IT!! My blue heeler that has NEVER liked a dog bed LOVES this one!!! She would rather sleep on it at night now instead of in bed with us!!!
5,Aquarium Fishes ot the World,I have several aquariums this is one of my favorite resourcesidentifies and describes most fish i come across can't live without it
3,Needs more detail,This book isn't bad but it is really only useful for identifying species. If you need more information on the care and compatibility with other species look somewhere else.
4,Yes and no,"I have used this product many times in the past, and was concerned when it began to disappear from store shelves, and I learned that it was no longer available. I was glad when I saw it available at Amazon -= but alas, was dismayed when the product arrived, and I discovered how small the supply was for the price I paid. Top dollar for a disappearing product - it is at a premium, I guess - and I sadly paid too much for too little.....but I still like the product itself very much, and wish it were back on the shelves!!!"
1,disappointed,I guess the formula has changed and that is the reason we can't find this product in the stores any longer. I was very disappointed with the results. Instead of helping my digestive system work better it made me more irregular than normal. I truly wasted my money.
1,Rip Off,"Looks are deceiving....read carefully, I didn't notice the ""20 servings"" and the bottle appeared to be a good size. It's actually less than 5 inches tall."
5,Not too shabby,"Bought this fan to place above the one that comes in the Armour simply to add some add'l air flow...Not that the PC really needed it...Fits perfectly, works well..."
1,Hard to screw the hard drive in place,It a good idea but very hard to get a screw in a hard drive cause you have put a screw driver with a screw in holes along the sides just to get to the screw hole. If you have big fingers then you have a problem.The Cool Master 4 in 3 is better because you can take the sides off to get to the hard drive screws holes.
5,3.5 inch cage with fan cooler and blue light,Very nice product and if you can get it for less than $25.00 & its a good value for a 3 bay hard drive bay and fan.
3,Great cooling solution,"Worked great for 2 years,,,,,,,,be careful because is not intended for professional use. i had in a server and only worked for 2 years"
3,Not for the novice,"This is not a book for the novice. The author presumes that the reader is familiar with basic astrology i.e. there are no details on how to draw up a chart from first principles given a birth date, time and place. In that sense the title is a bit mis-leading. I can't judge the book from an astrologer's perspective, since (as you have probably gathered by now) I am a novice!"
1,cute cupcakes,"Don't waste your money. Unless you are looking for a micro book (this book is all of two inches square and maybe 25 pages) with cupcakes that would take a master chef to achieve. Granted the price is nice, but this is not at all what I expected. I wanted some ideas for holiday cupcakes that I could make in my kitchen without investing in a whole new cake decorating utensil set."
2,CAMERA BATTERY,"DOESN'T STAY CHARGED AS LONG AS THE ORIGINAL BATTERY DID. I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS SO AFTER I CHARGED IT, I JUST FORGOT ABOUT IT AND WHEN I TOOK IT ON A TRIP (WITHOUT THE CHARGER OF COURSE) THE BATTERY WAS DEAD AND I COULDN'T USE IT. I DEFINETLY CHARGE IT THE NIGHT BEFORE I NEED IT NOW."
1,Battery won't fit,"On 11/16 I bought a Casio Exilim EX-Z80 8MP Digital Camera - Black, additional battery Adorama NP-20 Lithium-Ion Rechargeable Battery for Casio Exilim Series Digital Cameras and Casio Exilim EX-Case7 Leather Business Card Holder Style Universal Camera Case for Exilim EX-S10 Camera (Black). I am quite satisfied with everything with the exception of the battery. Even though offered as a battery for camera I bought, it is of different size and won't fit into my Exilim."
5,worked great - saved money,The battery worked great in my Casio camera. No reason to pay a higher price for the same battery with a different name.
5,The Dalmation Without Any Spots,A wonderful story and beautiful illustrations...a great addition to your library or as a gift.
2,These recordings deserve a proper reissue.,"It's no wonder this set (which was originally released at bargain-basement prices) is fetching a pretty nice price on the used market. There are some wonderful and rightfully famous recordings here. All come from the 78-rpm era, and we would have been better off if Delta would have just played the records and recorded them straight. I don't know what the engineers were hearing when they produced the CDs, but everything sounds pretty horrible. The sound is like everything was recorded with wooden microphones. This is not how the original records sounded, and it is a disservice to all fans of Fiedler to have these recordings misrepresented this way."
5,Great,Awesome little book. I also bought the biology one last semester. It was in great condition and got here in no time. I would recommend this seller and this book.
3,"""You take the good, you take the bad, and then you have..."" two seasons together","While I was thrilled to find that one of my all-time favorite series had finally come out on DVD, I wasn't as happy to learn that Seasons One AND Two had to be purchased together. As many ""Facts of Life"" fans might agree, Season One was horrific. The show was nearly cancelled because there were simply too many girls and too many sprawling storylines, which didn't grasp viewers as well as the second season, when the four girls everyone grew to love - Jo, Natalie, Tootie and Blair - became the focus. I fear that packaging the two seasons as a set was just a marketing ploy, since many people probably wouldn't buy the first season alone."
3,Not as good as I had remembered,"Like many other people, I watched this show when it first came out, and came to know what to expect of the characters. That was part of what made the show funny, you just knew when a character had crossed the line with another one, and you were just waiting for the response. I guess it just wan't as good 2nd time around. I have no problems with the quality of the discs, reproduction, or any of that, but I think you have to really love this show to appreciate it again. It might make VERY good viewing for girls who have never seen it before, though."
4,AS GOOD AS I REMEMBER,Had a blast watching the episodes again... 2nd season is by far superior and was when the show found its voice. Great!
4,good series,"My 12 year old daughter and I really enjoy this series. It's one of her favorite ""old shows"" (after Sabrina the Teenaged Witch)."
3,AMY GIBSON,"margo, played by amy gibson was the best part of the show. she was the best looking character in the show. sure she was rude and snotty, but her looks made her that way. good show. needed to have more of margo in the show."
5,Great book,This book is informative and an assett for anyone wishing to implement the language arts workshop in their classroom.
1,Print on Demand,"Beware of items marked ""authentic"" when really it's a POD (print on demand) poster. Good Graphics, but overpriced as POD."
2,UGGGHHHH,"What a hassle. Plz do not spend your money on this item. It worked perfectly for the first, say 2 days, then the thing would not read a disc. I would put a disc into the CD MP3 player and it sounded like it was loading, then all of a sudden, on the Tiny LCD screen it read 'No Disc.' i tried 5 other cds, no luck. The thing was definetly busted. I threw it against the couch a couple of times, put a CD into it, and it loaded perfectly. If this CD MP3 player had a face it would have a big wide grin on it like it didn't do anything, and that it was innocent. Then i tried to load the same exact CD an hour later after i turned of the CD MP3 player. Guess what, once again, on the tiny LCD screen it read 'No Disc.' If you want to blow your money away, then buy this product. It's not very much, but if you buy something cheap, you will recieve something equally as cheap. Take it from me, buy the SP-90 instead."
2,I'll give it a few days,"I just got the SP50 in today. So far, I'm disappointed. I bought it to replace an off-brand 2.5"" hard drive player, that wouldn't hold a charge or recharge well.I recorded a full CD, with one folder of sixty tracks, and the rest in the root directory. The sound quality is decent, after I realized I needed to plug my cassette adapter into the headphone jack instead of line out (it sounded awful when plugged into line out).But navigation is a pain. I haven't figured out how to get to my other folder, except by browsing in reverse from the first song. The major problem is that after song 60 or so, it just won't read the MP3s, at least in the time I considered reasonable. It just spun and spun, and never actually played the songs from 61-80 (except for 65).I will keep it for about a week. If I'm not happier then, I may try to return it for something else."
1,Apparantly commonly defective,"I purchased a RioVolt SP-50 today and promptly returned it. I played several MP3 CD's and consistantly had the same audio problem: an occasional ""chirp"" (for lack of a better description) coming through primarily the right channel. I then tested several MP3 CD's with the same material in the SP-50 and other CD players. The SP-50 was the only one that displayed that defect. ... The Rio, save the audio glitch, was a little louder and less noisy. ..."
4,RioVolt SP50 is the best MP3 bargain around,"I'm deployed overseas and was looking for a bargain CD/MP3 player before I left, since I didn't want to take my valuable CD collection with me. In a nutshell, I bought this player...It works flawlessly. I play 128k MP3 files on CD. Batteries? I use NiMH exclusively. They last long enough. I always have another set in the charger ready to go. Skipping? Not yet. It works perfectly. I agree it takes some time to figure out the menu system but it can be mastered... The display has all the info you need. There is no player on the market that can match this one for performance and price in my opinion."
2,Multiple Problems,"Functionality is good, but quality or quality control is very poor. Headphones were very poor, had bad tonal quality, and one buzzed irritatingly w/ resonances. Tone quality was good with quality headphones. Player exhibited extremely high noise levels while playing CDDA disks and right channel ""chirping"" noise during MP3 playback. Battery life seemed poor, although no quantitive measure was made. If you purchase this player, test it carefully before you throw away the packaging!"
1,"Poor performance on MP3s, and also not as advertised","I was very disapppointed in the RioVolt SP50. It simply does not work correctly (at least the unit I got) with MP3 CDs. It puts extraneous thumps and other noises on top of the music. A different reviewer said that this didn't happen with bitrates of 160 kpbs or lower, but it happened frequently for me at 160 kpbs. Also, it has trouble with long tracks; it mysteriously stopped, and would not restart, at about 57 minutes into a 5 hour track. (The same CD plays fine on another brand player and on my computer, to answer the question you might be about to ask.)So it's going back.Also, the web site claims that ""you'll find an AC/DC adapter in the box"", and that the unit includes a remote and is ""bundled with RealNetworks music management software and Adaptec CD-burning software"". Surprisingly, mine was shipped with none of these items. I would not have purchased it had I known that."
1,...,"You get what you pay for with this player. It's the cheapest one I could find and it showed. I returned it immediately. The build quality is horrible and it skipped while sitting on the coffee table. I was so disappointed that rather than tacking on [more money] to see what that gets me, ... I got the Sony 901 and it is excellent."
3,"Good MP3 player, but not great","This is a rather basic player, but it does play MP3's from folders and subfolders and allows you to navigate around to find the song you like to hear.But I've been having some problems reading some of my MP3 discs. I'm not sure if it's my CD writer, the MP3 file itself or this player. The MP3 songs will play for the first 10 seconds, and stops dead. The very same disc will play no problem on my pc.And because it uses a non-standard sized power jack, I couldn't use my existing portable CD power adaptor for it even though it is the same voltae and polarity. I view this as a disadvantage because I already have the home and car power supplies for my other portable CD players.There're other ""noname"" brands out there that could play MP3, WMA, VCDs and even has FM/AM radio built-in for slightly more. With the glitches I've experienced, the only thing that's still good about this player is the Rio brandname (which by the way has already been sold, now known as Sonic Blue)."
1,ok player but horrible customer service,"I have purchased a few rio products over the past few years and have found them to be decent but not great quality. the anti-skip technology on their cd players has been completely atrocious, playing cd's or mp3-cd's i can barely walk around without skipping.but i would never recommend buying anything from this company because their customer service is the worst that i've ever seen. e-mailing them i get a form letter back saying to respond to it if my questions weren't answered, and every time i responded i got the exact same form letter back.800 numbers are non-existant and i was never able to reach any customer service or get any help with my problems with the product.overall ok product with the worst customer support ever."
5,Good Value for the money,"I have had this unit for 4 months now. It has never balked at any mp3 cd's I've used. CD playback, again works fine. ESP works fine. I can recommend it whole-heartedly. Many of these reviews have been rather harsh; your expectations may be too high. You won't get audiophile quality out of something that's this inexpensive. I have used its line out jack with my home theater system and the sound quality was acceptable.Get a good set of headphones, do a good job of burning your mp3 cds and I think you'll enjoy this player."
4,Cheap and it works,"OK, a few things that the description for the SP50 lies about:1. The display is not backlit.2. You can not add a remote.3. There is no EQ.4. It does not come with burning software, but you can use anything that can burn a MP3 CD (most any good burning software).That aside, this is a good, cheap player. Navigation is a little sketchy, you have to select a track in a folder to jump to that folder, but the manual doesn't tell you this. The CD comes to a complete stop during MP3 playback, and spins back up every 120 seconds to save batteries. If it's not spinning, you have to wait about 3 seconds for it to spin up and get data. Most players do this, even the iPod does it (it has a hard drive so it kind of has to). Throw away the included earbuds, they [are poor quality], which is typical.If you need a cheap player that you don't care if it gets dropped/smashed/soaked in napalm and set ablaze, and can play MP3's, get this player. It even comes wih batteries."
1,Such a bad low-end mp3 player,"I hope I could return it to the store. This item is flimsy. Buttons are small. The search function is useless. The worst thing is its compatibility with variable bitrate streams. I compressed most of my CD's into variable bitrate mp3 files since this is the most efficient and high-Q way of compression. However, this player continuously makes hissing sound when dealing with variable bitrates. If you stick to constant bitrates like 128kbps, 196kbps, this player is ok, considering its low price. I don't recommend saving $50 and tolerating the lousy playback of this player for years. Go get a sony or panasonic."
1,Very Bad Player,"...I made an mp3 cd and tested it. It played very well for the first few songs. However, as the player got futher and deeper into the songs, it would take longer to load. Eventually, near the 40th song, it would be 2 minutes plus to load. It gives no error message or anything so you don't know if it is loading or just stuck. It can't even load up the 200+ songs. Very bad player indeed."
4,Lowpriced player with an accpetable audio quality.,"In general,SP50 is excellent.I use it on my car. It works well even in the poor road conditions.By using rechargeble batteries, it will last about 6-8 hours. I think it will have better perfermance with normal batteries.There is a little noise of the ouput if you listen to the song by earphone. But you cannot feel it by the car audio.Another shortcoming is the poor quality of earphone.Again, it's not a problem for me because I never use it."
3,Does NOT play WMA files,"I can't comment about any other feature of this unit, but IT DOES NOT PLAY WMA FILES as stated above. It does play MP3 files."
1,not portable,"I bought one and returned it. Holding it while walking or putting the player in your pocket causes it to stop playing. You lose your groove and your place on the CD. Sometimes it plays with the display blanked out. I can't imagine how this product got to market. Consider it only if you plan to place it on the sofa or car seat beside you or in your lap. My grandfather used to say, ""You buy cheap, you get cheap."""
1,be prepared to return this item,"this player is a piece of junk. i went through two of them before i gave up and returned it for credit.the first player would stop if you so much as breathed near it. i mean, forget the fact that it is supposed to be portable. if i moved the unit even an inch, it would shut off. thought it was a fluke, and after 1 week exchanged it for another.the second one refused to play certain cds, both MP3 and brand new store bought! then after less than a month i got the NOCDMP3 message and it stopped working altogether. so that one went back too. don't waste your time or money."
2,Good ol white noise,"If you like to hear your songs clearly avoid this player. White noise is present at all volume levels and is rather distracting. The plastic lid doesn't even feel like it will last more than...well let just say it is REALLY weak feeling. Great price with the mail in rebate- only fourty bucks, but I'm still returning mine and getting an IRIVER 350, nice player..and trust me it SOUNDS GREAT!. The 350 even comes with rechargeable batteries! Head towards the IRIVER, away from this SP50"
1,I took it back.....,"The most striking thing about this MP3 player is the cheap construction. The top and bottom of the case didn't line up as well as they should have. In the few days I had it I discovered that it wouldn't play all of my normal CD's, or would not be able to find tracks on them. I returned it to the store....."
2,"It does its job, but that's it","I bought it like two months ago, and I just feel like giving it back again. I mean It works fine, but for a little bit more of money you could get a way better mp3-cd player i believe"
3,very educational,"This is a very good educational toy to teach your child spanish. However, I expected it to be exactly like the english versions abc toys, which sing the alphabet song. This one does not and it does not reference easy words for each letter for toddlers to repeat as the english versions do. But all in all it is a good purchase and useful."
3,3 sectional is H U G E !!,"I must say, the 2 sectional is great for a regular stove top. The 3 sectional might as well be used on an outdoor grill. good buy, though."
3,Pilot Episode Only,"For everyone who was hoping this book spanned the first and only season of Earth 2 and actually finished the story, you're in for a disappointment. The novelization of the 90s tv show only covers the pilot episode.And for those who just wanted ""more"" Earth 2, well, there really isn't much of that either. The conversations at the beginning especially are a little expanded (with Uly's doctor for example) and you get people's thoughts on things but overall the book was not very well written and offered nothing extra. Huge disappointment."
4,Lot's of fun,My 6 year old daughter and I have been having a great time with these two games. My 5 year old son even plays a little. There is mini-golf in the Clock game that he loves to do. The puzzles are much harder than they can do so that is where I step in. It has been really fun for us and the kids are enthralled!
2,Made my PC crash,"I was in the middle of playing ""Secret of the Old Clock"", and the music started looping. Then the PC just hung. The game won't allow me to play it anymore - I get error messages. I contacted HER Interactive, and they acknowledged there's a problem with the game. They're working on fixing it. It doesn't seem to affect everyone's Pc.So, if it doesn't affect your PC, the game was fun. Lots of puzzles, and a car you get to drive around in. I was halfway through the game when it crashed. I dared not try it on another PC, because it really caused alot of damage. Let's just say, data got lost, my husband was able to retrieve some files, but most everything was gone!!"
2,Not great but okay,"i tried it and got bored quickly even though the graphics were great. It isn't fun. I prefer the best which is nba live 2003. So if u wanna buy this, beware."
2,EASY,"This game is alright... for about 20 minutes. Once you get used to it, you can blow teams out by hundreds of points. My created player had 350 points in one game. He averaged about 200 on the season. The other games are much better."
4,Myt review,"Great amp! its a cheap brand but for the price, quality and performance not bad at all. You gotta get it, its worth it."
4,"Very good, excellent sound","What installed in the car with two cornets of 500 wats and a subwoofer 500, sounds good no distortion"
1,I Dont Think So...,My parents bought this amp for my birthday a while back and it packed A LOT of punch for about 3 days until it died for no reason. Amazon replaced it for nothing and the next one died after a week. Not cool :(
2,Good Amp for 3 Months,Worked great for around 3 months then after an hour long trip the amp shut off from overheating. I did have the gain pretty large but after it cooled down it now just sounds like static when I do it even with the gain set to around 1. Pretty big amp and it feels cheap as well. I suggest saving for a better name branded one so you don't waste 50 bucks like I did.
2,OKAY,I bought this amp for my 1000 subwoofer. But I had a very old alpine that was only a 1000 watter I had that hooked up at first and I was very impressed. When I had the arctic pyramid amp installed the bang of my subwoofer dropped significantly. I don't recommend this product because it says its a 1600 watt amplifier but in the small print it explains that it only puts out so many watts per channel which limits its power. The installer at ABC warehouse told me that he wouldn't charge me to hook up another amplifier since I got screwed over.
1,Work,God amp what nothing special ... If u like ri one timekkkkkk jdjdjd djdjd ksjx sjsjs djhdh dhdhd jdjddj jfcj jddj djdj djjd ddj fjdjj djj dj xjj sajsj ddjd ddkc jdjx
1,i wasnt even playing my subs and it stopped working,I had it for 2 weeks and it stopped working out of no where I wasnt even playing the subs. Just one day i went to playem i turned them on and nothen happened.
2,not worth the money,"I bought this product out of desperation thinking that it would remove the tear stains under my puppy's eyes. As far that goes, I might have well have used water and a mild detergent instead, and saved $10.00.I followed directions, used enough product, and even applied the solution on a cloth a few times to clean the area under her eyes in order to make certain I was cleaning well enough, and still noticed very little difference in the appearance of the stains. I do realize that the product must be gentle so it doesn't irritate or inflame the eye area, but this was useless. I'd like a refund, but am not sure this is possible seeing that I ordered through Amazon and not from a store. Don't waste your money."
2,Do not really notice a difference with this,I bought this to clean the tear stains under my Maltipoo's eyes but I really could not tell a difference. I also purchased the same brand of dry powder that you sprinkle on the dog food and think this works much better than this product. I would not buy it again since it doesn't do any better than his regular dog shampoo.
1,Bootleg CD Quality,"As the title indicates, if you are looking for the ""real McCoy"", then don't buy this poor quality sound recording. It's not sponsored by Chicago Records."
2,Large dog bed,"The colors are nice but the quality is lacking. The top side of the bed that has the quilting--lasted about 2 weeks before stuffing started coming out of it. My smaller dog likes to dig/scratch his bed to get it ""just right."" I keep his nails cut but the stitching is now loose. I have it turned over and am using the other side. The outer material is thin and will tear easily and thus I would not recommend this product. There are heavier made products for the same price. I was lured in by the color/quilt design and cannot enjoy it unless I want to look at stuffing all over the house. I will now have to pay someone to sew/repair it or better yet--get a better made product."
2,Mmmmmmm dog bed!,"Size is as described, but the stitching is just ok. This bed did not last long with my dog. Within 2 weeks, the dog had destroyed it.If your dog doesn't chew things then its probably ok, but mine chewed it up very easily."
2,not cedar,"this bed is pretty and a nice size, but i purchased it because it said it had cedar chips in it and it does not."
3,try this dog bed cover,"Noticed that there are comments about the cover falling apart. I have gone through many, many dog beds for one reason or another (dogs are hard on beds, puppies are even harder). I finally found an awesome, inexpensive dog cover. I took the internal stuffing from the ripped/destroyed ones and put it into this cover. They have lasted longer than any others. Because it is a cover with a zipper, you can take out the stuffing and wash the cover easily. The denim is very durable. I bought both the lining (36""X29"" Medium Large Water resist Zipper internal pet bed cover with Taffeta fabric for dog and cat) and the cover (Medium to Large 36""X29"" Durable Tough Jean Pet Bed Cover for Dog & Cat)."
5,Wow. This baby was worth the research time...,"I own a Sony MZ-R70 but I knew it was time to go totally digital for the ease of use and non-skip attribute (for the gym and running). I researched and researched and decided on the Nomad II. What a pleasant surprise! My expectactions were exceeded and that NEVER happens. Although pricey, for me, it is well worth the investment. The software installs easily but admittedly takes a few minutes to figure out how to set up a playlist and download to the Nomad II. But once you get the hang of it, this unit is amazing! The sound quality is incredible. And the volume. Well, it can play louder then even I need. The battery life is excellent. The USB download speeds are a blessing. It's light and cute. I would recommend it to anyone willing to spend the money."
2,Not worth it,"This MP3 player did not live up to my expectations. It constantly jammed; meaning that I had to take the battery out to change a radio station or even move on to the next song. Also, setting radio pre-sets was complicated. Mine actually died only 9 months after purchase. Not exactly the longest living MP3 player."
3,its an ok system,I boughtr mine last year. The first thing to go was the headphones the wire inside breaks easilyso be careful. the headphones will stop working from normal use then there is the whole thing of memory. 64 mb might sound like quite a bit but its never enough.you might get and hour of cd quality music. thats less than a cd. If your gonna spend this kind of money maybe you should look at the nomad jukebox. It has more memory than I would ever use but for 100 dollars more its worth it. not that the nomad II is bad I really like the radio feature except it having a weak antenna. The microphone on the recorder is really bad too but if these features are important go with it. For the money I wish I had gotten the Jukebox but I was in a hurry. choose wisely. Its overall a pretty good player for the money with a few flaws. hope this helps.
2,I slowly began to hate this thing,"It worked fine for about a year. Then it started tweaking like crazy. Every once in a while, I'd have to reset the player because it would randomly act up in the middle of a song. By act up, I mean it starts making this weird loud tone that can't be stopped unless you reset the player."
3,Was looking for an MP-3 that recorded books!,"My son and I could never figure out how to download music or anything else on this mp3 player. I was looking for one to record books on tape. Amazon was amazing, they took the item in return. I'm so glad I ordered it fromt them. When I figure out which one does what I want I will surely order from Amazon again."
2,"I love the game, but...","I was excited, so I had to rush out and buy this game. The first disappointment was finding out that my boyfriend and I would have to take turns on a 100 hour + game!!! After watching the game play, I immediately discovered how incomplete the game really was. It seemed as if the less important NPCs were supposed to have voices. Also, since the character roster can hold 15 characters it seems logical that my boyfriend and I at one time could have shared the game. If you want proof on how incomplete this game is; look at the patch and the fixes it makes. The list is long. However, this ""unsupported patch"" is still not enough to make the game enjoyable. This gives a pretty good idea on how underdeveloped this game really is. I feel as though Activison ripped me off for the second time this month with this game. They should do right by game fans and fix this game. A game I would otherwise worship. This is truly a shame."
2,How can a game so buggy be released?,"This game wants to play well. It invites you to keep playing, but the number of bugs and the size of the bugs makes this game a total failure. One should not have to ""work around"" issues, such as changing resolutions when not being able to surface after swimming under water in one(so far)situation. When you try to surface, the surface of the water behaves like brick wall and you drown, but change to ""software rendering"", shut the game down, restart, and then you can get out! These are things that as players, we should not have to ""figure out"". A friendly NPC blocks your way. You're not supposed to kill him, but you HAVE to if you want to go past him. Supposedly, there is a patch that will allow you to push him out of the way. Doesn't work. What a shame, this game could have been worth it, but as is, don't waste your money."
5,"Beautiful, super-cool industrial beats","This is a great album! combining cool industrial sounds with both male and female vocals across fourteen excellent tracks. Personal favourites include ""everything"", which is a beautiful but hard-hitting industrial epic and ""this fire"", one of the more poppy, but still wonderfully crafted songs. Buy it!!"
4,watchlady,I am satified with the purchase of this Movado watch however it is slightly heavier than I imagined. And a bit larger than I had hoped but a link or two removed will fix the problem caused by my small wrist. Overall the watch is classy and goes from dress casual to formal attire nicely. If your interested in a watch that covers both silver and gold jewelry categories this watch will work well for you.
3,lael is the man!,"good variety of sounds, not bad for a first cd. supermodel stalker, and its hard working front man are going to go somewhere! these kids got talent. keep your eye out for their upcoming cd"
4,Great item!,"I actually went to J&R to listen to this system. It sounded great. For the price, I definitely couldn't pass it up.You get a LOT of quality and options for an amazing price when compared to the other systems. It has a lot of power, clock/timer/alarm, high watts, powerful speakers, plays all CDs, surrround sound, etc. The sound quality is excellent; very clear and crisp, although the bass is a little muddy sometimes.The unit is very sleek and modern looking--very attractive. The wood is a light birch/beech, with silvery/light blue speaker netting covers. The display has many different colors to choose from--I keep mine on violet.I am very pleased with this purchase--especially with the price and quality."
4,Just recieved it,"I was skepitcal about purchasing the RIO EX1000 after reading the many negative comments, but I went ahead and bought one and I am glad I did. I have not had any problems with it so far. MP3's and CD's sound great. The bass is deep and pounds, it can be a little muddy but overall the sound quality is on par. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a MP3 home stereo. Few things that bother me: - forced EQ settings, seperate bass, mid, treeble would be ideal. Digital volume adjustments over Analog. I can not vouch for the system's long term use yet considering I just got it."
5,Great stereo for the money,Nice looking well built Microsystem. I would recomend this system to anyone who wants a nice stereo but doesn't want to pay a arm and leg.
3,noisy cooling fan,"I got the system yesterday. It sounded great at first. Then I noticed some annoying noise from the system. Upon further investigation, it turned out it was coming from a small cooling fan which got activated once the volume was turn above half way (15 on the display; maximum is 30). I could not stand it since when the music was not loud enough I could hear it clearly. I am going to return it. Another complaint is that there is only 2X20 watts of power going into the main speakers which is not a lot."
1,System Didn't Even Last 2 Years!,"I bought this system late in 2001, I thought it had nice features for a little bookshelf system. Almost a year later a speaker capicitor went out, and of course it's a type that I couldn't find anywhere, even in a big city. Tech support was not able to give me the manufacturer, I'm not sure why. Then 6 months later, the left speaker went out. We think it's a short on the board, or something loose. I can't believe this system didn't even last 2 years. I've had other stereo systems that lasted 10! I do NOT recommend this system at all!!"
3,"Best available, but not perfect yet.","I bought this system specifically for the MP3 support and because Rio's Volt is such a good player. Unfortunately, the song navigation of this system is no where near as good as the Volt. You cannot browse by ID3 tags or folder names because the song names are only visible once the song starts playing. The system allows you to rapidly switch from folder to folder or song to song, but you can't tell what they are. I've resigned myself to just using the ""random"" feature which shuffles the whole disk. The presets for the equalizer are slightly confusing as well (what is the difference between ""Samba"" and ""Salsa""?) On the plus side, the sound is great. The subwoofers fill out most songs nicely without being obnoxious. The thing looks wicked cool, too. For the next version it would be nice if it was flash upgradable, like the Volt, allowed viewing of folder names, and had a digital input for the DVD player."
4,Like Brahms? You'll Enjoy Fuchs,"Robert Fuchs is one of those many footnote personalities encountered when reading the lives of the ""great"" composers and names of teachers with whom they studied. Happily for students of German romanticism, many of these heretofore unknown composers are now getting heard and known via CD. Fuchs was well-respected by Brahms who was notoriously hard-to-please when it came to music of his contemporaries. In the case of Fuchs, Brahms sang his praises quite often. Primarily an educator, Fuchs was a modest man who did not actively promote his own work. It's ashame that he did not because, while his music breaks no new ground, it is nonethelesss pleasing and enjoyable to the ear. All three of his symphonies are now available on CD as well as his Piano Concerto and are a must for devotees of unknown 19th Century orchestral output."
3,I guess I expected more from this Lens,"I would have to agree with A. D. Lum's review on this teleconversion lens. I was disappointed with the fact that it isn't that much of an enhancement. I to also expected it to be a ""Wow"" but was also like ""Oh... OK"".There was vignetting when fully zoomed out in the corner to the point where it was very noticeable on my HDR-SR12.It looked great on my camcorder but because of the vignetting and that the lens do not bring me significantly closer to my subject as I expected, I returned it."
2,Know the limitations,"I bought this lens to attach to a Sony HDR-CX700V. The quality of the lens is without question. The problem I have with the lens is when you put the camera in ""wide angle"" mode, a black circle surrounds the picture. You have to set the zoom level to approximately mid-zoom in order to make the black edges disappear. That somewhat limits the use of the lens in my opinion."
4,I like it,"This lens works fine for what it is. On a Sony HDR-CX560 or 700, because the lens goes so wide there is no much leeway before you hit the edges of the lens, but for what it does it's okay, it makes a stronger telephoto without too much CA. Buyer beware that it magnifies camera shake, so use a sturdy tripod."
5,simple,"This was the easiest system to set up ... we were a little concerned when researching for in ground hoops, with reviewers comments stating the difficulty, time, etc involved .... some saying they needed extra help, or it took more than a day to assemble ..... this one my husband put together in less than 2 hours, with the easiest and clearest instructions ever ..... and it took that long because he had to go to the hardware store .... didn't take an army of strong people to put the pole in position either, just 2 adults, and i put in the bolts .... how easy!!! just one thing, instructions called for 12-14 60lb bags of concrete, my husband bought 24 and had to buy a 25th!! ... course, he probably made the hole a little bigger probably, around 50 inches dee by 24 inches wide .... anyway, would recommend the goalsetter allamerican"
1,Should be warned,"This book contains racial slurs and sexually explicit words. Also, there are just a few lines on each page. While I understand these comments come from another era, there should at least be a notation that this book is not for a younger audience. Overall, I'm bothered that I actually paid money for this book. I threw it away."
1,"im confused ,why?","22 minutes?, 1 episode? what is the point of this, i just got the season 6 dvd with 8 episodes. now they want [...] for 22 minutes. what a rip off."
4,Best read aloud by adult to keep the pace...,"Our Grandchildren enjoy the exploits of two rather non-typical children, as long as I read it to them... even got them away from their electronic games! Good to excellent readers over age 10 might be able to keep the pace, but others would get lost in the words and asides. Now that we have had Harry Potter, the British idioms are not as foreign as when our now 26-yr-old tried to read it."
2,Mother of three.,"I bought this umbrella stroller for my third baby. I loved that it reclined and had tall handle bars. However I do have some serious problems with it now that my son is 6 months old. The sun shade is to small, does nothing to keep the sun out. And like the other reviews before, the back has bent into a C shape, it has no back support at all. I am very disappointed in this stroller, it is a total waste of money. I will now go by a $20 umbrella stroller."
3,It's decent enough,"I am disappointed in this stroller. I like it because its very lightweight which I wanted and the 5 point harness is great. BUT its ugly! In the website picture, its nice looking but in real life, its just ugly green and brown. Also I am having a very hard time getting it to latch when its in the folded position. I have since given up on trying to latch it closed. I'll keep it since I don't need it that often and I already tossed the box, but if you're looking for a stroller, keep on looking! Spend the extra money and get something better."
2,Great looking stroller...terribly made!,"After weeks of researching lightweight strollers, I came across this one (at BRU). It had everything I was looking for. It is a great looking stroller with sturdy wheels and long handles (both my husband & I are tall). We bought the stroller & used it on a trip the same weekend. It became quickly apparent that Chicco made a gross error in designing this stroller. The seat is held up by a piece of cardboard which quickly bent when my 11 month old was placed in the stroller. The bending caused him to sit in a position that looked most uncomfortable. We returned the stroller as soon as our trip was over & the kind ladies at BRU were most helpful in taking it back. They were very surprised to see the poor craftsmanship when we pointed it out! I was trying to aviod the cost of a Maclaren, but found out quickly...you get what you pay for! The Volo is a great stroller."
3,Good Design but poorly constructed...!!,"I totally agree with another reviewer in NY about the flimsy back support of this stroller. I'm amazed of how they figure to put sth like a card board, instead of sth strong like a metal sheet. This major short fall alone is enough to throw out all the good value and design that this stroller could have potentially delivered. Hope they fix this ""real"" soon."
4,Good value for money,"We bought this for traveling- would highly recommend it. It is within the airline specs for carry on (gate checked of course) and seems quite sturdy. Occasionally you've got to really pull to fold it up, but it takes the abuse just fine. It also goes through airline xray machines without trouble. The kid inside seems comfortable enough spanning (so far) 9 months to over 2 yrs."
4,lightweight & easy to use,"We recently went on a cruise & needed a lightweight stroller. We considered spending big bucks for a maclaren. Though the maclaren is lightweight no need to spend your money for something short term. My 11 month old loved it. It reclined for his naps (big plus), the storage basket underneath was enough space & dont waste your money on a additional organizer attachment the pouch on the back is sufficient. Its easy to fold, the sun canopy could be larger but we used a sun hat in addition at all times. The front wheels unlock for easy turning, not like your standard umbrella strollers."
2,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"When the package arrived I discovered that the player was NOT 256 MB, BUT RATHER ONLY 128 MB. Amazon refuses to accept responsibility and Discovery Channel (where it was shipped from) blames it on amazon. The customer gets left out in the cold!"
4,Rare Chinese Drama Acceptable For US Production,"Gao Xingjian has written some really provacative interesting drama for performance. The Other Shore is the best play available that presents the atmosphere and message of the horrors of the Maoism and the Cultural Revolution in a way that can be understood by people with no knowledge of Chinese history. Very interesting, Beckett-ish work just waiting to be performed."
3,Try it...,"I read in the NY Times that Gao won a Nobel Prize for Literature, though most of his work is banned by the Chinese government. For this reason alone, I would read it. See NY Times' 10/13/00 article for more on him."
2,Looks Great...Got no soul,"After the bad taste of Wipeout Fusion on the PS2, I was looking forward to this game, but it is only so-so. The visual effects are really amazing (the rain effects and water effects are most impressive) but the gameplay is weak. I find the ships are just too light for my taste (unlike wipeout, where you ""felt"" gravity in the steering), these ships seem just floating like a hockey puck and bounching along the side of the track. While the levels have alot of eye candy, many tracks (or large sections of tracks) are too twisty to actually get a good sense of speed while playing, and while the weapons effects are sharp, you're generally going to fast to actually see them (but it looks pretty in the replay mode). The storyback drop is uttery laughable and distracts from the game. So this is one I'm glad I rented first. Definate showcase of the X-Box's power but not a good example of what I would consider a good game."
4,Fun and Challenging Game,"The graphics are excellent.An extremely fun game to play.The bad part of this game is when you're racing at high speeds and wander off the track the game automatically resets your craft,very irritating.Overall I would prefer Extreme G3 on PS2."
3,Nothing to get excited about.,"Quantum Redshift is a futuristic racing game where you race against other opponents to unlock goodies such as new levels, vehicles, top speeds, characters, etc. The graphics and gameplay are decent, but the game doesn't add much in the way of innovation. The vehicle physics aren't convincing -- the racer pivots along its center and doesn't bank much during sharp turns. Finally, the techno-beat leaves little to be desired. This is definitely a ""rent first"" game."
2,Very Disappointing,"I rented this, and am really glad I didn't pay $ for it!!!! Although the game is kind of fun, in a Star Wars Pod Racer ...-... sort of way, I think it is ridiculous that you have to come in FIRST in every race to advance. That makes the gameplay especially frustrating because on some levels, if you ever fall out of first, you can never regain the lead. Also, the whole ""nemesis"" feature is stupid, although I guess it makes the game more challenging.I guess the only really redeeming thing is that the graphics are good and the sense of speed is accurately conveyed. Otherwise, I can't think of a single reason to spend money on this game."
2,"Curb Appeal, but nothing else","This game is like Budweiser - very well produced product but bland and tasteless. The racing isn't challenging and the gameplay is boring. We tried about 10 races before giving up. It's pretty, and the concept is good, it's just missing something."
1,boring,"at first i was interested in this game because i love futureistic racers (f-zero, extreme-g, etc.) and QR has the custom soundtrack feature. but once i played it i found myself bored in a few minutes so i decided to turn on my custom soundtrack instead of the game's music (low-quality, substandard techno) and the game kept freezing. it played fine without the soundtrack feature but with it on the game froze like crazy. has anyone else had this problem- with this game or any other?"
2,Too confusing,"The game seemed interesting when I bought it. It was really confusing when I started playing it. That was probably why the game was only $20 used. Folks, it is not a good game."
4,Fretboard Knowledge,"This is one of the best sources of Guitar knowledge I have ever seen, and I have bought $1,000's of dollars worth; and I have a BM degree. It isn't a product for the complete beginner, but if you know a little bit about theory -- BUY IT NOW."
5,Guided Imagery for Healing Children and Teens: Wellness Thro,"This book was well thought out and well written, I got great ideas on how to get through life with my children. I know anyone who has kids and reads this book will get something out of it to help them through the good times and bad times. I hope the writer comes out with another book soon."
2,Outdated Methodology,"""Which do you want: the green or the red?"" Neither. The approaches in this book are transparently manipulative. Marketing has evolved to give prospects more information, more control, more respect. Has selling not?"
3,A bit Wordy,"The book has some good information, but it was a bit wordy. I wish a good editor had gone through the book and taken out about 50 pages. There were explanations where no explanations were needed and topics that were beyond the scope of the book, such as time management.Also, some of the closing techniques would annoy the hell out of me if I were a customer. Overall, I'd say the book was okay."
5,"simple,concise & practical","it was wonderful that i have read this book! despite the initial impression that most sales books are difficult to reach the goals that we set, this book teaches us to do it step by step, so we can achieve little successes in our lives - to reach big successes"
4,Use as a supplement to other sources,"I recently got my first sales job this past fall and had no idea how to sell something. I'm pretty sure I got the job because of my charisma and gift of the gab. Anyway, I picked up this book and found that it really gave me a strong foundation for selling by first giving me the basics and then helping me hone my skills. I definitely recommend this book for beginners...or dummies! : )By the way, feel like I should plug http://www.SellingCrossing.com because that was where I found my job. It was great because it has jobs only from employer websites and far more jobs than you will find on other job boards. Thanks a lot!"
4,Selling For Dummies,"My co-workers made sport of me when I was listening to the cd between customers, Until my sales started picking up again. It is a great reminder of the things we already know, but put back in our minds. I have the book also. Thanks Tom for another great product!"
3,Wasn't all that I hoped for,"I agree with the poster that said the author plugged his other works. That surprised me, though I don't know why since it is a book about making sales. More techniques and discussion of issues like shyness should have been included."
2,May not be for you,"I sell in retail, and this audio book just didn't do what I hoped it would. Didn't hear much on closing, approaching customers, and the like. Brian Tracy and Zig Ziglar do a better job, i think.I also like listening to the author. Usually because its from a recorded seminar, and also, for me, it just makes sense. The speaker was very boring and sounded plain. Sounds like he's reading a book, not having a conversation, which helps me get interested.I think some people starting out will find it some what informative, but I think they could have done, much better in my eyes."
5,GREAT CASE!!,"These are some great pistol cases. This is the second one that I have purchased. They have great padding, very durable and is very roomie."
3,OK case,It seems well made but I had to modify the foam inside because it was not holding the gun securely in place. If you have a heavy gun I recommend a higher priced case or modify it like I did. Works fine with lighter hand guns like the polymer ones.
4,ok gun case,a little big for what i needed. but it works.. fits my glock 19 +3 clips and 50 rounds. needed to wear down lock area so lock would fit too
4,Works fine,It is currently in use and I've no complaints. It is what it is and that's a low cost but effective case to carry and store handguns. Nothing fancy but then again I didn't pay for anything fancy.
4,Great book,"The book was in NEW condition even though the seller's review stated that it was fair. The only thing that was different was the cover of the book. The book I received was a different color and no photo like the website shows. Other than that, it is NEW and in great condition!"
5,Great little emblem.,Two and a half years on the back of my car and going strong. Hasn't come unstuck or faded or anything and I'm not the best about washing the car. It's made it through two cross-country moves so far and all kinds of crazy weather and is holding up well. I recommend it!
2,Takes to Long!!!!,Ordered this book for summer school and its still hasn't showed up and I'm going into my third week of school. This wouldn't be a problem in the regular semester but there's only six weeks in the summer session. If you plan on ordering make sure to do it at least two weeks before school starts or you'll be behind waiting for a book never seems to be coming.
2,"It's OK, not great","I would recommend this set only because good Japanese learning tools for young children are so hard to find. The adult singers are not native speakers; if you buy this, tell your little listeners to concentrate on the way the native children singers pronounce words. The English 'translations' are merely the usual English lyrics; many words have been altered in the Japanese to fit the rhyme and rhythm. For example, the last line of 'Mary Had a Little Lamb' should be translated as ""isn't it cute?"" not ""the lamb was sure to go."""
3,This tape is designed for preschool - 1st grade only.,"The songs are for preschool age children which my 5 year old daughter enjoyed, but the songbook does not have the English translation on the same page which makes it difficult to follow. My older children were not interested in this tape at all."
3,English children's songs with Japanese lyrics,"I bought this title for my small daughter who was at one time fascinated with all things Japanese. Most of the music are familiar English children's songs with Japanese lyrics. The accompanying booklet provides the Japanese lyrics and the English translation. My daughter enjoyed it greatly, although I had hoped for more traditional Japanese children's songs (and, hence, a more cultural experience). Nevertheless, it does somewhat live up to the title of ""Teach Me Japanese"" because my daughter did pick up some Japanese words from the lyrics; and she did learn to read and write a few Japanese characters from one catchy tune."
3,Could be more detailed,"The book is a good read, but could have more technical details about the development of Lockheed's aircraft. It's worth reading, surely."
3,Mariah Keeps Cool Review,Mariah is planning a party for her sister Lynn. Lynn keeps on telling her that she doesn't want a party. Mariah doesn't care!Mariah's half sister Denise comes to live with them. Denise would not follow any of the rules and would disrupt the family.Mariah' family is starting to fall apart. Mariah joins a team called the Fantastic Five. That is a swim team. She loves to swim and is pretty good at it.I reccomend this book to mainly girls. Some how she manages to get her family back together.
1,Not my type,"The book Mariah Keeps Cool is about a girl named Mariah, she has a sister named Lynn and is about to get another sister named Denise there half sister at first she likes her but then it turns out they hate each other. Denise is 16. Mariah is on a swim team. The coach is very hard headed. I think this book is the worst book I have ever read in my whole life. The swim team is named Friendly 5. Mariahs favorite star is sheik. BY LINDSEY K."
4,Way We Get By Review,This is a Super EP and an excellent addition to your Spoon Collection. The version of Metal Detector and I Am the Key are worth buying this ep for. These songs are well crafted and eclectic.
3,Stunning,"This purchase met all of my expectations. I especially love the photography. The portraits are absolutely beautiful and truly graceful. The quotes were refreshing. I would recommend this book to ages, young adults to the more seasoned.Elfrida,"
5,Good Movie Is Good O.o,"If you saw Death Note Live Action Movies 1 & 2 and you loved the actors and you loved the story and you worshipped at Kennichi~sama's feet, then you will LOVE this movie. NO ONE plays a better L than Kennichi~sama. Not even Kappei Yamaguchi~sama (L anime voice actor). If you love L, then this is just a good movie. It's perfectly in character for him, even if it has so very little to do with the Death Note. It's a good good movie. I cried my eyes out, I smiled constantly. It's just GREAT. I'm sorry, this probably isn't a fair review, but it's just soooooooo great, I can't find the words to describe it, and I couldn't think of one single thing bad to say about this movie."
2,So bad he's good?,"An acquired taste. Probably works better live in a gin mill when you're half snockered, and best when you're completely snockered."
2,Way over priced!!,This product is way over priced and isn't even the new version of the trigger. The new one is only 80$ and this is 25$ more for a worse product.
4,An excellent text for motivated students in small group.,"I used this book for a 200-level community college class. The majority of the students (who hung in there for all 3 quarters...) already had a rather good grasp of basic grammar. The book has EXCELLENT stories; the exercises are thorough and practical; the essay assignments were very enjoyable/challenging; it takes the student through the subjunctive tense very well. I am state-certified as a Spanish interpreter, and I continue to refer to this book for help with some finer points of grammar or as a ""refresher"" text. I enjoyed having the entire text (exercise instructions included) in Spanish, but many of the students were frustrated by this factor. It's a great book for a (serious) small-group class with a GOOD Spanish speaker to help refine the skills you'll be developing through the exercises/essays."
1,"Flimsy thin stretch fabric, not denim","I needed a thick, durable fabric to protect a chair from our 90lb dog and thought denim would be the perfect solution, unfortunately this is nowhere close to denim, it is a very thin jersey knit stretch fabric in a poor imitation denim color. There is no indication of the actual fabric on the page. Will be returning."
4,Diss it or hit it,"Blinx is a very exciting game to play. In the beginning, it was very confusing but shortly I learned how to play. This game is very challenging, colorful, and long. But I have to admit I really enjoy playing this game. The graphics are awesome. Just marveously awesome."
3,Console games have come a long way.,"I wanted to buy Blinx just because of what I've seen and heard in reviews. The game is fun but a little tough at times and it does get a bit frustrating. I haven't been playing it as much as I thought I would. Honestly, either rent it from the video store or buy it on ebay.. don't pay full price for this game."
2,I don't get the hype...,I just don't get the hype about this game. It's cartoonish but WAY too hard and frustrating for kids. It doesn't seem to have a point and the replay value is non-existent. The graphics are good since it's an XBox game but that is about all I can say about it and the only reason it earned two stars. The music in the game will make you go ballistic in about ten minutes. A Mario-Wannabe that doesn't make the grade. Rent it first.
1,Mario is better than Blinx! Gamecube is better than Xbox!,"I hate this game! This is the worst platformer ever. Super Mario Sunshine is way better. Xbox sucks!!!! 4-D. Yeah right. It just copied Super Mario Sunshine. Have you noticed that the thing that dorky cat carries is kind of a combo between Luigi's vacuum, and Mario's FLUDD. Who wants a lame time controlling thing! FLUDD is way cooler. Sorry Xbox geeks, but Blinx is just not worth your money."
3,"Nice at first, but turns bad on u wit frustration","Me and my homes were playin dis game, and at first, it seemed why this game was perhaps the Xbox E3 game of the year, but my homes shouda listend to gamespot, but he didn't and the game got frustrating down da road, and we were lookin up stratagy guides to find an easier way to go on on this part, but we had to look up reel good, and it took us a while to beat this game. Frustrating, but fun going through the levels, cuz my friend basicly did all the work. So I recomend this game to people looking 4 a frustratin challange that'll make em' slam their controller, others, maybe a rent.Peace"
2,Great graphics & concept ! Bad control and gameplay.,"When I first heard about this game I was thrilled, another great platformer with some edge. Then after seeing the graphics I bought the game but to my surprise the gameplay control was messed up, when you run in a room you can easily fire at a target because of the auto aim feature that weirdly enough you can't turn off. Great ! but the problem is when their is more than two targets in a area the auto aim gets crazy and when you try to fire at one enemy the auto aim locks onto another. Thus creating waste of ammo and bad camera angles: resulting in overall totally bad gameplay."
1,Frustration...,Our household has 3 people and 2 XBoxes and we go through a large number of games in many genres. We were all in agreement quite fast that this game is too much. The music and visuals are great but the FRUSTRATION factor heavily outweighs the enjoyment. There is simply too much going on at the same time and it detracts from your enjoyment of the game.
3,hmmmmm...,"The concept is good and the controls are solid. The novelty of time control tends to wear out a bit quickly and it is a bit too ""Mario-ish"" for my tastes. I was hoping for more of a puzzler like Oddworld, but the game is amusing to an extent. I would say that this game would be more in line for a younger crowd."
1,"High hopes, low resolts...","As promising as this title was in pictures, and little movies as well as concept, the end result is a frustrating adventure that you won't want to finish. This game is not as easy as the cute cat might make you feel. The puzzles and the strategy involved with the time vacuum, make Luigy very scared. The problem is that with all these difficult puzzles, some of the difficulty stems from all the back trailing. You will have to constantly go back to previously visited places to obtain new items. This gets old very fast and brings the game down. The time travel concept is a great concept, with sub par delivery. I agree with IGN in stating that this looks more like a tech demo for the HD than a game. Playing this game reminds me of over rated games like GUNVALKERY, Wreckless, Raw and Blood wake. A lot of hype but little delivery.At leat Nintendo won't be the only once with a game that involves a vacuum and a lot of sucking."
3,Blinx Not At His Best!,I got this game as a present and find it VERY hard. If you have played other XBOX games you might think it's easy. This was my first XBOX game and I found it VERY VERY annoying to have to start OVER and OVE and OVER. IF this is your first time on XBOX I think you should try a different XBOX game.
3,"Nice at first, but turns bad on u wit frustration","Me and my homes were playin dis game, and at first, it seemed why this game was perhaps the Xbox E3 game of the year, but my homes shouda listend to gamespot, but he didn't and the game got frustrating down da road, basicly on controls, and and time sweepin, and the story is rather dull, and we were lookin up stratagy guides to find an easier way to go on on this part, but we had to look up reel good, and it took us a while to beat this game. Frustrating, but fun going through the levels, cuz my friend basicly did all the work. So I recomend this game to people looking 4 a frustratin challange that'll make em' slam their controller, others, maybe a rent.Peace"
1,Rent it first!,"What can I say? I've looked forward to this platformer since the first I read of it. Thank God, I rented it first...personally, I can think of one word to describe this game; annoying! The color scheme, the voice characterization, the game play (felt like I was back in 6th grade...being graded on level performance? I'd have preferred, and at least laughed, at a sarcastic critique), the cluttered interface due to the vcr buttons, were all annoying. I was actually beginning to root for the monsters to kill me.This is all too bad, because the concept of utilizing Xbox's hardrive to facilitate some rather unique game play was one of the key points of this console.In fairness to the game developers, I'll assume the game improves as it moves along, however, if the first few levels are, again, annoying, then perhaps many gamers won't bother to venture further."
3,I haven't Tried The Game to See If It works.,"It seems good but, I haven't played the game so, I don't know if it works. Thanks for the game. I hope It works. I have seen some one play this game and it didn't seem bad. It looked Fun."
4,This game is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is the ultimate game. It's a bit hard, and the controlls take a while to get used to, but this game is the best. The TS-X7 is the best weapon in the game."
1,not worth it at all,"The videos for this game made it look amazing. But you have to play the game to see how horid it is. The game seems like a game for little kids but it is not,its way too hard. It is extremely agrivating and is just boaring doing the same thing over and over again. It has bad gameplay too. All you do is walk around and shoot trash at stupid globs that look exactly like eachother. The bosses are big globs too but bigger. If you want a platform game get Crash. This game should have been awsome, Blinx could be an awesome mascot but the game stinks. XBOX needs more platformers, atleast sonic heroes is coming out."
4,"Awesome, most fun gaming",Got this for my kids but I've played it too. It is very fun. I rate it a solid 4-star game. We love it.
4,"Dirty in a good way, and Definitely Down","Quentin Tarantino wants to slap Spike Lee. Miramax co-chair Harvey Weinstein shafted Ben Affleck and Matt Damon out of money they deserved from ""Good Will Hunting."" Robert Redford's Sundance Film Festival has done as much to hurt independent film as help it.These juicy, startling revelations are just the beginning of what Biskind has to offer in his 14 years of dish, analysis and interviews.Best known for writing the seminal study of the 1970s Hollywood golden era, ""Easy Riders, Raging Bulls,"" Biskind takes the reader into the backroom deals, tense meetings and creative energy that propped up the indie renaissance of the 1990s. The book is dense yet quick paced, witty and endlessly amusing, and a must-read for any cinephile."
3,"An interesting, objective and informative opinion.","Although I really loved Peter's narrative, I couldn't help thinking how well does he really know the people he is describing. I loved his story telling of the indepentent movie arena in the 90's but quite frankly his portrayal of the Weinsteins, I found off the mark. A much more honest appreciation of the moguls can be found in Looking For Harvey Weinstein. The funniest and most positive book I've read this year."
1,HO HUM,"If you are not in the business of making movies this long exposition on the politics of the industry is a total dud.Who cares ( outside of the industry ) about the machinations of deal making, money raising, back slapping and back stabbing in the indie film world. In fact, I have close friends and relatives ( in the film making business ) who were also bored to tears. Thumbs down."
1,"File under BUSINESS, not MOVIES","Do you love movies, or do you love backroom business gossip about the movie industry? If it's the former, skip this book.Movies could just as easily be widgets in this repetitive, uninteresting chronicle of Mirimax and Sundance. They are secondary to the details of executives and business deals in this yawner.Imagine having seemingly unlimited access to some of the greatest film makers of the 90's, and all you can come up with is what hardnoses the Weinsteins are. Don't stop the presses."
2,**,"This book had a hard act to follow from the author's previous book, so it suffers from that. I'm not someone who sees every movie released, so I didn't see a lot of films mentioned in this book. My main interest was in the Robert Redford section, and the reputed dirt on him wasn't so bad. He's passive aggressive, and took advantage of his position to gain control of material, and didn't return calls and is chronically late. Not gossipy enough for my taste! The overrated Tarentino's delusions of grandeur were interesting to read about. But, just as a fan of the film, I was disappointed no mention of the film SPUN was included. SPUN is about as indie as you can get, and was the best indie film of the past five years."
5,You won't put it down,This book is packed full of information in a very readable form.Don't take it to bed. You won't get any sleep. Great information on the immune system and how Echinacea works WITH the body for healing. No! I won't lend this book out to anyone. It's too valuable.
5,A cool read,"We had to read ""fiction"" about an African American artist for the Black History Month assignment, but they would not let us do Rap. I got this from the assignment sheet and I did not want to but had to because I had been out sick the day of the first picks. The teacher said it was about Miles Davis, even though the wrighter calls the dude Merlin Black. I had never heard of either one, but a friend of mines stepfather says he knows who he was sure. He playde jazz, which is slow, I thought.And man this is a real surprise. This is the kind of dude I want to be, because he is a bad mother in many ways but really good. He held off some pretty bad racists and always did his own jobs. He was not nice to his women but there were a lot of them and he always felt sorry. I got my friend to get some cds of this Miles from his stepfather and I really liked some of his music eventhough some of it really is slow.Also the book is short. I didn't want to read a long one."
1,Not The Best Buy,"Although the product description at this point is not existant at this point the ""Collecter's Edition"" doesn't usually account for the lack of new areas and features. I'm not buying it!!"
4,AWESOME demo,"The reason I gave it 4 stars is cause I don't like to give 5 stars away to easily and I haven't played the full version yet. This game puts you in the star trek universe, not only do you fight aliens as an away team member, you also get to have side missions such as stop a warp core breach (all included in the demo). in the full version looks like you get to have some fun in the holodeck and the weapons look cool. in the demo the multiplay was a bit lacking, but it was just a demo, and people posted so many reviews on the message board of ravensofts that they could do better with multiplay that I think they'll have it fixed. all in all I can't wait to have this game. P.S. psst.... don't tell anyone but amazon is selling the collectors edition ... cheaper then ebworld. *wink wink* :-)"
4,Thisgame is refreshing and fun,"While testing the demo I found myself lost in the StarTrek universe.With all the extras that come with the Collecters edition I think it will be well worth the extra $.While the single person game is liniar, at least it has one(unlike Quake3). This is the first game I have found that does justice to the series.Where else can you tour a Borg cube then Walk around a Federation Star Ship?"
4,A thinker's sf,"The author of this book, Jeff Sutton, co-authored one of my favorite childhood books, ""The Beyond"", which in a powerful fashion, detailed the life of a child telepath living in a society which criminalized paranormal abilities.This book, ""Whisper From the Stars"", echoes the above story, in that a so-called ""evolutionary advancement"" in mankind (in this case, using the mind to transcend the physical body thereby changing time and altering historical events) is opposed by governmental powers to close this door to ordinary people who really are not ready for this type of transformation.The point of view is not from one of the supermen, but from a reporter who can remember events even after the timestream has been altered, a frustrating gift. There is much speculation here concerning the nature of man and what form any advancement would take; in other words, if you like action more than complicated philosophy, don't read this book."
4,A wonderful first course for enthousiasts,"The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I am not a great fan of Conway's style, and have wasted too much time on mangled examples in his Complex Analysis.That said, the layout here is superb, and the choice of topics just what is needed to get one of the ground. Beginners will find it useful to have a copy of Kreyszig at hand."
5,lovely,"I'm learning functional analysis from this book and it's absolutely wonderful. Clear, comprehensive, starts essentially from scratch (it assumes measure theory and linear algebra but nothing else) and deals in detail with what I think is a beautiful subject, the spectral theory of linear operators."
3,deodorant??,Smells ok. Kinda old ladyish but its ok. I can't beat the price. One question though. Why is it called deodorant spray???? Weird. It's in a regular cologne bottle. I thought it was the type of powder body that is a deodorant too and comes in a can- type container.
3,good but not great,"I was just a little bit dissapointed with this CD. The main reason is because, since it is on the FANIA label, I expected it to be a bit more danceable and a bit less jazzy. The music is good, but not really what I expected."
4,Nice,"I purchased this necklace for my daughters 11th birthday. It was nicer than what I thought for $45. It is a smaller circle than you typically see at the jewelry stores, which was nice for me because it is for a pre-teen. I had also purchased the one with blue topaz and diamonds from amazon and liked this one better. The blue is a pretty color where on the other necklace it was washed out."
5,lovely quality,"The quality of the stones is very nice- better than the photo. They have a true sky-blue color, nice clarity, and lots of sparkle.It is a petite pendant...about the size of a dime... but the stones themselves are still a good size and give it a nice presence. This is to be a gift, but I'm sorely tempted to keep it for myself!"
5,A Retro-Classic,"Whats up screwed and chopped fans, this is the one, that'll take you way back, the chops are great, its worth the money"
2,"Loved it, but it doesn't last!","This thing is really awesome - for a week. It didn't anytime at all before the stress of pulling back the air cannon deal caused it to break the ring that holds it on. Also, it was an absolute nightmare to assemble, it did not want to stay together at all.Overall, if it was more durable, I would love it. But it was a total waste!"
2,Neat but Flimsy!,"I bought this after seeing a family member use one and though it looked really neat. It was quite the toy to have around for a week, then it broke on the front, leaving it useless. I'd be willing to pay a bit more if they would make it stand up to more than a weeks worth of use."
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"I was told by others that have bought this product that it ""Shoots a very powerful stream of air."" That is stretching it. I purchased the Airzooka to discourage squirrels from my bird feeders. Unfortunately, they barely even feel the ""breeze"" this product creates. It actually makes more noise than anything else when you pull back the diaphram to fire it.Kids might find it mildly amusing for 10-15 minutes before it is set aside and destined for the next garage sale."
2,Airzooka hard to aim,"The AirZooka is a fun toy, but pretty much for adults and older kids. I got it for my 6 year old who thought it looked awesome. Unfortunately I don't think he's ever hit anything more than a foot away with it. The adults after practice can usually hit something after 6 or 7 tries, but the ad saying you can surprise someone with a blast of air is not accurate. It makes a lot of noise since its a thick plastic piece getting slapped by a rubber band. Its fun, but not the easiest thing in the world to use."
2,Poor performance and not much fun,"This toy isn't nearly as fun as it should be. It was a pain to put together, with pieces that didn't line up easily and required more effort to snap together than I expected -- and once it was assembled it just didn't work that well.The ball of air only goes 10 feet, not the ""up to 20 feet"" it says on the box; on top of being the size of a small trashcan, firing it makes a loud noise, ruining your chances of stealthily blasting anyone; and the sight is useless -- you have to aim through the barrel, and even then you need to be so close that aiming is pointless.Technically, the airzooka does what it says it does -- sort of, and not well. I threw mine out a couple of days after it arrived."
1,POOR,"I could not get this thing to work. It took a herculean effort to get it emit any air flow at all. Very disappointed. Assembly wasn't hard even with the terrible directions, but all in all, this thing has CHEAP written all over it. I had ordered a total of 4. Hoping I could assemble each one and give one as a goofy hostess gifts when visiting [fun] friends == sent them all back and donated the one that I assembled to a gag grab-bag"
2,Pffft...,I ordered hoping this Air Gun would be effective in blowing webs and tiny insects off the lenses of security cameras at a range of ten feet. My device delivered only a mild puff out to maybe eight feet. I thought it would send a ball of air ten feet.This isn't what it was designed to do but I had to try. Putting together took me a long time and lots of sweat and re-reading the instructions. And muscle. The pieces didn't snap together as neatly as I hoped. But finally it was assembled and tested.It takes strong hands and arms to fire a shot. I'm a senior and not easily up to it.
1,Bad Idea,This toy was purchased as a Christmas gift and the reaction from all who waited patiently for the highly anticipated and advertised BIG AIR BOOM was overwhelming disappointment. We could almost blow a tissue off the table with it if we got close enough to it. Very disappointed with my decision to purchase this item.
5,Fun and useful,"I bought this as a deterrent to keep my cat away from my TV (he was trying to scratch it). It only took once of actually aiming the air at him...now when he starts to scratch, I only have to pick up the airzooka and he backs off. Definitely a better way than using a spray bottle or other suggestions I'd heard. It doesn't hurt him, and I don't have to worry about the TV getting scratched.Also, it's a lot of fun, especially for kids to be able to shoot across the room and see curtains/papers being blown away."
4,Lots of fun!,"Item comes unassembled. I had a little bit of trouble getting the handles aligned up with the pre-drilled holes, but finally got it. Other than that, it was a piece of cake! Lots of fun shooting air at each other! I would recommend. Fun way of letting a boy have a sort of ""gun"" type toy without pellets, or foam darts that get lost, etc... I can't see of any way to get injured with this toy at all, it's only air! Was as fun Christmas activity."
1,"Very Flimsy, Poor Quality","Bought this for my 13 yr old. Does not Shoot Air more that 15 ft. The puff of air is weak. The quality is so low, I expect it to last for not much longer than a week."
2,cheap garbage,"Received 2 for xmas, 1 broken out of the box, the other broke within 5 minutes of use. My 6 year old could barely pull the plastic diaphragm back. Cannot recommend these. Fun idea, but they need to be better designed and made more durable."
1,Buyer Beware!,"My son saved up for months for this toy, waited for the mail to arrive for weeks to have the toy break putting it together. You can imagine how he felt. Life lesson I'm afraid but that sure sucks."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS: Cheap Chinese Garbage,"This thing takes cheap Chinese manufacturing to a whole new level. I'd used one in the past that was fantastic, no doubt construction from outside of mainstream, brittle malformed plastic China. The manufacturer has since sacrificed everything that made this thing great, and results are a frustrating, impossible to assemble expensive pile of black Chinese garbage. Don't buy this. Even if you can get it together, there's no doubt in my mind that it won't last for more than a week of mild use."
2,It was fun for the 2 hours before it broke,"Our AirZooka lasted 2 hours. My grandson used it for maybe 30 minutes the first night. The second evening he used for about 90 minutes (not continously by any means)and the launcher broke. Yes, it was only $15 but he was really disappointed - and I can think of alot of things I would do with $15!"
5,hours of entertainment with the airzooka,"We bought two of these for our nephews at Christmas and the adults got as much fun with them as the kids! They shoot far and the air is strong at a distance-sending paper flying, hair flying. It's fairly easy to use, maybe not as much for really young kids as you really need to have some muscle to pull back on it. It can be hard to aim-the 'scope' on top does not really help much."
1,Broken in Less than a Minute,This item broke in one shot. The ropes (bungee type) broke away from the plastic and could not be re-attached.
4,This serves my purpose perfectly.,"I have a 73 inch Widescreen tv and a cat. The cat leaves the tv alone all day. Then, when I come home and start watching the tv, the cat will walk up to the tv, then turn and look at me (like he is taunting me), and then he will reach up, stretch his claws, and attempt to scratch the tv. Of course I have always jumped up and stopped him, but that gets old. This thing was a perfect solution to this problem. When he makes a move, I just shoot a harmless gust of wind at him. It doesn't hurt the cat or the tv, and there is nothing to pick up or reload.It was kind of a pain to put it together. The pieces felt like they were going to break, especially when I was expanding the three sections. Once the screws are in, it is very sturdy.I don't know that it would be ""Fun"" for a kid to play with. I suppose you could use it to scare someone when they walk around a corner. It has a good boom sound and it does shoot a good gust of wind."
5,The office loves it,Good quality and a lot of fun! Easy to assemble and everyone in my office is in love with it.
4,Fun while it lasts,"My 13 year old son had a terrible time trying to assemble this, but now that he's got it together he loves it! It's really fun to play with. Unfortunately the plastic inside (where you pull back the lever) is already 'crackling' after just one day of use so I'm not sure how long this will hold up. It doesn't look like there would be any way to replace it so once that rips or tears you'd have to buy another air gun."
1,DOESNT SHOOT POWERFULLY!,"I got this for my 11 year old brothers birthday. Not only did the set-up take 25 plus min. (when it was only supposed to be two seconds), but after it was set up, the product was disappointing. The air blasted is really not powerful at all. It says you can feel it 20 feet away, but really 20 feet away it would feel like nothing more than a gentle gust of wind. Needless to say, this product is not what it is advertised as. Definately, would spend your $20.00 elsewhere!!!"
3,BORN TO BE SOLD - (UK - PAL FORMAT),"This movie I would classify as more of a 'chick flick' with Lynda Carter giving a wonderful performance as ""Kate Carlin"" who finds herself entangled in/and trying to stop a 'baby for sale' ring, which ends up endangering her own life. The movie has a very nice roster of stars and although I would rate this a B plus, it definitely has it's value in that, it brings this issue forward of an ongoing world-wide problem. The main cast of stars include: Harold Gould, Philip Sterling, Dean Stockwell, Sharon Farrell, Lloyd Haines, Ed Nelson, Joy Garrett, Claire Malis, Donna Wilkes, Rita Taggart, Madeline Paiss, Kathy Beaudine, and Ken Hill.Unfortunately, the picture is barely VHS quality. Closed Captioning is not included.Note: This is not a region free release and will not play on standard DVD or Blu Ray players in the U.S. You will need a region free DVD or Blu Ray player to play this format (or a region free 'portable' DVD player)."
4,Thought provoking antidotes that will amuse and enlighten,"This collection of essays has something for everyone, interested in the sciences. Harold Morowitz's wit and wisdom make hard to understand subjects easy to comprehend. From brownian movement as it relates to the stock market to as the tittle suggests the insulating value of pizza crust this book is a winner."
3,Psuedoscience at best,"Yup, it's entertaining, but I doubt the ""science"" behind the entertainment. Fun thoughts (ramblings?) on various issues, all eventually pertaining to what it means to be ""human"". I finished the first few essays and gave up. Now it sits by my bedstand when I'm in between books and in need of sleep."
5,Best five bucks I've spent in a while!,"This comb is great! My cat is an indoor cat and, fortunately, doesn't have fleas. I just wanted something more effective than a brush in removing loose fur and this does the trick. It picks up much more loose fur, is extremely easy to clean (much easier than a brush), and my cat's coat (short hair) looks absolutely stunning. The added benefit is that he absolutely LOVES being groomed with this comb. Highly recommended, fleas or not!"
4,Would Recommend,This product works great on getting the fleas and eggs caught on the teeth of the comb. Only bad thing I found is on some of his shorter slicker hair (just as on the legs) it doesn't go down to the skin. But other than that I would definately recommend.
5,Kitty loves it,It is just the berries for getting out stubborn flea eggs from the fur and the cat loves the attention and combing.
3,Flea Comb has pins just a little too tight.,Very difficult to comb. It would surely get the critters but the pins shouldn't be so close together. I will have to look for another brand. It was too cheap to consider returning as a deficient product.
3,Its ok,My cat is picky with brushes and didnt like this one at all. By the time I tried to use it to check for the fleas they were mostly gone anyways
3,Fine recipes--but I didn't realize they were low-fat!,"In my ongoing quest for simple recipes to throw in the Crock-Pot, I ordered this book, and am generally pleased with it.The recipes themselves are quite appealing and meet my primary criterion for slow-cooker meals: They call for simple ingredients requiring a minimum of preparation in the morning... The vast majority of them are things I wouldn't hesitate to try.The only real gripe I have is one that perhaps I could have avoided had I looked carefully at the enlarged picture of the front cover and seen that these are LOW-FAT recipes. (In retrospect, I now understand the word ""Smart"" in the title.) Looking at the recipes, I think I can probably remedy that by simply using higher-fat versions of the ingredients (whole or 2% milk instead of skim, full-bore sour cream instead of light, etc.).All in all, probably an OK book to add to your Crockery Cookery collection..."
3,Caution--This is a Low Fat Cookbook,"My major observations after flipping through this cookbook are:1) It is a low-fat cookbook, which is great if that is what you are looking for. 2) Many of the recipes require browning of meat prior to adding it to the crockpot, which is a drawback. 3) This cookbook does not make heavy use of convenience items, like canned soups, which is a plus. (It does call for canned broths, which is not objectionable). Overall, a nice selection of recipes, particularly if you are trying to avoid the crockpot cookbooks which call for opening & dumping processed foods like entire bottles of catalina dressing."
4,Very sweet,This is a darling version of this story with very cute illustrations. My 4-year-old loves it.
4,"Funny book, horribly edited","I enjoyed this book very much. It's full of over-the-top social satire. I'm not normally much of a mystery reader, but this isn't really mainstream mystery novel anyway. I liked it enough that I later bought (and enjoyed) the sequel.Having said that, I should mention that I have *never* read a book as poorly edited as this one. Nearly every page contained typos, grammatical errors, and the like. These tended to distract from the story itself, which is too bad."
4,A really fun read,"I enjoyed this book a lot ... it was indeed pretty weird, but the author spun the web well - and pulled the plot parts together.I can honestly say I was a little disappointed when there was no more book to read ..."
1,it was too cutesy,the book did not appeal to me personally but maybe it was justme... the characters were too in depth and too detailed... the plotlline too long...
5,Interesting characters in a fast paced whodunit.,"This is a real page turner. The characters are very detailed, and you can really care about them. Keith Hartman uses many points of view, and it works wonderfully. I enjoyed this book very much."
1,Fall of the NWA,"This show sums up pretty nicely why the NWA was always going to be second to the WWF. In the Main Event, 2 40-something men (Ric Flair and Rick Steamboat) wrestle for an hour in front of an indifferent crowd, while the younger, more popular wrestlers battle in the undercard. I WOULD however reccomend checking out the match between Lex Luger and Barry Windham in the midcard, but sadly it's the only match of any note on an otherwise insipid card."
5,Great game.,I have played fighting games for a long time and I am still playing this great game. This game is a steal .
2,A step back,"This game is a total disappointment. Gameplay is relatively simple, moves are limited, and the characters don't seem to move right. In addition, the character's skin has a shiny ""Barbie Doll"" surface look to it (just doesn't look right). This game gets boring fast. I don't recommend it unless you can pick it up really cheap."
5,Go Yanks!,I bought this tire cover for my husband because someone stole the last one I bought him. He claims this one is great with a much better fit than the last one.
1,Wound up returning them,Wound up returning them. They got stuck continually. Did not re purchase this item. Don't buy it. Nothing more to say about it.
1,Don't waste your money on this book nor anything by the same author,"I bought two book from the same author and both are total waste of my hard earned money.The checkmate position are so dumb and useless (none are from real game and none will be seen in real game).It doesn't help you to improve your chess at all. I think the author is a shame in the chess world, how can someone put together such a book. Any real chess player could tell this is a useless book after reading just few position in it."
3,Picture good but BUZZES loudly,The buyer should beware if you don't want to hear buzzing all the time from this set.Samsung says there is NO fix for this problem except turning your set to 10 on the backlight. To me this is not what you buy a lcd tv for to make it work out of its parameters. Picture is good and no complaints except my cable company is terrible for the aspect ratio operation.
5,tax refund,This TV's picture is excellent and it met all of my expectations. It is everything that I was looking for.
4,It just about does what it promises,"Bought this TV as my first HD TV, and found it to be easy to set up, remote and setting is intuitive. My grip is with picture quality for non-HD programming, it quiet bad at time, but the resolution is still worse than my non-HD generic 17 inch flat screen TV. Is it possible I did not have the right setup, I hope this is the case. For a promised contrast of 15,000, I regret to inform potential buyers than you can see the pixels on the screen. Price is very reasonale, specially if you don't have to pay sale taxes the saving may be enough to buy a decent DVD player."
5,"Best 40"" 1080p LCD out there","I had second thoughts about this TV, due to some bad reviews out there about the sound quality and HDMI issues, but I have honestly not experienced either issues.I have been researching the 4061 since it first came out, and returned my Sharp Aqous just to get this TV.I ordered through Amazon, which went smoothly, but the problem was with Eagle Shipping. They had lost the 1st set I had purchased, which of course upset me and I almost went with another store. But I decided to give it another shot with Amazon. The 2nd TV came in flawless by Eagle. The guys were very friendly, and even the box was flawless. No bends, no tears, not even a single mark!Unpacked the TV and set it up (you can set this up yourself, as the stand is already pre-mounted). Hooked up the Antennae, Upconvert DVD player, and of course the wii, and everything ran PERFECTLY. NO dead pixels, NO clouding, just a perfect set right out of the box!"
5,Great TV,"We had been looking for a LCD TV and found this model that would fit into our existing space. The price on Amazon was considerably less than local stores. We recieved the item in less than a week in good condition. Was a little skeptical about ordering something of this size and cost on the internet, but we would do it again."
5,Good product! No problems!,This product is exactly as stated. I was worried about the shipping but it was fast and damage free. This TV allows for firmware upgrades via USB which is EXCELLENT! The menu is easy to use and navigate. You cannot go wrong if you buy a Samsung... or a Sharp!
5,"Great Deal, Great Product","Had a great experience ordering from Amazon. Good price, Good shipping and the TV is great"
1,Unreliable - SAVE YOUR MONEY,Great picture - when the aspect ratio is not automatically readjusting.Randomly changes the aspect ratio. Paid way too much for this CRAP.
2,Disapointed,"I Bought this TV set on December 2007 for the firts 3 years worked just perfect, six months ago,I started to have problems when I turned it on, It didnt wanted to start, and it started to take about 5 to 10 minutes before I could see the Image o the screen, after that it always appear a dark Line on the center of the screen. This Morning, on November 16th 2011, the TV just died. its is not the quality I expected for a TV set that cost me at that time Allmost 1000$, I just wont buy another samsung tv."
1,Riddled with problems do not buy!!,After about 2 years of quality tv watching my samsung began to click. It then moved to pink lines on the screen and finally to a black screen with sound only. After researching the problem i found that these are VERY common problems with samsung tvs. Do not buy this tv!!
1,support on older tv is to toss it per their 800 support number,Model LNT4061 worked fine until I downloaded an upgrade to their firmware from their website & now my tv no longer has a correct picture. the picture is with paisley prints and wild wavy colors. Their 800 phone number rep told me that I should not download anything without first speaking to them. No where does the website say call first - but no worries they said tv's older than 5yrs are junk and should be tossed. Can you imagine. BE very carefully buying from them - this tv also has issues with turning on & off 4-6 times before staying on.
2,Nice while it lasted.,"The LCD controller gave out half a year after the extended 3 year warranty did. Samsung wanted $1000 bucks fix it sooo... no thanks. Great TV while it lasted, terrible build quality."
1,It was good while it lasted,"I had the TV for 3 years, I did enjoy it. But it stopped working today. Why can't TV's work longer then 3 years? Such a waste of labor and material."
3,TV is good for about 3 years,"I loved my TV. Picture was great. However, I've had the TV for 3 years now and it recently started to have purple spots all over the screen. For what I paid for it, I was hoping it would last longer than 3 years."
1,Would be nice if Eagle would just get it here!!!!,"Eagle has got to be one of the dumbest delivery companies around. I purchased this set on Feb. 23rd. As of March 3rd. it has made it's way from Reno, NV to Sacramento ,Ca. A grand total of 132 miles EAST. I live 204 miles SOUTH of Reno!!! HELLO Eagle. Look at a map! From Sacramento it is headed south to Los Angeles. THEN back north to Bishop,Ca. It will have traveled 800 miles before it gets here. It would have been cheaper, and taken less time, to just have one of the employees throw it in the back of a pickup truck and drive it down here.Eagle gets a BIG ""F"" for delivery. This will be the LAST item I purchase from Amazon that requires a truck to deliver."
1,No Returnable,"I received Samsung LNT4061F 40-inch 1080p LCD HDTV Apir. 12th, but it was broken. Seller does want it to return or replace"
2,"Good Pictures, Poor Sound.","Everything is good, except for the speakers. Maybe there's something wrong with this unit. I hope Amazon will let me exchange it."
1,tryjac,"I wish i could rate my 40 in TV, but its hard to see the picture on the air compressor that showed up instead. By the way that was on Dec 12 and it's Jan 2 and still no TV."
1,TV overshadowed by shipper's damage to my home,"After reading many reviews of various tv's (and owning a smaller Samsung LCD TV) I decided to purchase this set from Amazon because of the amazing price and ""White Glove Delivery Service"". Unfortunately, I have been unable to watch the tv yet because I am dealing with hundreds of dollars worth of damage that was done to my 2-week old carpet during the delivery. BE WARNED: Amazon sub-contracts delivery for large items and then takes no ownership when their chosen company gets grease all over a customer's new floors. I guess this price really was too good to be true."
4,Nice LCD,"I ordered this LCD TV back in late May and received it 2 weeks later. It took a while because it was shipped by Freight. It arrived in good condition and was very simple to setup. Picture is bright and it worked well out of the box. I've read complaints about the sound but I found the sound very acceptable. For the price, you really can't beat it."
1,After Two Years Black Death,"I purchased my Samsung 40"" LCD LNT- 4061F in June 2007 for $[...]. Last week I started experiencing issues with the TV recycling itself, turning on and off repeatedly. Now all I see are vertical white lines, ""that is when the TV actually stays on!"". I called tech support and I was walked thru all the steps necessary to recycle the TV to fix the problem, no such luck! I I did a little Goggling only to discover many other Samsung owners with the exact same issue. So I called Samsung again explaining that this problem seems to be wide spread and if they were aware of the problem and possibly willing to work with those effected. The answer was no and no. So here I wait for the service company to call me back to schedule my [...] buck look-see. This will be my last Samsung purchase EVER!!!"
3,Sound Problems,"I have owned this set for about a year now. The picture is great, but the speakers sound like they are cracked at certain frequencies. Especially with old movies or TV programs. Quite annoying."
1,weak powersupply,packard bell when they was makin 486's and pentiums used to cut corners using 50watt powersupplys samsung is taking the same cornor cuts and for there faulty cause for recall manufactoring they will just charge you to get it fixed
4,Samsung HDTV,"Great TV except for what appears to be a ""watermark"" image engrained in the lower right hand corner of the screen. It is not always noticeable, but appearred fairly soon after purchasing the TV and is somewhat distracting at times. Also. one of the threaded inserts used to mount the wall bracket stripped out. However, all in all, the unit is mounted about the fireplace and really tidied up our family room and provide a place for another chair in the arear where we used to put our at floor level."
3,Died after 6 months,"6 months of good use, then the unit's picture disapeared, but still had sound. Customer service has been great, but still we have been without a tv for 3-1/2 weeks now awaiting our refund. Also beware of the PIP advertisement, as the full details are not disclosed on most websites."
4,"After much research, I picked this TV","I researched LCD TVs for about a month, not only online but going to several stores to talk to the salesmen. I was leaning toward a Sharp Aquos, by comparing the stats. But after talking and reading A LOT, I settled on a Samsung. Also, most TV salesmen said after looking at TV's all day long, they would buy a Samsung.I was very pleasantly surprised when I realized that Amazon was in line with the lowest prices available. I have dealt with them many times and knew I could trust them. I would have bought a Sony, if money were no object. But my husband and I are very pleased with this purchase."
3,Top Secret The FBI Files On Elvis Presley,I just finished this book and it was ok. A lot of the documents in the back of the book were blacked out but the Author did give some detail as to what they contained. It doesn't take a lot of time to read it some what interesting and different.Anne
2,Pointless,"This is all a bit pointless. The FBI kept files on all public figures during the 50s 60s and 70s (and perhaps beyond) so it wasn't like Elvis was up to anything excitingly illegal as to arouse their suspicion. It's not in story form as to make it easier to follow so this is really for Elvis completists.A lot of the good stuff is blanked out so really, what's the point?"
2,Red Faction,"Red Faction is a futuristic first person shooter set in mars. You play parker a miner in mars who fight against his employers. The game loads data and runs great, The graphics and sound are ok but the geo-mod technology is not as good as they said. The single player is very disappointing. It is a fairly long game but the gameplay is dull because of the poor level design, dumb ai and nothing new. It is not very hard but the designers don't know where the player would run out of ammo or health. Red Faction is very disappointing."
3,"Awesome Engine, Lacking Gameplay","This game has, by far, one of the best engines in a first person shooter I have ever seen. Many of the abilities and effects are simply increadable. The only problem I have with the game is that they never use the powerful ability to blow through walls at any point in the campaign. At no point does an enemy (intentionaly) blow through a wall nor is it ever necissarry for you to get into the awesome drilling tank and tunnel to a new area. I (by happenstance) found a half dozen or so secrets this way, but it was never crucial to the plot. Also, the last boss was a little easy for my tastes, and you have to play a combination guessing game with a timelimit after killing the final boss, which is rather... worthless."
1,1 star wanting to be a 4 or 5 star,I bought this game because others gave it good reviews. I installed it on a HP 510 with XP but can get no further in the game than the menu page. The computer crashes.
2,Red Wha????,"Tierd graphics, boring plot and recycled story line. This aims high and sinks low. The game just blows."
2,almost 3 stars,"I ran this game on a PC that exceeded all recomendations and I still had to run the game on the lowest resolution to avoid lag. I even downloaded new drivers for my video card just for this game and it didn't help. The game does fine until you fight an opponent with an automatic weapon and then the frames per second (FPS) drops down to below one.The idea of being able to blow holes in walls and things is a great idea and is the best part of the game, but the execution of that idea leaves you wanting. The engine seems buggy and unstable.The single player missions force you to give up all your weapons to go undercover, and it leaves you frustrated rather than excited. I haven't played the multiplayer due to a slow internet connection, but with all the lag in single player I can't imagine that it would be worth my time.In the end, I wanted to like this game, but just couldn't seem to do it. It had some good ideas, but ultimately failed to deliver. Better luck next time THQ."
4,A good fps,"This game turned out better than I thought it would. A real fun straight forward shooter. The story was easy to follow even though your objectives, once given, couldn't be seen again. The sound and music was great. The GeoMod engine, in my opinion, didn't add that much to the game.On my almost antiquated computer (450mhz,geforce2,penII,256mb ram), I had no trouble with the game at all. It looked great.Highly recommended for the FPS fan"
3,Same old shooter with better blow-ups and graphics,"The graphics are great, the damage effects are wonderful but it is still the same old 3D shooter in a fancy new bag. What do I mean? Well, you have the ""switch hunting"" type plot. I hate switch hunting. If the game allows you to blow up anything (and Red Faction does not) then finding keys or switches should be irrelevent.The game is fun but it would be much better if it refrained from the ""great key/switch hunt"""
4,Good FPS but.......,"The graphics on this game is pretty good. I was disappointed to find out how short the game was. I have read some of the other posts about needing a objectives screen, but the game isn't that complicated to need one IMHO... I was also annoyed by the game only giving you the only 2 choices of starting completely over or exiting a game when you die if you haven't quicksaved. Sometimes I found myself backtracking very far just to get healed. Also, I would have liked more opportunities to use the heavy artillery weapons more and it is very hard to pick people off from a distance with the sniper rifle because you always get noticed and they move out of the way."
4,Red Faction,"I played the 127mb demo of Red Faction. The system requierments are so low that it unbelivable. The graphics and sound are very good, The GEO-MOD is a great technology, You can blow up everything. But the game is like a half-life clone with a very bad AI. I hope they will tweak the AI in the Full game"
5,SWEET!,"I've been playing FPS since the days of Doom and Wolfenstein, and, I still enjoy those two games. That's beside the point. My latest kicks have been Counterstrike and Unreal Tournament. And, I must say, the Red Faction demo blows the ... out of all of them. The possibilities are endless! Think of the fun if Counterstrike allowed you to burrow across the map! I just hope Volition has made the modding as simple (relatively) as UT. And, IMHO, it was time for the game that redefines the FPS genre to have an epic storyline. The last commercial FPS that really took off (as far as I know, anyway) with some semblance of a storyline was Half-Life, and that played out like a typical sci-fi horror flick. Red Faction has to be the coolest looking game to come out in a long time. If I had ... bucks right now, I'd definitely pre-order this. But I guess I'll just have to wait. Oh well."
2,You need more then an engine to make a good game.,"I bought this game because of the Geo-Mod technology, when I started playing I thought it was a really cool feature, but that's really the only interesting thing about this game. It's as though the designers spent so long working on the Geo-Mod that they left level design up to the last moment, and boy does it show. levels are built like tubes. You go in one end and exit the other. This totally kills the point of geo-mod, what's the point of blowing holes in the walls if theirs only one way through the level? Furthermore the rooms contained on the level are almost all the same, even if your not going to bother with plot (and they haven't) its nice to have some tactics involved. Weather it's sneaking up on enemies or going from cover to cover, I need something more then a flashy engine to keep me interested. This game will likely be the first of many, and hopefully those that follow will make better use of geo-mod."
2,armada,"don't waste your money on this save it for the boxset that's coming out later this year,season1 was horrible,season2 was better,the end of the series was awsome!!!! then they moved on to energon which isn't half bad.....(so far)armada had 5 annoying kids that talked all the time and the transformers just stood there while they were being attacked,in fact thee first two episodes of armada focus on one fight between megatron and optimus which doesn't go anywhere for a whole episode....stick with gen1 and beastwars...."
1,transformers?,worst transformers show ever!WORST CARTOON EVER!WHY THIS AND NOT THAT TRANSTECHSHOW?this dvd is only for 0-6 years old!i warning you!i am a big transformers-cartoon fanthis is juist terrible!please take my word for it!it gets NO STARS!!!!
5,shimmering,"The second full length from Arcanta, ""The Sacred and the Profane,"" shimmers with a warm, magnificent, and powerful light. This recording is simply beautiful--but one must listen to it to fully understand. The voice of Thomas-Carlyle Ayres is not only Arcanta's blood line, but once heard, truely inescapable. The songs, like Arcanta's previous releases, are timeless and reflective, but this time around they more joyous--a celebration, if you will. Just listen, the music will take you over. Feel the warm loving hand touch your face when listening to ""No Hope, No Fear,"" or close your eyes while listening to ""The light of Setting Suns"" and see the most breathtaking imgaes of the falling day imagined. Beautiful. Heavenly. Earthly. Erotic. Spiritual. Soothing. Timeless."
2,Hard to apply.,The company would not let me send it back but was quick to send me another one assuming the first was faulty. I respect them for that. The second one was still hard to apply so I quess what I needed it for (top eyelid eye liner) was not what it is used for OR I just don't know how to apply it. I usually use dark brown and it goes on smoothly and this white eyeliner either globbed up or was too transparent. I did see a lady with a nice smooth thin line and it looked very nice. I guess I will have to ask her where she purchased hers next time I see her. White eyeliner is very hard to find.
3,Seller should show examples of actual colors,"I received this item in one day! Great! However, It didn't come in the same tube as shown in the picture. The color I ordered is BLUE. It wasn't the blue I was expecting. It's more of a light, sparkling green. It's very pretty but it's not what I wanted. For the amount of money I spent, I would have liked to seen the actual colors so I could have made a better choice."
4,Missed the mark with the NIN comparison,"I know I'm dating myself here, but I think a better comparison would be to Killing Joke [from the 80's]. EC has some of the same edgy, dark, but catchy sounds as KJ [for instance, listen to ""Eighties"", ""Love Like Blood"", ""Adorations""] While KJ was definitely classified as a punk band, and EC is not quite as hard as that, listening to this CD takes me back to a time when ""moshing"" was known as ""slam dancing""."
4,Great album,"I took a chance buying this album after hearing the song ""All That You Are"" on the radio and was pleasantly surprised. Econoline Crush have a very powerful, driving sound that I haven't heard in any other band's music. I especially like the vocals that come across as eerie and disjointed yet melodic at the same time. There are a number of great songs on the album, my favorites being ""Home"", ""Sparkle and Shine"", and ""All That You Are"". Pick this album up if you like either hard or alternative rock and hear for yourself."
5,no words to describe it,"what a great cd. its so powerful. great lyrics, ripping guitars. the whole thing sounds like a train just blowing me away. surefire is a great song but some other great ones are devil you know, hollowman, and deep. if you like industrial with a more upbeat tempo then get this cd. thats all"
5,Consumed by the Crush,"I knew, I KNEW, when I first heard Trevor Hurst's voice, that I had to hear more from this guy. His voice had such a clarity about it that I really listened to what he was saying. He sings his emotions with words, and just the right amount of VOICE CONTROL! The music is just, well, it intoxicates me. Don't take this CD away!"
3,Buzzing guitars combine with techno-beat,"There's a lot of energy on this CD. What I couldn't get past after listening to this disc was the dance club ""techno-beat"" that pervades this CD. It's interesting to me that this disc does get a lot of airplay on the local ""hard rock"" stations. If you're looking for a couple great Canadian rock bands minus the ""techno-beat"", I would stick with Rush or Our Lady Peace."
2,gift,We bought this for our son's birthday as he had an older version and really liked the pressure idea for making the rocket fly. The guage broke soon after a couple of uses and then a friend pumped too many times as the guage didn't work and busted the pumper. Glue/apoxy and a repair and it's working again. The older version we had had a longer tether from rocket to pumper which I thought was a little better. A pain to always put together but you weren't too close to get hit. Overall a fun thing but for the price....not sure we will get again.
3,Very Thin Fabric,"Because it is ""Denim"" I was surprised out how thin the fabric is (especially considering the price). The fabric has more of a rayon/polyster feel. But it was easy to put on my couch and a whole lot easier than making my own (been there done that). I suppose it serves the purpose."
5,Everyone should see this!,"We just purchased this set & 3&4. Photography is beautiful, commentary very informative and educational. You realize what a difficult job all involved performed to accomplish this product."
5,Region 0 disc set with additional footage,"The BBC 3-disc set which I bought in London on my last trip is produced with Region 0 which will make it play in many North American players. I share the enthusiasm of the other reviewers on the 8 main parts of the show but I particularly find the additional material worth mentioning. The documentary ""Deep Trouble"" shows the damage of over exploitation and agressive fishing methods in the ocean. I recommend watching this to everyone who liked the pictures of the main episodes as a wake up-call that we are about to destroy all this beauty."
5,An amazing suspension of belief,"A science fiction fantasy told and presented as reality. Which doesn't seem like much until you realize this *is* reality. Unearthly creations both monstrous and spellbinding, painstakingly caught on video and presented in the comfort of your living room. No prior knowledge of undersea life is necessary to enjoy this visual feast. Even my 5 and 7 year-old children find this video as fascintating as those about dinasours.By the way, I brought this DVD series after reading the book of the same name. The book obviously goes into more detail but both are a highly recommended addition to your library."
4,Quite pleased....,"I gave this as a gift to someone who knows a thing or two about marine biology and fully expected that person to cite all the discrepancies and untruths each video contained. To my utter surprise (and relief!) the recipient enjoyed all 4 episodes (2 per tape, also a surprise) and actually learned a few things too!That other 2-pk (Part 3 and Part 4 of the series) is looking pretty good as a follow-up gift."
1,Flea Collar contains cancer,"I got this collar. looked at the box before opening and it said that it can cause cancer. Always wash your hands, do not touch the flee collar, dust particles will fly off of it. No thanks. Any collar that says ""cancer"" on it is not what I want on my cat or near any of my family."
3,Works well; smells bad,"Bought a Zodiac the first time, mostly for ticks because my dog is frequently in wooded areas and I use a flea control product that does not include tick control. From all indication the collar is working well. But the smell of the collar is very strong and it irritates my nose. Sort of like getting too much of a citronella smell can irritate your nose. At night, I take off the collar and put it in a plastic bag because the smell would wake me up (and the dog sleeps on the other side of the room). It has now been over a week and the smell is subsiding somewhat. I haven't had that experience with other collars."
4,Flicker Flicker,"I like Winter Circle just because they're home-town heroes (kind of). Their first debut EP, The Huge & Hopeful, is catchy and full of hooks. When I first put it in my CD player, I actually just sat and listened to the first couple songs. I'm kind of ADD, so this is a big thing. The hooks are just amazing, and the choruses are catchy. I love it!"
1,Remix should be sold as such.,"Solar Flow is a fine dvd, but should not be marketed as something separate from Yoga Shakti. There are no new sequences, just remixes of the Shakti sequences. Since you can rearrange all the Shakti sequences on your own, Solar Flow is superfluous. I don't feel a lot of shanti being swindled into purchasing the same thing twice. A little disclosure please!-Rebecca"
1,Way too fast,"This DVD is more about workout and less about yoga. Yoga has to be slow - you need to feel the stretches and have time to concentrate. While she has many good poses, she moves WAY too quickly. I barely get into one pose, look at the TV to check my pose and she already has gone through to another pose. Too much flow and too little yoga. You can perhaps watch it for entertainment value if you enjoy watching flexible women, but it's aboslutely worthless if you're actually trying to do the poses, and I'm no beginner. Perhaps if I played on 16x slow-motion I might derive some value ..."
2,Too Slow,"I have been practicing yoga for about 5 years now and I've always been interested in Shiva Rea but her yoga DVD nearly put me to sleep. For me, there's way too much talking and the flowing sequences are just way too slow for me. I think if you're a beginner, then this would be a good start because you can customize your own yoga series but if you've been practicing for a while, you may want to use something more challenging. I recommend Baron Baptiste - Power Yoga 3. That DVD will make you sweat."
2,CDs??????????,"I am a college vocal student and have a lot of books. This one is BY FAR the most expensive AND doesn't come with a CD. Really, people. Don't buy this book unless your life is hanging in the balance and this book will save you. I wish I didn't have it because I feel like by buying it I was telling the publisher that the price is right. There are tons and tons of wonderful books out there that come with CDs and are 1/2 the price of this book without the CD. As far as the music in it goes, it's a good selection."
2,Expensive and misleading,"I had to buy this book for a specific song and arrangment that was not available anywhere else, and was also led to believe that it would include the 2 CDs. HUGELY expensive for no apparent reason, and NO CDs! After reading another review, apparently the CDs are not part of the package, but I will try to contact Amazon and see why. Ripoff.Basics of Singing"
1,Total Rip Off,"Don't buy this book if you are expecting to receive the 2cd accompaniment that it specifically states it comes with! The 2 CD accompaniment is extra and you can't find it anywhere anyway! At the price they are charging for this book, it is rediculous! The first few pages, are about the basics of singing, and boy is it ever BASIC! The rest is a collection of songs in sheet music form. Who needs this? You can print this stuff out on the internet at >99 cents a page! Give me a break! Unless this is shipped with the 2cd accompaniment, you are totally wasting your money! I bought it and returned it twice because I thought that Amazon had made a mistake, (which to be honest, is the first time this has ever happened to me in 10 years!). Total rip off, don't buy it, and to think I ordered it in August of 2006, and it is now the end of May. I waited for a big fat NOTHING!"
1,Lesser than expected quality,"For the price, I expected better quality. Returning them back - my first return to Amazon in 6 yrs!"
3,"Very nice bag for my 17.3 HP laptop, except","I wish it would have come with two of the the movable side paddings. My laptop is a little bit smaller than this bag. It has one movable side padding, one more would have been nice. In my situation one side is nicely padded and the other side butts up against the other side of the case that is not padded. Overall I am satisfied with the purchase. I have added my own side makeshift padding(gardener kneeling pad sections) that seems to work pretty well."
4,Good quality and value,"The case proved to be a great fit for my Toshiba Satellite T235 13"" widescreen laptop with the padded spacer (included) installed. Would be a good fit for a 14"" with the spacer removed. The main compartment is deep enough that it can accommodate a slim external DVD drive (in a case of course, to prevent scratching) as well as an ultralight laptop. Fabric, stitching and zipper quality all are good.I wish there were a dedicated pocket for the power pack. This is the one accessory that you are sure to be carrying. The only external pocket is rather slim and stiff and if you put the power pack into it, you risk cracking or scratching any DVDs that share the space. This is the reason I don't give it five stars."
5,The best case for the price!!,"I am extremely impressed with this case. I bought it for my Macbook Air 13"" (2010) and it is perfect. Small and slim but still holds all necessary cords. An additional compartment holds pens, id cards, etc. This case is better than some of the expensive ones i've looked at and its half the price!! I highly recommend this case by caselogic!"
3,size not clear,"the size computer it would hold was overstated. up to 17"" is stretching it.my HP 17"" was to big for the case. Otherwise the case was fine.If you have a computer bigger than 15.6 look at other models."
5,Just what i wanted,"This is what i wanted, i have a 16inch laptop, and i wanted the laptop and the charger to fit next to each other and they fit well."
5,Great Case!,had this for years and it has lasted great! some wear but still works great and handle and everything still in tact.
3,Laptop Case,I used it for several months before the case strap broke. I continue to use it with another strap. It has a good amount of pockets for all your needs. I recommend this product.
1,Looks nice at first,"I am very disappointed that after only having this product one month, the strap broke. The seller ""Everything's Discounted"" did not respond to me despite me attempting contact twice.This is a cheaply made strap on the case. The rest of it works fine so far."
4,perfect size for me,"I purchased this laptop case for my 17"" Dell laptop. It is just the right size for me. No difficulty using it and it is streamlined and easy to carry. I don't carry too much with me, but there is sufficient room if needed. I am very pleased with my purchase."
4,"Reasonable price, great case!","I did not own a case for my 17-inch laptop, so I purchased this based on the reasonable price and positive reviews by other customers. I am very pleased with the purchase. It accommodates my laptop perfectly, and has lots of pockets for holding papers, mouse, power cord, etc. I would definitely recommend it!"
4,Good Case,"Thought it was a little on the cheap side when I first got it, but after using it, I think it will suit my needs pretty well. Would like to see a little more padding all around. Am thinking of buying a sleeve to give it a little more padding.fits a 15.6"" screen with room for a mouse and power cords. Like the fact that you can use the computer without taking out of the case. Adequate storage for pens and such. Will have to see how it holds up, but don't think you can beat it for the price. Save your receipts, packing says it comes with a 25 year quality guarantee."
4,Good product for the price,"This case very easily holds my 17 inch laptop and all of its cords. There's not much room for anything extra, however. The construction seems sturdy and well made. Very pleased with this and the price was great."
5,schofly,I love this product. It was delivered on time in excellent condition. It is just perfect for me and wiil be for those who need a case that is simple and durable for keeping your laptop safe when traveling.
5,Great Bag!,"Really nothing exciting to say. The bag does what it says it does. Really my only complaint is that the shoulder strap is a hair to small, but you can't beet the price for the quality.Ty Wilde""Everything I Touch Turns to Sold (Advice on How to Become a Top Sales Professional From a Top Producer)"""
5,Very good case.,"I have had this for over 3 years. It is durable, but does have some small frayed threads (hardly noticeable) at the edges. I love it. Has a cell phone pocket, pocket for stuff like a webcam and mouse. It also has a moveabble strap with foam inside that seperates the laptop from power adaptor."
3,Good case for the money,Good case for the money. Just wanted something to carry the laptop in when travelling.
5,Great bargain!,"Having purchased a ""big screen"" lap top, it was difficult to find a case that would fit and still have room for all the accessories. This one is perfect. Well made, lot of compartments and a perfect fit. Great value for the money."
5,Clean and Simple,The pooter fits in it and it is a handsome bag. I have not had it long enough to comment on durability but it looks very well made.
1,Very Nice,"This case was exactly what I was looking for. It is meant to carry your laptop, some disks, power cable, perhaps a mouse and some papers. It will not accomodate an entire briefcase worth of work. It is functional and good looking and has various different compartments for storage. I recommend it."
1,"Missing strap, got screwed","I ordered this case from Amazon for my HP laptop. When it arrived, the clearly shown strap was missing. Amazon expects you to return the whole thing, which costs more than buying an aftermarket replacement. Caselogic says its Amazon's problem. I have bought Caselogic before, and had no problems."
1,A month????,I ordered this item over 3 weeks ago. I never received any confirmation of the order and now I see it is taking over a month to se3nd it to me? I will just go elsewhere for this and make sure others are aware of the lack of contact and the untimely way things are handled. Considering what I do for a living this will get around
1,Falls Apart !!!,"Pros:1. Light weightCons:1. Poorly made:- Within 24 hours of use, the zipper broke (the part that you pull on came off from the zipper track). I hammered the loose part onto the zipper myself to fix it (it was quicker than returning it).- Strap broke within about 3 weeks of use. The strap is attached by plastic hooks with a relatively thin wire clip securing the strap hook onto the bag handles (SEE THE PICTURES). The wire bent, came out of its holes and no longer secures the strap hook in place, leading to me dropping my laptop a few times, whenever the strap hook unhinges itself.- The zipper handle broke again, leading to me loosing the part after about 4 weeks of use.2. I personally do not like the fact that the main laptop compartment opens up completely, 180 degrees rather than from the top only. This was especially aggravating when the zipper broke and everything inside could fall out."
1,The Logic Is Flimsy...And So Is The Bag!,"Based this purchase on quality of Case Logic CD cases I had in the past and reviews, unfortunately this was a waste of money. I have a 17"" HP laptop and it fit very well, I loved all the pockets, but after just a couple of days, the strap that holds the computer in place came out the seams, I was dissapointed at the shoddy work but was able to overlook it then the next day the small cheap metal mechanism that connects the shoulder stap to the bag popped off during my trip out of the country. I wasted my limited funds on such shoddy work and will see if I can get a refund. I couldn't enjoy even a month's use of it. Pass this item up and look for a better upgrade or manufacturer."
4,Great case but not for a heavy laptop,"I bought an ASUS G53JW-XA1 laptop and it is HEAVY. The case itself is really great aside form the ugly logo on it, but I'm picky. It has plenty of compartments inside and was amazed that it could hold not only my over sized laptop, large battery, portable hard drive and all the cables without even bulging. However this may have contributed to the problem I had. The hook where the strap meets the case snapped. I still use the case but without the shoulder strap. In any event, it should have been able to hold it but perhaps I was exceeding it's limits.Nevertheless, great case."
1,"Nice looking bag, crappy strap.",This was definitely a good looking bag but the strap and hooks lasted about a month. Not worth it if your laptop goes careening to the floor
4,Laptop Case,"We purchased the Case Logic VNC-17 laptop case for a HP G71-340US laptop with a 17.3"" screen. I was a little concerned that it might not be wide enough but it works great even with one of the short USB wireless mouse transmitters installed. It may be a little better product if it were padded a little more. Not a bad value. Delivery time was very acceptable."
5,Case Logic VNC-13,"Case Logic VNC-13 13-inch Value Slimline Laptop CaseI purchased three of these: One for my eleven-year-old daughter, one for my eighty-year old mom and one for myself. We all have 13.3 inch MacBooks or MacBook Pros, and the cases fit like a glove.I keep my power cord in the outer pocket, my transformer in the inner pocket, and my computer in the padded pocket. I keep important papers to which I want immediate access in the outer folder.I schlep my MacBook Pro with me everywhere I go (I'm a physician) and the Laptop Case helps me stay well organized with minimal effort.In a word, this product is excellent, works perfectly, and is the best value unit in its classHIGHLY REGARDED and a coupled with Amazon's excellent service, a TOP VALUE."
5,Perfect bag for my 17.3 HP laptop,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome, bag. Pleanty of room for my 17.3 HP laptop. I love all the pockets it has and the room too. Great buy. a must have for anyone with a big laptop."
5,Great Bag,"I love this bag!It was hard to find a good quality 17"" laptop bag, and this one meets all my needs. It has plenty of storage room in it."
3,laptop case,"functional, adequate room for storage of laptop and accessories. Outermost zippered pocket requires folding an 8 x 11.5 sheet to store, just a little short"
5,Great case.,"I have a HP dv7-1175nr and I was looking for a case for it. I saw this and did look nice for me. I bought it, and I love it. I'm a tall guy, so the case and the laptop fit with me. When a friend of mine, who has other 17"" laptop, saw my case, he ask me where to buy it. We're really happy with our cases."
4,Good value,"I gave my husband a new laptop computer for Christmas. He needed a carrying case for it so I ordered this one from Amazon. He likes it a lot.It holds everything he needs and seems sturdy enough. The only reason I gave it just four stars is, it's tight squeeze to get the mouse in the side pockets. Yes, he has a touchpad on the laptop, but he likes to use a wireless mouse instead.Otherwise, it's a nice case."
2,Case Logic VNC-15 laptop case,"The case is of good quality, sturdy and well padded, however when I put my Toshiba 15"" laptop in the case and adjust the velcro divider, it does not leave enough room to store the charger/power cords, and if you store them in an outside pouch they bulge and defeat the purpose of the slim profile. I went with the 17"" case for my laptop and I am pleased with the fit!"
3,Good quality for money,"A case for a 17.3"" laptop is hard to find and when you do find one, they are quite expensive. This one is satisfactory for the amount of times I will be using it. Which will not be a lot, but it will protect my Dell and and make it easier to carry. Well worth the price, plus I got free shipping."
4,"Great for a small portable 10"" LCD TV","I got this for a 10"" portable battery operated LCD TV and it was a decent fit.Well made, and well padded."
2,Caselogic VNC 15 Laptop Case,"This is not a very durable product. Within 45 days, the handle ripped away from the case after very little use. It is just a stitched handle and not reinforced in anyway. Not what I expect from Caselogic products. I do not recommend the VNC-15 model."
3,"Case is cool, strap stinks","This well-padded case is more than big enough for my 17"" HP laptop. Be careful with the included strap though. The clip where the strap attaches to the case broke on me as I was getting out of a taxi and the whole thing fell to the sidewalk. My laptop did not suffer any damage though. I replaced the strap and still use the case regularly."
3,Laptop Case,"Frankly, this is a nice case but the zipper pulls come off very easily. After some minor mods it works fine. I'd buy it again."
5,Laptop Case,"This is for me and it's just right for what I wantedit to be. the price is right,Love..It.really love this.."
5,I love it,It was a really good decision getting this laptop case. I can fit everything I need to fit there.
4,It is logic choice..,For an under 20 USD. laptop bag I think this is one of the best option.Quite seems slim and fit..
5,My Case For My First Laptop Computer,"I love my new laptop case. I was skeptical when I ordeed it....it seemed too good to be true for the price. It arrived very quickly which, of course, pleased me. When I unpacked it, I was very happy with it. I was even happier when I packed my laptop in the new case to take on a long weekend trip shortly after it arrived. It was everything I was looking for in a laptop case. I had shopped in local stores and could not find anything to compare with it for the price. Pat J."
5,Good travel case for the money,"I was very pleased when I received this case. I had already seen this case since a friend had the exact item. He has used the case on many trips and has had no negative response with it. I too found it to be very good for the money spent. The zippers work fine and the space inside is more than adequate for my use. I have a 16"" Toshiba laptop but I also use a travel sleeve. I decided to buy the 17"" case since I use the sleeve. Glad I bought the case one inch larger due to the travel sleeve since it would have been a really tight fit had I purchased the 16"" case or I would have had to return to make room for the sleeve. If you use a travel sleeve in addition to a case, I would recommend you purchase one inch larger to make room for the sleeve."
5,Im Jealous,I bought this laptop case for my moms birthday. I bought it for less than i bought my own and it way better. you can use your laptop while it sits in the case which i convenient when you dont have a lot of table space or when doing school work. the zip pockets are also large and efficient. Over all i would have to say im jealous that my mom has this and i dont.
4,what more do you need?,"No frills, no bells or whistles, it's not made of doeskin soft leather and doesn't make a fashion statement; it just works. I have a laptop with a 14.1 inch screen, and after reading other reviews which commented on tight squeeze, I decided to get a case larger than the laptop. This is just the right fit. There's an adjustable compartment inside so I can snugly fit the Laptop in with room for cables and converter. There are compartments for CD's and pens and paper and cables, and yes, I even carry my Kindle along for the ride. It's well-padded and sleek, and looks as though it will last at least as long as the technology inside."
3,Strap hook broke in 3 months,"Just three months of minimal use and a shoulder strap hook is broken. At least the case protected my laptop when it hit the ground immediately after the strap broke. Other than that, the bag WAS perfect for my 15"" Macbook pro."
5,Great Item,This is a great item it ft my 15inch laptop with no problems and had enough space to put a couple notebooks and charger and it also looks great.
3,Nice case but strap wasn't too sturdy,"The case itself is great since it's large and there's lots of room for the laptop and pockets for other things. Less than a week after I started using the case, one of the strap clips broke off and I had to go out and buy a new strap. I hadn't given it too much use, so I wasn't too happy with that. Other than that, I haven't had any problems with it."
4,Fits Like a Glove!,"I have a Vostro 13 inch laptop. It is an exact fit inside the case. There is no extra room inside for the power cord. You can cram the power cord in one of the outside pockets, tight fit. If you're looking for safely carrying your 13"" laptop, this is it. If you're looking to carry your extras, go larger."
5,Excelent Light Computer Bag,"I bought this computer bag to house my new ASUS UL30 (light 3.3 lb.) computer and couldn't be more pleased. It is light with plenty of room to carry adapter, cord, and other things if you desire to do so in it's main zipped pocket. Main pocket includes place for pen, as well as net area where I keep ear buds, check book, etc. It also has a place where a letter size document can be carried. On the back side it has an unzipped pocket where a letter sized file can be carried. This bag has a great deal of utility considering it's small size and weight. One of the best bags I have for the money and I have a Dell, Toshiba, Asus Net Book, and an old Howard Computer all with bags ranging from expensive Samsonite on down. I would recommend this bag for anyone looking for a light computer carrying case. Women should consider this one if they carry a computer for business on a daily basis."
2,*THUD!*,"I read through so many reviews before purchasing this item... I even saw the one about the strap that broke. Seeing that I only saw one review on the broken strap and so many other good reviews, I decided to purchase it. It came just in time for my vacation to NY. The item had a cheap feel to it when I opened it. I was traveling at the airport (2nd day after receiving, but first time using) and before I got a chance to sit down at the outlet stations, i heard *THUD*... Yes, my laptop and the bag went crashing to the ground. The part that sewed the strap on one end must have been poorly done because the threads came off. You would think the craftsmanship on those areas are well done, but they aren't. I had to carry my laptop bag with the handle hoping that wouldn't break off too for the entire vacation. It made traveling very inconvenient. Luckily, I was able to contact Amazon right away and they said I could get refunded for this item."
3,"Great case, but needs improvement",Overall the case is very nice. Has plently of compartments that i can use. The only part of the gave me problems was the strap. I found that it wasnt very durable and it broke on me only a week after using it. If possible i would change this part.
4,Fast shipping,"This item was exactly as the description in amazon, and it was shipped as promise. I am very happy with the item, because it fit my needs."
4,"Great product,great price","I needed an inexpensive case to carry my laptop on an occasional trip. It wouldn't be used on a daily basis but I still wanted a durable case that would last a long time. This case fills that need. It has several compartments and slots for storing whatever I need to include, the zippers are sturdy and the case material is durable. I would recommend this case to anyone who needed something either for part-time or full-time use."
4,Laptop case works as expected,Arrived on time and fits my 17 in laptop with a little room to spare. Zipper on the main compartment was a little sketchy at first. But it seems to have worn in after a week or so of use. I only use the handle for transportation and not the shoulder strap. So wish there was a way to remove the strap attachments on the sides of the case.
4,great bag for the price,This bag is cheaper than many of the other offerings on Amazon. And it is a great product and gets the job done.
3,17 INCH LAPTOP CASE,NICE PRODUCT BUT BARELY BIG ENOUGH FOR THE LAPTOP. NO ROOM FOR THE EXTERNAL POWER CORD.
4,Fantastic fit...worth the money,"I bought this bag mid-way through my fall semester for my newly purchased Macbook Pro 13.1 inch. It fit really well. The Velcro strap on the inside of the computer compartment holds the laptop in place and if your laptop is smaller than 13 inches, there is an optional adjusting foam bar (Velcro attached).This fit my computer, my power cord, a wireless mouse, a binder, a 70 page journal, a few random cords (for my iPod, etc), a few pens and pencils, and even my compact 500GB external drive all at once.This bag is fantastic for someone who would like to carry a 13 inch (or smaller) laptop around as well as a few accessories with it. It's held up well for the second half of my semester, and will likely see a lot more use in the future."
5,The best buy for such a great price!!!!!,"Trust me, this amazing notebook case is one of the best on the web, and the price is probably the lowest you'll find anywhere. I bought it for a 16"" hp notebook, and there were at least 2"" to spare but that was not a problem because it has an adjustable pad inside to make sure that any size fits tight and is secured inside especially with the inner strap that really holds the laptop tight and prevents any movement. The case has plenty of pockets for practically any related supplies: pens, notes, mice, USB Flash Drives, the laptop Power Supply, etc. It also has a firm adjustable shoulder strap with a shoulder pad for carrying comfort. You just can't go wrong with this one, and I guarantee that it will fit any laptop within the 17.5"" range. I highly recommend this product!! Way to go Case Logic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Case Logic VNC-17 17-inch Value Slimline Laptop Case (Black)"
4,"Love this case, extra room for some papers and sturdy","You can tell pretty quickly that it is nicely made. It has held up really nice for the last 6 months, considering the abuse I have had to put it through. I like that it does not weigh a lot or take up a bunch of room. The case is light and easy to use. Works well except that it nice fits my a 17"" laptop."
3,Functional but cheap looking,"This is a very low priced case, but it looks the part. All fasteners are plastic, the strap looks cheap, and it just generally looks a bit cheesy. It's also a bit big for my average-sized laptop - you could fit a monster computer in here but the space is wasted for me. There is a nicely functional pocket for papers, and the accessories pocket is a good size. The front pocket (the little horizontal zipper on the accessories pocket) is nearly worthless, as the zipper is hard to access and the pocket itself is tiny. If you're looking for functionality and a low price, this would work well. I'm a bit embarrassed to carry it to meetings at work, though."
5,Case Logic very logical,"Excellent case, ample storage, well made, no complaints. Excellent price, I checked out several sites, even my most frequented, and this was the best price available."
4,case logic vnc-17,"I have a heavy 17 inch HP laptop that I needed a bag for. This case logic bag has been great. it has enough pockets for me to keep a folder/binder in side it as well along with the charger, pens, wallet, phone etc. I only had one problem with the bag since I received it. the clasp on the the end of the strap broke the 3rd day I had it. I was no big deal, i just swapped out straps from a duffel bag. Other than that I think the bag is excellent and I am glad i purchased this bag."
2,3 months in and it's broken,"I loved the bag. I would squeeze in my 17.3 laptop, power cord, and even my intuos 4 wacom medium drawing tablet. Things were great... what a relief from the sleeve with the shoulder strap with no support... until one day my zipper on the side of the bag (that holds other stuff like pens, my external hard drive and more)became stuck inside of the corner of the zipped part.... huh? Yeah, that's what I was thinking when I noticed it. I have little hands/fingers and still couldn't stick my fingers or anything int there to get it out. How did this happen?!?!The bag was zipped up at the time and while I was trying to get the zipper out, the zipped part started to become unzipped while it was still zipped from the stuck side which was zipped.I needed my car keys out so I had to break the zip completely to get in there. The zipper came off and that's it. I have to use a clip to hold the side flap together... cheap and looks poor. Nice new laptop with a raggedy bag. :0/"
5,Good Basic Computer Case,I have used this case on several trips to haul a 17 in laptop and support items (including folders). It worked well and I was pleased for the performance vs. the price.
5,Clarion clear....,"As far as I'm concerned, poetry is the place for wordsmiths. You can run them off the ranch when it comes to fiction. What you want is compelling drama, and Genevieve brings it on a platter. If you want plain prose that rings clarion clear, and reaches into your heart, this novel will do so. Novelized, but taken from a true story, Genevieve of Tombstone speaks truth in every sentence. Don't miss this one if you want the REAL west. Larry Jay Martin, author of Last Stand, Sounding Drum, Shadow of the Grizzly, etc."
5,A Marvelous Creation,"A marvelous creation,brimming with passion, honesty, and grit. The reader emerges with that good warm feeling one gets only when having met flesh and blood characters. Genevieve's rise from the bordellos of Tombstone to respectable womanhood sticks in the mind long after the last page."
1,Overpriced and does not match recyle material of paper shred,"This is ridiculously overpriced for bags to dump shreded garbage.All you have to do it dump you shedders basket into any garbage bag or waste recepticle to empty the contents for trash.If you recyle, this product makes no sence to mix plastic with paper.I find this product a waste on money... and can be equally substituted with kitchen garbage bags at less than half the cost."
3,Amazon providing the wrong dimensions,"The product dimensions that Amazon.com provides tells the consumer NOTHING about the individual bags. The dimensions that Amazon provides are for the container (the box) that contains the bags. The volume description of the bags tells us nothing of the dimensions, either. For some reason, the manufacturers of these bags use a formula to calculate the volume that is completely different from any mathematical formula of which I am aware. Try measuring out one of these bags and using the dimensions to calculate the volume; and then compare your solution to the stated volume on the package - there will be a large difference - always."
2,cheap material. you get what you pay for,Very thin. Tear easy.. Not what I expected.. but the price was good.. Not the same as what come with shredder
1,"Poor quality, extremely thin, small bags.","I agree with most other reviewers of this product. These bags are vastly *inferior* to the bags which ship with the shredder. I also contacted Fellowes, and they said that the bags which ship with the unit are unavailable for purchase. These inferior bags are the only bags they sell. This is unfortunate, because the shredder is first quality, and the are blemishing the Fellowes brand by selling inferior bags.I should have read the reviews before I purchased these bags, as I would have looked elsewhere. I was told by Fellowes that the # 36053 (not sold by Amazon) bags are slightly thicker and larger but still not nearly as good as the bags which ship with the unit.Overall I am disappointed in the response of Fellowes. In this difficult economy one would hope they would be interested in both (a) earning more money and (b) responding to customer complaints by selling a better product."
1,just buy garbage bags,"These bags neither fit nor hold up well...in fact, they are pricey and useless. Just buy garbage bags and forgo the ""Fellows"" price gouging.Fellowes Powershred Waste Bags for Personal Shredders - 100 BagsIn fact, although the Fellowes shredder is excellent, if all I knew about Fellowes was based upon their name upon these flimsy and overpriced plastic bags, I'd not purchase anything from them!"
3,Shredding like crazy,These bags are very good and convenient to use. I do need to double bag them before placing them in the recycle. The bags are a bit thin and when pulling a full bag out of the shredder it catches on sharp areas inside and tears it every time. I then need to put it into another bag to close it to ensure all stays in the bag.
4,A Plastic Bag is a Plastic Bag,"The bags are fine, although getting them (and the ties) out of the box is not a simple process. I sure wish they had an elastic collar or means to tie them to or around the container so that debris does not spill out if the bag is not fitted just so."
1,Re-Use Supplied Bags,"We have a Fellow's 87c Shredder. We did massive amounts of shredding in the months following our purchase. I like the few bags they supplied with the Shredder, so instead of buying disposables, we simply emptied out the bags into our garbage. It only takes a second, and you might get a couple confetti pieces here or there, but there was never any need to buy disposable bags. Now after reading the other reviews I'm glad we didn't buy them. I suppose you could use other types of less expensive trash liners, but I recommend just dumping the shredded paper into your recycle bin or trash can and reusing the durable plastic that came with the unit."
1,Not really necessary --,"These are ok, but they don't really fit well in to the collection area. I'm sure you could find a better fitting bag."
2,Does the job.,It does the job. What else can I say. Good addition to my shredder. Okay that's pretty much all I have to say.
2,Fellowes Bags,I was somewhat disappointed in the weight of the bag. The bags included with the shredder were a heavier duty bag and these are quite thin and tear easy. I'd save my money and buy a normal trash can liner which is the same weight next time if this is all Fellowes can produce.
1,Am I missing something?,"Shredded paper goes in your recycle bin; plastic bags do not. I had not thought of using a bag, but there are biodegradeable tall kitchen bags and smaller food waste bags that I guess could be used."
1,these rip easily. Not the same as the bags included with my new Fellowed MS-460ci shredder,"I expected these to be of the same quality as the bags that came with theFellowes MS-460Ci 100% Jam Proof Micro-Cut Shredder (32406).They were not. Their quality is cheap, poor durability, and the rip way too easily.I'm going to return these.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY"
3,Disappointing bags,It would be nice to have the bags a little longer for easier closing to filled to the max. The shredder container can hold more than the bags and it should be the opposite. I will be moving to regular clear garbage bags when these are gone or before.
3,I think I'll try tall kitchen bags...,"Fits the bin of my Fellowes shredder nicely so minimizes loose chads, but way too expensive for 100 plastic bags. these should definitely be made only from recycled plastics, I think."
3,Sincere but amateur,"I gave this one three because the film maker's effort to get to the heart of our current international situation deserves respect. This documentary includes some intense interviews and a lot of personal opinion. That is why I couldn't give it 5 stars. She does a great job with every aspect of this film except for being impartial. The best documentaries ,especially in this political climate, need to present the facts in a way that leaves the viewer with the room to make their own opinions. Pointing fingers at this country or that or this Intelligence agency or that regime at this point is redundant. They are all corrupt. All problems we are facing now as a species boil down to greed. Tigers kill only what they need, no more, sometimes less. We kill and consume and take more than we need. This is why we face what we do at this moment. I elect Chomsky to the Global Guides to the Good Future. Listen to that man. Check this one out just for his interview if nothing else."
1,I would not recommend,"I purchased this product and returned it in 3 days. It would play for 20 minutes and then the DVD would spin out of control and the unit would heat up. This happenned in the car and plugged into the wall. Also, when you adjusted the screen, the picture would fade out and it need to be moved up and down to finally get the screen to come back. I bought the Panasonic LV70 and it is a much better product in my opinion ( light, solid, incredible sound ). The Audiovox also became VERY hot when played for short period of time and the unit was incredibly heavy."
1,1680 is much better,"I originally purchased this model instead of the Audiovox 1680 because I prefer the widescreen setup. However, this unit was nothing but trouble. It is flimsy and was unable to play several newly purchased DVDs. Further, the method for recharging the battery was really unintuitive and clumsy. I returned it in favor of the 1680. The 1680 is very solid (and heavy) and despite the fact that it has a more traditional television width ratio, I have been very happy with the unit both as a portable and as a home DVD player."
2,"Problems, problems",We purchased this model about 15 months ago. Our original unit had to be immediately returned because the screen would freeze and then the movie would skip forward. Our 2nd unit has functioned well until recently. Now the same problem is occuring (screen freezing and skipping). Audiovox will not honor the warranty (it's 2 months after the 1-year has expired) and wants $165 flat fee to fix it. Not real thrilled with this company. I would look elsewhere.
1,"Defective ""New"" Product","I purchased this item at a very special reduced price and it was supposed to be brand new in the box. However, after I tried to use it for the first time, I couldn't even get it to power up into the ""Welcome"" screen. All I got was a blank display. I tried this several times with the same result. Needles to say, I couldn't get it to play any of my DVD's. Also, the remote control didn't work (I checked the battery and it was OK). There was a ""Best Buy"" sticker on the battery pack that came with the unit, so I assume it was rejected once before for the same problem. So, I returned the unit back to Amazon.com for a credit to my account. I was disappointed that this supposedly new unit was defective just out of the box."
2,Poor customer service,"I needed a new replacement for the USB battery charger for the D1700 and when I contacted customer services they said so sorry, discontinued. I you have one to sell: martinw@lisco.com"
3,I like it BUT...,"I've been having the same problems with my D1700 as the others..it will skip, freeze and otherwise act irratically sometimes. But sometimes it will work perfectly, and when it does, it is a wonderful thing to have. You can hook it up to any TV in your house and watch DVD's on the big screen. You can take it with you in the car (or, in my case, on the commuter train)and watch movies any time. ... The customer service site online is very helpful and will respond quickly to service inquiries. Audiovox sent me a new D1700...and it works a little better than the first one---but this one skips sometimes too!! VERY disappointing!"
2,better alternatives,"Considering that you can get DVD player functionality in most laptops, I would steer clear of this. Why would you want to bring this in addition to your laptop on a trip? Besides, most laptop screens are bigger than this and what do you need when you want to watch a movie? The biggest portable screen you can get!"
4,I THINK IT'S A GOOD PORTABLE DVD PLAYER,I HAVE HAD MINE FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND REALLY LIKE IT. MY KIDS LOVE TO WATCH MOVIES WHEN WE GO OUT OF TOWN IN THE CAR. KEEPS THEM QUIET!I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANY PROBLEMS WITH MINE.
1,Hail To the Mediocre,"When I first heard about this game, I couldn't wait to get it. Now that I own it, I feel like going skeet shooting with the discs.The movie aspects of the game are really cool, but thats about it. Ash is extremely difficult to control. Weapon selection is very limited. The graphics look like something from the mid 90s and the number of deadites become annoying after about five minutes.I can't believe Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi actually allowed themselves to be associated with this [game]. If you've never seen the Evil Dead Trilogy, do yourself a favor and watch it, just stay clear of Hail To the King.BTW, I gave this one star, but seriously, it's really not even that good."
4,Old Heroes die hard,"This is another game that involves a lot of key board word on the gamers part, but don't let that stop you from getting it. The game plays pretty good even though you have to keep reloading your weapons and filling you gas tank. That just means you have to work a little harder to beat the game."
1,So much potential,"Basically a pathetic rip-off of Resident Evil with a model that looks nothing like Bruce Campbell. It's just no-good. Got it cause Evil Dead movies rule, but this game just sucks, no two ways about it."
2,"Win Some, Loose Some","Certainly not the best of Woody. Yes, there IS Zelig and Hannah and Her Sisters, but the rest of the collection I think even Woody would like to forget."
4,SOG knive from Amazon,"Great SOG knive, very sharp and well made.I carry this knive for protection, hopefully I will never have to use it."
3,"Big hope , small disappointment .","When I took the knife from the box I got a feeling that something missing . Later I understood what it was . Vulcan VL-01 has a thick , heavy , well made blade and light , looking cheap and unreliable handle . Handle has good grip but it has inappropriately light weight in comparison with the blade . It is not quite comfortable to use the knife . Pocket clip is made of cheap steel, with playing from side to side , disappointing . Gerber and Kershaw knives have better pocket clip . Overall knife is overpriced . Arc-Lock is not much better than liner lock . I wouldn't buy Vulcan VL-01 if I hadn't paid much less than retailers price. You would be better to buy Kershaw or Gerber for everyday use . But if you want to have one more knife in your collection take Vulcan VL-01 ."
3,Not a strong book,"This book does it well by starting with JSP and dealing with Java later (a must?). Yet it only slightly mentions custom tags (right at the end). The writing is clear, but the contents could have been better. Beginners will feel they have a firm grasp, but they may be wrong."
2,Could have been useful,"I am a complete newbie to JSP and Servelets and Beans. I have gone through Java tutorials, but that was awhile ago and I remember very little. This book did not help me to understand very much, and and there was little help on getting everything setup. I could not get any of the JSP examples that used beans to run, and ended up wasting a lot of time trying to set things up and weaving my way through various XML files.The book looked like it has potential if you can get the examples running."
2,very basic jsp book,the book hardly gave me any new information on JSP. Most of the information is incomplete. My advice will be to use JSP tutotials available at java.sun.com
4,Good Book for Beginners,"JavaServer Pages by Larne Pekowsky is geared to the Web designer instead of the Java developer. In the book, there is a tutorial on creating a JSP web site with dynamic content. The book is easy to read and shows the reader how to create a web site using JSP. The book introduces aspects of JSP as needed for the tutorial web site.The second half of the book introduces the Java code needed for the tags in the first half of the book. It starts with a short chapter on writing Java code, and then introduces Java Beans, Servlets, and JSPs. This section provides as basic introduction to JSP programming. Also, the section introduces the MVC design pattern.This is is more geared for web designers who want to learn JSP and not for a Java programmer who want to learn JSP. Advanced topics of JSP are not fully covered in this book, so this book is not a complete reference. I would recommend this book to someone just learning JSP."
2,Very mediocre book,"I was hoping to learn more about JSPs, but got an overview of JSPs, JDBC, Servlets.Stay away from this book."
2,Good overview but....,"This book provides a relatively good overview of the JSP technology. The first few chapters were very clear and informative. However, in later chapters the author jumps into JavaBeans without much explanation and the remainder of the book feeds off of that. I also found many grammatical errors and even a completely erroneous code listing. Consequently, I would say save your $40.00 and wait for a better book on JSP."
3,Good book for beginners,"I have to say that the book is a great overview of JSP. Larne Pekowsky does a great job of explaining how JSP works and how to incorporate Java into your page. It's a good book for beginners.However, watch out for the examples in the book. Most have some minor problems with them such as the wrong package name. So, if you try to use the beans that are supplied on the cd, they won't necessarily work."
3,Good for beginner,"If you are an inexperience Java programmer starting to learn JSP, this is the book for you. The author holds your hand as he goes through the features one by one.While there are codes sprinkled over the text, it is not too excessive and serves their points very well. It's a good refresher for the experienced, though it might not be worth the $$$. Hardcore programmers should be reading the book ""Web Development with JavaServer Pages"" by by Fields, Duane K. / Kolb, Mark A."
2,Only for beginners,"The information from this book can easily be grabbed from the web at Sun's JSP site. This book lacks depth. It basically tells you some JSP basics but won't get you far in developing any serious applications. I relate it to an HTML for dummies book that tells you how to code basic HTML for your homepage. Get Web Development with JavaServer Pages. Much more bang for the buck, for beginners and beyond."
2,beans,"If you want to know how to include a bean in your jsp's than this is a graet book, otherwise it is not very helpful. Unless you look at the online version from the cd you will be lost as to why and what the beans are doing. Beans are also used very extensively. the author does not seem to concentrate very much on the true subject."
2,OK Beginner Book,"This is an OK book for beginners. However, if you are a seasoned Java Engineer looking for discussions and examples of different architectures for distributed applications using JSP as a front end, look elsewhere."
5,An excellent JSP book by a superb writer,"I was fortunate in being able to look at this book while in manuscript, having been one of its tech reviewers. Mr. Pekowsky is a very gifted author and in addition, he really knows his stuff. He has a wonderful way of presenting technical matters in a crystalline-clear fashion.The JSP material in the book covers the complete gamut from elementary (e.g., jsp at an html-ish level) through advanced (e.g., jsp accessing java beans). Throughout the book the discussion is motivated in the context of putting together a fictional, Slashdot-like ""Java News Today"" (JNT) Web site. Besides being a good teaching tool, the JNT examples should be useful for cut-and-paste use by readers.I think good JSP's are pretty tough to write, and especially to debug. If you're interested in JSP programming, you'll need all the help you can get. This book will assist mightily."
2,Not nearly as good as their first book,"I liked the first Electric Bread cookbook much better. Most of the recipes in this one were too ""unusual"" for me and the recipes haven't caught my interest enough for me to even want to try most of them. It does have a extensive section of recipes you can make using the dough cycle. If you like to use your bread machine's dough cycle for handshaped breads & baked goods, then you will probably enjoy this book --but if you're mainly interested in baking loaves of bread, I'd skip this book."
5,Great read,"I had the pleasure of having Dr. Ohm as an instructor while attending Washburn University in Topeka. It wasn't until several years after I graduated that I ran into Dr. Ohm at a book signing. As the one reviewer stated - this is the type of book that people should read. It will slow you down (in a good way) - and let you smell the roses (as it were).The reader is transported back to a simpler time - before all the electronic gizmos that now seem to demand our time. The people are real. The places are real. And they are brought to us by a writer who lived it. I just can't get my head around the fact that Dr. Ohm was a kid at one time! Just as my kids cannot grasp that concept either.I do hope that he writes another book where the last one stopped. In these days, we could use it."
4,Its Aiight!!!!,This is Noreaga being himself. He rapped so dope on the songs that are phat. But on the songs that arent good he sounds horrible. Dont get me wrong the good songs outnumber the bad ones. I cant wait until the new Capone & Noreaga album comes out because Noreaga is better when he raps with Capone.
4,N.O.R.E. Is H.O.T.!!!!,"Noreaga's stylings and unparalleled slang(which I call Norebonics), are what the rap game needs today. Enough of this Cristal-poppin', ice-rockin' B.S. Let's take it back to the essence. I'm just waiting on the Thugged Out compilation album."
5,Check out NORE's song Blood Money!!!,"This song has brought to rap what i have been saying to introduce for years: scitars. This song has a sort of arabian, towel head, camel jockey sound. Really Wackee yo!! Of course im loco!!!!!LMFAOROF"
3,"N.O.R.E., not all it's cracked up to be!!!!!!","The beats on the album are tight, but his rhymes miss the mark. His style is too monotonous... but a little help from Nature, Big PUN, Cam'ron, da LOX, and Carl Thomas does help break the monotony. In the end, the album does leave much to be desired in regard to lyrical content. All I can say is,""Where's Capone when U need him???"""
5,A testimony to human conditions & human emotions...,David Newman's perspectives on life and its relevant issues are unique and wonderfully refreshing. I would like to hire him as a motivational guru! (really)
2,"beware, not mike patton/dan automator Lovage","different band than the great Mike Patton/Dan the Automator Lovage. I wish i knew before i bought it, but no opinion on it, haven't listened to it mcuh yet."
3,Lady Bug Tea Set,"I bought this set for my four year old granddaughter. It is adorable, but really tiny. We can not put more than a couple of tablespoons of liquid in the teapot and not more than a tablespoon in the cups. However, she still loves it and we have great fun having tea parties. This will work for her and her doll babies better, but not so much with grandpa's big hands. The basket it comes in is darling and the little silverware set is, too. Just much smaller than I anticipated."
2,Very small & fragile,"The set has a cute design, but tiny. My daughter was disappointed at the size of the tea set. The quality of the set we received was disappointing-the lid of the tea pot was chipped; one of the spoon broke apart when it was played for the first time."
2,Not-durable and Tiny,"I purchased this tea set for my niece and was disappointed by the size. It was a lot smaller than i thought, it's more of a miniature tea set which is fragile. One of the handles of from the cups, broke off right after use. This is definitely not a very usable or sturdy tea set."
3,Very Small,"This is a very cute set but very small, the basket is very small also. I ordered the Deluxe Ceramic Tea Set with Basket also and like it much better. Sending this one back."
4,cute set with great basket and bright design,"REALLY sweet tea set. Of all the tea sets I ordered for a gift for a 2 year old, this was the cutest and most substantial. the tea set is made of porcelain. not sure how wise that is for a 2 year old, but I think her mom and grandmom will being having the tea party with her, so she should be ok. Secondly, the basket is just so cute. The red and white checked napkins and table cloth are adorable. The set comes with spoons to stir the tea. Really thought it was a cute gift for this 2 year old girl. Tea cups are small -- a little smaller than espresso cups, but that should be ok for a 2 year old. the small tea pot can hold about 1/2 cup of beverage."
3,Cute but fragile,"This was purchased as a replacement for the same set without a basket. The first set lasted about a week before a couple of pieces broke. My 3-year-old loves her ladybug tea set, although it is extremely fragile. She has learned to be more careful with it, but our next tea set will be of a more durable material. The basket is cute but does nothing to protect the tea set."
4,Cute as a bug,This is a great tea set. It has plenty of pieces for young ones to imagine with and it feels like playing with real china and fancy flatware. The pieces are chunky making them less breakable in young hands. Having a storage basket for the set is nice although the handle on our basket is loose and needs to be attached better before it comes off completely.
3,Very Tiny Tea Set,This is definatly a miniture teas set. The silver wear is smaller then my first finger. If ym kids would play with this set I am sure it would brake the fisrt time they would use it. This set is half the size for normal play tea sets. There are some red stains on the set as thou some one touched it when they where not suppose to it will not come off. [...].
3,Broke after one day!,"It's a beautiful tea set and my 4 year daughter loves it! But unfortunately it broke just the next day. It is made very fragile and the handle to the basket popped right out. It isn't woven into the basket, which how it should have been made, rather it is glued to the side of the basket which now let loose!. We are attempting to fix it. I would like to send it back honestly, but my daughter still enjoys it, not really caring too much about the broken handle. She just keeps telling me ""Daddy, you will fix it?"" :-((("
3,Not as pictured,"The picture of the oval platter looks like it would be used for breads or rolls and shows it with a decorative holder. However, the actual platter is huge and does not have any hand painting in the center. The handpainting is around the edge with a solid center of white. This is a very deceiving picture. Don't order this if you think you want what the picture looks like."
2,Grossly Misrepresented,"Unfortunately, I didn't see the other feedback on this item. I concur with the other buyer. The item you receive is NOT the item pictured. I did find the dimensions in the description, but this is a HUGE platter, like for a whole ham or turkey, not for a typical main dish presentation. Hope they change the image."
3,Nacoa's Woman is SAD,"I liked this book a lot until I got to the end. I cannot believe how the author ends this book. I threw it down and walked away crying because I was so upset about the ending. If you DON'T want to cry, DON'T read this book. I guess the moral of this story is accept what is given to you, don't fight it...appreciate what you have when you have it."
5,Nakoa's Woman,"I absolutely loved this book. I also purchased Gladyce with a ""C"" as it was mentioned that it was a sequel to Nakoa's Woman. Who said this? This book had nothing to do with Nakoa's Woman. The only fault with this book was the ending. Who died/lived? If anyone else knows I would appreciate letting me know. I have read a lot of Native American Romance and this was beautiful."
5,Lives in my heart,"From the first time I read Nakoa's Woman at age 15 it has not ceased to live in my heart. The story is hauntingly beautiful, the characters are endearing and come alive to the reader. My whole family have read this book and have loved it as much as I have. I recommend it to anyone who loves to read, men and women alike. I look forward to reading the authors other books, of which I just became aware."
2,I hated Maria,I enjoyed a majority of this book. The events are realistic and the Native American traditions are well researched. I especially liked the fact that the author did not avoid the mystical aspect of Native American life. I found Nakoa to be very believable as well as most of the other characters in the story. The reason I gave this book a 2 is because by the end of the book I absolutely HATED Maria. She started out craving change and looking for adventure but by the end it didn't matter how much Nakoa tried to compromise for her it was never enough. I hated her and I hated the ending.
1,Inept Renditions of Classic Repertoire,"There are so many Great Classical Guitar Recordings by suchGreat guitarists as Segovia. Bream. Williams etc., that I wonderwhy anyone would waste the money or time listening to this one.While Russell has good technique, his meter/ timing is offmaking his interpretations hard to swallow to the trained ear. Inoticed this with other of his recordings as well. Everythingseems to blend together into one scherzo mess. He does notgive certain passages time to breath thus robbing them of theirbeauty. It takes more than skill to make music. It takes feelingmusicality, taste and talent!"
1,Bach,"Respectfuly David Russell is a very fine classical guitarist,however specially in music by Bach i expect more then just a good sound and nice frazing.His playing is too carefull and straight so that i had no patience to listen it for a more than few minutes.It might be a good material for students to check for wrong notes."
4,Maryannes Makeover,"i think "" Maryannes Makover"" was a GREAT book! i think that the BSC was just jealous of how maryanne was getting all the attention from other boys and the popular people. i was excited to see what was going to happen when that one girl spread the rumor around about... no i will just let u find out! i was really excited to see what was going to happen to Logan when her heard about the rumor"
4,Mary Anne's Makeover,"Mary Anne is tired of being the same old girl all the time. Her mom had passed away when she was young and ever since then her dad has been strict on everything Mary Anne wears, do, go, and so on. Then one day, when she was at the mall alone, she decided to have a makeover no matter anyone knows it or not! When her makeover was done she felt that she was soo beautiful but at the same time she felt guilty because she hadn't told anything to her friends and she was scared her dad will be mad at her.After she had gone over with her dad, she went to tell her friends. The problem was, her friends thought she had changed so much that her personality had changed too. The quiet and shy girl had changed to a outgoing and pretty girl! Everyone liked the new Mary Anne, except her friends. What was she going to do? She had got to show her friends that she can change into someone else if she wants to!!"
4,Go Mary Anne!,"I like this book a lot. Mary Anne decides to get her hair cut, and get some new clothes and makeup. She's starting to grow up, wanting to change her image and asking her strict dad to let her get a makeover. I thought Dawn and the other BSC members (except Mal and Jessi) were mean to Mary Anne. They were being jealous little brats, especially that evil Dawn. God, I can't stand her. I'm glad that Mary Anne finally confronted Dawn and the BSC about their witchy behavior, instead of avoiding them and hiding behind Logan. In the later books, Mary Anne becomes more assertive without sounding like a witch. It's great that she's coming out of her shy self. She is a very caring young lady who's dealt with a lot of tough issues. Mary Anne is a very strong girl, despite her shyness and sensitivity."
3,Give Me A Break!,"I couldn't believe it! Mary Anne needs to get some new friends, and that's all there is too it! I mean, please! I hated the way Dawn acted towards her, like a total brat! Eavesdropping, acting cold and unfriendly. Dawn missed her dad so she took it out on Mary Anne, basically. Real mature! Then she gets the other BSC-ers to give her the cold shoulder--first of all, if She and Dawn were fighting, the others need to MIND THEIR OWN STINKIN' BUSINESS! What a bunch of babies. Another thing, MARY ANNE DID NOTHING WRONG, SO WHY SHOULD SHE APOLOGIZE TO DAWN? IT WAS DAWN'S DOING!"
3,Very unrealistic.,"I thought this book was good because it was fun to read about Mary Anne's makeover, since that stuff always interests me. But the reason i gave it 3 stars was because it made me so mad! Her friends, who I always thought were so cool, were the biggest jerks alive! I mean, what kind of people would spread rumors about you and then be the biggest jerk alive to your face, just because THEY DIDN'T LIKE YOUR HAIR? Luckily, this is the only book I have ever read in this series where the BSC acts this immature for something so stupid. Mary Anne needs to get some new friends!"
2,I got a bum unit,"The thing's built like a tank, except ... for the inside, I guess. I hooked mine up and found that if the cord going in was bumped the wrong way, a bunch of the power sockets would lose power. Then I would have to wiggle it to get it to come on again.As long as I don't touch it it works fine. I just leave it behind the entertainment center anyway, so it's fine day-to-day, but be forewarned."
3,Only 1-line protection,"Even though the box I received says ""2 line protection"" on the front and back, APC support says that box has a mistake and only the primary line is protected. I'm returning it for a different model."
5,Finally on CD!!,"I'm glad to see that they FINALLY released the song ""Teach Me Tonight (Me Gusta Tu Baile)"" on CD.It's a great Latin beat song with a strong soul Diva's voice that only Patti can sing. One of her best."
1,Substitute item,"I did not receive the item I ordered because it has been discontinued. I received another item that was supposed to take its place. Because I ordered this for someone else, they were uneasy about using the substitute item. I returned the item unused."
4,Conversations with Bruce Robinson,"Very enjoyable series of conversations with actor turned writer turned director, pretty boy Bruce Robinson. Having directed two of the best English comedies of the 80's (Withnail and I and How To Get Ahead in Advertising - both starring Richard E Grant - for another perspective and a fantastic perspective of an English (from Swaziland actually but...) actor in Hollywood read Richard E Grant's Withnails) I was very eager to read about the making of these films and what has happened to his career since - try sitting through Jennifer 8 without being disappointed. He is a voracious reader and collector and it is great to get a glimpse of his life and work. I only wish his body of creative work was larger - many of his more recent projects have fallen through. For fans of these two great films it is a delight."
1,Not What I expected,"I guess I was expecting more. . . . Like a comic or an adventure, or something. The title and description made it seem FAR better than it was. I would have returned it if it was possible. Don't waste the money or time. Can I give it less than one star?"
2,Liked the Book.,This was a pretty good book. I read the 1st 6 pages thanks to Amazon.com and bought it because of what I read and the explosive beginning. But the book fell down and let me down a little. I'd really like to read about careers that Black women have other than being hair stylists.
3,Typical Ghetto Book,"The only reason I finished this book is because it was short. There didn't seem to be any plot or climax, it was just a story. Celeste (who is the mistress of a drug dealer) owns an salon and constantly allows unprofessional behavior between the hairstylists. I didn't see anything really exciting or attention-getting in this book. It was just an average ghetto story."
4,DIME PIECES OR HATERS,"IT WAS A GOOD READ AND EASY READ! IT TOOK ME ONE DAY TO READ IT! THE STORY PUT EMPHASIS ON THE KEPT WOMAN(CHICK ON THE SIDE), INSTEAD OF THE WIFE WHICH WAS A GOOD TWIST. I ENJOYED THE CHARACTER ISHMAEL THE MOST. I COULD SEE HOW ALL THE WOMEN AT DIME PIECE COULD FALL FOR HIM. THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF DEPTH IN THE STORY BUT A GOOD READ."
1,Dime Piece was awful!!!,This book was so wack..I wouldn't waste my time if I was you..I never read something so dry and so meaningless in my life
3,Ok Book,This book was ok. The salon has so much drama and fighting over this one guy and after a while it gets a little old but that real life issues.
2,Not Up To Par,This book was ok. Through out the whole thing all of the workers at the salon are just fighting over this one guy and after a while it gets old and you lose whatever focus you had for the book ar first. Better sub-plots less Involving this guy would have enhanced the book
3,Dime Piece,"The girls that work in the beauty salon called ""Dime Piece"" have a lot of envy and jealousy between them. So much so that drama has erupted quite a few times causing their customers to be spectators to their verbal and physical fights.You all know you can get the latest gossip from your hair stylist, but these girls take it to the another level!!I enjoyed the story and it was comical at times. I am looking forward to reading more of this authors works."
2,The title of this book should have been ISHMAEL!!!,"I am SOOO glad I finished this book! Let me be honest with you, I almost put it down several times but I tried my best to hang in there with it. The storyline was not well developed and neither were the characters. I didn't feel like I knew any of them! This book was a little on the boring side and I kept wondering when something was going to pop off..it never did! The entire book was full of a bunch of nothing then toward the end a lot was crammed in but to me there was still no climax to the story. I mean come on, Ishmael wasn't really ALL THAT for the whole book & everything in it to center around him! This was the first book I've read by this author but I'm still willing to give her another try. I just hope this wasn't her best work."
5,A Great Read,"I really enjoyed reading ""Dime Piece"". This book has soooo much drama, it's crazy! Charly is a mess! And Ishmael is such a dog. For anyone who has spent time in a hair salon, this book is definitely on point. I highly recommend reading it."
3,Rushed ending-not too excited about the sequel.,"I love Tracy Brown, but this wasn't one of her best works. Characters and plot seemed a little underdeveloped, but it kept you interested enough. When you read a book like White Lines, you come to expect a lot, where Tracy Brown did not leave out any details. I hope the sequel is better!"
2,Not her Best Work,"I felt Tracy Brown did okay with this novel. It was a mediocre read. At times I felt there was no originality in the story line or even with the characters, the development of the project was under expectations. Honestly it was a ""been there done that"" type of novel. It was slow and in the beginning I wondered was there ever going to be a plot. Tracy Brown is a phenomenal author; she proved that with the novel ""White Lines"". But Dime piece most definitely dropped the ball at being a classic and long lasting novel."
5,Delivers as Promised,"Fifteen years ago, I heard a friend play a song from this book. ""Moaning,"" I think it was. ""Whoa,"" I said, ""you gotta teach me that!"" He handed me this book, and ten minutes later I was playing it. That's no reflection on me because (trust me) I was and still am a mediocre piano player. My favorite is the last song in the book, ""Worried Man Blues."" Took me a while to get it down, but it's beautiful. If you're a real musician, this book probably won't do the job. But if you're an amateur like me, if you can read music, count time, and play a bit more than chords with your left hand, then you'll be able to play the songs in this book. I wish my piano teacher had given me this book. I might have practiced."
2,Old,"I get this every year for my wife for Christmas. This year I thought I would try another vendor (since I was already making purchases on Amazon). The shipment arrived promptly and was exactly what I ordered.Except...When my wife opened the bottles on Christmas morning, the oil had fermented. It smelled of mildew.I returned the order and was credited quickly. The company that sold the product was fast and kind. I just wish the oil was fresh."
4,Good value,"These boxes are nice looking, if you are using them where they will be seen. If not, other options might be better. They are acid-free, but not archival quality. Archival storage costs a fortune, so these are an inexpensive alternative. The stationery boxes are very light weight - almost flimsy - but I'm not storing anything heavy in them. They are working well for my purpose; sorting and storing family history documents. I also got the nutmeg color and the graphite, so that the stacks didn't look so boring.BTW - you can make most any box archival by lining it with aluminum foil. The foil creates an effective barrier against migration. Then, if padding is needed, use either acid free paper or tissue. Or use 100% cotton muslin or old 100% cotton sheets washed in plain detergent (no fabric softener, fragrance or bleach). 100% undyed washed polyester fabric is also inert."
3,Not Real Simple's Best,"I have been subscribing to Real Simple for a few years and was disappointed that the recipes and tips weren't among their best. The ""meals"" weren't well balanced either; not enough vegetables or fruits included. I suppose you should serve a side salad with many of the main courses in order to complete (and lighten) the meal. I would not recommend this book for experienced cooks or dieters (ground beef and french fry casserole?). I do recommend the magazine for better recipes, balance, and clever tips."
5,Real Simple: Meals Made Easy,I had high expectations from this cookbook since I love the magazine so much and my time has become so limited for cooking. The recipes I've tried have been very quick and easy to make and have been great! The illustrations are gorgeous.
3,Good choice,I really like this book because the recipes are actually good and the book itself is heavy and large.
5,"What a cookbook should be: clear, concise, with lots of wonderful pictures","As a novice chef, I found the book to be exactly what I need: relatively easy recipes that taste more difficult than they look. I'd recommend it at least to anyone of a beginning to intermediate skill-level. A special hat tip to the photo-editors/photographers; if only my own dishes could come out looking so good!"
5,Real Simple cookbook,"Inventive recipes that are so quick and easy. Book includes lovely photos of every dish, which is nice to see before you prepare it. Great gift for a friend."
3,"I give it a rousing ""OK"", and a word of caution","The layout of the book is fine. The photographs of the completed dishes are fine. The selection is a bit fish-heavy for my taste. To be honest, I've only made one thing in this book: macaroni and cheese. I should have realized something was amiss when the recipe called for six (6) cups of milk. I stopped at five, and the end result was macaroni and milk soup, albeit with a crunchy topping. If that's a typo, it's a biggie, and it makes me wonder about the validity of the rest of the recipes."
3,Good but not as good as the newer Real Simple cookbook.,"I am a real simple addict. This is mainly because the recipes from the magazine and the realsimple.com are healthy, easy to make, and always call for fresh ingredients.Cons: Although this book has some wonderful staples, the recipes are not nearly as healthy as the second cookbook, ""Easy, delicous meals."" Not to mention, there is not a calorie listing in this cookbook which makes it difficult for those of us who are trying to be concious of healthy cooking.Pros: Delicous recipes. The book is also separated into great categories, my favorite being "" no shop meals.""Overall, a good cook book that I will use and I would recommend adding to your cookbook collection."
5,Loved this book!,I have made several recipes from this book and they all turned out great. Easy to follow instructions and a cute little ribbon bookmark!
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I purchased this item with reasonable expectations. I wanted it to move forward and backward and be able to drive along my blacktop driveway and maybe even my grass a little. It barely moves. My daughter is an average size 3 year old so she is not weighting it down. Its main issue is teh battery. It takes 18-30 hours to charge - that's a minimum of a day and a half, yet if you get 30 minutes of drive time you are lucky. and even then, it moves so slowly its a crawl - hardly the 2.5 MPH promised, forget 5MPH.Also, the plastic is rather thin so I doubt it will hold up to any inadvertant taps.Think twice about this - it might be cute but it doesn't move worth a shoot!"
1,Beware......,"Toys R Us recommend you buy a 12 volt battery and 12 volt system battery charger with this great bcar ""Do you want to include this with your item?"". Unfortunately what they did'nt know is that this charger does not charge the battery! Having kindly brought this to their attention they told me they would rectify the problem for everyone else but sorry can't help you!....unfortunately I live in the Turks and Caicos Islands and shipped this to a freight forwarder....their Customer services Manager told me to buy another one and hung up the telephone on me.........Its now 9 days to Christmas Day and I have a car and battery over $ in value that I can't getworking....oh actually my total order was over $ and included a patioplayhouse as well.....I call that misleading information from the Toy experts(not their fault of course) and basic Corporate irresponsibility....so beware of the great Customer Service you get here and do all your own research on expensive Toys!"
4,movement,"a wonderful toy and kids love it howerver, it do not run well ongrass with light weight kids age 3-5, the wheels spins, work well with heavier kids age 3-5 years"
4,Purchased for my twin daughters 3rd birthday!,"We purchased the Barbie Jeep for our twin daughters 3rd birthday. I thought at first it was too advanced for them but this Jeep is easy to handle and wonderful for a 3 year old. They loved sitting side by side and taking turns driving. They caught on real quick on the reverse and understood the 'gas pedal' and steering. They also loved the radio! Great value with the rebate from Toys R Us. The only drawback is the Jeep is made light and of plastic that outside driving in the grass the 'plastic' tires spin. Also, would like to see a more durable bumper on the back. All in all, a nice battery operated toy for a 3 year old, especially twins!"
4,Barbie Jeep,My daughter got her Barbie Jeep for Christmas and the battery will no longer hold charge. She has enjoyed the music that came along with the Jeep more than the Jeep itself.
4,"GREAT TUNES, GREAT TIMES","Our Jeep has lasted for 2 years and still going strong! Like a true Jeep, it goes on concrete, grass and even up our hills. Tires spin when grass is wet, but that makes the downhill ride more fun! The summers have been filled with the catchy tunes from the included radio and that comforting motor noise drowned out by the childrens laughter and games. The rear ""cargo"" area (just behind the seat) is often brimming with freshly picked flowers, rocks, sticks, etc. Washes up nicely with soap & water. Battery lasts roughly 4 hours of constant driving. Interesting how children emulate drivers, makeup games and obstacle courses. When we needed a replacement part, it was received within a few days and was easy to install. Great product!"
2,Disappointed,"I play videogames a lot but this expansion pack doesn't really push my swing. The game looks good but not good enough for me. I been playing Diablo 2 for a year already and that game is fun. I play a lot of video games, and that's all I spend my money on. I hate going to malls except when there's a babbages or EB there cause there's too many people that are pretty there so I get scared. That's why I like guys."
3,Too hard.... ;-(,"Roller Coaster Tycoon was pretty fun for a while when I enjoyed it. Now I really don't play it. Whatever, Loopy landscapes has more ""stuffs"" you can put in to the game, and has a lot of new maps. But the missions are VERY hard as you beat many missions. Some are even IMPOSSIBLE!!"
4,THIS GAME WAS AWSOME,i had fun on this game but i could not rate it a 3 3 is to low and 5 i didn't want to rate it if you haven't got this game you better hurry
1,This Is not what you think it is,"I bought this game along with Roller Coaster Tycoon, Zoo Tycoon, Ski Resort Tycoon, and Fast Food Tycoon. I loaded all the games on my computer. I could play all the games except Roller Coaster Tycoon Loopy Landscapes. I tried uninstalling the other games, but it didn't work. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME WITH THE OTHER TYCOON GAMES. EITHER ONLY BUY ONE, OR DO NOT BUY AT ALL!!!"
5,I don't need to play this one...,"I have RCT, and RCT:CF (RCT= Roller coaster tycoon). This one is gonna be the same thing as add on number one (Corkscrew Follies) meaning you will need RCT, but for this one you'll also need CF for it to work.Well Loopy Landscapes should have more themes for your park, a new roller coaster or two and you'll be able to do more stuff with the ground. The example I got was the fact you'll have cliffs now. I got this info from an interview with Chris Sawyer himself from the web page RCT UK (I think, anyway...).I Hope there will be more music and theme s to go with the music (Like they had a Chinese song for your ride but no Chinese music =( ) But like I said it should have many more themes and make your park a lot prettier. It's gonna be a smart buy if you are a big fan or RCT."
1,whats up with this,"I really really want this game ,but why the heck do I need to buy corkscrew follies agian?? I think thats VERY iggnorant!!"
1,It is Garbage,It is Garbage for that to create a park of amusements like that not and separate this so expensive one that somebody crazy to that I would buy it I don't buy it
4,Great game!,"Roller Coaster Tycoon: Loopy Landscapes is a great game, yet it lacks a few things. First, it hasn't added many new rides. Also, you can't charge admission to the park in the normal scenarios, which is where most of the income comes from. On the other hand, it does add tons of new shops and stalls, and it adds 30 new scenarios, most of them having unique goals, such as: ""Have a monthly ride income of at least $8,000."" Hence the name, Loopy Landscapes has added six new exciting themes, like a Winter theme or a Creepy theme. Loopy Landscapes gives three actual parks that you can control. Alton Towers is one of them. Overall, I really like Loopy Landscapes, though it does lack a few things. I would recommend this game to anyone who has some Roller Coaster Tycoon experience."
5,RCT: Latest Add-On,"Although I have'nt yet had the opportunity to play this add-on, I imagine it will be just as great as the 2nd, Corkscrew Follies. I wanted to write this review prior to playing the game, to talk to those of you disgruntled about the inclusion of Corkscrew Follies. Hasbro is offering a $10 rebate to Corkscrew Follies owners. If you send them your old CD-Rom, they will send you $10 back to help compensate for the price. You can find the info on this at Rollercoaster Tycoons' offical website.....www.rollercoastertycoon.com...Those of you who don't care, buy this....the new themeing and entrance and exit features will be worth it alone!!"
4,Roller Coaster Tycoon Expansion Pack,"This is a good extension to the Roller Coaster Tycoon game. Although it does not explicitly say it will work with Windows XP, my son has had no trouble running it on our PC which is running Windows XP Home Edition. Make sure you install Roller Coaster Tycoon game before you install Roller Coaster TycoonExpansion Pack: Loopy Landscapes."
5,Great expansion to RCT - and more coasters!,"This expansion to Roller Coaster Tycoon (you must already have installed a copy of that game) includes the ""Corkscrew Follies"" expansion as well. There are many new challenging scenarios - including many coaster ""finishing"" parks. There are new park themes and themed ride entrances. There are whole new shops - including the long-awaited ""T-Shirt Shop"". There are a few new rides - including the ""Enterprise"".But the best feature of this expansion is the fact that the ""Corkscrew Follies"" expansion is also included for free! This is =another= 30 more scenarios, a bunch of new ride enhancements, and many customizing details. If you've always wondered what it would be like to own an amusement park, you will get many hours of fun out of this expansion.If you have Roller Coaster Tycoon, (and if you don't - go get one!) and you haven't got ""Corkscrew Follies"" then you'll love this great double sized addition to that game."
4,Roller coaster rampage,Roller coaster tycoon is one of the best games on my (awful) computer. I got it for my birthday and I think My favorite park is Vertigo views (Ilike the already built coaster) and besides it's a good park.I am not a cheater and I am glad because cheating is no fun.I like everything about loopy landscapes. I forgot my favorite coaster but I'll try to remember.The buildings and scenery are great to and I like the new pathways and martian themeing objects and I just realized how to make four looper. From chris
4,"Lacking in Some Places, But Still Very Good","An expansion pack from the original RTC (Roller Coaster Tycoon) this game is well put together. You can do many more things in it. It comes with a few new rides and many new levels. Plus it has Corkscrew Follies on it too! With Corkscrew Follies on it makes it all the better (unless you purcased it before). Basicly it refreshes a game which you may have gotten bored of and adds new options to chose from. One thing thay are lacking though is more freedom to build your own rides from scrach without as many boundries. Overall though, it's very good!"
2,Soldering Melted AHAHAHA CHEAP!,"The overheat protection on this product is garbage. It will shut off in 25 minutes unless its like below 60 degrees outside. I fried this amp in a months time cause its made so cheap. Recently took it apart and soldered it real nice now it works again, but this not as well as the 1000w kenwood I had. This makes my music sound muffled but you get what you pay for. Id never recommend or buy this brand again it's cheap trash."
3,THUMPS BUT IS NOT 1000 WATTS!!!,"OK, HERES THE DEAL. I HAVE THIS AMP HOOKED UP WITH DUAL 10IN PYLE CHOPPER SERIES WOOFERS THAT ARE 1000 WATTS.. ( 500 WATTS A PIECE). AND I HAVE A PAIR OF ROCKFORD FOSGATE 3 WAYS IN THE FRONT DOORS ( NOT THROUGH MY AMP_) IT THUMPS MAN!!!I ACTUALLY HAD A SHERIFF TELL ME TO TONE DOWN THE VOLUME AS I HAD AN OLD SCHOOL NEW YORK MIX THUMPING !!! LOL...THE NEGATIVE THING ABOUT THIS AMP IS THAT I DONT FEEL ITS 1000 WATTS. IF I HAD TO GUESS ITS PROBABLY PUMPING OUT 100-150 OR LESS WATTS RMS PER CHANNEL BRIDGEDBUT I DEFIANTLY RECCOMEND THIS AMP FOR THE PRICE!! NO DOUBT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,PLEASE DO NOT BUY,"Did not work out of the box... Hooked everything up, got a 12 volt reading from the leads on my multimeter but the POS amp did not work."
2,its started good then took a sh*t,i ordered this item a while back and forgot my username and password to my account and now i found it i just wanted to let people no i used the amp for about 3 weeks tops and then it went into protect mode out of no where it never overheated nothing was wrong it just died out of no where. i checked all the wires and everything was done wright. i dont advise buying this amp spen a few extra dollars and get a name brand amp.
1,BROKEN/ DOA,"Came in, i installed it correctly, i know it was b/c ive had another amp hooked up with the same wires for a year with no probs, worked for about 2 hours, i used it to power 2 12inch JL subs, it worked great wile it did! excellent sound. but ill never buy another pyramid product again, i returned this item."
1,it worked for 5 minutes,I spent alot of time putting this in and it sounded great for five minutes then it stopped putting out to the speakers. Has power and input.that's it.lets see how the return policy is.
4,Amp review,This amplifier does the job. I have it hooked up in my EM2 ( 03 honda civic ex) and i'm powering my single dxi 12 inch sub and it pounds. I bump Crime City Entertainment music in it all the time. These guys have some bangin music on youtube i found and i wanted to hear the base so ofcouse i bought the perfect amp to do the job. Very good amp
1,worst amp,"looks to good to be true right? well its true. i got this amp in the mail 2 days later, and there were screws missing, and gave no audio output to my sub what so ever. i will never get anything from this seller again."
3,"It's great for $40. But, .... If you want true DEEP bass it is not the way to go if you pushing subs bigger the 10""s.","I got it in the mail today. Look great. The connections are too small. i could barley plug my 12v and ground into it. I am pushing 2 sony xplode 12""s and it bangs but the bass is just loud. you really don't feel it like you should with a true 1000 watt amp. The bass islo is not clean with this amp. I am broke and this was all i could afford so i am happy but will be upgrading after the xmas holiday. I f u want deep bass look elsewhere. Now, on the other hand, if you are using this for mids and highs then it will do everything and more . happy hunting"
1,do not buy,no not buy this amp its not worth it my sister got it and it already gave out she only had it for a day pyramid stuff sucks!!!
3,Not A Bad Deal,"I got the Pyramid PB717x to use on 1 Hifonic 600 watt sub. it seems to be doing a great job pushing out the bass.I wired the sub for 2ohm,and brigded the amp to mono,and it's holding up well. not a bad deal fo rthe price."
3,Not a 1000watt amp,Power should be rated at true RMS rating. Still If you don't overpower the power supply this amp will give a good bass response in a small car with distortion coming only when you over drive with too much input. Keep the input adjusted and unit performs well.
3,Ok i guess,Nice amp came in original box with fedex lable slapped on it. Not wrapped just taped. It works fine but doesnt hit like 1000 watts so if you want the punch like i was looking for you might want to get a 2000 watt instead
2,Issues after about a month,"I ordered this item on October 9th (about a month ago) and used it with my 2 12 inch mtx terminators, it worked completely fine until yesterday, it suddenly stopped working.... i turned my car on the next morning and it started working again for maybe two minutes and shut off and still isn't working... Until this, i would have recommended this amp to anyone, its a cheap amp though so i guess you cant expect it to work for too long, definitely replacing this with a more expensive amps from a different brand in hopes that it will actually last."
1,piece of crap,"this played all of 15 seconds then nothing I thought it blew my sub but it wasthe amp itself. I've never seen any thing like that & I was a audio tech for 5 years this one is one to stay away from.Now I have to wait to order another""thanks for nothing"" amp."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS AMP,"This so called ""1000 Watt"" amp is huge piece of junk. You can tell how powerful an amp is by looking at the fuse on it and seeing how much power it can actually put through. This amp could barely power 1 10"" sub, and the max power at 4 ohms is actually about 50 Watts. Don't be fooled by sneaky manufacturers who lie about the capabilities of amps!"
2,Not enough power,"There is not enough power in this amp, even tho it says 1000 watt it is not producing it to at 1200 watt dual sub."
1,Overheating monster,I have to turn of my cd player every 5 minutes to prevent amp from over heating even with subs all the way down. Real cheap amp avoid at all costs
4,Amp,"I put this amp on two ten inch kickers and they beat ....but it also counts on what kinda cd player u have too ... , but the amps pretty good no complaints !!!!!"
1,what bump where?,"Uh, I bought this about 2 days ago. Very happy about the shipping, got here super fast. However, I'm pretty sure my 250 watt mono amp hits so much harder then this. I'm actually 90% sure i'll end up returning this shit. Easy set up, but I might just get my money back, and put a little more for a bit better."
3,For the Price....,"A good product or the price, I had to order a replacement amp when the first one just started shorting out fuses on me, I was running the amp for a month, with no issues, when it gave up on me, luckily the price isnt too high and was able to buy a replacement, If this amp expires on me as well, i will not re-order this brand again."
2,Not What I expected!!,I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's better to spend a little more and get some better quality.
1,Doesnt work,"I got the amp and i give the only star for delivery speed. very fast. i hooked it up and nothing happened. double checked, triple checked etc. nothing. its a cheap amp. not innexpesive. cheap"
3,Pyramid Amp Good For Basic Use,"This Amplifier is an older piece of equipment, when I took it to an Audio Professional, first thing he said was ""Wow, this thing is pretty old"". I wasn't aware of this when I purchased it. But your paying for what you see. Its 1000 watts, and can handle your smaller speakers and a subwoofer. Thats about it. I was told to NOT install anything else or it might blow the Amplifier. All in all, its a decent product and I wouldn't recommend it anybody. Pay 50-70$ more for a lot better quality and more reliable product. Hope this helps"
2,good for a month,when i first got this amp it worked pretty good but i felt like it didnt have enough power at all and took alot of adjusting and boosting with my sterio deck to get it to actually boom good. but the problem is that i have only had it for a month and it just died. iv changed the fuse and made sure the subs still work. iv contacted the company and so far they havnt contacted back. i should have listened to the other reviews that talked about how the amps died out quickly. just pay the extra money and get a good more powerful amp
3,cheap,it sounds great on the low bass has problems with high bass i would buy agian it is cheap but it gets the job done
3,ok for certain stuff,"I wouldnt recommend this amp for any subwoofers or anything big, its peak maybe be 500 watts but its rms is only 75 for 2 ohm, 50 for 4ohm. If you buy this i would recommend using if for a stereo or maybe an 8inch sub. I personally bought it and didnt read the specs on it and when i got it i was shocked and the low rms. definatly not enough to power my 2 10"" 1000 watt peak subs, so i returned it. Other than that, its heavy and big so if u plan on hiding it under a seat, u might want to change those plans right now."
5,Beasty,Great amp for the price..Have it hooked up to a pyramid cap pushing a sony dvc and a fosgate p2 12...Rattles my mirrors and trunk verywell..Its a beast!
4,"Good, but overheats occasionally","This amp is great for what I paid for it, but it does tend to overheat sometimes. I have it hooked up to my 12"" MTX Terminators, and they really pound hard. It impresses all of my friends at school, and sounds good overall too."
2,(-_-),"I ordered this product, but unfortunately it kept blowing the fuse in my car, when i changed the fuse, the amp wouldnt work.... :( but it did arrive as expected, in a timely manner"
1,Dont be fooled.....,This amp sucks. Dont be fooled where it says 1000 watt.... Not even close. Im guessing you get 150 watts rms whiled bridged.
1,Are we ready? No your amp is broken.,"I got this amp to push my dual 12inch terminators. Everything was great, I was already to be blown away by my bass but then my amp didn't work. We tried everything to make it work. I finally sent it back and put an extra $70 into a new amp. Hopefully Hifonics makes a better amp. Luckily they took it back no problem."
1,over heated and just stoped working,i got it at frist it was nice tell i drove about 20 miles lissaning to the music when it just shut off. at first i thought it was nothing. i tried every thong i moved it i put a fan on it nothing worked. i keep using after a week it died would not turn on. it is a peace of crap dont buy it. im not one to write bad reviews but this was bad.
1,"Pyramid PB717X 1,000-Watt 2-Channel Bridgeable Amplifier",THIS PRODUCT WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY LIKE REALLY NO WONDER WHY IT WAS SO CHEAP AND IT WAS TAKING MY COUSIN SO LONG TO FIX MY SYSTEM B/C THE AMP SOUND FOR THE SUBS TO PLAY DIDNT EVEN WORK AND THAT WAS MY FIRST TIME USING THE AMP BUT WHOEVER MADE EM AND WHOEVER SELLING IT THEY LUCKY THIS TIME B/C I SHOULD RAISE HELL BUT ITS ALL GOOD IM NOT GONE EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT IT WAS JUST OF WASTE OF MY TIME AND EFFORT BUT ILL KNOW NEXT TIME
5,TRUST MEE!!!!,I rated this five stars so everyone would be able to see this review. DONT BUY THIS AMP. It is marketed as 1000 watts and it only puts out 50! It overheats if you use it for more than 20 minutes. Overall it is cheap and flimsy. Don't cheap out and buy this amp thinking it will produce any good use.
1,WOW,well i got this amp a week ago and alll i can say is wow im running it in my room and i redid my power supply and now when i hook it up it shorts my power supply out at first i thought it was my power supply so i got another one and wow guess what it was the amp alll i can say is wow my amp wont turn on cuz in my opinion the + and - connect some how and the remote works fine and the- is but when the + goes on it shorts out i hope i can get a new one
2,HORRIBLE,please dont waste you money on this piece of crap. 1000 watts my ass! This only hits about 300 watts. The only good thing about this amp is that its light and fits anywhere
4,GREAT UNIT,Plugged this thing in and turned it on. Crystal clear amazing sound from the get go. I love this thing
3,Just not as described,"I installed this amp after carefuly reading the instructions and going out and buying the right size wire install kit. It bumps, Just not 1000 watts bump. I have it all the way up and still no solid bump. Its fine if you have nothing else. I personally would not buy this item again."
2,"Shipped a generic brand, not a Eureka product as depicted","The listing has a picture of the Eureka brand product with the Eureka product number and the Product Features states ""Genuine Eureka Part"", but they shipped bags manufactured by EnviroCare Technologies. In some of their other listings depicting EnviroCare Technologies brand products they refer to them as ""generic"". It may be that these generic bags perform as well as the genuine Eureka bags, but it is deceptive to advertise one product and ship something else."
5,Well Worth Reading,"If you're already a fan of Jerry Garcia, this book isquite rewarding, entertaining & even enlightening.The interview really helps you ""get to know"" Jerry,where many of his motivations root & bloom--- The""stoned Sunday rap"" should bring a smile to many faces...you can CLEARLY read that these people are STONED...and some of the subjects they talk about are indeedenlightening. The interview took place around 1972,when all of Jerry's powers were extremely strong andenergetic...before any ""touch of grey"" kicked in.This book is no fluff entertainment piece of crap,but really has substance."
4,History and Social Worths,"My book has been received in fine condition. Garcia is one of the most accurate and fair participants in an admittedly renaissance culture. Good luck with contextual understandings (have you ever seen an old political joke funny if you didn't know that history?). My history library is smiling-thanxs!I also recommend Mr. Garcia's film and book on the ""Deadheads."" The film is set at Winterland Auditorium in the 70's (not the 90's film; altho that work is fair to standard reflections of power and society). The deadhead book is a grand presentation of illustrations and paragraphical delight reflecting a cultural introduction to the fairness of our hippydum that has ""saved the world."""
3,real music,the hentchmen are from another planet.three kids for detroit who probley grew up surrounded by house music and rap yet they go the complete opposite.they dont belong here in 2003.they should be sent back where they came from.1962.but i guess they can stay
1,Battery ships without acid,"First battery I purchased in 30 years that did not come with acid. I called and it is only $2, but add $6 for shipping. Ridiculus.Buyer beware, it should be in BOLD that the acid does not ship.Very disappointed."
3,NASB Bible (Received 3/07/12),"I bought it 3/05/12 and I was really looking forward to its arrival at my house. Unfortunately, upon opening it, the bookmark (the one that comes with most Bibles) came off already! And I can guarantee that I didn't pull it off either. In addition, I'm not sure if it was always Printed In China, but it is now and so it's not sewn binding (I think it might actually be glue...). And if it matters to you, the leather is good and it feels nice in the hands. But in light of the detached bookmark and the poor binding, I would not have purchased this Bible. I wanted to use this Bible long term, but I don't think it will last."
5,Excellent!,"The print is just the right size, large print, easy on the eyes but not so big that is embarrassing for others to see. Love the reference scriptures along the sides."
5,Good is Very Good to Me,"I am very happy with this Bible. The larger print is very helpful and the side references are thorough. I like them on the side instead of in the middle. I wanted a Bible without a lot of study guide material and this one does not have all that. Because I wanted the larger print the Bible is plenty big without all the added stuff. The paper is of a quality that the pages do not stick together. I ordered it as a used item and could hardly notice the wear on the box that was described. It had a strange odor at first, but after leaving it out of the box and ruffling the pages for a few days, the odor went away. It came at a great savings to me as it was advertised as being in ""good"" condition. Good condition was much better than I expected."
4,Very fine nasb bible,"The bible i bought is of fine quality. Nice for its price! Shipping was fast, communication clear."
1,NASB Update Side-Column Reference; Black Genuine Leather by The Lockman Foundation.,"To be very honest, This bible's printing is normal( just ok! ) but not as good enough as like the one whom printed in THE USA one..The bounding is good, But only very bad in the leather's quality( Although it claim was made by Genuine leather ) to be very honestly, I used to bough a lot of bible from different publishers But this one is The bad :( WHY it was make me so disappointed about the quality!"
2,Falling Apart in Less than 2 Yrs,"I purchased this Bible less than 2 years ago and my wife purchased one shortly after I did. Both Bibles are already starting to fall apart. Sections of the Bible are starting to loosen from the binding. The cloth binding material is pulling away from bound pages and I can see that before long the Bible will become useless. The same thing is happening to my wife's Bible and she uses it less than I do my own.I am a pastor and I bought this Bible to use as my new study and preaching Bible. I have already invested great time and energy into making this Bible special. I use it daily and it already has several notations in the text and margins. My Bible is the most precious possession I own. I do not treat my Bibles poorly. I had high expectations of this Bible, but it now seems apparent to me that it is of inferior quality to my old NASB which after 15 years the binding is in better tact than this one."
2,Major dissappointment,This bible although cosmetically nice didn't open well. The pages were severely wrinkled at the binding that some of the text was obscured. It was so wrinkled I got all the minor prophets to stand at a 45 degree angle when the book was opened.Perhaps I got a lemon. I didn't feel up to trying again. I hope you have a better experience.Amazon was great with a no hassle return and the NASB is a great translation... perhaps the best English version.
5,It's a great Bible,"I'm very happy with it. It is very well put together. Best of all, it is the word of God."
1,All pages wrinkled!!!! It's going back ASAP.,"I tried to find this bible locally because of the previous reports of ""page gutter wrinkles"", ""pages are all wrinkled at the binding"" and ""severely wrinkled at the binding"". Nothing was available locally to view. So, I decided to take a chance ordering through Amazon and I got burned. Every single page at the binding is wrinkled. I paid $33 for a bible that retails for $50. I wouldn't have paid $5 for this poorly made product. Even my kids' $10 bibles are higher quality than this one. It's going to be returned to Amazon ASAP. I'm done with Foundation Publications and will no longer be buying their products based on their inattention to quality control (China?). By the way, I'm not a China-basher. My adopted daughter is Chinese."
3,Gutter crinkle,"Nice book, but the page ""gutter"" wrinkles when the Bible is opened.I ordered 2 of these for my grandsons & they both have the problem. I was not aware of this flaw until I had written their names in the front & they were looking at the books. Had I noticed the flaw, I would have returned the books & obtained other gifts for my grandsons."
1,Buyers Beware!,"Learn from my mistake. I didn't listen to the previous customer who purchased this Bible and noted the warped & wrinkled pages, and I paid the price. I just received the book to find the exact same problem--the pages are all wrinkled at the binding, preventing the pages to lie flat and making this Bible look awful. The pages appear to be cheaply made, on top of the wrinkling. I would pass on buying this Bible until Amazon fixes the problem with the manufacturer/distributor. Stay Away.Returned product immediately for refund."
2,Too hard for students,"When I purchased this book, I was planning on using it with my first grade students and show them the writing process in a fun way. The book is very wordy and very hard to follow for little kids."
2,Too distracting,"I already had several books regarding this theme, and this one is definitively not kids friendly. It didn't do anything for me and the black and white graphics are too busy and too distracting for my child to get involved in it. I bought it because it was on the reference page of another book I had."
5,shenmue 2 rocks,this game is awsome its even better than the first one its still have realastic graphics and xbox makes it look better...the game has so many things to do u just want to play it over and over again..i bought this game over seas and even though its in a diffrent language it still says words in english. This game (in my oppinion) can almost match with Halo. the only hard part is deffeating the boss at the end of the game even if u never had trouble with and other people u faught this guy is tuff.. all in all this game should be number 1!
5,SHENMUE 2,"This is my first RPG I played and rented and this kept me hooked with the storyline. This isn't very linier because if you mess up on an important job you'll do something different. Once I had to meet the boss to find out about RYO'S father and I had to fight a gang of thugs and I failed because wave after wave of them beat the crap out of me. Then I was healed and I met a gang and I had to ow em 400....There's loads to do, fight with diferent moves, arm restle, play darts, spar with someone, do jobs and many more and most of those listed above is to earn money."
5,"Shenmue 2 not an improve,but still good!","First of all this game is so unique and good. Its basicly the same as the one on Dreamcast,but its very good game. Ok if you havent played 1 then you'll be lost. But don't worry,it has a movie and a short movie that will show you everything. It follows Ryo on his quest to Hong Hong. The gameplay is combined in many way. To mystery solving, Virtual Fighter Fightin,button sequences, an to mashing button action. It mostly feature in fighting style though. If you find youre self broke,you can find many part time jobs,then gamble youre money. OR you could sell everything you have got.Graphic wis...Well they have barely improved upon the Dreamcast wich was a disappointment,but loading is super fast. In short if you havent played Shenmue 2 and waant a good little RPG for youre Xbox,this one is it."
5,Favorite Game of all time,"I bought this after having my last copy stolen. I have played this game 40 times literally, i cant stop playing it. I got hooked on the Shenmue series during the dreamcast days. the detail in this game was ahead of its time when it came out. too bad that there will never be a sequel :(PLAY IT! you wont be disappointed!"
5,Excellent stuff,"Excellent stuff, even if you are not a Death Note fan. Very upbeat and funny. The album art is a bit ""too crazy"" for me, but this is the only complaint."
5,BUY ME NOW!!!,"Really great cd. Obviously I looked then up from the Death Note sountrack thing, and I didn't really expect too much. I was pleasantly surprised though as this is now one of my top three fav CDS!"
2,It's okay,"I went to the Star Wars Celebration III convention last April and waited in line all night to see George Lucas. So I understand the geek inside all Star Wars fans to want to wait in line for a Star Wars film. I don't think I'd wait weeks though. But more power to those who do!Anyhow, I found this film interesting, but surprisingly it doesn't have much to do with Star Wars. It's more about certain people in the line and what they had to put up with for the few weeks they were out there. It's more of a reality TV show than a documentary on Star Wars fans. And ultimately, I found myself not caring much for some of the fans, so I wouldn't really watch it again.Worth checking out, but I'd recommend ""A Galaxy Far, Far Away"" for a much better documentary about SW fans."
5,This is a GREAT book to learn Italian.,"I teach Italian at the undergraduate level and this book is excellent. Having used other textbooks in the past, I have seen the difference in how much and how quickly students learn from ""Parliamo italiano"". If you are using this book on your own, I would recommend that you work with a tutor. It is not impossible to work with it on your own but you have to plan the material very carefully beforehand and stick to your plan."
1,How Not To Learn Another Language,"This is the worst book I have ever used for learning Italian. Unfortunately, it is the core book for my uni course. The grammar explanations are awful and at times incomplete. The dialogues would be better off as a soap opera on T.V. The only slight advantage is that it has covered the passato remoto, la cordanza dei tempi (the more difficult stuff) by chapter 10. But what is the point in racing ahead with the grammar when listening, speaking and reading skills are being ignored.I have been forced to use this book for almost 2 years, and I can barely say a sentence in the present tense even though we are in unit 12 grammar wise.When I finish my semester at uni, before I go to Italy in October, I will be spending 5 months solid with a book from the BBC."
1,horrible for a beginner,"Confusing approach; improper sequence to develop concepts & vocabulary. I had experience with conversational Italian and another college text but I am finding this book a nightmare. If you are unfortunate enough to have it as a class text; buy supplemental books (dictionary, grammar, verbs...even another text)and maybe some Pimsleur tapes since conversation skills are shortchanged in this tedious text."
2,"Ok, not great","This is an older textbook, very cheap, and OK. It does not explain grammar however and the exercises are a bit confusing. It's OK if you have other books to use with it."
5,Truly Original,"I got the cd a few days ago and I haven't stopped listen to it yet .... This is a one of a kind band that is diffinitely original .. The music is Amazing , the lyrical content had to be well thought out ... This is the occult and horror mix that just paints a perfect picture of what could be or will be after Death ....I highly recommend this to all Metal fans , no matter what kind of metal you listen to this has something for everyone .."
3,About Hoplite's review,"I've researched the spotlight review ""hoplite Phalanx..."" and it's apparent this person is creating multiple accounts to vote on his reviews! How amazon lets this person do what he is doing is appaling. The filthy language (although censored) he uses in his music reviews is not necessary, and in no way is it even possible for him to garner the vote count he has. Look at his rank.Look at his rank.Then look at his total number of votes, and just compare them to the other reviews around him. It is obvious whats going on. Sad and pathetic. As a newcomer to Amazon I find this distasteful to say the least. His account as well as all his reviews should be removed.Betty"
1,Broke and difficulty in getting return auth.,I puchased this unit and was able to use it a total of three time before is quit operating. I called (on 3/3/06) to request permission to return the unit. Was told that a return label would be mailed out on Monday. It seems that they only go out on Mondays. I failed to get the label and called again (3/16/06). Was told they would send out again. Called again on 3/20/06 and again on 3/31/06 and still have not gotten return auth. I would not deal with Tristar (distribution company for this juicer) for any product ever again and would suggest that you not get involved either. Not responsive to service after the sale. Billed my credit card and have had my money for over a month and I have had a defective product.
2,Jack Lalane Power Juicer,I ordered this juicer a couple of months aga.The infamercial advertised that it would come with two recipe books.It came with out the instuction book and with out the recipe book.It took me almost a month to get them to send me the instruction book. Now my 30 day money back garentee is no longer...I still ncan not get the recipe books from them... the keep telling me they will send them and they do not. The people at the customer service are rude and mean.I really wanted those recipe books!
4,works well,"The juicer is good and takes lots of the pulp out of the fruit; however, the clean-up is a pain! It will take 30 secs to make a great juice, but 5 minutes to wash."
2,GOOD ADVERTISING / DOES NOT LIVE UP TO DEMO'S,"TODAY I RECIEVED MY PRODUCT AND AM VERY DISATISFIED. ALTHOUGH THE COMMERCIAL WAS GREAT { I WATCHED JACK AS A CHILD MANY YEARS AGO IN THE EARLY 60s.} IT DOES NOT JUICE MANY OF THE FRUIT THAT THEY SHOW IN THE COMMERCIAL ALSO MANY OF THE FRUIT SUCH AS ORANGES , BANANNA'S AND GRAPEFRUIT MUST BE PEELED FIRST, THEY MAKE A BIG DEAL ABOUT HOW YOU CAN BUT WHOLE FRUIT IN TO THE MACHINE ON THE INFO-MERCIAL "" NOT SO "" AND PUTTING TOGETHER THE MACHINE IS QUITE COMPLICATED, NOT FOR SOMEONE WHO IS TOOL, OR FIX IT CHALLANGED, AND I AM A MAN. IT WILL PROBABLY SIT IN THE CLOSET WITH OTHER USELESS GADGETS AND COLLECT DUST. SORRY TO SAY I BOUGHT THE PRODUCT BECAUSE OF JACK LA LAINE, IT WAS NICE SEEING HIM DOING SO WELL. BUT IT COST TOO MUCH."
3,Life and Adventures of Alexander Selkirk,"This book is not like Robinson Crusoe but more of a written list of what Alexander Selkirk did. You are not there seeing Robinson Crusoe's progress, hopes and dreams, but that he lived there, did a couple of things and left.I am still glad I bought the book though. It gives me some insight into the times regarding privateers and how they risk people's lives and killed to make a slightly better living than back home.The book looks like a copy made from the original pages and cleaned up, and not reprinted from a new document. This did not bother me though."
1,Flash is extremely buggy now,"Flash 4 was the pinnacle of flash-dom. This version crashes all the time, and Macromedia has not offered a fix."
1,Dud,Didn't work from out of the packaging. seemed to work intermittently IF you back off the coax connector from fully screwed down. then quit working entirely. i should have paid more (?) and gone to Newegg or TigerDirect.
1,No adapter or cable included,"I wish I had known that this antenna doesn't come with the coax cable or SMB to F adapter which are both necessary to connect to the home base. Antenna isn't any good without either of these two parts. Now I have to go find these, extra cost and extra time without use of antenna."
1,Wrong Adaptor,"The unit arrived and I hooked it up to the roof and went to add the F to SMB adaptor to the Delph Skyfi unit and guess what, it does not fit. They sent me the wrong adaptor for my unit. I check on Amazona and could find no place to contact them or the vendor. Really frustrated."
1,Does Not Work! Do Not Buy Terk XM6,I recently tried to connect my XM6 antenna and found it isn't working.I've contacted Terk by email and will up-date my review once I seem what they will do.So for now it gets only 1-Star.2009.11.24 : UpdateI emailed customer support and all they said was to call the 800 number.Called Tech Support and they immediately told me the unit was defectiveand bounced me over to customer support. We went back and forth for about 15-20 minutesmost of the time I was on hold. I had the unit for a little over 1 year but it wasn't un-packageduntil about 2 weeks ago. Since the 1 year period was over they would not honor their warrantyand the person suggested I just buy a new unit. This is not good customer support.I will avoid this product/company in the future.
5,Terk XM6 Antenna,"I live in a mountain area subject to heavy snow. This antenna out-performs the ""heavy duty"" ones I have for tv and internet. I have not had to touch it in this last storm, which brought 3 feet of snow. The antenna is pretty much buried, but has no difficulty pulling a strong signal. Would definitely recommend."
1,Doesn't Work,"Followed directions. Tried to get signal at every angle possible. The little black antenna that came with my XM radio picks up a better signal. The Terk picked up no signal. Cheaply made, almost lost one of the two screws holding it together the first day I had it. My friendly advice would be that if it works for you, great, but I would not recommend this product to anybody. I live in suburban northern Virginia and shouldn't have a real difficult time picking up a signal. Oh well, so much for the ""up grade"", I'm sticking my little black antenna back outside."
1,Terk XM6 XM Antenna,"This product was dead out of the box. I purchased it on 4 July 2010, but didn't get around to installing it until this weekend, so I'm also outside the return window. The XM receiver didn't recognize the antenna. Hooked up the small antenna that came with the receiver, and everything is fine. How difficult can it make be to make an XM antenna? Would not recommend this product under any circumstances."
1,Quit working within 30 days,"I installed the antenna where the best signal could be received. Within 30 days, the antenna was only working on a sporadic basis. Some days itwould work all day, other days it would not work at all or for just a few hours. At this point it has completely stopped working. I have no ideawhat caused this to happen, but it is not worth the investment. I have the same problem with other Terk products. I am searching for an antenna madeby anyone other than Terk."
5,Terk XM Antenna,"Great product, easy setup. Installed on a flag pole. Full bar reception all the time"
5,Magic,"XM was the only alternative when the last Classical FM station in South Florida was turned into a Hip Hop station. I love the service all except for the fly in the ointment that sometimes the signal is flawless and other times it fades in and out like an echo in the alps. I bought extensions to position the antenna in every possible angle and position with no success. I did a search yesterday after seriously considering tuning my XM receiver with a sledge hammer, and found this Terk on Amazon and had it overnighted. All I can say is for the first time in a year I have a consistent clear signal and uninterrupted music. I think part of the reason is that you use coax cable to connect it to the receiver unit; in my case the Polk Audio XRt12. I had been using the supplied cable and antenna which is thinner and smaller. Back to loving satellite radio. Highly recommended if you have trouble with your signal."
4,"Works great, but almost HAVE to moutn outside","I bought this antenna originally because in my apartment I didn't have straight shot to the southern sky, so I thought buying this and placing it near or outside my window it would work fine. Well, to say the least, that didn't work out as planned. I could barely find reception, but I can't blame it for not working in that situation I guess it wasn't intended to do such magic.However, on the good side, I have since moved and have mounted the product on the side of the house. Now I get perfect reception with absolutely zero interruptions! Would recommend to anyone that has a place for mounting."
4,Pretty good,"Ok, this game is the best pc skating game available now.....u ntil 10/25/00 when tony hawk pro skater 2 comes out for PC. The andy macdonald game is definitely worh the money, it's a lot of fun, the levels are huge, and there are lots of tricks to learn. I've been playing it for about a month now, and still haven't seen everything in the game,....But, the guy who said that it blows tony hawk away either doesn't skate, or has never played the tony hawk 2 pc demo. I cannot wait another 2 days for the full version. I have the THPS2 demo, and for the last week, I havent even booted up the andy mac game because there is so much to do in the one level you get with the demo. I love both of these games, and am so relieved that you no longer have to buy a game console to get a really good skateboarding game."
5,Great documentary,"Bought this for my father, but found myself wanting to watch it as well. It is a well researched documentary on the finding and restoration of 'Glacier Girl"", a P-38."
5,DVD,"Good DVD.Note: One of the plane used in locating the lost squadron, a C-47 was at the May 2011 Virginia Beach Air Show. While I was taking a picture of this plane, a nice lady invited me aboard the plane and allowed to look around and she told me that this was the plane seen in the lost squadron documentary, but since had been repainted Army Green. She showed me a book with a pictures of this plane as it looked in the film."
1,Blah.,"I recieved this item as a gift. Well, my first impression of the book itself sucked. When it arrived the rings on the binder were broken. Luckily, I had already gone out and bought a 3-ring binder and a bunch of folders for organizing my wedding planning needs. I went through this ""book"" and took the important pages and moved them into my binder with my other wedding planner and, well, I've never really looked at them much since. This book is just a basic workbook.Q: A___Q: A___Q: A___That's basically most of the book. Being a first time bride with pretty much no ""real"" idea as to what goes into a wedding (I really thought I knew, until I started planning mine!) I would have been totally lost with this book alone.I recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1887169369/ref=lpr_g_2/102-2926500-7256929?v=glance&s;=books"">Easy Wedding Planning Plus</a> instead of this book."
5,Creative Wedding Organizer & Planner is Amazing!,Theresa Chan's wedding organizer and planner is a must for any bride. I loved the fact that it is a binder and I was able to add my own pictures to the book. The book includes all the essential sections for a wedding and I particularly appreciated that she outlined many things a bride should consider that I never thought of.I have been married for a few months now and have a wonderful keepsake binder of my wedding which I can pass on to my future children and grandchildren. The quality of the binder and its contents are outstanding.
5,Llewellyn! Please bring this back into print!,"Llewellyn publishes something good in the early 90's an it never comes back, while tripe gets republished over and over.....Anyway, ""Crafting the Art of Magic"" is a must for anyone interested in the history of Wicca. Okay, so we all know the usual story--Wicca is 50,000 years old, Wicca is from an unbroken line of English witches, Wicca is blah, blah. Kelly actually goes back to primary sources, picks them over and shows his work. It's not infallible, of course--he puts more faith in a few of his theories than proof--but it's an honest effort and a worthwhile read if you can snag a copy."
5,Best book for Craft History,"Aidan's book is most important for the history of Witchcraft. Its debunkers can be seen for what they are: ignorant and unable to cope with the real roots of their professed religion. The fact that they believe Gardner created/brought back ""Wicca"" instead of Witchcraft shows how little they understand the real Craft. Gardner did not write ""Wicca Today."" Crafting the Art of Magic is a scholarly work that anybody interested in Craft history should read."
1,An unfortunate beginning to a history of Wicca,"Kelly's work has perhaps one useful function; as a test of an ability to read critically. Further critique beyond that provided by Frew is probably unnecessary; his detailed examination of Kelly's errors in logic, the unnecessary anti-Catholic commentary and lack of familiarity with academic standards are clear and concise. These points added to the mysteriously-disappearing ""Weschcke documents"" that Kelly uses as his source material make this an inauspicious beginning to a textual examination of a new religious movement. Fortunately the work by Heselton and Hutton demonstrates that there is room to expand the inquiry into historical research."
2,Poor Scholarship,This book has more assumption than it does research that has been proven false. See Don Frew's Critical Review here:http://www.gryffintower.com/kelly.htm
5,Revealing,"Beginning with the first chapter I was immediately engaged by this brilliantly orchestrated well-written novel. I found this book to be packed with suspense, rousing, revieting and fueled with an air of danger. This work is remarkably realistic, dealing with national current events.This book could be a great screenplay for a movie!"
4,Adopts a pretty big definition of 'British',"Nice little pieces on the areas Britain has affected but now leaves alone - nearly 4 pages on Australia, 1 each on Canada and New Zealand. Also helpful to find those weird, typically British obsessions: pigeon-fancying, seaside holidays and Tractarianism (go look them up). The kind of book you go to to look up one topic and find yourself reading for an hour. Failed to score 5 stars because it failed to record biographies on influential British sportsmen."
3,Fighting Time,"There are some games that hold up over time, this is a letdown for almost a decade later. I decided to try it, I find I constantly run into enemies far stronger then me. Combat is choppy at best, and the graphical differences really break immersion. The game overall is alright but the really lazy system puts it down. The combat system, spell skills, etc, all have a very strange system and I feel like I'm pausing time whenever I access them, and this isn't a game where time manipulation has much place. Your spells are far too weak for the enemies you encounter, a heal at level 2 will heal for 14 on average while a lvl 2 opponent would have done 30 damage in the time you spent healing. I really don't understand the map and it feels poorly done even for early PS2. But the overall killer has to be the loading time."
3,"Has its flaws, but still a pretty good RPG overall.","The controls could use some work, the graphics are obviously outdated, and the voice work is terrible. But aside from these flaws I enjoyed Summoner. It's a good game - not bad, not great. I would give it 4 stars but...In a town near the end of the game I came to a bug that has preventd me from finishing the game. In a place that you normally walk through to go to the next area, nothing happens when I walk there. It doesn't trigger the transition to the next area... so I'm stuck. I tried several things but nothing worked so I eventually just quit playing.However, I realize that this bug is most likely a rare thing and so I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. But I still felt it was worth mentioing... and so I give it 3 stars."
4,A Sadly Overlooked Game,"This game is, simply put, an incredible work for its time. Graphics are unimportant to me, but they're good in this game for the time it was made. More importantly it's an RPG that mixes some elements of action, witout losing any length or depth. Think Knights of the Old Republic only with traditional RPG depth and open endedness and more action packed battles (sorry, no light sabers though). Summoner still has an immersive world filled with interesting characters which can grow and lose hands and things. If you enjoy the character building and intelligence of RPGs but you get tired of slow-paced turn-based fighting, this game is for you."
1,XP Home/SP2 Review,"The game screen freezes 5-10 times per hour.No pattern to these lockups: during a fight; just walking; picking up an item; cutscene etc...ALT+CTRL+DEL won't always close the program ... I have to manually crash/power down the computerI have installted patch v1.40; no help.My SYS SPECS(... one year old computer) are much higher than the requirements.THQ doesn't respond to e-mails for this game ... I did send one about a new game and received a reply = guess older games aren't high on their $upport(... no money in it for them)There is no game knowledge base at THQ for Summoner ?The game looks intereting and the reviews are positive.So, those with earlier OS(...WIN 2000 not supported = mentioned upon installation) would do well to give this game a try.I'm surprised a game from 2001 won't run on XP Home/SP2.Just played one from 1996 and had no problems."
4,summmoner,This game is very good but i think should come with a book to help you solve stuff am currently stuck in monastary if anyone can help me with this i would appreciate it
4,This demo is quite something,The demo features excellent graphics and gameplay that is superior to any Final Fantasy (the game that it most closely resembles). The fact that my cousin did some of the monsters makes it even cooler.
5,Live Wisely James,We are using this book in our men's group.....Alot of great information for a man to look at his life and see how it compares to the values Christ teaches.
3,If you have a kid ages 3-6 then buy!,"Everyone knows that the Xbox does not have many E-rated games (aside from sports) and is targeted at teens, after all this is why you get an Xbox over a lamecube. Fortunately, Sneakers provides some relief for your child(ren) aged 3-6 you should get this game. But if your not that age this is no fun at all and could be considered the worst game on Xbox (For you, anyways).It's not that hard to figure that out as it is a Toys R Us exclusive."
1,They wouldn't let me choose a zero,"If you have a child still in the womb then buy this game for them at a garage sale for less than 25 cents. If you have kids any older than zero then forget it at any price...unless you want it as a collectible then don't open it, you can thank me later. How many ways can you say doo doo. Buy this game and you will discover a bunch of em. Not worthy of PS 1 much less the Xbox."
5,Great book!,This book really gives insight into the world of slavery and the political views of the Civil War era. Great book!
5,Great Coffee Mug,"This is the best coffee travel mug I have ever had. It doesn't leak when the lid is closed. It keeps your beverage hotter longer than any other mug I've had. It's easy to wash, easy to hold and fits in your vehicle cup holder. I may have found a great gift idea."
5,"Thermos Nissan 14-Ounce Leak-Proof Travel Mug, Smoke","Great coffee mug. Leakproof and keeps coffee hot for 2-3 hrs depending how often you open and close it. After that, your coffee stays warm for hours."
5,Finally... a PERFECT cup!,I've looked for years for the perfect travel mug and this is it! I really have nothing more to say. It is flawless. It has everything I want in a cup. Nothing more. Nothing less.
5,hot coffee for hours,"This is now my daily coffee mug, even though I have several others. For a slow coffee drinker, it's perfect. I make a double latte each morning and can take 3-4 hours to enjoy it because it stays hot. The only downside is that the lid needs to be taken apart to be cleaned. I have to use a scrub brush and really hot water to make sure it's clean, but it is worth the effort. I suppose you could put it in the dishwasher, but after having one lid to my favorite mug melt this way, I now wash them by hand."
5,Awesome Mug,I love this mug. It keeps my drink hot and is leak proof. I am able to add sweetner while tea is steeping and then turn it upside down without spillage. There is no need to stir it. I bought a second one to have on hand just in case they change the product. My son told me about this mug and he can't say enough good things about it.
5,Third man review,"Ive had three of these... not because they break either... I manage to misplace them I think, or else someone else likes them more than me (hard to imagine) and makes them disappear.The unit is nearly unbreakable, but do not drive your car over the cap or bottle; its not guaranteed for that!Top item: it does not spill when the cap is tightened and it falls over.I love it."
4,GOOD ONE!!!,I recently gifted this product to my husband. It works really good. He usually takes cold tea or coffee to work. It remains cold for hours together. We have not really used it for carrying the hot beverages. Will see when Winter comes. But I presume that it will work just fine.
2,Keeps Coffee Hot; Very Annoying Lid,"Keeps coffee hot, as like Thermos 20 oz Thermos model 2650, but lid on this 14 oz. mug is difficult to use, leaks when drinking if not opened carefully, and hard to clean.You really need to want this mug to buy one - it doesn't recommend itself."
2,Great for 6 months--top feel apart--not worth money,"Though I agree that for the first 6 months I owned this, it was a great travel cup, kept my coffee warm, it was spill proof in my backpack, and attractiveHowever, after only 6 months, the screw on cap fell apart into two pieces after washing it in hot (not boiling) water. I've had some of my cheaper coffee mugs for years and have never experienced this. So now this expensive mug is totally useless. An expensive product for the limited time I've used it. I could have bought a cheaper mug for 1/3 of the price, and though it may not have kept my coffee quite as hot, it sill would have been fine.Do not buy--either that, or don't wash the lid in hot water."
2,Keeps it hot but too big for cupholder,"Leak-proof, definitely, but you still have to be careful. When you screw in the lid, some coffee may remain around the rim, and this can leak out when the mug is overturned. I usually turn the mug upside down and shake it to get rid of the extra drops.There is also no visual indication that the top is sealed. So you can plop the coffee mug onto the seat, and coffee leaks out because you can't tell whether the mug is sealed all of the way. User error? Carelessness? Perhaps a little, but the design needs to be reworked a bit. I recommend the Nissan 14-oz stainless steel vacuum travel tumbler at [...]The mug is too wide to fit in the cupholders of my 1996 Subaru Outback. I usually prop up the mug next to a bag or books but invariably the mug tips over and the coffee spills out for one of the above reasons.If it weren't for these reasons, I'd love the mug. It keeps the coffee hot, and it's nice to have a handle to grab hold of."
2,Tastes like plastic when used with hot beverages,"I poured hot coffee in the mug. When I drank from the mug, the small of plastic overwhelmed the smell of the coffee. I was quite disappointed.Sure, the mug probably doesn't spill, but I don't want to save coffee which I can barely stand to drink. I do give it a second star for being an otherwise well-designed mug."
2,poorly designed,"I am guilty of checking reviews and depending on them when I look for a product. I wish I would of searched longer before settling on this one. I have a Nike travel mug which i love, but my husband needed one. I looked for the one I bought but I couldn't find it as I purchased it at the outlet and they did not carry them any longer. This mug is a smilers size than what I am used to. The inside is metal so it can't go in microwave. The lid is made strangely and it twists to become looser and thats how you drink it. It makes it awkward to drink as you can't see the liquid first. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,If you don't mind unscrewing a lid before buying...you may like. I however did not read the description before buying....bad buy,"I screwed up, i did not read product description. You actually have to unscrew the top off and remove lid to take a sip of coffee...HELLO!!!!"
2,Let Down!,Disappointed to find that the lid separates allowing liquids to gather in lid and leak out.But does keep coffee hot and does not leak once lid is on and tight.....
3,Not as advertised.,"Not as advertised. Mug was listed under""microwavable mug"" but writtendirections that came with the mug instructed ""DO NOT microwave""."
2,"If you have seen better products, you will avoid this one!","There is a logical mistake in the design of this cup. You can not pick it up and drink water when you are driving. The reason is simple, to drink water, you need to twist the cap open with two hands to loose the seal. Otherwise, if you want to pick it up and drink, you need to left the seal loose all the time. Then, how can the water not leak?!The cup isn't as good as it looks on the webpage. My girlfriend says it ugly the moment she saw it.Actually, I bought this cup to use it in my office. It turns out the 14oz capacity is too small for that purpose.I expect to pay a high price and get a decent product. But I would say if I have to buy this one, it worths around $15 for me.After spending thousands of dollars on Amazon, I have to say this one is my worst buy yet."
2,Too much money for asking price.,"This cup doesn't hold enough liquid, and it doesn't keep it hot long enough. For the price I paid for this, it should've been better. If you're looking for a top notch coffee mug, this ain't it, even though it does a good job at preventing coffee leaks."
2,LOOKS ARE DECEIVING,"IT LOOKS NICE AND COOL, BUT IT ONLY KEEPS DRINKS HOT FOR AN HOUR AND THE PRICE IS KINDA OF HIGH FOR THAT FEATURE. I WOULD SURE BUY IT IF IT KEPT DRINKS HOT FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME."
4,Great if you want a thermos,"On the plus side, this keeps liquids hotter than anything I've ever used. If closed tightly it really does not leak.But closing it isn't the problem. It can form a pretty tight seal and to grasp and turn the very smooth ridge on the top can require dexterity, especially if your hand or the top is wet.Also, the lip is not flat, but curves up on either side, presumably to facilitate drinking without spilling. But it means you have to be very careful if you want to put anything on top, like an AeroPress. Because it is taller than wide, ""mug"" and press can tip over if you, as I am, are not exactly awake first thing in the morning. The handle sticks out quite a bit. This is probably fine for a car. But you really can't pack this as easily as you could if there were no handle."
2,I thought it would keep coffee hot longer!,"I was looking for a thermos bottle type cup, a product that would keep coffe hot for a long time [hours]. 30 to 45 minutes its cold. It does look nice."
1,Rubber fails after several months,"I did love this mug and even bought another for a friend. However, after several months the interior rubber starts to break apart and pieces will end up in your beverage. The warranty process is not fun -- You have to pay for the shipping back to Thermos and then they don't guarantee which model you will receive back."
2,Two fatal flaws: a) contact between boiling water and plastic may leach chemicals and b) handle disintegrates,"I've had two of these but have decided to look for another item.It doesn't leak and definitely keeps beverages warm, but because the plastic on the lip and lip repeatedly come into contact with boiling water it may leach harmful chemicals over time.Also, after enough time (4 years in my case) the rubbery handle will begin to disintegrate into a sticky, mushiness.My ideal mug would be in this shape and size, but 100% stainless steel interior/lid with a handle that doesn't disintegrate."
3,This one leaks!,My new tumbler leaks when I tighten the lid to a normal close. I have to ratchet the lid on this one down too tightly to reopen easily. Probably an isolated quality control issue. Have had a half dozen of these tumblers because I think they are the best - none of the others have leaked. OXO's leakproof tumbler was tried but the mechanism is impossible to clean throughly and over time got all gunky and I'm not a big fan of yucky floaty's in my coffee. I'll keep buying these Nissans - simply the best there is!
3,"Good, for a while","I bought this cup four months ago. It worked great, the coffee stayed hot, and only occasionally would it leak. But the lid would get stuck from time to time, until it broke in half, making the cup unusable."
3,"Hottest Coffee ever & no more accident of spill, but the lid is not 1-piece....","Thermos is the Japanese company. I have been using their product since 15 years ago. When I found this mug available in USA, I purchased one for my husband as he will take a cup of coffee to enjoy it during traffic jam. He likes the tight lock of this mug. No more spill! He also like the temperature of the coffee. The insulated wall really works!The first month after using this mug, we found the lid could be separated into 3 parts: The top, the container shaped bottom, and a rubber band. It was very yucky first time we dis-assembled the lid since coffee and cream can get into it through the seam. Ever since, we dis-assemble the lid every time we wash the mug. A little hassle, but for the nice & hot coffee, it can be tolerated!"
5,Great insulated mug,"I really love this mug.The manufacturer claims that it will keep coffee hot for one hour. HA! Three hours is more like it. The lid can be screwed down to form a very tight seal, or it can be opened with 1/2 of a turn to permit drinking and still provide good insulation.My only complaints are minor:1. It takes two hands to unscrew the lid once it has been sealed.2. One time, I had the lid on so tight that it actually formed a tight vacuum seal, making it very difficult to open."
3,Thermos Nissan JMQ400 14 ounce travel mug,"Got this to replace my older Thermos Nissan 16 ounce (discontinued) travel and soup mug. I am very disappointed in the performance of this mug. I warm the mug with hot tap water and then add boiling water with some instant coffee, in less than 3 hours it is just warm, not hot. My older mug, when new, was good for 6-8 hours. Also if you're a coffee lover the 14 ounce size is just too small. I do like the top as you can close off and no leaks, but with cold, luke warm coffee who cares about that."
5,"Great mug, easy to clean","I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She uses it for hot tea on our commute to work. It must be good because she is particular, and she's commented that she likes it. My only minor complaint is that it can be difficult to open sometimes. Otherwise, a great product."
5,Spill proof wonder,"The double stainless vacuum wall keeps coffee hot, and the leak-proof lid is really leak-proof. I carried this mug almost everyday for almost five years now, and no drips. I love that it can tumble out of the car cup holders without worrying about spills, stains, or hot coffee on my lap.I do hand wash mine, as the user manual says it's not dishwasher safe.Not only does the stainless double wall keep your drink hot, it doesn't add any off flavors like plastic does. Nothing spoils fresh-roasted, fresh-brewed coffee more than plastic overtones.The construction is very durable. This mug will take being dropped, kicked, and crammed into crevices. I suspect I will eventually have to replace the o-ring on the lid but haven't had to yet. If I ever do have to replace the mug, I will be replacing it with the exact same mug.An interesting FYI, this mug does fit into bicycle bottle cages-for you java junkies that need coffee while biking."
5,Best mug ever,"I've been using this mug for about 5 years now and have found it to be the best travel mug available.It doesn't leak. Period. Screw the lid shut, turn it over. No leaks. Since the lid screws on, rather than pops on, there's no chance that the lid will pop off. I put this mug in my bag right next to my laptop without hesitation.Drinks stay hot for hours. I leave for work in the morning and my coffee is still warm 4-5 hours later.It's easy to drink on the go, just screw the lid open a half-turn to drink. Another half-turn and it's sealed shut.It comes with a carabiner so you can clip it to your bag.The base is small enough so that it will fit in most car cup holders.And to top it off, Thermos Nissan will replace it if it breaks, starts to smell bad, etc.It's the best mug ever. It's a little pricier than some other models and only holds 14oz but it's perfect."
4,does not fit in a Tassimo,"Mug is really nice. Keeps coffee hot. I should have done the measurements first, but after purchasing found it is too tall to fit in a Tassimo coffee maker."
4,Fantastic for heat retention,"As the description provided claims, keeps your warm beverages hot for much, much longer than other mugs. Great if you drink slowly like me, but also good so you can make coffee at home and want it to still be hot & fresh when you get to work. The mug is pricey, but for the heat retention alone, it is very worth it to me. I worked at a coffee shop for 2 years that sold Nissan Thermoses, I never heard a single complaint or had one returned.I personally do have a few very minor complaints. The lid that makes it leakproof is somewhat problematic. If you screw the lid too tightly when you fill the mug, as your hot bev cools somewhat it seems to form a vacuum and it can be very difficult to unscrew the lid again. Also, the only way to tell if the lid is truly closed all the way is by feel- so a few times I have mistakenly thought the mug was closed (looked like it!) and found out the hard way that it wasnt the case. A frustrating lesson to learn!"
3,Difficult to open to drink,"We usually like Nissan mugs because they keep the coffee hot for hours, but this model proved to be too difficult for my husband to turn the top to drink. If you tighten it too much so it won't spill, you run the risk ofhaving a hard time opening it to drink."
3,Great but the lid...,"It keeps water hot for a really long time - so that's great, but the lid can be hard to open sometimes."
3,Handle gets sticky over time...,"I have had this mug for over a year now, and I really like it EXCEPT for the fact that the rubberized handle gets sticky in a very nasty way over time. I have tried numerous cleaning products--even Goo-Gone--and the stickiness always returns. So, my next mug will definitely be without any rubberized parts. YUCK!"
5,I Love It!,"It's not the cheapest travel mug out there, but it keeps my coffee hot, and I don't have to worry about spilling with the top sealed. I had a travel mug with a little slider deal that would minimize splashing, but I still had to keep it upright. With this mug I seal the top like a Thermos (no pun intended), and I can literally turn it upside down with no spilling. This feature comes in very handy when I'm trying to carry things and open doors etc. as I travel to work. I heat this mug up with hot water about 15 minutes before I fill it with coffee, and it keeps my coffee hot for a couple of hours."
5,Keeps my coffee hot all day,"For once, I bought a good travel mug. It fits in my car cupholder, seals tightly enough that I can put it in my purse without it leaking on my books/laptop/Kindle, keeps my coffee hot for at least 4-6 hours so that it's still hot even if I forget about it, and doesn't hold smells (although you will need a bottle brush to clean it, unless you have childlike small hands.) The stainless inside will stain, but I don't mind that. I also don't put milk in my coffee, so I couldn't tell you about milk smells. Definitely the best mug I have ever owned."
5,keeps it hot!~,i bought this as a christmas present to a coffee lover. it keep the coffe hot for a long time
5,My favorite coffee mug!,"This mug is the awesome. It's awesome because I don't know how many times I've accidentally tipped it over and the coffee/hot beverage of choice, DID NOT LEAK out of it (you do have to screw the lid on pretty tight). So if you want a coffee mug that you can trust that it won't spill all over the place, buy this one. It also keeps my beverage warm for almost 2-3 hours sometimes."
5,great mug,This mug is as absolutely awesome as the reviews on Amazon reported. The liquid stays HOT (or cold) for hours and the lid is very easy to use. I did find myself over tightening it at first until I found the lock/unlock groove. Personally I think it holds plenty of coffee because I don't gulp fearing that the hot is about to turn cool! I've had other mugs but this is THE ONE.
5,Cup envy,"I bought this mug as a Christmas present for my stepson who lays tile for a living. He absolutely loves it. He says it keep his coffee hot for longer than any other mug he has used. While at work one day, the customer came up and grabbed his mug - he said he had been looking all over for one of these. He said he did tons of research and this is the best Mug of its kind. He was shocked we got it through Amazon.com because that is one place he didn't try finding one. Buy this you won't regret it."
3,Good but not great,"I've owned this mug for several years and am an avid coffee drinker. This mug is very durable; it keeps coffee hot or warm for up to 4 hours; it is spill-proof; it generally does what it is supposed to do. There is however one major flaw that prevents it from being my 'go-to' mug on a daily basis - To ensure that nothing leaks out, I need to put the lid on somewhat securely before tossing it into the car. If I don't open it for a length of time, the coffee begins to cool/condense creating a vacuum. The vacuum in addition to the already snug lid creates situation that makes it very very difficult to open.While this mug is good, and better than many mugs on the market, I suggest you consider the ""Thermos E10500 16-Ounce Leak-Proof Travel Mug"". It keeps my coffee hot longer and I've never had any difficulty opening it (because of a different lid design).Hope this helps."
3,Thermos-14 oz,"This is a pretty very nice mug, however, it sometimes seems to leak around the top seam on the outside of the mug. I have had pop in it and sometimes when I take a drink, it drips on my shirt. Maybe when you have carbonated pop in the mug it might under pressure seep from inside to the outside seam and will leak through. For the price of this mug, I would have expected it to be of better quality. In it's description, it says Leak-Proof, however, mine is not Leak-Proof."
5,really like these,my husband and I both have these they keep the coffee hotter than any of the others we have tried!
5,Excellent,Does exactly what it's meant to and is the first thermos that is completly leak proof! Keeps the drink nice and hot. Also if you want the drink to cool down you can just leave the top off.
5,Great mug! Actually leak proof!,"I was very interested in finding a mug that I could take from home with me in the morning, keep in my purse during my public transit commute, and still enjoy hot coffee out of when I arrived at work. I tried this with many mugs and ended up with a puddle of cold coffee in my purse instead. But I've finally found it! This mug is great! Coffee stays hot and the lid truly seals."
1,not as advertised,Coffee stays hot for 4 hours??? NOT. Maybe an hour if you're lucky.Difficult to unscrew top.Small capacity.Chuck
2,Fatal Flaw,"Liquid eventually gets into the gap in the 2 piece lid and mildew has a field day. Then you have to crack the lid open to clean it out, but it gets easier for fluid to get in there every time you open it... I loved this thing for months, now it's in the trash.Too bad because it's otherwise perfect."
2,"Good, but could be better","The good - it keeps the drink hot for a long time (5 hours or so) and is nice and sturdy.The bad - the lid gets sucked down as the drink cools and sometimes you can barely get the thing unscrewed. To get it fully leakproof you have to get it screwed pretty tight.The better - Thermos Stainless King SK1005MB4 16-Ounce Leak-Proof Travel Mug. I love this model and is the one you should look at if you want a great, easy to use care-free mug that keeps your dirnk hot for a loooong time."
5,Excellent spill-proof mug.,"I've used the mug for over a year and have no complaints. When the lid is turned tightly, no coffee spills. It keeps coffee hot for at least a few hours. I bought a total of 3 mugs for my wife and as a spare because they are very good. Buy a long brush to clean the interior of the mug more easily. I keep it in one of my backpack water bottle pocket clipped. It does not fall while walking."
5,Nissan Thermos Travel Mug,"I am here to tell you.... this in my own opinion is the best mug available. I will keep my coffee Hot too warm for hours, this is my 4th mug. I have nothing to say but greatness for the thing, it is a great looking mug, keeps your fluids hot, I have never attempted cold beverages in it. But would be willing to bet it would work as good or better with cold. It is vacuum sealed, so do not leave alone to long in the hot mode and closed. The vacuum will tighten that lid to where you almost need a pair of pliers to get`r off. I am done rambling, go out and get yer self one ;>)Doug H."
2,Lukewarm,"This does not keep liquids hot even if I prime it with hot water for awhile before dumping that and adding hot tea. Seriously, liquid cools in less than 15 minutes. Sipping from it with the lid on is unsatisfactory, you barely get a mouthful. I find that you have to unscrew the cap and take it off completely, which defeats the purpose of a travel mug. I do like the handle though. It's a help when juggling packages and doesn't interfere with the cups ability to fit in a car cup holder. I just wish it kept things hotter."
4,Awesome mug! (but could be easier to open),"I really like this mug. I'm a student and wanted a mug I could throw in by backpack and not worry about it leaking, and this is it! It will keep my coffee warm for several hours. The only thing I don't really like is that the lid can be difficult to remove if the inside is cools while the lid is tight. It only takes a little pressure to seal the lid- any more and it can get stuck (I made this mistake when I first got it- no problems since).Having had this mug and the Thermos Tumbler w/360 degree lid, I would make the following suggestion: if it has to seal 100%, get the Leak-Proof. If you can deal with losing a couple drops, get the 360. I liked drinking from the 360 better, but it didn't seal well enough to leave in a backpack. But it wasn't a big deal if I knocked it over and picked it back up."
4,This mug is nearly perfect.,"First, let me start by saying I absolutely love this mug. It fits in cup holders. It has a great, ergonomic handle. It seals completely air tight, and does an incredible job as preventing splashes and spills. And, it keeps drinks hot or cold for an INCREDIBLY long time.My only beef is the capacity of the mug. For me, 14 oz of drip coffee isn't enough to do the job in the morning. However, it is perfect for drive-thru latte stands, so it really depends on your preference for capacity. I actually bought the 20 oz mug for drip, and use the 14 oz mug when I know I'm getting espresso. A bit indulgent, I know.If the capacity of the mug is sufficient for you, then you can't go wrong with this mug. But, if you need a little more java to get you going in the morning, I recommend a larger capacity Nissan Thermos mug."
2,Lid easily becomes stuck,"This mug works great, except for one fatal flaw: If you leave the lid screwed on with hot liquids inside and leave it long enough for the liquid and air to cool then the lid gets stuck because there is a vacuum created. I almost threw the mug out twice because I had such difficulty getting the lid unscrewed. It is also hard to get your fingers down onto the lid to get a good enough grip to unscrew. Now I try to remember to leave the lid open if I know I am not going to finish off my coffee."
4,Worthwhile if 14 oz is enough capacity,"Very good thermal cup. Since many medium drinks at coffee shops are 16 oz, it is too bad they didn't make it 2 oz. larger."
4,"Solid Mug, Some Heat Loss. Two Handed.","Keeps coffee hot for around 2 hrs. Could be longer but there is some heat loss in the top black portion. The bottom and middle are always metallic cold so you can tell its trapping heat, but the top always feels warm after a bit, even if its been kept closed tight. The top part and lid is basically just plastic and rubber, even though its thick.Would also prefer a one handed mechanism. This has to be held between your legs or other hand and then unscrewed to drink from. If you were driving you'd probably lean more towards either leaving it open or not drinking till you're at your destination.One other thing that is not really a fault on this mugs part, it is too tall for the Dolce Gusto Creativa machine if you're planning to use with one. The upper black lip area does not unscrew like I hoped.Still its a pretty decent mug. Good build quality, keeps things hot for a while."
4,It's nice to find a product that is as good as they say it is,"This is a great product. The contents stay hot and it does not leak. My son in law has one and he says the same about his.I sould give it a 5 star rating except there is always some thing that can be improved on. The only problem is I HAVE NOT FOUND that ""THING"" yet."
4,Leak-Proof Travel Mug,"Product is great, keeps my coffee hot enough till I reach my destination; just as advertised. Fits nicely in my vehicle cup holder, hasn't spilled, as long as I've screwed the cover on tight; performs much better than 3 others I've purchased promising the same thing!"
5,This mug is the best... the very best...,"I looked for a long time for a true spill proof, quality mug and this mug fits the bill in every way.."
5,Nissan Thermos,"No problem. Everything with the seller was normal. I bought a ton of these thermoses for myself and as gifts, they are awesome, they never leak, you can throw them in a backpack forget about them for a few hours and when you go to get your drink it's still piping hot and there is no damage in your bag!!! Definitely recommend the product and the seller!!!"
5,First thing we replace after the fire!,"My husband & I have had these mugs for years. We recently lost everything in a wildfire and these are one of those things that make life seem more normal. These mugs were one of the first things we replaced, b/c they are fantastic! We've gotten used to tightening the lid before setting them down. Easy and dependable not to leak. Keeps coffee hot for many hours! Hubby was glad to see the smoke color. Very masculine."
5,Cup excedes expectations,"I have used a number of insulated mugs for coffee over the years, but this mug (which I have used for 4 years) is the best. It is spill proof when the lid is sealed. It even satisfies the airport screeners-they will allow it to go through the Xray scanners full of coffee. The mug will keep coffee hot for 2 hours and warm for 4 hours. I wish it were a little larger, but that it my only complaint. When I lost my first one, I was really upset. Fortunately they were still available so I am now using my 2nd one."
5,Great mug for Tea...,This is a great mug. It's very durable. It holds the heat for my Tea very well. Be careful not to screw the top in the wrong way. It can be tough to get it out. It is the best travel mug I've every owned.
5,Perfect,This mug was exactly what I was looking for. Not too large and spill proof. Keeps my coffee warm all morning.
4,Mug with a handle,"I bought this mug for my husband. I thought it was great especially since it has a handle, but because of the handle it would not fit into his Swedish car's beverage holder. I now use it in my car where it works very well."
5,Bargus,"I was tired of using the plastic travel mugs as it seemed the coffee tasted like it had plastic in it and didn't stay hot for long. My son recommended this one and it is fantastic!!! The coffee seems to stay hot forever, the coffee doesn't leak out and I don't ""burn my mouth"" like I did on the plastic mugs as the flow of the coffee is much better. And--this is beautiful!!! It seems to withstand the many times I have dropped it!! The only con is that it is a little pricey but I ""comparison shopped"" and found this price to be great for this item and will be well-worth it as I will use it every day!!!"
3,"""Kids to the Rescue"" is a book for learning.","I think that kids my age (7)should read this book. If they have a frisky little sister like me, they're going to babysit her soon and they will need to know these things."
5,Baby Journal,I gave this book to my daughter and her husband to keep the memories of the new baby. They are just thrilled. Thanks.
5,I love it! I love it!,"For a first time Mom like me i was so thrilled to fill out the entries in this journal -- it's like writing a letter to our unborn child and this book made it all so much more real to me. I just hope I keep up with the entries over the coming years. It also had a lot more features, entries and overall depth than many of the discount baby books I saw in stores."
5,Humble Bumble's Baby Journal,I was looking for a baby book for my third child and came across this book. I am so glad I did! I love the colors and the pages are sturdy. It gives you plenty of room to write and to put pictures! I love it and would also buy it for a good friend as a gift!
1,For Christians Only,"Just fyi, if you prefer books without religious commentary, this book is not for you.Feel duped - didn't think I had to beware of a Christian book in the regular book section of the store. Also disappointed that Amazon does not mention this in the book description above."
2,Heavy on Bible Quotes: This is a Christian Baby Book,"The book is adorable, but I think there's a severe and unseemly excess of bible quotes. A couple of bible quotes I can deal with, but there are at least FOURTEEN of them and many other references to god/heaven. There is clearly a religious agenda here, something that I prefer not to be packaged surreptitiously along with my baby book.The author could have simply called it a Christian baby book and been honest about it. Including ""humble"" in the title isn't clear enough, as all babies are humble regardless of their religious indoctrination. If I'd known this was a blatant Christian book, I wouldn't have purchased it.So two stars from me, primarily for the dishonesty in labeling. Once again I've had religion jammed solidly down my throat for no clear reason. If heaven is filled with people who engage in this type of dishonest behavior, I'll happily accept the alternative."
5,Simple and Sweet,This makes keeping up with everything easy and enjoyable. The pages are nice with some extra space for our thoughts.
5,New Grandma,"I ordered this journal for my daughter to fill out for my new granddaughter and she just loves it. It has all the information to fill out that she wanted, plus it has the envelopes to put the extra memories in. She liked it so much I ordered one for my other daughter who is pregnant and due in December and I ordered extra for several of her friends who are having babies this summer. It is an excellent baby gift and very reasonably priced. An excellent choice for chronicling baby's development."
5,TratesMom,"This is a great baby book. It has very durable pages, lots of room to write, great storages envelopes, and very cute designs. It's not hokey or overly cutesy-just right!"
1,Sneaky Religious Message,"My husband and I bought this journal because we thought the illustrations and design were cute. After buying the book a couple of months before the birth of our baby, we put the book aside and planned to use it once she was born. Much to our dismay, we opened the book this week and discovered that there are bible quotes on nearly every page. We are not Christians, and we have no desire to preserve our daughter's memories in a religious fashion. Unfortunately for us, it's now too late to return the book. It is completely irresponsible for the publishers of this book and Amazon to fail to mention the many religious messages throughout this book."
1,"a fine choice for Christians, but a rude surprise for non Christian audience","Much to my dismay, this baby book is littered with biblical quotes. This would not be a problem if this delightful fact was mentioned or advertised anywhere, but nothing - not even a sticker on the packaging - suggested this journal's religious leaning. Only underneath the plastic wrap and INSIDE the baby journal, the author professed her religious awakening through having her first baby (also the inspiration for her to create this journal). I understand many Christians are probably rolling their eyes at this point and wondering what the big fuss is with some biblical quotes. I'm sure many of these folks would be equally irritated, if not offended, if this baby journal contains, say, Islamic quotes and texts without any advertisement. I have nothing against any religious oriented products or materials, but I definitely do not appreciate any concealment of such religious intention. A waste of my time and money."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this book thinking that I made the best choice, but when I got it, I wasn't quite happy. Because the size of the book is smaller, there's really not that much room to put pictures into. I thought the pre-cut picture frames are also just a waste. It's nice to have the little envelopes to hold stuff in it, but I think the whole point of having something like this is so you can put everything on a page. There's no space for immunization, w/c I think is very important. And towards the end of the book, the pages for the birthdays become so repetitive that it is now boring."
4,Very cute if you want something different,"There are a lot of pages that are just for pictures, which eats up a lot of space in this book. It includes quite a few ""frames"" so it might really be up the alley of a scrapbooker (which I'm not). I use photo albums, so all the picture pages were a waste for me. Would probably be a plus if you are very handy at the scrapbooking thing.Cute colors and patterns. Very non-traditional, which I liked. Comes with a pull out (paper) growth chart (mine was already falling out when I received it, but it wasn't really damaged so I kept it) which is cute, but it's paper so if you want a more permanent record, I would go with something else for that. Does include a place to document the appearance of individual teeth, which I thought was interesting and a pretty good idea."
4,It is adorable,"This book has really cute illustrations. I really loved this book I just finished it. It is really bright and colorful. There is so much room to put stuff. The only thing it lacks is a month by month of the first year. I love that it has places for both mom and dad to write letters to the baby and pockets to put things. It would be perfect except that the only month by month breakdown of the first year is only two pages and it provides just enough space to write height, weight and one sentence about each month."
4,Sweet,This met my expectations. I especialy like that it has envalopes for sepecial memorabilia as well as a little growth chart.
3,Chrisitan theme,"Nice, but if you are not Christian you will be turned off by the many biblical quotes. I actually pasted photos over many of the god themed quotes."
4,Excellent for baby memories!,"This journal is thoughtfully and simply laid out making it very easy to use. The envelopes provided in the book are great for storing keepsakes such as the baby's bracelet from the hospital or locks of hair. The frames provided to use for photos are on the small side, but others can be purchased from the craft store that may better suit the needs of larger photos. The journal provides space for all major details of the first year and highlights of the 2nd and 3rd years of baby's life.Overall, this is a very good purchase and I wish I had it from day one!"
2,Christian Baby Journal,"This is a pretty cute baby journal, but it is full of bible quotes and other references to God; not for everyone. I bought it off the shelf before I realized this and will be returning it in favor of a religion-neutral book."
3,Pretty Nice Memory Book,"This is a nice baby memory book. It has very colorful pages, many places for photos, some cute quotations, and a few storage pouches for keepsakes like the hospital bracelets.It has the standard baby journal pages, the day I was born, baby shower, first day home, all baby's firsts, family tree, etc.I wish they would make a memory book that was not based on a traditional family though. Not every child will have a mom and dad to write long letters to them in a journal which is why this gets only 3 stars."
2,"Nice journal, but arrived in poor condition :(",I ordered this when I saw it at Target. I looked up the price & it was less expensive thru amazon & I figured I could wait a few days for delivery. I was pretty disappointed to receive a keepsake journal with damage to the binding & cover. What a waste of time...I can't even give it away as a gift - Boooooo...& I would be pissed off if this were intended for a gift - who gives damaged gifts? Lame!
3,WARNING,"Please be warned about shipping if you need this item fast!!! Normally when I have chosen super saver shipping, they actually ship the item within 1-2 business days of the order if it is in stock. This appears not to be their policy anymore, so if you want the book fast go to another web site!!!"
4,Good and simple,I bought this book because I felt like I 'had' to have a baby book but knew that I wouldnt do anything too complicated. This is pretty simple and not asking for too much time or effort (something a new mom has little of). I like that there are spots for photos so it becomes a baby book and a scrap book at the same time. I also like that it goes to 3 years old...the later years are more about the milestones and birthdays.ETA: 5-18-09 I am editting this review to let readers know that I am getting this for my 2nd baby. It seems to be the best of what I am looking for. The bible quotes (as some have mentioned) were not offensive to me at all. I am Jewish and actually didn't notice them all that much. They are written in small-ish text so they don't dominate the page.
2,No thank you...,"This book is cute, yes, but I was very put off by all the biblical quotes throughout. I wanted to purchase a baby memory book, not scripture. Hopefully my (religious) sister will enjoy it."
4,Very nice journal!,"I liked this journal very much.It is very colorful, the paper has a good quality, the illustrations are funny and looking ""kind"".The order came quickly, that was very nice too.There were 2 things that I don't like a lot. 1st - the big vellum envelope for the mementos was teared, and the 2nd - is that the spiral on which the journal is a little bit loose, so when you hold the journal in a vertical position the pages stick out a bit."
5,Great Baby Book,"We used this Baby Journal for our first son, and we are planning on using it for our second child, too. I love that it goes up to age three, and the pages are very colorful and large enough to attach photos, and write captions or stories to go along with the photos or events. A growth chart is included which is an added bonus. I looked at many other baby journals and am glad I went with this one!"
4,So good,Enough space for writing & photos but not enough at the same time... a page for 1sts - great. but would like a book that has room for everyday notes in between the milestone birthdays.
4,"Cute baby journal, religious overtones","I purchased this product after reading several other favorable reviews. It was shipped to me internationally, and I received it in 4 weeks, as promised. My son is not yet born, but I flipped through the journal, and it has many useful pages. It includes three envelopes for baby's first haircut (hair clipping), baby's hospital bracelet, and other memorabilia. It does have several bible quotes and subtly religious overtones, which I did not realize when I purchased it. I probably would have bought it anyway..."
4,Reveiwers were right!,"I just got my book yesterday and I love it! My hubby is a poo-pooer of all things sentimental but even he likes it! The previous reviews are right on..it is very gender neutral...not as frilly as most on the market..very well done..no scrapbbok skills required...and captures the essence of the key things you want to remember and that young kids get a thrill out of hearing about. The only thing that was missing that is in most..is that there wasn't a page to document ""how mommy told daddy"" and that's a pretty key memory to record .although I guess that's one you never forget! :)"
3,Not clear if all nick nacks are acid free. and..,"No where in the journal does it say acid free, so does it mean it's not?Also it's very religious oriented. It has bible quotes in almsot every page. It's not bad, but some people may want a neutral approach."
1,ours appears to be a lemon,"We purchased one of these in early September of 2002. After a few months we noticed a bit of fuzziness in the picture and lines on the ""black"" screen. We didn't think much of it until it died on us in late September of 2003. JVC was gracious to cover the $400 repair. However, another 14 months later and it has died on us again. The TV is 2 years, 2 months old. We purchased it new (not a refurb or floor model) for $1079. JVC says we are on our own. That's a lot of money to waste for a 186lb dead weight in the living room. We will not be replacing it with a JVC, that's for sure!"
3,Basic Teaching Tool,"This video is a good tool for learning ventriloquism. If you are completely new to ventriloquism, I recommend it. However please take note that it is very basic."
2,All about 8 pack,"I bought this for my grandson. Maybe when he is older I will take it out for him. I think there is too much talking for little ones and not enough ""hands on"", visual stimulation."
2,Recycled,"They have the best trumpet-piano rips in all of salsa and creating amazingly great songs as ""Sonido Bestial"" and ""Aguzate."" Despite this, they are guilty of creating the same albums over and over again. This album sounds very repetitive and even though it does reflect their Christian direction, this theme can be done only for so long. ""Creo"" is the standout song with a great trumpet solo and sweet piano playing. Other than this, the rest is just not very inspiring. I would not recommend this album, it just sounds recycled."
5,Healing with Magnets,"Very informative and interesting to learn, what magnets can do for you.I will recommend this book to all my customers. I sell magnetic jewelery and need to know as much as possible about them and this book give much info. Mindy"
3,very good,"I ordered this book used. Before the book arrived, I found out that I could read nearly 50% of this book online for free on the garry null website. It was too late to cancel my order, but I did not regret buying this book. The other 50% of this book which cannot get for free online is stories from different doctors and patients sharing their experiences, and also references with small summaries to different types of research done on magnet therapy. I really enjoyed this book. It is good for people with little or average knowledge about magnet therapy. I give it 3 stars only because I don't think it's on par with the quality of his other books like ""Get Healthy Now!"" Also, I think this book is a bit dated, but still worth having."
3,"Convenient, but not as good","While it's nice to have one bottle to deal with instead of two, I'd much rather buy a carton of the two solution original and get a fresh new lens holder each time I open a box. Plus, my lenses just don't quite feel as clean using the one solution only."
4,manzanita branch,They are very nice but one came cracked where screw is so I glued it in and its fine.The items were shipped promptly.I would order again.
1,Will NOT run on current systems.,"Despite claims that it will run on Windows XP, it will NOT. I think it is Windows 95 or under. Phooey. I needed this to supplement a course I was teaching. Wasted my money."
3,Would have been better on VHS..,"I watched Part One of this years back, and wanted to watch it again, so thought I'd order it from here, rather than go to some mom & pop video store to find it. You can definitely tell it was copied from the VHS form, but unlike other reviewers, I couldn't tell what was missing. (Probably b/c it's been such a long time since I originally watched it). Decent DVD for a decent price..."
3,Shocking Asia Thoughts,This is a transfer from a video tape that used to be found in the old mom and pop video stores. The material is dated and upon viewing one is reminded that a lot has happened in terms of what can be seen in the world particularly by internet. The documentary has few spotted parts of interest but is now passe.
3,"qyite interesting, but i saw more shoking facts..","it is quite interesing, bit there are more shocking facts in asia as eating the brain of analive monkey, and so on..."
2,It is definitely heavy,"This bookshelf reference is an edited subset of content that can be found in the MSDN reference. The books are thorough, but lack good organization. In fact, in some of the books there is no index! I found these books to be pretty useless, and I've tried to return to them many times to justify the purchase and shelf space. They make a terrible reference (because of the lack of index) and only a mediocre tutorial. This COULD have been a great collection... if only it had been better organized and indexed in a more useful way."
3,Mask Arts of Mexico,I found it revealing to see so many and varied kinds of masks all on the pages of one book. It alowed me to compare the masks with others from I have seen around the world. I am surprized at the simalarities.
2,Didn't realize it was a children's book,This book is written for kids. I was interested in the story for adult reading. This is a semi-fictional account recreated as the thoughts of one runner in the race. I'll look for an adult version of the book next time.
5,Filled with heart!,"So much of Molly's personality is in this book. She and Mr. Andy Payne have similar traits. It shows and makes her the perfect biographer! Andy's story is inspiring. Large easy to read print, perfect for young adults and young at heart adults! You will enjoy this one and read it many times!All my loving to you Mrs.Hot Ta'Molly!"
3,great kids book about Andy Payne,This is a great kids book about Andy Payne. I recommend that to anybody who is interested in his remarkable story.
2,skip this one,"I generally disliked this book. Most of the characters are two dimensional, and the much-vaunted bawdiness is really just tedious repetitions of the f-word. Whooppee. Too bad, because the premise is interesting, though I can't say more without straying into spoilers. I'm not entirely sure why I bothered to finish it - normally I just stop reading books I don't like. There are tantalizing bits of interestingness - enough to keep you going, but not enough to make it worthwhile to buy this book unless you're really really really desparate for something to read and have already read everything Bujold, Lee & Miller, and other worthwhile authors have already published."
4,Enjoyable!,"Selina's Rednecks of the Spaceways was just plain fun. Also, except for the maximum wage crack, her politics are better than any of the jokers running for President right now. Get this book! You will enjoy it! pmg"
3,A brisk ride,"Brash and prone to carousing, Drewcila Qwah is one of the best salvagers in the universe, and with her mate (and sometimes lover) Van Gar, she's been having a great time for the past five years. They are hired to ferry a long-lost queen home to rendezvous with the King of Barious. Enemies of Barious kidnapped the queen years ago, and they brainwashed her, so she has no memories of anything except for the past few years. When they reach the rendezvous, Drew finds herself enmeshed deeper in this whole drama than she ever wanted, or thought possible, but her unscrupulous instincts surface and she's determined to make it all to her advantage. This rough and rollicking space adventure is a wild ride full of zany characters and wacky incidents. Rosen tells a good story, but unfortunately there are so many grammatical and editorial errors that plague this book, so some readers may be deterred from ""Queen of Denial""."
3,oh just cracked me up,"do you like bob asprin's humor? terry pratchet's flair? good. now imagine that strong of a voice with enough blue language to make your momma cringe.it isn't going to change your life, but it might make you question your polical views and pepper your speech with #%$&**! It will make you laugh out loud."
5,read this book,"Selin has out did her self with this book. I realy recomend that people read it. She has her own style that just makes you not able to put the book down.give this book a try, you wont be sorry."
3,A truly funny book.,"This book is pretty funny, I made the mistake of trying to read it wile my toddler was asleep. my laughter came real close to waking him up.The heroine reminds me of Han Solo in star wars, but female.My only objection to this book is all the fowl language. That alone almost made me quit reading it in the first chapter. Other than that it is quite entertaining, though the length of the story does not seem to warrant the high price tag. It was funny though and I will probably buy her books again."
1,Loved by cats,"I purchased this after reading all of the ""Hype"" in the advertisement. I had pretty good success with a product from Lowes but thought this would be way better. When it arrived I noticed a ""Smell"" coming from the box. Well that smell is very objectionable to me but unfortunately cats love it. The same night I sprayed it, cats came and layed on the area I had treated. The ""Smell"" was unpleasand to us, but not to the cats. Now I have to dispose of this ""Stinky"" stuff. I Called the company and they said this is the only product they have that is not guaranteed, I can see why."
1,I bought this... I won't ever again,The dogs love this stuff... it no more repels them than a can of dog food. It smells funky and I think works best at repelling people. But dogs and cats? Not!
1,"Cats Find the Smell ""Interesting""",I have tried all the odor bearing cat deterrents. All the cats find the smell interesting. After getting a nose full they move on. some were so bad they kept me away....
1,Liquid Fence for dog & cats,"I have a problem with my dog digging holes by my house. I sprayed Liquid Fence for dog and cats on the area. It didn't keep the dog out of the area. I sprayed three more times in three days and it still didn't keep the dog out of the area. Finally I dumped the remaing half quart of spray on the area and the dog still layed in the middle of it. some of the cats even joined the dog in the area. I called Liquid fence about their product and they say that it does not work for all breeds of dogs. They have a 100 percent guarantee on the spray but didn't offer to refund my money only to send me more spray that doesn't work. Their only comment was. "" We are sorry"". Don't waste your money on Liquid Fence."
3,I can't recommend this product. :(,I was using Biodefend and when it ran out I bought the Liquid Fence. I used it and the dogs just ignored it and did their business as usual. It may work on other breeds but not on the ones our neighbors own. There are no cats close so I can't say how it would work on them.
1,dog anti-repellant,"Perhaps my dog is just unique, but the ""repellant"" absolutely did not work. In fact, it attracted her even more to what we were trying to keep her away from! Sorry, but I can't recommend this product."
1,Dog Repellent???,I hate this product. It does not work and the smell permeates on your clothing. Difficult to get rid of. Leaves a bad taste in your mouth.
3,So-so Cat repellant,This spray is hard to apply and the cats come back to sniff it before setttling down in the sprayed area. The only reason this is not rated worse is once the cats get this spray on them other cats won't have anything to do with them.
2,Repells more than animals,"I purchased this product to keep my dogs from digging in the yard and trying to dig under the fence. This product has a very strong smell that does linger for a while but it doesn't keep my dogs away from the areas that I wanted them away from. I've even used it on my patio to keep the dogs from going passed a certain point, but they still cross the line, even when the product is still wet."
4,time will tell,I think this product is going to prove to be a good buy. One application is supposed to be effective for a month. I am trying it in a city garden and I also sprayed some around a small area that gets constant dog traffic in NYC. The doorman reports that all the usual suspects now avoid the area. It's too soon to determine how long it holds up after repeated rain but so far so good. There is enough in one bottle for many applications on a small area. I like that it's all natural ingredients too. I could smell it through the box when it arrived.
1,Liquid Fence for dogs,"I purchased this item in hopes of keeping our new puppy from getting into the flower beds. After using Liquid Fence, the garlic smell is horrific! It kept our puppy away from the sprayed areas but only kept her away for about 1 day. Then when we sprayed again, it also kept our friends and ourselves away. You can't stay outside in the backyard at all due to the strong garlic smell."
2,great idea!,"This product had been recommended to me, very highly, i might add..It worked with my small dog but not with the cats. I have an adult and a juvenile cat that this product has no effect on.I would not purchase this again!"
1,It attracted my neighbor's dog,"I sprayed Cat and Dog Liquid Fence on the rock ledge around the garden. I wish you could have seen it. As I was walking away, my neighbor's yappy dog went straight for the garden began sniffing all around on the rock. After several second of intense sniffing, it peed on the rock and walked away. I could have sprayed liquid bacon around my garden and got the same result.I got this product to keep the neighbor's cat from digging up my flowers so it can take a crap in my garden. It did not keep the cat out and it condinued to use my garden for its litter box."
1,Sprayer doesn't work,I can't use the product as the sprayer doesn't work. I'll have to wait for a strong person to come over and cut the bottle open so I can spread the product around.
1,Does Not Work,"I purchased this item because there has been a sudden increase of feral alley cats in my back alley, and the cats have started defecating heavily on my porch. This product does not work. I even used it in combination with theRepel II Dog & Cat Repellent, Granules, 2 lbs, but the cats continued to do about their business and chill on my porch. Neither product seems to work."
1,Didn't help,"We only had problem with cat's peeing in our sandbox. After my first application of this product, a cat pooped on the mesh netting on top of the sandbox!!!"
4,It works!,"This is the ONLY product that has stopped my Fox Terrier from chewing on the patio furniture, a little spray on the mornings and that did it! it smells really bad but who cares, as long as my dog doesn't like the smell it works for me!"
5,Great,"It is Very sturdy, yet portable. It is Exactly as advertised and arrived quickly. I am very pleased with the ramp."
4,Very Nice Ramps,I purchased the 3 foot ramps for a 2.5 inch step and it worked very well with my power wheelchair. The non-slip surface is very course and works well even when wet.
3,Singlefold ramp,For more than two steps it's a very steep incline and the illustration gave the impression that it folds and is much more portable.
3,This ramp will not work for very low thresholds!,"I ordered this ramp to make a doorway at church handicap accessible. Unfortunately, the threshold where I need the ramp is only about 1 3/4"" high. The description didn't mention the fact that the ramp is made for thresholds 3"" and higher. If your threshold is lower, the braces under the ramp hit the ground and cause the ramp to rock like a see-saw. This is not acceptable. I am returning the ramp and having to pay return shipping. I am impressed by the quality and price of the ramp, but it won't work for my application. It would be helpful if Amazon (or Prairie View Industries) would include in their description the fact that the ramp will not work for thresholds less than 3"" in height."
5,Portable Wheelchair Ramp,"I highly recommend this item for anyone who needs to transport someone in a wheel chair but does not want to build a permanent ramp system. My mother is wheel chair bound and this ramp has made it so easy to get her in and out of my house. The lip is solid and rests on the door frame. I can fold it up when not needed as well as move it from front door to garage entrace or deck. As an added bonus, it's great for wheeling heavy furniture out of the house! High quality and durable!!"
5,Surpassed my expectations,"Nowadays we're used to receiving products inferior to our expectations. That was not the case with this ramp. It is highly functional & made solid. My father-in-law came to visit on Thanksgiving & it worked great for getting his wheelchair up the 3.5"" rise from my front porch to the door. It's light enough & small enough when folded, for him to take it with him in the car. No complaints from me."
3,"Okay, but I expected more.","I have tried it and it seems to do job.It is pieced together on the supports on the bottom of the ramp.I expected single piece construction of the supports for the price I paid.It was also supposed to weigh 25 lbs. and actually weighs 33.4 lbs.I will not order anything from this company again.If I order something online from a company, I expect a good well made product.You only get one chance with me."
3,Modesty Blaise!,"Anything Modesty Blaise I love, but I like the novels better than the graphic novels. Just my taste. But be sure you know what you are ordering. This is a book of Modesty Blaise cartoons."
3,Harry Potter a Good Game but a Little Chalenging,"I am 16 this is my sisters game but I played figuring that it would be a fun, quick game to play. I was wrong. I could barely get past some of the areas. My 9 year old little sister is stuck on the second night. The challenge of this game does not match its content rating. But it is still a good game just don't approach it as a game for kids."
4,Good rental,"I rented this game a little while back, hoping for a good time. It was a good time. Great graphics, plenty of adventures, and lots of things go do. The games within the game are pretty cool. And, if your tired, just hop on your broom and fly around the grounds. However, in the long run, after you've finished the game there isn't much else to do. The game is not hard to play. Sometimes you don't really have an idea how to defeat the boss on some levels, but you eventually figure it out. The game isn't very hard though. I rented it for five days, and only got to play it for three days, and I completed the whole thing. So, for young children it might be fun, and more challenging. But, for someone more grown up it might be a bit on the boring side, and not challenging at all. I liked it but, I wouldn't buy it. It's better as a rental."
5,joeys view,"harrypotterand thechamberofsecrets is a great game! you could play qudditch,playminigames like gnometossing,and gnome dunking.and do other things like exploring hogwarts and its groundsand collect and trading famous witches and wizard cards.also you could fight bosses like the whomping willoy and the basilisk.also the graphicks are great.hermonie,ron,and harry look much better than they used to look in harry potter and the sorcerous stone for ps.the game is so fun in the game im already looking for the book foh hermonie. oh yeah remember to save 100 beans so couldby the alohorma spellbook.by the way the spells you learn are flipendo,lumos,diffendo,expelliama,incendio,and alohormora."
2,CoS review,"I had high hopes for this game. First of all, this game's storyline and scenery are dissapointing since they are not connected to the movie at all. The only positive thing about the game are the graphics and the quidditch game play. The graphics are pretty realistic and the quidditch controlling is very agile. The worst part about this game is that it is verrry short and takes about 4 to 5 full hours to complete. Dont plan to buy this game, and rent it instead."
1,Do not buy this game.,"This game is horrible, it was poorly and quickly made to reach shevles at the same time as the movie. The controls on the game are difficult, and the game is repetitive, and involves mainly running back and forth, up and down the castle. My friends little brother who is seven beat the entire game in three days and never touched it since. As a Harry Potter fan I would suggest not owning this game."
3,Just not meant to be a game,"one word sums up this game: meh.it's really hard and you can never save when you need to. In conclusion, rent it, and see how you like it."
2,ERG!,Ok i thought the first game was cool soo i got this one. It is soo not like the first game. i advise you NOT to get this! Its hard and a waste of your time
3,"Fun but definitely not an ""E"" for Everyone","My sons and I are all Harry Potter fans, and Santa brought the Chamber of Secrets game this Christmas. It was chosen over other games like Super Smash Brothers Melee because it was rated E for Everyone, rather than T for Teen. Well, after finishing the game this morning, I now realize that there's no way my 5 year old can play it unassisted... and I'm also preparing for the headaches and frustration my 9 year old will feel as he advances throughout the game. This game, while fun and lighthearted in parts, can be EXTREMELY difficult and frustrating, especially during the Incendio, Avifors, and Skurge Challenges and the encounter with Aragog. To my surprise, though, the battle with the basilisk was easy. But there were times my husband and I sat at the controls for hours trying to figure out what to do to advance (6 hours total for Aragog). Plus the game doesn't follow the book (or film) exactly, so be prepared for accuracy complaints from the kids."
2,"Just when it should be starting, it ends.","This game is OK. The graphics, controls, sounds, and challenge, are middle of the road; not great, but not terrible.The problem is it's too short. Just when the game feels like it should be starting, BOOM, final boss fight, end credits.Oh, and the final boss fight is confusing, and doesn't fit with the movie or the book."
4,Cool!,"I have a lot of fun doing this game, but I get scared at some points, like when you have to go downstairs alone, with all the ghosts and the knights that come to life when the moon shines on them...it's very scary...then at other times like daylight at Hogwarts, and Diagon Alley, I don't feel scared. Even though Harry has so MANY spells to cast, I still get scared...But I still recommend you play this game, the scary points are what make it exciting. Hope my review is helpful!"
2,"short, and boring","When i asked my parents my parents to get this game for me, i thought it would be good. I rented it and beated it in 1 day. It was way too short, and confusing. It got hard at times, but the most disapointing part of this game was, it didn't follow the book at all. In the end, i am really glad my parents never got this game for me."
4,Very well-made game,"This game was very good at some things but not so good at others-Picture(*****) They did very well at making the picture 3D, the real-looking kind of cartoon, and the characters looked like they did from the movie and it never fuzzed at any parts for me-Sound(*****) You could understand everything pretty well, and if you couldn't, they had words to follow along w/ at the bottom-Fun(****) It was fun to explore Hogwarts, play Quidditch, and go on quests, but some parts were too frustrating and hard to be fun-Length(***) This game was VERY short. My brother beat it in 2 days. If the game were longer, it would be more interesting and funOVERALL= 4.25 (4 stars)"
1,Harry Potter and the Horrible GameCube Version,"I had the Sorcerer's Stone for the PC and it was excellent then I played Chamber of Secrets for the PC and it was okay but very easy (except the broom flying challenges). I was hoping the GC version was better. Wrong...the playability is horrible. It is hard to get the camera angle to see what is in front of Harry and who wants to try to jump from one object to the next at an angle? The camera likes to show the front of Harry most of the time, so when you try to turn around to see where you are going, you usually end up getting hit by something. That is the hardest part of the game. Otherwise a two year old could play this and it could be won in about 15 minutes. Very irritating. If you've played the PC version of any of these games and are thinking of getting them for the GC - don't. All the fun stuff is gone. You will be greatly disappointed."
3,Not what I was expecting.,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I bought it to see how it is.Quidditch was the only fun I had on this game.What I didn't like:The game lagged for a while.Hufflepuff is purple and not yellow.It doesn't have most of the story plot (people petrified, no writing on the walls, etc).Not much games or time lapses.Not much is in the Chamber of Secrets (not like the book/movie).Polyjuice potion isn't like the book/movie.Overall, it is a judgement call if one wants to get this game or not."
2,Second part of the book is still a mystery,"How can one review a book half of which is difficult to follow?Perhaps the book should be renamed to ""Getting Used to Java Syntax"". The basic language elements are reasonably well presented. However, the second part of the book, which attempts to describe more advanced concepts, does not impart much understanding. I am still mystified by Exceptions and Multithreading."
5,Great book for anyone having a difficult time learning Java,"Pros probably stay away from this book. However, I've taken a Java course and the teach couldn't express Java programming concepts in clear English. Thank goodness for this book because I don't think I'd pass the course. I highly recommend this book."
3,Good content in need of a proof-reader,"I picked this book up after I got dumped in the deep end, needing to modify Java code in some NIST image processing software. The good - I could follow the examples readily - I'm 100 pages in in a couple of hours, and I'm readily learning the specifics of Java structure that I need to start modifying code.The bad - it looks like the book was mechanically spell-checked, but not grammar-checked. There are a lot of sentences, in and out of the code examples, where I just had to shake my head. One example was flat out wrong - on page 92, where the it says that an index is a number from zero to ""1 minus the maximum number of elements in the array"". This will give you a non-positive number. Not a world ender, but catching so many of these on a first skimming pass makes me a bit leery of how good the rest of the examples will be."
3,Entertaining Arrangements/Poor Singing,"The 19th Century tradition of arranging operatic favorites for chamber ensembles is charmingly represented in the two outer pieces on this disc. The modern arrangement of the overture to UN GIORNO DI REGNO for octet, and the 38 minute arrangement by Emanuele Muzio, of excerpts from LUISA MILLER for string quartet could not be more charming or appealing.The middle item, a cycle of arrangements of several of Verdi's songs for mezzo-soprano and chamber ensemble is likewise, a charmer. Unfortunately, the singer, Carola Guber, is not in good voice here. She wobbles from top to bottom. These songs need lightness, subtlety and Italianate warmth which they don't get.The instrumental playing is uniformly excellent.The sound recording is first rate. There are good liner notes and full Italian texts and translations."
4,Portrait Artist,I have used this to practice-copy his smooth complexion techniques in the romantic style. Nice plates for a lesser known portraitist.
3,"Bouguereau, A good first approach","If you want to have a first approach to Bouguereau: a va!If you want a deeper focus on this artist, look for a catalogue!About 800 paintings is too much for only a book ..."
3,I've seen better,This movie was okay. I've seen better and I've seen worst. If I had the option to see it before I bought it then I would've kept my money. They put Vanessa Williams on the cover to sell it because she wasn't even a main character.
3,Too Many Scenes Cut Out,"The only reason I got this was for my collection. If you expect to get all 3 full movies, your wrong. The first disc is the full documentary and the first movie, wich has about 10 minutes cut out. The 2nd disc is just 20 minutes of Cky2k, and 20 minutes of Cky 3, with thier scenes mixed together. I highly recomend getting the movies individualy."
3,Oh yeah...well I think this f**kin sucks! Woo da doo doo,"It is good if you aren't that big of a cky fan. It has two disks. The first disk is the greatest, it has the O.G. cky landspeed and the documentary. But then the second disk is not so good. It is a remix of cky2k and cky3, which if you saw the originals you will be very dissapointed seeing the remix. The remix is missing several of the best scenes from these movies, and it made me mad when I bought it. But its ok so buy it if you want. P.S. Haggard is the greatest movie ever, so check it out, especially if you are a big CKY fan."
4,the camp kill yourself trilogy,"i have every cky out (cky, cky2k, cky3, cky4, and the cky documentary). this is actually a great dvd. you get 2 dvds. the first dvd is the first cky (landspeed). some of the stuff got cut. the 1st dvd also also has the ENTIRE documentary. disk2 is the cky2k/cky3 remix. the intro is cky3, then some stuff from cky2k/cky3. this wasn't as good because some of the funny stuff got cut. buy it if you don't want to buy all the ckys"
2,"No, no, no.","Don't get this. Get the original CKY box set from ckystore.com on DVD while you can. Because this set only features CKY, the Documentary, CKY2K & CKY3 mixed together. A lot of scenes are missing from CKY2K and CKY3. Due to law suits and other random stuff, Bam had to re-release the CKY videos and he had to cut out some stuff. So while you can, get these great videos in their intirety at ckystore.com"
3,Misleading but still funny,"Fans of the CKY series will be pleased with the old footage on the ""Trilogy."" However, the title is rather misleading. One might think that this two-disk set has all 3 of the original CKY videos. However, CKY2K and CKY3 are ""Remixed"" together into one video, chopping many scenes from both. Beware."
1,Not all the footage,"I cant believe this would be sold and marketed as a trilogy when most of the content of 2 and 3 isnt even in it. They have been mashed together and all the good content is gone. Buy the movies individually if you want the full, awsome, cky experiance."
1,Severely Allergic Reaction,"While Afrin definitely cleared up my stuffy nose, it triggered a horrible allergic reaction in my throat. My throat felt enflamed with allergic itchiness/pain and it burned horribly. I have done other nasal sprays. Those 'tasted' bad after running down my throat, but Afrin actually caused me discomfort to the point of needing pain relievers as a result. Not sure how you would know if you were allergic to the active ingredient, so be cautious. For allergies, just take Nasalcrom."
4,gets the job done,"no compaints in regards to this product, it is comfortable for my pet, and it keeps the bugs away. what more can i say :)"
1,I want to return this because it has a cancer warning on it.,"Unfortunately I did not know about the cancer warning on this until I received it. I waited too long to return this, and now I am stuck with it. I am now using an all natural cedar spray called Evolv by Wondercide. It seems to work well, but you have to spray it on all the time."
5,Excellent choice,This flea collar is the best I have found for my dogs. I have used these for several years now. This collar does keep the fleas and ticks away. I live in the country and ticks can be a problem.
2,Irritated my dog's eyes.,"My senior pekingese's eyes suddenly got very weepy with alot of crusting from excess discharge.As she has never had this issue before,I thought it might be connected to the zodiac collar I had recently put on her.Sure enough,a day after removing this collar,all of her eye irritation ceased.In all fairness to the company,this was her first and only experience with a flea/tick collar,so she probably would have reacted that way no matter the brand.My only point is that sometimes a flea/tick collar just might be too harsh for some dogs to tolerate them!"
2,Not impressed,"Two weeks of wearing this collar and my dog still has fleas. Granted, she does not have as many as she used to, but they are still on her nevertheless."
1,Worthless For Ticks,"We've been using these collars for over a month on our two dogs. At least two or three times a week we're still finding ticks on the dogs. It's as if we didn't even have the collars on them. We don't have a problem in our area with fleas. So, I cannot comment on how effective the collars are for fleas."
2,Fleas found just a few inches away,"I have two of these my dogs which are about 10lbs. Fleas are still hanging out on the dogs on their face and body just a few inches away from the collar. No bad reactions, so the collars get one extra star."
1,didn't work,"I was told Zodiac was the best, Unfortunately it didn't do what it was supposed to, very disappointed with this"
3,So Common,Not clear of performance. I try to use it but don't see it work. But it probably will not work for my dog.You must try it for themselves.
3,Covers Galore,"This 1987 release by the Ventures puts the guitar team of Wilson, Bogle, and Edwards back together again. Here they spend all of the disc covering tunes that were popular in the `50s and `60s. The songs are strictly instrumental with the guitar taking the vocal portions of the songs. Unfortunately, there isn't anything new from The Ventures on this album, and although entertaining, it lacks in wowing.Their first cut, ""Stars On Guitars"" is a medley of all the songs they have done at one time or another throughout the years, with some licks from other popular songs thrown in for good measure. The only other surf music on the album is towards the end with ""Penetration"" and ""Surfin' & Spyin'"". Everything else is pretty much like the original song, just sung by a guitar.This album is fun, but tires quickly. It rarely gets any airplay from my collection as it seems more fit to be played in a grocery store or retail outlet."
5,A Christian classic by a heroine of the faith.,"Raw and real, this direct translation from the original Dutch is the work which served as the foundation for the later book and subsequent movie ""The Hiding Place."" It is excellent primary source material for students of World War II and essential reading for serious students of the Holocaust. Confessing Christians and nonbelievers alike will be humbled as they view the horrors of Ravensbruck through Corrie's witness. Her testimony to the power of the love of Christ will touch even the most callous hearts."
2,Don't Do It...,"...unless you want to become less of a Sinatra fan. I was too young to see this when it was released and over the years saw only a few minutes here and there when it was on TV. Always loved the theme song and figured the movie had to be as good.God almighty, was I wrong. The most charitable way to put it is that it hasn't aged well. You have Frank hamming it up, Tony Bill as one of the most annoying characters ever, and Lee J Cobb and Molly Picon overplaying their roles.The women who are involved with Frank are stupid, promiscuous, or adulterous, or a combination of all three. I'm not a big fan of alleging sexism but it was impossible to ignore it in this movie.Keep your opinion of Frank unsullied. Watch him in The Manchurian Candidate, or ever Ryan's Express, instead."
2,Hard to buy,"Sinatra, who plays the son, is 4 years younger than Cobb who plays the father. Tony Bill, who plays the kid brother is 25 years younger than Sinatra. It was all too hard to buy."
3,keep the classic rock cut the fluff :},"The old school rock forever kicks ass,the newer stuff bores me,the movie for its meaning content,the now times have {became}Yuppie,conservative and prudish,people don't really care what happens in our world,its about cell phones,Lattes,being a slave to our jobs and paranoid of B.S.,you may disagree thats the real America,but then again if you disagree you may not be aware and outraged!! Peace and deeper truths Lar"
5,tool jar A+,"Tool jar as advertised, A very good size, true color, a great price and quality. I am very happy with my purchase."
3,Good Quality,My wife thinks its good looking and that is all that matters. It is built very well and is going to be around for a while.
4,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Greatness,"Harry Potter 2 for Playstation 2 is so much better then Harry Potter 1 for playstation. Still, Harry Potter 1 is good, but if I could only pick 1 of the 2 games, it would be Harry Potter 2. And this is why Harry Potter 2 is better then the 1st 1.First of all, the 3d or digital stuff is excelent. This game has alot more digital stuff then Harry Potter 1. That is for sure. The music is magnificent. I mean MAGNIFICENT. If you had 1 tv screen with Harry Potter 1 on it and another tv screen with Harry Potter 2 on it, you would beleive me.Second of all, the game is alot more, well, practicley everything is better in Harry Potter 2 then Harry Potter 1. You can travel the school, do challenges, fly, ( on the school grounds) and do magic. Overall, this game is GREAT"
4,It is so mutch fun!,At first when I got this game for cristmas I thought it wasent going to be fun. But after I started plaing it I did'nt want to stop. So you should buy it.
2,Good Game....but short,"Take control of Harry Potter and roam the halls of Hogwarts. You learn spells by picking up books. You can assign spells to a button, and you have a Rememberall which tells you what to do next. The hardest boss in the game--for me--was the last one within the Chamber itself. Quidditch is a fun thing to do and who would say no to de-gnoming the garden?"
5,"great game, would highly reccomend",this game is very entertaining. It is not too difficult but not too hard. The only down side it it has to load often when transfering from different locations. The free and open game play gives you the options on what to do at any given time which will keep you playing for months.
3,Good but Easy!,"Ok, This game is a great game for short entertainment i was at my friends house (this being my first time playing this) and I beat it in 5 hours that is EVERYTHING i loved it for those 5 hours but after that you want to go sell it... So this game is good but does not take long to get boring."
4,The Best Actor Ever,"I loved the game because it is adventurous and I liked finding things. There are difficult parts such as going to Diagon Alley.I thought getting money from Gringotts too.(leaping over sticks relates to me a lot)Chasing Draco Malfoy was wicked sweet. They should have let me keep the rememberall because I worked for it, but it was his. That sloth brain was hidden in that trapped door, but I got in anyway.(thank god for Ron) :* :! :> (:>)"
1,It's bad don't get it i made that mistake,"This game is easy to get lost in, scary and has bad graphics."
2,"Love the serie and the book, but not the game.",If you love The Legend of Zelda this game is for you. The loading time is the problem.
4,"Great game, way better than the first!","Picked up a copy of this game for PS2, and while I can't comment on the other platforms, I can say that this game is a lot of fun.It does play similar to Legend of Zelda in that you acquire things and spells as you move through the game to help out.. lots of side games and other tasks included to give you a breather from regular gameplay and rack up points for Griffindor.The only downside to this game (and the reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars) is the frequent and lengthy load times as you move between parts of Hogwarts.. sometimes 15-20 seconds of loading for every couple minutes of moving around. A ""warp"" feature similar to Zelda would have helped out here and taken away the need to always go back and forth through frequently-used parts of the castle.Great graphics, good level of difficulty and LOTS of fun.. highly recommended!"
1,very bad game,"we bought this game and we were very excited about it but it turned out to be a huge dissapoinment!!! you would get stuck in levels and when you want to go to next level or even open a door to go inside somewhere you'll have to wait for the game to load for a while,and it's not worth $49.99 at all."
3,!,"This game is kind of good, but not really. I found a lot of cons with this game.Cons:*Most of the game is spent sneaking around at night*When you are sneaking around at night, there are prefects roaming around, and if you get caught, you start over at the door that you entered the room through (And trust me, you will get caught, A LOT)*After one class, Ron will most likely say that he's getting tired, and wants to go to bed (And it's like, 11:00 a.m.)*90% of all the tasks, are hard and boring* I couldn't get past the prefects in one part of the game (I tried everything; spells, sneaking, ect.) so I just decided to try and walk past them, AND IT WORKED (Well, that was a total waste of 2 months.).Well, buy it if you want, it is kind of a good game, but I warn you, it can be hard."
3,"Fun at first, gets repetitive later on...","At first, I never played this game, and when I finally got to playing it, I thought it was awesome. I played it for probably like 6 hours that day and 6 hours the next day. So the graphics were'nt all that great, and the loading was very slow, but it was still a very good game. After a while, it got confusing, and very hard, and since I was only 9 at the time, I gave up on it. I still can't get the stupid Hogwarts a History book."
5,Cool Game!,"It's very challenging. I love to almost kill myself and blast other people with my spells. They get mad at you. There are secret passages, and Fred and George have their own wizarding shop! I also like how people ask you to do them favors, but I don't like Diagon Alley. But my favorite thing is that you can learn new spells. And how things are so realistic."
5,WAY better then the first!,"This game really kicks butt.The only complaint I have is that its just way to short.When you have to beat the monster,its really easy.The only hard part is figureing out how to kill it.On the first one,the ending battle is VERY tough,but this is pretty easy.But after you kill it,you have to do things to earn housepoints,and those are pretty hard.Overall,this game is awesome.SOOOO much better then the first!Remember to rent before you buy!Don't spend 50 bucks and hate the game!"
