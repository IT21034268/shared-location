3,OK.. Not as light as I would like,This is an ok product... I would reccommend it above chemical dyes. I wanted to lighten my red hair... it ade it darker. The best product to use to lighten your hair is... Hydrogen Peroxide.. It works great. and it's cheap!Overall rating on this product is fair.. and worth a try if you want a few dark red highlights!
2,Not worth purchasing again,"I had ordered from this company before and the color worked pretty well even though I had purchased the wrong color. This one, NO. My hair hardly changed, and it has a sort of greenish looking tint to it (which is what color the henna was). I followed directions precisely and left it on my hair for 2 hours. It is a mess putting on and gets everywhere no matter how hard you try not to. I have used better henna than this."
3,Henna,"It worked on 2nd time. Hair looks and feels stronger, but very hard to apply. Need a lot of condition after, because it dries hair so much. I will buy it again from a local store if I have nothing else."
2,unless...,"Unless you cannot find an indian store, then it is ok. I do not like the price, it os overpriced. I found a store, I was lucky, where I was able to buy a five-pound bag and it saved me a lot of money. At least the greys fade, it is not black, but it does not matter, as long the greys hide. I have used this before, and it worked pretty good, I just don't like the price, it is overpriced compared to the regular Henna I have bought for more volume and a great price!"
5,good henna,"a bit different from standard henna, this comes with easy to use instructions, hints on how to make the color brighter or darker and plastic gloves and head wrap. easy to use and gives great color results."
4,Love Natural Hair Dye,"This henna gives my hair a great red color. It is long lasting and strong but not bright or too red. It feels so good to use natural dyes. However it is a bit tricky getting used to using heat to set the color and it doesn't lighten hair, it only colors my original dark blond to red. I have taken to using lemons to lighten my hair in order to achieve the same color as I used to get from a box."
2,Not the color I wanted..,"I tried to cancel this order like 2 minutes after I ordered it because I had gotten the wrong color. The seller emails me back, the next day, telling me I cannot because it was already being processed (even though they could have). But I decided to try this color anyways so I wouldn't of wasted my money...YEA RIGHT. I wasted my money. In my opinion this color is not what I expected. I had medium brown hair and it turned out orange...like a fiery red, sun orange. I hated it so bad I had to go to the store and pick up some different haircolor to get that crap off my head. Someone else may like it, but I sure didn't. And it didn't help the seller screwed me over."
5,Los Ep's Originales Fabulous,A must for all Raphael fans. It provides the opportunity to get a hold of the songs from those hard to get original (or ealry) LPs that may only be found in vinyl. They choose the the best songs form each LP to icorporate in the CD. My only regret is that is doesn't provide all the songs. Perhaps someone will do a retrospective of his incredible voice that will include all his work.

3,"Examining the ""Dance"" as a literary creation","Isabelle Joyau's INVESTIGATING POWELL'S ""A DANCE TO THE MUSIC OF TIME"" is a set of seven essays plus conclusion dealing with various aspects of the British author's twelve-volume masterwork. The essays are:1) The First-Person Narrator 2) Time in ""A Dance to the Music of Time"" 3) Society 4) Structure 5) Surface and Depth 6) The Abyss of Carnality and 7) The Series and its Generic AffiliationsThis is not a book for the casual reader of the ""Dance"" who just wants a guide to the action and characters, but a work of literary criticism. However, I don't think Joyau has much to say in this vein. Much of the book is the standard criticism spiel big on terminology and short on insight. An exception is the chapter ""Society"" that can help the contemporary, non-British reader understand better the world in which Jenkins moved prior to World War II."
1,Not worth your time or money.,Its synthesised not a real or even close to sounding real music box. I got the Rita Ford one and its awesome!
2,Tinny sound.,"Wish we could have listened to a sample; does NOT sound like other music box audios, such as excellent Porter ones. Has a tinny sound that, for me at least, is unpleasant."
3,Needed For School,"Required book for school.Have no feelings for it except that it helped me pass the course.Now, reselling - anyone interested?"
2,"I realize Glière's ""Ilya Murometz"" has its fans, but....","This performance of Glière's ""Ilya Murometz"" is an interminable, nearly 100-minute exercise in Late Romantic non-expression. The first hour might make for good background music, but only if one can abide a persistent drone of near-Wagnerian swelling and ebbing of massed strings -- Dramamine is not included. I realize the symphony has a program, but this might work better as a silent movie soundtrack; several grueling listens have failed to convince me otherwise.""Ilya Murometz"" has its fervent fans, but if one truly wishes to be introduced to this bloated gargantua, I'd feel comfortable in suggesting almost any other recording, apparently all of which are either appreciably amended or reinterpreted for ""listening compactness"". Farberman's recording is probably best left for cognoscenti...or for someone's extended sessions of morbid self-imposed sleep deprivation."
2,I Concur...Yuck!,"I'm a fan of LG but his voice on this CD, and the musical arrangement, is horrible! Some almost painful to listen to, by my ears at least."
1,Way Too Schmalty!,I like Lee Greenwood and I love his otther Christmas album Christmas To Christmas but this newer one is terrible! It's way to schmalty!
1,Just Terrible,Christmas to Christmas was such a great Christmas album and it's hard to even imagine anything this bad...I don't know what has happened to Lee but they could not have possibly listened to this before it was released...This is really terrible.
2,product exploded during shipment,"when i received shampoo, i guess it wasnt locked properly and half the shampoo was all over the box. so basically i paid for half a bottle. very disappointed with shipping and handling. should have been padded more and locked properly and taped.shampoo is a great product tho but way it was shipped was poor."
1,Very disappointing...,"You get what u pay for! Low quality chess pieces! Looks nice from the picture, but not very good quality when in use! Go for a similar product of Jaques of London!!!"
4,Good Read on the industry,"This book was helpful in defining all the new technologies and illustrates many challenges businesses face integrating their initiatives online.There are a lot of facets to running a business that not only must serve an online community but an offline customer base as well. Gutzman does a nice job highlighting the various sectors and the tools businesses must consider to address those needs. She provides examples and case studies. Good book, must read."
5,Good for Grandchildren,"Have grandchildren 7 and 11 years both girls that love cats. This puzzle was really alot of fun for them. The pieces were heavy cardboard, locked together good and were in many different shapes, they really enjoyed it for that reason. It was a good challenge and not overwhelming, Now they want more !!"
5,Outstanding instruction DVD!,"I have been buying and watching guitar instructional videos since 1985. Along with Larry Carlton's videos, Carl Verheyen has the most important DVD in my collection for soloing ideas. If you're tired of playing the same pentatonic box licks, THIS is what you need to break out of your rut.Carl will have you all over the neck with lines that stand out. Most videos you'll watch once and file away on the shelf as a loss of money. Not this one. I refer back to this disc constantly for ideas. Also includes a PDF file of all the lines and some live footage of his band. Highly recommended!"
3,stratjack,"Another great guitarist with an instructional video. But Carl looks at things different. He says instead of practicing scales and modes you need to come up with melodic lines, write them down and practice these until you got them cold. He divides these ideas between major, minor and dominate. A booklet(pdf) is included with examples, maybe 75 or so.I didnt count. What he does is start on a note and then jumps around using different intervals, usually wide intervals. Essentially demonstrating a compilation of licks. But make no mistake, Carl knows his scales modes and arrps. so should you if youre making sense of it all. The dvd is well produced and Carl's presentation is very good. Not bad not great."
1,No smell mostly water,"True to the title ""fragrance free"" and ""oil free"" this product is mostly water. It is very difficult to work up any lather. Save your money dilute any shampoo by 100 with water and you will be better off and save a few dollars."
2,oil free frgrance free very watery liquid,"It is oil free and fragrance free, it is very watery I washed my hair with it, I had to use quite a bit to do the job.I like the conditioner, I wish they make a product for heat protectant more importantly a frizz control treatment. PLease."
2,Watery product,"With an allergy to fragrances, even herbal and ""natural"" ones, it is very difficult to find a shampoo. Even though this is fragrance free, it is very runny and water-like. With longer hair you would have to use most of the bottle in order to feel clean."
1,Not complete,"Disappointingly, this is an abridged version, without many of the intriguing details that de Villeneuve originally included, such as fairy politics and Beauty's backstory. Not what I was looking for."
4,Beautifully Told!,I have a copy of this story and i love it. The storyline is great and it is very well written and it also has beatiful artwork to go along with the story. I enjoyed this book very very much and i recommend it to anyone who loves a good classic love story.
1,"Skims the Surface, Overpriced",Good windows simulation but has no depth in the material. You can spend your money better on a W2K reference book.
5,Don't buy used,"LabSim training software is fantastic for preparing for IT certifications. But buyers should know that LabSim software is not for resale. LabSim purchases include an activation code to unlock the software for individual use. Once that code has been used, it cannot be used by another person. So I would strongly recommend that you not purchase a used copy of LabSim on Amazon.com - it won't work for you."
4,the kite/so colorful/it flew into the stars...(song),"I thought this was an excellent book an not only a portrayal of the isolation and cruelty directed at someone who is gay but also the effect it has on that person's family. The narrator, matthew, is a likable and realistic sixth-grader, and he is not used as a shortcut--the author doesn't make him realize some great truth in an effort to end the book. Bennett's father is also a great character because we see his love for his son but also his homophobia.I thought the editorial review above (the first one) was stupid. It rushes through the entire plot line, including the end (Gee, thanks--now I don't even have to read it!) and makes the whole book sound like a stupid joke. Please ignore it."
1,BADDDDD,"I do not like this movie at all. When i first saw it on nick for the world premire, i hated it. first they show too much of that dumb patchy the pirate. and the movie is so boring. all that happens is spongebob makes decorations, gets locked in a freezer, and stays in tunnels. and the secrets are so cheezy. i would not recomend getting this movie. i would recomend getting the first spongebob movie, which is 100% better. if you were planning on getting truth or square, i would watch it on nickelodian first."
1,Bad,"As a long time supporter of SpongeBob, I was very excited to see this.But when I actually saw it, I was shocked.This was terrible- the jokes weren't funny, the plot was dry, the ending was terrible, and there was WAY too much Patchy The Pirate. All in all, skip this one. Your kids will hate it as much as you will."
2,The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie is way BETTER!,"Don't waste your money and DVR it on Nickelodeon if you need to. Too much live-action. Real actors and no Bob. My son loves Spongebob, but lost interest soon after movie started. My son is 5 and has no idea who Will Farrell is. It seems to me that if your 5-yr old likes Craig Ferguson or your kids enjoyed SpongeBob in the year 2001 and those kids are now in Jr High or High school then buy this movie. Otherwise (if your kids haven't seen it yet), stick to SpongeBob Sq Pants Movie about Shell City."
1,Bad,"Terrible. Just terrible. I normally like Patchy the Pirate, but he was terrible and should not have been in this film. Even if he wasn't with him though, I would have given this a one star. The plot and acting were terrible. And some parts made no sense. For example, Spongebob said he married Sandy, but it was just a play and even though his friends were in it, they were surprised when he said that. This movie should never have been made."
5,Nice book,Great traditional flash in it. A must have for artist and I look at it every so often. It's also has a great history to it
5,The Real Heroes of Telemark,An excellent history of The Norwegian and British destruction of the heavy water plant in Norway to prevent Germany's development of the A-bomb. Reads like prose.
4,Beginner Hikers' Lucky Find,"This book is a dream to us, beginner hikers. I find the descriptions delightful and her tips helpful. It will be a valuable resource when my husband and I travel through the state this summer."
3,"Amateurish at best, but only local guide available","I was glad to find this book, since I was looking to explore some of the hiking trails in the area. The trails are good, but I'll admit that some of them are hard for an older person like myself to accomplish. Still, I would have been completely unaware of many of the trails without this guide. Like many self-published books, the writing and ""look and feel"" of the book leave much to be desired, but the basic information is there, should you care to sift through the ""prose and poetry"" to get to it! My wife, who teaches English at a local university described the writing as ""quaint and rambling"" and typical for non-authors. I skipped it and tried to follow the routes."
5,Beautiful Single!,"Taken from the band's album masterpiece ""OK Computer"", ""No Surprises"" was one of the most beautiful singles of 1997. A melodic ballad and one of the rare songs you can listen to again, again and again.The other two songs are non-album tracks; a for B-sides they're both above average. ""Meeting in the Aisle"" is an instrumental; maybe you can say that this track gives hints to what direction Radiohead was headed after ""OK Computer"" - ( ""Kid A"" contained very few regular songs ).""Lull"" is more typical of early Radiohead; a fine song that would have fitted nicely into both ""The Bends"" or ""OK Computer"" - great vocals. My favourite non-album track though, is still ""How Can You be Sure""."
2,"3 songs total, all on OK computer",The above reviews are reviews for a different single because this single does not contain the two songs talked about in first two reviews.
1,Disappointing!,"My mistake,perhaps...Thought I was ordering a ""book""...This one is filled with empty lined pages....it is a JOURNAL...(and an ugly one,too!) haha"
4,One of my favorite devo books,"Joel Nederhood manages to cover important themes in the Christian faith, add new meaning to well-known Bible verses, and provide challenges and encouragement, all in 1 1/2 page meditations. This book is deep and pointed, but a joy to read. Even as a mature Christian, ""The Forever People"" helped me grow in my faith and live purposefully."
2,didn't learn anything new,this book is vague and uninformative. i've been testing for 10 years and wouldn't suggest this book for a novice or experienced tester. it teaches nothing.
1,Falls short of its goal,- Vague - Does not tell the reader anything new - Does not tell the reader how to test software - Not recommended for software testers...new or experienced. I have 10 years of experience in the field of commercial real world software testing.
5,Excellent at presenting a framework for testing process,"Previous reviews have given this book poor marks because it did not live up to expectations that it would provide information on ""how"" to test. Well, that's because it is not this book's purpose to do that. I found the book useful because it helped me to get my hands around the issues related to establishing testing organizations and improving the testing process. I was a software tester for 12 years, from 1987-1998, and this book helped to validate many of my opinions. It was great for giving me ammunition in the fight to establish and defend the discipline of testing within the company I work. If you too are looking to establish a better testing process, to understand why it is important to implement testing the ""right"" way, or to prepare to fight those in your organization that downplay the importance of independent testing or good testing process, this book will definitely help."
5,"Most thorough, easily understood book on software testing","I manage a large development group for a Fortune 100 company; this group includes hundreds of testers. This is the first, and only, book I found that outlines the basic, core principles of software testing as they should be applied in a fast moving, ever-changing environment such as ours. I've made this book mandatory for every one of our testers and every development and test manager in my organization."
1,Item was broken due to poor packaging from RYMATT Wellness,"This item arrive damaged due to insufficient packaging. As a result, one of the plastic connectors was smashed, thus making the bags unusable. I contaced RYMATT Wellness and received a $2 refund on a $16 order. Rather disappointing since you can't use the bags without the connectors. If I returned them, I would've had to pay for return shipping, which was as much as the product. As a result, I would not recommend ordering anything from RYMATT Wellness that needs strong packaging or contains anything that could be broken/crushed during shipping."
1,Hard to use,The zipper is difficult to seal and I'm never really sure if it is closed. Pouring from the bag is difficult. Several of the bags had a hole next to the zipper which made pouring even more difficult. I won't be purchasing these bags again.
2,"convenient, but...","I had gotten these bags to use with a rented Medela Lactina while my preemie was in the hospital. If you are pumping for a NICU baby, nurses do not like to handle the bags to transfer the milk into the volu-feeders/small hospital bottles (if you're lucky enough even to be in a breastfeeding-friendly hospital). Nurses are still handling a bodily fluid and it's extra steps for them if you're not the one handling all of the feedings. Also, the bags do not stand up on their own, which is frustrating if you're truly pumping straight into the bag. Like other reviewers, I found that the top tab tore poorly also. They are good for fast backup if you have no other sterile reusable milk storage container, but I ended up using theMedela Breastmilk Freezing & Storage (*BPA Free) 12 Pack of 80ml Bottles in Retail Packaging #87061long-term and was very happy with them."
2,Not the best,"I've used Medela Pump & Save bags since our 4-month old was born and I cannot WAIT to run out of them. They don't hold very much at all. It's labeled to hold 5+ ounces, but in reality, they barely hold 4. They're made of a thin plastic and I worry about ink contamination. They also don't lay flat easily for freezer storage."
2,Not up to snuff,"I initially went with this product as it was the same brand as the pump that I have at home and at work. The Medela bags only hold 5 ounces and trying to close them when they're full can be tricky. Also, just yesterday I was informed by my baby's daycare provider that now a third bag of milk that I had provided frozen had leaked when it was thawed. I was shown the bag and it has a crack in the bag about 3/4 of an inch long. That wasn't there when I filled the bag or put it in the freezer.I have recently switched over to the Lansinoh. They hold 6 ounces measured, but there is plenty of room for more without overflows when sealing the bag. The double ziplock is a nice feature. Also, the material that the bag is made from is softer and less brittle which I believe may have been the issue with the Medela bags."
1,Convenient but Disappointed,"These bags are very convenient when used with the pump in style however the seals are not good. I did take the time to make sure (I thought) the bags were sealed. The first 3 bags I used all leaked. Very disappointing as I do not get very much milk when I pump and it was frustrating to lose all 3 bags. Judging by the other reviews, leaking isn't uncommon. Stick with the lanisoh bags. Much better."
2,Lansinoh's are better,"These bags leak pretty often from the zipper closure and only hold 5 oz. Lansinoh's bags are a lot better, have a double zipper and are a more flexible plastic. These are a pain. don't buy them."
1,"Hard to seal, too small, and inaccurate measuring","These bags are nice in concept but fail in reality. Yes, you can pump into them, but the top will basically be open so unless you're really careful, they are easy to spill. I now just pump into bottles and pour the bottles into the bags.The zip-top seal is very hard to close tight, you'll think it's sealed but it's not, or else it pops open after you close it. I've had multiple spills and leaks because of this.If you fill the bag to the 5oz line at the top, when you freeze it the contents will expand and open the top.Also, the measurement lines on the bag are not accurate at all unless you fill the bag - in which case you don't need them. The first several times I pumped, I thought I was getting a lot more than I was...imagine my frustration when I poured the bags into a bottle and discovered I only had about 2/3 of what I thought I did.I'm going to try the Lansinoh ones next...these are not worth the price."
1,Waste of money and Breastmilk!!,These bags were a total waste of money! Medela is known for quality products so I thought by paying a little more for these bags would be more beneficial. NOT. I have defrosted several of my stored breastmilk in these bags and 5 out of 10 have leaked! Some leaked from the bottom and some from where it was zip-loc'd closed. I also purchased some Lansinoh storage bags and NONE of these have leaked. I do not recommend these bags. Save your money and your breastmilk!
1,worst bags ever,"I tried these bags thinking it would save time because I could just pump straight into the bag and then refrigerate/freeze. I wouldn't have to transfer from the bottle to the bag and wash the bottles each time I pumped. These bags are horrible.1. The bag isn't sealed during pumping. So if you actually pump close to 5oz (which is what the bag holds) and you move a little to quickly or bend just a little, milk spills out.2. The bags don't close easily. There's no indicator to ensure that the bag has closed properly - so again, there's a risk of spillage.3. The bags don't lay completely flat the way Mother's Own Milk bags or the Lansinoh style bags do. I like to lay the bags flat when freezing so that I can stack the bags in a ziploc to keep them organized by date. These bags freeze in a bulky shape so they can't be stacked neatly.4. The way the bags are designed - it's hard to pour the milk out of the bags into a bottle without spilling.I recommend staying away from these bags."
1,WORST EVER,"I hate these bags. If you have to pump, breast milk becomes so precious and wasting a drop is painful. The idea is great - especially for using at work. But they do not seal well. Every time I have used them they have leaked - they just dont close well. I love the Lansinoh bags, i wish i could pump directly into them."
1,Not worth the money,"As many others have stated these are great in theory, but poorly executed. The plastic of the bag itself is very stiff and tears easily. The seal is awful. Hard to close and leaks. This is especially frustrating when you are trying to use this for convenience at work or to transport milk elsewhere. I haven't even bothered to try and freeze milk in the bags because I was too worried about the bag tipping and leaking all over the freezer. The lansanoh bags are much better. I have even taken the tabs off the medela bags to use on the lansanoh bags. Don't waste your money on these bags. It ends up costing you more in time and lost milk! Plus the Lansanoh bags are cheaper!"
1,Bad-smelling milk,"These bags are convenient to pump into, but that's where the pros end. It's difficult to get an accurate measure of how much milk is in the bag unless you measure it and pour it into the bag. Even worse, and the reason I won't buy this brand bag again, is that defrosted milk smells (and presumably tastes) TERRIBLE! It smells like plastic. I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to my child. Anyone who has sat hooked to a breast pump for what amounts to HOURS to later have to throw that milk away can empathize with my disgust over having the storage bags ruin milk. Go with Gerber bags or Lansinoh. I never had this issue with those."
2,Better than bottles but not by much,"I bought this product to limit the number of bottles I would need to purchase. The bags aren't as easy to use as I hoped. I have to press the 'seal' a handful of times to make sure it's completely closed. When the bag is reopened, it's cumbersome to get milk out without tearing the bag completely or spilling the contents. The measuring on the bags is an approximate measurement (as stated on the bags) and that's the last thing you want to think about during the middle of the night when you're either filling the bags or trying to reopen them. Overall, the product is better and cheaper than using bottles but still needs vastly improved in price and functionality."
3,Avoid the new product,"I loved the older version of this product (the one that is pictured here and has a yellow swirl on the front). it works great!! it was easy to use, never leaked. The new version of the product has a major issue with the ziplock aspect of it. They made it skinnier and it doesn't seal as well. Look for the old boxes."
2,"Don't lie flat, only single ziploc","The little tape tab that lets you pump directly into the bag is cool. However, the bags don't lie very flat in the freezer, which becomes an issue when you are building up a little stockpile. Also the single, clear ziploc zipper is not enough. I've had milk leak because the zipper didn't close all the way. Much prefer the Lansinoh bags."
2,Does what its suppose to but messy!,I loved the idea of pumping straight into a storage bag. It ended up being a mess! I'll continue with my old system of pumping into the Medela 80ml tube bottles. If I know I will be freezing the milk I'll pour it from the tube to Lansinoh storage bags. I recommend those bags over the Medelas.
3,Meh.,"These are easier to write on with pen than the Lansinoh bags, which is nice, and it is handy to pump straight into them, but I prefer the Lansinoh ones. These are small, and the plastic seems weaker. Also, when I tear the top off, it rips into the writing area every. single. time. and it just drives me crazy. I'll stick with the cheaper Lansinoh bags, thank you."
1,LEAKS!!!!!,"I usually don't write reviews, but I am compelled to voice my opinion on this particular product. I usually sing the praises of Medela products. However, these pump and save bags are terrible!!!! I have an entire freezer full of stored milk; all of which are sealed in these bags. Now that I am back to work, I have had to defrost several bags at a time...daily. Without question, there is ALWAYS 1 bag that is leaking. The leaks are usually not from the zip top, rather, it has burst along one of the the seams. I only fill the bags with 2-4 ounces, allowing for adequate expansion when the milk freezes; trying to ensure the best I can that the bags won't burst open...and still I am finding leaks.For all of you breastfeeding moms, we all know that breast milk is ""liquid gold"" and we have to work SO HARD to produce it. It pains me to see even an ounce of milk wasted in such a manner. Don't waste your money on this!!!!"
1,Dont waste your money,I find these bags almost impossible to work with. The collar to pump directly into the bags is hard to work with. The holes in the bag for the collar to fit into also make pouring the milk into a bottle a messy fiasco. The best way to pour the milk is to use scissors to cut the top of the bag off. I found that these bags are hard to tell when they are zipped closed too. If you do use these bags don't bother pumping directly into bag just use nipple shield to pour milk into bag after pumping.
1,Not great for freezing,"The bags state ""safe and long-term breastmilk storage"" but the milk I pumped and froze last week is nasty. I use most of the milk I pump to make my son's rice cereal as he has started solids. After he refused his food multiple times I tasted the cereal and it was nasty! I pulled another bag out of the freezer from 3 days ago and it smelled and tasted the same with his cereal. Now I use the milk I express in the morning for that day only. Disappointing I cannot use these bage for the intended ""long-term"" use and stay ahead with my pumping."
2,Misleading ad,"I'd buy more of these bags if the ad weren't so confusing that it's unclear what I'm actually ordering. The photo shown at the top displays the easy-connect bags, yet the photos in the Product Description section show the self-sticking tape bags. Also, the ad indicates both 50ct and 20ct in different places. What EXACTLY is being sold here?"
1,"Terrible! Leaks, leaks, and more leaks!","These bags are awful and in my experience, after they are in the fridge, leak more than 50% of the time and, if they put in the freezer, leak more than 80% of the time. Yuck! The Lansinoh bags are wonderful--get those instead!"
3,hard to zip,"It takes a lot of strength to close the zip. Sometimes you think it is closed but it is NOT! And when you try to store the breast milk, it leaks! It happened to me a few times already!"
3,"Too Pricey, but they Work","These are handy if you plan on freezing breast milk. If you are just storing some in the fridge for use within a couple days, use the plastic containers. They are easier, cheaper, and reusable. There are cheaper bags out there, the Lansinoh ones are just as good. I don't understand why the Medela bags are so much more expensive. I never tried to pump directly into the bag, so I can't comment on that."
2,Do you like to spill milk?,"Can't someone engineer a pouring system for these bags? It's such a hassle to poor the milk from the flabby plastic bag into a bottle without spilling some and nearly impossible if you are stuck with your infant in one arm and need to do this one-handed. For the price, Medela should really come up with something better."
3,Dispite the cost I keep buying them,These bags have not leaked on me at all. I use a hygeia pump and with the adapters and converters these bags are great to be able to pump directly into the bag to save the number of transfer times of the milk to preserve the nutritional value. They are expensive but I find that the convenience outweighs the cost. I agree with some of the other users that it would be nice if they were slightly bigger but I have just used a second bag as well. I also think they could package them up without the adapters for less cost once you have a set or two. I will continue to buy them despite my qualms out of shear convenience.
3,Making a switch,"My Baby is 6 months old and I have use these bags since she was born. I had tried a few other bags that someone gave me, but liked these the best until the most recent ""upgrade"" or change that Medela made. Basically, they made an effort to accomodate the freestyle pump (which I have)and now include these plastic adaptors that fasten into some holes on the top of the bag. Hate it. I'd rather pump into the bottle and dump it into a bag without the holes. you have to finagle the plastic adaptor into the wholes and then once the bag is full, its tricky to get out-and then its possible to spill it. I had at some point wished that I could pump right into a bag, but I often have to pump 6 oz at once and that is impossible b/c the bag is only 5 oz, then the added component of the plastic adaptor in the holes make it a complete nightmare. No thanks. I will be making a switch. Total bummer. I really liked them before."
1,don't bother.,"I put this on my baby registry and recieved a box as part of a gift. This is my first experience with any Medela product. The plastic used for these bags is stiff and the measurements are off. Not to mention the bags only hold 5 ozs. Since the plastic is so stiff, I have torn through several, right down to the seal, rendering them useless. Thank goodness I didn't purchase these because I would have been highly upset. I considered giving the remainder of the box to a friend of mine, but I would not wish these bags on anyone! Awesome idea in theory but Medela has a long way to go in order to get this concept working correctly. Save your sanity and buy anything else!"
2,Beware of leak issues,Received a 20 pk of these in the medela breast milk storage gift set and in testing a bag out with water before I used them for milk I opened my freezer midway in the freeze process to find the entire bottom shelf covered in ice cold water. When I held it over the sink the dripping continued even though I looked to make sure it was sealed. After trying a few more bags I saw the only way to prevent the leaking was to store the bag standing upright which will not work as I need to be able to store them flat in the freezer. Also I did notice this bag does not lie as flat as the Lasinoh bags so while this product may work for some people I really don't feel confident in even using the ones left in my box. As someone who will be returning to work full time I do not have the luxury of losing precious frozen supply due to bag storage leaks.
3,Pricey,"Save some $$ and buy the NUK/Gerber bags. These bags are fine but too expensive. If you want them because they attach to the pump, fine, but you can use regular tape or hold the bag in between the funnel and connector."
3,very cheaply made,I'm not a big fan they ere inexpensive n I love my medela breast pump so I thought I would love these too but that is far from the case. I hate that I have waisted so much milk since the bags tear easily n during thawing out I would see there was a leak. Really recommend lanosh bags they r bigger n more reliable
2,I liked the old ones for 2010-2011 better!,"I have been a Medela pump and accessories user for now my 3rd baby. I really dislike the new design with the attachment so you can pump directly into bag. I don't like to pump into the bag because the measurement is inaccurate. So I pump into a bottle then pour it in. The problem is that now there are these huge holes on the sides of the bag above the zipper to attach the thing to hook onto your breastshield, so its impossible to pour milk in without spilling it everywhere! The old ones had perforations to tear off the top part if you don't want to pump directly into bag, not sure why they couldn't do that with this design too. I haven't yet poured any milk out of the bags yet but I'm sure it will be just as messy as getting it into the dang bag. Why doesn't medela first make the measurements more accurate and second try pouring milk in and out of it before they agree a new design works. For the first time I am buying different brand storage bag!"
3,Old Style,"These are the old style pump and save bags with the sticky tab that attaches the bag to the valve. My fault for not reading through the product description, but, now I know there is a difference. New version is much better as the bags hang on an adapter that is included in each box of pump and save bags you buy."
3,"Good for freezing, but don't bother pumping into them","These bags are good for freezer storage, as they are compact and hold enough for about two feedings for a newborn. However, the little attachment clip for hooking to the breast-pump is clumsy, and allows for leaks. We gave up trying to pump straight into the bags after a few attempts because of the leaks.Again, the bags for freezer storage are fine, but you won't save any time trying to pump right into these. It's just too messy."
1,New pump and save is not convenient.,"I had a very difficult time with these bags and went as far as emailing the manufacturer directly.""Pump and Save"" to save time was nothing more than a time waster. I prefer to pump directly into a bottle because the measurements are much more accurate.When you transfer from a bottle to the bag most of the time the milk spills out of cut out they use for the pump attachment.This was a terrible design fail and have since discontinued use of the Medela bags."
3,Not as good as I had hoped for,"I found these bags to be hard to tear straight on the perforation. Also, they have a very small area to write on. They do stand up and seal well and are pretty easy to attach to the breast shields. I was using the Medela bottles to pump in and then putting it into the Gerber storage bags. I thought it would be easier to pump straight into the bag while at work, but later realized that pumping straight into the bag does not allow you to get an accurate measurement of how much milk you have pumped. So, I am back to pumping into the bottles and then using these bags for storage. I think I will just buy the cheaper Gerber bags when these are gone."
1,"Leaky, save your money!","These are absolutely terrible bags. I bought them to bring on a business trip as I didn't want to have to bring bottles (too bulky) and in theory, could pump directly into these bags to save any losses in transfer. Well, that turned out to be a terrible idea! I would estimate that at least 3 out of 4 bags leaked, and this was after I went over and over the seal to avoid just such a thing from happening. This meant there was milk all over my pump bag but even worse, that I lost that milk! Any pumping mother knows the pain of losing milk! Then I had to go through TSA with leaky bags and hope it wasn't an issue (it wasn't but still pretty embarrassing.) The only positive about these bags was that you could pump directly into them using the included adapters, but they are not worth that convenience. (I much prefer the Honeysuckle bags but can't figure out how to pump into them directly.)"
1,These bags leak - terrible seal,"I have only been using these bags for about a week, and have had several leaks already. I went to the Amazon reviews to see if it was just me, and I'm glad to know it's not. I agree with what everyone else has said - the zipper seal is terrible. I am a big fan of Medela's other products, which is why I tried these in the first place. I had been using the Lansinoh bags, and will definitely go back to them. I'm not even going to use the rest of the package - I just can't bear to waste precious milk because they leak."
1,more parts to sterilize,The old bags were so much better and more convenient! The seal on these is lousy and the extra parts just cause another sterilizing problem in btwn pumping at work!
4,Great,"Good product, only thing I don't like is the ounces aren't marked true to volume. The bag barely holds 5 ounces."
3,Does what it's supposed to,"This product is fine, does what it's supposed to (hold milk). I never had any spillage but I do wish it had a double zipper like some other brands (Lanisoh). Just would have made me feel less anxious about possible spills. Also I don't feel like the oz count was accurate. You could have like 2 oz of milk in there and easily interpret it as 3 or 4 based on the markings on the outside. But again, those are just little complaints because all in all it did what it's supposed to do."
3,Useful,"I'm glad these fit right onto my breast pump. They are expensive, though, so when I'm at home, not work, I use the Lansinoh bags. They have held up just fine in my freezer."
3,Expensive,I use Medela breastmilk bag in the first but later when milk production increases Lansinoh becomes my favorite. Lansinoh can hold more milk and it has double seal.
3,Has an adapter,"I thought I was purchasing regular bags, with an easy strap to tape directly to breast pump, but no. It has an adapter, and the bag has a couple of holes to hook the adapter, and when I pour milk to freeze, I have to be very careful cause it will spill. My advice: if you are just pumping directly to the bag, probably will work. If you pump in containers and then use them to freeze, you will have a tad of a problem. I will be using them, but not gonna purchase them again."
1,Cheap quality,The bags are poor quality and poor construction. Lansinoh bags are much better and recommended.
2,pump bags,"In theory, these bags would have been great. However, I actually found that I didn't like them at all. I prefer the Lansinoh brand. The piece that connects the bag to the pump tears through the label area when you try to tear it off. And it holds less milk. This bag holds a maximum of 5 ounces, and is then REALLY difficult to close, whereas the Lansinoh brand holds 6 ounces and closes rather easily. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Medela pumps better than any other pump, but I would go with a different storage bag."
1,Terrible design and they leak,"THis new design with the holes is ridiculous. If you forget they have holes on the sides you can easily unintentionally spill all your hard-pumped, precious milk.Medela bags are thin so they break easily. Freeze them and count on them leaking when you defrost the milk.Get Simplisse. It's the best bag out there."
3,"Kind of a Waste, But Still Useable","I do not use these bags to pump milk directly into. I don't find that method easy or convenient at all. I am always terrified of milk spilling or something falling into the bag while pumping. With that being said, I still purchase these bags because I can't seem to find 50-count Medela bags WITHOUT the adapter on Amazon. I prefer the thickness of the Medela over the flimsiness of the Lansinoh (I had soooo many frozen bags get holes in them). If this is the only way to buy them on here, then so be it. I give this product 3 stars because it seems like a waste of plastic to me (I just throw the adapters away), but the bags are great for milk storage."
1,horrible.,"First of all, it says that liquids could get trapped in the plastic zip part which could prevent it from closing properly. is this a disclaimer for crappy product design? the product stores milk. Kind of asinine if you ask me.Second of all, when you are pouring the milk out, sometimes it leaks out the crease where the plastic zip is, creating a dribble effect two inches below the top; which if you're pouring into a medela bottle, you'll lose milk. Again, horrible design/quality.Thirdly, we've lost a few bags of milk b/c the zip isn't strong enough to hold the milk if it's full. We make sure that it's zipped tight but if there is liquid within the zips, it'll pop open. Now how do you clean out the zips when it's a mm wide? Asisine - poor design.Luckily we've only lost a few oz here and there since the crappy design has forced us to double baggie the bags with zip loc bags. which kind of defeats the purpose of using these bags made to store milk."
1,Do not buy these bags,"I am on my way home from a business trip and my cooler is filled with spilled milk. These bags leak, do not hold enough milk and the seal sucks. Very disappointed at the quality."
5,works great!,"I love these bags! I had read other reviews saying they were difficult to use but with the new adapter hook and the new design of the bags I think they are really easy to use. I also read that people didn't like the zipper. I don't know what they're talking about. Sure you can't just pinch it at one end and run your finger to the opposite end. You have to take the time to pinch it all the way down, but what's the big deal about that? I think it has a really good strong hold and I have NEVER had any problems with milk spilling."
2,Unreliable Zipper Closures,"I thought I would love being able to store milk in a bag and lay it flat in the freezer to save room. However, there are a few flaws with this product 1. The ounces it reads while it's in the bag is about one ounce short of what is actually in the bag. To make sure I know exactly how much milk I'm leaving for my baby, I will pump into a bottle and then transfer it to the bag. 2. The ziploc part of the bag does not always close completely, no matter how many times you try, so when you try to lay the bag down, milk gushes out everywhere. Very frustrating!!!Medela Pump & Save Breastmilk Bags - 50 pack"
5,Research Homework Guru,Great product that works well either infrig or freezer. My wide loves all Medela for the quality and ease of use. I support Amazon for customer service and free 2 day prime shipping!
4,Medela changed the attachment mechanism.,"Note - these are no longer bags that strap over the pump, as shown in the image. Medela has changed them to include an attachment that screws onto the pump and then you hang the bag from that (yet another piece to wash). You can still have leakage from the bag if you're not paying attention and lean forward, etc.On the plus side, storing milk in these bags in the fridge helps with our baby's upset stomach, because less air gets into the bag when you're mixing it back up versus mixing it in a bottle (best seems to be to mix with the bag still closed). They also heat up very quickly, which is good when you have a hungry crying baby. Because of this, we've switched from storing in bottles to storing in these bags, even though it's about $15 a month (~2 bags a day), it's worth it to have our kiddo be less fussy with the bottle feedings."
2,too many faults with these storage bags,"Make sure you seal the bag tight after filling it to avoid spills. Also, you have to open them really gently at first as so not to tear the hole that fits on the piece that attaches to the pump. Lastly, the measurements are not very accurate. When I fill a bag to the 5 ounce line, it's only about 4 ounces."
2,Convenient to use but horrible to store,I got these for my wife to use when she pumps at work. They are good for the convenience of getting set up quickly but the bags themselves are horrible for storage. Most let the milk leak out. They don't hold that much either and my wife said trying to change those things while in the middle of pumping was a pain in the behind
2,Crying over Spilled Milk,"I decided to buy Medela bags because I have their pump and I trusted the brand name. Unfortunately, these bags didn't live up to my expectations. They are small, making it difficult to pour milk into them without spilling. The pump attachments work fine, but it's difficult to juggle the horns and the bags at the same time, and there's no way to set them down without spilling, especially if you're pumping both sides at the same time. Finally the zip-lock is terribly unreliable. I can't tell you how often I set down a bag that was ""sealed"", only to have it dump over and leak. These bags have been very frustrating to use."
5,"So Far, So GOOD!","I am a new mom who is trying to build a milk supply before I head back to work. I pump several times a day and have managed to nurse and set aside eight to twelve ounces, thanks to this product. I can freeze the bag standing up, then lay in down to stack the milk in my freezer. THIS PRODUCT HAS MADE ME FEEL SO GOOD! I know that I can have an ample ""system"" as a working mother, no matter where or who watches my daughter. Life is good!"
1,These bags are a pain,"I love the Medela Pump and Save bags, but these bags (with the adapter) are terrible. It is extremely difficult to pour the milk out after you defrost it because of the hole at the top (and because the top of the bag is much longer than the previous bags. It is also difficult to pour the milk into the bag if the bag isn't hooked up to the pump. I don't have a Medela pump, but I have liked their breastmilk bags much better than the Lansinoh bags. Maybe they would work better if you have a Medela pump and can hook the bag right up to the pump - though the accuracy of the amount on the bags has never been quite right. Either way, I do not recommend these bags and am hoping Medela continues to offer the bags that don't include the adapter."
1,Nice idea in theory,"These bags are a nice idea in theory but have many flaws:1) The measurement is only approximate, which if you're a pumping mom, is annoying.2) The zipper-closure is AWFUL. I hurt my fingers nearly every time I try to close each bag and it is nearly impossible to squeeze the extra air out of the bag before closing. Even when closed all the way, milk can still leak most of the time.3) The bags are difficult to get on and off the adapter. It takes twisting and turning just the right way and the first time I tried, I broke a bag.4) They are FAR too expensive to be this problematic.Do yourself a favor and just stick to the Lansinoh bags...they are the best."
1,Milk smelled horrible after defrosting,"I stored some in the freezer for when I go back to work. After only two weeks in the freezer, I defrosted one to see how easily things would go, needless to say, after warming it up, the smell was horrific. I had some Lanisoh bags and I defrosted one of those, much better. If you end up with this box, I would not suggest freezing, store in the fridge with the four day rule then toss."
5,PERFECT,THIS PRODUCT IS PERFECT FOR ALL WORKS MOTHERS. I USE EVERY DAY AND MY BABY HAS A MILK WHEN SHE NEED.
1,Do not buy these under any circumstances,"These are the worst possible version of this product available. They tear when you try to open them, they don't stand up properly, the markings are useless for approximating the volume of milk, and trying to pour milk back out of them is more painful than giving birth all over again. Avoid these like the plague!"
2,Good idea but not great in reality,"The bags are nice in that they cut out the middle man for freezing, but the oz measurement is off by about 2 oz and they spill easily."
1,Hated these bags!,"These bags were a waste of money! I HATED them. I only bought them because they say you can pump directly into them. Well, it's not that easy to do that. I tried it once and didn't like it. I prefer to just pump into a bottle and then pour it into the bags. It's so much easier. And for just plain milk storage the bags didn't seal well so they leaked. Also, I like to store my milk flat so they defrost faster. These bags don't lay flat. I have switched to Dr. Brown's bags. They are much better. I've never had any issues with leaking.Other Medela products are great but this one missed the mark BIG TIME!"
4,New Bags!,"I bought these storage bags when I ran out of the ones I receives as a gift. These are slightly modified and now come with an adapter to hold the bags (as opposed to the old sticky straps). They're easy to open/close, but I find it hard to pour milk out of the bags into a bottle the way the instructions tells you too."
2,"Great Idea, Poor Design","I've never been a huge fan of Medela products because Lansinoh is just as good and a lot less expensive. However, I grabbed these bags because I pump at work and being able to pump directly into bags would save the time. I was horribly wrong. Cleaning up spilled milk takes longer than transferring to bags from bottles. These are really awkward to use if you only have two hands (which I'm pretty sure most, if not all nursing moms do). The seals are really finicky and I'm always scared the bags are going to bust open in my pump bag on the way home from work. I've also had issues with the holes for the attachment ""hooks"" ripping. Add in the limited space for milk (5 oz as opposed to Lansinoh's 6oz bags with room to spare) and the milk that gets above the zipper seal while you're pumping (even with a Pump In Style), and these are just a bad product. I bought two boxes of Lansinoh bags today and I'll never try to switch brands again!"
2,The bag leaks,"Beware. The bags are expensive compared to other bags. I have had problems with leakage when I thaw milk. Also, it's hard to pour milk out of the bag. I'm disappointed in this product"
1,Clearly not designed by nursing moms,"These bags sound like a great idea but I found them to be next to useless. They work fine when you're pumping, but they are hard to close so that all of the air gets out of them. The Lansinoh bags are much easier in this regard, and have a double seal at the top. The pump and save bags don't lie flat in the freezer, so they take up much more space. And they're designed terribly in terms of pouring the defrosted milk out of the bag - you have to pour along the side seam, but because the top is curved, you lose some of the milk as you're pouring. As a result, they don't save any time or clean up hassle. I find it easier to pump into bottles and use the Lansinoh bags."
2,A good effort,"This is a wonderful effort by a young writer. When I purchased this novel to use for my thesis on adolescent lit, I didn't realize it was published by a vanity publisher (or I most certainly would not have bought it). The first few pages were well written and edited, but then the punctuation and grammar went down hill. Weinstein does a great job of showing how homophobia has infiltrated America's middle schools. The story was interesting, yet incomplete. I understand this is part of a trilogy or series, but it really is not finished--there's far too much of a cliff hanger."
1,don't waste your money or your time,"I read prose for the enjoyment of the reading. I read every word and I don't skip to the end to find out how the story comes out. This book was a singular exception. Boring, at least 3 times too long, more concerned with a pointless love triangle than with Mars. I only finished it by skimming, stopping every four or five pages to read the few paragraphs necessary to follow what little plot there was. Unless you're into existential philosopy, the ending is a total joke. The descriptions of Mars surface geology are interesting, but that's about it. Stephen King could probably turned this into a good short story."
1,400 + pages of nothingness,"I just finished this book. Honestly, it was the worst book I've ever read. Absolutely nothing happens. The character development somehow manages to stay flat even as the author writes ream after ream. The only redeeming aspect (which is why it deserves one star) is the perspective it provides on the social development of makind (and human romantic relationships) in the context of liberating our socio-biological history. Beyond that the book is a waste of time."
1,An overratedexercise in intellectual wheel spinning.,"I had great hopes for this book when I ordered it but it was avast disappointment. Three quarters of the novel is a tedious buildup. Finally, after the love triangles and pointless maunderings on human nature the reader feels that he has arrived at the meat of the story only to reach the end crying: ""Where's the beef?"" The ending is unsatisfying, to say the least. Maybe Arthur Clarke liked it because it is a direct steal from 'The Sentinel' only less upbeat. The author seems to have written the ending in the midst of a fit of depression."
2,"Lots of potential, not much payoff...","Hartmann has a nice, comfortable prose-style that makes for a relaxed, enjoyable read; unfortunately, though, this story never really takes off. The mystery is developed nicely (if a bit too slowly), but doesn't have quite enough of a payoff. A banal love triangle slows things down unnecessarily, while many of the characters remain mere thumbnail sketches, without much life breathed into them. What really prevents the tale from working, however, is Hartmann's almost complete lack of description of the Martian landscape, of the human habitats, of the characters, etc. In a tale like this, if the author's storytelling doesn't make you feel as though you're on an alien world, he isn't doing his job. I read tales set on Mars in order to be transported there, to have the planet brought to life for me. This tale didn't really even try to do that. Too bad."
4,A great introduction to dance rhythms,"I guarantee your feet won't be still! For more than forty years Ella Jenkins has brought traditional music of all kinds to children and adults. This is a reissue of the historic 1977 recording celebrating all forms of dance - a tribute to Ella's own childhood fascination with music, rhythm and movement. It features 21 tracks of spirituals, chants, blues, and folk songs, plus 9 interview segments with members of Chicago's dance community, including a choreographer and Afro-Cuban dance specialist, a dance therapist and a dance student."
4,Interesting for being Goosebumps.,"This wasn't the cream of the crop in Goosebumps episodes, but these 3 episodes were okay. I may be wrong, but these 3 episodes were never actually books, at least in the original Goosebumps book series. It shows in the layout of these episodes. There's just that feel that these were ""made for TV."" In any event, they're worth a watch if you're into Goosebumps. Also, if you're interested, please email me at pwherman@gmail.com for information on obtaining a complete 7 DVD-set of Goosebumps episodes."
5,the secret of skull mountain,This is the best Hardy Boys book I've ever read. It is full of action and it is exciting. If you like Hardy Boys books you better read The Secret of Skull Mountain. It is the best of the 17 Hardy Boys books I have ever read.
3,Dated,The story was ok in it's day (50's). Some of the words used are obsolete and dated. My grandson did not like the story because of this. There are better choices out there.
2,"Shocking, but ultimately unsatisfying","*SPOILERS*This movie centers around despairing situations and how a group of people face these challenges. It sounds really good on paper to me, but this movie was too depressing for me. There was some sort of plot, but it did not flow or connect together, which really left me unsatisfied at the end of the movie. It's just scenes and scenes of depressing material that I could have done without. I'm not against gore, horror, suspense, and depressing human conditions, but I really did not need to watch two hours of it and end up getting nothing from this movie."
4,Tragedies bring the worst in people.,"The reviewers seem to be divided on this film.Me? I liked it very much.The story takes place in an underground bunker after a nuclear attack on NYC. The survivors are locked inside. We have the man who built the underground shelter (Michael Biehn) and the many people he is sheltering. The film shows how the group easily slips into several conflicts turning the shelter into an underground hell of abuse, violence and murder.The actors are first rate - so are the sets, the direction, the makeup and the soundtrack.But to me, the script could be slightly come compelling if the film did not focus so much on the violence. It is strange that some characters start immediately to act like they are in a street brawl. And the progression of time is not very clear: I did not get how long they spent down there (or how long their ordeal took).I recommend this film to anyone who likes the genre. It's miles above the average.I liked it. :-)"
5,Dark apocalyptic tale,"I loved this and have no idea why the reviews are so negative. Without giving anything away, it tells a tale of how a group of survivors might eventually act after they're thrown together to survive an apocalyptic event. Things go downhill and we are privy to madness, cruelty and survival. Although it is a dark movie, I loved it and thought it was a very private look into a psychological meltdown."
1,A Waste!,"Don't even waste your time viewing the trailer. And the people who producedthis should be locked up for bad taste and horrible movie ideas.The acting, the cast, everything with this movie was horrible.I seriously want my money back for renting this trash."
2,A rather bad view of people,"I confess I did not like this story. It is marketed as a horror story, but I think a drama would be a better description.What it is, is an unrelated small group of people manage to get in time into an atomic bomb shelter during a nuclear blast. The original plan is to wait out the nuclear blast. However, they get locked in by some scavengers and more importantly a few start to go crazy. I hope it is not a real image of people as I like to think in times of extreme danger people come together and do not go crazy like, for example, miners trapped in a mine or inmates in German Death camps. Overall, I think the story starts off very good, half way I was really enjoying it, but then it drifted off into pointlessness.The characterizations itself are reasonable. The acting is good.The filming and special effects are reasonable for such a movie.I would, however, not see it again nor do I recommend it, mainly because I do not like the story."
3,Decent movie,"I thought this was a decent film. I would have liked to see some more insight about the military personnel or who ever they were and a bit more about the ending.Otherwise, there were some good characters and this film really depicts what happens to people in isolation when supplies are running low."
2,Went too far,"We were enjoying this movie for about the first 45 minutes and then it just took a drastic turn and become a heaping pile of unrealistic and sadistic crap. It wasn't about surviving, it was about S&M, rape, torture and it went too far. It ruined what until then was a decent movie. Not award material, but still interesting. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking when she took this role? Is she that hard up for cash that she would take a degrading role like this? Slight spoiler regarding her role...her daughter gets taken and how does she respond instead of trying to get her back? Starts rotating on some man meat and willingly gets abused and no one does anything to stop it. If you, like us, got this because you like post-apocalyptic type movies, you'll be disappointed in this one because that is very little of the story line. Almost the entire movie takes place in one bunker-type location and there is no focus on survival besides rationing water and can goods."
3,its ok,"I saw this movie on demand. I expected a doomsday sort of movie with strong character development due to the isolation. I also expected plenty of disturbing scenes which this movie delivers. However the story is weighed down in what i can only classify as bad writing, bad acting, or bad improvisation. The director of this picture wanted improvisation which hurt this movie. The acting was so wooden its as if the actors were at a loss for words. The director also wanted to keep the camera off the actors so they would actually be pissed at one another. Why? Actors get paid to ACT. Let the actors ACT. This movie needed a solid script and solid direction. The divide could have been better in the hands of a better director."
1,it's just....WRONG!,"Why would anyone go to so much effort to make such a good looking man (Milo Ventimiglia)look monstrous? Michael Biehn also had to have his good looks turned into a grizzled mess. This could have been a very different movie, if you ladies know what I mean hehe. Even the wimpy foreign guy was pleasing to the eye when he wasn't crying like a lost puppy. Other than the eye candy, it was depressing, dark, and seemed meaningless. Nothing original or creative, just the standard rape-to-death sicko fantasy world for guys that want society to end. This movie played like someone gave a basic outline and the rest was impromptu, without anyone knowing or caring how it ends or any of the details along the way. The characters were all very flawed or very weak, or both. Would not watch again, would not recommend."
1,stunk,This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen and I've seen lots of crappy movies. Approximately 30 minutes into the movie I was ready for it to end. The movie suck stunk and I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone!
2,foolish,I like Michael B. but not sure if me watching it was more foolish than the movie itself. Did like the very end though.
1,Horrible!!!,"seems like it my go somewhere....but it never does. sad, depressing, disgusting. I thought w/ some bigger name actors for this sort of movies it might be ok. i was wrong. a lot of questions gone unanswered, and a horrible plot line. And I watched the whole thing :)"
1,see Blindness or The Road...,This movie was utter garbage...directed by Xavier Gems and he did Frontier(s) and Hitman. Those are WAY better than this...the actual filming of it was crappy too. It was like he used a home video camera and shot a bunch of people going crazy. nothing important happens and they all die at the end for no reason! HATED IT!!!!! I love his other movies but cant stand this one!!! DONT SEE IT!
5,I thought I would take a chance!,"I saw the cover of this dvd and read some of the reviews. Ok! Thee are many, many post A-bomb movies filled with zombies, gouls and other so-called monsters that are supposed to caused by the blast. In this movie there are none of these. This movie is just about regular people and what they become when trappedin a fall-out shelter. What happends is that the people trapped become the ""monsters"". The movie is around2 hours, but it goes by in a flash. I am not going to tell you what happends in the end! You will have to see this gem yourself. All I am going to say that is that the final scene left me with a pit in my stomache!"
1,Disturbing and Sad!,"I feel that this movie is very DISTURBING! And if you want to have anxiety and feel depressed, then this movie is for you! It's very graphic and eerie! It just shows how people who don't have any faith in God whatsoever would behave during an apocalyptic event!"
2,Promising concept but poorly made film,"Take a nuclear attack, add the scared residents of an apartment building. Lock them in a basement and add paranoia, sex and lots of violence and you have The Divide. I liked the idea of this film and thought it had a lot of promise. Unfortunately that is not the film we have here. There seems to be no point or reason to this film. Things seem to happen just to happen. Not to further the story. And there is not a likeable character in this film. I suggest skipping this film and watching something better like Take Shelter."
1,disgusting,"I undestand the message of helplessnes, human depravity and nature, but the film carried it too far, too unrealistic to the point of beint very disgusting. I am throwing the video away. some of the actions taken by the actors was unrealistic, even considering human depravity. It had no social redeeming value whatsoever. I am a movie collector and have some sense of realism, social values and human nature, but this film ultimately has no value to be transmitted to the viewer."
3,A horrifying and disturbing look at what a group of strangers do after the apocolypse. Not bad but very disturbing. I say B-.,"""This ain't exactly the garden of Eden."" After a nuclear bomb is dropped and earth is uninhabitable a group of tenants of an apartment are forced to live together in the basement of the building. What starts off as a tense situation quickly explodes into something much, much worse and everyone's views of each other change. This is not what I was expecting. I thought this would be more of a Sci-Fi type movie and what it was was a very disturbing look at what different people will do when pushed to the edge. For those that have seen the movie ""Blindness"" you will know what to expect. For those that haven't be warned, this is a very, very disturbing look at the human condition and makes you wonder what you would do in this situation. Overall, more disturbing then anything. Not bad, but you must be ready for what you will see. I give it a B-."
3,EXTREME,"worst case scenario,worst reactions,surprise endingit makes you take a second look at your neighborsnot a bad movie but,would have preferred a closer tomiddle of the road approach,my boyfriend didn't likeit,to many extremes"
4,This is a very disturbing but well done movie,From the perspective of what the produces wanted to convey I think this movie did it. It certainly portrayed what might happen in a post nuclear situation. I found it very disturbing and I am sure that is what it was meant to be. The acting was well done and the dialog realistic. I can only say that it is not for the faint at heart. I am not a fan of this type movie because they seem to be very depressing and this was but it kept my interest nonetheless. I wanted to turn it off yet I didn't. If you are someone that likes really intense apocalyptic movies this one is a good one to watch.
4,Not for everyone but a gritty movie,"I only rented this movie because it was $1 somewhere else, but much to my surprise I ended up liking it.Now, you are definitely not going to get any warm and fuzzy feelings while watching this film. Parts of it are dark and very sad, but it's not gory. Oh bad stuff does happen, but at least the movie does not show every gruesome detail. In fact, I'm not sure why this film is categorized as ""horror."" Drama or sci-fi drama would be more fitting.There are a few twists and turns that I definitely did not expect, which made the plot interesting. While there are several holes in the story and I found myself wanting to wring the neck of a few of the characters, the film is not simply a remake of something we've seen before. It won't win any oscars, but it's a great psychological thriller. A sort of Lord of the Flies in the aftermath of an undefined attack that takes place in the basement apartment of a crazy building supervisor.The scenario makes for a pretty good flick."
4,a very uncomfortable watch,"This movie shocked me in some ways. It surely will stir your emotions and stay with you long after it's over. Talk about slow descent into madness... The ending is especially well-done in my opinion. If for nothing else, the score is worth listening to. Recommended if you are into apocalyptic films. Blu-ray only has a commentary and trailer of the film."
2,Don't buy,"I watched this movie when it first arrived. Really didn't know anything about it except what I had read in reviews. Movie did not make any sense to me. I know it will get pretty ugly when and if something goes wrong in our country ( EMP, Nuclear Attack, etc) but this one was way over the top. This movie was not believable in any way, the characters were all over the place in personalities and actions. I would not waste my money. Heck, you can even have my copy....."
2,Grim,"This is one of the grimmest movies that I have ever seen. It starts out bad and only gets worse as time goes by. If you ever thought that the end of the world might not seem so bad, watch this and you will save the last round for yourself."
2,Save your money,"I did not buy this thru Amazon. I should have come here first though to see what the reviews were. I had hoped for a film about the apocolypse, but this one is more of porn and violence than anything else. There is a definite decline into madness by each character represented in this tale with absolutely no hope of a future. Gives one the sense of such hopelessness that if this ever occurs, one would be better off killing oneself, immediately, rather than going through any length of survival."
4,Great Movie,"I liked this movie, but it took a while to get into, and the end made me mad, but I eventually watch the whole movie and it is fine."
4,Good watch,This movie was over hyped to me by someone as the most horrible thing they had ever seen and I had to see it. It was a good movie but more at times I found myself getting mad at the characters for being so dumb.
3,Interesting movie,"This movie stated out with great promise, strangers who flee to a highrise buildings basement after an atomic bomb is set off in their city.You get to see human behaviour at it's best and worst during a crisis.I gave the show only three stars ( average ) because how the show de-evolved and the poor ending however you may like it better.Worth seeing if you cannot find something else to watch on tv."
3,People at their very worst,"A mother turns into an amusement for two deranged men, a man won't share his huge stock of food and drink, and the others try to eke out a bleak existence after nuclear war devastates the U.S.Some scenes are very hard to watch as these people degenerate further and further into monsters engaged in horrible behavior underground.Pure existential horror."
1,Awful stupid pointless movie to waste your time,"I can't really thing of any aspect of this movie that is worthy of positive note. I love the end of the world kind of movies, and since Michael Biehn (sp?) is in this movie I thought it might be fun to watch ... I actually rented it online. What a dog of a movie. If you want to see something with the idea of this movie, watch ""Lord Of The Flies"" because that is all that happens here, the people in the movie degenerate into rapists, murderers, insanity - not to mention stupid. This is already many multiples more words than this piece of garbage deserves .... 1/5 - AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE."
3,Divided,"The ending could have been better explaining the white soldiers? Rescuers? Scientists? or whoever they were. You would have seen plastic tunnels everywhere when she got out. I guess my stars will be ""divided"" for this reason."
4,self study,This was an excellent purchase for home study high school material. Please remember like books their are minor mistakes sometimes that get by the reviewers. We would suggest purchasing the Middle School material and the Elementary School material depending on your students knowledge levels. The student can always review the earlier material.
1,A Collection of Readings,"There are a few useful nuggets in this book, but by and large it is a collection of disconnected articles, papers, and such produced by the ICI, the SEC, and other authors. It resembles a book of readings assembled by a lazy professor for his college course (which it actually is). One could get most of the value found in this collection simply by pulling the articles from the SEC and ICI web sites, at a much lower cost."
4,good intro to mutual fund investing and management co.'s,"A good introduction to the issues confronting mutual fund investors and management companies. Each chapter consists of a collection of articles written by various authors, all pertaining to a particular topic. One criticism is the inclusion of a few government documents that are virtually impossible to read unless you are a Fidelity lawyer. The case studies at the end of each chapter are not graduate level material but do provide some thought-provoking material. Part IV can be skipped without missing anything vital.Mr. Pozen does an adequate job of staying impartial despite his position at Fidelity.Recommended reading for anyone getting started as a mutual fund investor or looking to increase his or her knowledge of the industry."
2,Like watching paint dry,"Pozen is the man ... Bob revived Fidelity from its post-Peter Lynch slump and bridged the gap between Ned and Abbey; really admirable.And Fidelity, of course, is the company ... the genius creation of a single man that changed the course of financial history and helped the United States achieve worldwide financial dominance.... but, I am very sorry to report, this is not the book.I have lived in this industry for my whole career; I am passionately interested in the whole field, so I come to this book with great anticipation; unrequited.It will sit, unread, on your shelf because it is, simply, dull."
1,Dry as dust and just as entertaining,"You don't buy a mutual fund book expecting excitement, but this book is dull even for a text. It's a series of disjointed lectures and pieces that, cobbled together, might have made for an interesting class when you could interact with the author. In this format, it's dry and boring. It's certainly not for the average guy looking to learn about funds and the fund business (it talks over that person's head), but it's little more than a refresher for anyone who is knowledgeable about funds."
4,Great starting place,"We bought this book because we had heard bits of information about permaculture and we didn't want to spend heaps of money learning about something which might not interest us.Earth User's Guide to Permaculture has inspired us to get into permaculture in a big way. The information presented gives enough in the way of ideas to get the brain ticking over and to think how it can be applied in your own situation. We will buy another, more detailed book than this one, but this was perfect as an introduction to permaculture and to guide us in the direction we need to go.I'd recommend this book to anyone with an interest in permaculture who isn't sure if it's for them. There's enough to get you thinking and to let you know if permaculture is for you."
4,LIBRA/MUSICA PAROLE,"DAM GOOD!!!!!!!HOWEVER,I WISH I COULD BUY IT IN THE ENGLISH VERSION.OUTSIDE OF THAT,ITS GREAT!!!!!!!!!"
5,I found this to be an entertaining and well written book.,"The characters in this book are so beautifully crafted, it's hard to remember that these are not real people. Anyone who has spent time in the South should have memories of encounters or observations of real versions of John Warren, Corey Stokes or the sleazy Ned Worthington. This is a book I wished would not end so I could continue reading about these fascinating people and their lives. It's obvious that this book was written from the heart which is a gift to all of us."
5,Mr. Rhodes writes beautiful poetry as well as a great story!,"Yes, this is a really good story about the horrors of war and loss and death and life lived with courage and love. But, the real joy for me was the Christ figure in the character of Grey Hampton. The Journal writings from the character of Grey Hampton are filled with the cycles of place and time,coupled with the ebb and flow of human fortunes. Certainly a book that is worth reading and passing on to others. A book that is gifted to honor life by the main characters living fully, loving wastefully, and daring to be all that each of them had the capacity to be. Thankyou Mr Rhodes"
4,I am now a much better putter,"I am putting much better since reading this book. Previously, I read Stan Utley's book and I could not get my putts on line. I am now putting everything where I aim. The only thing I did not like is the commercialism of the book. Pelz tries hard to get you to buy his practice equptment."
2,disappointing,"I've watched Dave Pelz on the golf channel and took some of his chipping tips to the practice green where they really helped. I expected as much from this book. Unfortunately most of the practice methods in this book require using Pelz' special practice equipment and therefore aren't very helpful unless you have these items. There is some interesting info on the lack of consistency in how a golf ball rolls, but other than that I didn't get much out of this book. I certainly didn't need to read this to know that taking several hundred practice putts a week will make you a better putter, and that is the bottom line."
4,Not a book for the clueless,"The book does imbue one with a sense of moral responsibility towards the wild spirit of Earth. There are still some wildplaces left on the North American continent, but not for long if everyone goes there. Read about the areas, and help them stay wild."
3,Not as good as the original,Take one old (great) book and put a liberal spin on it. That is what you get. All the tree-huggers will love this one.
2,Good info...bad presentation,"I gave this a 2 only because the information in it is good. The problem is, it's basically a narration of a PowerPoint presentation. If it were under $10 I might not feel so bad about buying it. But for $24.95, I feel like I WAY overspent for it."
3,Is George singing in a well????,"Crank the volume up because the output is low compared to most discs. Flatten the bass because it's recorded way too high. Grossly over-produced and George sounds like he's at the bottom of a 200 foot well. That's the bad news. In spite of everything, this is not a bad album musically. The selections are very good notably, 'Father Figure' and 'One Last Chance'. Even with newer technology since this album was recorded, his voice still takes a back seat as you'll notice in his duet with Elton John on 'Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me'."
4,This is one of my favorite CDs,"I bought this the year it came out, after seeing George in concert and it is great! Most of these were big hit songs and I found that I really loved the others too especially Hard Day."
4,Pretty Good,"I just purchased this and although I am glad I did, based on the comments I thought a DVD was also included. I only have 2 CD's. Not sure how to purchase the DVD versions."
4,Good background music,Like to have this on in the background while in the kitchen.Nice to relax to. Can dance to it but very mello. But not sure if i'd call it romantic at all.
5,Top Five album of the 80's,"One of the best things about ""Faith"" is how surprisingly well it holds up today. If I'm a producer I'm getting someone like Justin Timberlake in the studio today to do a cover of ""Hard day"". Not that Timberlake can hold a candle to Michael vocally, musically, or in any talent capacity, but that song would be a hit for him today if he did it, no question. This album to me is very underappreciated by history. It's easily one of the best from the 80's and to me one of the best pop albums of all time. I was 11 when this came out and I love it as much today as I did then. It doesn't get the credit it deserves as an outstanding achievement in pop music."
4,Classic CD!!,"This is one of George Michael's best works ever. Songs like ""Hard Day"" and ""Monkey"", and of course ""I Want Your Sex"" make this CD a classic. I recommend it for all George Michael fans and fans of '80's music."
4,Listen Without Prejudice!,"Folks, what is the complaint about this finely crafted album? It's easy listening stuff, not hard rock; and it doesn't pretend to be. It's emotive, well produced, and catchy. I can see where critics fell over each other trying to pin George with apeing other rock music styles (see Amazon's review, above)...but that's a comment on the genesis of the songs, not on their inate quality...which is abundant."
5,Great sound!,This was purchased for my daughter who recently starting becoming a George Michael fan and now plays this everyday!
4,Extra disc,The extra disc is a pleasant bonus for those hungry for any George Michael 80s music - several tunes I wish would've been on the US edition of Faith.
3,Disappointment,not worth the $$$. music was basically a repeat of original. 2nd CD totally no value. the original videos are the only reason to buy this collection.
4,Faith,Faith by George Michael before he went crazy. The album is good and was done in a time when George Michael had it together. he hasn't put anything worth crap in a long time and his personel life is going down hill. A good album for someone with so much talent. Too bad he's not back in the saddle and doing more work on something he's good at and at one time enjoyed.
3,"Good, But Could Be Better","I'm not really an audio expert,so to me the remastered sound was a warm welcome atleast over the original cd. This entire reissue would've sounded even better with the 7"" mix of I Want Your Sex instead of Monkey (Acapella),the Monogamy Mix of I Want Your Sex instead of Faith (Inst.)and the Aretha Franklin duet I Knew You Were Waiting For Me. Then pretty much we would have the definitive 2cd version of Faith !"
4,Still great after all these years,"The music and CD are still great, the only thing that was a turn off is the fact that CD #1 couldn't be read by my laptop and I couldn't download it to my iPod, apart from that everything else was great."
2,Not too good...,"I really hate almost everything about this CD, but I really like ""Kissing A Fool"" alot."
2,Where did it all go wrong?,"Considering he was one half of the excellent Wham! great things were expected from Mr Michael when he went solo. Unfortunately the pressure must have got to him as this album is a disaster. Fans of classics such as Wham Rap, Bad Boys and Club Tropicana Drinks Are Free will be bitterly disappointed. It seems obvious to me that Andrew Ridgeley had been carrying Mr Michael for years!"
5,THE BEST ALBUM EVER,"George Michael's first solo album, Faith, is a brilliant collection of ballads mixed with some higher tempo pop songs. Everything you could ask for out of an album is in Faith. Whether your in a depressed or upbeat mood their is a song that can inspire you. In my personal opinion this is George Michael's greatest work. And it gets 5 stars any day."
1,Out of the Loo,"This is pre-bathroom escapades GM at his finest - the first in an endless string of one word album titles, that are sure to bring a tear to the eye and smile to the lips - of nobody!"
5,Husband loves it,"This supplement does something magical to my husband. He has far more energy and it helps his circulation, in all areas. I would suggest this to men that may be having less energy or loss of libido. We ran out and his old problem came back until the bottle from Amazon came. Took about a week of taking it and he was back on track. I loved what this was doing for him so I started taking it and I can't see that it has done anything for me. Maybe this works best on men or women with low drive."
2,Packaging Unacceptable but Product works,The package arrived with the seal on the inside of the container broken and open. The pills are quite large but are easier to swallow than the chalk type. If taken an hour in advance there is a descernable difference in your weight lifting output. Slightly more reps are achievable. The affect is more noticible if I am lifting on a day that I am fatigued. It gives you the little extra you need to get through the tough routine day.
3,Year of the Knee,I've recently had surgery to re-attach the patellar tendon to the patella. I thought it would be a good idea to use this supplement to help with gaining strength/mass back into my quad's. I haven't been disappointed.
4,Satisfied,"I was delighted to receive my book within a few days of ordering. The book looks new on the cover and overall in great shape, however, the previous owner made several notes and markings on several pages and that really bothered me. Its condition should not have marked ""New""."
3,Ok product,Ok but I will not order again. Sizes seem to be off. Body area is too tight and sleeves are too long.
5,just what I ordered,I needed lonng sleece undershirts of a 50/50 blend. Locatd in a flash and delivered as I expected
3,A must see for Nick Lea fans!,"I am a huge fan of Nick Lea so, even though this film is formulaic and silly, it's worth watching just for Nick. He's very good and *so* adorable! He shows a real talent for comedy and it was nice to see the lighter side of his incredible acting ability. I must admit that if Nick weren't in it, I would not buy it, but if you're a Nicknik, it'll be a great addition to your collection :)"
3,The Raffle,"This movie would have been 4 stars, except for the song, ""Over You, "" by Timmy-T. The inclusion of this song in the soundtrack really degraded the credibility of the movie as a whole. The song was so annoying that I almost couldn't watch the movie, which was great of course. Mark Hamill, Nick Lea, everyone and everything was fantastic, except for that song. Man. Maybe they could re-release it with some instrumental synthesiser music instead. Other than that, It was worth the rental. Three Stars!(Almost 4!)"
1,Does NOT work with PS2two!,"Do not be fooled by the packaging! The packaging has a sticker on it which clearly states ""Now Compatible with: PS2two"". However, I bought this item and took it home only to find out otherwise. Yes, the multitap does succesfully read all four controllers and the memory card; it does act and do its function perfectly... However, at the same time, it completely degrades the audio quality; audio is at a low volume is full of static. Even more so, I can not even turn on my PS2two with this multitap plugged in, the PS2two will turn on and then immediately turn itself off within a second. I have never been happy with any Pelican products, but I was forced to buy this one since Gamestop refuses to carry the official Sony line of adaptors. It is my feeling that Pelican did not test this product for PS2twos, they simply changed the design a bit so that it fit into the PS2two controller/memory port and called it a day. Do not buy this product if you have a new Slimline PS2two."
1,Does NOT work with *new* PStwo!!,"Just as a data point to back up another reviewer, this Pelican Multi-Tap did NOT work with my new ( as in, bought it October 2006 ) Slimline PStwo, despite a very clear label indicating that it now supports that model. In fact, it doesn't work *at all*. The PStwo either doesn't turn on at all, or it stays on, doesn't turn off, and doesn't do anything- no game load, no system browser, *nothing*.It looks like Pelican has discontinued the product ( I couldn't find it on their website ), and there is a clear reason. Don't buy this if you have a Slimline PStwo, period!"
2,Buyer Beware!,"It didn't work for all of my PS2 games that supported multitap. I have the PS2 slim version, and I found that I have to unplug and replug the multitap to get 4 players to work for Hot Shots Golf Fore, and it just didn't work at all for Smash Court Pro Tournament 2. I'm probably not going to buy any other multiplayer games for the PS2 from now on."
3,6-24x40 Bushnell 716244,"I have had this scope mounted on a 270. I have had problem keeping the 0 for windage. Recently I was teaching my wife and two other ladies How to shoot. I have them shooting 1 1/2 inch groups at 200 yds. I reload my own amo it realy helps with the grouping. I moved the windage off 0 and told Cortiny to 0 the wepon. When she attempted to remone the turret cap the turret came off the scope. I sent it in to Bushnell they sent me a letter stating the damage was not covered by warranty and also stated I could send in $132.40 AND THEY WOULD REPLACE IT. I looked on AMAZON and found the scope NEW for $109.00. Bushnell makes a great product but like other comments I think the Bushnell scopes should be used on small caliber rifles. I have 23 rifles on 12 of them I have bushnell scopes the scopes mounted on the 270, 30-60 and 7mm mag have been sent in for repair. I am not putting Bushnell down, the scopes are great for the price but I need something for bigger cal."
5,had to give this 5 stars,"what more could one expect for that price? actually surpassed all expectations, it is an overall good scope just buy some covers and decent mounts and your good to go."
4,Very nice for small investment,"Quality packing and shipped very quickly. This scope is awesome. I mounted it up to my .17 hmr and zeroed it in within minutes at 200yd. The clarity even at close range is perfect. If you're looking at variables for under 250 this one is the best ive seen.The one issue I've had; when it arrived there was something in the lense, a black hair it seemed like, small enough not to bother me and since then (12 months) firing it with my .17 hmr and now on my .270 must have jarred it loose so no longer there. Still awesome and the simple lense coves make it easy to keep nice.If you're thinking about this scope, do it. I'd be just as comfortable buying another as i would be a nikon."
5,Very good.,"This scope is very good, i had no problems whit it. It was deliver fast and after mounted on the rifle, it was just pure fun!!!"
3,Banner 6-24x40,"I purchased this scope to place on my Howa 1500. It is a nice, clear scope for the money. The only negative I have with the scope is the elevation turret. After placing the scope in the new mount, I wanted to bore sight the rifle, but when i went to take off the turret cap from the elevation turret, the cap had somehow been stuck to the turret, which resulted with the turret being removed completely from it's mount inside the scope's tube."
3,Is something missing?,Just a note to say the DVD runs around 70 minutes not 90 as mentioned on Amazon and also the cover of the DVD. Funny that the people issuing a product are so sloppy as to not know how long it is or is this just misrepresentation? Perhaps it has been slashed.
2,Pass on by...,"Get a Life is an independent film from 2006 of mixed quality. The story was okay, in a way it seemed a critique of the bar & sexual hunting lifestyle...except that the main character was in it up to his neck by compulsively going to the bookstore backroom. The acting seemed like the producer got some friends together to do the movie. These two qualities would have been forgivable if the production values were any better. Obviously shot directly on a video camera of some sort giving it a totally amateur feel that stressed the faults of the acting & writing.I'm giving this movie a 2 only because the ending was an unexpectedly upbeat turn...I won't say positive, but definitely upbeat."
1,"Get a Life? No, Get a Clue - don't bother with this!!!!","Oh my God - this is just AWFUL. Don't even bother. The men are blah, the acting is double blah and the story is...well I don't really know because it is so crappy. Don't believe the blurb in the product info. There are no fascinating men or colourful people - mostly ugly and not sexy doesn't count does it? Too bad to give any more detail. HATED it, rated it as low as I could go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,The worst movie ever put to tape,"We rented this movie, thank god. We had to shut it off after 20 minutes because it was THAT bad. It came off as a bunch of friends who drunkenly decided to ad lib their way through inside jokes and every desperate cliche they could muster. I find it implausible that anyone who wasn't in the cast, on the crew, or related to someone who was involved would give this dreck more than one star. There was absolutely nothing redeeming about it."
3,"Great color, but different script/ voiceover from original","Nice to see this Steve Reeves classic in the original WIDESCREEN format. Very colorful images. Unfortunately, this version had different voice personalities. The original version had more punch to every line. Hercules delivers his lines very weakly and all the characters speak in more simple modern English phraseology."
1,WARNING: WIDESCREEN VHS IS NOT ORIGINAL DUB!,"Maybe it's my fault for not knowing, but then again finding proper info on the different versions of this movie sure aint easy. I thought for sure the vhs which Amazon lists as a 2003 release would certainly have had the original dub where Hercules has the deep baratone voice. But NOOOO! It turns out it's the international dub, which is no fun to watch. Plus the picture quality is very dark and washed out. OH by the power of the gods of Olympus is their a Hercules in widescreen with original dub on either VHS or DVD?"
5,"When it comes to Greek Mythology...The cheesier, THE BETTER!!!","And when it comes to cheesy, Steve Reeves is VELVEETA BABY!!! Through the ages...and by that I mean the time between THIS movie and that series starring Kevin Sorbo...Hercules movies and or series have been Kraft macaroni and Hercucheese!!!Hear is the catch...You have to watch these movies with gouda on the mind and realize the reason they are so great is because they are so OVER DRAMATIC!!! If these movies where remade today they would be Spiderman blockbusters guaranteed.Own this movie and watch it with friends when you are ""In the right frame of mind..."""
1,good value,"very poor sound and picture quality. It is so bad that makes it hard to understand, but good value and brings back great childhood memories. If this is the first time you watching them, almost intolerable quality."
1,Hercules,"My review is not about the movie, that would be a high 'camp' 5. The quality of the DVD is what gets my complaint. The studio that claims this has been ""remastered"" and has digital sound is selling a lie. BUYER BEWARE!"
4,"the ""original"" Hercules","This was my first cinematic exposure to Hercules(Heracles)when I was a child.To me,Steve Reeves will always be Hercules.OK,so the picture quality isn't that great(it was,after all,made in Italy in the late '50's)and the acting leaves much to be desired,still it's a fun movie with some exciting scenes.Yes, the dubbed voice-overs are a bit corney,and the story isn't the true mythological one but I liked it anyway.(One reviewer liked that Hercules prayed to Jupiter instead of Zeus feeling it more accurate-he must have been a Roman).To me this was a much better film than the 80's version with Lou Ferrigno despite bigger budgets."
3,Cloak & Sandal,Hercules is the original cloak and sandal epic. Steve Reeves is excellent as the musclebound hero who goes through many ordeals for the woman he loves. Great fun.
1,HERCULES,"In its day when the movie was released in the states, it was quite a colossal impression on a pre teen to see one of the heroes bigger than life on the big screen. I was very disappointed in the poor quality of the copy of a copy. Great memories though..."
3,I enjoyed it.,"Although there's nothing extraordinary about the storyline or special effects, I've always enjoyed this movie. Steve Reeves is still my favorite Hercules. Most of the story is centered around the same basic theme as Jason and the Argonauts but with Reeves in the starring role I could watch it again and again."
2,boring,"I got this primarily from nostalgia, I remember watching Hercules movies on the noon matinee when I was home from school sick. But it was not one of the ones that I remember and didn't have many great feats of strength like you would expect from a Herc' movie. I think I will resist the temptation to get any more Hercules movies, this satisfied me that my 12 year old remembrances of how great they were are not to be relied upon - too often true of these old movies. I don't mind the inferior special effects, I think it might be the lower production values, often poor acting, poor script & story-line that I was less mindful of when I was a kid."
1,False Advertising RIP OFFS,"They advertised an indoor outdoor fountain 37"" high slate and with lights. They sent me a whale that hooks to a waterhose that measure about an 1 1/2 plastic a piece of junk. Tried to contact them but off course no answer. I think that Amazon should not allow them to sell. I see that they have done this to several people bait and switch."
1,whale faucet,This was a complete waste of money. I tried it one day and threw it in the trash. Price not worth the effort to return. Water sprayed all over. Cumbersome and messy to use. Cheap piece of plastic.
3,Nice for awhile or for light use,"These look great initially, but if you keep them on a keychain you regularly use they will break on you. The type of plastic they are made from is very brittle. I've had every single one fail on me within 1-2 months of daily use... the holes where the ring goes through starts to chip away and eventually fall off. It's a shame because I use a barcode system to keep track of my keys and the large size and clear plastic made scanning easy."
1,Clear but not tinted as in picture,"The picture that is in the ad clearly shows one purple and one blue tag--while clear, they were tinted. However, what I received was a group of key tags that had no tint on them at all. Very disappointed. Had the picture been representative of what I received, I would not have ordered them. I wanted ones of different colors as I was supplementing an existing method of organizing keys where I work."
4,Very good pusher shovel. Clears snow right down to the pavement.,"I clear several driveways in a very snowy area of Salt Lake City, Utah. Needed a pusher shovel that would conform to the surface and leave no snow behind. Shovels with a metal edge just don't clean any but the most even surfaces. This shovel really meets my needs! Excellent blade durability so far (a couple months of moderate use). My only complaint is the blade to handle connection is a little loose and allows the blade to wobblea bit."
1,Too brief and outdated!,It was a mistake to buy this book because it neither gave me any detailed and insider information nor it is updated in the last few years in order to use the addresses and telephone numbers in my applying. As you see I am very reasonably disappointed.
2,Not very bad,"I personally expected and needed a lot more than just a good overview of this topic. She has succeeded to include all important sub-topics such as job descriptions, cruise line profiles, addresses directory and application writing. However each of them is long only few, small pages and provides only a brief summary."
4,Good Resource,"Mrs. Osseenfort supplied a good knowledge of cruise ship life and the workings of cruise ship employers. The only drawback is that some of the provided cruise line addresses and phone numbers were out of date. I managed to read the entire book in about an hour, but found it very usefull."
5,Cruise Ship Jobs,"....""Cruise Ship Jobs"" by Cynthia Ossenfort is the most accurate guide for people who are looking to work on a cruise ship. Her extended background in the industry, her on board experience, make this book a winner... Well done Cynthia."
4,Tres Sweet,"Tres Chicas is a the alternative-country answer to the Thorns, an all-female ""supergroup"" consisting of Caitlin Cary, Tonya Lamm & Lynn Blakey of Whiskeytown, Hazeldine and Glory Foundation respectively. Those groups bubbled under the radar with their critically respected, no commercial sales music. Sweetwater will probably follow the same sales fate, but it will garner the same critical praise. The songs have a down home feel to them, with soft harmonies and acoustic touches like a mandolin and stand up bass. The trio does amp it up in spots like on the title track, ""Heartbeat"" and especially on a cover of Loretta Lynn's ""Deep As Your Pocket"" which features a spirited vocal interplay and fuzz-toned guitar riff. Sweetwater is a smooth and breezy listen and worth checking out."
2,"Too many characters, too little development","This title of this book is misleading in that the titular character is absent for the majority of the book, and his relationship with the main female character remains a mystery despite hints. Obviously something happened between the two of them, but it is never explained. Annie seems like a caricature, as does Jeanine. There are just too many questions in this book, like Annie's mystery illness that comes and goes and seems simply like a handy plot device. I was disappointed with this entry in the House of Winslow series."
2,I bought SEVERAL of these on a recommendation...disappointed,"This book of oldies was really for beginners on piano. There wasn't much more than the melodies. SEVERAL songs were abbreviated significantly (missing intros, shortened intros or significantly changed). After this seemed to be the NORM in this book, I stopped looking.I do NOT recommend this collection."
3,Really easy to use,"I do not know how to play the piano, but with this i can play all the tunes in this book. The only problem is these are old tunes the book is outdated. I wish they would make another one with new tunes."
5,Was there,"Bought this book on a whim when I was in Lake Tahoe over the summer. Purchased it at the Red Hut Diner.The Red Hut Diner is where Owen McKenna, the main character eats at . Food is great by the way. Saw many of the places that Todd Borg mentions in his books.Ended up buying the whole series at Amazon. Hope he continues writing more."
4,A Good Read,"""Last Wish"" is the true story of the author, Betty Rollin's mother, a health concerned and loving woman in her mid seventies. Betty tells the story of her mothers experience after being diagnosed with ovarian cander and her own experience being related to someone with cancer. This book shoes the hardships of cancer, chemotherepy, and assisted suicide on both the cancer patients and their friends and familys. Betty Rollin does a wonderfull job telling her story with great emotion and truth. I recommend this to anyone suffering with cancer, being close to someone with cancer, interested in or researching cancer."
2,"A wonderful tribute to Betty's mother, but a little depressing to the rest of us.","Betty's first book, First You Cry, tells of her own battle with breast cancer. This one tells of her mother's battle with ovarian cancer.As any daughter would want to do for her mother, this book plays a magnificent, loving tribute to a dying woman. However, I just could not get into the book. Maybe it was because I, too, have cancer (breast cancer,) but this book to me was depressing, long-winded and did not hold my interest. It was a chore to flip each page. The story could have been told in a few chapters. While the events are, without doubt, signicant to the family, they were rather predictable and uneventful to the reader. I respect the author's compassion for her dying mother, but the book did not stand out as a literary work of art."
5,Focus on all aspects of family,"I was so moved by the poems in this collection. Because of his obvious knowledge of the Chinese language, he brought forth poems that I would never have had access to before. Having experienced the birth of a child and the loss of the loved one in the same year, it was a wonderful experience to read the poems relating to those life changes. It is so wonderful to read poems compiled by an author who values family!Janice Johnson"
5,Wonderful,This book is full of such sweet and simple thoughts about life. It made me cry sometimes and smile other times. The author's information about the poet made me feel more connected to these enduring poems. It's a fabulous read!
4,Big Jim's Left hand,"I found out about James P. Johnnson just recently and I'm a senior. Wow! This album has better sound than some others and a real long serious number which was later orchestrated. Johnson's playing is pure magic, as Duke Ellington says, and if you play piano yourself, you must hear his left hand! Never too much or too little, always supportive of the top line and always just right. Maybe I'm just in the first flush of enthusiasm about this guys stuff, but this makes me want a time machine. I'da like to ah bin there."
3,hoe old are these,if u are jewish u have heard or seen 90% of these jokes and if u are not u have heard 50%. it has historical value as it holds a great many of the classics
2,Interesting but some recipes contain meat!!,"I would have given this book 3 stars for the tips the author gives, but everything else is just 2 stars or less. A book titled ""Healing Tonics"" gives you the impression that it's all about healing drinks containing herbs, fresh fruit & vegetables. Unfortunately some recipes contain meat (chicken, oysters) and some other products that I don't believe contribute to a healthful life in any way (butter, etc). Although those items were not in the author's recipes, they were in recipes from her contributors (other herbalists). If I had looked through the book in a bookstore first, I wouldn't have purchased it."
2,Warbler?,"I thought this item was going to make some interesting sounds, but I guess not. I ordered a kit from Vellane kits that makes lots of different sounds/noises. I saw one site where you could actually listen to the sound the product makes before you buy it. I think it was a back up alarm for a vehicle."
5,Informative and inspiring reading,"In Stepping Lightly: Simplicity For People And The Planet, Mark Burch writes in an engaging and ""reader friendly"" style about the meaning, purpose, and necessity of voluntary simplicity in one's life personal lifestyle and the value of simplicity for individual and collective efforts to create a more sustainable planet and society. Burch persuasively argues for a thoughtful corse of living which requires ""cultivating mindfulness"" and personal authenticity, as well as balancing livelihood with an intentional and conscious approach to daily life. Stepping Lightly is informative and inspiring reading for anyone seeking a personal, more ecologically friendly, and satisfying lifestyle for themselves, their families, and their communities."
5,LET THE REVOLUTION BEGIN,THIS BOOK IS THE PATH TO FREEDOM! IT EXPLAINS THE DHARMA IN SIMPLE AND PRECISE TERMS. IT'S A HIGHLY ACCESSIBLE AND PRACTICAL GUIDE TO THE SPIRITUAL JOURNEY. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BUDDHISM AND WILLING TO DO THE WORK TO FREE YOURSELF FROM CONFUSION THIS IS THE BOOK TO READ.
5,Excellent meditation book,"""Wide Awake: A Buddhist Guide for Teens"" is the best book on mindfulness and meditation that I have ever read. And you don't have to be a teen to read it and benefit from it."
4,"I liked it, teens didn't.","I thought it was good, but the three teens who looked at it (honestly, they didn't read it. Losers.) just thought it was, ""okay."" The book is a good primer on Buddhism and attempts to tie Buddhist philosophy into events common to teenagers while teaching the central precepts.I cannot figure out why they didn't really like it, but then I'm always trying, and mostly failing, to figure them out. If you're an adult or a kid that is more mature than my son (Not difficult: HS Freshman) then you might really like it. I did."
5,An Inspiring Volume,"A Treasury of Women Saints shows that women are hardly the doorway to Hell and the cause of man's downfall. In fact, some of them were the means by which their husbands and children became sanctified.These women aren't too much different from you and me, except for one thing: they rose above their difficulties and made the effort to unite their consciousness with the Lord. The Treasury offers much in the way of just how each individual woman found divine union with Jesus Christ for herself. An inspiration and a divine example for women today to do the same."
2,Not Enough Saints,"For a book entitled ""Treasury of Women Saints"" the book does not have enough saints in it. With so many women saints, there really is no excuse for padding the pages with women who are not even Blesseds like Dorothy Day.Some people might find women like Day inspiring but she is not a saint. I think it is a bit presumptuous for the author to substitute her own judgment of who is a saint for that of the Church. Until the Church has declared a woman a Blessed or a Saint she should not be in a book like this. Especially, when the book includes prayers of intercession from the named ""saint."" The person might be in purgatory not heaven. We should be praying for them not the other way around.Get Butler's Lives of the Saints instead."
5,Nice!!!!,Arrived quickly. These insoles beat the heck out of the cheapo insoles you see at most stores. The fit my boots perfectly - no cutting needed - and are very comfortable. They stay in place and don't slide around.
4,good!,"Nice, thin insoles that won't bulk up the inside of your shoe. They were seemed either a bit short or narrower than the advertised size, or i would've given them 5 stars. Much better than dr. scholls / whatever else"
2,Narrow,"The insole fit a D with, and I have EEE. So they are too narrow. Seems like a good product otherwise"
4,A wonderful addition to your film review library,"I have referenced this book so many times that the cover has fallen off! It is well written in an easy to follow format. There are a lot of interesting sidebars that make the book even better. The book explores erotica in the movies. While it occasionally mentions a hardcore movie in a sidebar, it focuses on the erotic elements of mainstream movies. This ranges from the sublime to more blatent sexuality. Everything is tastefully written and the accompanying pictures are well chosen. It is a must for any film student. I highly recommend it."
4,Shipping costs too high,This is a great price for the soy protein but the shipping cost is so high that it almost makes it the same as the retail cost.
1,Just Some Mess!,"Danny Trejo has many credits under his belt. Many must love him, including myself. Still, he is in big trouble if this mess of a movie is what happens when he's a main character. Maybe like Paul Lynde, he really has to be to the sides and not at the front of the line.Let me mention just one scene that illustrates the silliness of this film. Trejo's character takes a female intern hostage as he flees a hospital. You hear all this female screaming and pleading, but the actress' mouth never moves while she is being hauled away. Trejo is walking slowly with an unwilling hostage yet the police are unable to catch up with him. Trejo has been in prison for years, yet he can shoot effectively with a hostage in one hand and the police get hit with his bullets left and right and do fake ""I'm shot!"" movements all over.A hardcore Trejo fan may want to see this, but anyone else probably won't be able to stomach it."
2,Pro-Active Idea,"I totally agree that seasons 5-9 need to be released. Instead of complaining, how about we be pro-active to a solution. We can ask CBS and Paramount how many advance copies they need sold before they release the various series? As far as cost goes, I will not fall for the trick of paying full price for 1/2 a season after the first 2 seasons were released all in one for the same price. I remember wanting a song from Celine Dion and the company would only print the disk when they had enough advance orders. You would think that these companies would want to keep happy customers in these down times. I am willing to ask - are you?The last ditch alternative is to get creative with your DVD recorder and the Hallmark Channel and build your own seasons 5-9. Hey TV is free, why not?"
2,Next season?,"I love Touched by an angel, the season 1-4 include audio and subtitle in spanish, but this DVDs not include. In my family is super important because all speak spanish. We love the program...Please, Im waiting for the seasons 5-9.ENTIRE SERIES PLEASE!! This series is wonderful, amazing, inspirational... We need full. Thanks!"
1,What Gives!!!!,"We have been waiting for a long time for seasons 5, 6, 7, 8, & 9 and this is what they release. CBS give us the remaining series or sell the rights to someone who will!"
5,Touched By an Angel,I also anxiously await the release of seasons 5-9. If you can release films that promote evil why not some that promote good.
1,I Echo the Sentiments of the One Star Raters,"There truly seems to be an ulterior motive against the release of the final 5 seasons of TBAA. It seems that this prejudice existed even with the release of Season 1. Why would Season 1 be released with the Season 9 finale if not to briefly open and close the door with one release. The Season 9 finale was an inspiration but that was due to the inspiring episodes it was based on, from Seasons 1 through 9, not Seasons 1-4. I am undecided whether I will purchase this excuse to tantalize the fans and still not satisfy the fans. Apparently there is something afoot when profits are secondary to what appears to be at best politically correctness or at worst, a spiritual darkness, which is driving this conscious effort to withhold the remaining seasons. I am not saying this in a vacuum. I wrote to CBS and Paramount with no reply, other than an empty acknowledgment that my message was received ""and appreciated."" Yeah, right!"
1,Touched by an angel releases.,"It was a big set back to see a delay or end to the future seasons to TBAA. I would not have started collecting the seasons if I have known that all the seasons would not be availabe at some time in the future. I will not be buying the quick income fixes for the studios. If they want to make money then they should offer the addition seasons which they lead the public to believe would happen. If the cost of producing the seasons was to much for them to spend then I don't know why they didn't sell the rights which several other tv shows have been done that way. I really believe it is a mistake for the public to buy these ""Collection Specials"". This is not for the publics benefit but theirs. Please don't support them. They will take advantages of the public as long as the public allows them to do so. Its the only chance to get the other seasons released."
1,"Um, where are Seasons 5-9?","Ok, I guess this release is exciting...I guess. But it would be nice to see Seasons 5-9. Release those first before this ""Inspiration Collection."" I, for one, am not happy about this release. I was looking forward to Season 6 (my favorite season) to come out."
1,"Ridiculous, CBS!!!","I won't buy this simply on principle b/c I'm so mad at CBS for not relasing the other seasons. It's very frustrating to be colecting all seasons and have it interrupted like this. Why buy these when you already have some of the episodes ont hem. Does CBS think we're this stupid? RELEASE 5 - 9, CBS! This was the best show on TV of all time! I will not buy any of these ""special"" ones but will continue to buy the regular seasons should you wisely choose to release them. If you don't want to do it, sell the rights to someone smart enough to know what to do with them!"
1,Don't jump for joy just yet.,"With nearly half of the ENTIRE SERIES already available on DVD, you'd think the next logical step would be to release Season 5, right? CBS and Paramount has apparently dropped this idea, and will only be releasing ""collections"" of the episodes that are considered the ""best"". There are only 4 episodes on this set, 3 of which has been released on DVD already.I know I should be happy but I'm not. I assume this is for financial reasons (not like CBS and Paramount combined are hurting) and this is better than nothing but it is a lame attempt to appease the fans when nearly half of the series on DVD has been released already. Nearly every tv show known to man is being released on DVD, and they pull a stunt like this? I would say this release should not be supported, but I fear if it's not they will never release seasons of TBAA on DVD again. This is truly a disappointment, and that's an understatement."
3,Did you know that...,"I discovered ""Touched by an Angel"" airs on the Hallmark channel frequently. Where I live its channel 78 on cable. Usually on at 8pm weeknights. Recently saw on TV that program will start showing again starting Jan.4, 2010."
5,Great companion book,"In my opinion this books makes an excellent companion book to Ron Champion's book. I would have liked it to go into a bit more detail in a couple of areas, in particular front funders. It answered a number of questions I didn't even know I had. You can build one of Campion's cars without this book, but I think you'll be be glad if you buy a copy. if you buy a copy but don't have Champion's book, I'd advise you to get a copy."
5,Watch this!,"Saw this watch in a foreign city at more than twice the price of purchasing on Amazon. The watch has a very readable face and a no-nonsense setting operation. Very please with the look, style and color. If only the date window were a bit larger---or maybe it's my eyes??"
4,Great purchase,"A great quality book and all pages are free of writing and highlighting. Arrived quickly, too!"
4,Solid Album,"This new release from UB40 is really quite good. The band moves away from some of the synthetic sounds found on their recent albums, and returns to form with simple, clear grooves. Their unsophisticated, left-wing politics aren't my cup of tea, but only three songs are marred by such diatribes. And it is nice to see a new album from the band that is not an import costing $30 or $40."
3,Disapointing,"I was looking for this book for a long time, so when I found a nice affordable copy I was very excited. But the book was quite disapointing - maybe part of my problem is that I have been looking for it for so long, but still it does not compare well to Tarr's other ""Crusade"" books, Alamut particularly, which is much better. Some of the problems I had with A Wind in Cairo is choppy writing, where one is not quite certain what refers to what, a lack of resolution about an event which causes Khamsin's transformation, and somehow the reverse transformation into a man seems oddly unconvincing. And despite trying not to judge the book by some minor plot events but I found the notion of Khamsin having a daughter disturbing, what cames of her, is she totally horse, does he worry about her when he returns to human shape? Very weird.It's an interesting book, but Judith Tarr wrote better ones."
5,WOODY GUTHRIE SONGS TO GROW ON FOR MOTHER AND CHILD,"I LOVE THIS CD, MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS CD AND MY 19 MONTH OLD GRANDSON LOVES THIS CD"
5,LOVE these songs!,"My 4-year-old loves this album! The songs get stuck in your head, though ;) The only down-side is the sound quality"
2,Not something a jedi would sleep on,My son has a Star Wars themed room and the finishing touch is the bedding. It works well with the theme - however the sheets are stiff and uncomfortable. Also when you was them make sure nothing else gets into the wash with them - the fabric bleeds (ask our socks!) I would not recommend this particular bed set because of its lack in quality.
5,This cd comes in second to Mestre Bimba's cd,This cd is a great cd. Mestre Suassuna adds his own flavor to the songs while keeping them the traditional way.
2,One man's truth is another mans fiction,"Looking over some of the reviews I think the authors had their friends write in for them and put in a good word. It's a fair book, not a great book, and while I won't go so far as to get into the authors credentials you do have to wonder with books like these. While the book did introduce me to variants of the system I had never heard of, I don't know how much of the history is fact, fiction, or faction."
5,Best history and sub-style comparison I've seen by far.,"Excellent overall coverage of various histories and most sub-styles of the martial art of Wing Chun, written as objectively as possible. Many people will learn much from this book."
2,Boring to read.,"I was so excited to received my copy of Complete Wing Chun. After reading through a couple of chapters, I was dissapointed. Most of the materials are already in the internet. I expected more materials, more pictures, etc. Example What is unique in Yuen Kay San's Wing Chun? In Pan Nam's, etc. A comparison between the various types of Wing Chun will be very helpfull. Differences in stances, footworks, techniques, and drills. I expected more in the format of GM William Cheung's book ""Comparison of JKD and Wing Chun""."
4,History - not training or how to...,"I give this book a 4, only because I think that most people who will be looking for Wing Chun books will be looking for something more along the 'how to' line.However, this book is written quite well, and from a very objective point of view (IMO).As with any martial arts, Wing Chun has been around for awhile (not as long as most)and has obviously branched off in different directions. This doesn't make any of those branches incorrect, just different.I think this book explains this nicely, and shows that there is a common thread to them all.So if you're looking for more info on Wing Chun background, this book is 5 STARS!!!"
1,a waste of space on your shelf,"If you have lots of spare change and a lot of space to waste on your shelf then you might buy this book. There is little ""complete"" about the book, the title is very misleading."
2,Inadequate research & biased favor for Yip Man & Yuen KaySan,"Without adequate research and candid comparisons, the authors are too hasty to claim that all Wing Chun schools are the same (p116 -- the three main boxing forms are fairly consistent in organization throughout the various styles; p117 -- All have, and none have.) Their statement appears to be made out of respect for the various schools. However, by ignorng the obvious differences in curricula and by generalizing the similarities of the three main forms, they are now ready to extol their practiced styles toward the end of their text -- the Yip Man and Yuen Kay-Shan styles (p118-120.) These two styles have been subtly positioned to be the standard of reference for comparative studies. Hence the differences found in other Wing Chun styles are ascribed to influences from non Wing Chun kung fu."
3,A Very Interesting Book,"I liked the book a lot and finished the book in one day. I liked the stories and it was a Short concise read. There were also insights into a few of the systems such as pictures of certain postures and applications of the varied lineages.Although I liked the book I would not call it ""Complete Wing Chun"". The chapters were short and not comprehensive enough. Even though they chose a few of the major lineages, they did not go into as much detail as I would have liked. Maybe a little more detail on more of the principles and applications that set the lineages apart. I just wished that they had gone into more detail. Hopefully there will be more books on the individual lineages."
4,What can I say - It works :),"This was a replacement for a handset that mysteriously died. I think that the water inside was probably the reason :) Anyway, it the base unit found it right away and it seems to be working fine. I just need to figure out how to waterproof this one..........."
4,Solid,"Solid phone - inexpensive, works well. If you have the vtech system, this is a great choice for adding a phone where it's convenient - not where you have a phone jack."
5,Works great with Vonage,I have very pleased with this purchase. Great price any very easy to setup. I have had no sound quality issues.
4,1 failed - bought two more...,"I had a 3 phone system and one of the units failed after a year and a half use. I replaced it with two more handsets. I have two complaints with these units - you can not upload or transmit your directory list and this list is limited to 50 numbers. Other than that, and the failure (it would no longer recognize the base station i.d.), these work for me."
4,Free version from Public Domain is the best version to get 'for the money'.,"The $2.99 version from Amazon is essentially the same as the free ($0.00) version from publisher 'Public Domain Books' and both have much better formatting than the Einstein Books version which is $0.99. I'm not sure, but it seems that I got both the $2.99 version and the $0.00 version at the same time from Amazon - even though I paid for the $2.99 version. So try to get the free one first since it's formatting is just as good.(Update after posting review) In fact this review shows up on both of the versions from Amazon - so I got both together."
1,"seminal, well-written scientific work - but unreadable on Kindle","This is a seminal work by an important scientist. But the line breaks are wrong in the Kindle edition. Read it only if you have patience for poorly justified text. I've found that many of the free or very inexpensive Kindle editions are poorly laid out. If someone would take a little time and do it right I would gladly pay a few bucks more. E-editions are a great way to make important works like this one more widely known, but I for one find them unreadable when lines of text jump around and are staggered."
5,get out the Kleenex....,"and i don't mean for crying. Brother I've seen my fair share of soft porn, and they usually turn out to be busts. but this here video is as good, if not better, than it's box cover.wall to wall sex scenes and a lead actress that is anything but a skank ho, lead to one highy enjoyable, if lonely, evening."
2,"a little too ""domed"" for my taste",Unfortunately I don't like this bag. It reminds me of a bag for a bowling ball - nice large size but a little too rounded/domed at the top. Good quality and the shipping was perfect but personally not what I expected.
4,Interesting - Very sweet,"This is a very charming book with lots of historical facts as well as beautiful pictures and drawings. The history of the talking bouquet is quite interesting, being influenced from several different countries. Lots of specific bouquets are pictured and labeled, including bouquet examples for ""Admiring a Creative Talent"", ""Embarking on a New Adventure"", ""First Day in a New School/Job/City"", and ""Support During a Difficult Divorce"" to name a few. There are several dozen more. The step-by-step guide to making these bouquets were easy to follow. A wonderful gift book."
3,Good for Display; too Flimsy for Play,"This little Frozone figure looks cool (pun intended) standing safely in a curio cabinet, but his skinny little ankles and neck make him much weaker than any superhero ought to be. Use extreme caution when removing him from his package so as not to break his tiny head off."
4,This was a good movie,The only Gigi movies I saw was on the internet and they did not speak English. I'm glad they made this movie and I enjoyed it very much. The part I liked the most was when Gigi sang that nice song of reaching for your dreams in the end.
3,Quite Interesting but A Very Difficult Read,"This book was on the syllabus for my class titled: The Politics of Violence in 20th Century Europe. Arendt is a well known and respected author but this book is quite dense and very hard to comprehend at times. The introduction, for example, went completely over my head and I am fairly well versed in both European history and politics. Still, she put forth some fascinating arguments, and she is clearly an expert on the topic. One aspect that she addressed in particular was the difference between a Totalitarian government and a Dictatorship. I don't want to give her arguments away, so go and get the book yourself!!"
4,"kingdom,series3","Series 3, the 2009-2010 season of Kingdom does not disappoint, but has all the charm of the first shows. We see the characters develop slowly, and of course the season ends with a great cliff-hanger, as only Kingdom can do (and no, Simon does not come back, again)."
5,Kingdom,"Kingdom is a pleasant, funny, enjoyable series and it is unfortunate it was only televised for three seasons."
3,Too Short,"I was happy to see Stephen Fry in a series, I love his acting abilities, my only complaint is that in season three there are only a mere two episodes a dvd. What happened to a series having six or more shows? I also own Doc Martin, these are great shows, and I do agree with one gentleman about Stephen not being in his usual witty role. He simply is just a nice guy in Kingdom. Still worth watching."
4,Crazy Moon,Although I am not a Kiefer Sutherland fan (because he always plays Jerks on film) his performance is totally out of character and probably my only film I like him in.
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, the transfer of this dvd from the original film was not done well. It was extremely grainy and seemed to be a copy of a copy. It was difficult to enjoy the film for its unique merits when the quality of the picture itself was so compromised."
3,American Terriost,This book was ordered for my grandson. He is very interested in things of interest that has happened to our country and has become a part of our history.
4,chilling,"The most chilling point of the book is that Tim McVeigh was the typical kid next door. He was the boy who played with your sons, who slept in your house and ate at your dinner table. The most striking thing about him was how ordinary he was. Somehow the Tim McVeigh's of this world have not learned the fundimental lessons of living in a Democracy, that the government has guaranteed his right to free speech and thought. I wonder if he ever voted in an election. I am not for the death penalty but I make the exception in his case."
5,WHY?,"Because this book is banned in some areas caused me absolute intent to purchase, read and keep it.Libertarians, long disenchanted with the oppressive federal government, perhaps share some of the feelings of the terrorist killer.However, our federal government is not our enemy unlike England was to our founding fathers here. What we have in government is our own doings and we have legal ways of causing change.This killer thought the ends justified the means; to demonstrate how displeased he was at our government.All good Americans should take the time to read this book."
5,book review,is a good book regarding tim mcveigh though of course a bit media biased as are all books dealing with this subject in particular...is a personal thought and not anything to do with a particular group or city in usa...
4,Very readable account,Gives some incite into the mind of Timothy Mc Veigh. The only thing I didnt like was it helped Mr MC Veigh get his views out and thus helped him to accomplish at least one of his goals. If you are interested in the Oklahoma bombing case this is a good start.
4,Fun for kids,"These are great dry erase markers for kids.We all know how much kids can abuse markers, so I wanted to get a cheap set that wouldn't be ruined right away, and would be easier for my little ones to use. These are perfect for smaller hands, and in bright colors that kids like. The tip is bigger than it appears in the picture, and has withstood my kids abuse thus far. The erasers on the end are a nice touch and work pretty well, however they are obviously not meant for erasing the entire board.I would not recommend these for office use/large board use however. They are too small for that, and would run out quickly. I could see these being good for use with a projector or a dry erase calender, but these are not the big, longer lasting chisel tip markers. These would be good for occasional use on a smaller board.I don't see these lasting forever, but for the price they can't be beat."
4,Great for my daughter's easel,"My daughter got aMelissa & Doug Deluxe Standing Easelfor Christmas. I was looking for something to work with the dry erase board side that wasn't too smelly. I bought these andCrayola 8ct Dry Erase Crayons Large Size. Both work well, but the crayons have a tendency to be wasted on the paper because they look too much like regular crayons. These markers have the eraser attached to the lid and she can tell a definite difference between them and ""regular"" markers so there is no wasted expensive ink on paper. When they dry up, I will definitely buy more."
1,dried up!,Wow...not happy with these at all! Especially given the fact that some of the colors were already dried up! Not worth the hassle in returning them...but I just expected better.
2,Erasers are the most disapointing,We have a white board that the kids play with and I thought these markers might be good because they each have their own eraser... no more fighting over the eraser. But these markers seems harder to erase than other we've used and the erasers don't cut it. Two fell off the first day we used them and one is flaking into bits.
3,Not as opaque as expected,"I have many other types of dry erase markers I have used. This brand of markers might be okon a white dry erase board, but it didn't come across very well on a blue one we have.We have several dry-erase boards. We have one we use almost every day that has a 3-D blue design for its background. These markers aren't dark enough, bright enough, opaque enough or however you want to say it- to make it easy to read.The lines it leaves aren't exactly crisp either- meaning the edges can look a bit blurry for folks whose eyes don't focus as well anymore- like mine. I tried all the colors. I don't know why companies even make yellow markers since I can't see them well on any surface.So while these will work, they really could have been made easier to read."
4,Quartet ReWritables vs. Expo Washables,"We use a lot of dry erase markers in our family's homeschool. The last set I triedExpo Washable Bullet Tip Dry Erase Markers, 6 Colored Markers) was a complete disaster as they stained my whiteboard and it took rubbing alcohol to clean it. Fortunately I didn't have that problem with these Quartet ReWritables! The orange one did leave a bit of residue when I erased it with the eraser on the tip of the marker. However, it came off easily when I used the spray cleaner.The one thing that surprised me was that the colors of the inks looked darker on the whiteboard than I had been expecting from the colors on the markers. That's not really a bad thing, however, as the darker colors make the writing easier to see.I will definitely be choosing these in the future over the terrible Expo Washables."
2,Should have read the reviews...,"I purchased these to go with my dry erase calendar. I thought they were great because they're magnetic and they have erasers on top. Unfortunately, the quality reflects the price here because when I write with them, I can barely see the ink. It is really faint and watered down. I would NOT recommend these OR buy them again."
3,JUST OK,"Magnets are not stronger enough, they barley hold the pen. Pens work fine, the eraser is not of much use. You get what you pay for! For disposable pens they are fine."
2,Run out very fast,I liked the selection of colors and the fact that they are magnetic. But after a while the ink or liquid of the marker runs out and it doesn't work like it used to anymore. The only marker that is still working is the green one.
2,colors are hard to read,"i was disappointed with these pens. the pigment in the marker seems pretty weak so it isn't easy to read on the white board. why would they include yellow on a white board? i can't see that at all. i like the magnet on the cap in theory, but practically the markers are small so you have to squish the eraser to make the cap snap back onto the marker. i am a mom with three school-age children and a full schedule to manage so i was looking for markers to help me organize all the events in a color-coordinated way. these markers did not help me accomplish this."
3,"Great size, but","Great size - exactly what I wanted. Blue and purple look almost identical, and yellow is very light. Red and green are difficult to erase."
2,color,"The purple marker was the same exact color as the blue one. I wasn't too happy with that, but otherwise the markers were great"
2,These markers really suck,"Erasers pop out often, the markers themselves have a habit of popping open at random (very temperamental caps) and drying out when you're not looking. These markers are way too fragile, and by the second week of owning them I found that half of the erasers were missing and the other ones I had in a little baggy by the markers themselves.Will never buy dry erase markers from this company again."
4,Could Be Better,"I also bought the bright colors pack and was perfectly happy with them. This set, compared with the brights, just does not stand up as well. It started with all the pens being covered in dirt or something, that did not come off with a casual dust. The pens work well, but I prefer the other set better."
3,They dry up and the magnets are too weak,"They dry up with infrequent use and the magnets are too weak. If you mark something and left it to dry on a surface for a while, it doesn't erase easily unless you get some water on it. Other then that, they are a good idea, and pretty fun to use. Good for leaving notes, or doing fun doodles on the fridge or glass surfaces."
2,"One broke first day, and they didn't last long after that","The purple one lost it's magnet the very first day. With normal use, they ran out quickly. I'd stick with the standard before buying these again."
3,Great for home use,These pens are quite small and great for filling in the family calender but not good for the boardroom as the lines are too thin.The eraser fell off the pen as soon as I opened the lid so they arent well made and I probably would send them back if I hadnt got them on a cyber monday deal.
2,Seemed like a good idea at the time,"I bought a white board that came with one of these markers and I thought it was ingenious but when I purchased this pack from Amazon, the markers were very poor quality. Though I have no complaints about the handy eraser or magnet function, writing with the markers was a useless venture. The brand-new markers wrote like very well-worn dry-erase markers even when pressing down firmly."
3,magnetic erasable marker,"I'd buy these again because they're convenient. The magnets, however, have fallen off each marker eventually."
1,Markers are very dull,"All the pens in this pack are very dull. I have a previous pen, and the black is vibrant and black. These colors are dull and seem watered down."
1,Cute but not the best,"I prefer Quartet dry-erase markers. When I needed something smaller and functional for my cubicle, I thought these would be perfect. I was pleased by the size, the magnet on the cap as well as a matching mini eraser. However, their functionality leaves a lot to be desired. The magnets are rather weak. They either fall of their own accord or a light brush of the hand knocks them off, and the rest often follow suit. The eraser is flimsy and pops out easily.Only redeeming value: Markers work."
3,Bought Once to Try,"Since we use dry erase markers frequently at our learning center, I bought a pack of these to try something different. My very young students were intrigued by the magnetic feature of these markers and by the eraser. Some became so intrigued that the markers became distractions as they played with the magnet and pulled out the eraser.The markers themselves didn't last long and don't have that bold, dark look I like in markers, not even when first opened. My short lived experiment wasn't exactly a disaster, but was far from a success either. The built in eraser is a great concept and works well as long as it stays where it belongs."
3,Not very strong,"While I like that these markers have handy magnets & wipe-off sponges on their caps, the ink isn't very bold, and hard to see on a dry erase board. Decent for the money, but not something I would necessarily buy again."
2,The colors are WAY TOO light,"I use dry erase markers all the time and I like the skinny, multi-color packs. But this brand or this pack was way to light it was hard to see. I wouldn't recommend them."
3,3.5* - Erasers are flimsy,"As an educator and parent, I use dry-erase markers a lot and have tried many brands. I like the cap mounted dry-erase mini-markers because they are practical, and having the erasers on the cap makes them handy and convenient.As for these Quartet-brand markers:Pros- nice range of colors, there's pink, purple, orange, yellow, light green and blue- low odor as advertized, and came out on top when I compared the odor with some of my other brand markers- the marker tip does not get easily bent and the lines are clear and well-defined when used for writingCons- the erasers at the end are cheap and flimsy, and easily fall out unlike another brand I use which has better quality erasers"
3,"Nice markers, erasers fall off","I really like the colors on these markers, they are easy to write with, and the writing is quite readable. The magnets are neat, too: we can just stick them on the whiteboard and leave them there. I really was in favor of the cap-mounted erasers, though, and half of them fell off the first day. For the price, get the markers if you like the colors, but don't count on the little bitty erasers."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I bought these not expecting much. I did expect all to write. Out of 6 half did. I use the black, red and blue mainly -those have ink. It's still annoying. Don't waste your money."
4,"Fun colors, handy magnets and erasers","This marker set has fun, bright colors (although the yellow one is of limited use on a white board). They have magnets in the cap, which makes them handy for white boards without a pen tray. They have little erasers on the cap, which is convenient for making a small correction. For erasing the whole board, you're still going to want a separate, full-size eraser.These don't seem quite as high quality as the office standards like Expo, but the little handy touches make them nice for home calendars, kids rooms, dorm rooms, etc."
3,"Fine for the price, but not for high-quality technical drawing","If you're looking for some markers to put some fun colors on the whiteboard, these will work fine. Your kids will have a great time drawing with them.But, if you're doing lots of technical work on a whiteboard, the smudges, imprecise lines, and general size/feel of these compared to full-sized (and higher cost) color whiteboard markers will be obvious."
5,Love them!,"These markers are awesome; they very easily solve the problem of not having an eraser for your white board handy. In the past, I've always had to use the side of my hand, which would lead to various marker-clothing disasters. The colors are vibrant and easily visible from a distance. I've been using the purple one heavily and it has yet to dry out. I like how it is smaller than your average marker - it feels more like a pen and can be transported (read: tucked behind an ear) easily. I also like the magnetic feature of the cap, where the marker sticks to the board. A good deal and good product!"
3,Choose Your Application Well,"These dry erase markers are adequate for small at home projects but if you are looking at longer term use as in a classroom, look elsewhere. The magnet feature makes it theoretically attractive for teachers, but it is not particularly strong and the ink insufficient to make these practical. Likewise with the eraser....it simply is not convenient or useful. Good for kitchens or dorm doors."
4,Dry Erase markers,These markers are great - they last a long time and come with the eraser on the top of the pen - they also go well with the boards I ordered Laura
1,Very light,I purchased two sets. One for my dry erase boards at home and one. For a big calendar at work. These markers are VERY light on my home white plastic and grey plastic boards. They are fine on the work hard heavy board. So your luck may vary.
2,Needed erasers!!!,"Have great markers for my dry erase Calendar white board. But, only had the Big eraser. Needed handy small erasers to erase small writing on day-to-day written details... So! for $3.66(Free Shipping!!??) I got what I wanted AND the fact that they have magnets was a bonus for me.If you are looking for vibrant color for everyday writing?...PASS!!!, 'cause like other reviewers have written, they are extremely dull and my green one is about dried out!!! and the top appeared to have been on there securely!!!"
4,Super Handy At Work,"I use these at work on a laminated worksheet (to save ink/paper). It's handy having the eraser right on the end. The magnet seems kind of wasted as the weight, or maybe the odd shape, makes the markers fall off the fridge. Otherwise, these are great."
3,"Great for the Kids, not for Work","Bottom line:Cheap construction, too small, weak magnets, and floppy erasers make for a less than ideal experience.The magnets aren't strong enough to hold these to my work white board, they slide down slowly. The caps are cheap and flimsy and sometimes difficult to put on the back, and the eraser weight at the end makes them awkward. The eraser is a handy feature, but flops around a lot when you are using it, they made them a bit too long. The fine tip can be useful for detail work. Color choice is also not ideal and there is no black marker, but I guess that is why they call them screamers, but I think the orange is a bit muddy looking, and the yellow hard to see. They don't really scream to me. I think I will stick to the basic Expo pack, thank you very much, but these might appeal to people looking for odd colors for decorative drawing or maybe calendars, etc where they want to color code things."
2,"Touching, but feels a little too much like ""Accidental Tourist""","As a life-long John Williams fan, I can't help but pick up the similarities between this score and John Williams' score to ""The Accidental Tourist"", both thematically and instrumentally. Start listening to the theme especially and you can't miss it. Don't get me wrong, Horner did a nice job with this and it's a beautiful score, but the Accidental tourist similarities are a little too strong."
5,Introduce your child to music and culture!,"Ella Jenkins does it again! This is an educational and fun CD--the first part introduces various rhythm makers from around the world from bongo drums to cow bells. Ella Jenkins narrates. Then she uses wonderful songs from different cultures to demonstrate rhythm. Your child may tire of the first portion of the CD, but the second part is all fun sing-alongs, certain to introduce new vocabulary and new melodies that will be memorable to your child--and the music is enjoyable for adults too! CD is probably most appropriate for ages 2-6, however, my daughter seemed to begin enjoying it at 8 months!"
4,wrong video in the box,"I had the Tae Bo Live Advanced monthly series 10 years or so ago when they first came out. I think these were Billy's best work honestly. All of his new stuff is far too easy. Anyway, #3 was my very favorite and I used it until it died. I was thrilled when I saw it here on Amazon so I ordered it right away! I couldn't believe my luck!!! Well, what was in the box was not #3. The box said #3 and the video itself had a sticker on it that said #3 but it was absolutely not #3. It was one of the monthly volumes but just not the one it was supposed to be. I'm pretty disappointed as this one was more expensive than the others. Like I said though, this series is still WAY better and harder than Billy's new stuff so I might keep it. Just a word of caution to those out there who are looking for this series."
5,"Tae Bo Advanced Live, Vol. 3","I've tried lots of Tae Bo tapes. My favorites are the advanced Get Ripped series which I use about 4 days a week. The Advanced Live, Vol.3, is very good, maybe a little less intense. I like the music on it too. And as always, Billy Blanks is very inspirational."
3,American Hollow,I am not from Kentucky but I personally know relatives of this family and I have visited this mountain area with them. This is really how this family lives and I find the documentory and the book to be actual fact regarding this situation. Many of the relatives have left the area over the years and do lead fine lives in other states. This would represent the remainder of the family that chose to stay with their roots.
2,A Dangerous generalization,"I am not familiar with the particular family that is the focus of the book and documentary, but having lived in Eastern Kentucky all my life, I can attest to the fact that this family represents the exception and not the rule. It is quite dangerous to generalize that the entire region is full of families living in such conditions. There are poverty-stricken people in every region, even in inner-cities. Documentaries like this serve to perpetuate the ""hillbilly"" stereotype that is so demeaning and destructive to the proud people of Appalachia. Most of us are not living without modern conveniences, technological advances, or even advanced education. I would have appreciated the spirit of this effort if there had been any attempt to distinguish the experiences of this family from the majority of the population of Eastern Kentucky. Instead, they are presented as a typical example of the ""modern"" Appalachian family. That is a shamefully deceptive myth."
2,Sister's thank you,"""~I thought I would share with the readers the note sent by my sister when she finished the book purchased for her. She is in daily contact with people of the area, she wrote to me, ""Thanks again for the book. I really enjoyed it. Some of the language I could""~ job. So far to go to find employment and if factories come in they don't"
2,"Nice pictures, hard to read","This is the story of a conversation between two old teddy bears. As such, there is no particular plot - indeed, the conversation doesn't really go anywhere either. Each bear makes statements which he doesn't seem to understand, then tries to explain what he means to the other bear. (For example, at the start of the book one bear announces that he is an Idle Bear, but doesn't know why. Several pages later he states that his owner was an Idle, and that's why he's an Idle Bear.)I found it very hard to read, as it didn't follow any plot or train of thought, and assume it would also be difficult to listen to. The Idle Bear has been translated into several languages, and so it must have an appeal for certain readers. The pictures of the two pondering bears are very lovely."
1,This is the Worst Ever Handheld Calculator,"I thought this was great because it had the cover, but after using it for a few minutes it was clear this is junk. The keys stick because the openings are not engineered properly. It truly is the worst handheld I have ever bought."
3,Misleading photo,"Although the product is good, I have been caught out with the misleading photo accompanying the description of the product. I feel this is dishonest. Yes, the description does not actually state ""cloths"", but having a photo showing 4 small cloths is misleading. I doubt I would have paid almost $10 (shipping included) for a cloth the size of which you could do no more with than clean your reading glasses. I give it a 3 star rating only because I believe the seller is dishonest when using a photo showing 4 cloths, then sends only 1."
1,Disappointed,"I love the larger MysticMaid cloths for windows, but the personal size one I used on my eyeglasses and did not like the results. It also seems to have a courser texture and I was a bit afraid it might scratch the lenses, but it did not. I really would pass on this product if I had the chance."
3,Retired gardner,The design works well but the Quality of the product is BAD the reflective paint orcoating falls off easy I have e-mailed the company they don't care to talk to you!
5,Excellent treatment of this subject,"The definitive book on this famous helicopter. Over ten years of research went into it. Covered in detail are the design, use, and world-wide operational history. Included are hundreds of back+white and color pictures. Required reading for Sikorsky helicopter fans."
3,A Brother and Sister Act - - - Why not more with these two?,"I disagree with Leonard Maltin's opinion that this is a ""dreadful film"". It's a good film with a good cast; Julia Roberts makes her first film appearance and, to my knowledge, her only appearance with her brother, Eric, a fine actor who is seldom given the credit he deserves. My emotions were stirred by the unjust inflictions suffered by the wine growers. The film was impressive enough to inspire me to check railroad history and learn what I can to determine whether there really were any unscrupulous railroad barons like Dennis Hopper's character; incidentally, he handled the Irish accent very well."
3,You'll fight for the characters!,This is a story of a man who has imigrated from a foreign country only to find his land is being sought after by a dirty businessman who wants to put a railroad through it for his own benefit. Eric Roberts plays the son who fights for his right to deny access to his family's land. It's a predictable movie that leaves you wanting someone to re-write the ending.
4,"FANS OF DENNIS HOPPER, ERIC & JULIA ROBERTS","Your collection is not complete without Blood Red. If you are a fan of Hopper or Roberts, you should see it. It is no one's best movie, but it was Julia's first--even though Mystic Pizza came out before it. Eric Roberts introduce's his sister, portraying his sister! And who can resist all the other great names in supporting roles? Happy viewing!-Pat"
4,Interesting and exctiing,"I am enjoying reading this book as much as the other Lisa See books I have read on my Kindle and purchased through Amazon. The main character, Hulan is a strong female and I happen to like books about women with a definite personality. She reminds me of the CSI agents on television and is methodical about her process in finding out who the dead man is. I am in the process of finding out who and why this man was killed. I felt that the beginning was a little to long and could have been a little shorter but other than that I have no other negative comments. Lisa See certainly gives the reader full knowldege of the areas she is writing about. I look forward to more."
5,Loved it as I do all her books.,She is such a good writer and really enjoyed this one too!! A great mystery set in China. I learn more about Chinese history and culture with each read and the stories are great too!
3,Dragon Bones,"I heard Lisa See speak at the Los Angeles Prologue Society in May 2003, at which I also received a copy of her book. It starts slowly but then gets your attention very dramatically. Ms. See tells a good story. I look forward to getting her other books about Inspector Hulan."
2,Dragonbones by Lisa See,"While I loved the ""Snowflower and the Secret Fan"" story, I felt this story was lifted right off the Indiana Jones adventures--trite and boring....been there, read that...nothing new...contrived. Found myself skimming thru many, many pages. Used plot, etc. I predicted the outcome from the first.....this is NOT a 5-star thriller!!!"
1,Too Non-fictiony,Usually like these types of books but this one was too dry. Could have done with a lot more 'novel' feel to it.
1,New category for pop music,"I just listened to Arthur's Theme, from ""Hopelessly Romantic"" and all I could think of is a new category for easy listening music. Up till now we have ""bland orchestrated pop music,"" now we have ""bland choral pop music."" There was absolutely NO emotion in this song. Don't take me wrong, I am a HUGE fan of easy listening music and have hundreds of albums that some would consider elevator music. This arrangement is just plain boring."
1,Money Money Money Money Money Money Money,"Its all about the money. This book sounds like it was written for a bunch of 5 year olds. It was written by Jonathon and ""Shamael"". I bought this book thinking that it would have some good info. It did have about 5 pages or so of actual information. I marked the rest of the book with a b.s. symbol. If anyone wants a book that already has the actual information marked off from the bs email me.If you want a book on this subject that still deals with religion somewhat I would recommend the Cosmic Octave by Cousto. His book is filled with info and graphs and charts. I was disappointed to see a few money making skemes with him, but I guess it is to be expected with this sort of thing."
1,"Nice concept, if it works","My DRT400 worked beautifully for one day. Then, on day two, its front panel said ""WELCOME"" and that is where it stayed. Humax tech support was unable to help, so they are sending me a new unit (while putting a $400 hold on my credit card.) It will arrive in 5 to 7 business days.That is NOT my idea of good customer service.It is also INSANE to require the use of a land line telephone connection (which I do not have) when the unit contains networking components. It SHOULD offer to connect to WiFi right out of the box!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"I have never written a review like this before but we have had so many problems with this product that i feel i should warn people. We have been through 3 boxes and still do not have one that works. The first worked for about 2 months before the dvd writer died. The other 2 boxes didn't work at all. Unfortunately the warranty doesn't last long (i think it was 2 months or something). So we had to pay for a replacement. So if you buy this product, i hope you have time to spend hours on the the phone trying to get a replacement and i hope you don't mind having weeks where you have no box to use (while you are still paying for the tivo service). And by the way, the support from Humax has been awful!"
4,Real Cool book,"Excellent illustrations, cute story that captivates the kids attention. I especially like the names of the supporting charactors - Festus, Pustule, & ""Studs the Goblin"". A fun story to read to your kids."
5,"If you love Invader Zim, you NEED to buy this!!","You know what's awesome? Not paying top dollar for the retarded ""omg cardboard house"" in the Collector's Set.This Complete Invasion box set includes the entirety of seasons 1, 2, and 3, and therefore has all the Zim you could possibly get your greasy little hands on.So, for the love of all things GIR, you owe it to yourself to buy this set."
5,Awesome!,Invader Zim rules! I absolutely love the show! It's a shame that the series was cut off so shortly.
3,Invader Zim Set (New?),Bought an Invader Zim complete set for my daughter. Set looked new but DVD's froze or skipped a little. Looked at the disks and noticed some marks. So was it new to begin with?
4,I'm gonna sing the doom song!,"Invader Zim perhaps appeals to an obscure taste. Certainly as I watched this my flatmates were divided in to love, hate and confused indifference. But if you're a fan of the absurd and surreal you can't hope to find a better show.The humour of Zim can best be compared to the silliness of Monty Python, the Goons or the Goodies but its stories are filled with a nihilistic contempt for modern life. As such quoting lines probably won't convince you that this show had me nearly crying with laughter.Having all three seasons works against this set as it includes the half dozen or so episodes that don't quite hit the mark but over all the genius of the other episodes shines through."
5,Super. My kiddo is watching it right now,"Read other reviews for details. I bought this as a gift for my son's birthday, and he loves it. It came more quickly than I expected (Prime - two day shipping, came a day early). I recommend it to anyone who likes this show."
5,OMG SQUEE!!!!,"This is, without a single slice of crusty doubt, one of the coolest TV shows to ever walk the land. It's chock full of stupidity, tacos, poop, aliens, and Dib's giant head!!! Seriously, what is up with his head?!?!I recommend this to anyone who has children, wants children, was a children, or will be a children. This show will make you faster, stronger, better. Women will want to do really weird (in a good way) things to you after you show them Gir in all his ""enhanced"" glory.BUY THIS!"
5,Zim: God of Funny and DOOM,"This is a Great Collection of all the 3 seasons of Zim. I am sure the most of the people who Know Zim and the series will really appreciate this collection. There has been another collection but I a not sure it is a comprehensive as this one. I liked the comentary, believe it or not, from the Cast and Creators. I would reccomend this set to Anyone who has the 'Love of Zim'."
5,best boxset,"way better than any other invader zim boxet,,,, awsome ,, 10/10 on the show ,, in the words og gir"" i love this show"""
5,Funny,This is crazy yet so funny. Zim's little robot companion is so funny you can't wait to see what he is doing. Its like watching a little kid asking goofy questions. Well you can't go wrong with the box set cost and you get plenty of entertainment.
4,Zim Rocks!,"This is one of the greatest shows that Nickledeon ever aired.The trials of an alien that refuses to learn about Earth culture trying to adapt to Earth. With Vasquez's unique art stylings, this is an action packed show."
5,I miss my cupcake.....,I love this show. This was the best buy I have ever made. I love this show. I wish it didn't end! I will admit I am obsessed with GIR. And I am 22. My husband is 27 and he loves this show!! It's a lot of fun to quote and watch. I have to admit I was impressed too. WATCH IT YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED AT ALL!!
1,Still waiting to get order,Placed order in November of 2008. Still waiting for Amazon to fulfill the order I placed seven months ago.
5,Best Money I Ever Spent!,"To begin with this is the best show ever (if you have the right sense of humour). I have watched these DVDs too many times to count since I bought the set and I am still not sick of them. The cast commentary is so fun, you get to learn about a lot of neat ideas and background info that were never revealed because of the short running time of the series on Nickelodeon. If you love Zim this is money well spent!"
5,Invader Zim Complet Invation,This DVD series is hysterial and very entertaining. My entire family is enjoys watching them.
1,"Where are they, Amazon?","I ordered these for a friend of mine in November for a Christmas present. As a poor starving college student, I selected standard shipping rather than the ""Guaranteed by Christmas"" shipping, even though the shipping date was December 26th. The DVDs have still not shipped, and the arrival date keeps getting pushed back. Any contact I have made with Amazon to voice my frustration has been met with a ""You can cancel your order."" I do not want to cancel my order, I just want to know if there is any possible way Amazon will ship these to me before next Christmas. My friend has been an incredible sport with the whole ordeal, but I don't think I will trust Amazon in the future. I think the $120 price at Best Buy is preferable to the hassle and indifferent treatment I have received here."
4,Great for the Nautically Obsessed,"To fans of Cornwell's great historical fiction, the novels in the thriller series may disappoint. These are modern mysteries (inverted detective stories) with sailing themes and accurate accounts of seamanship and nautical lore. The thriller series includes ""Wildtrack"" (1988), ""Sea Lord"" (1989), ""Crackdown"" (1990), and ""Storm Child"" (1991) -- so these were published during the release of several novels in the Sharpe series. For the nautically obsessed, these are highly recommended."
3,Ho Hummm,I'm surprised Cornwell wrote this book. I'm glad I bought it on my Kindle rather than book form. I have a library of all of his books.this one would not qualify for book space.The story reminded me of Don Brown's sea mysteries.It's like play it again Sam!
1,Mr.Sands didnt quite do his homework in this book,I received this book from a freind. There is a section in the book that talks about soical security numbers. The information he is writing about it must have been 2 to 3 years behind times. You try his ideas and your he will leave you into a brick wall. Buy a different book.
4,fine Tex Ritter Western,As a kid Tex Ritter in his 1930s and 1940s Western movies was my hero. I saw these movies on television. Tex had a kind of authenticity as a cowboy and as a cowboy hero that impressed me. I still find I enjoy his Westerns more than the other period Western stars. Thus with this movie.
2,Not Elkind's Best,"Elkind, as always, makes a good case for slowing things down for kids. As a Montessori and Waldorf parent, it's always nice to read ideas in support of trusting a more organic approach to my children's development. However, I didn't feel this book had near the power of Elkind's earlier work, The Hurried Child. The book reads more like a pop psychology text. I was put off by the reiteration of his ideas regarding early childhood and left wanting more support of his theories. I also was hoping the Power of Play would suggest some examples of play and elaborations on ""what comes naturally"" to young children."
3,Interesting but old-fashioned.,"This book has a lot of good points, and is a decent reference book. However, I didn't like the prescriptive tone of the book and I find Elkind's views on technology quite old-fashioned."
4,Interesting book....,"I enjoyed this book very much and found it refreshing compared to a lot of the alternatives on the shelves...but, if you are an outdoorsy, no TV, stay at home and look after your child, play, kind of person, I didn't gain a lot from it!"
3,This was a very good book .....,"Conception Cover-Up by Karen Lawton BarrettHarlequin Intrigue # 615 - May 2001It's a stormy night, the sting goes very wrong and undercover cop, Caleb barely escapes with his life. He makes it to Shannon's remote cabin and collapses on her doorstep. Shannon patches him up and gives him shelter from the storm. As the storm rages outside, there's a storm of passion inside. In the morning, Caleb leaves to find his partner, only to discover that's he's dead and that Caleb is the prime suspect. Shannon is his alibi, and now her life and the child they just conceived is in danger.This was a very good book ... once you get past the rather early lovemaking, the story really grips you ... both Caleb and Shannon have issues that work well with the story line"
2,Conception Cover-Up by Karen Lawton Barrett,"There are a lot of holes in this story, and it doesn't flow well. The police procedures are not researched very thoroughly, and the timing of events are seriously flawed. The mystery was easily discovered, even though the facts didn't always add up, and there were a lot of unncessary information included while reading.In addition, the story starts with a character list and description when some of them are merely mentioned and never take stage in the story.I also found the romance to be a bit too flowery and unbelievable.This is a light one or two day read, that I would not recommend. Since the characters were not fully developed, the mystery pretty much ridiculous, and the read felt more like a chore. I don't think I'll give this author another try anytime soon."
2,"Great Topic, Terrible Execution","I was hoping I would like this movie. So many of my friends are frustrated with our tax code and don't understand the important history underpinning the subject matter of this film. I really wanted to like this so I could share it with my friends and educate them. But it was just....awful.Everything about the execution of this film was truly appalling. The graphics were cheesy and childish. I've seen higher quality graphics on YouTube. The subject matter was poorly organized and dragged on and on and on and on. By the end of the movie it had become monstrously repetitive. The final product definitely could've benefited from some brutal editing to cut the time and a better script for the narrative.I applaud the director for taking on this subject matter, because people who've challenged the tax code have a tendency to get audited. So kudos for that. But this is not something I would recommend to people with no existing understanding of the subject matter."
4,In relation to this theme..,"apparently SOME folks have gotten to the point, in suits brought against them by the IRS, that they deeply fear a final ruling which would set precedence-and the IRS would be destroyed.When it gets that far , when the attorney's, the Judge ask to see the statute declaring the income tax legal-they quickly drop their suit- or settle out of court-they dont want to be exposed."
5,Good expose!,"This is a good expose of how false flag operations work, and the evidence for such an operation in the form of 9-11. What about the British tube bombings and the 1 in 4 + 40 zeros chance that they randomly occurred on the same day and time as a British intelligence training at the exact same sites at the exact same times? Not likely!"
5,"Truth hurts, this film you must get and wake up others.","This legendary film maker lays it all out for the average patriotic American to understand how the TRAITORS that regulate your lives pulled the wool over the eyes of ""We the Sheeple"" long ago. You should consider doing something to take our country back or your children will grow up in the fascist police state recently created by our NON-elected, evil paedophiles. Give the gift of freedom this year to wake up other Americans while we still have the freedom to do so."
1,A great movie for fanatics,"This is a great movie for people incapable of critical thinking. It's not even good propaganda since the mish-mish of anti-government messages (the director is a libertarian, of course) are so random, incoherent, and stridently repeated that only the most ardent believer of all this claptrap would leave with a favorable opinion. The purpose of propaganda is to PERSUADE, which this movie fails to do miserably. Any person with a grain of skepticism can spot this movie for what it is: a vain attempt to appeal to people's emotions with half-truths, distortions, and deception. It's a shame, because some of the issues presented in the movie are worthy of public concern (for example, the diminishing middle class in the US, the increase in the government's ability to compromise citizens' privacy). Unless you are a conspiracy theorist, you won't think much of this movie. Do yourself a favor and skip it."
3,ITEM NOT AS PICTURED,"Only thing that came in the mail is a disc; no box, as the item is shown. Very disappointing, especially since they raised the price $3 after I put the item in my cart. Looks like they're just making copies and selling them.Content is very good, I saw it on PBS to start with. Very thought provoking."
5,This movie shows the truth that people don't want to believe.,"I am a Libertarian and a big fan of Alex Jones. This movie is the truth. The chips have already been implanted onto a florida family who wanted to implant the chip for safety reasons. National ID cards with a central database that knows everything there is to know about you is a reality. We are in a state of facism currently where government and the CIA conduct covert operations or false flag operations to realize a gain in profit for businesses, especially in the oil in dustry. Joe Banister, the IRS agent, was vindicated of IRS charges against him. His acquittal was a huge victory for every American who cares about fostering a taxing system that we can have faith in."
5,America: Freedom to Fascism,This video should be required viewing for High School Civics. This video should inspire all Americans to get involved and stay involved in their Country's government.
5,Get it,This is the one DVD you need to give to your friends. You can get it on EBAY for $1.00 and the shipping is cheap. You can buy more and get it for under a $1.00 with shipping. tell your friends buy buy buy and give give give them to everybody now. Wake up now or sleep forever. Your choice.
4,A great read aloud around Valentine's Day,"Arthur and Francine are square dancing partners in gym class. They really like dancing together. Arthur's friends begin to think that Francine likes him, because she does nice things for Arthur like giving him her favorite baseball glove. Arthur begins to believe his friends and he distances himself from Francine. The way Arthur is avoiding Francine, causes her friends to think Arthur is in love with her. She begins to distance herself from Arthur. They both get new dancing partners. When they finally confront each other, they figure out their true feelings.I am a kindergarten/first grade teacher. I read this book to my class around Valentine's Day. It is a great book for students this age. I think the students really like this book because at this age they are teased a lot about liking girls or boys. They can relate to Arthur and Francine in this book."
4,This was a gift,My husband liked this book. He is reading about Native Americans in Michigan. This book was a valuable addition to his study.
4,bernard,"Great tool, well constructed and it ripped through some range cable I was installing like butter the price was also really reasonable"
1,......uh......,"May I first say, as an adult, I love goosebumps. Stupid, cheesy, crap. But this one, the girl actress was so stupid, so ugly, and completely repulsive that I couldn't even pay attention to what was going on. Skip this one."
4,goosebumps movie,I have not had very much experience with ebay as of yet but for the little I have had it has been really good. The products are received promptly in great condition and the site is pretty easy to use. I have only had one bad experience with an item shipment but the product was also just what I had expected. I look forward to doing more business in the future.
1,Multiple Complaints,"I've had the phone a little over a year. Ever so often, if you talk for more than 30 minutes the caller can no longer hear you speaking. You can hear the person on the other end. When you hang up, the battery is dead. If you sent upright on a table but set it down a little too hard the battery knocks loose and the phone is dead. The battery then shows zero charge even if there was a full charge before it blacked out. All and all, it's a very difficult phone."
5,"Reliable, Clear Sound and Good Range","I also purchased the base station with answering machine(which is also excellent), and have now added a third handset. Phones have great, clear sound and good range and I often use the speakerphone feature in the handset so I can talk while working on the computer or have my wife join in the conversation. Only problem I've had is locating a handset after the battery runs down. The page feature obviously is no help at that point, but that's my own fault for letting the battery run down."
4,Great handset,"I really love this handset. My family has fun downloading the ringer songs. Unfortunately, there is no MAC program to download pictures"
4,Engaging for young children--and their parents!,"Although not a crisp studio recording, the spontaneity and exuberance of Ella Jenkins and the children bring an energy to this collection of lesser-known, lively sing alongs--mostly with a spiritual, blues or rock 'n roll origin. Ms. Jenkins is the premiere music performer and educator for young children--she knows just how to bring the excitement and joy of musical expression to children. You and your child will be singing along quite easily to all of these numbers--this collection is especially suited to ages 3 to 9 according to the cover, however, even babies seem to enjoy it!"
2,quality,"The boots arrived in a prompt manner, and looked just like the picture, however, they chaffed my husbands legs so badly that he cannot wear them. When I tried to contact the seller, I was told they did not have an e-mail address available. I called the phone number, but did not get an answer. They went in the garbage."
2,difficult to walk in these boots,The sides of the boots are very rigid. It's difficult to walk in them. I feel like wearing an all-metal boot.
4,Nice boot,"Nice boot for snowblowing/shoveling. True to size. Slip-on style, so they're not tight at the top. Warm enough for working outside for a few hours. Not too heavy.Overall, a good quality boot."
4,Itasca Ontario slip on boot,"For a trip to the mailbox or a 10 minute shovel job these boots are the ticket. They are warm,do not leak and most importantly are ultra easy to slip on and off. The boot pull is generous enough to accomodate a gloved finger or fingers. I've got a terrific pair of Sorels for serious outdoor work and play but all the lacing and unlacing is a time consuming task for just a simple outdoor visit. Itascas' will not outlast the pyramids, but you can't beat the price for a good value."
1,Defective - Irregular,I bought size 10 and the shoes are 11 1/2 even though label size 10. They are manufacture irregular items as it appears.
2,NOT REAL LEATHER,"These boots do NOT have leather uppers, they are synthetic. Tag inside says ""man made materials"" made in china, but description says leather uppers."
2,Disappointing.,"I've only gotten through the first dozen or so pages, but I've already found several ridiculous spelling mistakes, making the book look like a slapdash, sloppy production. That in itself is a minor thing. However, the whole book appears to be composed almost entirely of sentimental, poorly written drivel that I hesitate to call poetry--on one page is a bad poem, and on the opposite page is a blank space upon which you are presumably supposed to write your own bad poetry, all in the name of expressing your ""personal feelings"".If I wanted to read terrible formulaic rhymes, I would have gone back and looked at my own teenage verses. I had hoped this would be a much more intellectual, professional piece of work, with proven journaling techniques and thought-provoking exercises, but unfortunately that is not the case. If you have a university education and any background in/affection for truly good poetry, I would say this book is not for you."
4,HP L1940T monitor,"A good monitor. we are enjoying the larger screen. We found out later that some monitors have USB hubs on them, we have not nneded one yet but would be a good feature. For us it is a good compliment to the HP Slimline we purchased at the same time."
2,It's OK BUT 1/2 OF THE TRACKS ARE MUSIC!!!!!!!!,Hey I am a huge KoRn fan. But this CD isn't that good. 1 of the remixes has words! Get the other got the life! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!
3,Kind of good.,"This CD is an import from Australia. It features the original version of Got the Life, 2 remixes of it, and an unrelaesed song called I can remember. The Got the Life remixes aren't good @ all but the unreleased song is good."
4,Killer Kitsch,"This is a cheesy, B-movie-style collection of scary stories, the kind told around the camp fire or while waiting for the next batch of trick-or-treaters. Great for any collection of creepy fun."
1,Not the item shown,"The item shown is a clima-cool tank. You can see that on the back in the picture. The item sent, is not. It's just a rough farbic tank. I have a red version of the clima-cool tank show in the picture and it's a completely different fabric/feel."
1,Did not like it. I returned the item.,"Very rough fabric. I don't like it. My $16 Champion Running T, I bought from Target is much metter and softer.I rerurned this product to amazon anyway."
3,Man is this see through,"The white is super see through, unlike the others i bought the mesh is too far apart."
5,Sally Clarkson really speaks to the heart of mothers.,"This book is an inspiration to all mothers, especially those who are homeschooling their children. She shares her stuggles as well as her successes, with heartwarming anecdotes to which we can all relate. This book should be on the shelf of all mothers who are striving, and sometimes struggling, to give their children the best in life. It is a trusted friend in those times of dryness and discouragement. God bless Sally Clarkson for sharing herself with us."
5,Excellent book,"I have several Visio books - most are useless for developers who write VBA/VB/VC++ code for Visio automation. For those who develop for Visio, this is a must-have book. It's simply the Visio developer's bible compared to the rest. It includes sample code, appendices of events, properties and more. I wish I had known about this book before I began visio programming because it's easy to read from beginning to end and progress your skills incrementally - now I use it as a reference.He also lets you download software tools to use - one awesome one is a VB DLL/VSL adapter. But even without the extra software this book goes into more detail and depth than any other, except the Microsoft Devloper book (which is free online). And it's a great companion to the Msoft book, and covers things it doesn't. (including highlighting the bugs)All in all, an excellent book and the only one worth buying."
1,"Visio 2003 Developer's Survival Pack, NOT!","Huge disapointment. This is one of the worst technical books I have ever purchased and I wish I could have returned it. Based on its title, the book portraits itself as a guide to help Visio developers understand how to program Visio applications. It falls short on all areas: It is neither a tutorial, nor a reference guide, nor a hand-on book. I purchased the book hoping to learn how to write programs that interact with Visio. If your needs are similar to mine, do not purchase this book; you are better off using the MSDN material available over the web."
3,nothing over the top,"this collection was hit and miss. the horror slows down in alot of the parts but does a ok job. the story is made very long, but still interesting to watch. i ended up watching more to what the back story was than the horror itself. most of the movies in this collection move very slowly for scary scenes, and only pick up towards the very end. overall a normal collection of j-horror nothing over the top. 3/5 still worth it for the price and making a nice collection."
3,not as expected,"After seeing the American version and the Korean one, I wanted to finally see the original sage.To say it quickly, the first is great and sets the story well and proved why the remakes were done.The sequels (Rasen and Ringu 2) though left me with a bad taste. They took the mystique out from the first one and tried to go at another level but simply failed and felt like they were written by a student that wanted to push his direction to it instead of following the story of the first one. Rasen is truly more guilty of this.Ringu 0 was also a let down. More of a rehashed retelling of the legend/origin of the first one, which added all sort of stuff that just were make up so to make a new movie.This movie (the original) had a LOT of potential and I find that all the sequels failed to capture the story and essence behind it."
4,It could also be ...,"In response to the speculation of what exactly this is:DVD Journal notes that on August 23rd, both ""Ringu 2"" and ""The Ring Two"" will be released on DVD. It is possible that this 4 DVD ""Anthology"" is Ringu, Ringu 2, The Ring, and The Ring Two."
4,GOOD MOVIES,"WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT RINGU I HURRIED AND RENTED IT FIRST I WENT ON AMAZON AND FROM OTHER REVIEWS THEY SAW THAT YOU WATCH THEM IN A CERTAIN ORDER SUCH AS RINGU, RASEN, RINGU TWO, AND THEN RINGU 0. i TRUSTED THE REVIEWS AND ENDED UP GETTING VERY CONFFUSED. tHE REAL ORDER THAT YOU WATCH THEM IN IS RINGU, RINGU0, RASEN, AND THEN RINGU0. bUT OVERALL i THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE PRETTY GOOD"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,I keep this refrigerator in my back hall. It's purpose was to hold a few bottles of water so I wouldn't have to go into the kitchen with shoes that were dirty from doing yardwork. What a waste of money! The water is barely cooler than room temperature.
2,Not a good mini-fridge,If this fridge kept things COLD I would have liked it...but then again that is pretty much all I am looking for in a mini-fridge...therefore not a good fridge at all. I bought it for like 70 bucks and had to sell it for 20 because it sucked. At least I got something back right? :)
1,Maybe it's a Tampa Thing,"I have this out on my back porch so maybe I'm expecting too much, but my old fridge worked great till the compressor quit. I thonk this doesn't even have a compressor (i.e. it's ""cfc free"") so it just can't do the job. drinks inside are maybe kept at 60F and that's on the coldest setting. Worthless."
1,Frosts up,"As others have noted, this is a thermoelectric cooler so really doesn't get that cold. However- it DOES get cold enough for form ice on the cooling unit. If your fan is noisy, it may be due to it striking the ice. If you remove the plastic shield over the fan (four screws) you can see it. It is actually a large PC case fan! You can see ice buildup. Just defrost by turning it off, put a towel in the bottom to collect the water. You'll get some performance back, but it will still be lame, just less lame."
1,Unreliable - be wary!,I presented four of these coolers to four Nuns in a Convent (9 months ago) to keep beverages cool (i.e. not refrigerated) and I just replaced another unit with a another brand yesterday. I am very disappointed in these Chefmate 'thermo electrically' cooled units. I will not purchase another chefmate cooler until the technology becomes more reliable.
1,POS,"This is a thermoelectric cooler, not what you would normally think of as a refrigerator.It keeps the inside temp about 25F cooler than the outside temp, which means about 50F in a 75F room.It isn't really cool enough to function as a refrigerator, or even to cool drinks. A 50F soda is cool but not cold.It is very quiet, but it just isn't cold enough to be of any use."
4,"Good, economicly priced refrigerator","I am surprised by the negative comments on this item, I had this refrigerator for my college dorm room, I felt that it was great for that purpose. It still works, whereas I know other refrigerators which fail. I also like the adjustable temperature, great price, good buy!"
4,It's Fine. No Problems.,"This refrigerator is just fine for an office (where I have it), a dorm room, or other similar use. In 3 years of use, I have had no problems with keeping things cold. I like the design as well, because unlike some small ""cube"" refrigerators, it will accommodate a tall bottle. Also, the exterior finish is reasonably professional looking and unobtrusive, which is a considerable plus in an office environment.Keep in mind that this is a refrigerator and not a freezer. The ice tray area is pretty much a joke. But if you want to keep some beverage cans cold or have a place to put your lunch, this is a good choice."
3,Looks soo uncomfortable!,"This pack 'n play is easy to set up and store away, but I found the mattress to be so uncomfortable for the baby. The baby tends to 'sink' towards the center of the bed which makes it really awkward to sleep in."
5,Love it!,"I bought this for my daughter almost 6 months ago, we use it everyday, move it around everyday around the house, it has helped us like a second crib on our first floor. I didnt want to spend too much money or have too many features on the playpen, and this best fits my needs. The only thing I have never tried and may never is the ease of folding and unfolding the set.I use the boppy pillow in this set, to let her sit as she loves sitting for long times, so some extra support, so she plays with her toys, sitting most of the time. I felt its totally worth the money.I personally think you dont need fancy mobiles and diapers sacks, for this one. Its pretty basic and simple, that works out fine for the baby."
4,Bad odor,"There was a terrible odor once the item was removed from the box. It was almost like a mildew kind of smell.It was easy to set up. Took about 15 minutes.The pattern was cute. The top pad/mattress was sturdy. Once it was set up,I washed the entire item to see if the odor would go away.It didnt.If not for the sickening smell, i'm sure the pack n play would have served its purpose. I got a refund from amazon."
5,Good buy,"Great price, easy to put together, and now the grandsons have a place to sleep when they visit."
4,"Good Product over all, Fast and timely delivery","gave it only 4 stars,The Graco Pack N Play Playard with Bassinet, Pasadena came with a thinly made ""mattress"" which consisted of a piece of cardboard covered with fabric. Would highly suggest purchasing the Dream On Me 3"" Foam Playard Mattress for the playard. It fit perfectly.Hanging toy bar consisted of (3) stuffed fabric stars - which attached flimsily with small strip of Velcro.All in all, effective as a travel bed, good colors, but no frills."
5,Easy to assemble and disassemble!,So easy to put up and put away. Sturdy enough for my 10 month old to play in. I love it!
4,Great basic pack and play,"Color exactly as picture shows, great basic pack and play. Easy to set up easy to take down and store"
5,terrrrrifc!,"This is an excellent item. Our office purchased it for a baby shower gift and had fun putting it up. When you've done it once, it is so easy! It looks good and seems to be vey sturdy. We piled presents in it and we were so proud to give it. The upcoming parents are really happy with it. Especially when they saw how easy it is to take down and put back up. I highly recommend this product. I also believe that the price was very good. I've seen others in the store that didn't look as nice and were more expensive."
5,Pack and play,Good playpen to get if you just plan to use it for sleeping and then for playing. It gets the job done. You don't need all the extras on the playpen. Line the changing table. You will rarely use that.
5,Just what grandma needed,I was looking for a pack 'n play that did not have all the add-ons - just something sturdy and easy to fold up when not in use - for my grandchildren to sleep in when they come over. This fits the bill perfectly. I am very happy with this model.
4,Great choice,"We ordered this for our third child and we love it. It was easy to set up, does not take up too much space and is very sturdy. Great color for girl or boy. (We have a girl.)"
4,Very portable,This product is great to take with you when visiting family members and staying overnight. Wasn't crazy about the color but otherwise it's OK.
2,"Mattress is too soft, flimsy","My wife had this item on her baby shower registry and it was one of the few items we got without researching fully first. Everything I've read when buying cribs is a FIRM mattress is the best way to reduce suffocating/SIDS risks. The ""mattress"" that comes with this pack & play is much softer than the one in our crib, and very lumpy and bendable. It feels like it is 4 pieces of hard cardboard with foam on top. My sister's pack and play mattress is much sturdier - it feels like particle board underneath and does not bend and sag under moderate pressure like this unit. We will be returning it this weekend and shopping at a brick and mortar store just so we can touch the mattress first before buying. Very disappointing since I'd much rather buy everything from Amazon."
3,Graco Pack 'N Play,"I ordered this playpen so my grandchildren would have one at my home. I babysit my granddaughter daily and I don't feel the mattress is really very sturdy. If it had a little more support, I would love it. Guess I should have spent more money..."
2,No support in the middle,"I was excited when I receive this product. I have had this product and been using it 2.5mths now and very disappointed. The bassinet sunk in the middle with the weight of the baby. My daughter was born at 5lbs 11oz and is now at 10lbs, so it is not a heavy baby. She sleeps in it only at night and no other time. The bassinet has for parts that lay cross section of playyard and the middle two has sunken. It looks very uncomfortable watching my daughter sleep in it as her head then straddles the groove which is flat to the one which is sunken. It is unfortunate that this product was not engineered to consider the support required for the middle. I will post a picture of this as soon as I can."
5,Graco pack n play playard,Love the way this folds. Did not even need instructions. Great price for this item. I would recommend this pack n play to everyone.
2,Can't count the # of pinched fingers I've gotten,[...]I don't know how many times my fingers have gotten caught in the pack `n play when I am trying to break it down and unlock the sides. I thought this thing was suppose to be for convenience not butchering your fingers?! How many of you have gotten ouchies from a pack `n play ? I'm just glad little fingers are not strong enough to unlock the sides and get their fingers caught!
5,Graco Pack N Play,"The Pack N Play Playard is fine. This was a baby shower gift, and the box this came in was embarrassing."
1,Perfect for Gramma's house,"perfect for visits from Grandbaby. Easy to assemble. Takes little space. Wheels easily from room to room. Serves as a dressing table and crib now, and will convert to a playpen as baby gets bigger. Basic features, very functional. Absolutely worth the reasonable price."
5,I'm a believer,"Sturdy construction. I bought this because I hoped I wouldn't have to buy Crib and this would serve as a dual purpose option. Best decision ever. It is spacious, and the bassinet is 5 cm taller than the crib I was thinkingabout so this was even better. It is better to get this model over one with the changing table since I have found that they are not as sturdy as one might think. Overall great buy. Highly recommend."
3,direccion de envio errada,"la direccion que se coloco estaba errada y el producto se envio a un destino equivocado,necesito sea enviado a miami 8536 l.w.66s st miami florida 33166"
5,Just what we were looking for,We need a pack-n-play for our vacation home. This was perfect. It is easy to put up and take down. Easy to store. Very sterdy. Our 8 month old daughter slept in it - no problem. It was just what we were looking for.
2,You get what you pay for,I was very disappointed in this pack n play. The mat that you lay inside once the frame is set up does not lay straight. Instead you get a lumpy uneven surface which could be in my opinion a suffocation hazard. I am surprised this model has not been recalled for this reason. Save your money and get a different model.
4,Good for the price!,"This pack and play is great for the price. I enjoy the bassinet feature, and it is easy to clip in and take out. The mobile could be better and my mattress doesn't lay flat, but overall my baby can take naps in it just fine!"
5,"Perfect ""crib"" for Grandma's house","Just had my first grandchild in September. This was recommended over any other product by anyone I asked. It sets up easily, breaks down just as easily and quickly. Its versatility is very clever. It's been nearly 30 years since we've had a baby in the house and I'm amazed at the wonderful products available today!"
5,perfect,"I bought this as my Grandma's house crib. It was easy to put up and my granddaughter sleeps hours in it when I have her, so it must be comfortable. And it is the perfect size for my guest bedroom!"
2,Mattress bunches up,"Maybe ours was a dud, but the mattress bunches up after putting on sheets, causing a large bump right in the middle. It's impossible to place our child sleeping not on the bump, so I imagine sleeping in the Pack 'N Play isn't very comfortable for him. Fortunately we are only using it on trips."
5,So Far So Good,Purchased this item as a shower gift for my grand daughter that will be born in a few months so it's a little early to say how it work. I do know that mom-and-dad-to-be really like the colors and functionality and said it was easy to assemble. The best part is it was shipped to Germany via an APO address and arrived in 7 days which amazed me. Even by choosing the free shipping it arrived in time for the baby shower. Amazing!
4,Comfort and Ease,"Great for the money, works just like any other pack and play and my sweet one slept just fine in it. Has the bassinet insert but not the changing table add on. Would recommend getting one with this feature after using it, much easier on your back and more stable than I thought. This one was just perfect though for the in-laws' house which is where it will stay!"
4,All you need,"Great playpen- all you need and the design is simple and pretty. I use this for my son, but I would use it for a girl as well as the color is more of a blue/green. We used the bassinet attachement as well for a bit while waiting for our bassinet to come in, it did its purpose, but it did sag a bit in areas after only a few weeks, so I would not recommend this to use for a full 3 months as a bassinet. VERY portable and easy to use and I get a lot of compliments on it. Everyone else I spoke to that bought a playpen with more options, wishes they did not b/c they never use any of the options and it made theirs harder to store and travel with."
2,ok- but wouldn't buy it again,"We liked this product intially and the price was fair, but after only 3mos of occasional usage one of the sides broke/won't latch."
5,graco pack and play with bassinet,Very easy to put up and take down for visits from the grandkids. Love this product!
4,Perfect for Auntie's Home When Baby Visits,"My extended family is delighted that I have the playard when they visit with their newborn. I like it, because it's attractive--and I can fold it up and store in a closet. It's easy to put together and break down. Yes, it's all plastic parts; but what isn't nowadays? The unit is bright and cheery, sturdy with no raw edges, and the carrying weight for portability is reasonable. Its best features are that it's sturdy and safe, along with the wheels for moving it around. The layette accessory snaps easily into place, but when it's time to store it away, it's lacking a design for where to put it. Ditto for the mobile attachment, which has to be disassembled (a challenge!) and put somewhere too."
1,Not Sturdy for a 16lb infant,"I received this as a registry item. I am very disappointed in the product. I only just opened it b/c my daughter is beginning to learn to crawl and we need a safe location for her while we get ready in the morning or cook dinner. Unfortunately b/c the mattress is so flimsy and she doesn't crawl yet, she falls over very easily (even with a boppy to hold her up). The mattress bends both ways and does not use the legs to support it. I am looking to replace or return this item. The bassinet (which we never used) is a little more sturdy b/c of the metal bars, but she's too big and pulls herself over to the edge and could pull herself up and over.My sister has a great pack and play (at my mom's) where the bottom does not bend the opposite direction, which I think makes it a ton more sturdy.Very disappointed."
2,Mattress Sucks,"It's cute enough, but the mattress is terrible. My baby somehow bent the ""boards"" with his weight (9-10 lbs) and it didn't lie flat. We ended up putting support under the mattress which you're probably not supposed to do, but it helped a lot. I probably wouldn't buy this one again. I had a similar one with my daughter and it was fine, so I'm not sure what the deal is."
4,Cute but a pain to put together.,"I bought this as a gift for my sister. When I went to put it together, the sides wouldn't lock in place. I looked for the directions and couldn't find them, so my neighbor came over to help me.FYI... you have to make sure the P&P; isn't flat at the bottom when trying to lock the sides. Just pull up on the strap in the center of the ""floor"" of P&P.; Also, I found the instructions after my neighbor left...in a pouch that is attached to the mattress."
5,Great product for the price,"I looked at several portable playards, most over $125, but this had the basic features I wanted at a great price. The full size bassinet is great for my twins, they both fit in there with room to spare. If you are just looking for something basic with no fuss, look no further. It is easy to set up, and sturdy."
1,strong chemical smell,"I bought this one because I had read about the strong smell of some of the other Graco pack and play porducts online, and I had seen no such reviews for this one. MY mistake! this one too stinks so badly that I get headaches. God knows what it'll do to a little baby, so I returned it.Oh and it probably won't fit through your doors unless you pack it."
3,A littly flimsy,"I ordered this Graco pack n' play to replace one that I had that I was very satisfied with. Unfortunately, they were not exactly the same. The mattress is not as sturdy as my other one and my daughter is constantly lifting it up and bending it back and even sitting under it. Don't know why this one is of lesser quality and not quite sure why one differs from the other but they did. The rest of it is ok, the colors were nice and soft."
3,Not so great.,"I do not like the Graco Pack 'N Play. My Mom borrowed two for our visit so that I didn't have to bring mine, (two so that there would be one upstairs and one downstairs)and I do not like them at all. The bottom isn't very solid and the sides squeak and creak! I'm short so I can't bend over the side without leaning on it a little bit, and my son is a light sleeper, so every time I try to lay him down I have to be VERY careful not to hit the side or it creaks and wakes him up. It's decent, I guess. Does the job, keeps my son contained. But could be better. I have theEddie Bauer Vanderbilt Complete Care Play Yardat home and the bottom is more solid and the sides do not creak."
5,Loved it!,"My little one slept on the bassinet part for almost 4 months and she really liked it. She's a small baby so it didn't feel so overwelmingly big like a crib would. The thing I would say is the mattress is slightly thin and I searched everywhere for a mattress topper but couldnt find one. It did also sag a little towards the end, but we did use it everyday! She didn't seem to mind though.I found that the cream colored graco quilted sheet fit really well on the mattress. It was really snug and didn't leave any gaps. I would highly recommend this as a safe sleep option for your child. For the price you can't go wrong!"
5,Graco Pack 'n Play w/Bassinet,"This was a gift for my daughter who is expecting her third child this month so we haven't open the box yet, but was shipped on time and package came in excellent condition."
1,Do not buy! Mattress is horrible and expensive to replace!!!!,"We bought a pack n play for our first baby, she slept in the bassinet part for the first 4 months or so, poorly, I might add. Then a year and a half later, we are setting it up for our newest baby due in a few weeks, and the mattress has a giant bend in the middle that will not flatten out, it isn't safe for a newborn to sleep on, it's all bunched up and you can't even get a sheet on it. We only used it for that first four months and then a little bit of play pen time, maybe 10-15 times. This is soooo poorly made. Went to GRACO webiste for a replaement and of course it is OUT OF STOCK! hahah, that's because everyone has to buy one. Buying another pad from another company to fit it is nearly $40!!! Such a mistake, I really do not advise anyone to buy any of the GRACO pack n plays....find another atlternative."
3,Would like it better if the mattress didnt shake everytime baby moves,"My son wont sleep in his pack and play because he moves around alot and only being 11 weeks, weve tried to use it on multiple occasions but he just wont stay asleep in it. When he moves his arms or his legs the whole bassinet part will shake waking him up. We dont have a crib yet because im picky and haven't found a white one that I am in love with just yet, but I am hoping he will sleep in that because it wont move when he does. As for now were using a Snugglenest and hes co-sleeping with us. And during naps he will sleep just fine on our bed, So i dont know what is up with the pack and play but I wished it worked as a bassinet better."
1,Frustrated,"So I had this on my registry on another site, and am sad to say that each time I rec'd this product (3x within the span of a week) the mattress was defective. I contacted Graco, and they told me that they could get me a new mattress in over a month... anyway, I'm frustrated with the mattress pad because it has several dents the size of a baby's head, which seems like a huge suffocation risk! There is no way I would let my baby sleep on this. I am hoping that there are other pack and plays that do not have mattress pads that are lumpy and saggy. I'm now wondering if I should go with another brand or another model?"
4,Does it's purpose,"I registered for this and received it as a gift because I thought I just needed a playard with a bassinet. It's great and easy to put together and take apart. It'll be great for travel and it's pretty compact when folded up. I just wished I registered for a pack 'n play with a changer now though!!! No fault to Graco, but I wished they had it available as an accessory or add on. :( Just know what you want before you buy it! They have so many different pack 'n plays in all sorts of designs and colors!"
4,Graco Kensley Pack n Play,"Great job by Amazon to get this to me 3 days after my order was placed. This is a basic, no frills Pack n Play, which is what this Grandy wanted, and the price was good. It was easy to set up and put away, and yet seems very sturdy. It will be perfect for when grandchildren come to visit."
5,Cute pattern GREAT price,I love the Lively Dots pattern. It is so cute and will go good with a girl or boy. Very easy set up. I really like the raised bottom for when you have an infant. It can also hold some weight. I had my newborn in it when my 2 1/2 year old decided to join her (we had it next to our bed so he just climbed in). He laid next to her and it held them both very well. (Not that I would recommend having them both in there). We told him it was her bed and he had to just look at her. :)Overall LOVE this product!!! Highly recommend it. Think the little hanging bear heads are pointless though. I just left them off.
4,Fits nicely at the inlaws and on our boat too,"This is invaluable when you want to be mobile. I am not great with mechanical things and I assembled it all by myself. It is great, and I'm so happy with this purchase. The price is very fair too! This will get plenty of use after our baby is big enough to play IN it too! We aren't positive if we want our baby to sleep with us for the first little while, which is why we got this pack n play with the built in bassinet. We don't need a full changing table or any of the other fancy stuff the more expensive versions come with, so this was just what we needed. It's small enough to fit through our friends doors and pretty easy to move around because of the wheels and the fact that it is not too heavy."
4,Excellent product,This is great pack and play - confy for my 9mos old and easy for me to pack and set up. This is the second Graco pack and play I have bought - we bought this one specifically to keep at the Grandparents and for travel.Using it for travel has revealed the only flaw I can find with the pack and play - no handle on the storage bag. The pack and play breaks down easily and smoothly fits into its storage case - but carrying the pack and play in the case is cumbersome and awkward. If Graco could add a shoulder strap to the storage bag - this product would be perfect. :)
4,good if your baby uses it,"Good bassinet /pack and play if your baby uses it. My baby would not sleep in the bassinet , she preferred to sleep in bed next to me so we did not use it much. Otherwise, good sized and sturdy, good buy!!"
4,Happy so far,We have taken our pack n play on two trips with our 2 month old and have been very happy with it so far.
4,Pretty good,"I think for the price this is a great pack n play. The ""mattress"" is my only complaint. It is four board-like pieces that are unattached from each other with foam over them. The problem was it was difficult to lay it completely flat. It kept wanting to buckle at the joints between boards. Once I messed with it I did get it to lay flat, just make sure the sheet you use is big enough or it will cause it to buckle. This is not the sturdiest model pack n play, but for the price it is great. My daughter slept in this while on vacation and she seemed comfortable."
5,GREAT!,"I almost spent 200$ on the bjorn travel ones or the 4moms one...ridiculous, this one is perfect, just as easy to use, seriously great price!"
4,"Great little PnP, good for small spaces","This pack and play is perfect for small spaces and very easy to move around. We are currently using it as a bassinet for our baby, and it fits perfectly in our bedroom. We found it to be quite sturdy and good quality. The bassinet pad is very hard, and I bought a bassinet pad from Babies R Us to use in it, and it fits perfectly."
3,"not bad, but...","I received the pack and play and it set up without issues. It's extremely cute!! However, after fitting a sheet to the mattress that was designed for the pack and play, the mattress has developed lumps on where it folds and i can't get the lumps to go away. Needless to say i'm probably going to have to buy a pad of some sort so that the surface is even. I can't imagine laying my son on the lumps and how uncomfortable it might be. Overall not a bad item and fits through doorways great."
2,"Not for extended use, mattress warps","We received this as a gift and have been using it as a bed for our baby for several months now. At first we liked it and he seemed comfortable, but now the bottom of the mattress has warped horribly and is completely unusable. I didn't realize immediately how bad it had really become, but there are serious hills and valleys, I feel awful for our poor baby. If we had only wanted to use this as a bed every now and then for brief trips or occasional visitors it might have been alright, but this was clearly not designed for everyday use."
5,Safety first,My daughter now has 4 Graco Pack 'N Play for her daycare business. They are well made and can easily be set up or put away.They meet all the standards of safety when her center is inspected.
4,Great for visiting Nana!!,"Bought for ""Nana's house"" for my new grand daughter... I would definitely recommend it! ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----- --"
5,"Great pack n play, great price","Super easy set up. I didn't even have to read the instructions. Very simple, very cute and you just can't beat the price."
2,Graco Pack 'n Play Portable Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,"Graco makes great products, but this one was not up to par. The main problem was that this particular Pack 'n Play doesn't have the four corner tabs that the floor sort of snaps into. When our very petite daughter would stand at the edge, her weight would cause the floor to slip and she would slowly drop a few inches down. Life threatening? No. But it was not very stable. I assumed all Pack n' Play products had the corner tabs that make for a secure floor. We ended up purchasing another Graco model and it has been perfect."
3,"love PNPs, but small problem...","I love Pack N Plays, but this one is not solid on the bottom. Its as if the fabric is too tight and the mattress doesn't rest on the bottom completely. So, it's loose and the panels of the mattress are uneven and unsteady. We still use it, but I'm a bit disappointed. Fabric is great, and it packs up smaller than the older models. But the uneven, floating mattress is frustrating."
5,Good buy!,"We're very pleased with this purchase. I was able to get it for $60 on amazon, $10 cheaper than store, plus with amazon prime got free shipping, which it would cost me $10 in gas, at least, to drive to the store to get it so it was a good buy. Easy to put up and take down. A regular size crib wont fit in the room, and a mini one is too expensive, so we use this as her crib, it fits perfectly. The colors and toy bar fit the baby decor, it a giraffe and two green leaves. The lil pad does not sit/stay as flat as it seems it should but I've found it not to make any difference when baby is laying on it. Also plan on using it as a play pen when baby gets a bit bigger. Next I have to find a fitted sheet to fit it. Granimals playyard fitted sheets dont, fyi :)"
3,Basic travel bed,"I really like the colors of this piece. It's definitely gender neutral and not baby pastel, which I've always hated. It feels very sturdy and safe. However this one does not have the handy reach through hole that allows you to collapse it without removing the bassinet layer. If you are going to be moving it from room to room when your LO is really little, I'd suggest finding one that has this feature. The toy bar on this is a joke. The little stars Velcro on and are not engaging at all. In fact if you look at them from the baby's angle they're even worse. The worst part of them is that there isn't even a loop so you can hang other toys; it is just a strip of fabric with Velcro on it. Overall, effective as a travel bed, good colors, but no frills."
5,Awesome for a boy!,"This pack-n-play is AWESOME for our son! NOT only did we use it when he was first born, but we also use it now that he is moving around a lot and crawling as a place for us to put him while we get ready in the morning if one of us is not on the bed with him! He loves it and so do we ! Thanks!"
4,Great Value!,"We looked at several. This is the best Pack 'n Play for the $59 we paid. Fast delivery. It does not have all the extras (like a changing table or outragous mobiles, shade cover) but we were not interested in paying for stuff we did not want. I appears to be very similar (if not the same) as many others, with less buttons and whistles and at a better price."
5,Graco Pack n' Play,It is beautiful just what I ordered. Was sent on time and arrived without any nick or dings in box. Easy to set up and put away. I like the fact that it folds up into a small bag. It won't take up much room.
5,Great Product,"We're traveling and needed a new temporary crib. In terms of value for money this is amazing. It's not that light so I wouldn't go walking around with it, but if you're going on a car trip for a few days or more it takes up the size of a small suitcase and once you get the hang of it is very easy to fold and unfold. Overall I was really impressed by the product, the baby is comfortable inside and the basinet is a really useful option for those with baby's who aren't climbing yet. Quality is great and you can tell the manufacturer didn't skip out in safety and durability."
4,Nice!,"I just purchased the Graco Pack n Play w/Bassinet yesterday based on the reviews here and I must say that I am quite pleased with the product. It appears to be sturdy, it is a nice size and was an absolute breeze to set up (super-duper easy). I did notice like a few other reviewers that the bassinet board is somewhat hard (i added an extra thick blanket to make it a bit more plush) and I noticed that the bassinet board does concave slightly in the middle so I'm sure that buyers will need to adhere to weight restrictions of 15lbs (the playard itself has a weight limit of 35lbs). This is also extremely easy to fold up and is quite compact which will make it useful when traveling. Can easily fit into a standard size trunk or in the back seat of a small car.Very nice AND useful product! Way to go, Graco!"
3,broke in three months,"i liked it before a small metal part came out of the locking mechanism, now i don't feel safe putting the baby in there. and the thing won't go back in("
3,Beware of 3 Day Window Shipping Policy,"I ordered this Graco Pack N Play Playard to use as a gift. The Graco Playard is a wonderful product, but I found out FOUR (4) days after ordering that the recipient already had one. When I checked to see about returning the product, there was a notice that there was a return window of THREE (3) days from when the order was PLACED to return it and get full credit. I received the playard after 6 pm on day TWO (2). This is vastly different from the stated return policy for baby items in the help section."
3,Noah's Ark fabric pattern,"I just opened up the box and was surprised to find that the fabric print is noah's ark, which certainly wouldn't have been our first choice since we aren't religious. I thought it was probably worth posting this info for others since I can't see that it says so or shows it clearly on this ordering page."
3,Should'a - could'a - would'a,"At my first glance, I was converted. Where I made this mistake is, I did not look around and compare pricing. Found the same unit with additional accessories for less of the price."
5,Very nice,"I love my pack n play. It was easy to set up. It is light weight and easily moved around to accomodate the opportunities that I get to babysit my first granddaughter. I look forward to at least a year of use, maybe more. Who knows, I could have the opportunity to host another new grandchild a little later on. All is good."
4,!Viva Orestes!,"A fine enough session on it's own, but Orestes Vilato makes this a four star date. Changuito is in much better form here than recent live performances."
5,"The perfect ""gift""",I hope they don't discontinue the publication of this book as it is perfect for any young lady that is close to your heart - I gave it to my niece for her college graduation.
5,A great read!,"Excellent book that details Lou Henson's rise from humble beginnings to the top of the collegiate basketball coaching profession. Lou was a master at working with young people and is recommended reading for any leader of young people, be it coaches, teachers, or parents."
3,"Luiz Melodia, o Felino","Luiz Melodia is a seldom discussed (outside of Brazil at least) singer with a rich beautiful voice and fantastic song writing skills. Over his long career he has not flooded the market with albums, and each one has its points of interest. Being a fan, I had to add Felino, his 1983 album to my collection. Overall the album is a bit slick and slightly cheezy as were the production values of the time, but there are a handful of tracks that make it worthwhile. There is a beautiful Joao Donato produced track ""Sorri pra Bahia"" which is drenched in the sound of his best productions, with beautiful female vocal chorus. There is also the very catchy boogie title track tune."
3,"Interesting recipes, but...","As the owner of a home-based Bath and Body Products business, I am always on the look out for new recipes to try, adapt, etc. Although there are some fabulous sounding recipes in this book, the use of hydrosols, Sea Berry and Rose Hip Seed Co2 (had never heard of them before, ever) make them way too complicated and expensive for someone who just wants to learn how to put together some simple cosmetics at home. Some of the ingredients, waxes in particular, I'd never even heard of. Perhaps someone living in the U.S. would have an easier time acquiring the ""exotics,"" but my excellent Canadian suppliers do not sell them. I also am not keen on her use of Borax in recipes as it can be a sensitizer for some people and there are gentler preservatives on the market one can use. I can't say I'm completely disappointed, but a strong word of caution to those thinking that they'll find easy ""first timer"" recipes in here -- they won't."
2,Regret buying,"This book is not for a novice. I have been making soap for family and friends and I have quite an array of fixed and essential oils but I find many of the key ingredients are hard to find or are very expensive. She uses absolutes, hydrosals, and expensive essential oils like roman chamomile.If you don't want to spend a lot of money or are new to making homemade cosmetics, do not buy this book."
3,Informative to a degree,"Donna Maria's book was fairly informative as to properties of various ingredients she uses in lotion making, but I concur with all other reviewers who said it was frustrating. The formulas in the book are made from obscure ingredients, most of which need to be purchased online, are very costly, or need bulk purchases. She measures everything in grams, which I can do, but with my old scale could not. I'm an experienced soapmaker for many years, and so I am very familiar with many of the ingredients and processes she uses. I was hoping for more information on preservatives ( a very hot topic when discussing ""natural"" cosmetics.). I also noticed, after making 4 creams from the book, that while she calls some of them lotions, every one I made was a very very thick cream. Nothing I could pump from a bottle. They felt nice, but not a lot of variety as to consistency."
2,Book,Lot's of ingredient's were hard for me to find. It was too time consuming for me but it could of been just me.
2,dissapointing,"The book gives great information on the basic ingredients for lotions , but theres no ""SIMPLE beginners recipe"" in here, except perhaps at the end in the ""Beauty Food"" chapter.many of the recipes make such a small amount of lotion that youre measuring infintessimal amounts of ingredients.I would have preferred to see a couple of simpler recipes included, using perhaps one or two easily available oils rather than a half dozen oils that all have to be specially ordered.At the end of the book I find myself thnking, hmmm. I'm so glad this isnt the first book I read on how to make lotions and etc.My final take on it is , Great if youre looking for inspiration, not so great if you think this will bring you the easy starter recipes ."
2,Anticipation turned to Frustration:,"A well written book that I specially ordered after briefly looking through a copy. When I received the book anticipation turned to frustration as I read recipe after recipe that needed very expensive ingredients which are almost impossible to find. The frustration builds as I realize that to utilize the book I would need not just a few expensive ingredients but many different ones. Also, for many of the recipes there are no alternative ingredients listed for the ones I was allergic to. The recipes that are good for only one or two applications would on occassion be a treat but not practical for everyday use. If you have the time, money and most importantly suppliers for the special ingredients than this book could very well be a delight."
2,not realistic,"I found the formulas to be too exotic. Most of the ingredients are very expensive. I was also dissapointed that natural preservatives were not discussed. The thought of someone keeping their lotion in the refrigerator is an inconvenience. I want to sell my concoctions, and that can't be done without preservatives."
3,"nice, but no new information for me","I'm not a novice in making homemade creams. I had no problems with finding ingredients, but the recipes are too easy for me. And I don't like using borax in home cosmetics. Donna Maria uses it in many recipes.But I liked wery much the section with several balm bars recipes. The information on the other handmade cosmetics makers throughout the book was also very useful and interesting."
2,Very difficult to get ingredients,"I got this book and 'Earthly Bodies & Heavenly Hair' for Christmas and I have to say I haven't used this book once. Nearly everything I needed for recipes in 'Earthly bodies' I got from the local Whole foods but with this book I stopped at the first recipes and couldn't find one thing. I'm sure it would result in nice lotions and creams but without the ingredients I will never know. Kind of sad but at least I got the other book, which I love and really recommend."
2,Kind of a wierd book...,"This book is not exactly what I expected. While the author is obviously knowledgeable, the information in the book is organized in somewhat of a confusing fashion and the recipes are often complicated. Some of the raw ingredients required are obscure and hard to find. Ultimately I think that this book would only appeal to a pretty small niche market."
2,looking for more,"a sanitized justification for the experiment. While I enjoyed the insights gained, I was much more interested in the human interaction, foibles, fights and sex among the human participants. A long space voyage and colonization requires humans to interact with humans. How did they cope, little on this subject. Great experiment, to bad it is not being continued as this will be our outpost on the moon. David Doremus"
3,Disappointed,For this price ($40/ sheet) I expected this sheet to be luxuriously soft and supple. But it is not as nice as my lower thread count Wamsutta sheets which I love. May return this. The one upside is that the elastic goes all the way around and the coverage at the corners is very deep for a thick mattress. But could be silkier.
5,Not problematic,"Those who are actually familiar with tantra know that certain generation practices may entail generating oneself as a consort regardless of one's current external gender. So for those who find the idea of polarity confusing - fear not, you have all the yab and all the yum you need regardless of what hangs betwixt thy knees. I cannot say more on this. In general, this book does wonders to correct the silly ideas regarding the relationship between gender versus sexuality (they ARE different you know) and the difference between inner channels and outer physical genitalia. Well, this book does that if you can read between the lines. The book makes much more sense if you have a background in both the shared and exceptional teachings. This book adds to the massive collection of evidence that says no gay practitioner should EVER doubt that his or her body, speech, and mind are a suitable basis for every possible realization. So go practice! The other shore awaits!"
1,not what i was looking for.,not what i was looking for and it was in the shape it was said to be in. to bad it was not more.
3,Good read for a Gay novice,"For anyone unfamilar with various Gay sexual activities or the theory of Tantra, this book can be enlightening. For anyone seeking revelatory practices or ideas, it is disappointing."

1,Problematic,"Everyone is worthy of compassionate understanding. Some people are just constituted differently. Nevertheless, re-writing this book to serve the gay community is problematic, when the underlying premise of the original (Tibetan) text was the ultimate union of the 'yab-yum' (Tibetan equivalent of yin-and-yang) - the 'male' and 'female' principles in the cosmos. Does it make any sense, when viewed as a union of two 'yabs' or two 'yums'? Without 'yab-yum' - none us could be born in the first place, the same applies to the phenomenal universe. How much so, then, must the ultimate union embrace finding ourselves in a 'union of the opposites.' Can you have a magnet, with two 'north poles' or two 'south poles'? Wil your electrical utilities work, with two positive or two negative wires? We all know the answer to that."
1,this guy was a mobster turned snitch,he is suspected of trying to kill his own son and before that trying to snitch on him to the cops. no wonder nobody in his family in milwaukee wisconsin will talk to him. He went to his own brother's funeral and tried to steal his estate from his nephew. Not only that this jerk wouldn't even send his grandchildren a birthday or christmas card. doesn't sound very christian like to me. sounds like a fake. And I should know I am his daughter in law!maybe this jerk should just go to church and pray and stop pretendingto be such a good person.
5,Fabulous,"This book is nothing but AWESOME starting with the detailed cover flowing through the most vibrant pages one could ever image in a book. As a up and coming Professional Wedding Planner this book was helpful mentally and spiritually. It's not just pretty pages, and flawless creativity but D. Valentine also tells her story of how she came up in the industry starting out with nothing but accomplished a lot. This is a must add to your collection if you are getting married or interested in pursuing event planning."
4,What a find!,This is quite the find! I bought it because I was intrigued by the cover. I was pleasantly surprised by what I found inside. Well written and a delight to read. The pictures are just beautiful. I got some awesome ideas for my upcoming wedding.
4,Dianne Valentine has capture the wedding bliss in a book.,This book has capture everything about wedding planning any bride could ever need. However if Dianne Valentine ideas are more on the expensive end my advice would be to just down size her ideas to what is suitable for your pockets. It is great and informative book in my opinion.

2,Bad kit. Expensive for cheaply made contents.,"The Bad:-Traveling case so small that I can't even fit in my PSP slim by itself. It has room for about 4 UMDs, but I don't know how that would fit without squishing the hell out of my PSP slim.-Headphones are mono, not stereo. That's right, ""mono."" When I tested it I was looking for which one is the right and which one is the left headphone, but I found no marking.-I haven't tested the DC car charger yet, but it says that the PSP has to be off before plugging or unplugging the charger or damage could be caused to the PSP. I'm not sure if this is the case for all PSP DC car chargers, but I find this annoying.The Good:The 6 UMD clear cases. That's it.Conclusion:DON'T BUY!!! I wasted $25 on this piece of crap of a kit and I don't want any of you to waste your money like I did."
5,FANTASTIC BOOK!,"I started reading this book and just loved it. You go through dark, winding, and lots of tunnels that are easy to get lost in. A beautiful stallion romes the land of this underground island that seems as though it's just a rock. It's a fantastic book to read."
3,Medicore.,"Medicore at best, this book is unfortunately not very memorable. Returning to Azul Island and the island stallion, Farley threatens Flame with domesication. The ending is pretty guessable. If you really like the series, you might enjoy this book but only if you're a devoted fan."
1,Faulty mechanism,"What can I say? I press the buttons, the lens pops out but the light doesn't come on unless I jiggle the lens. Not how it's supposed to be.This magnifier is made in China, cheaply, and there's apparently no quality assurance for $10 items. You might get a good one. I just didn't - and I'm not going to start a return procedure for $10.A better choice would beCarson MiniBrite Pocket Magnifier."
5,Replacement for one I owned over 15 years . . .,The one I owned finally wore out after fifteen years of use. Glad to find that B&L still make it. Plan on using the new one for fifteen years more plus.
4,Clear and informative,"Although this book could use a little flashier presentation, it does a fine job with describing the physical changes of growing up. The line-drawings of people at different stages are detailed and commendable."
1,How to make the Author a 7 figure income....,More theory than action. No real benefit to my junior agents or experienced agents.
4,HOW TO DEVELOP A SIX FIGURE INCOME IN REAL ESTATE,I FIRST READ THIS BOOK 20 YEARS AGO AS A NEW REAL ESTATE AGENT. THE HOW TO INFORMATION AND METHODS ARE WELL PRESENTED AND CONTINUE TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE.
2,No surprises in this one.,"Basically, work smart not hard. I think we all know this already. I don't find any surprises in this book."
3,Excellent solid information,"A great book for giving you good solid advice on improving your sales tactics to become successful. Explains steps from setting up a farm to how to deal with clients through Q&A's. Good for newer agents or for a ""kick in the butt"" for people in the industry that need ""regeneration"". Suited for anyone who truly intends to become very successful in the real estate industry"
1,friction only,"the author wrote a novel and lot of his sales technique are 40 50 yrs old and it will never work. Buy pumpkins for neighborhood during thanksgiving, knock door to door etc won't work."
4,Good Book!,"It is not this book's fault if you didn't make it in Real Estate. Who said being a Real Estate agent is a walk in the park? Being a successful Real Estate agent means a lot of discipline and hard work. And to the last reviewer, blame your failures upon your self and not on this book."
5,You CAN be a great mom!,This book is so motivating and encouraging. I am thrilled that I bought this book. You will not regret this purchase. Learn foundations of being a great mom and how to open up the lines of communication with your children. See what a difference treating your children like people instead of pests can make. I have read this book so many times; it is chock full of good things. The author is never condescending or conceited. Her gentleness really flows through her writing. This is the kind of mom I wish I had and I wish I can be!
4,"book in good conditon, received in good time.","this book was ordered for my wife. Her evaluation: book in good condition, received in good time."
3,It's dry,I just could not get into this book.It was chosen as a book study at my church. The others enjoyed it more than I did.
5,Complete collection,Uncle MAP says these are the ones to get. Says there's episodes in here that he's never even seen. That's tough to do.
5,AWESOME,"This is by far the best collection available for 3 Stooges fans. It is non-stop back to back laughs. I love it. It is too bad that its not available in blu-ray though, because the quality sometimes leaves something to be desired."
3,bad discs,"The quality of the videos is good, if they play. Almost half of my discs don't work. They won't play and Ste acting like they're blank."
1,One-sided,"This is a failed ethnography. It is incredibly one sided. Sawyer claims to be the voice for the indigenous peoples, but she only studies OPIP, dismissing the DICIP. Her arguments are incredibly basic: oil companies are bad, OPIP is good. The book reads more like a travel book: Sawyer and her Journey to Ecuador."
1,Don't buy!!! Does not work. Customer service is bad and won't reply,This charger is terrible. When I bought this it was the iPad 4 one that was GUARANTEED TO WORK but mine didn't work. I emailed boxwave twice and they have not replied and its been four or five days. Don't buy unless you want to waste your money. It's a waste.
4,"Easy, Delicious Recipes","Have made 5 of the recipes so far, and every one has been a winner - easy to follow instructions, consistently delicious results. I highly recommend it for those how love to make delicious home-made chocolate goodies without taking 2 or 3 hours to do so. The only thing that would have made this better would be a spiral binding, as this regular soft-cover bound style doesn't want to stay open on it's own, resulting in more than a few brownie-batter fingerprints marring the pages of mine now. Oh, well. It's just got that ""lived in"" look."
2,No picture inside,"I feel dissapointed when i found there's no pictures inside the book, it almost same as copy-paste recipes from the internet. It is hard to imagine how the result look like. The reason i bought this book because Camilla V. Saulsbury's Piece of Cake book was so great and the pictures inside really helpfull."
3,Hidden Image: Photographs of the Male Nude in the 19th and 20th Centuries,I feel that this is not a great book but better then others out there it will be a good book for a coffee table
4,INFORMATIVE AND EASY READING,"I really thought this book was informative. I was not aware of all the ways terrorists can approach us, and what to do in those situations. It had many tips that would be useful in any emergency situation. I recommend it to anyone with a family."
5,Be informed and Protect yourself and FAMILY!!,"In common sense terms, this book informs you on what to do to stay informed, protect yourself, and provide the essential information to your loved ones on avoiding and surviving a terrorist attack in America. It is very easy to understand and I would recommend one for every household of all your relatives and friends. From reading this book I now know the essentials to continue living a comfortable American life and enjoying my freedom without worrying about myself or loved ones during this War on Terrorism!"
3,"Not bad, not great","This is a great shampoo, as shampoos go. I was not impressed with the color-depositing power of it. I think it would be better advertised as a color-protecting shampoo, because it didn't cause my color to fade quite so much, but it didn't ever give it more depth."
5,"Outstanding book, you MUST have it!!!!","This book is an eye opener and a marriage savior!Don't think before you buy because reason has nothing to do with the decision. Just buy it, read it and then, you will understand why.It's about respect and the differences between male and female. This book made me realize that the differences between man and woman is the very reason why mankind made it this far. So the differences have to be cherished and handled intelligently and not pushed back and hated. That's what this book explains in very clear way. The English is at times strange and difficult to understand but since the results were so outstanding I'd say it's probably part of the whole.Many thanks to the author, we owe you one!"
5,Secrets of Happily Married Men,"Husbands--finally a book that coaches you to use your inate skills and instincts to improve your relationship, rather than urge you to become more like women. Wives, I hope your husbands read this book!"
3,Books,The Books were given as a gift for a newly wed couple... so hopefully they read it and it was ok
2,"Have your wife read this, it would be an eye opener for her on how we think","Poor title, would help if my wife would read the first two chapters to get a very articulate treatise on how men think and how they may sometimes be misunderstood in their efforts to build stronger relationships.From the other reviews, I had hoped this would help me communicate better with my wife. Instead, I've read two chapters on how I'm perfectly fine and how the film and counseling industry is out to get ""men."" Sigh, I want my hours of reading back. On the plus side I got a happy smile from my wife when she saw I was reading this. I finally dropped this book as it spent so much time telling me what my strengths were and how I had all the skills I needed to make things better. Maybe i'm more in touch with how I feel than other guys? But I doubt it, I think most of us know how we feel and how we attack problems..."
2,"Not as good as Stosny, Real or Gottman","I was looking forward to reading this book given the reviews and synopsis, but was sorely disappointed, and even a bit downright annoyed at Haltzman's subtle sexism and simplistic explanations. Better bets would be the work of Steven Stosny (wowed by his ""I Can't Take It Anymore...""), Terrence Real (my hubby is impressed by his insight), and John Gottman (whose work in the love lab is remarkable)."
5,Awesome book,"This book is awesome everyone should read this book, easily to read and easily to understand how the opposite thinks and work"
2,Agree,"I agree with Johnny, Kira, and Sophie Lee. This is NOT what I think, anyone expected. The story of Sadako had to continue obviously, but there was no story here. That would be why the US remake almost never was. (They had to call in help from Japan to rewrite a new story!) At the turning point (i don't want to spoil anyone), the movie was over for me. I was asking why? Why taint Ringu? For the disappointed, take comfort in the fact that The Grudge 2 is even worse a sequel than this. Rent Rasen/Spiral instead, or the deeply sad Ringu prequel: 0 Birthday."
4,A Great CD,"Almost every track is good. What's great about this CD is that they're actual songs as opposed to the one minute loops that we got most of the time with previous WWF CDs.If you like metal/alternative, give this a try."
5,head-bangin joint,this album is tight...better cop itrollin is the best song on the cdbeautiful people by marilyn manson is great too
3,Bleh,I would have given this a 5. But they just HAAAD to put that CRAP band Boy Hits Car!! 12 years together and only 3 albums. If that were another band like... The Stones they would have 7 albums instead of 3!! That is sooo pathetic. I think they SHOULD break up!! They are getting NO WHERE fast! Plus some people kind of dislike Scott (the bassist) cause he was at Krock insteat of Comic-Con with the cast of Teen Titans. Some people were REALLY bummed!! I hope when he was performing at Krock I hope he felt REALLYYYYY REEEALLYY BAAADDD!!! For letting innocent kids DOWWWN!! They thought he WOULD be there.They waited ALLLL year for that and had there dreams CRUSHED into tiny pieces!! Because he had to go off and perform with his F-IN band!!!!!!! Scott if you read this I hope you feel REALLY BAD!!! Thanks for letting us down!!! You are way to OBSESSED with BHC!! GET THE #%^K OVER IT!! You aren't going ANYWHERE. I'm very sorry I just had to get that off my chest.
5,canadian version better,"excellent cd but one problem wwf made 2 edition ,1 with neurotica's new song (new band signed with smackdown record label)nothing to do with wwf entrance music and 2 one with finger eleven's kane entrance song slow chemical.being a wwfanatic i would buy the canadian cd and also buy neurotica's new album."
4,A Force to be reckoned with,"This CD is simply incredible. I really hope that the WWF uses some of these songs on their actual broadcasts (like the theme to Raw). Overall, this is a well put together CD with artists of varying styles. You should consider buying this if you like WWF television and like Rock music because this CD is definately not for the weak of heart. The only thing odd about the CD is the placement of the Creed and Neurotica songs simply because they don't relate to the WWF in any way. But otherwise this is a great CD to own."
3,Not what I expected,"Most of the tracks from this album arent the same as the wrestlers use, their either remixed, or drawn out longer. Edges theme and the Smackdown theme, beautiful people, are remixed quite badly, but the new Raw theme, RVD's theme and a great song by Our Lady Peace more then make up for it."
3,Good but bad.,Here is the songs and my reviews of them:1-Cool song. Drowning Pool really knows how to make music. 5/5.2. Bad- 1/5.3. Bad. 1/5.4. Love it. 5/5.5. Bad. 5/5.6. Cool. 5/5.7. Great. Rob Zombie really knows how to make music. 5/5.8. Great. 5/5.9. I just love this song. Marilyn Manson is good too. 5/5.10. I absolutley love this song. 5/5.11. Cool. 5/5.12. Cool. 5/5.13. Bad. 1/5.14. Cool. 5/5.15. Bad. 1/5.16. It's okay. 5/5.17. It's okay. 5/5.18. Bad. 5/5.
3,"Bad except for Creed, Disturbed and Our Lady Peace","This CD is full of dark music that only metal heads will like. There are a few songs on here for the hard rock lover such as I. The creed song 'young grow old' ...sounds like something off of My Own Prision(one of the greatest rock albums of all time). The disturbed song is good and hard and I like to work out with it. Limp and Kid honestly dont do it for me in this one. Legs [is no good]...stay the ZZTOP and Limp needs to quit pushing remixes of old songs such as Rollin and that [bad] new CD....But I guess this is good a metal fans...people who like manson, dope, and stuff that is anti-social(not there is anything wrong with that). Good for a Work-Out soundtrack. ROCK ON!"
4,Good things and bad,"I thought the new Creed song'Young Grow Old is much better than a previous reviewer stated it was full of passion and good sound so it got an A. But I also hated the Limp Bizkit mix of rollin. The Kid Rock version of 'Legs' was ok but ZZTOP's is still head and shoulders above the rest. Get this for Creed, Disturbed, and Our Lady Peace. If you like that stuff."
4,pretty good cd,"it's a good cd for the wrestling fans out there. my favorites are stone cold, youth grow old, raw theme, edge and others."
1,Never received cd,I wish I could review this cd. I ordered it in May. I have yet to receive the cd. I am very disappointed with the seller boardman.
2,Nothing new,"With the WWF aligning with MTV, this had put them into further more mainstream exposure with well known bands allowing the WWF to use them to promote their product. Welcome to Rock n' Wrestling II. There are few great songs on this cd like Disturbed, What?!?, I said Disburbed, Our Lady Peace, and Breaking Point, with Marilyn Manson remix of ""Beautiful People"", Finger Eleven, and Saliva in the average department.I must say the most DISAPPOINTING track of this cd is Drowning Pool's version of ""The Game"" which is the theme for one of the worst wrestlers in the WWF named Triple H (he has nothing to deliver except punches, knees, and kicks which quite frankly put me to sleep). The song started awesome with great beats, and went downhill from there. The original version by Motorhead is terrific and intense but this remix is just plain GARBAGE and very annoying."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this CD expecting to hear the current entrance themes, but all I hear are remixed versions. I know that the Rob Zombie song, Limp Bizkit song, and Marilyn Manson song specify that it's a remix, but none of the other songs do. The only theme that has actually been played on a WWF program is Disturbed's ""Breaking Glass"". On the Limp Bizkit song, I expected to hear the sound of someone walking and hearing the Undertaker say ""Dead Man Walking"" and then go into ""Rollin'"", but all I hear is a motorcycle sound. The only reason I didn't give this album 1 star is because there are some songs on this album that I do like. I like Drowning Pool's version of ""The Game"", the Disturbed song, and the Creed song. That's pretty much it. In my opinion, not worth the money."
4,WOW,this cd is fantastic. if you are a wwf fan or just a rock fan pick this cd up you will not regreat it
5,Great CD Even If You Hate Wrestling!!!!!,Great CD even if you hate wrestling. All the remixes are great and new songs are even better! I especially love Whatever by Our Lady Peace and and Glass Shatters by The Disturbed. This album is definitly worth a buy.1.The Game - Drowning Pool A+2.Legs - Kid Rock C+3.Young Grow Old - Creed B+4.Glass Shatters - The Disturbed A+5.Rollin - Limp Bizkit A6.Whatever - Our Lady Peace A+7.Never Gonna Stop - Rob Zombie B8.One Of A Kind - Breaking Point B9.The Beautiful People - Marilyn Manson A-10.Across The Nation - Union Underground A11.Break The Walls Down A-12.Turn The Tables - Saliva B13.Live For The Moment - Monster Magnet B+14.The End Of Everything - Stereomud A-15.Ride Of Your Life - Neurotica B+16.Just Another Victim - Cypress Hill A+17.No Chance - Dope A18.Lovefurypassionenergy - Boy Hits Car A-So overall I'd give this album an A.
4,One of the best WWF(E) compilations!,"This a great cd, especially if you like listening to the music you hear on WWE. As far as I know, this is the only CD I've seen that has the theme songs for RAW and SMACKDOWN on any compilation so this is a great treat. Some songs however leave you wondering, what the heck are they on this cd for? For example, Creed's song. Has this ever been on a WWE event? Not to my knowledge. And to clear things up, the Neurotica song ""Ride of Your Life"", IS actually related to WWE. It was the theme for 2002's King of the Ring match (just found that out). So, in other words GET THIS CD NOW!!!"
5,The Mariner as the spitting image of doubt,"I've just stumbled into ""The Rhyme"" by hearing an Heavy Metal song (Iron Maiden's Rhyme Of The Ancient Mariner), it's not much of an approach to British Classical Poetry but it was a beginning.I'd really liked the strieving of the poor man that lived on a tragedy like the death of his mates, and all for his own fault. The obvious drift to everyday life's doubt is clear, I still have to understand the bird's meaning..I didn't liked the Italian translation so I've re-written it in Italian, with a lot of effort, it's strange how it resembles Dante's Divina Comedia, it has all the same features, God, The Evil, Death, Blood, Sweat and Tears.At the end of the day a pleasant companion for your sleepless night, Thank you Sam !"
5,Classic,This is a poem by Samuel T. Coleridge. It is one of the classics out there that is public-domain. I will admit this poem is a little weird and hard to understand but read it slowly and the meaning if clear. This is offered free in the Kindle store or at several other different public-domain free sites.
3,Very lovely book.,"This book is a great addition to anyone's collection of ornamental coffee table books. Huzzah to Paul Fry for this stunning critico-philosophical achievement! He has completely outdone himself! His reputation as a great Yale school critic is sealed with the completion of this marvellous tome, perfect for that special gift.Coming next: Paul Fry will edit a fancy children's edition of Kipling."
1,Sorry - The other reviews listed are from another edition.,"I was suprised when I received The Modern Critical Interpretations edition of the Rime of the Ancient Mariner.There are no woodcuts or any other pictures, there are no silver pages, there is no poem at all!This book is only modern critical interpretations - nothing more. Buy it if you are a scholar - and refer to a separate copy of the poem.I should have known from the edition but the editorial reviews were from a different book that was an edition of the actual poem."
5,Thoughtful entertainment,"This has been a favorite story for over twenty years. I love to read and re-read it occasionally. I manage to find some new adventure or feeling to consider nearly every time I open it. What a wonderful reminder, that we are the caretakers of our wild world and the ability to preserve or destroy it rests largely, if not solely with the human race. Don't misunderstand, it's more of an adventure than anything else, but the undertones of environmental responsibility are subtly there occasionally as well."
3,No-frills poem,"Format is basic, but adequate. If all you want is the poem, it works. But you will have to find another source if you want explanations and interpretations."
3,Just the poem.,This is just the poem and nothing else. Probably not my favorite but there are 3 stanzas I do love and the price is right.
5,Classic,Once a classic always a classic.It is not a question of rating a work by S T Coleridge. He was great in so many ways.
3,water water every where,"The poem remains powerful and haunting. The layout on my Kindle makes it hard to read. figures are missing, editorial footnotes are in midst of content. After struggling with the Kindle version I gave up and bought a used hard copy. I do NOT recommend this book or Canterbury tales in the Kindle versions."
4,Stan and Ollie hide a kidnapped goat from their landlord,"Stan and Ollie have an escaped goat follow them home. Afraid that they will be charged with goat napping, they try to hide it from their grumpy landlord under their bed. Noticing the goat has a bit of a ""tang"", they try bathing it. A massive water fight and hilarious mayhem ensues. One of their funnier silent films."
4,Good collection,"Something on your mind was a Smooth cut that captured D-Train's sound and overall vibe. D's theme was a tight cut as well.Just another night was a jam as well,but the Bigggest Jam by them was the Funky and still Banging Bam Board groove Your'e the One for Me"". matter of fact I dug my tape out the other day and just fired up that cut. those Boards are still slamming to my ears after all of these years. when Bro Man sings you just don't know what your love does to me and he sings I'm not the same, that whole exchange is a groove that just won't let up."
2,What a disappointment....,"Evidently, Mr. Morris from Toronto, Canada, and I are the only ones to get the bad DVDs in this forum. Moreover, the only female voice to even SOUND decent was Mignon Dunn's, most probably because she's a mezzo and the engineering is less difficult than with high (and often, bigger, voices). The best of part of the DVD was watching and hearing the hysterical audience. Since I can only hear/see opera canned, it's no wonder I to often have a warped idea of who sounds like what. So I have never gotten the benefit of adoring certain singers, if you see what I mean."
1,Genius Betrayed,A brilliant production of a work of genius rendered hopelessly and utterly useless by unbelievably inept engineering. Imagine having to strain to hear Birgit Nilsson's expression of towering rage and despair in her powerful 'Agamemnon' monologue? (BIRGIT NILSSON of all people!!!) Barely audible enough to hint at what must have been a truly awedome and spine-tingling performance in the flesh. Left me hanging for more and very dissatisfied indeed.
3,Technically very poor,"The opera itself is fantastic, compelling in a similar way to Strauss' (also one act) 'Salome'. The set of this production I also greatly admired; obviously in starkness and colouring it was meant to recall certain late 20th century Wagner Ring productions. However, as another reviewer notes, the singing is often almost entirely drowned out by the orchestra because of technical incompetence in making the dvd. Also, the picture quality is very blurry."
1,opera looking for singers,"I was just watching this and I had to turn it off. These ladies, as great as they were in their day, were no longer able to deliver the qualities that this opera deserves.Listen to the Solti version and spare yourself this agony."
3,FLAWED DVD!,"There's just something about this DVD - the technical aspect that is quite, quite dreadful. It is of course a Video to DVD transfer and that's where the flaws lie .... the voices are occasionally {and more than occasionally} drowned out by the orchestra.Performances? Superior ... except for the unflattering camerawork and the lost opportunities.The climatic conclusion between Elektra and Clytemnestra is utterly wasted - the moment when Clytemnestra reveals her true self - and drops the ornate 'walking' canes and exits screeching with laughter at her misbegotten daughter ! Missed!!! {A Crucial moment of the work, superbly realized in the 1975 Karl Bohm Paris production ['THAT' decaying anthill set!]Such a superior moment - also the recognition scene between Orestes and Elektra - another wasted opportunity .Camera lacks the tension of the drama.Sets and costumes are effectively lit and executed."
4,GREAT THEATRE,"Both Nilsson and Rysanek (sick and with high fever) are not in their prime, but WHAT a great piece of THEATRE! Nilsson's involvment in this role is overwhelming too such a degree that you can ignore that her voice sounds a bit worn. The public roars - and rightly so. If you want to experience Nilsson as one of the truly great actors of the operatic scene, buy this DVD at once. I was deeply moved and cried at the end."
2,not again,I got this gor my 9 year old Grand-daughter who has othere ones also and she did not like it very much. Said it was boring and ugh.
4,Solid Goosebumps,"This is a solid Goosebumps movie from the series. If you read the book, it follows the story line somewhat, but does deviate a bit. The characters are the same but no doubt you'll notice scene omissions especially with the ""shadow"" that follows Hannah around. As the movie progresses it moves further away from the book, but still clings on to the main idea. It's not ""scary"", but it's not a cartoon either. Pretty well done"
4,good movie,bought this for grandson. fairly good movie with a few good twists to it. a good buy for goosebumps lovers.
5,Incredible product,This large loaf is filled with bananas. It is tender and flavorful. It tastes like you alway imagined banana bread should. (Try making french toast with it! Yumm :P)
3,Guitar good accessories poor,"The guitar and amp are pretty good considering its a starter guitar. A few of the accessories, such as the tuner, simply didn't even work. So I would have rated the guitar and amp alone much higher if you are expecting a starter guitar."
4,Good Guitar,"The guitar sound quality is good, but sounds like an acoustic guitar until you turn on o.d. on the amp. The strings kind of break easily, but they feel good. It didn't come with the case, so that was pretty disappointing. The tuner wasn't the way it looks in the picture. Its the kind where you clip it on the strings and it tells you if it is good or not. It malfunctions a lot, so its not much of use. In conclusion, the guitar is good."
5,WORTH IT!!!,"You have to buy this guitar!!! It's amazing for the price, it's a great deal, and everything in the set is great for beginners"
3,Could be better.,"My Guitar was too be here March 28th.It did not ship till the 27th so therefore I did not get it till the 2nd of April.That's Alright I understand that you fall behind.The thing That makes me upset it When I got my Guitar I tried to plug it up to the amp and little to not sound is what I got.So then I tried it on my Rock Smith game and the game did not pick it up.Plugged up my other Guitar to both and every thing worked. So then I sent an E-mail to Go-DPS and got this massage back from them, ""Hey Jamie,I'm going to check into what we can do for you and get back with you on monday.Thank you so much!TomiCustomer Service RepGO-DPS.com""I got this massage on Good Friday (The day after my E-mail) It's now Wen. and still nothing from them. So If I was in the market for a new Guitar I'd look around for something a little better I think."
4,Long road but a good one,Decent guitar for the price. Beginners guitar at best. If your looking for a true strat this isnt it if your looking for something the kids can get practice and look cool doing it well good price for what you get
5,The absolute best.,"This items comes with everything you need to start playing the guitar. In other store this guitar is over $200 just for the guitar alone. With this you get the amp, guitar, case, guitar picks need I say more. My daughter loved it for her birthday. I will have to buy another one by Christmas for my son."
2,SMOKE from AMP,"the package arrived in good shape and nothing out of place or missing which was goodthe bad thing was that the amp was completely futile! the minute I hooked up the guitar to the amp and started playing, there was a weird 'pop' and crackling noises and some smoke or dust coming from the amp. I shrugged it off, thinking it was dust from the long long long journey from the states to asia. the amp started to sound static-y and saw MORE smoke so I freaked and turned it off. I tried turning it back on a few minutes later and no luck, it fried and gave out on me in less than 5 minutes. i guess i should have expected some defects considering the price of it all. even the ""made in china"" tag was typed out as ""china in made"""
1,Want to discourage a new guitar player....buy this guitar!,"Since day one...this guitar will not stay in tune. We sent it out for a professional set up...which you shouldn't have to do on a beginner guitar, and was told there is no hope for this thing. The frets are sharp, and will slice your fingers. Shame on Fender. I can tell you the next level guitar will not be a Fender-they have no pride in what they sell under their name brand. There are other companies that make a far better starter guitar kit....stay away from this one."
1,dont waste your time with this guitar,ok if you honestly thought you would be able to buy a real fender strat for $200 bucks the you were completely wrong..This guitar is a Squire which is like a cheap brand that Fender own. You can pick up a squire at wallmart or target. A real American made Fender Stratocaster will cost you over a thousand dollars and you will have trouble finding them in most guitar stores. please dont even bother with this thing it is a worthless piece of junk. save up some money if your a beginner buy a samick guitar which is around the same price but is much better. Samick sells guitar parts to companys like gibson and fender and they are great if your a beginner. Anyway the point is this guiat sucks dont get it!
5,best book EVER!!,"This is the ultimate surf book. I live on LBI and both of my parents grew up here. I am a surfer, and have just finished reading this amazing tale by Bruce Novotny. This is the greatest book I have ever read. I could not put it down. I could relate to the characters, as well as the places, since I know all the settings they talk about in the book. It is a great tale of summer, the ones we all look forward to. THe book just adds to the greatness of surfing. Everyone who surfs, or lives near the beach, should read this book."

1,Stale as can be!,Why in gods name are they selling stale food from this place. The expiration date is for dec 09 but yet there stale. The people that make these maybe changed the dates so they could sell them? The other reviewer also mentioned they came stale. I am upset i paid $18 for a bunch of stale food i had to toss. Thanks amazon...
4,So far so good,Milk thistle is supposed to benefit the liver. Will update everyone in 30 years to let you know how it worked out.
5,works great,cant say much. milk thistle works great to lower your enzymes. just one dose and you notice the difference the next day.
4,"I' ve printed Retail Grade DVD covers, but burned out head","I bought this printer new last October I was really astounded at the Retail grade DVD covers it produced, I printed about 1,800 covers before a Canon tech told me (by special free toll free number) the printing head was burnt out, but that they would send me a new one to replace old one since I had signed up when I first bought the printer. I am disabled and Canon took my word and is sending the part rather than me having a difficult time of getting someone to to take it to a authorized repair shop. Nice to know that a company as big as Canon stillbelieves a customers disabled and acts accordingly. I would buy another printer/scanner again because they know and believe that I am disabled and need special help. I would have given it 5 stars but this printer eats a lot of ink with very small ink holding cartridges of 9 ml(B) 1.5ml(color), with 30 ml to equal 1 *ounce*."
1,Won't Work,"I couldn't get this to work with my Windows ME. Canon tech support was polite but very ineffectual. They tried to blame the problem on everything but their own product. You also have to call Canon on your own dime. All I got from buying this product was a long distance phone bill, the run around, and a headache."
5,Rich and creamy dark chocolate with fresh raisins... delicious!,"This fudge is rich, decadent and perfect for any dark chocolate lover. The fresh raisins mixed with the dark chocolate make an excellent sweet treat. Order yours today!"
2,Slipper Shoes:,"Great slipper--could NOT find the size chart anywhere, when trying to place the order. What does Medium mean for a men's shoe? I thought that my 12 yr. old son would surely be able to wear them. I was wrong on Christmas--Medium meant too small. Irritating."
4,Drawer Liner,"Excellent as drawer liner; however, this product is thinner than the one available in the larger roll."
2,Grips to everything,"Moved and wanted to line my shelves, so i bought 4 large rolls of this liner. I am very disappointed--first, it is difficult to cut as it must be irregulars--none of the lines were straight--all on angles making it impossible to cut. Secondly, it grips to everything-everytime i take a dish out, i have to fight with this stuff--i would not purchase again. I am writing to the company and sending a sample--save yourself money-wash out the shelves, and do not use anything!"
1,It's a gamble if you buy it,"I am one of those ""write the review only if it's bad"" people, so here's the deal: I purchased 36 of the Toro Universal Impact Sprinkler-40 units as part of a large irrigation project this June. After lots of planning, trenching, and backaches I fired the system up to awe at the beauty of hassle-free watering. To my surprise and chagrin, I have not been able to enjoy the fruits of my labor, as every day I have had to fiddle with a head or two. One will get stuck on return, while another (a 360 degree uninterrupted cycle) will inexplicably stick. All told I will be replacing 5 of the 36 Toro heads I installed (probably with Rainbirds or Orbits) in an effort to achieve my goal. The bottom line is that a 15% failure rate is totally unacceptable and I DO NOT recommend using the Toro heads for anyone wanting a truly enjoyable sprinkler system experience."
1,Don't install these,I have the same problem as the other reviewer. I have a small yard with 9 of these installed and I end up replacing at least two each season. They eventually end up sticking to one side and no amount of flushing or cleaning will make them work. I'm tired of digging them up each season so as each one fails again I will replace them with another brand.
1,50%failure rate over 1 year,I have had to replace half of my sprinklers over the first year. I have used the Toro gear driven sprinklers with good results but their impact sprinklers are horrible.
1,Same problem - they stick,"I have the same problem as the other reviewers. The sprinkler head sticks, usually on return. I've fiddled with the thing to no end. The problem seems to be just too much friction in the rotating connection. I would not recommend this product."
2,Hard to study for someone just starting Bible study,"I have a hard copy of "" NIV study Bible Published by Zondervan "", I Thought your study Bible would be the same. so I could carrry it on my Kindle ( IT would be lighter ) and study whan I travel. The hard copy I have, is published by a ""CO-PUBLISHER BY"" On the cover Zondervan is printed. Inside in small print I found TYNDALE AND ZONDERVAN PUBLISHING HOUSE. This Bible has ""VITAL STATISTICS"" at the begining of the book, The Bible Books as writen in the Bible next, Then comments by the Bible expert at the bottom of each page. That comment there makes it easy to understand."
5,What more can you say...,"It's the Bible... enough said. Why write a review? Either you want the ""word"" or you don't. Plain & simple"
4,Expands ones bible knowledge in several ways,Thorough notes and general info to enrich any bible reading or yearly study. Answers so many of the questions that come to mind when reading God's word. Helps understand the Word by explaining the time and the place when God inspired the people who recorded his message. A must for anyone but especially someone reading through the Bible in a year.
4,Very accessible and useful,I have found this version of the Bible very accessible for kindle. The ability to highlight and bookmark is especially useful to keeping track of my spiritual reflections and moving from current text to referenced texts.
3,NIV Study Bible,This Bible is easy to read but can be frustrating to use because one must be careful where they turn the pages. I found it difficult to navicate at times.
5,NIV Study Bible,The Niv arrived in a timely manner. I would not hesitate to buy from this seller in the future. The e-book has been very helpful in my studies
4,Kindle 3G keyboard - 4.5,"As I am learning more about my Kindle, I am enjoying it much more. My only suggestion would be a hard copy of instructions instead instructions being on the Kindle."
4,Zondervan NIV Study Bible,I have this Bible in written version and wanted it on the kindle for easy access. I like it on the kindle BUT the footnotes are noteasily accessible and I do not like that.
5,NIV Study Bible,This is the best study Bible I have seen for Kindle. I have been reading all the way thru this year and Kindle is a great way to do it.
3,reading under kindle is not very useful for study,looking up bible references in the kindle environment is not friendly. I don't read novels but I do do research and need search capabilities.
3,Haven't yet figured out how to find the Notes like those that appear at the bottom of each page on my hard copy study bible,"navigation is more difficult than what I expected, but i especially miss not being able to glance down at the bottom of the page and see notes that correspond to the text"
1,New 'gender neutral' translation banned by several denominations,"Just a heads up, this 'gender neutral' translation has been censured by the Southern Baptist Convention and several other denominations. It is quite different than the earlier, ""true"" NIV published by Zondervan originally in 1984. Let the buyer beware! If you think you are getting the original NIV you are in for a BIG surprise!! Zondervan is doing the public a huge disservice by not making this completely clear. If you are looking for the REAL NIV bible, make sure you buy one of the 1984 versions and not this 2011 translation."
2,Trading a backache for a headache,"I bought the kindle edition hoping to lighten the load in my backpack. For sure the print edition is a hulking load. But navigating the kindle edition is a big headache. I never know where I am in the text. Jump to a text note, then try to get back. Sure you can click to go back, but the pagination will be different when you go back. Try to jump to a new spot in the bible using the grab bar at the bottom? Good luck! Your chances of landing on a page of text notes or cross references are higher than landing on the text itself. Location 3256 out of 178,008 is meaningless. You have no idea where you are in the book unless you navigate by way of the table of contents. There are no page headings to let you know what book chapter and verse you are looking at. Sometimes you have to scroll back a page or two to find the next chapter heading. It will lighten your load, but your head will spin trying to use it."
4,NIV Bible,"I've always enjoyed this copy of Gods word. I have the hard copy of this, the study Bible is always good to have."
4,Zondervan NIV Bible,"I was a little disappointed that they had changed ""sinful nature"" to ""flesh"" in Romans chapter eight. Otherwise, I have enjoyed it."
1,niv study bible sample,"The sample doesn't even allow one to see if one can navigate the content. The entire sample is pages and pages of ""how to..."", indexes, dictionary of terms etc etc. I did get to maps which are hard to see on this kindle."
1,No good,It's very difficult to use this Bible. It has no navigation tools whatsoever. You have to keep going back to the table of content every time.
2,Left-hand letters chopped off,"I found several sections that had the first letter on the left-hand margin chopped off. The sections were ""Index to Color Maps"", ""Index to Notes"", ""Ancient Text Relating to the Old Testament"". I feel that these were essential parts of a study Bible. Changing margins and fonts did not change the problem. Other than that one issue I was pleased with the product. I returned for refund. I did not see where I could ask for a replacement which I would prefer."
1,one star,I expected in the books of the Bible individual verses to be easier to find. It is very difficult to find scriptures.
4,Highlighting is difficult,When I highlight things it doesn't seem to work write for me. I think I need more time before I can rate it higher.
4,Handy to have with me,"The digital version is nice to have with me while I'm ""on the go"". I have noticed some incorrectly formatted pages at the end of Leviticus, making it difficult to read. (seems like two columns on one page and the words run together). This only occurs for a couple of pages and then it is better again."
5,NIV Study Bible,"This is a really nice - no, ""Excellent"" study Bible with all kinds of references, maps and illustrations. We got this for a female member of our Bible Study who is ill with cancer and asked specifically for ""a pink Bible that explained things."" This is especially good for anyone who is not all that familiar with the geography and cultures associated with the different ages found in the Bible. I used to have to draw out primitive maps to for folks to show where locations were, and hand drawn illustrations to give an idea of what were talking about. (My rendering of the Ark of the Covenant left a lot to be desired).This a quality publication bound in an excellent covering."
3,Not very user friendly on Kindle.,"I have the Kindle version and using the study notes it time consuming. Unlike the book version where you find the notes at the bottom of each page, using the kindle notes, you have to follow a link to another page then toggle back to where you were."
4,I enjoy to book.,"I use it often. Easy to leaf through. Easy to find Books, chapters, and verses. I wish it had topic searches."
2,Not as expected,I have an NIV Bible on my phone which is fairly easy to use. I thought that the NIV Study Bible for Kindle would be the same. That is not the case. It was almost impossible to navigate. I was very disappointed so I returned it.
2,THICK and Small Print!,"I had to return this purchase as it turned out to be much more ""compact"" than I anticipated. It is extraordinarily thick and the print is quite small. Fine if you have young eyes, but is just not a comfortable read (or carry). Going to look for a less compact option."
3,Limited exposure to kindle version,So far I find it readable and crisp on new iPad kindle app. Except for maps and images. Very low res imaging makes it difficult to see any detail. Woul like to see hi res images throughout. Would also like red letter for the price. Not real happy with the system they used for references. All are at end of each book which means to skip over them you must flip a lot of pages or nav back to contents then nav to next book. Generally disappointing tech features (or lack thereof).Too limited in functionality for 2012.
2,Not comparing translations but the notes,"Ever since the success and acclaim of the ESV Study Bible, it seems that nearly every translation is rushing to get their Study Bible out the door. Many products feel rush and incomplete.Although this particular NIV2011 Study Bible wasn't necessarily rushed, it doesn't have the amazing depth and coverage of the aforementioned ESVSB. That might be an unfair comparison (although I don't know why when you have Douglas Moo as the General Editor of the NIV2011 translation), but the ESVSB is now the mark of what we should expect from from all study bibles. If you are not going to be at that level, why even bother?For those who love the NIV, I would not recommend this SB at all. I think you would be better served using notes from a better SB or light commentaries."
5,Worth its weight,"I bought this version of the Bible because it is the version all of the others in my Bible study group were using. It had become very confusing as we each read chapters aloud to the group. I had been using the MacArthur NKJV but I elected to go with the NIV so we would all be on the same page (no pun intended). The study notes are very concise and helpful, the maps and diagrams are well presented, and I appreciate the more readily understandable contemporary English translation. It is now my own preferred reference.On the down side: it weighs nearly 4 1/4 pounds and is about 2 inches thick, making it a bit of an inconvenience to lug to class."
2,Very Difficult to use.,This book is too difficult to use. it's very hard to find what I am looking for in this bible.
5,Best Bible for Kindle,"Unlike the Holman translation I also have, the NIV has study notes, cross references, and pictures to amplify the passages I'm reading. The references are easy to navigate through and returning is made easy with the back button when you go too far away. The NIV is one of my favorite translations, but this Bible is most similar to my actual, non-Kindle one that any I've found."
4,first class exposition of The Book,"Very rich product, loaded with crossd-references, etc. Navigation is sometimes a little difficult, but then I'm new to the Kindle."
5,First book on my kindle.,I think that everyone should have a study Bible on their kindle.This is the best book to spend your money on.
2,Difficult to get to notes,"I enjoy the material that is in this, but find it hard to get to the notes. Some of the notes are very easy to get to but others are quite difficult."
2,Not user friendly,It is NIV which I like but either I have not mastered the processes or it is not user friendly. Tough to move around and find things.
3,This Bible is nice....but,"Sorting to find a particular verse, book or even some references is not easy. Granted it is an online version of a regular bible, I would think it could be developed to have a search mechanism which will allow phrases, words or topics to find specifics in this bible. RJW"
1,unhappy,Unfortunately this book could not be opened on my E Reader so I cannot make any review comments on it . This was the NIV BibleMaxine
2,NIV review,I am very disappointed as to how difficult it is to maneuver through this Bible and get where I want to be. I used one on my son's NOOK and it was so much easier and enjoyable. This one is a chore to work with.Joyce Newsome
3,Layout not reader friendly,Not to happy with it once I recieved it. The pictures are nice but I did not like the way things are placed throughout the Bible.
5,Study Bible,This is a wonderful Study Bible! The NIV version is easy to read and having a Study Bible is a great way to get to a deeper understanding of God's word!
1,Poorly set up.,Locating scriptures is very difficult. Going back and forth to the index to locate a reading is frustrating.I love the Bible but I do not like to use this edition. There are far better editions on-line.Had I known how it was set up I would never bought it. Never.
2,Decent but certain things suck,"pros: very durable son liked it since it was introduced early on and he didn't have many other options. :-)cons: phone cord way too short. dial pad is covered (not sure why) and the beads on top can't move cuz the stem is way too short and close together. opening the cube via the clock: no young child is going to get this. Especially for the age they recommend. You end up having to do it for them.Probably better options out there. My sister gave me a battat one that has no music or lights but has keys and shapes, going to give that one a try next."
2,Durable - but that's where the positive feedback ends!,"My 18-month-old daughter chucked this cube across the room (out of frustration with its many challenging and annoying functions), and it didn't break...that's all the good I have to say about it. Like the others, my husband (who is a born engineer who has missed his calling) was the only one able to figure out how to open the clock door, we think the phone cord is WAY too short, the letters/numbers are too difficult for a 30-year-old mom to push through their respective slots, and overall the toy is colorful but very BLAH. We also would have spent more on an expensive activity cube that will last as well as entertain. This toy sits in the corner and is rarely used by my daughter or any of her playdates. UPDATE: this like-new toy finally made it into the fall garage sale. It sold right away, as it looked like new and I was charging $1. I wanted it OUT of my house!!"
2,It looks great....,"My one year old liked this toy in the shopping cart, but once we got home it has not been played with alot. The beads are not much fun because they don't move easily and the numbers and letters are hard to push in. I should have spent the money on the big cube toy instead."
2,Watch the paint!,"I got this as a hand-me-down toy and my daughter loved it from about 6 months old to 9 months old. Yesterday I threw away all of the number and letter shapes because the paint was scratched off under her fingernails and yes, on her lips! I washed her off as best I could and I just pray that this was not one of the toys from China made with lead paint!"
1,Don't waste your money,"My brother bought this for my kids last Christmas. I agree with everything everyone else has said about it. It came with no directions. Someone finally figured out how to open the door to the clock. My kids ripped the door off and it disappeared. The beads are too big for the maze. The shapes only fit into the sorter if you have a mechanical engineering degree. The twirly thing doesn't do anything. And, we can't figure out how to make the music start. Sometimes the thing makes music, and sometimes it doesn't. I put it away for a year and just brought it out for the kids to play with. They were so excited one hour ago and now are already frustrated with it and are throwing it off of things. Also, I opened the door to replace the batteries for the very first time, and now the screw won't hold the door shut and I had to tape it shut. My brother had a baby this year - I'm thinking of giving the box to him as payback for the frustration."
2,"Not terrible, just okay","I liked the number of features incorporated into one toy, but now I regret the purchase. It's a space hog, and the kids play with it enough that they would notice and be disappointed if it just disappeared. The paint is chipping off the letters, and they aren't a great fit into the holes anyway. The parts where the bead-like things slide on the tubes (sorry, I can't describe it well!) are too close to one another for my son to manuveur them easily. The phone cord is too short to really use it as a phone. (A friend who has an older version of this toy said that there is no cord attaching their phone, so I'm thinking about just cutting it.) Parts get stuck all the time, which is usually when my kids get bored with it.We love other toys from Parents (whose name is on this) and it's a good magazine, but this one just doesn't measure up. I had much higher hopes after buying (and loving) their blocks and their music set."
5,hilarious!,Hilarious and rude humor but very entertaining to watch!!!!!!!! Not recommend for kids under 13. I really like robot chicken it's really fun to watch when your day was terrible and you need a good laugh!!
3,great package,"I was so impressed just by Darling's little pink-diary-with-a-lock-and-key packaging that, in itself, it may be enough to buy the book just to enhance the look of your bookshelf. Otherwise....Not much inside. Most memorable is a photocopy of a diary page of Darling describing what it's like to have once been known and then forgotten...or worse. The book has pages that make you regret you must hesitate for a moment before flipping to the next."
5,Excellent Mystery,"This book was a great surprise. The cover art, descriptions and title indicate it will be a dark, tough read - No. It was fascinating. I read it the same weekend I read Grisham's The Painted House and this book was far superior with far less (if any) publicity. It is an excellent story that moves right along and provides a totally unexpected ending. What a shame this paperback is out of print. No doubt because only 5 authors in America get any attention from the media. This author deserves better. Get it used if you possibly can. Very enjoyable."
1,Piece of junk,"Camera seemed to be ok on the outside, but when I went to put the batteries in a piece of the camera broke off."
4,Durable,"I use this for architecture models, not railroad modeling and it works just fine. The letters and numbers are printed on but they do not scratch off. It is well made and doesn't bend easily. My only problem so far is that the edges are slightly rounded, throwing off my measurements a bit."
1,Fix this ad.,"This advertisement does not list the scales on the rule, or allow a viewer to enlarge it to see the scales. Wake up Amazon."
4,Great Boots!,"They arrived within 5 days from my order in a secured box! Very comfortable, warm and roomy. Based on prior reviews, I went a 1/2 size larger as I usually wear an 8.5 and bought a 9. Even with my thickest of wool socks, I still have wiggle room and if I were to do it over again, I would have ordered my true size. I do question whether they will fit appropriately after they are more broken in. Traction is a little questionable as I did slide on the ice. Regardless, they are very comfortable, supportive, durable and kept my feet warm and dry in the snow. For ordering something on-line without the benefit of trying them on, these boots are a definite keeper!"
3,Boots,The boots are really cute. Comfort was okay for awhile. After wearing them for over (5) hours they started to hurt my feet. They were very warm.
5,My favorite cold weather boots,"I work outdoors in all types of weather, and finding comfortable, waterproof shoes is always a top priority for me. These boots meet my cold-weather needs. My feet were always cold in my other boots, but these are incredibly warm and comfortable.Because of the high wear my work shoes receive, I usually go through a pair of boots every three months and then it's time for them to be replaced. These boots have lasted 6 months so far, and their condition is not too bad at this point.I have re-waterproofed them twice so far, but that's typical for all my boots. I recommend the Sorel boots highly!"
5,Very well made winter boot for wife.,"These boots appear to be very well made and are comfortable. Unfortunately, by the time we bought them, the harsh February winter was pretty much over, so my wife never got a chance to really check them out. Oh well, there's always next year."
5,GREAT BOOTS,I bought these boots for my wife and she just loves them. The first pair I bought had to be returned (no problem) because there was something pushing against the top of her foot. The replacement pair is a great fit and no problems. Nice tread pattern to decrease falling.
4,chem book review,"this book came a little longer than i anticipated, 3 weeks from the date i ordered it, so if you want your book fast i recommend the expediated shipping. Also, there was a problem with the packing it stuck directly to my book removing pieces of the cover, which i think is not great for the buyback. Other than that it was the cheapest priced of all textbook websites."
2,Disappointed,"Buyer Beware! When you buy a used book, you run the risk of not getting what you paid for. I didn't realize until I got to pages 142-144, that it had been ripped out of the book. This was a very important page for the class. Definitely a learning experience!"
4,Fascinating and Uplifting,"While not the best written thing I've ever read, it is one of the most interesting and uplifting stories of personal triumph over evil that I've encountered. An excellent portrayal of man's inhumanity to man, on the one hand, and on how evil can be defeated on the other."
3,"Pleasant, but lacked the sensitivity McNaught is known for.","I have been an avid fan of Judith's from the very first words in ""Whitney My Love"" and through every historical romance she's written. I've read her contemporaries as well, but find them lack lustre. ""Remember When"" was no exception. I dearly wish she would return to Historicals and remain in the genre where she truely SHINES. I hope her editor reads this."
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.,"This novel was okay but it could have been better, because what it was missing was one excitement, there wasn't any time in the book that I read that they fought. I makes that novels better when something happens this novel is for peepz who are in for those love-bee bud-be stuff."
3,Not her best,"I have loved almost all of Judith McNaught's novels, but not this one. I couldn't figure out what it was that brought these two people together. It was still a good read, but it doesn't compare to Paradise."
3,I was very disappointed by this book...,"I generally only buy books in their paperback version, so I waited a really long time to read this one, since it took forever to switch over from hardback to paperback. I was really let down when I finished. This book definitely did not have the Judith McNaught charm of her other novels. There was too much individual focus, not enough relationship development. The story did not capture my imagination and my heart the way Ms. McNaught's other novels have. I'm not a huge fan of Tender Triumph or Double Standards, but I think that even they were better than this one! I'm not giving up on Ms. McNaught forever, I just hope her next venture is more in line with the wonderful work we know that she can do!"
3,Wrong Focus,"The character of Cole and Diana are the best i have read of all the Judith's book, yet the focus is on the wrong half and there is no hilight about their love, I hope there will be a next book, Remember When ( Continue), portray the same character yet put them in the limelight."
2,This simply is not Judith McNaught!!!!,I just cannot believe that the same woman who wrote Paradise and Perfect could have wrote this book. It just was not on the same level. The characters were well developed. But the storyline was not. It was not believable. When and how did Diana and Cole fall in love? Did I miss something?
2,This book lacked the basic requirement needed: passion.,"I have read several books written by Judith McNaught, however, this book did not live up to the standards. The storyline did not start until the middle of the book. When the plot started to unfold it was very weak. It did not captivate me at all. The love scenes were very short and dry. This is not what I would have expected after reading Paradise and Whitney, my love."
2,This novel did not focus on the characters.,"It was my idea that this novel would focus on the emotions of the characters. Instead, it detailed the business aspect of their lives. The best part of the book is the beginning, when we are drawn into Diana's life. The latter part of the novel loses the depth of the characters as it details the superficial aspect of their lives. The repetition about how Diana and Cole became successful tends to emotionally distance the reader from the characters."
2,a somewhat disappointing read for a J McNaught fan,"First time readers: Her other books are MUCH better. This books is only for hard-core JMN fans -- and not even them, actually. It's such a disappointment! I kept checking if it was written by Ms McNaught, it was THAT bad."
2,Not McNaught's best...not even mediocre!,"This was not a romance. It was too much detail about the secondary characters. She wrote so much about everyone that you did not have time to really like any of them, especially Diana and Cole. Everything worked out too easily for them. It was not like Perfect or Whitney, My Love! It was not worth purchasing the hardcover. I will be more cautious the next time"
2,Definatly not one of her best,"I read this and was shocked that McNaught could produce such a low quality of writing. This looked like something a highschooler might write, but not Judith. What usually gets me about McNaught books is that I get really mad at them. During this one, I didn't. Her books usually make me feel like I've never felt before, but I have felt the emotion this book made me feel... bored. My first McNaught book I read was Perfect, and that's turned out as my favorite. If any of you have read that book, you've probably gotten very mad at it. That's what I love about McNaught. You can be mad one minute, and extremely happy the next. This book didn't give any of that out. I was VERY dissapointed. Where did her creativity go?"
5,great tender story,"I read this book years ago and didn't like it because it wasn't like her others....I just reread it and loved it! I love the characters and their stories. I loved the build up of their friendship and their conversational banter, I loved that it wasn't all passion but what was there was tasteful. It was a great read, I am glad I picked it up again. Wish there were more books like this one."
3,what happened here?,"First of all i would like to say that I love Judith McNaught, all of her work is amazing. If I had been rating this novel on a comparison with the other romance novels that are out there now I would give it a five, however I'm rating this novel on a comparison of her others. It lacked the excitement that was so evident in her other novels, though i do agree it was tender. I agree with what the other review said about how Cole never said he loved Diana... that got to me too, probably because i'm a die hard feminist, god knows. This book is not a bad book, it's anything but that, but it is far from McNaught's best."
1,Clearly her worst yet.,This book was so boring it took forever to finish it. It lacked the passion and energy found in her other books. Not one to be bought for keeps.
4,"Really good, I read it in a day!!!","I found the book humorous at time and it kept my attention...so much so, I couldn't put it down... Judith is great!"
3,Didn't meet my expectations.,"Since reading ""Until You"", I have been waiting to be as entranced and excited.I was thrilled to finally pick up her new book. I thought thebook took a long time to get to the point and then didn't haveenough time to make it. Judith McNaught is known for her greatromance writing and didn't use this talent to it's full potentialthis time around."
3,not one of McNaught's best books,"The final draft of Remember When bears no resemblance to thesynopsis. Instead, we are reunited with the characters fromMcNaught's short story, Double Exposure. It was an OK read,but, IMHO, not worth hardcover price. It was off to a slowstart when the first half the book is filled with flashbacksand no tension ever builds between the main characters. Toomuch focus on what should have been only secondary charactersand background. There was no real conflict to resolve beforeour hero and heroine could pair off, just a sort of ""Oh woeis me, look at all my problems."" Definitely NOT one ofMcNaught's best."
3,It was OK,"Entertaining read. It was more subtle than other JM's books. There was a significant lack of ""bedroom scenes"" as compared to her other novels. However, I did enjoy the Foster family anecdotes, especially the one about the camping trip. This story, in my opinion centered around the strong family ties among the Bretton-Foster and not so much around Diana and Cole's love story. But I must admit that unlike other readers who complained about too much business talk, I truly enjoyed those scenes. They somehow reminded me of the relationship between our beloved Matt and Meredith from Paradise..."
3,Not that great.,"I enjoyed reading Judith McNaught's ""Paradise"" and ""Perfect"", so I thought I would give this one a try. The first half of the book kept me interested, but there was way too much explaining on both sides and I got bored of the novel pretty soon. I know Diana was supposed to have fallen in love with Cole when she was a teen, but I couldn't see how that was possible, either. Maybe there wasn't enough dialogue or scenes involving the two, but I didn't feel as if they had any real connection. The story was dragged on for too long, and I found myself wondering when the story would be over. Anyway, the first part of the novel kept me interested enough to give out three stars."
1,J.M.'s worst ever!!!!!!!!!,"I absolutely loathed this book. It was awful. Don't get me wrong, I love Judith McNaught and have read all of her books (Paradise is my all-time favorite romance), but there was just no redeeming this book. Diana was okay in some ways ( she was a bit wimpy for my taste), but I found Cole to be completely reprehensible. He was arrogant, domineering, and just downright unlikeable. Most of Judith's heroes usually display an arrogance and ruthlessness that can make them quite disagreeable at times, but they are usually given a wonderful quality that redeems them (in Matt's case, it was his sensitivity and understanding; most of her other heroes have similar qualities.) Cole did not. He came off as cold and ruthless to the end. I just never warmed up to him. Judith could have done much better."
4,"A great sequel to Corey's story in ""Double Exposure"".","After reading Corey's story in ""Double Exposure"" , in A GIFT OF LOVE, I was wondering how her step-sister, Diana, would have a story of her own. Judith McNaught did a good job of not repeating herself too much unlike some other sequels of other authors. Diana was just as I expected her to be. Cole was a hero and he was real enough to come with some domineering and self-confident traits. After all, he was supposed to be a very successful businessman and he shouldn't be PERFECT - nobody is."
5,"A touching love story, hard to put down!",I loved this book! The characters were well-developed and the storyline every woman's fantasy come true!
3,It was okay but.................,"...I kept waiting for the story line to pick up speed. I had just read Paradise before rhis book, and I totally loved it. I got this book expecting great things and got virtually squat. I wanted a romantic page turner, and got somthing else. There wasn't much chemistry between Diana and Cole, and it took way too long for them to grow up and get together. I could hardly believe it was a #1 bestseller. If you want a good book, read Whitney, My Love or Paradise. They're much better."
5,Once again... outstanding!,"I don't understand how anyone could give this book less than 5 stars. It is not written in Judith McNaught's typical style... couple meets, couple falls in love, misunderstandings occur where both think the other has wronged them, and then all works out... this was better! If you enjoyed 'Paradise' and its sequel 'Perfect', I guarantee you will love this one. 'Remember When' briefly mentions Matt Farrell from 'Paradise' and it is about a once nobody turned tycoon but it is not boring because there isn't so much strife between the main couple. I think it's better because of it. There is enough strife in real life. Cole meets Diana when he's a college student working as a stable hand and she a pampered but not stuck up daughter of a wealthy man. They have a great friendship from the beginning... and it only gets better. I love reading when a couple stands up to anybody for the other. If you don't like that then don't read it. This will remain in my keeper shelf."
5,"Astounding Book, Read it again and again!","Remember When is a great romance novel, and the only one that can come close to it is Something Wonderful.I love the way Cole and Diana's relationship was able to develop without sex being mentioned on every other page. This was a gentle romance that blossomed, and the readers were able to feel the strong emotions between Cole and Diana.I especially loved the scene when Cole gave Diana a stuffed kitten for her Sweet Sixteen. It was nice to see that Diana wasn't so snobby that she would scoff at such a gift.It was humorous when Diana compared Cole's lovemaking to Rosemary's Baby, and when Cole complained his ego was hurt.Wonderful romance, the best contemporary I have ever read. This one is a keeper."
2,ABOUT AS ENGAGING AS PLAIN OATMEAL---,"Rather like a bland puzzle with a few pieces missing. This story seemed to drone on and on without really saying anything. Certainly not up to Judith McNaught's usual standards, more on the line of a generic harlequin-type romance."
1,Super Boring.......Yawn,"I love Judith's historical romances such as Whitney My Love and Once & Always, so I thought I'll give her modern setting romances a try. Boy! So disappointed!The story was super boring, with characters that were flat and forgettable. The writing and dialogues made me nearly fell asleep. It just went on and on talking about the characters' businesses blah blah blah. Hey, this is suppose to be a romance, not some 100 ways to run business or get rich self help book! Talking about romance, there was hardly any sparks between the characters. Theirs was just so simple, so convenient, so smooth, so dull.The only reason I forced myself to finish this book was because I've paid for the rental of this book from a book rental shop, and wanted to get the full worth. This book has really diminished my interest in her other modern romances."
2,DO NOT start here...,"As you all know McNaught is one of; if not my number one author... So with that said I have to give this book a low rating. I felt like ""Remember When"" was a lazy write and it mirrored (almost exactly) one of her other books. I will say it started out as a ""could not put it down read"", but somewhere around the middle it fell apart. I know she can bring more than this to the table and that's why this review is so negative. If you've never read McNaught DO NOT start with this one. Try ""A Kingdom of Dreams"", ""Paradise"" or ""Almost Heaven""."
1,Really horrible,"I've never read a McNaught book before, but I've always wondered whether or not I would enjoy one of her books....well, now I know. This was a sad waste of my time.The characters were not well-developed at all. They were like cardboard cutouts of what romance novels characters should be...like a novel that makes fun of romances. Too much of the novel was dedicated to scenes that had nothing to do with the interaction between the main characters, as if this book was trying to NOT concentrate on the romance. Yet, this is a romance novel, so it didn't make the least amount of sense. Either write a romance or don't."
4,A treasure of a read,"Magazine publisher Diana Foster is publicly jilted by her fiancee, and an old crush from high school steps in to ease the impact of the negative publicity on her family business.I enjoyed reading this not-too-complex modern romance that still had some old-fashioned charm. The romance moved a bit quickly from nonchalance to undying love, but McNaught nailed the characterization of the old-money families from Houston. Having lived in Houston myself for many years, I appreciated the accuracy of her portrayal of the city and its elite."
3,Boring and predictable.,"For some reason, I've been reading quite a few of Judith McNaught's books recently and they all come out the same. As with all romance novels, of course, it's always a ""happily ever after""ending and in her epilogues, there's always a happy, loving wonderful ending with a child or children in the picture. Come on! Get with the real world!!!"
2,She's losing her touch,"I was very disappointed with Remember When as well as her previous book Until You. I am really starting to worry that we won't be seeing any more stories out of Ms. McNaught that meet the standard she set with Perfect, Paradise and Almost Heaven. The romance as well as the male lead were terribly underdeveloped. I miss her longer books where the romance and characters were so fully explored."
2,"TERRIBLE, REALLY. . . .","This from the woman who brought us ""Perfect"" and ""Until You""? Ugh. The plot makes no sense. And what was that ""Rosemary's Baby"" scene? Cole, if he were a sensible man, would have dropped Diana like a hot coal."
2,Not McNaught's best book,"This was not a terrible reading, but because I had high hopes for McNaught's books, it was disapointing. If you her other books (Paradise, Once and Always for example), you'll see what I mean. I didn't get me hooked as her previous books did."
3,I've read better...,"I've read a few of JM's books, and they are good but somehow they don't have any conclusions to storylines they started. For example, at the beginning of the book, Cole has a sexy, smart girlfriend and doesn't want to get married OR have kids. Then next time he's single. It doesn't say why or when or anything they broke up. He's so adament about not getting married or having kids that I was shocked when, after making love to Diana, he has a sudden revelation that he wants all that stuff after being together A WEEK. It doesn't give us a reason why he doesn't, but the reader has to infer it from his past. They both have successful businesses and it's like those don't matter, that they can pick up and move half a company by the next day. It was an ok read, but it left something to be desired. There were too many incomplete storylines and the only resolution I saw was that they were married and lived happily ever after. Not very believeable."
4,A good read,"It's been years since I've read this book, and yet all I have to see is ""CEO Diana, Cole, expensive necklace"" and I am instantly reminded of this book. If you like fast paced romances or drama, you won't like this book. There's plenty of both, but paced, not rushed. For an afternoon alone, or curling up in a bubble bath, this is a good one."
1,Remember When--,"I used to be Mcnaught #1 fan and would buy anything with her name on it. But after reading this disaster, not anymore!!! Next time I'll take take the book out of my library first to make sure its worth buying."
1,Writing was confusing and disjointed,"The first half of the book which describes Diana's childhood and the beginnings of her friendship with Cole is solid and cohesive. Alas, when the story fast-forwards a few years, the writing falls apart and the characters' actions don't make sense in many instances. From the moment Diana and Cole decide to marry for the sake of convenience, the pacing of the story is accelerated to the point where the story loses all realism. For example, Diana does and says some silly things which are never fully explained. This book gave me the impression that the author must have been very distracted while writing it because it certainly comes across in the story."
3,Had potential...,"I would have loved to have read the story of the grown-up versions of the 2 youths, Diana and Cole, that we meet in the first half of Remember When. I really would have. Unfortunately, the 2nd half of this book seemed to have nothing in common with the first half. There are very few similarities between the young Diana and the adult Diana, or the young Cole and the adult Cole. They seem to be two completely different people with no connection or reference to their shared past. It's too bad, because it could have been such a great book. I gave it 3 stars only out of respect for Judith McNaught, whose other books I treasure."
5,Props go out to Ms. McNaught all the way!!!!,"Remember When is the third book that I have read from Judith McNaught and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Diana and Cole were brought to life and I could see myself in relation to them. Diana is your average homegirl, she makes you feel like you have met her already. This is your classic modern romance story. After you have read it you will feel like this could happen to anyone. I encourage everyone to read it. You'll love it!!!"
1,Not up to Judith McNaught's usual standard.,"Judith McNaught is not one of the more prolific writers, so when she has a new novel come out (in paperback) I eagerly buy and read it. While many people felt it was not worth the price of a hardcover, I thought it was not even worth the price of a paperback. Ms McNaught told us more about the main character's family than I really cared to know in the first place, but then she kept telling us more and more of the same information about this family. When she finally got the two supposedly main characters together, almost three forths of the way through the book, they fall into bed togther and guess what? All their problems were solved! I think McNaught developed the relationship between Diana and her stepsister more than the relationship between Diana and Cole, the hero. And frankly, by the time she finally got Diana nad Cole together, I really didn't care any longer."
4,Hello?,How could someone only give this wonderful story only one star. It is extremely well written and one falls in love with the characters (Cole and the entire Foster family) almost immediately upon meeting them. Remember When is a wonderful story of love between two very intriguing and entertaining characters. My only request is that Judith write a longer story about Spencer and Corey and include (of course) Dianna and Cole.
1,Remember When? Forget it NOW!,"A stupid book - the worst kind of romance novel...absolutely trite. How about text like:"" He was motorcyles and blue jeans and battered duffel bags with the need to blaze his own trails through life...She was BMWs and prom gowns and matched luggage, with a need to stay on smooth paved roads,"" I tried to finish the book, thinking maybe it was a parody or that it would take a completely bizarre twist. I couldn't force myself to get past page 81. Don't waste your time reading this like I wasted mine...there's simply nothing there."
1,Very Disappointing! Expected much more,"I was very disappointed when i read this book, i was cravingfor another ""Paradise"" and instead read a book that had noneof the passion and love that was in Judith's earlier novels. The main character ""Cole"" didn't even come close to ""Matt"", and I can count the number of pages that was dedicated to the leading characters only. I'll say it again, if you want to read a great book read ""Paradise""!! my all time favourite, i suppose i should stop comparing other books to it."
1,BORING!!!!,"This book was terrible. I bought it at the cover price thinking it would definitely be worth the extra money. It wasn't. I kept waiting for things to get better, but i was gravely mistaken. The characters and the plot were mediocre at best. The love story, drama, and suspense were not even worth commenting about."
2,Maybe she has set the bar too high for herself...,First let me say that I am a big JM fan. She is my favorite romance writer. I love almost all of her books. But this one wasn't nearly as good as any of her others. The characters were very underdeveloped and they did totally bizaar things and acted as if it were the most normal thing in the world. It started out with real promise and could have been so much better. But even if she had added more the story line was just too unrealistic. I found myself skipping paragraphs just to finish it which is something I rarely ever do. I think she really dropped the ball with this one. But maybe I am judging it too harshly; I guess there can never be another Matt and Meredith...
1,A Big Disappointment,"I have loved Judith McNaught ever since I read Whitney, My Love. She is my favorite author because she lets you see the feelings develop and deepen between her characters. None of that was evident in this novel. As a love story, it is forced and abrupt. We have no understanding of why and how they fell in love. The only saving grace of this book are the other characters that carry the book through. It does not read like one of McNaught's works at all. I wasted money buying this one."
3,Not her best.,"I loved the characters of Cole and Diana! Cole seemed like the ultimate fantasy hero and Diana was perfect for him. I thought it was great to have a couple that liked each other before falling madly in love. Their scenes when they were younger were very beliebvable. Unfortunately, they seemed like secondary characters in their own book! I got the feeling that the book was more of an epic saga about the lives of the Foster-Britton clan than a romance between Cole and Diana. I read more about Grandma, Grandpa, Mary, and Corey than I really wanted to. The plot seemed a bit uneven since so much attention was devoted to those secondary characters. Even the epilogue seemed like it was thrown together at the last minute. And there were no special or memorable love scenes between Cole and Diana; their ""honeymoon"" was over in a page or two. I would like to see Cole and Diana again; I hope Judith McNaught will include them in her next book as she did with Matt and Meredith in ""Perfect""."
5,Anita Blakke Vampire hunter series,I think these books are amaizing. They draw you in and you don't want to put them down. I love the twists that she gives the books and how detailed they are. Each time you finish one book you can't wait to get to the next one.
5,The Laughing Corpse,I absolutely love this series...I finished the Meredeth Gentry series in a week (7 books) and started the Anita Blake series. They are the best books I've read since the Twilight Series.
5,Got me Started,This 4-book set was the first I had read of the Anita Blake series. I have since ordered another 5 books from that series and will order the rest after I read those. These are really well written and move right along with interesting characters and plots.
1,This Series Sucks (Pun Intended),"Of all the vampire series this one is not worth the money I spent on this boxed set. I hated Anita Blake. Anita is not someone worth wanting to find out about. So I didn't. She doesn't measure up to heroines in other vampire series.Stephanie Meyers' Twilight Series - FAB, the book that started it all. Edward or Jacob? Both for me.L. J. Smith's Vampire Diaries - Pretty good. Good enough to have a TV series.Melissa De La Cruz Blue Bloods - Excellent. The most unique twist on the vampire lore that I have read so far.J. R. Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood - Exciting. Who wouldn't want one of these brothers to have your back.Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse - Quirky and fun. Even better than True Blood (although some would disagree).Then there is Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake - truly bites (in a bad way). I could not get past the first 50 pages. If you don't have my attention by the first few chapters, its not worth reading. Sorry, just my opinion."
4,Earlier Blakes Better,"These first four Anita Blakes were the best in the series, so putting these for a group sale together was good thinking from an author going bad. Most people read vampire novels to read about vampires, not about the extreme sexuality that plagues the later novels and rid's them of an even relatively good plot line. The beginning 4 novels in the series are filled with intense character's who almost always draw you in, even the heroine Blake does a relatively good job in these books of maintaining her renowned status. The best part about these installments in the Blake books are the muder mysteries that are incorporated with her police identity. Hamilton does a good job of pulling the reader's in with intense and interesting stories filled with supernatural politics, character's past lives, and the old fashioned plotline, will Anita save the day again? WARNING: not for the faint of heart or those who can't stomach some serious gore."
4,Entertaing - though seems to be a slow read,"I am enjoying these books. I am, but I just feel like they are kinda slow. They are no Sookie Stackhouse novels. It just seems that there is nothing to make me have to read more and more and more.... Good Series, I would check it out if you are into the supernatural/romantic/mystery type book..."
3,Very Basic Overview,"This DVD could prove very helpful for the person who absolutely knows nothing about their Canon EOS 30D. This DVD goes through all the functions/buttons on the camera. The only problem with this DVD is that it is so basic. It fails to go into depth on the any of the bottons/functions. The DVD has a sort of rushed feel to it to try to get to the end of the ""show"" as soon as possible. Quality of graphics, and sound were very good. Not recommended for the person who already has a handle on the ins and outs of their camera."
5,Yippee!!,"Great ProductGreat PriceI can use my Filter Queen again!Look out dust bunnies and rhinos, gonna getcha!;-)"
2,Not the original filters for the Filter Queen,"These filters and cut pieces of a cheap filter paper, it is a fight to get the filters to seal inside the unit. Cannot use in my filter Queen vacuum. I wanted it to work and the discounted price."
1,DO NOT ORDER,"This item, when received, does NOT look anything like the picture and it DOES NOT fit my Little Pro Plus. I would rate it a 0 but 1 is the lowest rating allowed.The picture however looks exactly like the part needed."
1,ODD FISH ....,"SILLY sex-game movie along the lines of GAMES [Simone Signoret] with an equally silly ending. Mediocre young couple without any oomph in their normal lives invent personalities [Dr. Crippen and lover!] in the bedroom ... enter an odd older woman {Cilento channeling Dietrich] who ""kind of"" secudes both and introdces a new character spin [Das Red Baron!]- quaint and probably shcoking for 1968 London's swinging set ..... but really quite dull.Jackson chews up the scenery shows glimpses of ""Women In Love"", etc and brays her way along merrily......not really worth your while ... only if you really must - and Jackson's beauty spot moves around ..... make-up?????"
1,Preety Pictures,Pretty pictures and a nice overview of sites here but not much in the way of practical information. Best for deciding where to go but not for planning logistics.
5,A Very Strong Effort,"Wilson's take on the early Irish immigrants to America is both thought provoking and important. Some of his points are a little strong: I'm not certain that the United Irishmen can be seen as a primary reason for the downfall of the Federalist Party. Still, he backs up his assertions with reasonable facts, and in so doing certainly opens debate on the matter. He does a fine job of showing both the radical nature of these immigrants as well as their scattered geographic nature (Denis Driscol, who became editor of the Augusta [Georgia] Chronicle is a perfect example of both). Wilson's book also emphasizes the Irishness of the United Irishmen, a point which should not be overlooked, given how the Dissenters in Ireland were appropriated by the establishment after 1798, and how modern America wants to emphasize the ""Scots-Irishness"" of the Dissenters. Wilson reveals these men as truly IRISH in thought and action."
5,Great book! How to analyze the market place made easy.,"This book is well written, to the point, and extremely useful. Dr. Nugent really makes market analysis, and the corresponding tools to do so, straightforward and easy to understand. I recommend it highly."
5,Ironic,I find this book very informative. In fact i am going to take it to Hiquey to guide me in finding the perfect Honda CRV . Thank you for inspiring me to do it on my own. This book will change peoples lives.
5,Fabulous,My Husband Really loved this watch. He has recieved lot's of compliments since I gave it too him for a gift.
4,The kid loves it.,"Son was very excited to receive this. Still loves it after a month. The design is very nice, but the material is a little cheap for the price."
2,Not the best,"Pretty expensive for the quality. For some reason, the fabric tag is on the top of the comforter, so it hits my son in the face when he's trying to sleep! The only thing it has going for it, is that the design is cool."
4,"Sister's Keeper, entertainment worth the investment","I initially purchased this video to get a better look at the talents of MS. Denise Boutte'. I must confess I was not disappointed in her presentation of her craft.As for the movie it was entertaining but nothing spectacular. Eric Roberts a well established and prolific actor turns in a superb portrayal of a middle management boss of for heir assassins.Kent Faulcon delivers a good performance but a bit dry for a lead actor, who's responsibility it is to sell the story.I enjoyed the film it had an interesting plot line but know real surprises. I take that back but you'll have to watch the video to find our where the surprise is.Like I said, I did not come to the this film expecting a lot, I just wanted to see if Ms. Boutte' could throw down and I was not disappointed on the score.Look forward to seeing her any where except as part of: Meet The Browns."
5,Sobering,"Steyn's sobering elucidation of Western Europe's continuing social decline leaves the reader wondering if America must once again lead the battle to liberate the free world. Unlike the first two world wars, where the victims of oppression rallied to defeat their oppressors, today's victims (Western Europe) aim to appease their pending conqueror's (Islam).Rather than doting suppositions, Steyn uses hard statistics to demonstrate the effects of secularism on Europe's declining population. Native European couples are averaging 1.2 offspring; Euro Islamics 4.5. London alone has experienced a population explosion of over 1 million Islamics in the past 30 years.Europeans are playing in their cafes, enjoying yearly 8 week entitlement vacations, abstaining from procreation, whilst their invited replacements -Islamics- are breeding with focused intent.America saved Europe twice in the last century....we may be mobilizing for the 3rd campaign."
3,"Funny, silly and scary!","A very funny writer can always make you suspend your disbelief and Steyn does just that. Well written and enjoyable read, but there really isn't too much information that is new, just a slightly skewered view about what it means in our current world situation. The only thing that bothered me, and I recommend you read it anyway, is that as most conservative ideologues consistently do, Steyn tries to convince you by spreading fear. Many a truth they say is spoken in jest, so take it with a grain of salt, and don't feel guiulty for laughing even if you're a left wing, bleeding heart liberal. It's all harmless fun and always interesting to read someone elses view on current events even if you don't completely agree."
5,just the facts,"Amazon has written a lenthy and accurate description of the content of this book so I won't rehash it here. This book is simply excellent. It is clear, concise, and meticulously researched. A reader may be disheartened by Steyn's conclusions but the facts support his argument: the future belongs to Islam and a return to the dark ages unless there is a sea change in the consciousness of the West."
1,Offensive and Poorly-Written,"I accidentally purchased this book online and, after realizing my mistake, sat down to read through a few chapters. Everything I read was unfounded and offensive, the epitome of partisan hackery. If you value your ability to think freely and interact compassionately with the world, do NOT read this book."
1,Mark Steyn is Pure Garbage.,"Here's my point....This book is altimately the expression of a narrow minded bigot who possess the same mantality as those pre-revolutionary and revolutionary America who believed SLAVERY is JUSTIFIED by the BIBLE, and therefore good. We all know now that all those who played part in this unforgivable crime in the name of Christ and white supremacy are a bunch of jackels.America, or any nation for that matter is far from perfect. America alone will lead to its own disctruction. IGNORANT RODENTS who believe that Judaio-Christian relegions are the only answer swim in their own filth. They need to wake up from their nightmare and accept the world for what it is.Waking up to the izan is a given right in the American constitution under freedome of religion.Don't waste your time reading this Garbage....."
5,"Magnificent -- Jaw-dropping, Attention-grabbing","The most honest, straightforward and politically INcorrect presentation of the Grand Plan of Islam ever written."
5,"WOW, a real eye opener!!!","Mark Steyn has my vote, he shows, with FACTS, not emotion, the danger to our entire way of life that Islam brings. It is too late for Europe, they have committed suicide. We can STILL SAVE OURSELVES. Our country was based on the RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL, not so-called ""civil rights"". Without individual rights, you have majority rule-TYRANNY OF THE MASSES!"
1,"""America"" is not a country. It is a continent","Mr. Steyn commits a mistake. He should know that America is not a country. It is a continent. He should have called his book ""The United States alone""."
1,BLAH BLAH BUY MY BOOK,"Give someone a radio talk show and suddenly they are the supreme expert of the universe. This book is a load of the usual hatemonger's crap,mixed with few distorted insights, which will be very popular with the rabble. Don't bother, go find a book by someone who actually knows something. But, we all know people who listen to talk radio don't read anyway, they just buy whatever little fantasy's their heroes throw out and put it on the shelf beside Mein Kampf. I will say that this guy is a least smarter than Ann Smoulter..."
5,A Frightening Scenario of the Future!,"Not much has changed in the Islamic world since a 7th century psychopath puked up a religion! Its either convert to its perverted ideology or else! Not anymore, enough is enough, the war has begun, we will kill every last one of them if thats what it takes! Be prepared, armageddon awaits!"
3,A must read for everyone,"The book tends to be repetitive but, it is well written by a very amusing writer about a very serious subject. This book sets out very well the threats that muslims represent to all others in the world, including themselves. It is full of an interesting record of atrocities perpetrated by muslim fundamentalists throughout the world which are very frightening. It is a must read for everyone."
5,America Alone: About what you would expect.,"Mark Steyn is certainly one of the most worldly commentators of our time. If you weren't worried that the Muslims might actually WIN and impose Sharia law in the U.S., Mr. Steyn explains why you should be with blow-by-blow accounts of how the Muslims take over countries simply by immigrating and having children. Mr. Steyn shows how France anD England are already tittering on the brink of Sharia calamity and outlines what life in the U.S. might be like under Sharia law a hundred years from now. The military battles are just a distraction. If you don't want your grandchildren forced to give up their music, burn their books, and pay a tax for being non-believers, start by reading this book."
5,A fantastic - humorous writer who has written an Eye-Opener !,"I love Mark Steyn's style of writing....I cannot help but laugh myself to death all the way thru the book !!On a more serious note, this book is an eye-opener !! It tells us, especially those who has no understanding of Islam, its followers and its goal of what is actually happening in Europe and about the world's most mentioned conflict.Though I am unwilling to take sides without a deep enough understanding, but I seem to be able to relate and agreed with everything Mark has to say in the book. I am very much persuaded to see things as he sees them. Guess it must be my English education and living in a democracy that does it."
5,Banned In Canada,"Mark Steyn is one of the funniest, maybe THE funniest political writer of our time. Unfortunately, the subject matter of this book is not very funny. Demographically, the America I grew up in and love is going down the tubes. Slowly, but going nonetheless.I already knew that, but I didn't know how bad it was getting around the rest of the world. Statistics are statistics; they just are. We in the West are not reproducing. We are below replacement rates. It IS funny to hear folks complain about overpopulation when there is none, at least not here. Any overpopulation we have here is imported.The final point, that Muslims are reproducing far faster than the West, are immigrating to western countries, and will overtake the native populations in a generation or two, is why this book is banned in Canada."
5,Disturbing,This is a very easy read . It is disturbing and seems to be well researched in so far as I have been able (and willing) to verify. I believe this is a must read for every American. It is clear that this book is not irrational bashing of Islam and is generally accurate. No open minded thinking person can simply ignore the problems presented. Mark Steyn is as entertaining as he is provocative.
4,America Alone was an informative read,The book gave some fascinating demographic information that helped me understand the growth and probable future of the Islamic movement worldwide. The impact in the U.S. and Europe was particularly good. The writing style was both humorous and chilling. It was a good read and I recommend it. Two of my adult daughters have wanted to borrow it and are reading it now.
5,A Must-Read!,"This book was every bit as good as I had heard. I've always enjoyed Mark Steyn, but hadn't gotten a chance to read this yet because I had a stack of books in front of it. That's my loss, because this was one of the most profound and eye-opening books I've ever read. To be honest, I pay pretty close attention to this conflict we find ourselves in, so most of the individual facts in this book weren't exactly foreign to me. But Steyn pulls all this together and presents it in such a concise, clear and entertaining way that I was able to put the pieces together in a way I hadn't even imagined. His demographic data alone is shocking, and should make every person in Europe and Canada sit up and take serious note - I'll be paying very close attention to what happens over the next few years ""across the pond"", as they say, for how goes Europe, so will eventually go America. I plan to buy several more copies of this book and hand them out to friends and family. I highly suggest it."
5,America Needs to Know This,It is an amazing book. All of America needs to know how current changes in demography could change the world as we know it.
1,"Fraud, propaganda","Steyn does not give his sources or statistics for obvious reasons : his statements on the actual birthrates of European Muslims are fabrications. The Muslim population in Europe is slightly more than 4% and its fertility rates are similar to the ""native"" Europeans at the second or third generation. Immigration in Europe was brought down to much more controlled rates in recent years. Real demographic data that completely invalidates Steyn's thesis can be found at Princeton (Religiousness and Fertility among European Muslims by CHARLES F. WESTOFF and TOMAS FREJKA), Brookings Institution (papers by Justin Vaisse e.g.) and European statistics bureaus. They are easily accessible."
1,Amazing !,"As European, I read this book with interest. Democraty depends on the amount of voters and their ideas. As soon as the Muslims will replace the other polulations with their larger breeding, they democratically will impose their 7th century way of life."
1,Reader completely ruins this audio book!,"For the 2nd time in as many months, this reader has ruined an audio book that I was looking forward to. (The other book was Confessions of an Economic Hitman.) The narrator could perhaps read a children's book, but not a book that deals with serious subjects. His reading takes whatever credibility the author has and destroys it. What a shame."
1,You are better off reading the Book of Revelation,"Instead of the Red Scare (those damn pinko commies) we now have the Islamic threat. Read ""The Concept of the Political"" by Carl Schmidtt in order to understand the necessity of creating an existentially threatening 'other' for the sake of reinforcing national cohesion and identity. As some may know, Schmidtt was influential (especially in his critique of liberalism) in both National Socialist circles and in neo-conservative circles.This is a re-hashing of Huntington, only Steyn is even more alarmist and pessimistic (who could have thought it was possible) in his 'prophetic' (read sarcasm) judgments. If you want a real book on the decline of empire that has a historical perspective beyond the past 15 years, then read Kennedy's ""The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers""."
3,A serious subject. at times poorly presented,"This is the first book I have read by Mr. Steym, not the first book pointing out the danger of Muslim usurpation of the Western civilisation.The book is very well researched, and gives numerous examples of Western PC follies. As main reasons for the Muslim usurpation, he gives the following (or so I understood)1.) European women do not breed enough2.) Europeans no longer uphold the Christian belief.Therefore America is less endangered: American women breed better, and Americans are better Christians.Unfortunately, the ""witty"" style of writing distracts from the seriousness of the subject matter.Also, I missed political guidance, as to what should be done to stem the onslaught, other than having more children, and better belief. Hence, the book ends a bit open ended so to speak. This is a pity."
4,AMERICA ALONE=Extremely thought-provoking & sobering book!,"The critical importance of this book is its ability to 'grab' one's mind and FORCE it to confront a reality which may easily escape our attention and even our thought in our pre-occupation of our ever-busy living-in-the-present! A very serious, 'rapid-fire', sociological, analyses supported by overwhelming statistics and compelling implications which should be of concern to EVERYONE--- that is, who cares about the world in which their grandchildren and, yes, children will experience! Recommend it highly!"
4,America Alone,"What an eye opener of a book. I had no idea Western Europe had such aproblem with the encroachment of the Islamic religion and the culture that comes with it. Ameica is doomed if we do not wake up soon, seal off our borders, and ditch the current trendy, secular, politically correct approach to everything that remains still ""good"" about America."
4,Shocking Statistics,"""Demographics"" was a word I hadn't heard it a long time, but I'm certainly familiar with now, thanks to Mark Steyn's ""America Alone.""Yes, author Steyn's sarcastic humor is very funny in spots but, overall, this book was very sobering to me, very chilling. I had no idea the Muslim influence was so prevalent in Europe, and a large part of that due to the declining birth rate of the Europeans. Some of his statistics in this 2006 book are downright shocking, and I'm very curious to see what's in his new book, due out in August.Steyn's extensive vocabulary doesn't make for a quick read, but his content is powerful stuff and really makes you think."
1,Scary is Right!,"I bought this book from Amazon on the advice of a friend whom I thought was fairly enlightened and then I read it with horror - horror at the simplistic and ignorant text before me. I didn't find his ""facts"" scary. I found the reviews scary. I had to read the first 50 reviews, all 5 star, until I came to a wonderful review by a person who actually knows the Moslem world. He gave it one star and came close to vilifying Mark Steyn, something I am willing to do.If those positive reviews are how America thinks, no wonder we have enemies. They are scary, scary. And war mongering. Apparently they do want to end the world as we know it."
1,Standard neocon drivel,"He rambles on about Germany as typical of technically moribund Europe. In 2006, Germany's exports exceeded those of the mighty US by more than $100 million. And Germany's were machinery, electronics, chemical products, etc, not corn and soybeans.He offers no solutions except maybe a return to the Crusades where we slaughter Muslims right and left, not to mention getting tough with Iraqis. He didn't identify which of the factions there, or all of them, he wants to show who is boss. Steyn, Rummy, and Bush - we won't have an asset left with them in charge."
1,I need to return this book for another copy!,"January 11, 2007Greetings!I didn't know how to handle this. The copy of the book that you sent does not have all of the pages and duplicates other pages! Specifically, pages 1-96 are OK. Then, pages 97-160 are missing; pages 224 to the end are missing; and pages 161-224 are duplicated. This is the way it left the publishers bindery. Please contact me ASAP and advise how we can resolve this problem. I need a new copy of this book and you'll want to see this messed-up edition. THANKS! John M. Vente (630) 968-3339"
4,The Real Population Bomb,"Mark Steyn, in his humorous and self-effacing way, points out the critical defect in advanced Socialist societies--they are anti-human. Somehow, all of the financial and social programs add up to depressed, non-productive, and non-reproductive old people looking to the political system to continue paying them their pensions.Well-shouted, but not loudly enough for the affected societies to hear."
4,I agree with much of what the other reviwers said.,"The one thing omitted, that caused me to remove one star, is Mr. Steyn's giving short shrift to reform within Islam. He glosses over it, probably in recognition of the admitted difficulties. But I would have liked to see him discuss someone like Shaykh Professor Abdul Hadi Palazzi, head of the Italian Muslim Association, who is seriously anti-Islamist and pro-Israel. The shaykh bases his views on the Qur'an. Not only does Mr. Steyn not discuss him; he does not even mention him."
5,"Put down whatever other geo-political book your reading, it can wait till after you've read this masterpiece","Stunningly succint. The insight and original thoughts per paragragh is mind boggling. The guy is amazing.He labels, characterizes, and dissects all that is suicidal for Western Culture.The primary impulse vs secondary impulse for governments is spot on.His demography breakdown is in-depth, and yes, scary as hell, especially if you have kids. You thought Mayberry is gone now, you ain't seen nuthin.His humor is great too, as well as the brit vernacular which every American finds endearing. Heh.I already have a small waiting list of people ready to read this book after me. If you're not on a waiting list, order and read asap."
5,"great laughs, deadly serious","If you want to laugh and cry at the same time, this book is for you.Declining birthrates, mindless multiculturalism, and a complete refusal to face reality have placed the West in a very serious position. Time is running out, and there are no easy answers.Steyn will make you laugh. There is constant humor, which is welcome. The overall subject matter is not funny. Its frightening. One can only hope many will read this wonderful book. One can hope--even nore--many will read it and come to their senses."
3,"Decent read, but ultimately doesn't offer much hope","Mark Stein is talking about, in a round-about way, how the worlds populations are dwindling... except for Muslim populations. And that's pretty much it. So what exactly was the point of the book? That Europe is corrupt and it's populations aren't meeting a replenishment rate? That Islamic families average 5 children and that France will be a Muslim nation someday?I dunno, I read this and at the end though, so what? This was just look at the direction of demographics in the world and little more. Are we supposed to read this and then start having more children? Or was the message to avoid Europeans?I didn't get much out of this book, but I did find it amusing and humorous at times. Stein does frequently address the ""yeah buts"", and I had quite a few along the way. Glad I only borrowed this from the library."
3,America Alone,"Interesting and griping fact centered book. However, authors attempt at humor while writing of such a serious subject did not sit well with me. I am so afraid he is right, just not funny."
5,America Alone,Heard wonderful things about this book that I purchased for my Father. Haven't heard how he likes it yet. Looks very interesting.
5,Why don't you find out for yourself?,"The decline of human capital ...This should be neither right nor left ... Democratic nor Republican ...But like a moth to the light, many will jump on ""neo-con this and neo-con that ... ""Just because Mr. Steyn believes that the decline of human capital is as important global warming, he is quickly dismissed for political reasons. Sad and troubling.There is TRUTH in this book.Birth rates, demographics, self-extinction ...""the modern world expires in favor of backward tribes...""What I am hearing is numbers ... the math ... do it.""Then you'll see the glass hidden in the grass""-Stephen Morrissey, writer of the song...uhm, not the Killers :)"
2,A Tough Read for Me,"Mike Evans spent too much time in the book's beginning telling me I had to go to church twice a week or the world as we know it would end. The last half was interesting and enlightning but I almost put it down before I got there. Not Mr. Evans best work, ""Showdown With Nuclear Iran"" was much better."
4,An Important Read,"In America Alone, Mark Steyn argues that the West is threatened by the undercurrent of Islamic takeover. The terrorist homicide bombings, beheadings, bombing of buildings, and general slaughter are the headline grabbers of their goals. But Steyn argues that the biggest threat to the West is not a military or forceful takeover, but rather our downfall would be from within. Low fertility rates, lenient multicultural attitudes, the lack of assimilation, liberal social programs (socialism in general), and naivete all contribute to the possible downfall of the free Western World. Let's hope Steyn's doomsday scenario fails to come to fulfillment and that America will not be alone in the days ahead. An important read!"
5,A peek at our near future,"An analysis of 2005 birth rates and how they impact the future of Western countries, and much more as only Mark Steyn can explain; this man is a near genius with a wonderful sense of humor. It is the most important book I have ever read."
5,America Alone by Mark Steyn,"No time to go wobbly.(books, arts & manners)(America Alone: The End of the World As We Know It, by Mark Steyn)(Book review): An article from: National ReviewAn excellent read. If only the libs would realize what it is saying."
5,Factual and funy,Very well written. I enjoyed it heaps because there are some good evidence to back up the rationale of the author. It is written in a light text with a lot of humor.
3,america alone,"If you are looking for a horror story in non-fiction this is it. Mark Steyn goes about putting fear into people and we can see there is truth to his claims, as much of what he is predicting has already come to pass. Unfortunately we never learn from history.It is a well written book as he uses alot of humour to take the edge of some of his frightening observations."
3,kenfordboisereview,"The sections on Demographic population numbers for major nationsof the world are the heart of this book. The editorial commentsregarding by the author of the culture wars on going in publicdiscourse are however disjointed and much of the time merelyanecdotal. They provide little guidance for further and moreformal research on the sources of national power and economicgrowth.The writer has an obvious preference for the American way of life,but provides little historical context as to how the American worldview got to be so different from the other developed nations of theworld."
5,Awesome Book!- This Author Knows his Stuff- Death to Al-Qaeda & God Bless America!,"This is a fantastic read for any common sense- good hearted- regular person who is concerned about the danger of Militant Islam and lack of resolve to defend western civilization from the left wing secular progressive socialist wimps in Europe (and here in the US too).These people need to have their heads examined, Militant Islam is a real danger to this world, and Al-Qaeda needs to be destroyed ASAP.Only one force on Earth can defeat Al-Qaeda, and bring some kind of hope- justice- and freedom for this world, and that force is the United States of America (Hopefully with Great Britain on our side right next to us as we wipe these nasty monsters out like we did during WW2 with Hitler)Its time for the west to wake the heck up, and take a strong moral- ethical, and military stand against these terrorist barbarians.Death to Al-Qaeda, and may God bless America."
5,Wake-Up Call Or Epitaph?,"In ""America Alone"" author Mark Steyn has written what will come to be regarded as either America's wake-up call or its epitaph. I hope it's the former, but I fear it's the latter. A ""must read"" for any thinking American. I couldn't put it down."
5,3 most important things,"Steyn makes perfectly clear that there are 3 most important things that govern the future of mankind, and it's not climate. It's demographics, demographics, demographics........ An inconvenient truth."
5,Sobering Truth,"Sharia Law is seeping into the round of daily life. Taxi drivers, Target cashiers, self censorship by the mainstream media. This book illuminates what is and what is to come. It is a devastating indictment of political correctness."
4,A Look at the Future,This book gives warning that America will be alone as the only non Muslim western nation in a few decades. The author notes the low fertility rates in countries such as Germany and France while pointing out the increase in Muslims by both birth and conversion. The use of his sense of humor and witty sarcasm makes interesting reading
2,Product Description is not very accurate,"After doing research at Canon's website, Canon says this product number is the direct interface cable for USB connection to a PC. When the product arrived, although it is marked with the product ID number I was expecting, there was obviously no USB connector on the end of it. Looking at the cable, I can see that it connects to the camera, but I cannot identify what kind of device connects to the other end of it - it is a very strange and fairly large connector - not USB for sure!"
1,Waste of $$$$,"What a disappointment, saw him in Dave Attell's Insomniac Tour video (outstanding performance), so I thought I'd check out his other material - very disappointed in this one!! Waste of $$$ and time I'll never get back. Oh well, every time I watch him on Dave Attell's video, I cry I laugh so hard!!"
5,So funnnny,"Love this album. Some people argue that isn't great because of lack of bonus features but I still think the DVD is completely worth it. His jokes are great and the execution is awesome. Like one of the other reviews said, check it out you will laugh your ass off."
5,Very funny man!,"Greg Giraldo was an incredibly funny man and always enjoyed his work on the roasts and also his stand-up. He will be missed, any Greg fan needs to check this out. Good stuff."
4,Funny....Funnier Still in Retrospect,"Some of his political stuff went from being goofy when he performed it to actually topical as I watch it now.How about this:Obama said he had to make a deal with his wife to stop smoking so she would let him run for president.GG: If that were true then how could he possibly negotiate with rogue nations, etc. etc.LMAO"
1,piece of crap,plastic is broke an i cant install it right now so now i have to order a new on just so i can install my stereo the right way thanks for a piece of junk
4,shenanigans,"Good stuff. Does what you want it to do. It is cheap plastic, but do you really need more for this kind of thing? Installation is easy, the screws don't thread very easy but you just have to work at it. Also, the box sits further back than you think when you try to install it."
5,Great Faucet!,This faucet works great. The installation was easy. All the items needed to attach the reverse osmosis water line and the fixture to my granite counter top were included. There is a rubber seal under the base to prevent any water from the counter top entering below the fixture. The knob turns 1/4 of a turn from 9 o'clock to 6 o'clock to turn on. I really like this faucet!
3,Water Filtration,"I was very happy to find this faucet as the options are slim in the oil rubbed bronze at a reasonable price. This faucet is very attractive. I was building a new house and it was shipped to my builder within a week of ordering.I've always had a water filtration faucet at the sink. This particular faucet does not seem to have the water flow or water pressure that I'm used to, although it is adequate. It just takes a little longer to fill a glass or coffee cup."
4,Good foundational principles,"In a time where christianity has been loaded down with so many man made rituals and repetitive practices, Myles Munroe's book, Rediscovering the kingdom, peels away the layers of these rituals and side docterines to reveal the true message of christianity. That message is that we can live powerfully because the curse has been removed. We don't have take our lumps and then say, ""well that's life."" Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil and give us life to the full! It's our job to forcefully take a hold of the kingdom!"
5,Rediscovering the Kingdom,This reading is one for the ages. I found myself going back and rereading sections as I tried to continue with the book. It is a compilation of ideas backed by scripture that when you read them you are bound to start thinking. It is a wonderful book and I purchased a few copies to share with my Brothers and Sisters of my church. I highly recommend this book for all who are in search of some very realistic answers to todays world.
5,Rediscovering The Kingdom,"This book was my introduction to Myles Munroe. He has a style of his own which makes it an easy read. The book is anything but easy. Deep, profound, thought provoking and definately revelation word is how I would define this book!"
4,the kingdom,This book is wonderful and breaks down the principles of the kingdom in laymen's terms. I have not read Munroe's previous book on the Kingdom but will be buying it shortly. I would recommend buying both books at the same time
1,"Works well, when it's not locking my iPod","This thing records well. I can put it in the floor in the middle of a circle of students about 10ft in diameter and have a recording good enough to grade them from. However, it doesn't always work. It tends to lock up my iPod and require me to do a reset. It locked my iPod today, and the 'pod won't reset. So I have to send the iPod back to Apple. This is with a carefully updated and maintained iPod. I've written to Griffin about the lock-up problem and have received no reply after six weeks."
2,Griffin dung,"While it worked, I loved it. For recording personal memos it was great. Unfortunately the record button broke within two months, so it has no longevity."
2,ipod does not detect this device very well,I found this recorder hard to use ! I have to stick this device on to my ipod (3rd generation) ten times to get it to work. I also found that if the ipod is connected to power supply then this recorder can be recognized more easily than without. My ipod sometimes became weird after connecting with this recorder. I have this recorder for over one year and I hardly use it just because I can not get it to work. I would not recommend it!
1,Terrible...,This is the second Griffin product I bought for my iPod that I think is just plain garbage. The first was the FM transmitter which performed poorly in Chicago area.The iTalk is just as bad. The microphone has awful pickup and the recorded sound is pratically unintelligble... Don't waste your money on this. If you need a voice recoder I would try a different brand...Worthless.
1,Updated my review,Love the airplay. Works great and easy to use. Didn't have to install any software-it's just a plug in and enjoy. Very nice-not as much static. Great!
2,Old... ?????,"I was looking forward to this product. However, it was not new as I think it was supposed to be. It appeared to be old and had scratches on it. I do not suppose that this would have been the case if I had bought the same product from the store itself."
1,Weak effort from a great company,"Out of the box, my iTalk would not record, giving me a ""Microphone is not attached"" error. When I was able to get it to record about one out of every fifteen times, it did so at half the bitrate that the iPod is capable of.I would be a little nicer to a product that was not given the good graces of Apple (Griffin is essentially a child company of Apple, and they added the firmware to use the iTalk within the standard iPod firmware.) Given all of that, I would have to say that the shoddy construction, bad software, and intentional crippling makes this not worth the price."
4,Works well,"I have used the voice recorder and, for the most part, it works well. It does not have great sensitivity. I had the old model (my son broke it) and got the new model. The new one has improvements which include a button ON the mic itself to start the recording. This feature is very nice. Additionally, they have bolstered the electrical prongs, which prevent a 2 1/2 year old from breaking them off."
1,Bug-Randomly switches to Recording Mode&No Support,"iTalk plugs into the iPod very nicely, and the concept is great.The bug I found was that in the middle of playing a playlist of songs using the speaker, the iTalk randomly switches over to recording mode from play mode. There is no setting to change this.I checked the manual for help (it is just a 7 pages in total and no valuable info, just a namesake manual).I checked the FAQ, which is just 3 questions in total and my issue is not covered there.So then I looked all over the Griffin website for a telephone number or email to contact the support, there is nothing of the sort.So here I am left with a faulty device. Therefore I would not reccommend this device."
2,Just plain bad...,"This is okay as long as you don't need decent quality recordings, but if you expect ANY level of audio quality, look elsewhere. The volume of the voice memos is so terribly low that even at full playback volume, I have to strain to hear them. I read another review that said the iTalk picks up sounds clearly from across a large room, but nothing could be further from the truth. Unless you hold your iPod directly up to what you want to record, it picks up virtually nothing. The external mic jack is nice, but if I plug my headphones into it, the playback quality is dreadful even on existing songs & whatnot. There is excessive hissing and background noise on each recording too, and the sound volume is erratic. Even it I record via Line-in, it still snaps, crackles & pops till the cows come home.Bottom line- it's just really bad. Save your money."
3,"OK, but durability not its strong point","I had the first generation iTalk and I'm not sure if it's improved, so take this as my experience only. I did some interviews and was quite happy with the sound quality. However, inexplicably, the microphone stopped working at one stage and though it showed that it was recording, no sound actually went into the file. I don't remember dropping it though I am not the most careful person with my electronics. Anyway, I lost a couple of one-time interviews and am now looking for something more reliable.One thing that would really help is a level meter on the ipod so you could tell what the ipod thought it was recording."
1,Works from time to time !!!,"The problem is that when it ""records"" you don't know if it teally does.You only learn later ( when playing the ""recorded audio"" ) that it did not record ( or it did record ) and this is no good ( waisted time ).I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Killed my iPod,"It cooked my iPod Classic. Apparently it really doesn't like anything other than 5th Gen iPods.A Best Buy representative sold me an iTalk Pro and an 80GB iPod Classic as a way to record my DJ mixes and music made on my drum machine. It never worked right, and eventually committed seppuku. First, my recordings would be either too low to hear, so loud that clipping occurred every other second, or filled with noise. A direct line recording from my line out would be stuttered and useless. I never got a good recording from this device. Both the microphone and line in jack would record at the same time, filling my clean line recordings with noise from the mic. Finally, after just a few days, the iPod borked out. When I took it back to Best Buy, it was still clicking and flashing. It wouldn't even respond to a hard reset.Beware this product. It killed my iPod."
1,bad deal,"this italk doesn't work! it worked for about a minute, and since then, the ipod either won't record because it states that there is no microphone or it claims to record and you don't hear anything. don't bother."
1,Ok as a Close-out item for $9.99,I got this as a closeout for $9.99. That's all it's worth.More of a toy than a serious digital voice recorder.They need to put a little quality in the microphone.
2,good idea not so good product,as far as using the ipod as a recorder I think an actual digital recorder would get better sound. The italk picks up all ambient sound. I have even used it with an external mic and still not wowed with the clarity.
1,save your money,this 50 dollar (after taxes s/h etc...) piece of cheap garbage is a big waist of money. distorts even if just recording your own voice talking. griffen advertises that you can use this product to record song ideas. tried that. all i hear is a muffled distorted version of what i played. the sounds quality is horrible. i get better quality recordings on my pocked pc's built in mic. bottom line.... DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!! you will feel ripped off... i certainly do. i'd give the iTalk negative stars if i could.
2,When it works...,"I've had some success with the iTalk, but much more frequently run into failures... undated & corrupted recordings, cannot playback recordings, etc.I have put this through the ringer at many a lunch meeting & would not recommend this product. You will regret missing the action items from THE meeting that you had to capture when this thing lets you down... and it will."
2,italk voice recorder,"The italk recorder works best within 12"". The microphone isn't very sensitive. The recorder actually begins recording, 2 seconds after the red light comes on. Forget about what the manufacturer claims about using the italk as a speaker for audiobooks, you would have to hold the ipod up to your ear to use it. The recorder is just a recorder, and is only a fair recorder."
1,Not for 5th Generation Ipod,I sent this back for a refund because it does not hook up with 5th generation iPod..
3,Fine For Voice Memos,"Was planning to write a long review but traveller-on-walkabout below nailed 90% of my comments. Bottom line. This is a passable product for low-quality voice memos. If you plan to use it for anything more you will likely be disappointed.One more thing, I found that there is a rather long -- 4-5 second -- delay from when the device claims to be recording vs. when it actaully starts doing so. Have not seen that noted elsewhere so I'll assume it's a glich in my device."
4,"Oldy, but works for me","This is an old item. But, it works for me with the reasons below;1. easy to use2. decent sound quality3. easy to transfer a recorded file"
5,A Great Device,"It worked like magic for me, clear recording and very easy to use. It's just what I needed"
1,Won't work with nano,"Despite Amazon's product description that indicated this product would work with the i-pod nano, it will not."
5,Ducane Grill Igniter,This is the second electrode I have ordered and this one went down in price. A pleasant surprise. Fits the Ducane exactly as the original and works great.
5,Thought they were a pain alive you're in for a real shock!,"It's Ravenloft at it's finest and undead at it's prime. What could be worse than fighting against Ravenloft's custom undead creaters that stalk the night, haunt the forests, and hunt the living? Ravenloft answer making those undead stronger and giving you the ability to make your own Ravenloft undead monsters. This can be achieved through this book it gives you a comprehensive list of abilities, powers, and appearances that you can give to any character. So if you had a really nasty villian that you loved and your players recall with infamany you can bring em' back to the land of the living to scare the crap of them one more time in ways they would never see coming. I would recommend this book to any self respected horror fan, Ravenloft fan, and anyone gamer that wants a second chance at their players with their favorite villian."
2,Drip drip...,"The plastic connection did not properly seal, Had to go purchase the higher quality brass fittings from Home Depot which sells a better quality kit made by Watts."
1,Leaked,It leaked after I had it installed. Had to go buy a better quality product to replace it. Don't waste you time since you'll end up replacing it later.
3,Beautifully written portrait of an idiot,"I don't think I've been this annoyed by a main character since ""The Catcher in the Rye."" Werther is probably one of the most irritating, whiney characters in the history of literature. I never once felt an ounce of pity for this obsessive, creepy guy, and I can understand completely why the girl pushes him away. A very unattractive personality, and I don't know what was going on at the time to make readers swoon for his ""sorrows."" I kept waiting for him to finally shoot himself, and when he did my feeling was, ""thank god."" That said, it is superbly written, and it does belong in any list of classic books. Even though the writing is beautiful, I still could not care about Werther, and I hope that today's readers aren't inspired to glory in self-pity the way Werther does."
2,ok translation. not a good one.,The translation is a bit of odd. I can't feel the rythm of Goethe's masterpiece.
2,The Sorrows of the Reader,"Okay, I'm going to be the turd in the punchbowl here and say, ""What on earth did everyone like so much about this book?"" For a short book, this felt like it lasted forever. It was drawn out and boring. It is about a young man who is obsessed with a married woman. Werther is whiny and unlikeable in my opinoin. The book is a collection of letters he has written to his friend. The letters consist of his bellyaching about his unrequited love. I found Werther to be irritating and was quite apathetic to his plight. Thumbs down. I do not recommend this book, but apparently many others do."
3,A Treatise on Narcissismus,"It takes a Goethe to produce a well-written presentation of such treacly-dense narcissism on paper. He does, and it is worth reading solely for that reason."
5,Vanessa from Singapore,"The book was my introduction to Goethe, and it is one of the most beautiful books i have read for awhile. The depression Werther feels, against the world, and Lotte just touches the soul. An emotionally charged book, definitely one to read."
2,Marred by poor OCR,"I bought the Penguin-branded Kindle eBook, paying a premium over the other, cheaper editions, and got exactly what I feared from a cheap product: poor typesetting (it's not clear where blockquotes begin and end), frequent errors in the OCR (""diick"" instead of ""duck"", ""litde"" instead of ""little""), and no table of contents whatsoever.The text is readable, if requiring of some riddle-solving (Oh, ""sympadiy"" is ""sympathy""), and has the obligatory footnoting from the print version (most of which are mere cross-references than actual, helpful notes). I don't know what the cheaper editions are like, but I'd take the risk next time, since the Penguin brand apparently means nothing in Kindle books."
5,Giant literature read with a tiny effort.,"This was a great book which introduced me to Goethe. It is very sad but quite intriguing, and Goethe presents his own problems in this somewhat non-ficiton book. Even when Lotte showed that she cared for him, Werther knew that she could never love him fully and since his love for her replaced life, but the love was unrequited, there was no reason to live. I wasn't able to relate to it as much as others seemed to, but it will still wonderfully written. Now Goethe is one of my favorites. Read Faust, too!"
5,"A book about Nature, Social norms and certainty",When reading The Sorrows of Young Werther for the first time I was very impressed. At the beginning of the novel I could detect the depression with Werther. This depression was not only the love of Lotte but depression of life as a whole. He appeared to be a lonely man who craved for someone to love him. In some ways I disliked Werther. I felt like saying to him to pull himself together and get on with his own life and stop running after something which has already been caught by someone else.
5,Loving Someone Too Much Can Be Fatal,"This is one of my favourite books. I can definitely relate to loving people too much, so I understand what Alfred (I hope it's the right name 'cause I haven't read the book in a long time) is going through. It's a great story of love with a tragic ending. Don't do what the protagonist did 'cause there's plenty of fish in the sea."
3,A Bit Disappointing,"I really wanted to love this book. I enjoyed reading Goethe's Italian Journey and I've read so many flattering things about Young Werther that I've looked forward for some time to the experience of finally reading it. Unfortunately, it just didn't grab me.The positives include Goethe's poetic descriptions of nature and the powerful imagery they evoke and the frequently beautiful language with which Werther depicted his obsession with Lotte.The primary problems I had with the work were the repetitiveness of Werther's self-pitying missives and a certain incredulity I could not shake relative to the foundations of his compulsion. In the final analysis, a persistent feeling that Werther was silly and unjustified in his fixation and self-indulgent in wallowing in his misery dulled the impact of his fate on my senses substantially.I am hoping for better things from Faust..."
2,I don't get it,I must be missing something. Werther has no drama or plot to speak of. Reading it was like reading my own journals -- (...). Someone please tell me what I'm missing.
1,The Insanity of Werther,"My friend Jordie and I have read The Sorrows of Young Werther as well as several reviews of the novel and we have come to a single conclusion: He's mentally unstable. We find that it is NOT A TRAGIC LOVE STORY, but rather a story of a depressed, diluted individual completely disconnected from reality. Werther is too full his own virtue and cannot grasp the reality of his relationship to Charlotte. Werther's reaction to the events of his life are too emotional and over-dramatized. As we would say in German, ER IST VERRUECKT!!"
5,Far Better Than I Anticipated,"I received this book as a gift some years ago, and never bothered reading it as I assumed that based on the subject matter it would be too depressing - far from it!True, it does have an extremely dark ending, but what I didn't expect would be all of Goethe's insights into life and living as told through Werther's letters to his friend.And nearly all of Michael Hulse's footnotes in this edition are also worth reading. They add either important historical context (after all, the book is hundreds of years old) or insights into Goethe and the novel itself.I was pleasantly surprised by this easy read. I don't know if I would recommend it to someone who is unstable or who has contemplated suicide, but what man hasn't suffered a broken heart or unrequited love at some time or another? All these centuries later, this book is still relevant and an engaging read."
5,The Difference Between Rosseau and Goethe,"Werther iscompletely filled with poetic romantism,that allow us to enter into the intimacy of the German bourgeoisie.Other than that,it's a romance of love,better yet,the romance of the wish to love.Goethe shows us through this epistolary monologue,the abtruse secrets of the heart and the reactions that,untill than,had never been analyzed.And last,the cult of nature.This cult is very different from the one from Rosseau: In the contemplation of Nature,the sentiments of Werther find infinite and preturbing ressonances.Unsuitable for chardiacs! ;)"
2,Too much,"The ideals and romanticism of Werther are so exaggerated that they're almost unbelievable. I thought Britain's 19th century Romantics were emotional . . . Goethe, in 1774, is 'worse'! I could not sympathize with Werther in the least; he was quite annoying with his incessant tears and sighs. Werther seems to me merely a kamakazi-like lover who opts a coward's end. Also, _The Sorrows of Young Werther_ denies the reader a full portrait of characters like Wilhem, Lotte, and big-man Werther himself. A quite disappointing novella for me."
3,Emotional Literature,"This book was a groundbreaking work of romanticism. Feelings, moods, and nature pretty much set the tone for all the action of the book. The story is sad and the hero pathetic, but we care for him. This book is an important assertion of irrationalism in both life and art, and the role of poetry in human reasoning. This is probably a good introduction to Goethe and one of the major phases in the evolution of the novel's form."
5,The greatest love story ever written,"As I said on the title, compared to Werther, Romeo and Juliet is a simple boring theatre piece. The second greatest book I've ever read. If you don't like this book, you are short-minded or too bored of life. Every letter gives you an emotion, IT IS REALLY WORTH IT."
4,Great Buy!,"I bought this watch as an anniversary gift for my husband (who is very particular about his watches) and he actually thought it was a very nice looking watch with all the right features! I love the look and the fact that it's an eco-watch so no more batteries. The only downfall if you call it that is that it takes some time to set the watch and it has to be done in a specific order...the directions are easy to follow, though."
5,"Hot Mixtape From The Game, Sign Of More Great Things To Come..","Game shows these rap suckas how it should be done on this mixtape, he buries competition track after track like a real mc does, can't wait till ""Doctor's Advocate"" drops"
5,stop the hate,"I THINK ITS A GOOD CD. I DONT KNOW WHY PEOPLE THINK HE NEED 50 CENT. 50 CENT PUT OUT ONE GOOD CD NOW HE THINK HES ON TOP,NOTTT! ALL HE DOES IS DISS JARULE ON EVERY SONG AND RAP ABOUT THE SAME S**T ON EVERY RECORD,TUPAC WANNABE. 50 CENT IS OVER."
4,good listen,"this is games ghost unit mixtape,still a good listen,but not 1 of his better ones,with his name dropping skills in full effect game goes on about dissing all of the g-unit crew,still a ok album thats worth buying,but nothing inovative here"
2,a great rapper but not a good cd,The game is 1 of the best right now n lots of love for him but this cd was not good. The songs were pretty crappy n not 2 great. He has all the right 2 dis 50 cause 50 is a wanna b thug. The first mixtape was alot better n the documentary was good 2. Game has great lyrics in alomst all his songs n cds but not this 1. Game has tons of potiental n is usin it but not in this cd. so get his other cds were game is beeter cause i think he ran out of disses for 50 n his wanna b clan.
1,Don't Buy it!,This vision/interpretation of the beloved Fantasticks is a complete travesty. They've managed to ruin not only the dialog but the music as well. I foolishly ordered the DVD before viewing it. I have since donated it to my local library because that choice marginally outweighed the waste of throwing it in the trash.
1,The Fantasticks movie version,"This is a terrible version of the well known OFF BROADWAY production. The simplicity of the stage production which invites the audience to 'remember, then follow' is completely destroyed by the inexplicable transformation of the characters of El Gallo, The Mute, Mortimer and Henry to performers in a traving circus side show. There are also changes to the music, in an attempt to be 'politically correct', which insult the intelligence of the theater going audience.The copy that I received is flawed and freezes irratically necessitating fast forwarding to the next 'chapter'."
3,Cute But Not The Stage Show,"The movie is definitely not the stage show. It had potential in the beginning and then fell flat on it's face. Leaving out the song ""Plant A Radish"" and changing the ""Rape Ballet"" to ""Abduction"" is an insult to the musical. ""Try To Remember"", one of the most memorable songs in musical theater, is hardly given a nod. I was not too disappointed with the movie, but felt that it deserved much more than it delivered. Much more..."
1,My Nominee for worst movie musical of all time.,A complete and utter stinker. Totally lacking in charm. This show has only one good song: Try to Remember. The other songs are the worst show tunes you will ever hear. The clue should be titles like Plant A Radish and The Rape Song. The cast is dismal. Joe McIntyre has no appeal whatsoever. Where did they dig up this guy? I hope to NEVER see him again. There really isn't a plot: two fathers pretend to have a feud so that their children will get together romantically. The children get together but immediately begin fighting. Something vague happens to them and they wind up together. Huh? Boring! It is sad to see a talented performer like Joel Grey completely wasted in a production this pathetic. The Arizona scenery is kind of nice. Avoid this one like the plague.P. S. This one deserves NO STARS!
2,NOT FANTASTICK...,"While Michael Ritchie and friends obviously were looking to retain the sweet simplicity of the classic stage play by placing this fable in the open mid-West, with its pure vistas and uncluttered focus, this movie is often terrible. None of the actors are able to convey, through the book or the music, which is badly sung, the magical feeling of the stage show. Nor do they have the empathetic qualities they need. And this musical, which is propelled at all times by its lush, complex and near-perfect musical score and its poignant lyrics, is done a great disservice by the fact that virtually every number has been reorchestrated, cut, butchered and staged in an almost manic look that renders them unintentionally funny when they aren't merely distracting. Run to New York and see the charming little show, which I guarantee will be better sung, full of heart and wistful in all the right places."
2,Gone Awry,"I guess this is another example of how somebody tries to ""improve"" a classic broadway show. I had hoped the movie would capture the warmth and simplicity that I remember from the stage show, but it didn't. On the positive side, the vocals by Louisa and Matt were excellent. Joe McIntyre, in fact, gave a first-rate performance. But Joel Grey and Bernard Hughes were wasted, their parts turned into mere drop-ins. El Gallo was no longer a narrator and storyteller, but a sleazy Casanova. Too bad; ""The Fantasticks"" deserved much better."
1,Barely Evokes the theatrical mastery of its namesake.,"I saw this video a few weeks ago and I was astonished. Of course, being a fan of the musical, I should have realized that THE FANTASTICKS is not a property suited to film adaptation. Everything charming and adorable about the Off-Broadway show--that still charms after so many years--has been pushed to the side so that the directors ""concept""--oh so reminiscent of ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD--may take centerstage. The power of the stage show comes from the actors talking to the audience and inviting the audience into their own little world. On film, that world is thrown at us muddled and uninteresting. And the characters are reconceived! Oh, the horror. Trust me, if you are a fan of the stage show, do not waste your time here. If you have never seen the show and wish to be initiated, it is a toss-up, I guess, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone with taste."
2,"Not ""Fantastick"" in the theatre, either","In response to Mr. Haas' review, I saw THE FANTASTICKS in the theatre, and it was no great treat there, either. The idea of setting an extremely intimate in the middle of the prairie, thereby robbing it of its intimacy, is absurd. The script has been completely overhauled, losing its poetry and rhythms. The score has also been slashed, dropping verses and songs (the Fathers' PLANT A RADISH going by the way; a rewrite of lyrics for METAPHOR that manage to drop the metaphors altogether) with abandon. The best parts are Jonathan Tunick's marvelous orchestrations, Joel Gray, and Teller's death scene. All else is faintly embarassing."
3,The Fantasticks - a delightful coming of age story,"The movie wasn't as enjoyable as I'd expected. However I've seen this performed live by school theatre departments and I absolutely loved those performances. Very surprisingly I saw a traveling broadway performance staring (the gorgeous)Robert Goulet, and I didn't enjoy his performance nearly as much as the high school performances. What can I say? :)"
4,A cottom candy romance of a musical,"This film seems to have never found an audience.I think it may have been the casting of Jean Louisa Kellyin the lead role. Although she is beautiful and talented,that is an acquired taste by those who know her work.The almost too slick stagging would have learned something fromthe musical ""Oklahoma"" in depicting the Midwestern American community.The carnival never has an carnival ""feel"" to itthat it should have had like in ""State Fair"".In this case failure may not have been a learning experience?"
4,"Not the play, but good","Although the movie has a different feel than the play...and trys to drag more realism into this story than there should really be, its still totally worthwhile. The overall story of the play is timeless and the movie captures it beautifully. Also the songs are so amazing and i love Joey from new kids as Matt, the boy!! If you love this play i'd recomned seeing this movie- just dont expect a carbon copy of the stage show and u wont be dissapointed."
4,The Fantasticks,"This film manages to retain much of the special feel of the stage production. The many layers of the story may be lost on those who are younger. You see more of the depth looking back from ""deep in December"". I would have rated it 5 stars if they had only been able to retain the complete, original musical score, and kept ""The Wall"" in as part of the cast."
2,Eh...,"Pretty good material. The performances here look and sound pretty good, but give you little to love. Superficial. Go find it on a stage, and hope the performances reach beyond camp."
2,Ultimate Primer on how NOT to bring a classic to the screen,"The Fantasticks strength is in the intimate and very theatrical presentation. With a small band and a small house it is at its best. However, when making the move to the screen almost all of what made The Fantasticks the longest running musical is lacking. It is unfortunate, for the location and house sets are almost perfect for the show. But the characterizations are skewed and lacking, and changes made for this movie almost always moves it away from the charming stage classic.Musical numbers are eliminated, and the shows best known song, Try to Remember, is included briefly at the end as an afterthought that it had to be represented.There are some things that work here, and if you have not seen the show you may even enjoy it. But don't expect The Fantasticks that launched a young Jerry Orbach on a long career."
4,Missing Song,"I wonder why the song the fathers sang in the stageplay .... ""plant a cabbage, get a cabbage..."" was deleted from the video. It was one of my favorite parts and I have seen it on stage five times."
5,Beguiling,"That MGM/UA chose to ignore this treasure still astounds me. I saw it in Los Angeles twice and could not wait to buy the DVD. I only wish a CD was available. Oddly, I was never a huge fan of the play, and never would have dreamed it possible that it could be translated to film. The slight story and broad theatrics have been adapted with amazing subtlety and simplicity combined with breathtakingly gorgeous orchestrations by the great Johnathan Tunick, who has done a lot of great work for Sondheim. The cast succeeds beyond all expectations; especially successful are Jean Louisa Kelly and Joe McIntyre, who play off one another charmingly.I was puzzled by some of the stinging reviews this film got when it was finally released. I suspect those same people dislike The Sound of Music, Oklahoma! and the musical form in general. Bottom line, if you enjoy musicals, chances are you will find much to enjoy in this."
2,Fantasticks butchered,"Other reviewers give essential information on the editing of this film. Here's my review: Coppola butchered the thing. The narrative has been stripped of any sub plots, any minor characters, any scenes that would flesh out these few characters and their story. The two lovers acquire the needed hardship to make their love meaningful in so few minutes it's difficult to see before and after differences. After seeing the thing straight through, I went to the deleted scenes and watched each one; many were very short; all were needed. Deleted and shortened songs: unforgivable. Yes, the cinematography is beautiful, casting works, etc. Someone needs to get control of the original of this film and restore its guts."
2,Bad editing,"Release the movie the way the director originally filmed it in 1995, instead of the chopped up version finally released on dvd."
2,"However enchanting, rather confusing","I have heard glowing reviews about live performances of The Fantasticks, yet when I saw the DVD, I couldn't see the true magic. I suppose you have to see it on a live stage to actually have a thrill, otherwise, I'd never look at it. The movie version must have lost some sparkle in the transfer to the screen. I suggest you see the musical live (which I have never done), and if you truly enjoy it, try the movie. Don't buy the movie and then go see a live show."
3,The Fantastics,I think the movie lost some of the essential intemacy so critical to the plot - but still it is a good place holder for people who did not have the chance to see the show
5,Wonderful Coming of Age Story(ies) in the Tiffany Aching Series,"What a delight. This is a great story with lots of metaphors that symbolize the birth, coming-of-age, and life transitions not only for Tiffany, but the other young witches in training, as well as Roland the baron's son and the Feegles (in particular, Rob Anybody). In true Pratchett style and humor, the author manages to pull the reader in for remarkable entertainment and read about characters who are developed in even more detail than before. Granny and Nanny Ogg make strong appearances here (though Agnes is missing) and have you rolling with laughter with their sage advice."
3,The Wee Kids,"Most of Pratchett's books have an adult component that is really entertaining. The Wee series not so much. It is an enjoyable romp but kinda loses fantasy creds at the end. Not to say I didn't enjoy it, but his main series on witches is much better"
5,great,"Just finished this book. Sure the Tiffany Aching books are supposed to be for a younger audience but that doesn't stop the story or characters from being great. Pratchett is the only person so far that I've found that can make a young protaganist that I actually like (normally I despise them in any medium).While the books are generally supposed to be able to be read stand alone I think it does the story a great injustice if you don't know the earlier books with Tiffany and the ""normal"" discworld books with the other witches.I have yet to find a Prachett book that I don't like and I feel they are getting better with time."
3,Thoughts on Wintersmith,"I found Wintersmith to be not as engaging as the other Tiffany Aching books, but picks up with an excellent ending."
3,A big sub-par for Pratchett,"I've been an avid reader of Terry Pratchett's work for years, and always find his Discworld series amazing. But, I just feel that this story came up a bit short. His best characters had minor roles, the story was lacking a bit in substance and his ending was very rushed."
5,Tiffany Aching Conquers All,"This is the third Tiffany Aching novel. It is my favorite of the three, though Wee Free Men and A Hat Full of Sky were both great reads. As the father of a daughter about Tiffany's age, I was delighted to find a story in which the female protaganist is bright, resourceful and stands at the beginning of her teenage years. It is a story that all young women should be encouraged to read. The Nac Mac Feegles, Granny Weatherwax and other witches all participate in getting things sorted out when Winter takes a fancy for Tiffany."
5,Lovely Read,"Pratchett fans, don't let the notion that this is geared toward a younger audience deter you... if you enjoyed ""Hat Full of Sky"" and ""Wee Free Men"" you'll enjoy this, too."
4,Such a fun story!,"Admittedly not as good as the last Wee Free Men book, but that would be had to do! This is a series that has split the sides of all ages in our family! Everyone insists on reading it together, and heaven help the person that reads ahead!"
4,A fun tale of derring do,"What can I say about the writing of Terry Pratchett? If you haven't already discovered his books, do yourself a favor, start now. They are a laugh-a-minute and you generally find you are laughing at yourself, your friends, the government and your stuffy ideas.An excellent story, opening a whole new vista in your mind, suitable for readers 10 yrs to 100yrs; AND guaranteed to get you out of a bad mood."
4,A great series. Not the best in it though,"Tiffany Aching is one of the great characters in the Terry Pratchett pantheon. While everybody around her is off in that delightful Pratchett kind of way, she is incredibly normal: though she is a witch, and does the most extraordinary things. It's her practicality and intelligence that get her through. She has to be one of the great female characters in young adult literature, though for the life of me, except for the fact of her age, I have no idea why this is considered young adult writing. The series is as brilliant and funny as any of Pratchett's other discworld books: incisive and smart. Unfortunately, this is not quite as funny as the previous two books in the series, but still a very enjoyable read. I look forward to Tiffany's next adventure."
3,Young Adult novel left me feeling chilly,"I adore Terry Pratchett, and all things to do with his witches, but I'm not 13 years-old anymore (the target audience for this book). Young Tiffany Aching lacks something that I look for in my Pratchett characters, so I found it difficult to care about what happens to her. Luckily Pratchett's supporting cast (the Wee Free Men, Nanny Ogg, and Granny Weatherwax, to name a few) more than make up for her lackluster self. The conflict with the Wintersmith is fairly simple and seems to only exist in order to bookend the story. The real focus of the book seems to be teenage drama between Tiffany and another young rival witch from the other side of the mountain. If your a 13-year-old girl this might be a good place to start your love affair with Pratchett, if you aren't look elsewhere for your satire fix."
4,Great Basic Phone,"I bought this phone to have as a back up for when power goes out. So obviously it doesn't require power to operate. It has no bells or whistles. No caller ID, no message waiting light, and so on.For the price you can't beat it. My only grip is the ring tone is horrible. It's a ""chirp"" sound and it scares my cat!I highly recommend this phone to anyone that wants a plain basic phone. Something rare these days."
4,Panasonic Corded Telephone,Basic phone with minimal features. Handset is a little light and is not so easy to hang up when wall mounted. Could be a little smaller. Bought as a replacement for the basic Sony corded phone which has a better feel but is no longer available.
4,Great durable phone,"I use this phone in my office and it is very durable and has a stylish design. Buttons are rubber like and help for grip when pressing. Calls are clear. The only ""cons"" would be that the volume at the lowest is still a little louder then I would prefer and there is no mute button. No batteries required is good too."
5,just fantastic,"It's just a phone, nothing more but nothing less. I use it with a bluetooth adapter to place and receive calls from my blackberry while in my office, and for this it works wonderfully as i can still see caller ID info on my blackberry screen.would work well for a backup home phone or desk phone also.sound quality is as good as you can get on a phone."
4,Corded Phone,I have been using it & it is a great phone for it`s price I would recomend it to anyone.
5,Panasonix KX-TS500B,Cheaper than anything on the display shelves at RadioShack and/or RiteAid.It works. You speak to someone on the telephone. Telephoning is a not a wayof life. Who the hell needs a cell telephone to begin with unless you are asales representative?Got computers. Got 3D TVs.Twitter is useless and so are smart telephones.
4,Good Basic Phone,"If you want a basic, no frills, inexpensive, nicely designed phone, this phone is for you. I purchased one a few years ago, and when I was looking for a phone for a second location, I went through the same selection process and unbeknown to me at the time, I selected the same phone. The only negative is that the ring is harsh, but you can turn down the volume."
5,Great Phone! Great Price!,"This is a quality yet surprisingly inexpensive phone. Volume control, flash button, nice rubber (but not illuminated) buttons, and great handset w/ crisp, clear sound. Simple, but elegant design. Strongly recommended for anyone looking for a corded phone."
5,Good phone,No battery or power needed just plug-in to phone outlet.Good quality and good price phone $14.95 plus free shipping just a few days...I like it and recommend this product awesome energy saver.
4,Great basic phone,"handset cradle a little too shallow, sometimes hard to tell if phone is properly hung up. otherwise, nice basic phone for the price."
5,Good Purchase,"If you want a good basic (or an emergency) corded phone, this is the one you should get."
1,Junky,"This is a Poor Quality, tinny sounding, junk phone- but if you need one with a cord, it'll do in a pinch."
4,works as advertised,this was just a no-frills basic phone that I purchased for an extra line in my house it does nothing special it just works
2,Leaves a Red mark on the fingers,Leaves a Red mark on the fingers when the gloves are even a little wet - with dew or anything ..
4,"Good, but where is the song from the trailer?","I bought the CD for the songs from the trailer of the movie, but it turns out that those are not here. However, there are good songs. ""Bother"", ""She was my girl"", ""When it started"", ""Hero"", and ""Theme from Spiderman (Aerosmith)"" stand out in the album. This album showcases the nu- music scene. People who listen to stuff such as No doubt, Garbage, and etc will enjoy this."
4,Friendly Neighborhood Soundtrack,"The design of the cover is just beautiful. It really looks like Spider-Man swinging over a city. Fans of Spidey are treated to the original song from the old cartoon series on the opening track.Track 2,""Hero"", is wonderful, and really fits the feel of the character.Aerosmith's rendition of the old Spider-Man song is also well worth listening to.The rest of the music ranges from adequate to mediocre. Still, this is a good buy. And it's got some extra enhancements that you can enjoy on your computer."
3,It's Ok,"This CD isn't that bad i bought it cause i'm a huge Slipknot fan and corey the lead singer has a track on here. I actually bought this CD back when it came out, and didn't know that track would be on Stone Sour's self titled CD. So if thats why you plan to buy it just get Stone Sour'd CD it's very good.The other the songs on here are pretty weak and I wouldn't recommend them except maybe the Sum 41 and Chad Kroegers tracks.Otherwise pass on this one."
2,"Where is the score? Why must we put up with ""songtracks""?","For those of you seeing Spiderman, there's very little on this album that makes it worth listening to. It is yet another ""songs inspired by the film"" ""songtrack"" that has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIE.The only redeeming aspect of this release are the two tracks by ledgend film composer Danny Elfman. Most of you will know him from his scores for Tim Burton such as ""Batman"", ""Batman Returns"", and ""Edward Scissorhands"" (those are just 3 examples - he's done over 60 films). As it goes, there's a touch of ""Batman"" in this score, but Elfman is obviously trying to move away from old style and motifs. ""Main Titles"" and ""Farewell"" are beautiful themes and will (hopefully) earn Elfman another Oscar nomination. This album is just a teaser for score fans like me, and there will most probably be a full score release, but until then we must put up with this. Don't listen to anything else on the CD except tracks 17 and 18."
3,Mainstream Pop Rockers Rejoice,"The tunes on this CD do exactly what they were written to do -market the movie. While I find the same sounding musical portion of the various tracks enjoyable -Bother, Hero, Shelter- I find the lyrical content to be extremely lacking- these are the current crop of ""rock stars"" attempting to write about teen angst but instead translate as crybabies, which, I guess is the same thing although I do not remember being QUITE so whiny as a teenager.Corey Taylor croons, ""Wish I were too dead to cry..."" Both illogical *and* whiny at the same time. What a treat. Put down the kleenex for a moment Corey and tell me how you *really* feel. Nonetheless, the current teeny bopper crop of bubblegum ""rock"" fans will eat this stuff up and the album will be as quickly forgotten as Brittney & Justin's previous hairstyle."
2,Buyer Beware!!!,"If you are looking for a soundtrack of the excellent Elfman music heard during the movie, you will be disappointed. There are only two tracks (thus two stars)--the rest is a lot of forgettable rock stuff..."
2,Two Stars For The Only Good Tracks,"This CD sucks. It doesn't contain good music; it only contains crap. The only exceptional tracks are the ""Main Title"" and ""Farewell,"" both of which are by Danny Elfman. These two tracks are what make this movie great. Including stupid rock music into movies to promote them is just stupid. I would rather buy the Original Score for this movie than this garbage."
4,GREAT,"This soundrack rocks--literally. Even though one or two songs are not that good, this soundrack is still one of the best I have heard in a long time. My favorites are: ""Hero,"" ""Spider-Man theme"" (60's version), ""Spider-Man theme"" (Aerosmith), both Danny Elfman songs, and many more. Do not walk to the music store, crawl or swing to it as fast as you can. With a holographic cover (which is sure to be a collectors item,) it is the best soundrack in the last 5-10 years. What are you waiting for? Go Get It!!"
3,Meh,There are only a few songs on this CD that I'd liked so I can't really recommend getting this CD.
4,Awesome!,This Cd is pretty good. I don't think you'll regret bying it. It has a graet veriety of songs and its something you won't get tired of.
1,"Songtrack, Not a Soundtrack","Danny Elfman did a superb job with this score. His music connects well with the movie. Too bad most of it is left off the official soundtrack release. Maybe a small label can acquire rights to release the Elfman score later. Most of the tracks on this CD has nothing to do with the movie. This CD should be found in the Nu-Rock section of the music store, not the Soundtrack section."
2,"Where is the score? Why must we put up with ""songtracks""?","For those of you seeing Spiderman, there's very little on this album that makes it worth listening to. It is yet another ""songs inspired by the film"" ""songtrack"" that has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIE.The only redeeming aspect of this release are the two tracks by ledgendary film composer Danny Elfman. Most of you will know him from his scores for Tim Burton such as ""Batman"", ""Batman Returns"", and ""Edward Scissorhands"" (those are just 3 examples - he's done over 60 films). As it goes, there's a touch of ""Batman"" in this score, but Elfman is obviously trying to move away from old style and motifs. ""Main Titles"" and ""Farewell"" are beautiful themes and will (hopefully) earn Elfman another Oscar nomination. This album is just a teaser for score fans like me, and there will most probably be a full score release, but until then we must put up with this. Don't listen to anything else on the CD except tracks 17 and 18."
3,This should of been a Nickelback CD,"As in most Soundtracks you hear songs from bands you never heard of. In this case I am sure everyone who has purchased it, has done so for the song Hero which is awesome! The rest do not impact you like Hero, except for the talent of Aerosmith doing their version of Spiderman. Oh yea, it was nice to hear the old version of Spiderman from the TV show."
3,EEEEEEHHH.....,"That guy from Nickelback needs to stop........he [stinks]! He needs to get over that thing that he looks like Jesus, shave that beard! I personally didn't like this CD but he Sum 41 was pretty good, it was tolerable anyway. I really only purchased it to hear the ""Main Titles"" and ""Farewell"" by Danny Elfman and it was worth it. Danny Elfman is a genius with or without Tim Burton. I didn't care for the other tracks. ""Farewell"" offered a real slam-bang finale to the score, which I can't wait for the release of. And always remember ""...With great power comes great responsibility."" You have the power to buy this CD but it comes with great responisbility."
1,what?!?,"how can you call this a soundtrack? these songs aren't in the frickin movie people...get a clue these are compilations made to hype new bands by slapping a name on the CD that will get people to buy it, not saying the songs aren't good, but it has nothing to do with the film, if I want the Spider-Man soundtrack, I'll wait for Elfman's score....you know, the one in the film...."
2,Was it even neccessary to make more than 6 songs?,"If you can get this album for 2.00 its worth it. Otherwise forget it. This must be noted:ALMOST ALL THE SONGS ON THIS SOUNDTRACK ARE NOT IN THE MOVIE!!!! If you have unfortunately bought this album. Your best bet is to copy the couple of songs that were in the film and sell it to a FYE store near you or a used cd place.Remember folks, you can always sell it."
4,"Inspired is right...still ""Amazing""","Bearing in mind that the songs are mostly inspired by the Spider-man movie (as opposed to ""from""), the soundtrack is pretty awesome. I found that some of the songs didn't fit with the movie and were maybe a little too punk-rock. However this is definitely worth buying. There are some thrilling tracks such as ""Hero"", ""Learn to Crawl"", ""Somebody Else"", ""Invisible Man"" and two variations on the 60s Spider-man Theme. Parts of Danny Elfman's score are in the tracklist as well. In addition to the great music, the CD also has enhanced media that can be accessed when used it on your computer in conjunction with the Columbia records Spidey site."
4,Just a few good songs,"There are only just I few songs that I actually listen to. They are: Hero (my favourite song), What We're All About, Spiderman Theme by Aerosmith, Blind and Learn to Crawl. The rest of of the bands I have never heard of."
5,The Best CD I've ever had!!!,"I LOVE this CD,I don't know how to live without it.I am a huge Spidey-man fan,And I loved the movie.Even though some people said a lot of the songs weren't in the movie,I still like it.All the songs are really good(My fav. song is Hero).Well,I guess that's it.Bye!"
5,These songs took my breath away!,"I never write reviews, but this special song needs to be known. The movie itself it's not actually 'different' or a classic, but this 'main' song 'Hero', by Chad Kroeger deserves all the 5 stars again and again!There's no need to say anything about Danny Elfam, right? Who is the stupid person who doens't knows him? His music is, again, brilliant and beautiful! He's one of the best composers I know and he did awesome in this soundtrack.There's no doubt that at least half of the 'magic' about this movie (Spider Man) is also about Danny's songs.I can't tell you to buy this CD, but I can tell you to look for more about Danny Elfman and Chad Kroeger - they rock!Let the magic about a 'classic' hero from the comics get into your 'head' with these great 'btreath-taking' songs!!"
4,Very impressed indeed,Most if not all of the songs on this sound track are very good. This is the first sound track that I have ever bought from a movie and I am very pleased. Some of the songs I heard on the radio way before the movie came out. Absolutely LOVE Aerosmiths rendition of the Spiderman theme. Have to turn that one up as well as the song What we're all about! I throughly enjoy this cd. I recommend buying it!
5,Great Soundtrack,hEh peeps. . i haven even watch the spiderman film. . but after listening to some of the songs. . i'm truely attracted to it. Gonna buy the CD laTer and catch the movie. anyWae Hero by Chad. . was wayoff the best song in the album. . Get it Now. . REally worth it.
5,"Good songs, not score","This is a great soundtrack to go with a great movie!! For those who have insulted people's maturity levels because other people might like this soundtrack (read another review by obiwan48), that truly shows how intelligent that certain person is. Let's just say it doesn't take a rocket scientist to look at the titles and bands of this soundtrack and figure out it is not the full original score. For those looking for the original score, I guess it will be released soon. But for decent pop, this CD is excellent! I like the original Spider-man theme, the version by Aerosmith, and Hero."
5,Spider-Man Album Review.,"What an amazing album! The collaboration of songs is immense. The best song on the album for me was 'Bother' by Corey Taylor. The song just blew me away. I always knew that Corey had extreme talent and this track has proved that he is one of the best singers around. He is one of the few metal singers who is able to sing with such force and passion yet at the same time, is able to sing with such sensitivity. Too classic!"
1,Where's the cool trailer music?!!!,"I was in anticipation of a great sound track after hearing the cool music from the 2 trailers from the web. I went against my better judgement and brought this without previewing it. I was very disappointed, just a bunch of average group/songs ""inspired"" by the movie. I ended up getting rid of the CD, but did keep the cool cover.Besides that, I loved the movie!"
1,Be Warned: Censored Music!,"I love the music on this CD...I hate the fact that the song ""Bother"" by ""Corey Taylor"" was editted to delete a slightly vulgar word. I would suggest not buying this CD since you only get 99.99% of the CD due to the censorship. You won't see a sticker or warning anywhere else regarding this editting, but it's amazing what a difference in a song one word can make."
2,"All this music, and no well-deserved original score","I'll start this review by stating well ahead that I am biased...but maybe I'll help the other people who are biased as I am. Frankly, whenever I think of super-hero movies, I think of the music that will make the cartoon I loved to read as a child come to life, i.e. John William's Superman, and Danny Elfman's Batman. True to that, the only songs I enjoyed listening to in this soundtrack were Elfman's. Not to dismiss the talent of the other artists in this album, but listening to Aerosmith singing the original 60's cartoon theme song only added to my disappointment that Elfman was not hired to create a full score for the entire movie."
2,Not very durable,My son bought this toy and broke it within one day of playing with it. And it was just normal play - nothing extraordinary.
2,A little chalky,"Not as good as I hoped. Also picture is deceptive. I was thinking larger cans... and they're the small ones, so not as much of a bargain as I anticipated. Kinda chalky, and only good if extremely cold."
2,Deceived,When I ordered this I was expecting a big book with many pages. But when it arrived I was highly disappointed. There were few pages and the book itself was very small. I'm very displeased with the product.
5,For my children too,My parents borrowed this record from the library and recorded it to casette to listen to on our first long car trip.I was probably four years old. It quickly became a family favorite. Somewhere a long the way the tape was lost. Two decades had passed when just the other day I happend to catch a snippet of Froggie Went A Courtin on a public radio station. All of those memories came flooding back. Now I am buying it for my own children. I don't know what speaks more powerfully for this album than that.
2,disappointing,"Although highly rated, I found the songs pretty monotonous. Most importantly, my daughter, who loves most music, was bored. Maybe in its day this was great children's music, but there's much better music available now for kids."
4,Great toy for parents and kids,Great Product! Helps my 3 year old learn shapes and colors. Also develops spatial problem solving skills by completing the puzzles. Keeps her occupied for hours...
1,"Ugh... these are cheap, bare-bones, wimpy straps","I'm seldom willing to write a review for an Amazon purchase, but every once in awhile something is so great--or so awful--that I can't help but take the time. This is one of those times when the product is so awful. These straps are cheaply constructed, have very lightweight webbing, and look like they are likely not to last all that long. If it wasn't such a hassle to return things, I would definitely do so. In short, I highly, highly recommend that you look elsewhere. Even the cheapest straps at your local hardware store will be better than this junk."
2,"A pleasant naval adventure, lacking in excitement.","Dudley Pope has written several naval adventures. _Admiral_ is one in a series about Ned Yorke, an English Royalist in the West Indies during the Cromwell's Protectorate.With Cromwell's death, Ned turns from a rebel to a privateer. Attacking the Spanish with his beautiful lover and buccaneer allies, Ned shows his skills as a commander against a background of tropical nature, sailing, treacherous politics and dangerous but declining Spanish Empire.The characters are fairly likable, but there are no interesting villains, and few true challenges, which make the successes in the story less than exciting. The overall lack of suspense, and lack of a motivating cause on the part of the heroes (other than love of excitement and need for money) prevents this book from rising above a mild entertainment."
5,Can't Beat It!,This is my second Manfrotto tripod. I love the quality. Sturdy yet light considering it's aluminum. I use them to mount cameras and astrological binoculars.
3,Not exceptional,"I actually have a first edition of this novel. It begins very strongly and in fact had me crying, but it tends to sag as the novel continues and has a somewhat standard Victorian-type ending of sacrifice and renuciation. Although I do not agree with one biographer of Patience Worth who stated her works would have been considered no better than a housemaid with pretensions except for the unusual manner in which they were written, this novel is not exceptional"
3,Mikasa's Pricing On This Makes No Sense,"I don't know how Mikasa can ask this much for a single 12-inch plate, when a 40-piece set of this china comes with eight 11-inch dinner plates that are only 1 inch smaller (virtually no difference) AND another 32 pieces.Lovely china, but 3 stars on this item for being such a poor value."
1,SIZING WAY TOO SMALL,I returned all 3 pair I ordered due to sizing- WAY TOO SMALL for the size I ordered!
4,Satisfying book of dark tales,"The information given about the book has an error - these stories are primarily chosen from the last part of the 20th century, 1989 to 1999, with several stories written for the book. There isn't a clunker here, and there is something for almost every taste. The stories here take horror seriously. There is some humor, but unlike most current kids horror, there is no goofiness, and the ghosts are all real."
3,What Ever They Play It's GREAT!,"I was very excited to hear the Rollers are back together,it's about time.I've waited a long time for them to make a come back.I've been a fan since they first came to the U.S.A.and I never gave up on them even tho eveyone else I knew did.I knew if I waited long enough they'd come back.I can't wait to hear their new music.So in the words of a true Roller fan,""Keep On Rolling"",and wishes do come true. p.s. Woody your the BEST! I hope you sing lead more often,you've got a great voice! A Roller Fan Forever! J.R."
2,Not the original Bay City Rollers,"Although I knew when I purchased this album that it was Les's 70's rollers I bought it anyway. It was worth the $8.00 but I wouldn't have paid more. The rollers have to understand that they aren't the rollers without all five of the original members: Alan,Woody,Eric,Leslie, and Derek."
5,Terrific Classic Hits,"Very happy I found this CD. The songs here bring back a lot of memories and are a real pleasure to listen to while driving or at the end of the day. I have always loved ""Mockingbird"" and I am thrilled to finally own it. I love this CD!!!!"
2,Another Bad WEA Hits CD Of A Good Artist,"This is another deficient WEA hits CD which contains only about 40 minutes of music (enough for an LP). Does not contain Nobody Does It Better, Coming Around Again, or any other of here later hits. While the box set is available, she deserves a better single disc retrospective than this one."
3,"Too little, too soon","Four of the ten BEST OF CARLY SIMON songs are from her classic album, NO SECRETS, so if you buy one, you may never get the other. BEST OF CARLY SIMON included all her hits up to that point (mid-1970s), so it does not leave you wondering why a certain smash didn't make it. But if Simon had waited one or two albums longer to do this, the lesser songs (""Attitude Dancing"" and ""Legend In Your Own Time"") could have been passed over for genuine hits (""You Belong To Me"" and ""Nobody Does It Better""). Yeah, like Carly cares what I think!"
1,Unsatisfied buyer,I ordered Carly Simon but the record was actually Olivia Newton John in a Carly Simon cover. This was a gift and I was extremely disappointed.
5,Fulton 1200 pound trailer tongue jack,"Very good jack for the cost of item. I recently bought a 3000 pound trailer, and wanted a heavy duty jack, and this has fit the bill quite nicely. I have a 5x8 trailer, and with 2500 lbs of loam on it yesterday, the jack lifted and rolled nicely. It looks to be fairly corrosion resistant, and solidly made."
3,"bought it, and never opened it..","i had to buy this for a macromedia flash class i took, i never opened it once. dont bother learning macromedia, get a program called SWiSH. you can do almost everything you can in macromedia but a thousand times easier."
5,excellent,"This is a title that should be found in any office that is involved in them music industry. With this title the need for a lawyer is eliminated due to the fact that this title is one of the most complete, if not THE complete bundle for music producers and musicians. With this you'll never need an explanation bout nay aspect of a music contracts, are terms and conditions are beautifully explained using real life examples .A golden title that you absolutely must not miss, written by professionals for professionals and novices alike."
4,Business 2 Business,"Yo, this is Prometheus; ""The Original Hater,"" 101 contracts is for serious business. Now, get yourself an attorney and revise.. You have something to say? Let `Em Hear it!Prentice B. JohnsonFounding Chair, CEO, PresidentCipher Productions Incorporatednews@cipherproductionsincorporated.ws6128035924"
5,Great!,"Complete, Accurate, Up-to-date, Informative -- everything I needed to make it out alive when it comes to music contracts. If you are like me, these can get tricky and confusing! 101 Music Business Contracts puts everything in order, ready to use or edit and relevant to any aspect of the industry. One of my best purchases yet!"
5,Super cool.,"This is a cool collection of contracts. At least one of these 101 contracts will fulfill just about every need that you may have. I've been using these contracts for about six months, and have not yet found anything wrong with them, or had any complaints. These contracts are also dirt cheap compared to what my lawyer wanted to charge for his ""collection""."
2,looked good but not comfy,"i bought this shoe in black patent size 8. this shoe looked good on my feet. however it was not true to size. i have slim feet and yet it felt small. the back of the shoe constantly rubbed the back of my ankle causing blisters. i wanted to cry. if i had known, i would have gotten it in a size bigger. couldn't return it for it was shipped to me back home in manila."
1,used to be fun,"The product used to be fun, but now it's so out of date it won't even load. The product was misrepresented by the seller. I expected that since it was in cd format, that it was easily installed. NOPE! The product was shipped with everything EXCEPT the supplement that instructed the installation. The seller refuses to refund my money in full claiming that ""I should have done my own research to be sure it would install"". What a crock!"
1,STATIC,"I have an old stereo system so maybe that had something to do with it, but I couldn't place these speakers anywhere without getting static. Plus, because my system is old I had to use the headphone adaptor which then made my wired speakers not work. I had planned on having my music in all rooms but not with these speakers. I returned them and gave up on trying to make my 1980's technology work. I'm saving for an ipod!"
2,Caution - Not for Surround Sound use !,"We bought two pair of these for Christmas, also my sister bought a pair, and my neice bought a pair. CAUTION ! They do NOT hook up to surround sound systems. (At least in our four different systems). You MUST use a 'line out' output jack and therefore do NOT have volume control except manually at each individual speaker. When you adjust volume or mute DVD, these speakers retain volume level set at each individual speaker. They will work well for remote audio only speakers, like outside to a deck, but not surround sound."
1,What They Don't Tell You,"Their Customer Service rep refused to say approx. how many hours of music 16 alkaline batteries would provide. (If you want to use rechargeable batteries, the speakers must be plugged in to wall outlets with the AC adaptors provided - but then, of course, the speakers are not wireless.)In addition, the sound quality is very poor compared to wired speakers of lesser or equal cost.Having wired speakers is a minor inconvenience compared to the expense and bother of constantly replacing 16 batteries."
3,AR AW871 wireless speakers,"The wireless speakers are great and they were very easy to install. My only disappointment is that the volume is controlled on the speakers themselves; no longer can I turn the volume up or down on my receiver, and my remote for the reciever is useless. It's not a major drawback since I don't play music a lot. I would think if I did, that would be a problem. If AR would come up with a remote for these speakers, that would help."
3,Not too bad of a deal,"Yes, these speakers are nice and good quality, but in my opinion they are a bit overpriced, plus the S&H is too high. They should come out with a better deal on these."
2,very disappointing,"Bought these speakers for work. They could pick up a signal (which is why I gave these 2 stars instead of 1 star) but no matter where I placed the speaker with respect to the transmitter, even inches away, there was very loud static that was extremely annoying. In the end I returned the speakers and went back to just using regular wired speakers (and a lot of speaker wire)."
1,AW 871 Wireless Speakers,"Poor sound quality due to 'static pops' on the detached porch and the basement, the areas where I wanted the wireless speakers. Somewhat better sound in other indoor areas."
3,Worked great....for a while! Help!,I purchased a pair of AR-871 wireless speakers six or eight months ago for our sunroom. The speakers are about 30 feet from the transmitter and worked very well until just recently. Now all I get is static and no sound unless I crank the volume on the stereo up to unacceptably high levels. Then I get some sound and loud static. It's as though something has changed within both speakers at once. I'm not using batteries; the speakers and transmitter are powered by house current. Anybody have a similar problem and found a fix?
1,Poor Sound Quality,"Careful what you wish for. Cheap, but very difficult to tune with consistent sound. If you really want useable sound, invest in a high-end system or just hide your wires."
3,Not great speakers,"If you want to listen at low levels it's okay, but medium volume is plagued by static and pops. I returned them as I feel they were defective."
2,50% failure in two months,"I purchased two sets of these through Amazon. They arrived and initially worked fine. They do not have the advertised range, but were OK for my application. You have to manually tune them every time you turn them on, but still, I was OK with them. Two speakers (one from each set) have now failed within two months. The customers service from Thompson, Inc. is horrible. You send the defective product back at your expense and wait and wait and wait...I cannot recommend this product based on my failures. They are fine when they work. Maybe I am just unlucky."
4,Easy and Convenient,"These are fantastic! I just ordered a second set. Easy to use and very versatile. The transmitter moves easily from PC to stereo to MP3 player. An audio nerd will say they don't sound as nice as a wired set, but for great portable sound for the deck, yard, or etc, you really can not beat these for the price. If you want perfect sound, buy a pair of high-end headphones and sit by yourself. If you want to enjoy music with good sound in less conventional areas where conversation and fun are going on, buy these.One caveat would be that these would probably not be sufficient if you like heavy bass or like to play music very loud. These speakers are too small for that."
4,As expected,"I read the instructions, and found that the set up and operation is Simple and for a wireless system the sound quality is fairly distortion free. Sound quality does not compete with conventional wired speakers, but the quality was as expected."
4,AR wireless speakers,Not bad sound for a wireless 900hz set. Controls are simple & easy to set.Good for garage or basement sound without running wires. AC or rechargable/non-rechargable battery power source makes them quite portable.
3,SECOND TIME CHARM,"The good news is that once you receive a set that works, the sound quality and range of the AR wireless speakers is good. The bad news is you may have to return the first set, like I did, to get one that works. I spent three hours trying every possible configuration to make them work without success. Called the Mfg. hotline and received no help. Amazon was great with the return but it still requires repackaging, taking to PO, etc. The new speakers worked OK out-of-the box."
3,I have not hooked up this product as of yet!,"I can not give you a fair evaluation of this product at this time; because I am waiting to move my living room around, and then I'll be connecting the unit to the system."
1,Broke out of the box,"One of the speakers failed to power on right out of the box. This leads me to question the quality control for the product in general. I'm not messing around with it any more. If it fails to even turn on, right out of the box - it goes back in the box and back to the retailer for a refund immediately. Obviously I cannot rate this product as satisfactory in any way. If you enjoy wasting an hour of your time unpacking and hooking a piece of junk up - only to find it is defective, then this is the product for you."
3,These worked great for 60 days,"I was very pleased with the ease of set-up, the sound quality and the lack of interference. However after 60+ days of use, one of the speakers died. I returned it at my expense to Thomson Inc. as per phone instructions from Thomson. That was last week. I'm waiting to see the speed and performance of Thomson under their warranty."
3,Review for wireless speakers.,"The first set of speakers that I got one of them did not work without lots of static.The second set worked just fine.I wanted these wireless speakers for my stereo system, but the sound is just not the same as the main speakers. But I found a very good use for them: extra speakers for my TV. For the TV, I love them. Do not plan on using them for replacement to your entertainment center, but for extra, they work great.Anyway, you get what you pay for and Amazon has a great price on these speakers so you are getting a very good deal.Richard"
1,I had the same problem my speakers would turn on.,"I had these speakers for about a year when they when out. I went to Best Buy and bought another pair. Here is what I found out. The speakers are fine. No problem with them. It was the power adapter that went out on the speakers. Within three hours, the power adapter went out again on of my speakers. I changed adapter with the other speaker that was working and it quit working. Within another hour, the second power adapter was gone. I took the pair that I bought from Best Buy back and now I'm trying to figure out what I can do with the other pair of speakers. There should be laws against impostor, because that what these speakers are all about. Don't buy these speakers."
2,Don't function as Surround Sound rear speakers,"I'm a little miffed. These speakers connect to LINE (RCA) outputs, not speaker outputs. Unless your receiver/amplifier has LINE outputs specifically for the REAR SURROUND signal, these will NOT function as rear surround speakers, in direct contradiction to the technical description on Amazon. Just got off the phone with Tech Support who immediately acknowledged my conclusion. You can hook them up to a TAPE OUT, or even a headphone jack, but you wont be getting surround sound...just more of the regular Left and Right signals. I give 2 stars instead of 1 since Amazon is being pretty good about taking them back, at least so far.I can't speak for the sound quality since I could never hook them up."
4,Very Good Speakers - Easy to Install,"Ordered my wireless speakers from Amazon a day ago. I was surprised that they were delivered in 1 day! Opened the box and read the installation manual first. I was able to get both speakers up and running within 5 to 10 minutes - no problem. The speakers sound very good...not as crisp as the speakers hard wired to my receiver, however for wireless speakers they sound good. My only complaint is that to connect to a stereo, you have to use the 'headphone output jack' of the receiver - which cuts off the sound to my hardwired speakers when using wireless speakers. Oh well, can't have it all I guess, however these speakers serve my original purpose of having my receiver music being heard in the kitchen and other rooms 'without running speaker wire'."
2,Good sound but irritating interference,"I thought the audio quality out of the speakers was good. It is very nice to be able to put a speaker anywhere in your house and listen to music. However, despite following all the manufacturer instructions, I could not position or tune the speakers to get noise free reception. There would periodically be a quick hiss or whoosh similar to bad FM reception. I was surprised that the transmission mode between the base and speakers is analog and not digital, which would have provided a noise free sound output. These speakers would probably work fine as part of a surround sound setup where the speakers are in the same room as the base. Anyway, I returned them to the store I purchased them from."
3,NOT FOR SURROUND SOUND,"What was not clear ro me is that the speakers are not able to connect to surround sound speaker connection. That was the main reason I purchased, however, once past that disappointment, I consoled myself with using them outside in the yard. So far they seem to be working fine.After approx. two months unit failed and was returned to Thomson customer service. Customer service was less than satisfactory and I wound up having to contact Amazon, who made good on the transaction by returning my money. Thomson needs a lesson on customer service!"
4,Home Music System,"The AW-871 allows me to use our home computer as the base for our music system. The broadcast antenna can be located anywhere near the computer. The speakers can be located anywhere in the house. If only one speaker is to be used in a room, it can be switched from Sterio L or R to Mono. The sound quality is very good. However, at a distance, the single push button tuning on the speakers may combine audio from another source with your audio. The further the speakers are from the source the more patience is needed to lock in on your audio. A tuning dial would have been more practical."
3,Peggy,"The audio from these speakers is good except for some static at times. We live in a condo and sometimes the transmitter receives a signal from our neightbor, so that is not so good."
1,piece of junk,"I bought a pair of these brand new 1 year ago. They worked fine at first, but as time went by, one developed a static-like buzzing in the bass and I eventually had to stop using it because it ruined the sound. Within a month or two the other developed the same sound and now both speakers are completely useless. I'm stunned that in this day and age a product can be so poorly made that they go bad in less than a year. I'd read negative reviews beforehand and just figured people didn't know what they were doing. Now I know...BUY THESE AT YOUR PERIL. I have replaced them with other wireless speakers that work fine."
1,"Was happy at first, then they died!!",The speakers worked great for the first 5-6 months then both died. Now I have nice pair of dust collectors on my self. DON'T BUY!!
4,Acoustic Research Wireless Speakers....not too shabby,"I must say that this product received much more scathing reviews than I felt it deserved, so I'm glad I gave it a chance. For the purposes of simply spreading music around the house without blowing out the immobile ones attached to my computer, these speakers are rather impressive, to be honest. No, it's not for you if you are an audiophile, as you're not going to get the highest quality bass (although I really dare not complain), and - YES....there is occasional static. I'm much more pleased with these than I thought I'd be. The only obstacle I ran into at all was that I was already using the one headphone jack on the back of my computer; this was a quick, cheap fix by purchasing from Wal-Mart a cheap-o headphone splitter. Got music all over the house now. Took maybe 10 minutes to set up. And much cheaper on Amazon than at Best Buy for exact same product (literally 1/2 the cost). :)"
2,Not quite,"I purchased this system to use at a summer cottage to have flexibility in positioning speakers. I've been disappointed with their functionality. The speakers work fine when in the same room, but when just 30-40 ft away, event with a sliding glass door in between, the signal doesn't get through or else one of the speakers wails away at an incredible frequency. Charging is not guaranteed. I can get one speaker to work if I turn it on near the antennae then walk it out to where I want it. The other just wails. Yes - I did read the manual several times."
2,POOR REVIEW,I'm really disappointed with these Acoustic Research AW-871 Wireless Stereo Speakers. They have alot of static even when there's no sound come through them. I sent them back for a replacement and I think the company sent me back the same speakers I sent back. They work no better this time then before I shipped them back. Would stay away from this product.
1,"Good concept, Bad product.",These speakers were easy to set up and had the range needed but the sound quality was horrible. One of the speakers even sounded like it was blown right out of the box. The other speaker didn't sound much better with a constant clicking to the beat of the music. It took 5 minutes to set up and less than that to decide the sound was to poor. You don't need to be a music snob to not be able to tolerate the lack of sound quality these speakers produce.
2,Didn't work right often enough...,"Installation was not difficult, but once in place they often crackled and popped. Changing channels or moving location didn't have any effect. The sound was pretty good when there was no interference, but it happened too often for them to be worth keeping. I returned the product..."
