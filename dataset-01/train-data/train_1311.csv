2,lots of special effects but a ridiculous plot,"This was a terrible film. I'm one who enjoys most science fiction, with all the special effects, even the bad ones. It did have wonderful special effects, so many though, it was almost too much. The plot was stupid, hard to believe and was way too long, I kept waiting for it to end. The only thing that kept me from turning it off, was, trying to see if it could actually get any worse. And it did. Sorry I bought this, I wonder if I can give it away."
2,"""We're Gonna Party Like It's 2012""","There's plenty of apocalypse to go around in writer-director Roland Emmerich's derivative, overlong disaster epic. Despite excellent visuals and the best efforts of John Cusack and Company, ""2012"" wears out its welcome before the halfway mark. Too bad Prince was unable to provide the musical accompaniment."
1,This movie was just awful,"I went to this film for the special effects. I find it amazing that before it was over I was actually tired of seeing them. Cities being destroyed actually got boring. I could pick apart the many problems in this film, but why bother. This film is bad, bad, bad, bad, bad."
1,This movie sucked and blowed at the same time,"This movie has one thing going for it; it is truly a piece of junk from beginning to end. So many people made sure to ruin their so called career by starring in this smoldering turd. I was forced to see this piece of junk garbage do yourself a favor and do not let anyone make you see this, I don't care they threaten you with divorce, you will be better off divorced than having to see this."
1,2012,"no spanish subtitles, no exist 12000000 people speak spanish in EE.UU.,and the rest Latin America?"
2,Less Subtitles - More illegal Downloads !!!,"I only give two stars because of the lack of spanish subtitles. Although I can read english subtitles without problems, many people don't have this possibility. From my humble point of view, the big risk for Sony and other companies who play with this thing of the ""subtitles"" is that this kind of decisions will only incentive and produce more illegal downloads than the usual. If you bring many subtitles you will not avoid that illegal activities, but I think that you will reduce some of them and also sell more movies at no additional cost. Everything counts, please remember that !!!. Many thanks and good luck for everybody !!!"
1,2012,Save the Politians/world leaders? They will be the first to DIE because they caused the destruction of this world.
2,Horrible,"OMG....VERY VERY BAD....THE MOVIE LOOKED SO FAKE....""THE DAY AFTER TOMM."" WAS WAY BETTER THEN THIS....AWFUL MOVIE I RECCOMMEND RENTING...YOU'LL REGRET WASTING 20 BUCKS ON A LOUSY MOVIE LIKE THIS"
2,Cheesy,"Limburger! Special effects and dialog are much worse than it's predecessor, 'Day After Tomorrow'."
4,Corny story but Fun & Entertaining,"Be willing to suspend belief and hang on for one special effect after another. There's nothing offensive for kids . . . the bad guys are bad and the good guys are heroes. While not a comedy, the movie doesn't try to take itself too seriously, delivering a balanced mix of drama and tongue-in-cheek humor."
3,2012,"This movie is not the best world apocalyptic movie I have watched, but the acting probably is. It has a world-class cast that execute their parts perfectly. There are a few parts in the movie that I believe could've been written better, but overall a good movie."
3,Good Movie,"this was one of those movies that I thought about watching on many occasions, just never got around to it. I finally watched it and found that it was really good. No, the science was not 100%, and a lot of the scenarios the characters found them selves in were not realistic. However, I was not looking for real. I was looking to see some adventure and danger, I found it. There were some great laughs and me and my family were even routing for certain things to happen. If you are looking for a fun, end of the world type movie, I think that ""2012"" is a great choice."
4,Big budget disaster movie we all love,"A good movie overall if you can just enjoy it for what it is. Yes we all know they really can't do that with a car but so what. You watch for the action not the realism. So let go and pop some popcorn, forget about the bad day at work or the 164 things that need to be done and have a couple of hours of take me away time."
2,2012,"2012 is a 2009 science fiction disaster film that puportedly is about the end of the world. The special effects are quite impressive and the music is quite effective. However, here the praise ends. The script could have been written on a wafer. The acting is often over the top and the storyline is both predictable and silly. The dialogue seems that have been written by high school drop outs. If one loves great special effects then this film is passable. Otherwise, I do not recommend this thoughtless film. Not recommended. 2/5."
4,Eye candy,"The basic story line was fairly minimal, relying on FX to make this a watchable film. If you're in the mood for great effects, a lot of action, but not having to tax your brain following a complex plot, then this is for you."
3,A Good Movie If You Are Into This Genre,"We actually enjoyed this movie. It reminded us of movies we have seen in the past such as Independence Day. While it is a bit ""far-fetched"", we found it entertaining. The sound track was great."
2,okay,"Movie was okay. Cast was good, effects were so-so. wish I had watched this movie before buying."
3,"Very Good VFX, Story Lacks","This blu-ray release is very good, in Picture Quality and Audio. The Extras are fine. But the film's plot is not that strong. Is difficult to connect to the main characters. Putting a side that, the VFX's are amazing, the Audio is intense. And the sequences are very good maintain you entertained.Bottom line, is a good movie to be entertained, not to feel the characters."
2,for very young,"the movie is really spectacular, but most is too much unrealistc, more like a comics."
5,2012 with Adam Lambert singing theme song,"I saw 2012 at the movies on the big screen and it was amazing. I think the special effects are great. One thing I really loved was Adam Lambert's song""Time For A Miracle"". On the DVD, it has him singing this song as a video, amazing to get this extra feature on the DVD. So if you are a Lambert fan, get a copy of this DVD, worth it for sure just to see Adam."
4,Just don't expect this movie will change your life and you will enjoy it,Plot is sometimes cringe-inducing but special effects are great. Blu-Ray is worth the purchase at reasonable price. Need 3 more words
2,No.....just....no.,It's like watching the fever dream of someone who watches waaaaaaaay to much Fox News. Incoherent plot. I honestly didn't get attached to a single character in the movie.....I take that back. Blu Mankuma and George Segal were the only two people in this movie that seemed to have a soul. There was just too much going on and not enough substance.
3,Movie OK,"Typical end of the world type movie. The action parts and special effects were well done, but didn't think it had much of a plot or story line. I've seen better............."
4,disaster film,Excellent special special effects. It is impossible funny at times. Great acting by all. Don't miss this one. A real ride.
2,GET IT FROM THE LIBRARY,"SAVE YOUR MONEY - check it out from your local library - OR do what I wish I had done - SAVE YOUR TIME, TOO! Don't get me wrong - I LOVE DISASTER MOVIES and I really like several of the actors who appear in this movie. Appear? Yes, their presence is too lame to be called ACTING. I blame the director, the terribly awful dialogue, and a very poor script for producing a time waster of epic proportions. Cliches are to be expected in this genre of movie but EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS OVERDONE with the possible exception of the special effects which are very badly done considering all that is possible with today's special effects/technology. To say I was disappointed is a huge understatement. I am very happy that I checked it out from the library and saved the $16.99 for another DVD with more merit and the prospect of being watched more than once!"
2,Five Stars for Animation & One for Story/Script,"Positive:The animation/graphics were exceptional. Worth seeing the movie just for that reason.Negatives:(1.) Really bad science not only for the basic science of neutrinos and Earth core heating but for the subsequent movement of the Earth's crust and the quantity of water needed to cover Mt. Everest and most everywhere else.(2.) Juvenile, contrived script & dialogue. If people really talked like they some writers want them to, especially in stressful conditions, we would think of them as clueless, numskull idiots.(3.) Weak story with too many stolen-from-other-movies stereotypes, e.g. Russian fighter; divorced dad trying to entertain kids and ex-wife; female escort with mini-dog; crazy DJ (another bizarre and poor acting by Harrelson); government conspiracies and assassinations; pack the kids to escape the apocalypse; driving cars off of crashing airplanes in snow fields."
3,visual feast of effects and silliness,"Take this movie for what it was meant to be: pure visual spectacle with lots of effects, silly plot elements, forced emotion, desperation, and goofy stuff like carrying elephants and giraffes by helicopter to the big arks.Don't make it about any more than that, don't take it seriously, and you will be just fine."
2,great special effects but ...,"that's about it. The story is predictable and fairly generic. Not much to say about this flick except it's interesting that the only people saved are politicians and folks who can afford to pay. In any case, I'll give it 2 stars for the effects."
2,A Special Effects Bonanza,"The special effects in this movie are amazing. It's like watching a train wreck over and over again only nobody gets killed but Woody, and that's a good thing because it puts him out of his misery. If you enjoy a good story with characterization, plot, and theme this is not the movie for you. Maybe, just maybe, if I had watched it on a big screen, probably Imax in 3D, it would have held my interest, as it was I fell asleep toward the end of the movie. It was so mediocre I didn't even bother to watch the rest of it the next morning.I'm glad I didn't pay to see it at the box office. I can't wait to mail it back to Netflix."
2,Do not buy!!,This movie is ok however the blue ray disk sucks!!! This companies keep making discs that won't play on Power DVD version 8 and prompt you to buy version 9 so they can make more $$. [...]I have Music CD's and I can play 10 years old cd on any CD player and they play. Now with this Blu Ray disk you have to keep updating the software or it won't play. It will play on the Sony PS3 made by Sony but not on your computer even if you have Power DVD. This really sucks!!I won't to blog sites and a lot of people are having the same problem with this movie. It starts but there is no menu to play the movie so you can not see it.This companies sould get a class action suit so they can start making products that you can use in any Blue ray player.
2,Not much to shout about.,"Watched it last night(3/30/10). If not for some decent CGI and Woody Harrelson's comic character, I would have ejected the disc out and chalked it up to over hype. 2012 had all of the potential to spin a tale about the Mayan prophecies but it failed miserably. Giant Arks in which only the politicians and wealthy survive, Egads! Do yourself a favor and save yourself 20+ bucks."
3,2012 final?,"general review, Bad things: the letterbox is too much, film too dark, no special features-cheap-""tight when it squeaks-whatever"", also, its listed but then it says may not be there and at the end of most of these fx"" you can clearly see the usual stupid, cheap fake now days digital animated pc fx, it could have had better action scenes, otherwise a long, pretty good movie."
1,Darn near the worst movie I've seen,"Horrible acting, stupid plot, and disappointing special effects. A better ending would have had all the actors including the kids, as well as everybody behind the scenes who contributed to this shameless production, dying. Getting smashed by a tidal wave or vaporized by molten lava would have been too good an ending for those who helped produce this. Getting eaten by red ants over several hours or better yet days would be more fitting. I'm pissed that I bought this thinking it would be worth a 2nd viewing. It's the type of movie you last through the end because you're thinking the whole time that ""it's got to get better than this."" It never does! Save your money and make better use of your time. This movie is the biggest fraud of late that has been perpetrated on humanity. Why isn't Barack doing a better job policing Hollywood?"
4,2012= an ok film,This is a great film by Roland Emmerich but not as great as his previous films. if you really want this movie i would highly recommend getting this film on blu ray as the special effects were great and they are amazing to watch on the bluray. the only reason i gave this film a 4 star is because in my opinion the acting was average nothing great and i dont really agree with the plot and how it played out. Nonetheless this film is a great addition to your movie shelf and i would highly recommend to see this film at least once.
1,What an awful film,"This film has perhaps one thing to recommend it and that's some of the visuals. Apart from this aspect, it really is a complete waste of time and money and I deeply regret purchasing it.The story is representative of what appears to be the very worst of Hollywood which appeals to the same sort of base instincts that make people want to stop and look at accidents - it has no intellectual content whatsoever, the story is vacuous, the parts are completely unbelievable and what might have been interesting, an exploration of the predictions by the Mayans and Nostradamus are left out completely. Presumably deemed too challenging for the targeted audience.Don't waste your money, honestly."
1,First Blue Ray Rented - Good video but bad screenplay,I chose 2012 as my first Blu-Ray movie when I got my new HD televisiona and Blu-Ray DVD player. The picture was outstanding and showed on Blu-Ray capibilities to the fullest. But the movie itself was an exercise in over the top movie making with some of the lamest dialogue ever written for the screen. After about an hour I kept looking at my watch wondering when this movie was going to end. Blue-Ray is great but bad movies are bad movies no matter what the format. Still if you need a DVD to amaze your friends this will do the trick.
5,action,"I BOUGTH THIS IN BLUE RAY ANF IT WAS WELL WORTH IT,IT HAS LOTS OF ACTION AND IS 2 AND 1/2 HOURS LONG.I AND MY WIFE REALY ENJOYED IT. GOD BLESS"
1,not a movie,"1* because this is not a movie - it is more of a computer animation project (or call it as you wish) in which some people (actors) and some story are included just to give it a false sense of being a movie. Everything else but the computer magic is devoid of any meaning and sense. Visually, totally impressive, no doubt, who likes those things will be awed. I stopped watching after 30 or so minutes when it became clear what it is all about."
1,"OMG, When will it end!","It's long, about an hour longer than it ever should have been. And it filled with CGI, not all of it good by the way. John Cusak's character must have done something really bad in another life, because in the one that he plays in this film he's followed by a never ending earthquake from one side of the planet to the next, and it never lets up! It doesn't matter if he's in a car or a plane, the earthquake stalks him...where are the police to arrest that nasty menace of a quake?!Seriously though, if it had been an hour shorter it would have at least been tolerable. As it was I just kept watching and praying that it would end soon, since I have an inability to not at least see the ending of a film once I've paid my money to watch it. And the worst part is that as an actor I like John Cusak in other films that he's done."
1,Two hours that I won't get back...,"I liked the other movies from Roland Emmerich and was hoping to see something exciting with great visual effects.Unfortunately, it was boring, predictable, the actors were really bad and the special effects looked as if they were made 15 years ago. When the ground is initially separating behind somebody running, then behind a car driving, then behind a plane taking off, this is seriously getting old. Some special effects were great, the vast majority so bad though that you immediately thought about the green room these scenes were taken in. Planes that after takeoff do not gain altitude, but drop a few thousand feets, then fly maneuvers that physically would not be possible, the scale of the model used does not match the environment and so on ...For me this was the worst movie I have seen in the last 2-3 years, not worth the money, but maybe for younger kids that do not have a lot of comparison, it might be an O.K. movie."
2,"Really cheap-looking CG effects, terrible script","I'm just glad I didn't go see this at the theatre and saved myself $11 plus tax. I ended up renting it for a buck at my local DVDXpress kiosk, and was I disappointed.First of all, the script sucks. And the fact they put a black president in the film feels so forced, plus the guy - surprise! - decided to stay behind and allow himself to die. How heroic. Every aspect of the plot is either predictable, or plain laughable.And then, the CG effects are just plain cheap-looking and almost crude at times. All those deaths, simulated with cold objectivity, make one wonder if the director cares about humanity himself, or maybe he's secretly rooting for mankind's demise, or at least that of everyone who's not important on this earth (that's you and me, pal). The ending is way too predictable; for example: divorced husband, live; ex-wife's boyfriend, die."
2,One of the cheesiest movies ever made,"The special effects were fantastic, but the rest of the movie was terrible. The human interactions were maudlin. The story line was ridiculous. We were led to believe that the planet was going to be totally destroyed, only to find out that it was possible to survive this cataclysm in a buch of boats. If this disaster was foreseen, why weren't there more boats? As is usual with disaster movies, we are presented with the private lives of the main characters, their ambitions and their struggles. But it was all so sickening. Even though the special effects were tremendous, they hardly make up for the terrible story line and dialogue."
1,This blu-ray disk takes FOREVER to load...,"The blu-ray took more than 10 days to deliver, however, the slow delivery was not the worst part: the disk itselftook more than 45 minutes to load on my SONY blu-ray player. I was disappointed since my kids had waited the wholeSpring Break to see the ""loading bar""...Hopefully I could play the movie before 2012."
1,2012,"You sent it in Blu Ray an i don't have a blu player but no one told me i needed an additional player for this don't ever send my movies in Blu Ray again i got a measley 3,00 refundthat sucks"
4,A fun book,"This was a fun book, and if I had read it before reading King Fortis the Brave I might have given it five stars. But because I read it after finishing King Fortis, which was superior in many ways, the best I could do was four.Still, that's not to say that this book does not have a lot going for it, and that Abbott isn't a very good writer. If you're looking for a young adult fantasy novel and you haven't read King Fortis yet, try that first. But if you've already read King Fortis the Brave and are looking for another good romp through a fantasy world, you can do a lot worse than this book!"
1,SUCKS,bought this to get the data from my old pc to the new one. my vista pc wont recognize it. my xp laptop wont. this thing sucks DO NOT BUY!
1,Defunct Company,"The Bad:The stand for the enclosure was missing from the package. I attempted to get support from their website, no luck there, a time-out message appears. I called the phone number that was supplied in the instruction manual, 909-348-0680, only to hear the message, ""that number has been disconnected"". It appears you will be on your own if you buy any of their products. 2.22.09"
4,"Lots of plot building in this book, but not much action.","Parasyte is one of my favorite mangas. Heck, it is my favorite comic, right next to Blade of the Immortal, Spiderman, and Cerebus. It is a thinking-man's story, and I think that's the reason I like it so much. A lot of the story is built around the characters and how they deal with an alien invasion that is killing out the human race!This fifth volume has the least action of any Parasyte graphic novel that I have read yet. Most of the story is built around showing how the bad Parasytes are trying to fit in with society. They establish themselves as a (secret) political power, so that they can hide all the deaths in the city better and keep public panic down. Shin and Lefty spend most of the book just walking around, amazed at how organized the bad Parasytes have gotten. Towards the end of the book, there is a MAJOR confrontation between a Parasyte and someone close to Shin. Shin starts to doubt his own humanity."
4,The world begins to discover the parasytes....,"In this 5th installment, the world has discovered the existence of the parasyte monsters and has devised a test to determine who is ""one of them"". People go around pulling out each other's hair, with amusing results. Lots of gore and killer b&w art characterize this manga series, and this book doesn't disappoint. If you are in the mood for an interesting and imaginative read, this one's for you!"
1,"How true is this ""true story""?","There are allegations flying back and forth between Ann Rule and a journalist named Rick Swart about how much is true in this ""true"" story. While neither side seems entirely blameless, I suggest that you read this article addressing some of the concerns before deciding if you want to buy this book:[...]"
2,BORING,"I am beginning to think Rule is being paid by the number of words she writes. Very disappointed with this book.....half way through it and doubt I can finish it as I do not need to know what every stick, stone and leaf is like. Didn't think she would ever get to the story. Also so tired of hearing what Liysa is wearing, how she combs her hair and on and on and on. Let's get to the meat of the story before I fall asleep again."
3,Heart Full of Lies is not so full,"I picked up Ann Rule's latest yesterday with great anticipation. I've read every one of her books, and had high expectations for her latest. I was greatly diappointed when I opened the book and saw the size of the font. It almost looks like a large-print book for people with sight problems. This tells me there wasn't nearly enough material for a nearly-400 page book. I am very diappointed, and Ann Rule has fallen from my list of all-time favorites."
1,BOOK FULL OF YAWNS,"Most of Ann Rule's true crime books play to her female demographic target by being anti-male screeds.""Heart Full of Lies"" is her attempt to add a touch of balance by writing about a an especially dislikeable woman who murders her genuinely likeable husband.Trouble is that Rule's writing needs an injection of caffeine. It's just sleepy. She just slogs through to the end, making little effort to energize the story. That's a shame, since the reader comes away feeling that Rule has been a bit uninterested in the story herself, and that a more compelling tale could be told by a writer who does not have so many books to her name that she's just coasting her way to a best seller.The writing at times looks like it didn't even go through a first-pass edit.Murderous Liysa is clearly evil on so many levels that any writer who put in the effort to tell the story could have produced something at least marginally readable. ""Heart Full of Lies"" is Rule at her laziest."
4,Shorter than Usual but still Excellent,"I agree with some of the earlier comments about how short this book is when compared to some of her other works (wow, what big type!) BUT I found it as captivating as ever. Slight SPOILER alert: It differs in that it's focus is a woman who kills her husband (who exaggerated the conditions of her marriage). Her other female focused books were, tragically, about how they killed, or tried to kill their children (Bitter Harvest, Small Sacrifices). Call me a huge fan. Ann Rule, thank you for providing human stories with tact and care."
4,Another profile of a sociopath by Ann Rule,"I just bought this book Saturday afternoon and could not put it down-- I was finished by Sunday evening! I am a big fan of Ann Rule and all of her books. This story is a profile of a sociopath, Liysa Northon, who managed to fool an awful lot of people into thinking she was an abused wife, when really she was projecting her own rage (and murderous thoughts) onto her husband. The lies she told, and the lengths to which she went to perpetuate her story, were astonishing! This is definitely a good read; not as complicated a story as some of Ann Rule's others (my favorite is ""Dead by Sunset""), but interesting nonetheless."
4,This book grabbed me and held me...,Fascinating character study of a really socio-pathetic woman!!! She Isa cold blooded murderer. She got off easy so I guess all her conniving paid off. She is already remarried. I feel she will leave more victims before she is through!!
5,I love Ann Rule Books,I always enjoy Ann Rule books. She is an excellent writer that captures my attention and keeps me engrossed in the story. I have a hard time putting her books down. I look forward to reading all her books!
5,Ann Rule Always Delivers,"If you enjoy intelligent, non-exploitive and well-written true crime than chances are you are already an Ann Rule fan. If you haven't read Ann Rule's books before you're in for a treat and Heart Full of Lies is as good a place as any to start. At the center of many of Ms Rule's books are sociopaths and Liysa Northon is a prime example of a classic sociopath. Whether feigning amnesia for 4 months or shooting her husband in ""self-defence"" while he was asleep, Liysa is a piece of work. Ann Rule tells her story and the story of her victims and their families. She doesn't glorify murderers or their crimes, she focuses on what creates them, enables them and the damage they leave behind. IMHO, along with Shana Alexander, Truman Capote and Thomas Thompson, Ann Rule is a true crime author who elevates the genre every time she writes."
2,Should have waited for the paper back version,"It almost seems like someone else wrote this book other than Ann Rule. It was not up to her standards at all. I have read every book she has written, and I know how she writes. This book is not her best work.The editing leaves a lot to be desired as well. Some sentences don't make any sense.Ms Rule must have had something else to do and just wanted to put this book out in a hurry.I look forward to reading her next book though!"
2,I just don't like this author....,"...which is a shame because she seems to be so nice on her web site. The characters do not seem to have any depth in any of her books, and her writing style is easy to read but does not offer complex details about the people involved with the story. You never really feel like you were there seeing all the action unfold like you do with true crime authors Thomas Thompson and Jack Olson. I was disappointed again with this overly simplistic story that should have been told like a mystery but was not."
2,bookfull of lies,"This book is overall written very well, however I thought a ""true crime"" book was supposed to contain mostly factual information. I am a family member (a first cousin) to Liysa Northon and I found 95% of the ""facts"" to be appalling and incorrect. I believe this author should at least donate a portion of her sales from this book to the victims of domestic violence charity."
2,one side of the story,"This is a very one sided story...For being a true crime novel I think Ann Rule could have done a little more research. Chris is made out to be this angelic person while Liysa is thought of as a demonic creature not even a person. While i do believe that Liysa was a little on the deranged side, I don't think it is that far off to assume Chris wasn't the perfect person Rule makes him out to be. It's a great story, but i don't think it should be considered a ""True Story"" and for that I don't think it should have an overall good rating."
2,Another disappointed Ann Rule fan,"I usually really appreciate Ann Rule's books, so I'm sorry to say that this one is a bust. The storytelling is simply not up to her standards. There are no thrilling twists, no courtroom intrigue, no real surprises. I don't feel I know much more about the characters after reading the book than I did after reading the dust jacket. Wait for it in paperback."
4,Excellent Page-Turner,"I do not agree with the other reviews at all. I thought this book was excellent. At times it made me sick to my stomach, as I could not believe someone could be as manipulative and selfish as Liysa. I feel horrible for the victim, Chris, his family, and his sons. I would highly recommend this book."
2,Heart Full of Disappointment,"I hate to give anything by Ann Rule two stars - - but here it is. I just did not like this book. It seemed very rushed, compared to some of her ""classics"", like The Stranger Beside Me and Small Sacrifices. The principals were not fleshed out and Liysa Northon was just not that interesting of a character. Certainly no one deserves to be a victim of any type of crime, but I did not find myself compelled with Chris Northon's story or his death. There was no mystery as to who killed him and Liysa's eventual plea bargain stopped the court proceedings in the book.I would have to say that this weak story might have been better served in one of Ms. Rule's True Crime files, where it might have gotten less than 50 pages, versus the devotion of an entire book."
2,Not my favorite of Ann Rule's books,"I have liked Ann Rule's books, but not this one. It was repetitive -- same basic descriptions over and over demonstrating that Liysa Northon was a narcissist. She isn't a very interesting person, really. The story isn't a very interesting one either. It doesn't stand out as a true-crime story. It's no surprise what happened."
2,disappointing for ann rule fans,"I've read and enjoyed all of Ann Rule's books, so when I saw this on the front table of the bookstore I bought it without even opening it up. Everyone knows what to expect from an Ann Rule book, right? Unfortunately, not this time. As another reader pointed out, the type is huge... always a bad sign of padding. It actually jars you when you open the book to start reading. What, it HAD to be 350+ pages? It's a compelling story but could have been half as long. The editor really let her down on this one. Choppy, disjointed, repetitive. Back and forth in time and place. Very hard to follow, and the writing is never smooth. Wait for it in paperback. Really."
3,"Lies, greed, abuse?","I found this book interesting and by the end I could make the same conclusion that Ann did. In reading the foregoing review by the woman who said that Ann was not correct in all of her statements of her findings, and another that she was being sued by Liysa, I googled it and her suit was dismissed. She then sued her attorneys and if she should manage to get a new trial, she could face over 25 years in jail rather than her present term. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in mysteries based on fact."
4,Nice bulb,The original bulb on this Princeton Tech Surge/torrent don't last long.The new bulb is very nice and bright.I sure hope it lasts longer than the last one.The cost of the bulb and the shipping charge are about equal.It cost about twenty dollars to get the bulb replaced.It would probably be cheaper to get it at a dive store due to the extortive shipping charges.The actual entirely new flash light only cost $39.00.
5,Over the Moon for This,"What a great little vintage book. Get a copy now before CSPIA makes them all illegal.Very sweet and clever story. Dad is amazingly resourceful about ""getting"" Emily the moon for her very own.It should be republished."
2,Only edible in small amounts as an ingredient,"Length:: 2:27 MinsAs I mention in the video, the Hormel Lean Smoked Ham has a strong chemical flavor that I do not like. If you cut the ham into small pieces and mix it with a large amount of rice, beans, pasta, etc... then it would probably taste ok. But when mixed with a relatively small amount of noodles, the taste of the chemical preservatives is so overwhelming that it makes your snack/meal almost inedible. Having said that, everyone's taste preferences are slightly different, so you may want to pick up 1 can at your local grocery store and decide for yourself."
1,Buy the Spam.,"Strong, salty taste with a fishy aftertaste. I ate most of one can and will give the others away."
1,Disappointed!!,"Since these cans of Ham are supposedly almost fat free, I was surprised that I found so much fat on the periphery of the can. And it tastes like there is a salt shaker full of salt in each can too. All in all I find these Hormel Chunk Lean Ham to be a bit on the disgusting side. I will try using them for appetizers after adding onions, olives, chives, lots of pepper, celery, etc etc to try to smooth out the rather grosstaste onto crackers or roasted bread pieces. A strong overwhelming salt taste can be subdued but it really requires a lot of work and forethought. Don't expect a delicious HAM taste to be present though. This is the first time I have tried these cans of lean ham but I will not be buying these again. I DO NOT recommend them to anyone!"
2,Hormel Smoked Ham,uggggg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!on its own. but if combined it is OK. SAAALTY! should have pull lid. try this fryed.not straight from the can.
5,canned ham,I really like this ham. I make a heated sandwich with it and do not liked the smoked ham - it is an entirely different product. This is not too smoky. My store doesn't carry it anymore so was happy to find it at Amazon!
2,Didn't Work,My experience is exactly as the other reviewer. I used the i.Beat Cebrax FM MP3 player for less than two days and its display quit working. I was able to get a hold of the manufacturer and several phone calls and emails later was told that I needed to return the player and get it replaced. Hopefully the replacement will work!!!
1,Broken,I used the Cebrax MP3 play less than 5 minutes and its display quit working. A few phone calls later we found out that we needed to return the player and get it replaced. Maybe the replacement will last longer...
5,Good Value,"I just received this. I plugged it into my computer with media player open. Then put the songs in the sync list. Clicked sync. The computer did the rest. Can't get any easier than that. Good sound too. Now those of you with older computers may need to put some extra software on for this, but I don't know. Mine is a 2000. I love this little gadget. It is so small and holds all the songs I want. So if you are looking for a bargain and don't need an overkill of space for songs then this one's for you. One thing to look out for- before installing the battery that comes with it - remove the thin plastc covering it. It is barely noticeable. Company even upgraded shipping at their own expense."
2,Garbage,"Dont waste your money on this switch. While it does work, I find it flaky and inconsistent. Sometimes I can wave my hand in front of the switch for a minute before it finally turns on. Look for a better switch."
1,Junk,"As other reviewers have noted, I have tried 4 of these switches and they do not work. I have tried them with 2 8' florescent lights in the garage, and they have a terrible flicker and the sensor only works occasionally. Stay away from these!"
2,Flourescent Warning,If you have a flourescent light then don't buy this product. It won't work. It will flicker. I've searched for a solution but there are no solutions for the flickering flourescent problem.
1,Do Not Buy!,"Purchased mine at Costco, and my Flourescent lights ups, but very dim. It says it good for 500 watts, my two Flo lights are 30 watts max. Wasted an hour of my time installing and now they have to go back to Costco. Does not operate as stated on the package."
4,Works great,"Yes it does require some adjustment while setting it up,as per the directions,but if you do it correctly it works just fine."
3,Flickering problem solved!!!,"If you have a multiples CFL lights hooked up to this switch, the flickering problem goes away if you use one low/high watt incandescent bulb. The switch I have controls 3 bulbs, 2 CFLs and one incandescent (7watt), the flickering problem went away after I removed one cfl and replaced it with the incandescent bulb. It is strange that this a simple problem that engineers at GE with all the resources are not able to build a solution for. Overall the product is fine except for the flicker issue with CFLs."
4,Pipes Like You Never Heard 'Em,"I love bagpipes, be they Scottish, Irish, Hungarian or whatever. But I've never heard pipes play like they do on this album. Ancient instruments intrigue me, but combine them with the classic war-pipe and the mixture is magical. Off-beat rhythym, more intricate harmonies than any pipes album I've ever encountered and unexpected blendings of pipes with bombards and other medieval instruments make this a thoroughly fun album. You won't be disappointed."
2,Remo 16'' Tunable HD-7216-00,"The Drum need to be reinforced. First of all the rebit on the drum is very week they break of easily, secondly the tension bolt tread get damage very easily, when trying to tune the drum. If Remo can come of with a stronger version of the drum it will be good."
2,Great List of Features -- Poor Execution,"This printer looks good on paper but just never seems to get things right. It takes forever to warm-up and print, the ink is REALLY expensive, scanning to a Mac never worked, it would randomly go crazy and print jibberish (probably raw Postscript that it thought was text). All in all not a great experience. Of course, this is now a pretty old printer and newer models have improved upon this. I'm in the market for one now since this has proved to be a poor choice."
2,Can't get out of its own way,"The hardware itself is fine but the driver is a disaster. Every time your computer reboots you have to reload the driver - in all its 395MB glory. This weekend I sat through another install, everything worked fine. This morning I rebooted after applying Windows updates and when I tried to scan received the message ""HP Solution Center cannot run because your device installation is not complete."" It was complete last night, strangely enough.The web is full of rants about this problem. I can still print to the printer from any program, but scanning is impossible. Even if I bypass HP Solution Center and run the scanning program directly (hpiscnapp.exe), it cannot find the scanner. Strange that HP can find the printer but not the scanner running on the same device. If you work from home this becomes a serious productivity drain.Needless to say, I am having all these problems on an HP laptop."
1,To Much Problem W/ this Product!,"I had too much problem with this products. The Ink and print-heads very expensive. After a month of used, the printer stop printing with white and black ink. I'm glad that I insured this product for 2 years at office depot protection plan so had my money back except taxes. Insured this product before you buy it!"
1,Absolute rubbish,"This is the worst piece of electronics I have ever bought. I could only get past the failure of the software by going to the company site and downloading item by item. Even then only one quarter of the functions worked. The accompanying manual was a waste of time and I couldn't get the help function because of the software failure. When I finally got some response from the machine the scanner, the fax or the two-sided printing wouldn't work. The print rate was disgustingly slow unless you selected draft and grayscale only. Finally, to add insult to injury they don't even give you full ink cartridges to start yet it is one of the most expensive machines in its range.Do not buy this product."
1,Do Not Buy This Printer,"Although the printer has a nice list of features and looks nice, the printer is VERY poorly built. VERY frequent paper jams can be attributed to thin and flimsy plastic in the paper feed. Paper guides are so flimsy that a paper jam can easily break them.I am a HUGE fan of high-end HP printers. They are my #1 choice in our corporate environment. HP should be embarrassed to put out something of this awful quality. And to put the word ""Pro"" in the name is just ridiculous. This printer prone to breaking with very light use. I will likely look to Canon for printers of this type and HP for higher-end printers."
4,HP L7780 Printer,I find the computer to be faster than its predecessor (An Epson 4800). The price for the service I hope it will give is great. I never got the wireless communications to work. I gave up and hooked it up via usb.
3,Buy the Canon Pixma,"Had problems with the network function with this unit, although I did not really need it. The Canon is far above the better unit and much cheaper. Very overpriced!"
2,Poor Construction Quality,"out of the box I was horrified at the quality of this computer. It is a real piece of junk. I believe if you thumped the side of the printer with your finger you would break the egg shell plastic It prints right now and was easy to setup but, if there ever was a printer that says, ""i'm going to die prematurely"", this is it. Installing it as a local network printer worked fine, but it sits at a static ip and I have yet to be able to get the install program to see the printer over the internet, from my home Vista laptop; even though i can http to the printer's web interface just fine."
4,Too Much INK!,"I like this HP printer as much as I enjoyed using other HP printers I had. The only thing I don't like is that you have a total of 4 ink cartridges to have to deal with. I miss the one for black and one for color! Now your purchase as various colors are depleted - they seem to deplete at different times! Black didn't last long and that was the first you have to purchase new. The individual cost of the 4 costs about the same as the two would have cost but you have to spend too much time keeping track of all these cartridges.I have used the fax part of the printer and it worked fine. I like the print work that it does and I have not used the scanner! B+ machine and highly recommendedConsidering shipping, tax, and cost the very best buy was at AMAZON."
1,Longtime Owner Says Beware!,"I have owned several HP printers and scanners in the past and have always been happy with them. I purchased this unit one year ago to replace a Brother Multi-function printer that had died. In a nutshell, this printer has the distinction of being both the most expensive printer I've purchased and the lowest quality printer I've ever purchased.o The black print head failed in less than a year (do a search, you'll find this is a very common problem)o The document feeder fails to properly feed at least 50% of the faxes I try and send.o The printer, on a fairly regular basis, starts printing OK and then garbles the print on the rest of the page.o The scanner will scan a few times and will then stop responding (I have an older USB scanner that works just fine so I am pretty sure it is not my PC)o A minor annoyance is that the printer starts bugging me to change the cartridge when it still has about 1/4 of its ink left.In short, this was a terrible disappointment."
1,Not HP Quality,"Very disappointed with this printer. I recently returned it for a refund. The printer failed to scan properly; that is, although every page of an 18 page document scanned properly via the ADF, the final file only contained 10 pages. It's ridiculous to have to verify that every page that was scanned, shows up in the final document. I spent a long time chatting with the HP rep. All of the ""advice"" was useless. This is a cheap printer. Replaced the printer with the Brother MFC-9840CDW which I'm quite impressed with (although twice as expensive)."
3,"The Good, The Bad, The Ugly","I purchased this printer a few years ago and overall, the experience hasn't been horrible. It's not the best either. I will say that dealing with the extended warranty company hasn't been the best either, but I'll try to keep that separate.The main issue is the paper jam. Most of the reviews that you've seen on Amazon discuss that, and I would agree with 95% of those reviews. I've gotten THREE printers replaced for the exact same issue. It's going on six years now, and it's time for me to move on and put this printer to rest.I would say that this will be my last printer from HP."
1,Should be a -5 rating,"I have wasted more than 200 hours with HP Technical Support--what a joke--and have gone through 2 ""refurbished"" replacements. I use XP Pro and this machine will not maintain a wireless connection. Paper jams. Will not print with a wired connection. I was promised another replacement that never arrived. When I called HP about this, HP said they had no record of their promise and that now my warranty had expired. HP has the worst tech support of any company in my experience. This product is a lemon. HP should have recalled it."
1,Worst printer I ever owned!,"This has been the worst printer I have ever owned. I'm a Realtor and I print a lot of material. This printer in 2 years time has went through 3 print heads at $70 each, and it just quit working again because another went out. HP will not support it and i will purchase a different brand today. Do not buy this printer."
1,HP Disaster,"I purchased an HP Officejet Pro L7780, which was delivered promptly, and looked brand new. It is an update of the one I just wore out, which worked great. The software did not install properly. It would not scan. After two extended sessions with HP and hours of wasted time, it got worse. My computer could not even find it. I hired a geek to fix it, which cost more than the machine. It was really a mess. When it got going, the black ink would not flow. Now over a month later and much wiser, I use another printer for any job requiring more than two pages. This thing may work right some day, but it will be my last HP."
4,Vista Problems,"Used with Windows XP, I would rate it 5 stars. Even though the printer software supposedly is available on line for Vista it can not be downhloaded (as of June 25,2007). Each tiime I contact HP, I was told they have a problem on the site. Over a period of a week, still unable to download the SW. First they said they would send me a CD. I checked a few days later and was told that no Cd was available. If I can not get the SW in the next few days, the Printer will be returned."
2,Unfortunately fiasco,"I agree with others about HP. I bought it for a home Office too. I wanted to take advantage of the legal size tray...it never worked!I talked to several Tech support in India... really hard to understand and like someone else said, they keep sending you someplace else or blaming it to something else... finally the guarantee expired and now I have a printer that does THAT>>>Prints...only!The fax stopped working long ago and the 2nd tray never worked. Plus the wireless keeps getting disconnected so I end up using a cable to my Mac..But it looks very professional!: )Don't waste your money...I'll give it 2 stars because it prints : )"
1,Constant Headache,"Constant headache. This printer is supposed to do so many things - fax, scan, copy, print photos, etc. I've completely given up on using this as anything but a basic click and print machine. If only it would even work reliably for that!"
3,Works Fine,"This printer arrived with a defective duplexor (double sided prints got stuck). I caught the problem just within the 30 day period. Called HP and they said they would send another one out. I asked if that it was not the duplexor problem but something else would they send me a new one. They said no, they would send a refurbished one.So I called Amazon as it was less than 30 days. Amazon experience was excellent. They took it back, shipped me a new one (within minutes of ups picking up the old one).However, the whole experience with HP was painfull. Packing the printer was too. Other than that, new printer works just fine."
2,Not yet ready for prime time,"From the specs this looked like a great home-office machine, with better ink economy and a higher rated monthly print volume. Print quality has turned out to be good (although at time sheets don't feed straight), but the machine vibrates a lot when printing. The big issue is networking; I initially installed it with ethernet to the router; however large print jobs (especially big graphics) would routinely lock up the printer. HP tech support blamed Microsoft; in the end I had to install it USB to one of the PCs, and share the PC with other users. Not ideal at all. Vista has been around long enough that HP should have produced a full set of working drivers, including those that support network use."
2,"Great printer, lousy scanner.","I replaced my old HP G85 Officejet which I really love. The G85 did everything well, but too slowly. I upgraded to the L7780 figuring it would work just as well only faster. The printing is excellent and very fast. However, scanning has been a nightmare for me. It's a disaster anytime I have more than one page to scan using the automatic document feeder.The customer support suggest cleaning the componenets in the ADF. Even though it's a brand new machine, I did the cleaning and have not seen any improvement.I work in a paperless office and scanning is a ciritical component of my work. I am now looking for a separate scanner that can actually do the job this HP is unable to do."
1,This printer is terrible and HP blames security software as issue,"HP Officejet Pro L7780 Color All-in-One Printer/Fax/Scanner/Copier (C8192A#ABA)Just got off the customer ""total care"" line with a case manager. He insists that the scanning function on this system doesn't work due to ""blockage in communication"" between my security software and the printer. His recommended fix for me is to 1) discontinue use of the security system or 2) go without a security system or 3) reinstall my hard drive operating system.I mentioned that a LOT of other people are having problems installing the scan function. He said that it isn't a HP problem, the problem lies with either the security system we're using or our computer operating system. OH MY!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,DC,Very Very very bad printer....Paper keeps jamming.... another thing to add work on my busy day>>> DO NOT BUY THIS.
4,"So far, so good.","Installation was fairly simple, did experience problems with what turned out to be the software. During installation, computer kept crashing during installation of software. Luckily we had installed a like product in our office, so we had an extra copy of software since I suspected this was my problem. When installing another copy of software, installation was completed without any problem. Thus far I am pleased with this product."
1,Do Not Buy This Printer - unreliable,"I have owned this printer for almost 1 year. We have spent over 18 hours on the phone with tech support solving various problems. Streaky printing, drop-outs, duplexer not working, print heads not recognized. We are a small business and cannot afford the time to deal with unreliability. If it can go wrong with a printer, it has with this one. HP sent us a free 'replacement,' and the trouble started again in about a month. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER.... find a reliable one!"
5,Great all in 1 printer,This all in 1 printer does all as advertised. It is a great printer. also prints great photos. prints double sided... just like having a print shop in your home.
4,HP L7780 AIO Printer,"PROS: I like this printer. It is the third AIO printer I have had. I have this set up using the wi-fi net in my house, so all three of our computers can print to it and the only wire going to it is power. The large paper supply is great. I like the capability to use the large 88XL large ink cartridges. My previous HP 1215 had duplex printing, so this having it out of the box, and not having to buy the duplexer separate was also a plus. The printer does a good job on pictures also.CONS: Out of the box, the black/yellow print head was skipping one line. After trying the multiple things HP had me do, they are supposed to be sending me a replacement print head. Haven't seen it yet and it's been 3 weeks. It is sorta noisy, but not objectionable when it is warming up.PLUS: Amazon's Price Was among the best I found anywhere."
4,Great all in one,Purchased this printer because I was told that it was economic to run. After using it for over a month in my small business I have found that it is true. The FAX function works well and the printer is great.
2,Printer does NOT work with Vista or Windows 7,This Printer does NOT work with Windows Vista or Windows 7 (wired or wireless). It did work with Windows XP Pro and Windows 2000 Pro.
4,Careful of SP3 for XP Pro,"system was working fine uuntil we installed SP3 for XP Pro. Then lost iner-compatibility between scan, fax, copy and print. HP tech support seemed clueless and we spent several days (and more than what several replacement units would cost)and system is still not corrected. HP is ""working on it"" although they have fixed problem for those using Vista operating systems. We want anoperating Solution Center component back!!! Or maybe we should return unit to HP for one that will work as advertised???"
4,Great product -- no Vista support,"Is been over 2 months since the release of Vista, and this product does not support it (except printing). Therefore faxing, and scanning is not supported. This is terrible and I do not know when the drivers will be released. But the reason I give this 4 stars is because it is an excellent product. HP printers are some of the best, and printing is fast, and good quality. The duplexer and ADF is included, which is a plus. Also the scanner is legal size so it is larger than most. I have had this for a few days and it is well worth the $500 I paid. I use this wirelessly through the network with my other all in one (an older PSC 2610) and it works fine. I also have a PSC C7180 and have to say that is the best photosmart all in one made. HP does make good products. But the warranty is pretty bad at only 1 year."
1,HP Officejet Pro L7780,"I am very disappointed in the quality of printing from this all-in-one-printer. After trying several paper types and several text and photo options I find zero improvement in the quality of the printed results over my prior device (HP7410), certainly nothing approaching ""laser"" like output. I should have kept the 7410 and saved myself over $400. In addition, while the printing speed is pretty fast, there has been as much as a full minute delay for the printing to begin. Even a basic business letter takes 15 to 20 seconds before the actual printing begins. All in all, I would pass on buying this machine and would consider it's smaller but very capable, prior version, HP7410."
2,Serious Design flaw,"Read Gary Myers ""GWMNSB"" review below. It is as he says. If you want to have 2 paper trays, one for plain paper and the other for something else, i.e. photo paper, this is not the printer for you. The printer takes paper for faxes or copying from the photo paper tray. What? That's right. Apart from that it is a good printer with lots of bells and whistles, set up was no problem (took a lot of time), wireless networking was flawless. If you don't need two paper trays I give it a 4 star rating due to the fact that it sometimes has issues with paper jamming / pulling 2 sheets / and undependable paper handeling depending on how much paper is in the tray."
2,Not What I Expected,"I purchased this printer September 2007 with the duplex option. First off, paper kept jamming and crumbling every time I tried to use the duplexer. Additionally, pages were printing with white lines across the paper. Tried getting technical assistance but nothing worked. I actually had to use another printer to print my final documents for my job. The final straw was when the 'carriage jam' error message kept appearing and the machine stopped working altogether. I got no help from HP who simply sent me an acknowledgment of receiving my complaint and never followed. Amazon was really good in accepting my returned item and refunding me. Bottom line, I would not recommend this printer at all."
1,Calling HP Tech Support is as bad as contacting my cable company!,"The HP L7780 is an ok all-in-one printer. Not worth spending more than $300 for and that's only if you get free shipping. The printer can be rather fast when the software is working properly but that's not often. The printer is loud! Fax is ok and scanning was ok too but I now have this problem with a line going across whatever I scan. HP Tech Support is useless. If you get someone that speaks and understands English, you feel like you hit the lotto. But you soon find out that they most likely aren't going to have a clue what's wrong with your printer. The wireless works well for me. If it wasn't for the bad HP software and the lousy tech support, I could give this printer three stars."
2,It would take a great Brahms Fourth to justify a 41 min. CD. This one doesn't.,"I hope Haitink will be gratified to find out that one reviewer at Amazon thinks his late, live Brahms Fourth is world class. Or should that be one reviewer in the whole world? This Fourth from London, in accord with the rest of Haitink's cycle, is mellow, relaxed, and gentle to the point of being shapeless. You could only love it if you demand that there be no interpretatoin at all. Haitink barely provides any. He sets a tempo, balances the chords, keeps the melodies sweet, and that's that. Is the Brahms Fourth heroic, tragic, melancholy, triumphant, or all of these by turns? You'd never know from this placid performance."
4,Moral Life book.,Loved this book. Got it for a college course so we only went through parts of it. I put it aside for personal reading I loved it so much...
3,The Moral Life:,"This book was supposed to be in good condition, well it was far from good, I would have said fair condition, and way more than gently used. The cost that was saved from new to used was not significant. I have purchased used books with a rating that was similar but the condition was excellent almsot new. So always buyer beware."
1,Confused,"I had to buy this book for a philosophy class. I do not like this book. I think that for an lower level philosophy course, there is not enough explaination from the author."
4,moral life,I use this book as a text book for my introduction to ethics course at a local community college. This book is not only great for a text but also very interesting to read. Some of the selections are difficult to understand and are difficult reading but over all it is a great book for those wishing to gain a broad base of knowledge on a variety of moral theories and issues.
4,Very Clear and Pretty Interesting,This was a great introduction to major ethical theories and the excerpts from literature really helped to illustrate the ideas. I went into my philosophy class without enthusiasm and really ended up enjoying it. The book arrived in good condition with only a few notes from the previous owner or renter.
1,Misleading Name,"It maybe just me, but when I saw the title of the product saying ""3 Piece Shelf Rack"", I thought I would get 3 of these things in mail, I was shocked to just get only one. The shock comes form the fact that at the price at which this thing is selling, you can get both the receiver and remote!I bought it at this high price only because I thought it was a 3 pack. If you want just one, the Receiver + Remote package deal comes cheaper. Just go for that.The unit by itself works very well though."
5,Great,"Once again, Ms.Edwards has done well by Mali. But despite myself, I had some sympathies for the killer simply because he was stifled emotionally and murder was his few way of expressing himself. Sick but true. Mali fans would not be disappointed."
3,Not Bad,"No Time to Die; A Mali Anderson Mystery Grace F. Edwards Doubleday 1999 ISBN 0385492472 H.C.This is the 3rd installment in the Mali Anderson mystery series.Harlem Sleuth Mali Anderson is back and on a case that is personal to her. Mali is a brave person who knows her neighborhood and easily connects with its residents whether she is in beauty shop or a playground basketball court. Expect an in your face heroine. Abizarre and brutal killer is on the loose in Harlem and he has killed malis best friend, Claudine Hastings. It becomes clear that the killings are in Malis own neighborhood. As the bodies continue to pile higher, Mali fears for those close to her, not realizing that she is to be the next victim. This book has very colorful characters and it leaves you wondering if Mali will ever catch this guy. Ms Edward's style is free flowing and very easy to follow."
3,Decent but not great,"I thought this was a decent read but not great. I loved the authors discussion of Harlem but found the storyline was predictable. In all fairness to the author however, this was the first Mali Anderson mystery novel that I have read. I have subsequently ordered her other novels. I think that I was at a disadvantage because I am sure that much of the stuff referenced in this book went back to her 2 previous Mali Anderson novels. I look forward to reading those novels next."
3,General Purpose.,"The knife has always been in my pocket since I bought it. The handle feels nice, the linear lock works well and it looks nice. I used it for all kinds of cutting and it performed ok for a little while. As of late the blade doesn't seem to hold an edge as the other reviewer mentioned. The clip broke off and I have tightened the screw that holds the blade in the body of the knife and even resorted to loctite to prevent it from coming out. That fixed that but the edge seems beyond repair and the belt clip broke ages ago. If you need it for box opening great but if you need it for anything from boxes to chafe tape to scribing metal I would suggest looking at others."
3,"Good, solid story, but too happy","I haven't read the rest of the series, but I picked this up in an English Book shop in Valencia to read and relax with whilst on holiday in Peru. For books of its genre, it is good, interesting, my only criticism would be that the happy ending (although there are a few hiccups)comes too quick to cause real reader anguish and suspense."
1,ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!!!!!,"The beginning starts out fine but then it becomes absolutely unbelievable to the point of sure cheesiness and tackiness! Especially that the main character was raped by the ""hero"" (the scene was made as if rape was a normal everyday thing.)of the book doesn't make this book a fine choice to read. Thank God I got this from the library. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!"
1,they didn't get married,I couldn't get over the fact that they didn't get married in the end and were happy to live as pirates even though they had no need to. There was nothing redeeming about either of them
3,Cover art completely wrong!,This novel is set in the 17th century--what is the publisher's reasoning for an illustration of clothing on the cover that wouldn't ever have been worn in that time (not even underclothing would have looked like the dress portrayed)? Odd to say the least--and throws into question how well edited the book is (? ) if they can't even get that right...
2,Silly,"I only read the first 2 chapters of this book and then stopped because to me, it was silly. The main character, who was supposedly a well-bred, quiet, shy bookworm did not fit what was going on with her. It was too unbelievable."
3,I was left wanting,"I have to admit that i found the book very entertaining, but that ending left much to be desired.I happen to love Jane Feather books, but this was a disappiontment.I thought that even though the end was extremely realistic, we read these novels to get away from real life. So, I would have prefered a truely happy ending."
2,Why was she called a Bride?,"I love Jane Feather's other books, especially the whole V series but Olivia's story just didn't seem enough... Who didn't get married back then? And what about the cover? Where was the inner pictures so we could see what the artist depicted them to look like? I like the old style better. I am not sure about reading her next one due to the flavor I have from this one."
4,Would buy from this seller again.,My book came in very good condition and in a timely manner. I would buy from this seller again.
2,Dull and Disappointing,"I would not recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the first two titles in this trilogy. Whatever possessed this otherwise-talented author to write a romance novel with a theme of childhood sexual abuse? Just as bad, the pace of the book is so slow that I skipped to the end and then backtracked. I'm recycling my copy."
3,A bit of a letdown,"After reading the first two ""Bride"" novels, I couldn't wait for Olivia's story, only to be a bit disappointed after reading it. The romance never seemed to be quite as passionate or intense as the in the first two books, and the ending left me ho hum."
3,Good Read,"I read this book without having read the first two installments in the trilogy, so I didn't have any preconceptions or expectations of Olivia's character. The characters and plot were both quite interesting, though I would agree with one of the other reviewers who said it felt more like a Regency novel that had been moved back a couple hundred years and had little real flavor of the period in which it was placed. The resolution at the end wasn't bad, but I think it could have been a little better. In summary, worth the time, but I wish I'd read volumes one and two first."
2,Hated The Ending!,Truly enjoyed first two books and was looking forward to reading this last book in the trilogy. The story seemed to drag a bit. I was very disappointed in the ending.
4,Perfect Ending,"This was the perfect ending to the series by Jane Feather. I could not put it down. I really enjoyed the first book to the series about Portia. The second about Phoebe was a little less than I expected. This book was wonderful. I was glad to see that bookish Olivia ends up with the pirate Anthony. The tension between the two was great, with wonderful loves scenes result. If you like Jane Feather, then this is a definite read."
3,"Good Book, but expected alot more!","I am a big fan of Ms. Feather! I have read all the Bride Trilogy books by Ms. Feather and I loved the first two, but the third was somewhat of a disappointment! It was a good read, but alot less than what I would have expected to happen. Olivia did not get married as her friends had(Was this not referred to as the Bride Trilogy), which is somewhat of a surprise and the ending left me hanging, no real conclusion for me!"
4,Read the whole series....,"Years ago I read The Silver Rose by Jane Feather and hated it. I remember very cruel characters and a weak, downtrodden hero. I saw Feather had just released a new hardcover so I thought I'd give her one more try. Well, of course, I had stumbled upon the conclusion of a trilogy. Still - the book intrigued me and I really liked the characters: Olivia was quirky but likeable and Anthony (with his crooked grin and great sense of romance - didn't you love the beach scene?) was charming and sexy. But then I realized I really needed more background on the villain, Brian, and the other two women, Portia and Phoebe. So I gobbled up the Hostage Bride (loved it!) and the Accidental Bride (so-so) and then finished the Least Likely Bride. Read them in order - they'll make more sense- and I'm sure you'll enjoy the whole series. Jane Feather has redeemed herself in my eyes."
3,Great book dry ending,"I enjoyed reading the Least likely bride, it had everything a romance novel should have except the ending leaves you wanting to know more about how Olivia's life continued with her pirate. Did they ever get married? Did she have kids? Did the three friends ever get together again. What happened in Olivia's life from the time her father gave her his blessing to when they hung the king.What happened to Brian? Did he pop up to cause more trouble?"
2,Historical Romance,"Too much historical and not enough romance. This was my first Jane Feather read. Anthony did not live up to a pirate's bravery when it came down to Olivia having to face her father whom she betrayed for him (he sat safely and comfortably at the beach drawing pictures of her.) Their relationship was not well developed, Anthony was never even properly introduced to her family and they never even got married. Olivia seem to be making all the sacrifices for their relationship while Anthony makes sacrifices for his friends/family..."
4,Wonderful Tale With a Different Ending,"The Least Likely Bride proved to be a page turner. I was completely enthralled by the characters in the story. Olivia is a wonderful blue-stocking scholoar. Anthony is a dashing, sexy pirate who is a loyal supporter of the king. Olivia's dad, Cato, is responsible for keeping the king from leaving the country. The novels takes all kinds of twists and is very entertaining. Olivia's friends Phoebe and Portia are entertaining characters. The friendship between the three sets the tone for the story. The ending of the story leaves a lot to be desired. I feel like the author left the reading hanging."
3,Not easy to read,Detailed with names and military units to the point of making it somewhat difficult to read and hard to follow.
1,Do Not Buy This CD!!! Terrible Sound Quality,"Willie Tee is great but this CD has the worst sound quality ever. To whoever put this out-SHAME ON YOU. This is unlistenably bad, which is a real shame since the music so good. Maybe one day someone with more scruples will release it properly. Until then do not waste your hard-earned money on this sub-standard garbage."
5,The Definitive Book on Railroad Signals,"Extremely well written and illustrated book on a diverse subject. Would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject, either as a hobbyist or practitioner."
3,Railroad Signaling,Broad overview of railroad signaling; but I would have liked more technical detail.
5,Nice Rack,"I've had this rack for several months, now. I like it a lot, but I'm afraid to load it up too much because the mounting holes are a weird distance apart. Consequently, only one side is mounted on a stud."
2,Maybe Next Time,I think the book was a rush project. Ms. Roby did not take the time to develope her characters and the use of the designer labels wore me out! I thought it was a bite over exxagerated and not detailed in areas that may have helped readers enjoy it more. She's young and I do hope to read her writings in the future hopefully showing her developing more as a writer. I wish her the best of luck on her future projects.
3,very LIGHT reading,"Great story-line! Poor character development and an easily GUESSABLE ending. There are very contemporary as well as traditional issues surrounding marriage and relationships and Ms. Roby MISSED her opportunity. By dwelling and wasting space on what color and style of clothing and hosiery the characters were wearing, she failed to clue us in on who Regina, Larry, Karen and John really are!"
4,Excellen read !!! Start to end!,"The minute I picked up this book, I knew it was going to be one of those books that would cause me to late leaving the house. I could not stop reading. Kimberly did an excellent job with this novel. She showed two truly different personalities with Regina and Karen. And she even threw in a little surprise with Regina's husband and other ""girlfriend"". The characters were real and caused me to have certain emotions.Anger and joy (especially when Regina finally woke up and when Karen chilled out) If I can read a book and start talking back to the book when one of the characters do or say something crazy, then definitely the author was successful. Bravo Kim!! Keep up the good work!"
4,Behind close Door,i started reading kimberla Lawson Roby book's a short time ago.and every book has been a wonderful book. she has a gift for writing.
1,A monumental waste of time,"This book features(?) cliched characters, implausible plot twists, and a highly unflattering, though probably unintentional, view of middle class African American life. Is there a cliche that wasn't explored here, a brand name that wasn't dropped? The only thing missing was the evil overseer and the trashy white woman. I felt that I was reading a book written by a high school dropout. It's my worst nightmare; someone with enough ability to write a book with no talent. I can't believe I read the whole thing, but it was kind of like watching a car accident: I had to see the whole thing through."
5,Tha Bomb!!!,Kim's book is the best book I have ever read(here and know) (casting the first stone) I have never been so touched by books!! I am readdy to order Behind closed doors. Kim has been blessed with a very good talent of writng.
2,A decent read,"This book is definitely not on my list of favorite books. The author was not very imaginative or expressive. I found that the writing was simple and ridden with cliches. However, the book eventually drew me in, but unfortunately it ended just when I began to appreciate the characters and story line. The lives of other characters seemed interesting as well and I wanted to learn more about them, but was not given that opportunity as a reader."
1,"FLAT CHARACTERS, FLAT PLOT, FLAT ENDING","I found this book to be a total waste of time. The characters were undeveloped and suffering from delusions of grandeur. They author thinks having a jeep cherokee and a maxima equal wealth and demonstrate success in the black community? Give me a break, the characters were living paycheck to paycheck. I thought this book was a total waste of time and money, I wish I could get a refund."
3,"O.k., but not her best",I just finished reading Behind Closed Doors. It was an easy read. I could tell that it was one of her earlier writings. The ending was abrupt and some of her add-ins were obvious information. I have read her other books and can easily say that her books have matured as she has matured as a writer. I would still recommend Behind Closed Doors to a friend.
3,"Started off with potential, but slowly died out.","With the number of misspelled words towards the end of the book, even the proofreaders must have gotten tired of reading. There seemed to be other storylines that Ms. Roby could have addressed in the book but didn't. Her writing style is characteristic of many fictional books about relationships, i.e., a majority of the book is about the problems, then we get to a happy, but abrupt ending. I must give credit to one part of the book... it allowed the reader to use his/her imagination"
1,GUESS I MISSED THE BOAT,"I couldn't get past the first chapter. I found the writing trite and juvenistic with that name dropping laundry list type of writing aspiring writers have a tendency to use. Surprisingly this did not bother most of the people who placed their comments, but it truly bothered me.Like someone stated she is young and perhaps she will fine tune her skills as she goes along. I hope so. No doubt she feels a need to share her stories, but in that process she must give us something we really will enjoy."
3,"Read One, Read Them All","I started not to review this book because I just really didn't have that much to say bout it. I read the book about 3 weeks ago, and can't remember a whole lot about the book, which says that it couldn't have left a big impression on me. This was a book with good chapters, but predictable and not her best. But as I understand it, this is a remake of her first published book. I do remember having to make myself finish it. This is just o.k. If you enjoy her other books and haven't read this one yet, don't bother. You aren't missing anything. Her best books are written after this one."
2,Too predictable,The storyline was too predictable and full of cliches. More in-depth character development would have helped greatly. I would not recommend this book.
3,"The Immortal Class--Liked it, Didn't love it.","An interesting insight into the daily life of a bike messenger, and the perils faced daily. The more interesting, yet less developed storyline is about the author's belief that there has to be a better way (in every sense). His observation that all of our economy rests upon the labor of minimum wage slackers is interesting. His aversion to petroleum powered transportation makes me want to sell my car and start biking. A great read, and very exciting...he's a little rough of a writer, but that helps add to the book. Buy it, and you'll be excited (great for the greenie hiding in us all)."
5,Completely awesome,"I really liked this book. The author shows considerable skill in manipulating the rhythm of the English language to suit his subject. I have bought copies of this book for my friends, and have read it two times, working on my third.Some people doubt Travis's sincerity, thinking he sees himself as God or something. That's totally not the case. He claims only one day in the spotlight as having delivered the most packages, for example -- (...)"
3,"Interesting, Well Written, but one sided","This is a good book, and a very interesting read. It is well written, as I found myself getting drawn into the stories of Culley's life as a bike messenger. The stories were very metaphorical, interesting, and at time humourous. The book does give a good glimpse of someone who has rejected the corporate driven materialistic society and shows us that yes, we can find happiness without making much money. But the book is very one sided. Culley trashes the corporate way of life and trashes the automobile without looking at the economic benefits that such things have brought this country. He also came off as very pompous. I almost felt as if Culley was insulting me and putting me down simply because I work an office job and drive there every day. While Culley offers good suggestions, he is very one sided and does not see the other side of things, and does not seem to be on the lookout for some sort of comromise."
1,Waste of Time,"This was one of the most poorly written books that I have ever started to read. I quit after 20 pages. My suggestion, don't bother with this selection."
4,Zen and the Art of Bicycle Messengering,"The life of a bicycle messenger fascinates me much the way mountaineers do--they do something to breathtaking, so extreme, so far from what I am capable of. I'll never get any closer to these worlds than I will through a book. I enjoyed reading about the life--the day-to-day aspects. No detail is too small. And as with mountaineering, the reality of being a bike messenger in a big city in the extreme weather of the midwest is much more gritty, dangerous and difficult than I could have dreamed. As for the philosophical aspects of this book, those were not so interesting to me, and I ended up skimming over them, or skipping them altogether."
1,Skip this book,"The Immortal Class is a book with endless potential, but Culley let's his bloated ego and misinformed angst get in the way.Culley's book is about his brief stint as a bike messenger in downtown Chicago and his rage against car-crazed America. During the course of the book, Culley tries to preach to choir about a back to basics approach to modern living. And while that sounds like a humble and inoffensive premise for a memoir, Culley gets it all wrong by blaming everyone but himself, for the way things are today. He has endless rants about the evils of money, how corporations are inherently evil, how the city is too loud and has too many buildings. One thing he convinently leaves out is that the bike messenger industry is fueled by, in large part, corporations.I really wanted to like this book, but it's terribly written, incredibly insipid, and unintelligent."
1,"just not my type, I guess...","I was so put off by this guy's writing that I couldn't keep reading the book. Too arrogant, too trying-to-be mystical and guru-ish. Seems like other readers either love or hate it, I was the latter."
4,The Immortal Class,Great book on a often overlooked and underappreciated group of professionals. Great urban anthopology study.
4,Combination of history and autobiography,"An interesting look at the life of a bike messenger through his own eyes. There is some history of Chicago, Critical Mass and the automobile.Together, these elements make for a book with a unique perspective. The bicycle is shown to be a tool and not used by just the underlings of the world.Some of the information I had readbefore, so I skipped over it.If you did not know the workings of the Interstate Highways, subsidization of automobiles and how little freedom someone on a bicycle has, this is an awakening.If you wondered how messengers do it, this tells it quite well."
5,An engaging memoir which reflects on urban bike messengers,"Immortal Class is an engaging memoir which reflects on urban bike messengers and their activities, and blends an autobiography of Culley's work in Chicago as an artist/bike messenger with a reflection of the status and role of the bike messenger as an outsider/observer of American society. An intriguing study evolves."
4,Good place to start,"If you are new to DNS, DHCP, IIS, and WINS, buy this book. It guides you step by step in setting up a intranet/internet server. Other books explain the better but this book shows how all of them fit togather. One down side is that the author does not go into much details."
2,Not typical of Audrey Wood,I totally agree with the other reviewer on this book. Audrey Wood is one of my favourite authors but unfortunately she's missed the plot on this one. The little girl in the story is whiney and painful and the illustrations are just not appealing at all. Not at all typical of an Audrey Wood story I don't think.
3,"Colorful pictures, but a short story","I read this book as a child, and bought it hoping to relive early memories of enjoyment. In this case, I was a little disappointed. While the illustrations are very engaging, the story itself is somewhat choppy, and the main character has a very unpleasant attitude that many parents might not wish to encourage. On the other hand, the concept is nice, explaining where balloons go when they are released. I still enjoyed this book as a link to my childhood, but am not sure I would read it to my children."
5,Cold as hell H-Town RAP,"Bam is a member of the Killa Klan from houston,Tx which is a group of several artist such as: Street military,Fakkulty and others. Bam's raps are rough and raw dealing with everyday struggle in the H-town streets. Every track on here is top notch and the production is tight as well! If your a fan of hard houston rap(street military,Half dead organization,Fakkulty) you'll want to get this album. It used to be out of print so get it now."
5,ALL AROUND SPORTS CONDITIONING SYSTEM,".... RUSSIAN KETTLEBELL CHALLENGE COMMENTARY This is an excellent all around fitness system. It does everything claimed. It is great for shedding excess bodyweight and cardio development. My strength, power, and endurance keeps increasing, and I find it fun. I think it is a super method of training for sports. Kettlebells are intense and can provide a total body strength and cardio workout within 15-30 minutes. I would have liked to see a few more structured workout programs in the book. Caveats However, before purchasing this book note that although some exercises can be done with dumbells you really need to own Kettlebells to get full value out of the book (they can be purchased from the publisher -- Also, I think to really utilize the kettlebells you need to get both the book and the video. I don't know that kettlebells are good if you're really out of shape, and the current weights may be heavier than some people should use."
1,Not Worth the Money,"I've enjoyed Pavel's previous works, and find his insights and knowledge refreshing when compared to the mainstream; but sadly I can not recommend this book. The Russian Kettlebell Challenge is 143 pages long and in my opinion, the majority of the book is filler--I counted only 66 pages with valid information on Kettlebell lifting (and that's being generous). There are eleven blank pages (fifteen counting the four section pages) and sixteen pages that were a maximum of half full. The first two sections of the book (32 pages!) were comprised of the history of Kettlebells, and Pavel's reasoning on why they're so great. This book reminded me of one of my college term papers were I had procrastinated until the last minute, and used every possible technique to stretch the length of the paper. At $34.95, this book is definitely not worth the price."
2,RUSSIAN KETTLEBELL CHALLENGE,"this book was quite humorous but i thought there would be more how to use it ie more exercise sets,how to start how to finish what should you be aiming for after a month of use etc it was quite poor in this regard as he spent a lot of time waffling."
3,KettleBell- Fun Training alternative,"The ""Evil Russians"" first book on Kettlebell training opens up whole new horizons to fitness.The oddly shaped dumbell stesses the muscles with new angles thus promoting new growth.The Evil Russian training ethods are greared towards strength and cardio all in one package.This book is a good intro to KettleBell training but on the downside:-too short for the money-is for beginners in KettleBells but NOT for beginners in fitness. Novice trainees should start with more basic training.-would like to see more on why a Kettlebell is superior to a dumbell.-would like some intermediate and advanced programs- perhaps those will be the subjects of future books.I would recomend this book to someone who has a lot of experience with fitness training and would like to find new alternatives to keep his interest up.Hint: Get the companion DVD in order to better understand how to do a KettleBell workout."
1,"Skip the book, it's worthless, but the DVD...","...is good. I wanted to give kettlebell lifting a try, so I got the book and DVD. The book is garbage for showing how to lift the kb's. I know excercises can be tough to show in a book, but these are REALLY bad. The rest of the book is just telling you that kb's are awesome and they were invented in Russia. The DVD on the other hand is well done and shows you how to perform the lifts. The DVD also contains the only valuable info in the book, how to set up a workout program. Plus, I am annoyed by the poor editing. Fine, so the info is the same, and its the info we pay for blah, blah, blah. To me, it just shows a lack of respect for people who are paying good money to buy your product. He has a new KB book and video out now, ""enter the kettlebell"". Don't have it and don't know how good it is, but you now may able to pick this DVD up cheap, used somewhere, since it's no longer sold new. Skip the book unless it's free."
1,still waiting for it,I have not received my order so i cannot rate it. I checked tracking and it should be here but it's not. It's been a month. The post office does not know what happened and I have not heard anything from Amazon saying they received it back.
4,great intro to kb training,"This is a terrific book for anyone interested in beginning kettlebell training. The history of the sport and basic exercises are covered in detail. I would recommend this book highly to anyone looking to try kettlebells for the first time. After working out for years I have finally found a method that fits into my fitness goals, with the added benefit of convenience and a fast learning curve."
5,"Once you go RKC, you never go back...","Well, I own Power to the People, Bullet Proof Abs, Relax into Stretch and a Pavelizer. So you would think that with all that what else could a person possibly want?How about The Russian Kettlebell Challenge...The single greatest workout tool in my arsenal, I mean tools, are my 1 and 1.5 pood kettlebells. I know now that I will never walk into a gym again - who would? It is absolutely amazing how much individual accomplishment can be attained using a kettlebell. Simply fantastic. I would recommend it to anyone at any fitness level, in any sport.Buy it, you will thank yourself for it..."
5,how to become superhuman and take it to the extreme,"After reading comrade Pavel's other books i jumped at the chance to read this (considering that i have the video), it was great not only did comrade pavel go into detail about the workouts, he also tells you about the origins of the kettlebell. i have been doing RKC for aboput a month and i love the raw power i now have. if anyone wnats to get into serious shape this is the book for you. do yourself a favour buy the book and video and get into the best shape ever. aspavel say's comrades who do RKC will soon find that they take things to the extreme."
2,"Unique, but not great.","The subject matter here is unique and the only thing which comes close to justifying the book's high price. As with most of Pavel's books, there is a small bit of information stretched out over many pages. Yes, Pavel has a cult following who would give four stars to a blank piece of paper with his name it, so don't be fooled. If you must have a book on kettlebell lifting, this is your only choice at the time, but don't expect much."
1,scoop bowl,"it should be heavier , bowl moves around to much for a handicap person and $8.25 is way over priced for a plastic bowl"
2,not worth the price,too slippery on the table -- got it for a stroke patient and it slid too much for her to use with one hand
3,Not as good as it looks,"Despite the fact that my kids (4 and 2) seem to like this toy a good bit -- I think there are two serious problems with it. First, it was much smaller than I anticipated. Specifically, the part of the coffee maker into which water can be poured is quite small. This means that the kids have a tough time getting most of the water INTO the cofee maker. I think it would be even more fun if they had more margin for error in their pouring. Second, the platic cover that fits on top of the part of the machine into which water can be poured popped off within seconds of my son opening this gift -- and continues to pop off. I thought that this coffee maker would be better made for the price. Despite this -- my kids seem to enjoy playing with it."
2,Unnecessary or Overpriced,"This is the only way to buy Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon on Blu-Ray in the U.S. The two other movies have been on Blu-Ray for over a year. Anyone interested in these movies probably already has those two. This set could be acceptable at half the price, or if Curse of the Golden Flower or House of Flying Daggers were new special edition releases. But at this price point, we're paying full price for these older discs."
2,Crouching- the only one any good here,"I have the Blu Ray stand alone versions of Curse and Daggers....Curse is a story so depressing, you will wonder why you sat through it; Daggers was a poor Blu Ray transfer- the DVD was in fact superior---The Blu Ray version is washed out. Daggers should have been as visually stunning as Crouching but instead is inferior--...the rich and vibrant colors of the spectacular forest scenes in Daggers should have jumped right off the screen and instead was in fact very much a let down--one can only hope that Crouching was a better transfer;"
3,Un poco de decepción,"Me animé a comprar esta edición triple de películas chinas contemporáneas porque la publicidad en Amazon decía que venían subtitulados en español. Especialmente Crouching Tiger. Para mi sorpresa, el dvd no viene con subtítulos en español, a pesar que en la propia caja del disco dice que sí. A esto se le llama, ""publicidad engañosa"" y es lamentable.I encouraged her to buy this edition triple of contemporary Chinese films because the publicity that came from Amazon said Spanish subtitles. Especially Crouching Tiger. To my surprise the dvd does not come with subtitles in Spanish, although in-house disc box says yes. This is called ""misleading"" and is regrettable."
1,"What the deal, yo?!","Greedy Sony's bundling the Crouching Tiger on blu-ray for the first time with these other two movies. All three are great, but I already have House of Flying Daggers on blu-ray and I don't want Curse of the Golden Flower. I ONLY WANT CROUCHING TIGER!Greedy corporate jerks suck."
1,i love these these movies...,... which is what makes it so hard to give this a 1 star rating but c'mon now- it's not even really a trilogy! plus true martial arts aficianados with blu-ray players already have house of flying daggers so bundling this is just a bad marketing scheme. sure it's great if you don't already own any of them but still- packaging them at $60 is not even a deal anyway!i guess i'll look out on ebay for someone who will be selling crouching tiger on its own...boo marketing guys... you fail
4,Nice Chinese KungFu Movies,"I'd own 2 of 3 movies in Blu-ray - Golden Flower and Flying Daggers except for the Crouching Tiger. Both the Golden Flower and Flying Daggers are worth to collect as their fighting are exciting, customes are very elaborating and the country the movies they filmed in are beautiful. I also have all 3 movies in DVD format. Hence, I am looking forward just to collect the Crouching Tiger in Blu-ray now.Cheers."
1,No excuse to bundle three unrelated storylines.,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon deserved a solo release. This is an insult to a critically acclaimed and innovative film and moreover an insult to customers. It is one thing to make people buy a trilogy of _related_ films but these films share only a style rather than any plot. Shamelessly greedy."
5,Get A Clue!!!!,"First of all, Their bundles are to give people who loved ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" a chance to sample the other two really great movies all in one package!!!. I would like to address the people who like to write negative reviews about products they don't own or don't have much information or facts about a product before writing a review. Wait for the product to be released before blasting it. If you don't own any of the films on Blu-ray yet you should buy this set. I believe these are three of the best foreign films that have worldwide acclaim!!!"
2,Release CROUCHING TIGER by itself ON THE SAME DATE,"We all know CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER and HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS are already on Bluray, and most fans of this genre already own those two titles. And it's fine that SONY wants to release them again in a triple pack along with the Bluray debut of CROUCHING TIGER.. That simpy means you could get all three at a great price.But what about the people who just want to buy CROUCHING TIGER? What about the people that already own CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER and HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS on Bluray? I say go ahead and release the triple-pack, but Sony better also offer Crouching Tiger separately on that same date! We've waited long enough!"
2,Damaged Cans,"2 out of 12 cans were unusable due to damage. No return or credit option.Won't buy it again.Hormel Premium Chicken Breast in Water with Rib Meat, 97% Fat Free, 5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)"
3,Charming Book,I read this book over a couple days while waiting for my students to test for their pilot's liscenses. The pilot examiner is a close friend to Stan Brock and he suggested I read it.The book kept my attention throughout.
3,Do Not Buy This For RABBITS!!,You do not buy clumping litter for rabbits.Clumping litters will clump inside the rabbit's digestive and respiratory tracts (the latter if they manage to make enough dust to breathe) causing serious problems and often leading to death.
3,Cheap,"I must have the cleanest litter box in the U.S.A. for the amount of litter I purchase every month. My cats wont use separate pans and yet want the box kept clean, so this litter is affordable for us. Scoops cleanly and does not have any scent. Really."
1,Muddy Mess,"I have long searched for a good litter that would absorb and clump without pieces breaking off as you scoop. This is the absolute worst litter I have used in 20 yrs. Having purchased several scoopable litters this one more or less just became a piece of mud in the litter pan and never really activated with the urine to clump like most other litters of this type. What I also experienced was urine sitting on top of the litter. Tried this on a whim because of the price, what a waste. TIP: I have recently purchased Meijer's store band scoopable litter and found it to be the best I have ever used, even better than Fresh Step. It clumps into a mass and scoops out easily. Not sure what to think about the good reviews here but can say my experience was not the same."
3,Quality Litter,"My cats like this litter as much as the big brand litter and it works just as well. It clumps and scoops well, too."
4,Does what it says,"Decided not to go with a Wireless N product until the final draft is ratified. This Wireless G access point was easy to set up and configure, has decent range, and has 3Com quality behind it. Definitely more expensive than other brands, but you get what you pay for."
3,better than going there.,"Read this instead of going there - there's very little content, even for those wanting to worship at the Shrine of Diana, and what is there is not very well explained or presented - the paintings in particular are very badly lit, almost unviewable in fact. Hampton Court is (just) worth the 15 quid they charge to get in, Kensington at 12.50 is a complete rip off by comparison. Stick to the book."
3,From the good old days,"Back before Ann M. Martin (if such a person exists) totally sold out, she had a wicked sense of humor. This book shows it well, with my favorite scene in all the Baby-sitter's adventures: they hit the library seeking magic spells, and Mary Ann's mind swirls with thoughts of an old librarian beckoning them to a poorly-lit, cobwebbed corner of the library, where dusty, strange-smelling old books lurk, waiting for hapless teens to unwittingly unlock the dark secrets inside. Instead the books are shelved along with all the other books, in the bright Stoneybrook Library. It is a great moment. You should not miss it."
1,Shakespeare's Worst Play,This is one of the worst plays ever published. I thought Shakespeare was a fool after reading this complely pointless play. Do not wase your money on this book because it is completly worthless. A total waste of time to even read any of this play.
5,It is one of the classics. A must read.,"If you liked William Shakespear's Romeo and Juliet, you'll love this book. An excellent book, that only an idiot would give it one star, only a guy who doesn't understand great literature when he sees it. I understand great literature when I see it, that is why I rate this book five stars. Also, if it was possible to give it six stars I would, I literally fell in love with this excellent book. I'm a Merchant of Venice fan."
3,Early writing by DaVinci Code writer...,"Geared towards the female market, doubtful they'll rerelease this one. Fetching big bucks on Ebay."
1,Very disappointed - old software with defects,"This is NOT the 6th level of MarJongg Master. We have MarJongg Master 2 which is excellent and I was hoping to get a new and upgraded version of that software.MahJongg Master 6 is old and limited code with bugs. In addition, even simple things like being able to minimize the software or pause a game does not exist. It also will only work on full screen.Then, if you move your cursor too far too the edge, the whole game moves partially off the screen... very annoying."
5,getting back to the basics,"This is an insightful book full of ""basic"" wisdom that is so needed in today's frenzied world. Learn the secrets of success from these devoted women. You'll gain wisdom from a simpler time that will enrich your life in today's world."
3,I liked the original better,It was pretty good-I like how they did the different ways-but the original was better. Less hard rock and more hip-hop
1,I hated it!,"It should be rated a grand total of 0 stars. Offspring is sick, Pretty Fly for a White guy is sick, and Americana is sick!"
4,"Deep down, a great B-movie","Two things immediately put this movie at a disadvantage: it's shot on video, and it involves a guy getting his willy removed. So once the good taste snobs and the aesthetic snobs took their whacks at this movie, it didn't have a chance in theaters.It is, however, a really enjoyable classic-style B-movie, like the work of Anthony Mann or DETOUR (which is featured briefly in the film). Director Tim McCann has made a couple of great under-the-radar movies, and this fits snugly in with those. I recommend checking this out, as well as his previous work REVOLUTION #9 (which also has a Beatles title) and DESOLATION ANGELS (which also deals with a man unhinged by a secret dealing with his girlfriend). The acting all around, in the lead and smaller roles, is surprisingly and uniformly brilliant.If you can get over yourself, I think you'll like it."
4,"DARK, BAWDY AND FEROCIOUS","This no budget hand grenade rips apart the mold of gutless, brainless and disingenuously politically correct products that have become de rigueur in filmmaking today: our main character discovers that his fiancée has appeared in several interracial porno films; our main character calls off the engagement and abuses said fiancée; our main character has his penis cut off and held for ransom. Sound like an exploitation film? Yes, but this one has brains and wit. Probably one of the darkest films you'll ever see, but the pathos is leavened with a twisted humor (catch 'Daddy Mac' rapping, or 'Dr. Johnson' counseling). This being said, 'Nowhere Man' is sure to offend some of you, especially those who specialize in getting moralistic and self righteously worked up over whatever. And many will be turned off by the low production values, and somewhat thin storyline. But these are petty qualms in what is a gutsy little piece of counter-culture."
4,Great resource I will refer to over the years.,"This is a book I will refer to again and again. Beware--the title of this book is misleading--it doesn't talk about what I would consider real ""trouble"" in school. I think it more accurately describes what to EXPECT in school! I think just about every parent will find their child in one of the situations described at one time or another--especially parents of more than one child.The book is an easy read (typical of a Reader's Digest publication), with lots of hints put in the margins for quick reference. I especially appreciated the insight into how teachers and administrators typically look at common issues. The book gave me tips I can modify. I will feel more comfortable when I approach problems, and I now realize how important working WITH the school is!With two kids, you can be sure I will keep this book handy!"
1,Bland performance,"I bought the VHS version of this the month it came out, and as a long-time student of every bar of the 9th, I hated this performance. At best it was very bland, and the Freiheit substitution totally destroyed what LvB had envisioned. This should get 0 stars for trying to be politically correct."
4,"A Fine Performance, My Favorite B 9th , Buy It","While I am basically a Pig in a China shop when it comes to criticizing Symphonies, I have loved this one for years. It is my favorite performance of The Ninth. I first bought this on Laser Disc many years ago, and spent many a cold morning warming up with it. I was more than pleased when it came out on DVD in DTS 5.1. Unfortunately, as noted elsewhere, the sound and video are not 2007 technology. However it remains Great and it is highly recommended."
4,COP Does Industrial Right !!!,Another COP compilation and they're all good. You can snag this one at a bargain price on Amazon and you won't be disappointed.
1,Don't waste your money.,This DVD isn't what everybody has been waiting for. Forget about the 115 minute running time. It is the same old 100 minute version that we've all seen before. To add insult to injury it only has the English dubbed soundtrack. No option for Cantonese or Mandarin with English subtitles. Picture quality is fairly good 16:9 widescreen but otherwise it's a waste of space. I'm thinking that Bonzai are a bootleg company.
5,The Big Boss,"The Big Boss Aka Fists Of Fury:Saw this on Netflix Instant under the title of The Big Boss,it is a Decent Bruce Lee Film but not his Best,I don't like the Marxist undertones,i.e. The worker being exploited however the Movie I think wasn't going for that,they are chinese workers being pushed around by Thai Bullies,regardless,Bruce Lee is in it and even though he does not get into it per se until later on it is worth watching"
1,Worth every penny,"The free Kindle edition of this interesting Renaissance pedagogical text is more-or-less worthless. The text is botched and peppered with strange orthography; the Latin and Greek untranslated (a big deal, given that this book is largely about how to teach Latin to children).Then again, it's free.One day, there will be nice scholarly editions of etexts -- one hopes."
2,Just not helpful at all for me,Maybe this book can help some but with the questions and work needed with a spouse even though the book says you can do the excersises by yourself its impossible..Im glad I bought it used..I read it..and tossed it..if you have someone you can do the work with great..but it dididnt do anything for me at all...B.W.
4,Married to an overspender ...,I am reading this book to learn how to communicate with my husband about our finances. This book has provided some good insights on how spending is an addiction that you cannot place blame with if you want your marriage to survive. I am learning you have to accept the disappointments of failure and be continually supportive of your partners efforts.I am halfway through and plan on finishing up this weekend. This is the first book of this nature I have read and so far I would recommend it for those that overspend and for their partners.A good read for both parties to even read together to learn how each person is viewed from the other's perspective if nothing else but that.
5,works great!,I use this on my two poodles and it has been the best for keeping their tear stains clean. Works fast!!1
5,Simple Structure That Helps Tons!,"Our cat loves her new playing gym. She's a senior citizen, but still enjoys climbing all over. She still has all her claws & this has helped save our furniture & our apartment! She's quite finicky, so we were so happy when she took to this! We added our own hanging hammack as that was all that was missing, but she does use everything and has found her own ways to enjoy each tier!"
4,SOME QUIRKY STAGING. FINE MUSIC.,"IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT STAGE DIRECTORS FEEL COMPELLED TO ""INTERPRET"" OPERAS IN ORDER, PRESUMABLY, TO MAKE THEM MORE PALATABLE TO JADED CONTEMPORARY AUDIENCES. THIS IS A CASE IN POINT. A SUPERB CAST, AN INTRIGUING SETTING, AND SOME INEXPLICABLE STAGE MANEUVERS, WHICH HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BY OTHER READERS. BUT THE MUSIC AND THE SINGING HOLDS. SO, THE PROTAGONIST IS NOT MARKED BY A PHYSICAL DEFECT, BUT BY A PSYCHOLOGICAL ONE: HE IS NOT A DWARF BUT A CROSS-DRESSER. HE STILL IS A ""MARKED"" INDIVIDUAL. FORGET STRAUSS; THIS WORK IS FAR CLOSER TO LULU AND OTHER OPERAS WHERE THE FEMALE ENDS UP PREFERRING A MACHO TO AN ARTIST. NAGANO AND BRUBAKER RE SIMPLY SUPERB."
3,An Excellent Opera Staged in an Average Manner,"I largely support the comments of the first reviewer who arrived here. I found this production to be pretty much a loss visually. The set with the huge reclining statue had possibilities, perhaps, but not much came of it -- in medium shots it looked like an empty desert. Although I liked Carlotta's costumes very much, all the noblemen in the beginning looked like extras from David Lynch's film version of Dune, dressed in high leather. The central character of Alviano is no longer deformed in this version; at least, not physically. A glam cross-dresser here, he is portrayed in a manner not very compelling to me. All in all, there wasn't that much for the eye. That leaves us, of course with Schreker's music, which is lush and enveloping, but since this DVD isn't all that wonderful visually, except perhaps for Carlotta, I'd suggest you just get a cd of the opera -- the rendition on Decca conducted by Zagrosek is recommended -- and wrap yourself in sound."
3,Good book - bad print quality,The book itself is well written - starts off a little slow but I was interested enough in the topic to keep reading.My main review though was based on the fact that I left the book on the seat of my car on a warm day (not even a hot day...) and the glue loosened up and a bunch of pages fell out. I've never had that happen with a book before! Very disappointed in the quality of the product but very satisfied with the content.
4,Great book! Written for a wide audience. Easy read.,"Dr. Bass has created a very interesting and directly written book in Death's Acre. Written in an unconventional format this book tells the history of the Body Farm, contemporary forensic anthropology, and Dr. Bass himself. Interspersed in the historical chronologies are specific forensic cases relating to the events (conception of the Body Farm, etc.) or research they spawned (larval life cycles, etc.). The cases themselves are very compelling stories, but the wonder is that they all relate to events of modern forensic innovation and discovery. Dr. Bass was not the first Forensic Anthropologist, but between his research and his patronage, he has been a leading passenger and teacher in the modern age of discovery."
5,A NEW SCIENCE,"Never knew how the world of forensic anthropology made its leap into the technical sciences, but this book shows you how it was done. Dr. Bass has created a paradigm that helps law enforcement understand when and how people died, especially when there are only a few bones left to tell the tale. For years I heard that ""dead men tell no tales."" Dr. Bass proves that dead men have volumes to share, if you know how to look."
2,Title is misleading.,I would have enjoyed this book much more if it were about the reasearch done at the 'Body Farm'. Instead we get a flimsy biogrophy of Mr. Bass that deviates from the title of the book. There is also an entire chapter that kisses up to Patricia Cornwell. I found it very watered down compared to other forensic study books. No offense to Mr. Bass and his work.
3,High expectations dashed,"Bill Bass, creator of the real-life Body Farm, is arguably the greatest forensic anthropologist today. But this book disappoints. For less purple prose and more science, try CORPSE, by Jessica Snyder Sachs."
2,Disappointing,"I found the topic fascinating, but the writing left something to be desired. Forensic cases that he labeled as the ""most bizarre of his career"" turned out not be so bizarre after all. In fact, some turn out to be rather mundane. Most of the cases seemed ""rushed"" and ""over-edited"". Believe it or not, the book turned out to be rather boring, mostly due to the overabundance of personal interludes - like when his wife is diagnosed with stomach cancer - sorry, Mr. Bass, but people are not buying this book to hear about your wife's illness. Especially when discussion of your wife has been limited to one or two sentences in chapter two. Mr. Bass should stick to forensics and leave writing to others."
2,Is a little bit racist like being a little bit pregnant?,"I do not question this Author's intelligence or scientific knowledge. I do however, find this author's racial biases at times to be a little more than I can handle. Had he just stayed with pure scientific explanations regarding skeletal differences among the three main classifications: caucasiod, negroid and mongloid this book would have been rated by me as 6******'s However, when one is subjected to hear that the reason there are no black olympic swimmers is because their skulls are a tad thicker than a white person's I get more than annoyed and irritated.I would think the Editor should have been a little more diligent and deleted the more obvious comments."
3,"Good Book, Bad Title","This book is really about the career of forensic anthropologist Dr. Bill Bass not a detailed account of the inner workings of the Body farm as the title of the book would indicate.An engaging storyteller, Dr. Bass shares his career successes and mistakes with the reader. He is an anthropologist and therefore it shouldn't surprise anyone that most of the stories deal with the study of bones (though he does throw a few other subjects in.) He will educate the reader on the skeletal differences between the sexes as well as different races...but you find out little about the research facility known as the Body Farm.If the title of the book had been different I think I would have rated it higher, instead it left me feeling mislead and a bit disappointed."
5,A Must Read For Everyone!,"Though some readers might be apprehensive due to the subject matter that the title insinuates, Death's Acre tells the story of the unsung heroes and an autiobiography as well. This is truely insightful to every person as Dr. Bill Bass shares stories that educate us on the people who help the deceased tell their story. The story of the author himself narrorates with humor and makes for a facinating read. It doesn't take a science buff to read this or be touched by it."
3,Forensics for the layperson,"This book is nicely done with a kind word from Patricia Cornwell. I would have preferred a chronological approach instead of the moving back and forth between past and present. It is an easy read and should not give anyone nightmares. It details some of the criteria used in identification of corpses, but is somewhat repetitive. Dr. Bass is an entertaining speaker and undoubtedly a quality teacher. The book should be read as an overview and the reader who wants more specific information should consult his library."
3,text book material,After reading Jefferson Bass later work I finally read Deaths Acre. Although interesting I found it to be more like a text book than a novel. Without a doubt Jefferson Bass has improved tremendously with each new novel.
4,Grant's best so far in the Black Oak series,"While Black Oak #1, Genesis, was an intriguing introduction, and Black #2 was a bit confusing, I have to admit that I enjoyed Winter Knight the most. Clear, spooky, and more inspired."
1,88 Minutes Down the Crapper,"First, I feel misled by the cast listing, which said Danny Trejo was in the movie. Wrong! He appears nowhere and is just the ""voice"" of El Charro.The movie itself was horrible. The characters were caricatures, the plot (if you can call it that) was laughable, especially the ending, the killings were lame, and don't even get me started with the ""vision/exposition via silent movie.""There were only 2 scenes I will remember (hence my review isn't titled 91 Minutes Down the Crapper): the brief scenes with Britney, whose foul mouth probably garnered the R-rating by itself (but it was funny), and the scene that takes place at 1:17.Note that the only 5-star review here was submitted by the director. I watched this on cable, and I wanted to like the movie, but I wouldn't recommend spending money to rent or buy it."
5,Essential Life Changing Tool,"If you have any form of debt, buy this book!!! It will open the door for the rest of the Dave Ramsey books. They all educate you on how to navigate the financial market and build peace of mind for you and your family."
5,Loved it!!!!,"One of the best books I have read. Easy to follow instructions (simple terminology)on how to implement the plan. I enjoyed the testimonials, they provided motivation for me ( If all these people could do it, so could I!). I am already implementing the steps in order to live a debt-free life. I highly recommend this book if you need an easy to follow system that will help you get out of debt."
4,Strong financial advice,"A two-tape set that takes less than 3-hours to complete. 7 detailed steps to get you 100% debt-free, (including your mortgage), build an emergency fund, fund college, and fund retirement. 97% of Americans over age 65 can not write a check for $600. If you want to be in the other 3%--get this tape!"
5,Money Makeover is the best financial book ever,"Dave Ramsey is a godsend to those who are starting over financially. He gives hope and direction, sound advice. He has been there and came out of the money mess. This is one heck of a ""great"" help to those in financial problems."
3,Total money makeover proven Plan for success,I was expecting something New- and it was just the SAME OLD thing. It was disappointing because I guess I've already heard it all and need to stop listening to Dave : And he's my favorite!
1,Negative,"This is a review of the audiobook. If you like books with positive reinforcement, this is NOT the book to listen to. The title constantly promotes itself, but lacks clear steps needed to achieve financial soundness.The title also brings up a lot of scripture which isn't helpful to the key topic of financial management and can be controversial to those of different religious (or non-religious) backgrounds."
2,Not Yet Ready for Kindle,"I asked for and received a refund for my Kindle purchases hours after making it. The Kindle edition (Kindle 2) has missing type, especially in titles and the graphics used in his book are poorly reproduced and mangled in many cases. It made the book unreadable for me. Instead I purchased the hardcopy."
5,Great book,"I loved Bill Peet books as a child, and I still really like them today. I recently bought the whole set so that my children will have them, and realized that I remember every character and every plot from 20+ years ago when my parents read them to me. They really made an impact on me. The illustrations are cute and captivating, the characters are engaging, the stories and well told, and each book has a meaning. There are few authors who can create such a fine balance in childrens' books."
2,Midline Review,"I'll start this review by stating the Lawrence Watt Evans is my favourite author. Sadly, I can not recommend this trilogy. I heartily enjoyed ALL his books save this series. Other reviewers have pointed out that characters they cared about were killed for no reason, sadly, I wasn't drawn to any of the characters enough to care about their deaths.If you have read another Lawrence Watt Evans book, and are looking to read more of his work, don't make this trilogy it. Read ALL his other books first, then wait for new books to come out as you will be disappointed by this work."
4,"Pretty Good, but a Little Depressing","I picked up this book and the third one in the series awhile ago at a used book store and I just got around to reading it. This is the second book by Lawrence Watt Evans that I have read, and I picked it up because I really enjoyed his collection of short stories, Crosstime Traffic. This book starts out as a fun and innocent fantasy novel, and there are several amusing passages towards the beginning. However, the book takes a drastic turn towards the dark side near the end. Two likable characters are killed off in a rather sudden manner. However I still enjoyed the novel, and I'm looking for a copy of the second book."
4,Light story turns into dark epic....,"The story starts out as a light novel, then, in a surprising and shocking turn of events, turns very dark with the brutal ending of some very sympathetic characters. I suspect that even Mr. Watt-Evans musthavebeen surprised to find his characters developing tragic depths. I doubt if he intentionally started out for this to happen. It was like falling off a cliff while on a pleasure hike...I had to reread some parts a few times until it sunk in that this was somehow developing into a major saga (such as The Hobbitt developed into the Lord of the Rings). I have not yet read the sequels, but will soon. What a rare event in (usually) predictable fantasy!"
3,the messier mean streak,"this dvd was ok . it left out crucial aspects of marks' game . the huge hits as well as that mean streak that mess was known 4 if you got on the bad side of him. some of drama has been drained out of the footage with careless editing of the television announcers call; game 6 vs the devils 4 eg. a better or broader selection of clips from the oiler & ranger days to chronicle ""the complete"" player could have made this dvd 5 star . mark led by example ; stick, skates,& fists"
1,There's no doubt he WAS good he HAD a great career.,Excuse me I just want to let all of you now that 1994 just called and there getting awfully tired of you there's plenty of room in the 21st century and for the many of you who are still stuck 1994 look at the him and the rangers now. And oh yeah in case you forgot last the Canadien to ever WIN the cup was done by the MONTREAL CANADIENS in the year 1993 and 1993 was TEN YEARS AGO.
2,Clips too tight,"The clips are way too tight. Anything thicker than a single sheet of paper requires some significant force to jam in between the clips. I was worried it was so tight that it would rip, or otherwise damage, my ties. And belts are completely out of the question.I ended up using a flat-head screwdriver to pry the clips apart by ~2mm so that I could slide my ties in with minimal force, but it still holds them in place ok."
5,Love the Organizer Hangers,I use these as hangers for my necklaces and bracelets. Easy way to organize and find exactly what you are looking for at a moment's notice.
3,"Ties, Yes. Belts, no way","I purchased this item for my belt collection. Yes, I have wide belts with ornate buckles and narrow belts with simple buckles. Didn't matter. This is NOT a BELT HANGER. It IS a TIE HANGER. I placed my son's few ties on it and great. I gave one to a friend. I still am in search for a belt hanger. Although I just ordered an item, I am cautious about it's ability to help me wrangle my fashion accessories. So, if it's belts you want to hang, move on. The clips are too narrow and closely spaced together to accommodate belts and any type of buckle."
4,Better than expected,"I had accumulated dozens of ties over the years, due in part to my occupation. With my job, I wear ties 5 days a week. I had been hanging them on a plastic hanger, and with each subsequent purchase, those hangers bent a little more, until they were finally more oval shaped. I knew that I would continue to accumulate more ties, so I knew I needed a better way to hang them. I looked online, not really knowing what to expect or even what to really look for. I knew I didn't really want something that took up much space. I found this product online, and ordered a few of them. I now have my ties hanging nicely and orderly on these hangers. I highly recommend this product, and will order another one or two soon, I am sure."
1,Clips are way too tight,The metal clips are so tightly pinched that its very difficult to slip the tie into them to the point that I'm afraid ithey'll damage my ties when trying to do so. So basically the item is not usable.
5,Favorite Hangers!,"This is the 4th one of these I have purchased so what does that say about how much I like it? I got two walnut colored ones, which I like better but they seem to have stopped making them so I got 2 natural ones. They are both very attractive and super functional. I can't believe they hold so many ties! My husband LOVES his and his dad also LOVES his. They find it very easy to get the ties out and to see each one individually. They aren't wrinkled in any way. These make a wonderful gift!"
4,Well made holder for ties & belts,"I gave this to my son for Christmas filled with a dozen ties which he loved. It is well made but as others have mentioned the metal pieces are a little too tightly closed for ties, nevermind belts. I simply took a plyers and opened each piece a little wider. If it had not been for that one drawback, I would have given this item 5 stars."
3,Tasteless Gumballs,"This gum may be named Dubble Bubble, but the flavor is gone in a flash. Not even close to what this gum used to taste like.The consistency of the gum is fine, and this size fits those typical small, round dispensers, but unfortunately, this was the only brand I could find. I wouldn't purchase this again...plus I found the price a little high. The gum is just inferior quality."
1,Spilt spoiled gumballs,When we received the gumballs the container they were in had opened and the gumballs were spread all over the box and something else must have happened to them because they were all stuck together and to the box.... a big mess and we couldn't eat any of them nor would we want to in the condition they were in. I filled out the return form online but amazon.com gave no address to return them to and there was no address on the gumball coated shipping label so I went to a UPS store to send them back to the amazon address but there were so many different addresses we couldn't figure out which one to send it back to . In the mean time it was going to cost me 17 dollars to send it back so I said forget it and took the loss. Very bad amazon experience for this customer. Dont order the gumballs or anything perishable from amazon.
4,tasty,"It's gum in good flavors. Flavor lasts a tiny bit longer than in other gum's, but not significant enough to get this name brand if that is the only reason. This seems to have a more vibrant choice of colors."
4,Paid too much for them,"Well, I know now, that I paid way too much for this. I can get them at a local store for half the price so I won't be ordering online anymore."
3,A little hard,The gum was a little hard can't chew for very long. Was hoping for something easier for the grand kids to chew.
2,the gumballs were all broken.,"Although this item was half the price on line than other candy stores, I still ended to returning it to them because a lot of the gumballs were all broken. The candy shells were cracked and falling off. It is a bit expected I guess with shipping and all but I wasn't about it give this to my nephew with it looking like that!"
5,Bubble Gum!,"I ordered this for my Great Grandson, he liked it a lot! It arrived on time as well!I will be buying more of it later on!"
1,These are the small gumballs ...,"Be aware these gumballs are the small ones. Half of the machines Amazon has matched to them are for the large gumballs.'TheNewMall' that sells these is aware of this fact, but will not issue a return once you order them.Until Amazon fixes the problem and finds a more honest vendor, be aware of what your getting.At the current price, even if your looking for the small ones, your not getting much for your money."
3,Shipping costs too high!!!,Product was of good quality and delivered on time. The shipping costs were way out of line. I would not use this vender again because of the shipping costs.
3,The other Japanese hard rock band,"EZO was the other Japanese hard rock/heavy metal band from the 1980's. Comparisons to Loudness are inevitable, especially since vocalist Masaki Yamada would go on to join that band, but EZO's style tends more towards a sleazier, KISS meets AC/DC meets a case of Aqua Net hairspray kind of sound. Yamada sings in a fairly high pitched, raspy style that is somewhere between Mark Slaughter and Tom Kiefer.1989's Fire Fire was the band's second major label album. To be perfectly honest, this is nothing you haven't heard from dozens of other hair metal bands from that era. Song titles like ""Love Junkie"" and ""She's Ridin' the Rhythm"" tell you exactly what you've got in store. Beyond the fact that they're from Japan, there really isn't anything that makes EZO stand out from the pack. That's not to say Fire Fire is a bad album. I own it, and find myself spinning it from time to time. It's just not one of the era's better releases."
4,Nice translation of Macbeth,"This book is a nice translation from Shakespeare's language in Macbeth to the modern easy to read language of today. As a student myself, I recommend this book to other students studying Macbeth, if they feel they do not understand exact phrases from the play. If you are already good at 'translating' the lines from the play i do not recommend this book as strongly...... but still........ it helped me a great deal with my assignments."
4,"Great example of Shakespeare, yet easy enough to understand","Having studied this book for GCSE, I imagined it to be a typical example of an Old English story which was either soppy or CRAP!! However I was pleased and surprised to find that I was able to understand it with the help of notes. This play incorporates many features used in Shakespearean plays and which are woven to make this a play of murder, mystery, evil, righteousness, and love. THe author ingeniously uses our humble language so as to produce a masterpiece. The story is compelling and although it appears as a nonsensical plot it makes for great reading. The only reservation I have about this play is that the language will invariably put people off. Strive with it!!!!"
3,"Not hard to understand but sounds like a ""Duppy Show""","Macbeth is the most understandable of all the Sharkespares I have read. However, reading this book is like watching a horror movie and tempted to turn off the television but can not do it, because you want to see what happens next. I believe the witches have all the influence in the book. They trigger the bad and confussing aspects of the book. The book speaks of man's attempt to aquire power by the most unfair ways,which do not work out in the end. It brings death, diseases, lies ect. It speaks of unfair competition for gain and the negative consequence of it : - you can lose your friends. Overall, Macbeth is a good book because it has ,in it a message of the importance of fairness, trusting in God and not familiar spirits as well as teachings of the results of chaos."
5,macbeth made easy,My son would not have been able to answer all the questions for his literature class without this book. He has learning disabilities and this made it so easy and enjoyable for him. Highly recommended to develop an interest in Shakespeare and past literature for those with reading difficulties. Wonderful to have the actual text on the opposite page. So much easier for him to understand the meaning of the original text.
2,"Good music, bad production.","Although I enjoyed hearing song's from Willie that arn't frequently played, the quality of the CD is definetly not too good. An import from the Czech republic, sound's like a copy of a copy. Fades in & out- one song will be @ 1 level, the next will be @ another, etc."
4,Cannot eat it plain,"I ordered the 12 pack. I love this option at Amazon! I love regular pasta plain but cannot eat this pasta plain, however, just a bit a sauce and it is delicious. Guess it is the flax seed that gives it the murky-milky texture and taste when plain. I DO recommend for a healthier diet & will order again."
3,There is an odor,"I have two issues.First, after boiling the pasta, there is an odor. I wouldn't say it stinks, but it certainly isn't an appetizing odor; I'd say it reminds me of the smell of cardboard I've smelled in warehouses, but imagine tasting it in your mouth as well.Second, my end result doesn't even look as white as it looks in the picture on the box. I've used up three boxes so far.I can't think of what I'm doing wrong, I'm using the Fasta Pasta boiler (which I also bought from Amazon) which has worked wonderfully with spaghetti-sized pasta and other kinds I've tried, but I can't possibly blame it for the cardboard odor I get from this angel hair pasta."
5,Great for non-egg lukshen kugel,"Due to my cholesterol level, i try to keep away from saturated fat and have a preference for whole grains. That meant my lukshen kugel could no longer be made with egg noodles (and the eggs switched for egg-whites). The problem is, most pasta is too thick for it. So, i wanted Angel Hair and whole wheat. Couldn't find that in local stores except one, and that place had it for something like three dollars a box.I came to Amazon and found this and one other brand. I tried this one because it had good reviews, perhaps slightly better than the other, i have used Hodgeson Mills in the past, and i was mildly amused about the flax seed. (There is no good reason as to why i was amused. :)I am quite happy with the outcome. These are easy to break into small pieces, and the kugel is delicious."
2,fun but ridiculous,"this book by a non-native is fun to read and it has wonderful pictures, but I don't trust the recipes. For example, her only recipe for blueberry muffins (a Maine basic) contains brown sugar. Mainers do not put brown sugar in their muffins! She also commonly mistakes ""local"" and ""artisanal"" with ""authentic.She's also under the impression that there are only ""at least a couple dozen"" lobster pounds restaurants left in Maine. (Her page on them is weirdly called ""Hidden Treasures."") The lady needs to get back in her Volvo and drive a little more on Rte to know that she's off by at least a factor of 10."
5,You can count on Dojny!,"This book confirms Brooke Dojny's authentic place among cookbook authors who have tried to capture, create, and preserve regional cuisines. Her New England Cookbook, with it's totally reliable and delicious recipes, should be on everyone's shelf, regardless of where they live. This book should be too, but it's more interesting to those of us fascinated by the food renaissance taking place in Maine -- which is exciting. As always with Dojny, the recipes are impeccable. They also are true to their heritage, both old and new, and perfectly translated for the home cook."
5,DISHING UP MAINE,"I bought this cookbook for my brother-in-law, but I liked it so much, I plan to buy one for myself. Beautiful color photos."
4,Good scientific review,"Although it reads much like a collection of scientific treatises on the issue of homophobia, there's some good solid research information and it's most interesting to anyone who would be looking for more data on the issue."
5,8 year old loves Shel Silverstein!,"I introduced my 8 year old to these books recently, starting with ""Where theSidewalk Ends"". He gobbles them up and asks for more! I have no doubt we will end up buying the whole collection!"
5,Falling Up,This is a great book. Shel Silverstein books are loved by kids of all ages. I gave his books to my children and now starting to give them to the grandchildren. They love them.
1,help me!!!,"Too much Shel is NOT a good thing! I felt my IQ level drop as I read this book, I wasn’t amused by his style and I’m sorry I didn’t read up on him more before I purchased several of his books. BE SURE you do your research because how he expresses himself is simply a matter of opinion, you just might not like it!"
3,Not as good as Where the Sidewalk Ends,"I grow up on Where the Sidewalk Ends, and wanted my daugther to experience the same enjoy out of reading the poems.. She enjoys reading this book over and over again. I decided to get her one of his other books called Falling Up, and I was somewhat disappointed that it wasn't as good as Where the Sidewalk Ends. I don't regret getting the book, but wished it was a little bit more funnier."
3,"Delightful, but seriously marred by poor grammar and diction","The deliberate misuse of language is delightful, but in many places the sloppy grammar and usage tends to mar an otherwise quality piece of writing. When I present a book to my children I want it to be correctly done because such books become models of language, and children accept them as proper. I don't want to mislead a child for example to believe that a given usage is correct just because it is in an otherwise delightful and well done work. In this book, pronouns turn up in the wrong case or do not agree with their antecedents and diction is totally incorrect, as in the use of ""laying"" for ""lying."" This is unfortunate and jarring to say the least. However, if you are not too picky about these things, I would still recommend the book. It is mischievous, original, utterly delightful in every other way."
4,A Silverstein classic,Another great set of poems by Shel Silverstein! Not only mine but also my children's favorite author of poetry...a great way as a teacher to help students learn about poetry. As a teacher my students so enjoy these funny and easy to understand poems.
5,I'm fallng into a great book!,"This poem book is great! It has funny poems, silly poems, all kinds of poems! Some poems are so silly you'll be confused, and some are so funny you'll fall out of your seat laughing! These poems rhyme, chime and they're so funny it's a crime! So if you like odd poems, then you'll like this odd poem book!"
3,Its Shel as you know him,"It Shel, Some fun, some blah, some thoughful. If you like Shel, you like this. I have to admit, it takes a certain kind of mindset to enjoy it"
5,A must have for your grade school children!,"This series of short poems by Shel Silverstein stretch your child's imagination and make reading with them fun for the parents too! I read a few of them a night to my six year old daughter and it always turns into a giggle fest when I ask ""What if?"" and get her to visualize the silly situations.Some other really good ones by the same author:Where the Sidewalk Ends 30th Anniversary Edition: Poems and DrawingsA Light in the AtticA Giraffe and a HalfThe Giving Tree"
5,"Congratulations, Shel!","Once again, I find myself meeting wonderfulcharacters and illustrations. What do you say,Shel is one of my favorites and sits on my shelf nextto Where The Sidewalk Ends and A Light in theAttic. Wonderful, wonderful work. A greatcollection for your shelf too. Your kids willlove it, guaranteed! Parents too!"
5,Great for unclogging sink and shower drains,I bought this to unclog my bathroom sink and bathtub drains. Chemical drain openers hadn't worked. This product worked like a charm. I couldn't be more pleased.
1,Master disappointment,I was sorely disappointed at the performance of this product. I had a clog and this plunger just move the water around but did not unclog my toilet. I think the product should be re-named. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
2,Didn't do the job.,"Lets start off with the good. I like that it's in white, it matches my bathroom. The little cup it sits in is a nice touch.The good stops there. The neck of the plunger is too big to fit into the toilet bowl neck, and the ""accordion"" section is too long, so it's floppy when you try to flush.I can't/won't return it because I've used it, so it's off to the basement until I have a yard sale.So my plunger search continues (see my review of the Kohler ""Cimarron"" toilet.)The BrassCraft Bellows Plunger from Lowes worked OK, but it's fragile, the neck broke after two weeks.The neck on theG.T. Water Products, Inc. MP1600 1.6 Gallon Master Plunger Low Flush, Blacklooks like it might fit better, but it has the same long ""accordion"" body that's probably as floppy is this one.I really wish buying a plunger wasn't such a pain in the..."
3,Very useful for us.,"This is very useful if you just need a simple and quick audio reminder. It can be a short message for yourself or for someone else in the household. Great for the refrigerator. The magnet is really quite strong, it will not fall unless you accidentally bump it hard. It is also great at the front door if you have a steel door.It is a digital clock, but the LCD display is too small that you will have to really squint and look closer to see the time.Made in china.Cons:- requires 4 ""AA's"" batteries. Make it to use only 2 batteries and it will be less heavy and less bulky.- 20 seconds only. Very out of date in terms of capacity. How much is a meg anyway?"
2,message reminder,"Arrived on time as described. Unfortunately, unless I am incapable of operating this, it only holds one message at a time. Utility is very limited."
3,"A major historical scandal, a minor historical drama.","Joan Crawford is the title character. She is Peggy Timberlake, a lively, sexy innkeeper's daughter. She becomes a favorite of soon to be President, Andrew Jackson & his wife Rachel. She is pursued by more than a few men & is quickly married & widowed. She is a partisan, politically savvy woman aleinating some of her suitors. She finally falls in love with a prominent member of Jackson's cabinent with plans to marry. ""Uncle"" Andrew dotes on her for the kindness she had shown his wife Rachel who died shortly after he became president. Because of her popularity, she is shunned by the president's cabinent, or more to the point, their wives. Enraged, Jackson fires most of his cabinet thus creating a major crisis. Lionel Barrymore plays Jackson & Jimmy Stewart has a small part as one of Peggy's boyfriends. Entertaining little costume drama."
3,Surprising Crawford Role,"What a treat to see a film from this era that chose to depict the stirrings of the Civil War with a beautiful woman in the midst. Have become so tired of the typical musical format and the attempt to unfold the struggles of the presidency and the political firestorm over states rights was a welcome treat. I found the costumes, sets, dialogue, and exposition of then current trends (i.e. bundling?) to be most impressive. Highly recommend for Taylor, Crawford, Barrymore, Douglas, Stewart fans, now that's a cast!"
4,"Great concept, didn't work with my laptop","I thought this was a great idea and decided to get it for my laptop. It didn't work, but it wasn't the fault of the mouse. The mouse worked great with another computer. It worked great. It was my mistake because I didn't check the connections on my laptop before buying this.My advice, check your computer/laptop before buying this. It'll save you from having to buy another mouse."
5,Dufay's Missa Ave Regina Coelorum,"Amazon's listing of the contents of this CD includes a couple of important errors.""9. Ave Regina coelorum"" is NOT an ""antiphon for 3 voices."" It is actually Guillaume Dufay's complete Missa Ave Regina Coelorum - a very substantial work, running about 37 minutes.""10. Ave Regina coelorum"" is, again, NOT an ""antiphon for 3 voices."" It is Dufay's famous 4 voice motet on this text with the interpolation of his own personal plea to the Virgin: ""Have mercy on your dying Dufay"" - a very beautiful piece.The performances and recording of these too rarely heard works are exemplary."
2,The Piper's Call,"Liam O'Flynn's piping style is a refined and stately thing, and The Piper's Call sees him with Mark Knopfler and Galacian piper, Carlos Núñez, Matt Molloy, Sean Keane, Steve Cooney and Arty McGlynn; with Micheál O'Súilleabháin and the Irish Chamber Orchestra thrown in on one track. The best tunes kick up their heels a bit,showing O'Flynn's mastery of the uilleann (Irish)pipes, wrestling with Núñez in the jig-like muineiras; or the madness of Keane's fiddle cutting across The Gold Ring. Like the uilleann pipes themselves, this album very much grows on you."
3,"Nice, but not what I wanted","I found the book helpful in some respects. However, it concentrated almost exclusively on Harlequin type books, which I am not remotely interested in writing. I would have rather spent my money elsewhere, but I hate to pan it simply because it wasn't useful to me. Although, I do feel it should be packaged/marketed differently, as when I ordered it, I was under the impression it would be applicable to other subgenres."
1,BEWARE OF THIS CABLE!!!,I tried using this cable in an apple TV device. It kept on falling out. Now I have to buy another cable.
4,Nice cable for a low price,"I really thinked twice before ordering this item because I was afraid to get a low quality cable. When I received it I could verify that its a standar cable with a strong structure, IMHO a lot more for the price you are paying for."
2,I object to the BS $.01 pricing,"This item's price is $2.99, not .01. Still fairly cheap, but the .01 is a BS comeon. How do I know? If I up the quantity to 2 items, the shipping doubles, even though the shipping cost doesn't increase at all. Triples if you go to 3 items. I purchased from a different vendor because of this."
4,It Works - Great Value,Very thin insulation but I can understand that you really do not need to insulate from EMF interference. As long as you're careful with the installation everything works great. Nice end piece connectors as well. Don't waste your money buying expensive fiber optic cables.
3,Garbage cable but it will work,"The only time I have used this cable is on installations where our customer really should not have a surround sound system. The cable seems to work, but looks like blowing on it too hard may result in cable failure. Of course, if it's what you can afford...."
5,Does the job just fine,"This cable arrived promptly and does the job at $3 just as well as any $25 cable from Radio Shack. The cable is thin, looks maybe a little fragile, and the connections are not really tight, so I wouldn't use it in a situation with a lot of plugging/unplugging or sharp bends, but in my case it just sits behind the TV permanently and works great."
4,great value,bought a couple of these cables for an incredibly cheap price - sound is great over my Denon home theater system. Why spend more?
5,Xbox360 Elite to Receiver,"Perfect connection between the Xbox 360 EliteXbox 360 Elite System Console Includes 120GB Hard Driveand a 5.1 Onkyo receiverOnkyo HT-S3100 5.1 Channel Home Entertainment System (Set of Seven, Black). The connections are firm. (I could have alternately chosen to hook the TV to the receiver with the same cable.. but have not tried that yet.)Note that neither the 360 nor the receiver come with such a cable (though if you plan to hear anything beyond stereo, you need it). Also, (from web research), don't get a 6' cable if 3' will do.Some sites tout the benefit of optical over other choices for multi-channel audio; but as far as I tell with the Xbox, there isn't any other choice to worry about. You either need a toslink from the xbox to the receiver (or TV to receiver) or you go with HDMI to the receiver (cheap ones don't support HDMI)."
4,Good cable and low price,I picked this up to connect mySony PlayStation 3 (60GB)to my surround sound system so that I could enjoy the full benefits of Blu-ray. Being an optical cable there are no issues with signal distortion and the cable operated at the same level as other more expensive cables that I already owned. The only disappointment with this cable was the thin plastic bag that was used for packaging - while my cable appears to be fine I would caution any buyers to check for damage to the cable immediately.
5,"Don't spend all the extra money on the ""PS3"" labeled brands, this cable is exactly the same!","The title says it all. These cables are exactly the same as the ones sold in ""big box"" stores for 10x the amount. Don't waste your money, even if the ones sold under the ""PS3"" name have a warranty you can buy 10 of these for the same price. Save your money, and enjoy the true HD experience."
2,"Do not bend, or it will break","Fit was okay, but it worked for less than a month. I had two optical cables in my cabinet, this one an a more expensive one. This one stopped working, the other is fine. With a little jiggling, I could get it to go intermittently; now, not at all. Apparently a crack developed because of the moderate bend I had in it. Do not buy unless you have a pretty straight shot out the back of your unit."
5,Great Item Great Price,"I received the product in a timely manner and it was super cheap compared to the ones in the store. Been using it for a ouple of weeks on my HD cable box and the sound is great. There is no signal transmition problems like missing sound or interferance. The connections are good enough that the cable wont fall out, but the connection is not as tight as most coaxial connections. Just be sure to have some slack in the lines."
4,Great product...,Great cable (works excellent for my PS3 - Sony Bravia 40XBR2 connection). Quick delivery too.
4,Good Product,"Prompt service, great price, works as expected, a very good experience. Considerable savings over the price over the price of one purchased locally."
5,Works great with my Tivo,Using it for my digital audio from my Tivo to my AVR. Works great... 5.1 and HD is a great combination.
2,Tripp lite A102-02m,"The Cable works OK but what they send me was not tripp lite, but NSI which is made in china with same model number, i didn't return because the price was very cheap"
3,cable review,It works overall as designed. The only complaint is that cable does not fit snugly into receiver and into PS3.
1,Poor Connection,"These cables are cheap and it shows. They don't ""snap"" into the port to make a positive connection like other cables I have used, and easily fall out with the slightest touch. I plan to send the two I bought back for a refund."
1,keep looking,"not only did the item not arrive, they wouldn't refund my money. I had to contact my credit card company to get reimbursed. Its been 15 business days since I ordered it and I still haven't got it even though they said they shipped it."
5,Why pay more??,"I purchased this cable to replace one of my other optical cables for my PS3 that had been crimped when I moved. I was a bit hesitant to purchase it seeing that it was one of the lower priced cables I saw. I always had the philosphy that you get what you pay for, and was happily wrong in this case! It may not be as durable as my monster cables that I bought retail at Radio Shack for around $20 a few years back, but it works perfectly. In fiber optics, they either work or don't work. Unless you are planning on switching this cable to different components on a regular basis it works fantastically. Crystal clear and well worth the money. Stop paying for overpriced cables that wont make a difference!!"
3,Digital Optical Cable,Very good price. Fast shipping. Shipping charges is a little steep considering it is coming from less than 10 miles away.
2,Cable was fine but arrived 10 days late,The cable itself was fine and works properly. I didn't receive it until over a week past it's scheduled delivery date. I won't be ordering from this vendor again.
1,Worthless,"Based on other reviews of the ""good value"" of these TOSlink cables, I ordered 3. Unfortunately, I'll never know if they work or not, because the plug is so insubstantial that it will NOT stay in the optical connector on any device with which I tried it. I've used many Tripp Lite products in my home and office and have always been satisfied. Wow, is this ever a disappointment! No wonder they're so cheap"
2,Disappointing,This product was not very good. The picture was to bright and some of the word in the movie were all mumble together so you couldn't understand what they were saying.
4,Nick without Nora or Asta,"This is a delightful film for fans of William Powell and the Thin Man series. In this outing, he is Philo Vance, a different sleuth, but with all of the Nick Charles charm. His leading lady is the stunningly beautiful Mary Astor, of Maltese Falcon fame. This movie has everything fans of 30's movies love: trains, ocean liners, gorgeous gowns and interiors, men in hats. Vance even has a doggie sidekick, a plucky Scottie. The locked-room problem is gotten out of the way fairly early, so it is more matter of determining which moustachioed, hat-wearing character did the deed. Truthfully, the plot of The Kennel Murder Case is more plausible than that of the original Thin Man. Highly enjoyable, and the source print for this DVD was surprisingly good."
3,"Great movie, but...","I love this movie, sort of an early Nick Charles adventure, before he got married, without Nora. I wish there were more Philo Vance movies available, but alas, I have not found any. But the condition of the print is quite poor. I recorded a better print off of PBS!!Still, I would recomend this to all the diehards."
5,A classic murder case,"As with all good murder cases there is some nasty person (Archer Coe) that makes everyone he comes in contact want to murder him. You guessed it he apparently committed suicide in a ""locked"" room.Of course Philo Vance (William Powell) does not believe it and has to unravel a complex ""Who-done-it"" and how?This film is based on a novel by S.S. Van Dyne. And even thought it has William Powell and Mary Astor, two well known actors in it they are not a couple in the movie.The acting is well done. And you will find many of the elements (character portrayal, gimmicks, and subplots) in later movies.The Dragon Murder Case: A Philo Vance Mystery (A Scribner Crime Classic)"
3,"Sound good, picture quality bad","If this is the ground-breaking 30's detective movie they say it is, the DVD deserves more care as to quality control. (Please note that the distributor is not the studio that originally produced the film.) That said, the mystery is entertaining; and the acting is solid. However, the DVD picture quality is poor and is a major distraction. UCLA needs to get to work on this one, fast! The sound is surprisingly strong for most of the film, except in a couple of places where it cuts in and out. I will keep this DVD in my collection, but I cannot recommend it to any one to buy."
2,GREAT DETECTIVE - MARGINAL PRINT,Great story with a great actor. Too bad Alpha didn't care enough to find a good print... sound is okay. I would not buy from them again.
1,Wonderful classic whodunnit-lousy copy,"I was looking forward to a sharp, clear DVD of one of my favorite whodunnits but instead I wasted my money with Alpha Video on something that looks like a poor copy of a VHS! Do yourself a favor and look for a good, remastered version of this movie from someone else and enjoy! The story and plot are well worth it!"
4,"Great, but not a good introduction to Fugazi","Usually, it's pretty annoying when a good artist releases an EP of wanky demos, four-track experiments, and outtakes, but Fugazi pulls it off well. The tracks here are mostly enjoyable, and a few are great (the instrumental version of Guilford Fall still hits me harder than the album version). It's also fun to hear Fugazi goof off, since they can come off as overly pious and serious sometimes. My only warning is this: do not buy this if you are not already a Fugazi fan, because it will not give you a good sense of the band. Start with 13 Songs, Repeater, or Red Medicine."
5,Appreciation,"Listening to this album now I can see that it is my favourite by Fugazi. The mix and match compilation of all their demos leads you down the path into appreciating their later albums. If you like Fugazi's background tracks, the music beneath the lyrics then you will love this album, watch out for 12 and 17."
3,"Song #1 is not a ""pink frosty demo"" song","Hey Jem...nice tribute of the 'Electric Ladyland' album cover! Verrrrrrry subtle. By the way, are you one of the Cohen brothers? 'Raising Arizona' was great! Your next documentary should be about John Goodman's band. That would be AWESOME!"
2,Get this last,"I just find it hard to get into a CD that is primarily a bunch of unreleased demos and live tracks. Unlike other bands like Pavement, Fugazi's best songs always made it onto the albums. There are no gems here, just raw versions of songs that sound much better in their final incarnations. You are much better off getting all of the other studio releases first. If that is not enough Fugazi for you, buy the video and watch that. If you really like it, then come back and buy this. You will probably really enjoy it. This should be the absolute last thing in the Fugazi catalog you buy."
5,I'd give it a 10 if I could,"This book is virtually perfect. It delivers the most fabulous desserts to your kitchen -- and your imagination -- in the most inviting way. Nothing feels beyond the home cook's abilities, and it gets you thinking ""what about this?"" I've only made the chocolate biscotti, and they're such a huge hit! I can't wait to make more, but still, I'm happy to read and dream...."
2,Looks wonderful but recipes haven't turned out spectacular,"I purchased this book based on the reviews and while I agree that the combinations are innovative and the pictures are great, I have not been impressed with the results. The instructions are clear and pretty easy to follow but I've made three things from this book already and they all turned out either too sweet, too rich or just so-so. I will continue to try recipes from this book and I am hoping I have better results."
2,Not as nice as it looks,"The book looks great, with gorgeous pictures and wonderful titles that would inspire any cook. Too bad the recipes didn't deliver as promised.I tried four recipes in here one weekend (trying to pick one for Thanksgiving) and every single one turned out really badly.-The white chocolate espresso tart: Crust was impossibly dry and crumbly. White chocolate cream was too thick to drain through a cheesecloth as the directions asked.-Apple tart tatin: The caramel hardened into a hard candy shell on the bottom of the dish that was too difficult to break through.-Sour cherry and pear crisp: The wine that the cherries soaked in overpowered the dish, turning everything into a pink mass.-Citrus tuiles: These were just disastrous. They burned around the edges and stuck to the pan."
3,The Last Course: The Desserts of Gramercy Tavern,"The publication is well designed and the recipes are easy to read and follow, however there aren't any dessrts that couldn't be found in any number of dessert books at a much cheaper price."
5,SO GOOD!,I love this restaurant & have always loved the desserts. I was skeptical about buying the book because most restaurant cookbooks I have purchased never have my favorite recipes from the restaurant. This one has them all & then some!!! My favorite is the warm chocolate ganache cake!!! This cookbook is great & the recipes are easy enough to follow!
5,Incredible Edibles,"I was so totally amazed by this book! I like to read and peruse cookbooks as a hobby and I definitely didn't expect this one to be anything above the ordinary. So many celebrity pastry chefs do their own books these days and for the most part, you can't really use the books because the recipes are so complicated and unrealistic. The author of this book did make the same indulgence but she only put it in the last chapter (a short one at that). It certaintly wasn't the focus of the book. This book shows recipes that could actually be prepared and had beautful photographs as well. There are dessert ideas I would of never thought of and I swear, I will never think of vegetables in the same way again. Truly, an outstanding book!"
1,Waste of Money,"Folks, if you are a consultant and you think you can pick up this book and learn something about APO, you are dead wrong.Don't waste your money on this book. Just stick to SAP documentation on APO. It teaches you nothing new about APO or supply chain in general.If you are implementing APO, you may derive some minor value from this book. But again your best bet is to get the SAP APO documentation and review the APO 3.0A release notes on sapnet."
2,Book should include more technical details,"This book is of not much help if you are working with SAP-APO intigration. Book does not cover any technical details.Looking to its contents , I feel , this book is very expensive.Price of this book should be reduced to $15/-.SAP-APO online documentation will be more useful than this book.Hope we will find more technical details in next publication.Regards - Pras, UK"
3,Pretty good book,I am 6 and it was a good book but hard to follow. It went from one subject to another. Some people probably love this book but I didn't care for it
4,"Not his best, but a good read!","Well, compared to a several books by Lloyd Alexander, this book isnt nearly as interesting or fun as others. However, it's still a very good book and, as all Lloyd Alexanders, a great read with very cool characters."
2,A little deffective,We bought 2 sets one set for my wife and other for me. They are a bit pricey considering what they are made from. Also the grip on 1 of the sets slides back and forth creating a jarring of the wrist as you move from back to forward motion and then back. The other set does not have this problem. I wonder if with time the second set will develop this same problem. I used a different brand at the Y before we moved and they seemed better quality.
3,received only half of our order of 2 dumbells,"We ordered and paid for 2 pair of dumbells, but only received one pair. Where is our other pair? We liked the one pair that we received, but now our order is closed and we still need the other pair."
5,Aquatic Dumbells,"They're nice. They're not too bulky or long and fit nicely in your hands. My guess is that the ""Medium"" size provides about 5-10 lbs of resistance, depending on the depth of the water. I'm very happy with them."
4,Great Workout,The aquatic exercise dumbells are very good quality. I do my own water workouts and have used them extensively as part of that regime. I ordered the medium size and they give very good resistance. Would buy again.
3,Aquatic Dumbells,I feel that this product is over-priced. I expected it to be made of a high quality foam material but instead it looks like something used to pack an item for shipping. I just hope they hold up to the water and normal use.
2,Not satisfied,Not what I expected too light does not really do anything Have tried other light hand bars and you get a good workout but not with these onesPat Deluca
3,Aquatic Exercise Dumbells.,Would have been more satisfied if they would have included basic exercise instructions with the product. If ther were susppose to be instructions with it they weren't included.
3,Too light - My mistake.,My mistake. Should have purchased heavy weight. The ones at water aerobics at the Y were/are much more sturdyand substantial.
3,CHANGED!!!!,"THIS WAS A GOOD READ I MUST SAY, IT JUST LETS U KNOW AS MUCH AS U MAY WANT TO GET AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY U MAY STILL NEED THEM AT THE END."
4,"It had a good plot, but it also had some parts that didn't make sense to me ...","Overall, I thought this was a good read. The writing style was good, but there were certain parts of the story that made me scratch my head and say ""WTF?"". I would recommend it."
3,Average Read,"The club members thought that this was an average read. We did not like Raedella! Some points in the book were very unrealistic. As in other books, Rae was in denial and as real women, we too are sometimes in denial (as it pertains to relationships). We decided that if there was a sequel, we would not read it."
5,Fantastic Read!,"Easy read, Lots of twists and turns, pays homage to the traditional black matriarch, couldn't put it down!!"
5,There is No Place Like Home,"This story was awesome!! From the beginning, Raedella Rollins, Rae, is a person that you immediately do not want like. Yet, you can tell by her harsh, wanna-be attitude that there is more to her story than she lets on. Raedella leaves her family, in Sweet Poke, Ar., for what her fairy tale life. However, the fairy tale quickly begins to unravel.Billingsly will have you laughing and crying. You may even find a relative or two in the story. Billingsley cleverly discuss topics such as teenage pregnancy, drug abuse, self-esteem, family values, love, forgiveness, love for family and of the Creator. Rae learns that what she craved she already had she just had to see and appreciate it.Can't wait to read the sequal... there were a few relatives that I know have stories to tell.Blessings!!"
3,Predictable but interesting,"Though the plot was a little predictable, it was still very interesting to see how the story would end."
3,A Diva and her stank family,"I know I reviewed this book already, but I do not see it here. I thought this book was an average read. Nothing spectacular about it. Small town girl, dreams big, makes it big, wants to leave her old life (including her family--who by the way had several nasty and using members) behind. Obviously the cards of the book won't be in her favor. They threaten to storm her job to make her see them, they always borrow money, they want her to help get murderous cousins out of trouble...can you see where it's going? Meanwhile, she has a philandering fiancee' and trouble at work. All makes for a predictable story. I will not spoil the story by saying how it ends, but if you must read, rent from the library."
4,Beethoven? Boring?,"You'll want to take this in small doses. Nothing at all wrong with the playing of the Orfeo Baroque Orchestra (or the recording), but the music can sound repetitious and, thus, the listening experience begins to feel tiresome, even monotonous (yes, I suppose, even Beethoven can seem that way sometimes)."
2,Just a bulky summary,"For the most part, this book is nothing but lists of charms. Normally that'd be a great thing (especially since all the books aren't out yet) but the description and layout is so poor that its not worth it. The Abyssal section does nothing more than print out a name and tells you to refer to the equivalent Solar Charm. Better to bide your time for the specific source book you are interested in."
2,eh..,"its okay.nothen very cool about it or in it,except for the part on the minor gods and some cool artifacts at the very back of the book. it mainly sums up all the core books and gives them a slight refresh to the new rules. i gues if you want to take all you old rules and charms to the new rules its usefull.if your like me and take the rules with a grain of salt,then its just somethen nice to fill that collection and bookcase.have fun."
4,Keep this one in your range bag,"Aside from being a very entertaining read (excellent for those endless waits at the benchrest range), ""Black Magic"" is a comprehensive review and analysis of the use of the AR-15 in high precision (mostly competitive) shooting.I found Feamster's ""history of the mousegun"" to be informative not only from a curiousity standpoint, but also as a nice primer on the modifications and changes that made the AR-15 competitive.The advice offered for accurizing the AR-15 is indispensable, and well organized by function. Not only are the functional characteristics of the rifle addressed, but advice is offered on targets, powder & ammunition, and application-specific tips on varmint hunting & law enforcement uses.There is no question that this book is highly partisan, but Feamster is fair enough to cover some of the advantages of the M1 & M14 in comparison with the AR-15."
4,Very Informative,"Great book, has a lot of useful info on getting started and familiarizing yourself with the intricacies of the AR15 in competition."
3,For the long range AR shooter,"Some of the information was very useful (especially with regard to ammo and some equipment), but not real current. Also, author's writing style was a bit distracting. Too many !!!!!!s and capitalized words (for example ""WHEW!!!!!"", ""EGADS!!!!"", ""GRIN!!!!!, ""AH HA!!!!!"". A little bit of this goes a long way."
1,waste of money,"no results, waste of money I used it for months..very greasy and oily. Do not buy this product unless you want breakouts."
4,Inventive Twist on Oceanic Animals,"I bought this book for my son, who is five, and he loved it. He enjoyed looking at the pictures of animals he's fascinated with, and I liked the fact he's learning something at the same time. As a former homeschool mother, I wish I had known about this book earlier, as it would fit right into a unit study about oceanic life and sea animals. It even would have fit in with a study on taxonomy for my older son (aged 9), as he could have read the book and then classified the animals into their appropriate categories.We all loved the book and it continues to be read again and again in our home."
4,easy does it,This is a very efficient easy to use product that leaves my hands just soft as babyskin
5,True to the original in both spirit and form,"Though excited about this fresh translation of the first book of the Masnavi in a rhymed and metered format, I must admit I was a bit skeptical at first about its faithfulness to the original. Recently, though, I had the chance to go over portions of the translation with my father, who is very well versed in Farsi and in Rumi's works, and we were positively surprised by how much this rendering is loyal to Rumi's masterpiece in both spirit and form. May Mr. Mojaddedi be inspired and energized to carry out the monumental task of making the Light of all six of the Masnavi's books available to the English-speaking public in its original and delightful rhymed couplet form."
1,Trite and tiresome translation.,"Though fun for the first few pages, the terrible rhythm it sticks to, and the degree to which it is willing to mangle a sentence to preserve a pointless rhyme scheme and aforementioned rhythm soon cause you to flip to the back of the book to check how many pages of this drivel you are going to have to endure. Although I persevered to the end, if I had it to do over again, I would have put it down at that point, and gone and bought another translation. I am still working up the courage to attempt another translation - I would hate to find out that Rumi was this annoying in the original.Seriously - pick a different version."
5,Great product!,The book came right away and in perfect condition! I would recommend buying for a great read too. Thank you!
4,Good but not Quite There,"The translation is a little off on some parts, in my opinion, but other than that it is good. It is a mid-level book of Sufi Anecdotes written in symbolic couplets. It is not for beginners. One should, before reading this, study theology and jurisprudence (the Creed of Imam Tahawi and Maqasid are good for theology and jurisprudence). On top of that, The Book of Illumination and al-Hikm (Sufi Aphorisms) by Imam ibn 'Ata'illah should both be read before delving into the Masnavi. Otherwise the reader will not understand anything."
1,Too Much History and Not Enough Mystery,"This book was extremely slow and boring. It just goes on and on about Mali walking her dog at night into the streets of Harlem with excruciating details about every single store, house, and historical symbol about each street. She keeps asking the same questions to different people and gets nowhere. She supposedly has a boyfriend, Tad, that's on the police force but his character is hardly in the book. You would think by this being a murder case the dialogue between these two would be massive.Overall, if you are looking for a Harlem history lesson then get this book. If you are looking for a real mystery that will keep you on the edge of your seat then do not read this book ""by any means necessary""!"
5,Quisiera darle mas de cinco estrellas,"Lo que ocure con muchos cantautores al pasar de los anos parece no haber tocado jamas a Ricardo Arjono y bendito sea eso. Sus canciones no tienen igual en cuanto a tema, realismo y pura emocion. Tomen por ejemplo la cancion,""Tu Reputacion"". Con unas pocas lineas, el levanta el imagen de una mala reputacion y la convierte en una bendicion. Bravisimo!"
1,I can not believe it,"C’mon guys… This CD is the worst work of copy from the best music written in Spanish… It’s just like Britney Spears taking verses from Dylan, Cohen, Nash and singing them as if they were her own, but adding them a lot of trash lyrics…"
5,"Buy it for the music, listen over and over for the lyrics","While Arjona's music is very enjoyable, it is the lyrics which have caused me to find his songs thought-provoking for the three years I've had the tape. Few love songs in any language can equal the depth of feeling in ""Tu"", the healing power of ""Tu reputacion"" or the devastating sadness of ""Te acuerdas de mi"". If you're learning Spanish, use this CD to practice listening - you won't regret it, and you're likely to end up singing."
4,Good. Legible numbers would make it excellent,"This is a good, reliable metronome, sold at a very reaosnable price. It works well even when it is turned on its side and used as a page weight. Unfortunately, I must use a magnifying glass--not just reading glasses--to read the numbers on the dial. They are far too small and are especially hard to read because they are set in white type on a red background."
2,Not durable,The audio on this unit failed after about a year's use. It performed fine until that happened.
2,ok but kind of annoying,"its a basic metronome. the ""click"" sound is more of a modified beep and it isn't very loud even turned all the way up. I returned this item."
2,Blinking red light,I personally do not like this metronome because of the red light that flashes each time it sounds. I find it distracting and headache inducing. If this would bother you look for something else.
2,Worked great until the switch broke,"We bought this metronome and my kids loved it. They used it daily for piano practice. It worked great for a few months until one day the switch snapped as my son was using it. The switch is really tiny, and it was a pain to turn on and off even before it broke. The switch broke in half for us, just where it sticks out, leaving the remainder of the switch flush with the unit.I kept the packaging for a bit, but then had thrown it away, so I have not contacted the manufacturer. I am looking for a better longer term replacement. In the meantime, I managed to turn it back on again and we've been using it the last month or so by attaching and removing the battery. (Not ideal, but it works!)"
5,The best.,I have an old Seiko SQ-50 from years ago and my ears could not stand the irritating click. The click caused a pounding in my ears. I tried the current generation SQ-50 and the click sound is much mellower especially with the volume control and the two tone settings. And it can get plenty loud enough at top volume setting. The dial design is not as clear as the old one but I am getting used to that. The pointer is hard to see but I made it black with a permanent marker.
4,metronome,I bought the metronome to use in Spinning classes. It's easy to change bpm and visible to class participants. The only negative I have found is the 4 bpm range between settings.
5,Deep sound which can be heard through the sound of the instrument,I bought this after hearing an older seiko at my lesson. When practicing the fiddle I can't hear the digital beep sound produced by most other metronomes in the price range over the sound of the fiddle. The metronome has a deep almost wooden sound that I can hear when I'm playing. The dial is easy to move when you are trying to incrementally increase your speed. The overall result is that I am concentrating on my playing not on the metronome.
3,Jerry has done better,"The first song on ""Fresco"" is very good, but after that these are pretty much generic sounding salsa, not very creatively arranged. I have discovered that in Latin Music, the arranger is as important as the singer, and you can often predict what an album will be like by familiarizing yourself with the the producers and arrangers that frequently show up. That is the problem with ""Fresco"", the salsas have a generic, work-a-day sound to them. When this happens, so does the singing. Jerry Rivera is a wonderful singer, but does little to inspire here. Some of the songs are by the very fine Ramon Sanchez, but this is not his best work (see Caro de Nino for that).A year after Fresco, Jerry released Ya No Soy El Nino Aquel, an outstanding CD featuring some of the superstar music producers of the Latin world, and Jerry's singing rises beautifully to the occasion."
4,simple book with fun stickers,My 6 yr old daughter loves to have this book read to her. It is a very simple story with beautiful illustrations. The book includes some jewel stickers that the child is ask to place on different items on each page. There are also quite a few stickers left over for the child to use on other projects.It's not earth shattering literature but it is worth the price if you have a ballerina princess in your life.
3,nice book,we bought this book for our grandchildren and they love the story and stickers as a bonus. very nice gift for the little ones.
3,CURZON,"Nice book. The only problem is that it is said that there is a map inside in the original version, but in the reedition they forgot to include it."
5,JUST A PHENOMENAL BOOK.,"Don't let the title fool you. This book is just as applicable to the Believer as it was when it first written in 1978, and then revised in 1993. Not only does it explain what charisms are and how they work in a truly Holy Spirit filled church, it makes the reader hold his church up to Jesus Christ's and Saint Paul's standards for good churches. Hmmm, I wonder how many of them there are really measuring up to those standards???"
5,An invaluable resource,"The 3rd edition of this book starts off with an anecdotal story that clearly demonstrates Rick Stiggins philosophy and practical understanding of student-involved and classroom-based assessment practices. Throughout the book, he makes reference to this story as he explores it's meaning and implications. The first four chapters and the two main organizational charts are the essence of the book. The rest is there for educators to explore as they need it. I have used this book with several hundred preservice teachers and many, many inservice teachers. On it's own, it can look daunting, but taken in small bits, and discussed, thought about, tried out, it is a wonderful resource for any educator truly interested in UNDERSTANDING why student involvement in assessment and evaluation does make a major (and measureable) difference in student work and then actually IMPLEMENTING it in a classroom."
4,A Good Slice of Cop Life,"David Ziskin writes with the insight of someone who has been there, because he has. In addition to the humor and pathos of any 18 years of street patrol in a good size city, he saw a dramatic evolution in technology, though not in management. From harmless, but highly eccentric ""street characters"" through one of the worst mass murders in US history, it's all here. Anyone interested in police work should read it. Everyone except aspiring police administrators will enjoy it."
1,the real police,"centers more around the history of police than the real effects of police staying on the ""beat"". I think the book rambles in different areas and does not center on the idea of policemen staying in ""patrol"" so that they can become familiar with thier beats. The premise is that the citizenry will comunicate better with a beat cop they know than just some uniform that shows up on call. Sorry it missed the mark."
1,Don't buy Lancaster!!!,"I bought a Lancaster for my husband... The clasp on the strap kept coming undone and the crystal face cracked almost immediately. All that would be one thing, but the Lancaster accredited repair affiliate has had this watch for 4 months and cannot get hold of the parts from Lancaster! I've even reached out to them myself and they just ignore me.This company will charge a lot of money for a sub-par product and then refuse to even help you get repair parts! DO NOT BUY A LANCASTER PRODUCT!"
5,Great supplemental text,"This book served as a great introduction to new material. Prior to reading the accompanying section of my real textbook, I would study this one. It always provided a strong foundation and gave context to the more in depth material. With this book, I never lost sight of the ""big picture"". Is it adequate as a stand-alone text? No. But, it isn't billed as such. It's more of a review book than anything else...and it's a fine one at that."
4,Fantastic book,"I have searched long and hard to find a great Physiology book, and I found it in Professor Constanzo's book. It is a fantastic book that I enjoyed so much,that helped me tremendously before my Step 1, and that I use even now (I am an intern) when I want to review a physiology concept. So, I highly recommend it to everyone. It is extremely well written, the concepts are extremely well taught and it has clinical correlations, too.Therefore, I only wish that Professor Constanzo had added a chapter on the physiology of blood (blood components, hemostasis), which apparently she has not done in this edition.Other than that I have only great things to say about this book!"
5,Love,"Love everything from this author. I think it is a must read for all Christians, keep up the good work."
4,A VERY SAD TALE ABOUT A GREAT PITCHER,"THIS IS THE STORY ABOUT ONE OF THE LEGENDARY PITCHERS OF THE GRAND OLD GAME. A TREMENDOUS ON THE FIELD SUCCESS AND OFF THE FIELD FAILURE. HIS 1926 WORLD SERIES IS LEGENDARY AS IS HIS STORIED CAREER. BUT HIS OFF THE FIELD DRINKING AND EPILEPSY IS VERY SHOCKING AND GUT WRENCHING. I WONDER WHAT SORT OF CAREER HE COULD HAVE HAD IF HE DIDN'T HAVE TO FIGHT THE DEMON OF ALCOHOLISM. ALEX'S PLAYING DAYS ARE DONE IN GREAT DETAIL, JUST WISH MORE WAS AVAILABLE ABOUT HIS PRIVATE LIFE. BUT A WELL DONE JOB BY THE AUTHOR. A MUST READ FOR BASEBALL HISTORY FANS."
3,Too much trival detail,"I have always wondered why there was not more written about this early hero of baseball who seemed to have such a sad and tragic life, and was very excited when I found this book. Jack Kavanagh did a wonderful job of researching the ins and outs of Ol' Pete, and reading of his life and hardships was very informative. But I believe he allowed the book to drag just a bit by trying to include too much detail about meaningless games."
4,My 4y/o enjoys playing with this,"I got this for my daughter's 4th birthday, and she loves making up designs with it. It does require half-decent fine motor skills. We have to take it out when her younger sister isn't around, since there are many pegs to lose, but overall, I am pleased with this toy."
5,Perfect fit for my Suzuki Sidekick,I thought this was going to be some sort of generic fitment kit for a Thule rack but it is perfectly molded to the roof line of my 1998 Suzuki Sidekick 4dr. It fits in the rain channel on the roof perfectly. Once the rail is snugged down it is very sturdy. Great product.
3,"Multi-purpose -not just for Halloween,but overpriced","I ordered these for my son because he needed boots for a costume. He had them on the other day,saying they're great when he has to go outside and it's sloppy wet out. Good he can use them, because they ARE overpriced for a pair of plastic."
2,Your library deserves better,"This must be about the 15th reissue of this recording, this time for RCA's 'library' series. Some people like this performance, because it is so 'full of profound feeling'. I don't. There's nothing wrong with showing empathy with the music, but Horowitz sometimes resembles a Tyrannosaurus Rex crying for help--I doubt there's a more histrionic performance available. Apart from that, the deluge of missed notes, a piano that sounds like a nail on a blackboard, a lot of crude piano banging and an uninspired support from Ormandy's NYPhO, make for a performance that is plainly dreadful. Also included: a sonata that sounds more like a Horowitz encore than Rachmaninov. Try Ashkenazy/Fistoulari, Andsnes/Berglund, Weissenberg/Pretre, Gieseking/Mengelberg (with even more wrong notes, but such excitement!) or of course one of Horowitz' earlier performances of the Rachmaninov 3rd."
5,excellent resource for training and coaching advanced player,"this is an insightful no nonsense guide to coaching advanced players, high school age and above, female and male. Although Dorrance is best known for coaching the outrageously successful womens team at University of North Carolina, his experience with mens teams allows this book to relate to both sexes. I found his approach to quantifying all aspects of practice, which the book explains in great detail, most innovative. The chapters on fitness, off-season training, competitiveness, and team chemistry are particularly helpful to the coach looking to produce an edge for his or her team. The chapter on field organization, I thought, was a most concise and insightful approach to this subject. Dorrance does a better job of putting into words the mystique and creative force of soccer than any other coach and/or author that I have read."
5,A great reference book for a great product,"Spotted Eagle has probably trained more Vegas editors than anyone, and this book brings his in-depth experience to anyone who wants to learn Vegas. Vegas is NOT a product that conforms to the ""I want to be an Avid, too..."" interface style and conventions, instead offering new paradigms for timeline-based editing, so even experienced editors may need some help getting acquainted and developing an effective workflow.This book starts off with the basics of setting up a pc for non-linear editing of DV content, but by the time you hit Chapter 4 Spotted Eagle is taking you through the many capabilities of Vegas, a stunningly effective editing environment for the pc.Another reviewer has complained of the attention paid to audio in the book; Vegas has multi-track audio capabilities rivaling ProTools, unique for an NLE in its price range, and well justifies the depth of explanation the author gives audio.If you're looking for a book on using Vegas, this is the one!"
4,A Great Intro to Fundamentals,"I ordered one of DSE's books the minute I knew it was available thru Amazon. After receiving it, I quickly scanned thru the book, before spending more time with specific points in each chapter. Douglas explains almost all subjects with a simple approach, uncharacteristic for the Vegas4 guru that he is. He explains the fundamentals of video editting in a clear and uncomplicated way that fits well with the structure of Vegas4, which is quite easy to learn because of it's user friendliness. He spends particularly important time with the concepts of compositing and 5.1 surround sound, subjects that could be made much more complicated. I'd highly recommend this book for any noobie just getting started with Vegas4 or NLE's, in general. If I have any complaint, it's that more advanced users won't find as many ""secrets"" as they hoped for. Perhaps Douglas would consider writing an advanced book, someday."
5,Which Vegas are you talking about?,"This book DOES cover everything for the beginner. One of the lines in the third chapter is:""Insert CD in CD tray and Vegas will autostart the install."" How more beginner do you want to be? By the end of the book it teaches some advanced compositing and layers. I very much appreciated the audio side of the book, but didn't find it overbearing. Remember that Vegas started as an audio tool so that's probably why it has a large chapter on audio.I was disappointed in the missing veg files, but after emailing the author, he explained that the missing 4 files (out of over several hundred) would be posted to his webpage. None of them are avi files, they are wmv files. Big difference in size.FWIW, Vegas is used by too many beginners, who don't take the time to learn the basics of video that this book has 2 chapters and lots of picutures on."
5,An excellent Workbook for a complex program,"This book has opened my eyes to many of the features of Vegas. I switched to Vegas because I needed a program that would handle multiple cameras and an added sound track. I was disappointed by some aspects of the program, but that was because I didn't understand the Vegas system. This book has taught me a great deal about how to use the program and about non linear editing in general. I really the appreciate the strong emphasis on audio because I am making videos of classical music recitals and the audio is really more important than the video. I also purchased a book on color correction and one on audio. This is the best of the lot."
4,Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife,"Excellent book that can't be read without thinking of what's going on in Iraq. The lessons are clear. Why don't we learn them? Democracy at the point of a gun isn't very effective, even if its in our national interests. This book gives a much better recipe for success than the one we're using now."
5,Theory From One Who Gets It,"To use a term that many in the military are fond of, Nagl ""gets it."" His understanding of counterinsurgency operations is both broad and deep, and his writing is smooth enough for the lay reader to comprehend without any difficulty.Nagl's departure from the US Army will be a loss for this country's armed forces. However, since he will be taking a position at the Center for a New American Security, hopefully we can look forward to fresh work from this great military mind."
5,Not just about COIN operations,"I'm not going to address the specific counter-insurgency tactics discussed in this book. There are plenty of other books that address such things. (David Galula's book ""Counterinsurgency Warfare: Theory and Practice"" is a good one)This book shines because it addresses how armies adapt to new combat situations. Armies that can adapt and encourage creativity tend to do well in unfamiliar combat zones. Armies that are hidebound and dogmatic tend to do poorly."
3,"Overrated, but still worth reading.","Read this book when I was still on active duty. It got a lot of hype when OIF turned into the ""long, hard, slog"" and military professionals from the brass on down had to get smart on counterinsurgency real quick. I didn't feel his thesis was well supported, so in that regard this effort falls short. On the other hand, I found it a great guide to further reading on counterinsurgency - great value for the professional. For the nonprofessional, this is a decent introduction."
4,Learning Organization,"The author review military doctrine in dealing with local insurgencies. He compares the British experience in Malaysia and the American experience in Viet Nam. The focus on the book is in describing a ""learning organization."" This is one that adapts and learns; that evolves to meet new challenges. While this applies in combat, it also has value in all organizations that deal with challenges.This is an excellent companion book to the new U.S. Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual"
4,Vietnam Post Mortem,"This scholarly comparison of Britain's source of success in the Malayan insurgency and America's source of failure in Vietnam is justifiably regarded as a textbook for a new military facing new worldwide challenges. Much of the book is given over to index and reference and the writing style is complex, consisting of sometimes confusing compound sentences. However, the lessons to be learned and the shocking revelations of the inability of the U.S. Army's leadership to adjust to the realities and challenges of guerrilla warfare in Vietnam make for some chilling reading. Strongly recommended to students of modern military history and tactics."
5,Jump in - the water's fine!,"As an 8-year full-time RVers, my husband and I ve never regretted our choice. Stephanie's book contains knowledge we've had to learn by hard knocks. There's good information about membership camping, choosing your rig, residency, budgeting, to name just a few topics. Stephanie maintains Rvhometown site to update information in her book. Definitely a book worth buying if you ever thought of just taking off - for a year or the rest of your life! Maybe we'll see you down the road. Jaimie"
5,Take Back Your Life,What a wonderful RV book Stephanie has written. My husband and I have considered the full-time life for a while now and Stephanie's book has so much valuable information. It has certainly given us more to think about before our journey.It is well written and a must for every Rv'er now and anyone even considering full-timing in the future.
4,Answered alot of questions,This book answered a lot of questions for me. It went into more detail about weights and quality of workmanship of RVs. I have a much better idea of what to look for and what to look out for.
2,Drier than dry,I tried to read it and couldn't. I skipped chapters and kept trying but the author talks like she is the utmost expert and I feel like she is putting the reader down. There is way too much technical information and not enough real life information.
5,Eric Sardinas - Must be heard to believe,"I met Eric at The Guitar Center in Falls Church, VA on Nov. 24, 1999. He and his band played for about a half hour then signed autographs and talked. I picked up his CD. I had to after hearing him play. He was unbelievable. That electric dobro screamed with his combo of brass slide and fingfr picking. Words cannot do justice to what this kid can do. Buy this Cd and play it loud!"
3,Texas style blues a la Johnny Winter,Eric sardinas comes close to his main influence and does a good job of mimivking Johnny Winter. Not much else can be said here.
4,Has to be seen live!,"After 5 years of watching Eric emerge as a live artist, I was happy to see the album come out. Eric has been the poster child for the National Association Of Music, where he has highligted every trade show thay have had in the past 5 years.His live energy has to be seen. As for the recording, it's much the same as sitting at a performace, and closing your eyes. he's not a ledgendary blues perfromer, but comes off as a LA Metal Star, that fell into the blues.Without the live performance, you end up with a rather over-the-top sounding recording, too much going on, and a bit weak on vocals.In my mind, without seeing Eric live, you can't appreciate the recording. Without a tour to boost this same effect on others, it won't become a long lasting Blues album.Still, after seeing thousands of artists in my life, i have to say that Sardinas is the most energetic, and charismatic blues performer I have ever seen. If they could only pavckage that on a CD, Eric would be a legend."
3,hardcore heavy blues,"the cd is excellent,but he needs to include some good old rock n rolllike he does it live.you really need to see this guy live hes incrediblebut i need to warn you this aint harp or piano blues, this is heavy slidemean blues(this aint your granpa bluesband)now what he needs is a cd anda dvd LIVE !!!"
4,Sardinas rocks,"I have all of Sardinas' CDs and Treat Me Right is by far the best. I call his style ""blues on speed"". I especially like Goin' to the River. I have seen his band in concert probably about 20 times now in the local blues bars and the CDs pale in comparison to his live act. He is a must see when he comes to your town."
5,extraordinarily insightful,Dockett and Beck have wtitten the only serious view of the subject of the big 3-0 that I have come across. It is extraordinarily insightful and a delight to read.
3,Reminded me of my college sociology textbooks.,"Which is not to say that it was boring, or wasn't informative, or didn't provide valuable perspective. Just that it wasn't as fun and lighthearted as I expected, and wanted, and needed.I hope there's a college professor out there who lectures on this topic who makes this required reading in her/his class.For the rest of us, I think other books available (for example, 29 and Counting... by Julie Tilsner) that provide the friendly kick in the pants we need to really get off our duffs and ENJOY this new decade of our lives. Read this book second."
4,A support group in less than 150 pages!,"Now I know what might be happening to me --- my mind and my body. Before reading Facing 30, I thought I was just one of those people who over analyzes everything rather than listening to gut instincts. This book made me think twice about quitting my job, buying an apartment and leaving my boyfriend all in the same month. Not that it excuses negative behavior or patterns, it simply gave me perspective on why I might be feeling and doing things the way I do."
1,Drivel,"My suggestion to other readers is do not waste your time or money on this book. I saw the two authors on several talk shows when this book was first published. They seemed likable and very much like people whom I could relate. So when the big 3-0 began to approach I ordered it from Amazon. I couldn't wait to tear into it. Unfortunately, I was very, very dissapointed. The best part of this book is the cover, and that's no lie. I ordered this book thinking I would get good information. Instead all I learned was that you can string together pages and pages of quotes from other people who were published years - even decades before you, and if you are lucky enough to get it published you can make alot of money and appear on several talk shows. With the constant quoting and paraphrasing this book reads like a college term paper. A bad college term paper"
1,The worst DVD player ever!!!!!!,I bought this DVD player from Target. We used it on two trips and it stopped working halfway through the second one. I contacted the company via email and they told me for $80.00 I could send it to them and they would fix it or send a refurbished one. I paid over $200.00 for this piece of junk and I am not paying them more. There should be a warranty for at least a year. We have only had it since July of last year. I am very unhappy with this product and company. I will not be buying any more of their products and I suggest that you don't either!
4,Best so far I bought,"It's very dificult to find something like this one on the market. Alounds you to connect play station and it really support the kids handle.After years of using it, cable connectors got loose and they disconnect very easy. I loove to get something like this again."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"This product didn't last very long for the money we spent on it two years ago ($250). Within the 90 day warranty period, one screen failed to work. I determined that the problem is with the #2 input on the DVD player - it's not the cords or the monitors, but the DVD player. For the kind of money we spent on this thing, I would expect better performance. When buying a portable DVD player, buy a service protection plan. From what I'm reading on them, most of them seem to die within a few months of purchase (generally after the not-so-generous 90 day warranty period. Go figure.)"
1,DON'T BOTHER! BUY A BETTER BRAND!,I purchased this dvd player for my kids for Christmas. It is February and we haven't used this very often. Myabe 7 times. Yesterdat the sound quit working for no reason. I did the trouble shooting and then called the manufactor. Nothing helped. The manufactor told me to ship it to them but I would have to pay the shipping and handling even though its under warranty! BUY A BETTER BRAND ITS NOT WORTH IT!I purchased this online from Walmart for $99.99 on Clearance. Wal-Mart is standing by it and allowing me to exchange for a better one!
3,Kawasaki DVD system,"We purchased this system last christmas for our family. When you're on a smooth road it works nicely. The picture and sound quality are pretty good. It does skip a lot when you hit even small bumps. Sometimes after we hit a bump the DVD will just spin for a couple minutes and freeze up. The picture on one of the screens occassionally goes blank and has blue lines across it. I called Target Customer Service in August and they said that it had to be handled by the manufacturer. The manufacturer is impossible to get in touch with by phone and online. I've been on hold three times for at least fifteen minutes then disconnected. I called Target back who also tried to contact the manufacturer with no luck. I was told ""sorry we can't do anything for you."" It's a nice product when working correctly, but I don't feel this product was worth the $235. that we spent (and that was on sale from $279.)"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"We bought this product for a long road trip. Great idea. Good enough picture. But even before we hit the return portion of our trip, the dvd stopped playing. I found a Target store, and they were very considerate and exchanged it for a new one. All was fine for the rest of the trip. It sat in a closet for a while until the next big road trip..which was JUST out of the warranty period. It didn't even start playing at all this time. Absolutely NO help available. I called the service number on the Kawasaki product, and no help available because the number on my product didn't match any number they had. Target employee couldn't find the number they were looking for either. I'm stalemated, with a piece of junk and no one interested in making good on it. Target doesn't carry this product in their stores any more. Neither player had more than four or five hours use, and very tender care. Buyer beware."
5,Great quality,Great Quality shirt. Fits just right. Plastic collar inserts to keep them straight are nice.
2,Shirts Wrinkle,"I had high hopes for this shirt when I bought it. However, it is not wrinkle free and needs ironing every time it is washed. It also fits slightly smaller than other shirts the same size."
1,"Fun novel, terrible edition","As for the story, those familiar with Marryat know what to expect, and this novel delivers; those new to his writing are in for a treat. My complaint isn't with the novel, but with the edition itself. This isn't a ""real"" book with binding, but that's okay; the price is right. The problem, though, is that the print is very, very light. I've bought four of Marryat's novels from this same publisher, and every copy is the same -- the type is so light that it's almost illegible. So do read Marryat, by all means, but I'd strongly suggest buying a different edition. I'd have returned these except that they're quite large -- 8/12 x 11 -- and so it would have cost more to return than the refund. Anyway, enjoy Marryat, but buyer beware..."
2,Wierd!,This is not what I expected at all. It is not related to the books like Dewey Labdin or Patrick O'Brian - no real naval action. Too many ethereal happenings.
1,pathetic- a total waste of money,"I saw a reference to this book online that said it would be offer some new slang words or words not found in other references. It doesn't.The first half of the book is in English only and meanders through topics of tourism, Buddhism, meeting in-laws, visas and work permits.The second half is a phrasebook for sex-tourists followed by a short chapter of instructions for filling out a profile for on-line dating.Mixed in with this are numerous English spelling errors, a confusing and inconsistent version of Thai phonetics with no reference to tones, a non-standard difficult to read Thai font, etc. etc. etc.I only submit reviews of products that are really good or really bad.This lame excuse for a book is a 'zero star' product.There are many much better phrasebooks that offer more at half the price. Lonely Planet being the most obvious one."
2,"Big, but only good for low-temp smoking","I prefer the vertical smokers like this one, for its capacity. also on the plus side: dual purpose grill/firebox, heavy duty construction.downside: rust, even though i keep out of rain; can't find extra racks; and, the biggest drawback, it's very hard to get temps over 200 for any sustained period, unless you use whole split logs.firebox is just too big for standard smoking with one large chimney starter's worth of charcoal or briquettes.as such, i mostly use this just for fish."
4,Gift for mom...,"Great book on DeSoto's... lots of pictures... Mom loved it, but wish it was not $30... Recommended for DeSoto lovers..."
4,"It's delightful, it's delovely, it's Desoto",The new book on the car Desoto is great. It shows many photos and brochures of the car. Very enjoyable for one who likes vintage cars.
3,Good for beginners,"This cymbal pack is definately great for its intended consumer: beginning drummers. Fair enough, I doubt Neil Peart is going to be going out on tour with them anytime soon, but they're definately worth the price. The crash is actually quite good: bright and clean sounding, with a pretty fast decay, it's the best cymbal in the pack. The hihats are pretty good too: maybe a bit dark sounding, but not really bad at all. My main problem is with the ride, however. It sounds overly pingy, with too much reverb. It's also a very loud cymbal - it tends to drown out the other instruments when playing with a band. It's inconsistent too - to get the crashiest sound you have to strike it on the edge, but move slightly upwards to the ride area and the sound changes drastically. But all in all, it's a worthy cymbal set, one I'd strongly recommend to beginner to intermediate drummers."
4,Excellent introduction.,"Primarily a military history derived from government records and soldiers' memoirs, this book is an excellent introduction to the history of the U.S. Army's campaigns against the Indians of the Great Plains and the Southwest. Preferable to S.L.A. Marshall's work on the Indian Wars due to better sourcing and writing."
4,LIGHT 'n HITCH,"LIGHT 'n HITCHThis book is a ""Treasure"". I listened to ""Light 'n Hitch"", as a young person every Sunday morning on Amarillo radio KGNC. My Dad's family homesteaded in Armstrong County in 1906. This book brings back memories of my youth and the stories direct from my heritage."
1,yes.. bad!,It's just as bad as the first book. The child skewering occurs in almost the same place (pagewise) as in the first book to show you that the good guys are actually quite bad. But never fear. They are actually the good guys because the bad guys enjoy and acknowledge their evil deeds. Confusing? This is the second book in a trilogy and trust me. Save your money and time. There are plenty of good Forgotten Realms novels out there. Don't go for this historical rip-off that can't clearly define who the bad and good guys are. They're all bad. So is the trilogy.
1,never turns off,"Mine will not turn off. Even in bright sunlight. From the moment I plugged it in, I only saw it in the ""off"" state one time. Then I left it in a dark room for hours, and when I came back it was just shining away. Looks like the circuit is fried. Obviously there are quality control issues with this product. From the reviews looks like about 10% don't work or fail within a few weeks. Wish I paid attention to that before I bought it. I really HATE returning stuff."
2,Better Than Nothing,"I bought this motion-activated night light to keep from triping over the cat in the middle of the night. I wish I could recommend it but the bulb doesn't put out enough light to make it really useful. It puts out a small arc of diffused light about 15 inches. The motion activated feature is a little slow to activate, so I find myself half-way across the room when it comes on. Plus, the light stays on too long for me (90+ seconds). This light is better than nothing, but keep looking for the perfect night light."
1,Motion Sensor doesn't work,"This just turns on at dusk and stays on until it's light. The motion sensor feature, which is why I bought it, doesn't work."
3,Pathetic Packing Job,"I ordered three of these because of the reviews. However, upon receipt of these night lights we were shocked by the way Amazon had packed them. All three were cramened into this small box with zero protection. No bubble wrap. The prongs were actually punching through the box. Why would anyone ever pack electrical devices so negligently, especially Amazon? After plugging them into our outlets none of them worked as advertised. Two of them stay on all of the time. Now we get to go through the hassel of packing them up and mailing them back. Thanks Amazon for your negligence!"
2,LED light motion activation,"GE 50723 LED Motion Sensing Night Light would be a better product in other LED colors Computer Blue, Christmas Angel Amber, Money Green, glow in the dark colors for low light living"
1,Save your money,Bought three of these. Only one worked. Threw them away and bought some similar motion detectors at a local store.. Save your money.
2,Its Ok..but could be better,"They work BUT you need to unplug them every morning - no off or on switchThey will stay on even when its light...""""Most"""" of the TimeIf they didn't stay on during light hours ..the off and on button wouldn't be needed"
2,30% broken,"I ordered 10 the first time and 3 were broken. Then I asked for 3 replacements and 1 came broken. But for some reason I am still keeping them because I dont think anything else on the market is better. These are fairly bright but they seem to shoot the light right into your eye. Would be nice if somehow they could be pointed in certain directions. Also, the photosensor is too sensitive. Even during the day, the night light will still trigger. I want it to come on only when its pitch black. The only time it doesnt come on is when it is super bright in a room. This is a sign of poor product development. If the room is already half illuminated why should the night light turn on if it doesnt contribute to the brightness of the room?"
2,Toss of the Dice,"I ordered two... one worked the other did not. Not a great value when that happens. I certainly would not recommend this product to anyone. The one that works performs nicely... but, its a bit of a dice toss."
4,Good product - perfect for many places in your home!,"Our hallway leading into the house is dark at night and it's just past the garage entrance. So when we come home at night, we're walking into pitch black. With this little nightlight, as soon as we open the door from the garage, the hallway is now lit! My only problem with it is the whiteness of the LED light. I'd prefer a softer yellow light but hey, LED lasts virtually forever and consumes less power.I will probably buy more of these. If you don't have one of these, you're probably wasting energy by leaving lights on."
3,Adequate choice among limited options.,"This nightlight is not perfect, but it is a decent option from a limited selection in this category. The sensing range of motion is not as wide as I would like, especially if you have a sideways (=) outlet instead of vertical (||). The time-out is 90 seconds after it stops sensing motion, and it will not switch on when there is sufficient light. It does not turn off automatically when it gets bright though. This means when I get up in the morning and walk into the bathroom and it turns on, it stays on the whole time I get ready despite having switched on the overhead lights."
1,Bad Item,"1.Comes on by itself without any motion.2.If the room has lights on in it, night light will still come on any way.3.The light once came on with motion, then stayed on for 5 seconds instead of claimed time on."
4,Caution gets very hot!,"I took off one star because these nightlights are not vented very well and I noticed that the one I have in a high traffic area of the house gets fairly hot in the back if it has been on and off a lot in a short time. You don't notice the heat unless you unplug it and feel the back of the nightlight like I did when I was switching it to another location.Despite this problem I still really like the nightlight, it gives off a lot of light and stays on long enough for you to get through the area before it turns off again."
5,These are great,I bought the Montion sensing night light for my parents. They placed them in the hall and near the bathroom. It give them light in the night when needed for those late night bathroom calls or when making their way to the kitchen for a drink of water. Great product.
5,sensing night light,excellent product - we use in baby's room and hallways - provides great light and impulse coverage as sensor
4,Second time's the charm,"My brother bought me one of these as a gift. The first one didn't light up when plugged in, but one flash once when unplugged. Had to get amazon to send me a new one. The second one works great and have been using it for a couple of weeks.I probably would have given it 5 stars, but since the first one didn't work; and from reading reviews this seems to be a common problem; I knocked it down one star."
2,"does not work in the cold, otherwise ok","I got this for my garage. It worked great for a few weeks, but it got cold out and the temp in the garage was 45ish. The light stayed on all the time. I tried a few things thinking it was picking up interference somehow, but then put it in the house to test, and it again worked great, so put back in garage and it stayed on all the time again. They should tell you it has a temp limit. If you want to use it in cold places don't get it. For me I wasted money."
4,Good sensor light,"This nightlight is pretty impressive. It will sense me in the dark from at least 20 feet away depending on how fast I'm moving (about 15 feet away is the closest I get trying to sneak up on it from a straight on angle). Sensor doesn't sense within 180 degrees though. Probably about 90. Also, if you walk close enough to it (maybe 6 inches to a foot) and lights are already on you will cast a dark enough shadow to trigger it. Otherwise, the sensor is smart enough not to turn on when not needed. Overall I'm very happy with this product and shopping on amazon has yet to disappoint my expectations."
1,Worthless,"The light turns on when it is first plugged in, sometimes, but even in low or no light the sensor does not work. It never turns on, totally garbage."
1,More junk!,"Are there any cheap electronics made in China that work anymore? It seems like 75% of the stuff I buy either is defective right out of the box or fails in less than a year. The night light turns off and on, over and over when there is no movement. It is also supposed to stay off in a ""bright room"" and that didn't work either!"
3,Doesn't work like it states it will....,I love the night light but it goes off and on whenever it feels like it. I could be 100 feet away sitting in my living room and it goes on and off with no one being around it which I think is odd and annoying. I shut my bedroom door at night bc the light is in the hallway since again...it goes off and on at any given time.I love the look and the brightness of the light but the quality control for this item really stinks...and it shows in its reviews.
2,A ok light,I bought 3 of these lights. The firsts motion sensor didn't work and light just stayed on. The other two over time the motion sensor stopped working.
2,night light,This gives off very little light and so is not very effective. I would not purchase this light again if I had a choice.
5,Great,"Works great, and a bit sensitive which can be creepy when no one is near it and it just pops on......maybe it picked up a bug or ghost(doubt it), who knows but I am very satisfied, and i do recommend it."
1,"Do not buy, it Only last 11 months","It worked great when it was working. But after 11 months, it stopped working. No light. What a piece of junk considering the price paid. Do not buy."
2,First item came in a non working condition,First item came in a non working condition. Be aware purchase from a vendor with a good return policy. The return process to Amazon.com was excellent.
2,GE 50723 LED Motion Sensing Night Light,"Bought it from Amazon, Plugged it in for the first time, and it never turned off. When I tried to unplug it to see if there was switch to enable the timer feature, the whole thing ripped apart leaving the back part with the prongs in the outlet. Will have to return it, and will look for a different light"
1,Great until it burned out in week 5 & 2nd one wouldn't shut off!,"We absolutely loved this nightlight. We used it in the bathroom for the nighttime trips as well as in the morning, while you are still adjusting to being awake. The motion sensor worked perfectly and the light was just right. And it looks very attractive. However, in the 5th week of using it, it burned out! Amazon's returns policy only accepts electronic returns within 30 days. I emailed Amazon but did not receive a response. So, buyer be warned - it's the luck of the draw. (I am, however, ordering another. Let's see what happens.)** Update: The second nightlight worked great for a week and then would not turn off! Sadly, returning this one as well. The search continues for a motion detecting night light.** Update 2: The third night light worked from Sept until Jan. A decent run, I guess. But is that OK? Not to me. I won't be buying these again and am asking Amazon for a refund."
5,Love 'them,I have 6 of these throughout my home and I love them. I tried another type and was not as satisfied as they seem to say on even when the main light source is on. These turn off appropriately. Highly recommended.
2,Works well..but intermittantly,When this night light works...it works great. It will only turn on in the dark when it is triggered by motion. The problem is that it doesn't work this well all the time. Every so often the light will stay on all the time no matter what..even in the light.
4,Effective tiny night light,"I bought several night lights. This one is very reliable. The plug is under a wall cabinet. The night light switches on every time I open the cabinet even in day light. Other than that, it is perfect."
4,Does the job!,Put this in our hallway for if we have to use bathroom at night. Does the job. Don't have to worry about batteries. Would be nice if it had a sensitivity setting though. As infared is semi unhealthy.
4,Motion light,"We got these night lights after seeing them in someones house. They had a different model, but we loved that they came on when you have to get up in the middle of the night or when the husband comes to bed after you and doesn't want to turn the light on. Only problem we have is that we put one in the hall. It comes on when no one is there and doesn't go off as quickly as the one in the bedroom. We think this is because 1) when the heat comes on and ther is moving air in the hall, and 2) the hall is about 3-4 foot wide and the nearness of the wall makes the light stay on longer. We moved the light to another spot and it's much better.Love, Love, love it!!!"
4,Works good now,"I ordered two of these along with a different kind.One of these was defective, but Amazon replaced it right away.These really work well ans are supposed the have a lifetime bulb."
1,Returned 2 of them.,First one I got didn't work and return it and then the second one didn't work either so returned it for a refund. Bought one at Lowe's just like it that works great so don't know what the problem was. The return process was very easy and quick which kept this from being a nightmare.
3,almost good,Three easily fixed issues:1) light beam is too narrow2) motion sensing angle too narrow3) light sensor not sensitive enough
3,Do I have rats?,"This is really annoying in my bedroom. It keeps waking up at random times in the middle of the night, when I promise I'm lying very still under my covers. I keep wondering if it's picking up a bunch of rats that only come out at night, but I'm sure it's not.I'm probably going to put this in a closet somewhere and get another night light for my bedroom, because I was looking for something with a more accurate motion sensor.Pros:+Very inexpensive lighting+Random lighting effect would be great to make it look like people are home when you're really not+For a bigger light, still only uses one outlet of a two-outlet plug+Gentle light, brighter than some, but not super brightCons:-Bad for a bedroom, because of randomness, but would be good for a garage or closet-Seems bulky, even though it's really not that big"
4,"where i need it, when i need it","This is a nice little nightlight. I placed one in my garage which goes pitch black when the door is down. It is sensitive enough to pick up slight motion 6-7ft away. Decorative light pattern. Gives just enough light to see where I'm going, shuts in a minute or so. I like the fact that I don't have to see light until it's needed. Bought a second for the house. Slightly on pricey side, hopefully it will drop."
4,Reliable Motion sensor,"I am curretnly using three of GE 50723 motion sensors. They are working as described. However, the same model number 50723 has different descriptions: does it use LED light or Incandescent light? It is not clear at all. The price is on the high side; it should sell for less than $10. Other than that I have no complaints so far."
1,1 out of 2 worked!,"I bought 2 GE Motion Sensing Lights. Both worked at first and then one failed completely. I'm hoping the seller will do what is right and send me another one, once they read this."
1,didn't work,bought one but motion sensor didn't work at all out of the box. just refunded it. Will try another brand instead.
1,Worked for 1 month...More crap from GE!,It worked great for 1 month. And then it just died. A little expensive for a night light that only lasts a month. And this isn't the first time I've purchased crappy merchandise from GE (made in China). GE just made my DO NOT BUY list!
1,Stopped working after 2 months,"Disappointed as I bought one of these and also one of another brand. Liked the lighting on this one better as it wasn't so bright for sleepy eyes, but it stopped working after only two months, so would not recommend to anyone. Am looking into buying a motion sensor plug to use with a small lamp instead as there are some that you can set for nighttime only. This nightlight would come on all the time, even during brighter days unless the sun was shining really close to it."
2,Totally disappointed,"I bought this after reading many reviews and got it from one of the vendor in NYC from Amazon. The first one was totally not working and I contacted the seller for an exchange. Of course, I paid extra shipment for the return. After more than a week (I live in NYC and the first one only took 3 days). It lasted for only two days and went dead. I did not want to bother myself and just threw it away. I order another product from internet; Mr. Beams motion sendor light and this product is excellent and I would recommond it to my frieds."
1,"Works great... for 3 days, then it died!","I loved that this was a Motion Operated LED light that was AC powered. And for the first three days it worked great. Then it stopped turning itself on.I took it out of the wall socket and pushed it back in, and when pressing on the sensor section, the LED turned back on and as it did, it started to make a sound that I can only describe as a 'crackle' which makes me think of electricity arcing (ie shorting out).This 'crackling' went on for two or three attempts at pulling it out and re-seating it back in the wall plug and now completely dead.I would not recommend buying this night light."
3,Goes off all night long,I was really happy with this light at first. Very bright when it detects motion. The only issue is that it goes off all night long for no reason. I was using it in my bed room and the light would wake me up over and over. I suppose this would be a good light for a hallway or some where that wouldn't bother some one sleeping.
3,Hit and Miss,The first item I purchase didn't work out of the box so I returned it and ordered another one. My second item works pretty well -- turns on when motion is detected and turns off after 90 seconds.
5,Works well,"Was hard to find a night-light that had reasonable reviews, and I didn't want a battery-powered one or a super-bright one or one that blocked my outlet. This one works great; worked upon arrival, motion detector works in virtually no light, almost but not quite too bright, etc. When it dies I'll probably buy another."
1,save your money,"Bought 2 of these - and they weren't exactly cheap. One stopped working after a day. I pulled it apart and the board trace was lifted and the LED was cold soldered on both leads. I resoldered it as best I could, plugged it in and - still dead. On the other hand, the other one still works, so it's a 50/50 chance yours will too.Note that these do not have light sensors, so they go on ALL the time when there is motion. Not terribly bright, but good enough for a night light. The diffuser on the bulb gives a harsh pattern on your floor/wall - they could have done a better job there. Also, you are going to end up plugging it in at the standard 12"" off the floor - so pets walking by will constantly trigger this light. That could be a real annoyance depending on where you use it."
1,Give your money to a local charity instead.,"They did not work so I cant even get to the point of saying they are tacky and cheap looking.Bought 3 of them. Two did not even switch on, the third stayed on the from second you plugged it in.This item is an absolute rip off."
4,Good brightness but I found that I had to get about 3 feet away from it,Good brightness but I had to get about 3 feet from it before it turned on. And if I was walking faster I was almost right on it before it came on. The light was mounted in a hallway.
1,JUNK,"This thing was a peice of crap, at first it did not work as stated, as a motion sensing light then after being plugged in for about an hour it did not work at all. I guess I should not be suprised as although it has the GE name brand it was made in CHINA!!! I can't give it lower than one star or I would."
1,piece of junk,"It didn't work at all.Light came on only once, the first time I plugged it in. Then it timed out and it never came back again, regardless of how much movement I did in front of it. Unplugged and plugged it back a few times, nothing. I ended up trashing it the same day, didn't bother to return it. Avoid it."
4,Great nightlight - bought 3 - 1 didn't work,"This is a great light. This does what it says, it lights up when it detects motion and is off otherwise. The sensor was a little tricky to understand. It doesn't immediately go off if you turn on a light in the room, i think that room lighting just blinds the sensor. So once it goes off (90 seconds after coming on) it goes off and stays off. Ordered 3, 1 didn't work, so amazon is shipping me another one and returning this one. But it really is a great little light"
1,Very expensive for not much output,"I was not pleased with the results of this night light, the light output did not meet my expectations especially for the higher price point than its competition"
4,Good lamps,"I had two lamps connected in electrical outlets. This lamp is excellent as it is sencible movement (6 meters) and the lighting is soft and quiet when it turn on ( the switch is not a mechanical system). But on cloudy days in the interior of the house is few dark, they still work. This is my criterion. I gift it to my mother and I will buy others to my sisters."
2,not a very good product,I have owned this product for 3 months now. However after two months I noticed that it was not working as before. The light would not come on or if it did come on it would not turn off after the 90 seconds time frame. It is too late for me to return the product as it is past the two months. I will not purchase this over priced night light again.
3,GE Night Light,"It's okay, I don't rate it higher because it doesn't light up as wide an area as I had hoped for. For this reason I wouldn't buy it again."
5,Great motion sensing night light,"I looked everywhere for a motion sensing night light b/c I liked my old one. I couldn't find one so then I looked on-line. This night light is better than my old brand (First Alert Model FH-26) b/c it does not turn on with motion during the day saving energy. It is also a brighter white light color and LED which saves more energy. I bought 8 lights as used them all over the house so we don't have to turn on lights just to pass through hallways, grab something in the bathroom, and check on kids at night. I would highly recommend this night light!"
4,Different item shipped.,"We received a different product from the one described. However, now that we've had the ""LED"" version of this night light for a few weeks, we are very pleased with them. Other LED night lights haven't worked as well for us because they just didn't emit enough light. These are very efficient and bright enough for going up and down the stairs safely. Actually, it's a good thing that there are no replacement bulbs to worry about. This would have been a 5 star review but we're not sure which version of the night light we would receive should we order more in the future."
3,"Good night light, but has a very weak light sensor","Other reviews already say everything what is good about this Night Light. And I agree with that. But I was actually disappointed when I found out that the light keeps getting activated at day time. Apparently only very bright light satisfies this Night Light's light sensor so it does not activate. Otherwise, it keeps getting lit when it is light enough around. The light itself is not bright, and while it is just right for the night light it is definitely not bright to replace a normal source of light. At daytime that light is very annoying and is a waste. I have to unplug it every morning to avoid those unnecessary activations during day.I would not buy it again."
1,GE Motion Sensing Night Light,"Couldn't be worse, unless it didn't glow at all. I could have purchased a night light at the Dollar Tree store which would do the same thing. It constantly glows. It does not shut off. The motion detection feature lasts for one motion. Then the light stays on forever. I would not recommend this product, and I'm surprised that others have said positive remarks about it."
2,OK when it works,Bought 4 of these. I did not work at all when it arrived. It was replaced by amazon. Another one worked fine for 5 weeks and then just died. I would not recommend this product due to the production QA. The remaining lights that are working are pretty nice but not near worth $17!
2,"Good night light, Bad motion sensor","I bought one of these lights and liked it so much I bought a second one within a couple of months. However, shortly thereafter one of the motion sensors stopped working and the light stayed on all night. About 6 weeks later the same thing happened to the other. So, until they can work out their quality control items on the sensors in these light I would not advise buying one. Other than the sensor, the light is great and when it worked I absolutely loved it."
4,good,Bought this a year ago.. Wasn't what I expected but was good while it lasted..About a month ago it stopped working don't know why.
4,white but a little weak,"OK for the bathroom, but not for a large living room. Not quite as sensitive nor as bright as ""Cooper Lighting HS8 90 Degree Motion Activated Night Light Cooper Lighting HS8 90 Degree Motion Activated Night Light "" which we also bought and my wife prefers because it's brighter and more sensitive. But I prefer this GS 50723 because its LED will never need replacement, it's really white (not incandescent yellowish), it's smaller (doesn't cover the other outlet at all), and its light is ""angled"" up (so you can mount it upside down to ""angle"" down so it doesn't shite in your eyes.)"
1,I received a lemon,"Given all of the glowing reviews I am certain that there are good ones out there, but the one I received never worked properly from day one. Day or night, motion or not, it was always on. Fortunately the return process was easy. I chose to return it for credit and purchased another similar model, which was cheaper and which also works as advertised."
3,Love the 1 out of 2 I Bought,"Bought two. One works exactly as described. The other one is photo-sensitive, so it turns on when dark, but will not turn off after all motion has ceased and time has passed. Will look into getting that replaced."
2,A Classic Ruided,"This Echo Library edtion is a great disappointment. It is riddled with mistakes; words run together, first letter of many words missing, placement of footnote numbers incorrect. There are many different formats used for tables. Their decision to remove the original illustrations and diagrams was a major mistake. It is obivious that a proper proof reading was not cared out. The responsible person for this production has a lot to answer for.In my opinion this edition should never have come to print. It is no longer a useful reference to the serious student nor is it much good for the casual interested reader."
2,Opt for the e-books version (Gutenberg Project),"I had the e-book from the Gutenberg Project, was looking for the illustrations that were missing in that version. This is nothing more than a re-print of the e-book, though it has a fancier cover.A disappointment to say the least - I wish I had seen the reviews before I purchased."
3,Colors and Shapes Circus,Our 2 yr old daughter likes the video at the begining but gets bored with it as it continues with the Shapes and Color lesson. Our 5 yr old is not interested at all. It may be for children in the 3-4 age range. The clowns are great but the cartoon lessons do not hold attention.
2,Certainly not the best of the breed.,"This text pales in comparison to another I have read devoted to UI design. Everything here seemed like a repeat of what I have read before. Worse yet, it was delivered with less interesting, and less easily digested, prose. I found the content generally shallow and the examples lacking.I suggest that you consider ""About Face"" by Alan Cooper instead. There is a book that rates a 10."
5,Insights and pointers to knowledge you didn't know you had!,"Fabulous book! For the intermediate designer who needs a condensed, no nonsense - quick view! (aka..The ideal users manual)"
3,Other UI Design Books are better,"While this book does offer a number of good and practical UI design tips, it simply isn't as compelling as other books on the subject. I would recommend Alan Cooper's ""About Face"" over this book. On the bright side, this book's ""Key Idea!"" sections do make it easy to scan through for the concepts you're interested in, thus avoiding the often difficult to read main text."
2,for the novice really,"the book isn't a bad book but it's more of a reference and a little on the novice side. If you haven't already, check out ""The Human Interface"" by Jef Raskin. That is a far superior book."
4,Alphabet with Elmo,"This is an Elmo book, so chances are good any parent of a toddler will end up owning it sooner or later. So this review is simply to reassure you that's not a bad thing.The letters start off with the typical ""A"" for ""apple"" but also includes higher concepts like ""joke"" and ""poem"", with examples showing what joke and poem mean. The letters are colored and bolded in the text but not a huge focal point like some alphabet books. Look for another book or flash cards if you want that.At an average of 20 words-per-page, I suggest holding off until your toddler's patience allows you to remain on a page for at least ten seconds.My only complaint is for the last couple pages. W, X, and Y get examples in the pictures but nothing in the text. And then ""Z"" (spoilers!) is paired with Zoe but she only gets a tiny picture on the back cover that doesn't even look like she appears on Sesame Street these days!"
3,Just cute....not great,"This book is definitely cute and there's nothing majorly wrong with it. I purchased this for my 14 month old son. The problem, I guess that's what I'll call it, is that some of this things depicted as examples of words that start with such and such letter, are too abstract for kids under probably 3....maybe older . For instance, the letter ""I"" uses Imagination as the example word. I just don't know why they wouldn't have used a more easily illustrated and understood word such as ""ice cream"" even ""igloo"". They also use ""love"" for ""L"" which is nice, but again it's a bit abstract for a really small child. Other than that, the pictures are brightly colored and of course, there's Elmo. Not my favorite ABC book, but hardly awful. Would be appropriate for a child over 2 1/2 in my opinion."
4,ok,"This book is just ok. My daughter likes it, but I find it annoying to read as it is very long. I would recommend other Elmo books way before this one. There are better ways to learn the ABCs."
3,so so,"My daughter does not like this book.It is kind of expensive considering it is a paper book, not a hard-page book as I expected."
3,"Good book, but could be better","The big size of the book was a hit with my toddler. But the graphics of Elmo and others in their huge size tend to draw away attention from the letters themselves, which are comparatively much smaller in size. Also, the big size of the book makes it easy to crease and bend the cover. It would have been better off as a hardback."
1,UNUSUALLY DISAPPOINTING,"We have a lot of Elmo things around the house, including books. We also have several alphabet books since my 20-month-old has learned his letters, numbers and colors with many well-organized and beautifully illustrated books we've bought on Amazon. Because of this, I thought this book would be ideal. I was really disappointed when it came. For this level of book, it had too much text and each letter was just part of the text but not featured in the illustration! I had to take a marker and go through the book and add the letter as a feature of the illustration, myself. It still didn't help. My toddler grandson, who loves Elmo, is not fond of this book at all, although he loves his other ABC books (see Charley Harper's ABC's in particular.)"
3,Sesame Street Alphabet Fun,"This book is a little disappointing, but may be appealing to Sesame Street fans. The quality of the paperback is thin and, considering the age group at which it is aimed, I had hoped for it to be a little thicker. I did give it to my granddaughter who is 15 months old and she seemed somewhat interested in the familiar characters. All in all, not a particularly inpressive product."
3,abc book,"It looked like a good book to me, especially since sesame street has one of my fave books ever-monster@the end of this book. It has not captured my son's interest even though he loves books (age 3)"
1,Never received it,This item never downloaded to my kindle app ( iPad). I tried several times but nothing happened. I notified the seller and was refunded.
1,letters to small,"The letter for each page is not any bigger than the rest of the letters/words, how is a toddler supposed to be able to pick it out?? Was very dissapointed"
3,Elmo's Review,The book has beautiful and vibrant illustrations. Although the actual print is entirely to small. Iwould recommend the book but only if you have good eyesight.
1,Better to get the real book version,"This E book is small- the pages and illustrations just don't stand out. It's a cute book but better to get the board version, I think."
3,Elmo's ABC Book,My son loves ABC's and I am using this book to teach him colors. It's cute and small and of course has Elmo.
3,Quality depends on where you're using it.,"I live in North New Jersey and I've found that the best frequency to use is the stock 88.5 FM. The sound quality sounds like a cassette tape, but after awhile you get used it. I just went on a road trip up north (into Canada) and the sound quality was much better in the rural areas. In areas where the broadcast range is not so busy, the Transdock works great and the charging feature is a huge plus. It's unusable on the NJ Turnpike for example where there are so many radio stations coming out of New York City.If you're near a city, I think the DLO Transdock is a good stop gap solution until you can go all out and get a car radio with a direct connection for your Zen. I've seen the DLO go for $85 in a store which I think is way too much, Amazons price is much more reasonable."
1,VERY WEAK SIGNAL,THE SIGNAL WAS TOO WEAK TO BE HEARD BY THE RADIO ON ANY FREQUENCY.GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD.
2,which model,Product should make more clear which model you need. I have an IPOD but received a transdoc for a Zune.
5,"Keith Rules ""In the Ranch""!","Wow! Those who listen to Keith Urban, know how talented he is...but if you're new to the scene, don't cheat yourself out of seeing just how talented he was even before he hit the solo scene! I already had 2 copies of ""The Ranch"", and bought this CD and am soooooooo glad I did! The 2 bonus tracks are great!(I just love it when performers go back and sing a little ""old school"" on their CDs)! Plus, you get 2 video bonuses! What a deal! Be sure you treat yourself to this excellent CD!"
5,K.U. and The Ranch,"Love, Love, Love this CD! Tried to order it before and it was always out of stock...now I know why. If you even LIKE Keith, you will really like and appreciate this CD. It's fun and funky and great for road trips! Hurry and get it, while it's still in stock.........."
5,Another great Keith Urban CD,"This CD is a must have for any Keith Urban fan, his music and talent is extrodinary, and can easily be enjoyed by all. Besides the 14 great songs, you get two videos, which are a great bonus. This is a must have for any music collection!!"
2,It's o.k.,"I was so disappointed in this album. It just didn't jump up and grab me like his other albums. The songs are o.k., and there just isn't a song that I can even say I really like and want to hear over and over like his previous albums. Borrow a friends first to check it out before you see if you want to buy it."
2,Not that helpful,"This book really isn't that helpful. While it does give some good tips on new ways to string your line, it only talks about maybe 20 or so kinds of fish, and spends most of its time talking about fish on the east cost. It devotes a very sparce space to the west coast and only talks about maybe 5 or so fish from the west coast. Overall, very disappointing."
3,Entry Level Info Only,"If you have no prior knowledge of what windsurfing is, and would like to learn a bit more about it (but not too much), then this book is for you. It provides some good beginner's info, discusses terminology and basic sailing concepts, and then very briefly discusses what advanced windsurfers can do. Windsurfing locations are discussed as well. Very elementary and, in my opinion, left a lot of questions unanswered. I would love to see a book that's both comprehensive and recent in publication, as they're simply not around."
1,Too short on technique,"I bought this book on the basis of the other reviews only to find that the book is way short on technique. What I wanted was a book showing basic technique - getting up on the board, steering, gybing, etc. The book contains too much verbage in areas like getting fit, some places where you can sail etc. No good to me as a beginner. I wanted more on ""how-to"" sail the board. Don't waste your money on this one. The book ""Windsurfing"" by Bornhoft is far far better."
5,Finally organized!!,My 15 year old son's ties hung haphazardly on a hanger in his closet. This tie rack was just the right trick to organize the ties and keep them from becoming wrinkled. The small footprint and easy installation were just right for his small closet. The ties stay on the pegs and can be easily selected and removed.
2,Doesn't make anyone laugh,"My girls (ages 4, 7 and 9) cracked this open, excited to have a new game to play. In the doldrums of summer, they've played Clue, Hullaballo, Sorry, Mancala, checkers and the like. I thought with all the gold stickers on the box for awards and such that this game would be the game to end all games. Um, no. There doesn't really seems to be a point to having the board and tokens other than an attempt to differentiate itself from plain old charades. The whole game was just kind of weird and a bit painful to play (or maybe we're just cranky?). Some of the cards had cute ideas to act out and I did like the fact that my 4 year old could play (with sisters who can read the cards for her), but our reaction just goes to show you can't force laughs. Save your money! This game is going in the ""give away"" pile ASAP!"
2,Big Disappointment,"I was excited to buy this for my daughter. However, we ended up only playing it once or twice. There is no point to the game...no strategy. Whether you guess right or wrong you still get to move.We ended up making up our own rules"
5,A Creative game for my wife and I to play WITH the kids,"We finally found a game that we can play WITH our kids that was fun for everyone. We still laugh at each other's interpretations of the ""Ha Ha, Ho Ho Hee Hee"" laughter cards. This is a great game that let us bond together as a family. Our kids are 5, 7, and 9 and we were all able to play and laugh together. It sure beats forcing your kids into bancruptcy."
5,You're gonna laugh!,"Super, super fun game! We play it with our son and the neighbors' kids (ages 5,7 and 9). We always have a hysterically fun time. We're laughing before we even get the game out of the box!"
4,A good berserker novel,"Overall, a good read, though it plays more like three good novellas stitched together with a decent framing story rather than a novel cut from whole cloth. As such it's fine, part tale of the berserker wars and part alternative history and part time travel. The essential idea is that Saberhagen gives planet Sirgol a history parallel to Earth's--but not quite identical. This lets Saberhagen offer interesting variations on the history of King Arthur, Galileo, and St. Francis of Assisi. My only minor complaint is a sexist gaff near the end (the hero wants the heroine to have his baby) that somewhat dates the book. Nonetheless worthwhile if you're a fan of Saberhagen and especially a fan of the berserker series."
4,Games Berserkers(and People) Play,"The Berserkers are back! In the second volume of this series the humans must battle with the berserkers for mastery of a key star system-in the past. Oh yeah, we have aliens trying to mess with the timeline, and humans who are just as ready to stop them. Dramatic, thought-provoking action brings this story to life. Great read!"
2,Assassin lacks killer punch,"Just as one expects from Fred Saberhagen, Brother Assassin is a quick, unstressful read. Assassin makes up for a glaring defect in its predecessor by focusing on one planet and having one character tie each story together; on the other hand, the Berserkers themselves leave little impression with the reader, the sense of menace from the first book is absent. While there is little negative to be said about the book (except, as another reviewer has noted, a blatent and disappointing chauvinistic remark near the end), there is little positive, either. It is competently written and holds the attention, but it is not likely to bring one hurrying back for a second read."
2,Are These Seconds?,"I've placed 2 separate orders for these bowls. Three out of the four received were dented, even though there was no damage to the packaging. I kept them since they were still suitable for my intended use, but they really should be listed as seconds."
5,Really good,"All of Scott August's recordings are great. Sacred Dreams is good. Although, I would suggest getting Distant Spirits if you are new to this artist."
4,not perfect but then no tv really is,"While color, geometry, contrast, and user flexibility excel on this set there are but 2 areas that it does not. Rainbows are still there to people who see them. Generally, people who wear eyeglasses. Wearing bifocals is worse. I fall into the latter catagory but they don't bug me. Secondly, this set falls short of producing inky blacks in scenes which have a lot of dark in them. The blacks don't ""crush"" per se but have a haze over them. In high contrast scenes the blacks look perfect. Would I buy it again? In a heartbeat. And I watch a lot of dark sci-fi. I don't think that DLP technology can be beat for the best skin tones, reproducing movement [remember, the speed here is in microseconds,not milliseconds like Lcd], ease of moving the tv, and the LED engine is icing on the cake. Bright, quiet, fast turn-on times, and cheap on power. No tv is perfect, but I love mine."
5,everybody say wow!!,"Samsung HLT6187S 61"" Slim LED Engine 1080p DLP HDTVeveryone from the pizza delivery person to the mailman and now my new best friend my neighbor who never said one word to me in 6 months .walks in house see's the samsung dlp picture and there knees go weak!they are drawn like a moth to a bright light.they lose there hearing and have only tunnel vision as they murmer wow is that one of them new tv's?as a little drool comes out the side of there mouth.but really i did so much research on this and other 1080p tv's it could have been my theasis.the picture a 10...the sound a 10 value for the dollar a 15! thank you samsung for making it possible to get a quality product and not have spend 5k.you will end up spending 5k when you see this tv in your home .because now the sound system isn't good enough and the dvd has to be replaced with a blu-ray player.but thats ok because now i can honestly say i own a home theatre thanks to samsung!"
5,LED DLP rocks.,"We have had this two years now and it is still awesome. I went with LED to avoid having to replace those $200 bulbs other DLP's use. The price of Plasma,LCD and ""Flat screen"" TV's is outrageous, so the price of this 61 INCH!!! for a 8 inch deep TV was fine by me!"
1,These don't even taste like licorice these were awful,"I KNOW EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT TASTES BUT THIS DIDN'T EVEN TASTE LIKE LICORICE !!!I love licorice and I am always up to trying something new but this was an expensive mistake. I read the reviews and thought these would taste pretty good. But if you like red vines,twizzlers and Aussie brand than chances are you will not like these. Don't waste your money!!!!I have even tried to give these away and as soon as people try one they are not interested.I don't like leaving negative reviews but if I can save someone time and money this would be the perfect item to do so with."
5,Great Art!,Running across a Howard Hodgkin exhibition forever revolutionized my formerly negative view of modern art. It has opened my soul to new areas of art enjoyment not experienced previously. This book has many plates of his work and provides very interesting reading. Let his beautiful art and colors wash over you... Enjoy!
1,Not!,"Extremely simplistic lyrical formula and typical tracks make this a very basic CD. I wish amazon would stop recommending me these type of CD, it is a waste of my money! I will definately be returning/reselling this. This has only three reviews mine's make four that should have been a sign for me.Don't waste your time."
2,cheap but uncomfortable,"The gloves are warm, but are kind of uncomfortable. I bought them so I can keep my hands warm while driving. They do they job well.If you look for better quality and can afford it, then buy the Eddie Bauer leather gloves. They are far superior."
3,Gloves,"I gave these gloves as a gift. He wasn't able to wear them, because they ran to small. He gave them to his wife and she thought they were really warm."
4,Wow,Be prepared for a candid but fun reading! Molly is raw in her poems about sex that will make you blush.
1,Not satisfied with quality of Dingo Treats,"These treats are normally chewy, but the product I received was hard as a rock. I called the manufacturer (Dingo) to decipher the expiration code. They said the product I received was just about to cross over the expiration date. My dog still eats them, but not before he gives it a little snub."
5,carpenter,"Great place to Buy from had the blade the next day was very happy with how fast it did get shipped,,Great way to keep happy at a Great price......100% happy"
5,Good value,"Really good value, great variety and excellent quality. My daughter used them for a school project that went perfectly. Good for origami and any paper decor project."
4,Not TRUE washi paper,"This isn't real washi papaer, but it's still very nice for the price. I like it and it's good origami papaer all the same. REAL washi papaer is much nicer."
4,Of Comfort,Exactly as the title states.C.H. Spurgeon (The Prince of Preachers) can also be called the Prince of Spiritual authors as far as I am concerned.His writings are always substantial and meaningful to me.Recommended highly.
3,Celia's House: Large Print Edition,Celia's House: I feel that in in describing the book it should be mentioned that it is a large print book. Otherwise the book was as described.
3,Need a book on life in CND from an immagrants perspective?,"I have to read a book about how like to live in Canada from someone who is originally from a different country. This book fit that criteria. I was good. Full of imagery. It was depressing at times, because you can see how racially cruel kids can be. At one point the book mood switches to romance. I didn't like this because it throw me off, and i didn't care for how Marlyn wrote it. Other then that the it was interesting."
3,"Wanting to pass? read, looking for a good time? dont.","i am a grade 12 student and wsa given this book to read as a novel study assignment. The book, i'd say, is like every other novel ive read at school since grade 10. They all touch on the subject of a teenager and his/her life stories, all the hardships followed by all the...happiness? and never once sticking to one situation but following so many that you begin to forget that your only reading one novel. This book is yet another early 1900's book written by some rebel author who decided to write about something that was so taboo and out of line back in the day. All i have to say about this is that this book was boring and dull but for some reason quite interesting. ...?"
2,Annoying and depressing.,"I had to read this book for school and I HATED IT. Redemption is ""apparently"" won at the end of the novel; but I am too shallow and materialistic to see it as that. Why does life have to be so miserable? The main character's life truly, passionately sucked. Greed, stupidity and naivete basically sum up his hateful attitude and it helped him ruin an otherwise semi-mediocre and poverty-stricken life"
2,Not Punk At All,"This was such a waste of time and money. A bunch of directionless young fools, trying to act intellectual. There's no identity, just a thorough lack of creativity and originality. I grew up listening to hardcore and punk music, and those shows had so much raw intensity and energy. These kids plain and simple sucked! Walking on the American Flag to get into their freshly painted bus? Really? I'd go to a show of theirs simply to strangle them. Punks? No. Idiots? Definitely!"
3,"Satisfying, depending on your taste","The Showmen of Today video is satisfying if you really enjoy watching the big name superstars in basketball today. They did great features on Kobe, Shaq, and Allen. And my absolute favorite was Vince Carter! The video kind of took the game of an old-school player and compared it to a new-school player with some similarities. My only question is: Where was Kevin Garnett and Tracy McGrady? They could have used the segments on Tim Hardaway and Grant Hill to cover them."
1,Toy is NOT compatible with the wooden Thomas Train Set,"This toy is NOT compatible with the regular wooden Thomas Train Set. Toys R Us should have this information listed in the description above. Also, if you order this through Amazon.com, be careful in returning this item. You cannot physically return Thomas Train toys to a Toys R Us store, even though you may have logged into toysrus.com. Apparently, the toys are under Imaginarium.com, and toys purchased through Imaginarium.com can only be returned through shipping them back. Finally, the shipping charges are more expensive when returning a toy, than when you initially purchase it online."
3,The Brave with Johnny Depp,"The movie cut several scenes. I bought this movie before and had to go thru my p/c Toshiba to change regions. You can only changer regions twice,so when I saw this on movie on Amazon saying it was for several regions, I ordered it. Like I said it cut out several scenes. It's a great movie with Johnny Depp acting and directing.The only movie Depp has directed.So I was disappointed the scenes were taken out. If you've never seen the movie,guess it would be ok. I was delivered promptly."
4,The Brave DVD,Have been searching for this item for so long. I did enjoy it and as always Johnny was gorgeous and did a great job on this film as director. The product arrived in good condition and without delay. Thank you Amazon.
1,I recently gave this seller a good rating but then,"I bought a dvd for my wife for christmas from this seller, it arrived almost instantly and it looked to be flawless ""looked"". When my wife opened it and tried to watch it, it did not play at all, when i tried to contact the seller again, he ignored me and never even tried to contact me again. Needless to say i was premature on my original comment, and sellers like this are the reason why people should beware when ordering things online from strangers"
5,Quick as a Bunny,I order a used stamp book and the company informed me that it would arrive in two weeks. I was surprise that it arrive in two days.
4,"Good, gritty vintage murder mystery with twists","I thought from the title that Raoul Whitfield's DEATH IN A BOWL (1930) was set in a football coliseum. Instead, it turns out a murder is committed in the Hollywood Bowl during an outdoor concert. Interesting plot and good characters in this novel made it a fun read for me."
5,The best ever.,I would reccomend to anyone that likes good gravy in the morning that has that traditional flavor and consistancy every time.
5,REAL WESTERN SWING,"GREAT WESTERN SWING INSTRUMENTALS, GOOD SELECTION OF TUNES, EXCELLENT MUSICIANS AND EVEN SOME MERLE TRAVIS PICKING, A MUST HAVE CD FOR ANY SERIOUS WESTERN SWING FAN."
4,Great book,"This is a great book, but it is more for the beginner to intermediate trader. What separates this options trading book from others is that its focus is more practical rather than on theoretical profit and loss diagrams of different options strategies and combinations. He describes each trade from initiation to the end and gives different scenarios on how each trade was managed. After all, options trading is not about the theoretical profit and loss diagrams or fancy combinations, but about the management of the trade itself."
3,Greatest hits plus a mixed bag of American standards,"Purchase this 2-CD set for the first disc, which features sterling remasters of most if not all of her greatest hits. The second disc holds far less appeal. Murrary warbles pre-WWII ditties like ""What'll I Do"" and ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"". Problem is, she doesn't have the voice, the reach or the emotional resonance to perform most of them. With maybe two exceptions, they are performed in the most perfunctory manner; they sound like throwaways, whether she intended them to or not. If you thought this was going to be a sequel to CROONIN', her wonderful collection of post-WWII standards, you will be sadly let down. If you want to hear those songs modernized and done right, listen to Harry Nilsson's interpretations, available on both the original album A LITTLE TOUCH OF SCHMILSSON and the 2-CD Australian set, THE BEST OF HARRY NILSSON (and this includes SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW, which was cut from the original album)."
5,"REAL DANCE TUNES FOR ""COUPLES""...","This 2CD set just arrived - have played the first CD four times, just love it!!! Real dance numbers for couples who remember what it's like to dance ""together"" - back in the days when a guy held a gal and got around the dance floor. Anne Murray is a great singer and I go way back with her albums. On this her new CD ""All of Me"" she does wonderful arrangements of all those standards and classics. Just put in on, grab your partner, dance up a storm, or just sit and listen, or join in with Anne, harmonize away, takes you back!!! I recommend this CD to folks that are older than baby boomers - mostly because of the first CD - but the younger folks, they too could learn to love these tunes, so many new artits today have ""seen the light"" and are doing old the old standby songs, with great success!"
5,Almost Perfect !,"This is a must have CD for Anne Murray's fans and surprisingly the recording quality is also good. That's why is almost perfect for audiophile lover, it will pair nicely with your high-end!Wonder if there will be SACD version for high-end player...."
5,Great Music,"This lady has always been a favorite, and this is one of her very best. Heard one of the songs on the radio and knew I needed the album. Very good."
4,Complete your collection,Let me start by saying that you probably only want to buy this DVD ifA. You are a huge Bebop fanB. You have a kickass sound systemC. You want something to keep you occupied till the movie comes outD. Combinations or all of the aboveThis DVD is awesome and Bebop rocks but I dont think that it has enough to earn 5 stars. The DTS is really cool but if only it had more special features! Maybe director interviews or cast interviews or something more. Or even a trailer for the American version of the movie!
1,Cowboy Bebop - Best Sessions,"Even though I'm a huge fan or the series, I would only recommened this dvd to most die hard bebop fans. It seems almost not worth buying but just to have it becasue the words ""cowboy bebop"" are written on it. Although the sound is amazing, it doesn't make up for the price. There are no extras at all, it seems like it was made just to milk the series as long as possible. I would save your money until the movie comes out, that would be worth buying."
4,Godd but I expected more,There are four episodes Like most the second the last let me thinking always expecting to find answers in this excellent anime -
2,OK. I'll admit it.,"I haven't seen this DVD itself, but have all eight of the ""Session"" Discs. I honestly don't see how something like this can be a good thing. Cowboy Bebop is a single, coherent story. Each episode, no matter how random it may seem, contains a reference, scene, or something so small as a gesture that builds the series as a whole. Each episode relies heavily upon the viewer having seen the previous ones. When the series is broken down into ""Best Of"" segments, it loses that quality, in effect becoming snippets of a greater whole. Yes, these snippets may be good, but they cannot possibly convey the flow of the story in the manner of the full series. I would suggest saving your money and purchasing ""Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Sessions."""
2,And the point of this would be?,"This selection is at my local video store, for people who want to sample some of the most popular Cowboy Bebop episodes. But when it comes to buying this, I can't imagine why someone would go to purchase only a fraction of the series when the entire thing is available (more than twice as many episodes) for around ten more dollars. (see: The Perfect Sessions Complete Series, but be careful buying a used copy because sellers have sent incomplete versions).The product itself is fine and the episodes are great, but it jumps around the series based on ratings and fails to show more than the highlights. It might very well be the best of the season, but it's only so good without the rest of the story."
3,May not be what you think.,"Cowboy Bebop's best sessions is not really different from the six discs that make up the regular series. The stories are not changed at all. The dialogue, animation, and music are identically to the previously released discs. There are no extras worth speaking of, and no alternate endings or deleted scenes. The best sessions is just a supped up regular sessions in Dolby 5.1. There's also a (Japanese only) DDTS track. So, if you are considering purchasing this DVD for ""new"" material then don't bother. However, if you are a die hard fan, than what else can you do but click a few buttons and wait patiently for it to arrive at your doorstep."
2,Seems pointless...,"I'll also start off by saying that I don't actually have this DVD, but I do have the Perfect Sessions, which contains all 26 episodes of the series, so I have seen all the episodes on this DVD. Yes, if you really can't afford to buy the whole show, the Best Sessions is an affordable alternative, but, in most cases, anyone who watches the Best Sessions will instantly want to see the rest of the series. So, I ask, what is the point of the Best Sessions? For all you people who want to know whether or not Cowboy Bebop is for you, I'll say this: yes, Cowboy Bebop is for everybody. You'll like it. Believe me. If you still want to see a few episodes before you make an investment, watch a few episodes of the show on Cartoon Network. (Yes, it's dub, but Cowboy Bebop is known for having one of the best anime dubs made to date.)"
2,"NOT-repeat-NOT the ""Best Sessions""","I rented this some time ago with the belief that it contained the ""Best Sessions"" of the series, which it's title implies. Upon watching it I found out that it actually only contains one, or maybe two, of the best episodes from the Cowboy Bebop series. One being the first episode: Asteroid Blues. The rest were on the lower or middle end of the spectrum. This doesn't even have Pierrot le Fou on it. Which is THE. BEST. episode in the Cowboy Bebop series. My advice to you: Don't even rent this. watch Cowboy Bebop on cartoon network. It's practically free (cable bill) and actually worth your time."
3,Would spend a little more for a better guitar,I purchased this guitar for my daughter as a beginner. The guitar was defective and although they said they would replace it with a new one I went ahead and ordered a better one that is a low end guitar from a name brand guitar maker. It wasn't worth the money for me.
2,This is not a journal of Jim Woodring's dreams.,"I am disappointed in the description of this item. This is a blank book, for notes about your own dreams. If that is what you are after, this is a great book! If you're looking for Jim Woodring illustrations, you will be let down. The pages are illustrated, with faint printing that is easy to write over. The handfull of illustrations are reused multiple times."
3,"Nice, but not ""an experience.""","I already have The Method's Baby and Mom Prenatal Yoga, and it is this that I am comparing Crunch Yoga Mama to. Crunch, while more light-spirited and up-beat than Prenatal Yoga, gives less mood, less instruction. I was not always sure what the leader was instructing me to do with my hips, and this made me worry about my back. In Prenatal Yoga, there is beutiful, soothing music coming from a live band and a very calm instructor, who I first thought was hokey, and later came to appreciate. Crunch is a little piecemeal compared to this, with less flow and rythm. It's more of a class than an experience. Still, it was a little easier, nice for a change, and added more poses to my repertoire."
3,Good Basic Prenatal Yoga video,"If you are looking for a solid prenatal yoga video, then this is it. It goes through various prenatal yoga stretches, poses etc. at a steady pace. But don't expect this to be a workout, especially if you were physically fit entering your pregnancy. It also lacks the meditational/spiritual quality that some of us expect to be included in a yoga class."
2,Not impressed,"I was really excited about trying a prenatal yoga video. I have never tried yoga and I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to prepare my body to give birth for the third time. However, I was not impressed with this video. It was basically just a few stretches which I thought was the warm-up, but then the video was over. If you are looking to do some stretches then this video is for you. If you are looking to prepare your body to give birth, look elsewhere."
1,Don't Buy,"I don't suggest you buy this set, very poor materials, very weak construction, you would be better off going out and spending a little more money for the individual well made tools and get a little tool chest for them."
3,Can not say this did anything for me.,I did not feel that I had less appetite nor did I feel that I had more energy. No harm done though.
3,You get what you pay for,"This red dot is ok. I ended up sending it back and spending a little bit more for a Leatherwood red dot. The reason being is that although the tasco works, it wouldn't hold zero on my AK. For lower power rifles this red dot may be fine. It wasn't on my AK."
5,Tasco Red Dot Scope,I am very pleased with this scope. I have it mounted on a Horton Hunter Supreme XL Crossbow. It was very easy to sight in & the Brightness adjustment is also very good. VERY accurate sight.
5,Good product,I got it for my son. I can't say first hand how it works or anything really. He seems to like it.
2,You get what you pay for,"The parallax correction on this sight is pretty awful. If you don't center the dot perfectly, the POA changes quite drastically. This sort of defeats the purpose of a red dot sight."
2,Defective,"Not to say others might be better, but my sight was defective from the box it seemed. I was unable to sight the dot due the elevation not changing when turned. It was on the other hand very simple to install and felt solid overall. For the portion that did work, I will give it 2 stars."
2,Failed,"Nice Red Dot however when I searched for a Red Dot for my AR-15 this one came up. It failed to state the Red dot sits below the forward fixed sight and can not be used without a riser. Another $10.00, wasted time and ammo."
3,scoop,It is a good scoop but we needed a slimmer scoop but it worked well on our larger pistol thanks
4,Great New Brain Game,"I love this game. I like Mind Quiz much better than Brain Age and Brain academy. I like the graphics on Mind Quiz. I find myself playing certain games just to help with stress.One thing that is troublesome is on the 2 games that you need to write in the answer, it has trouble reading the numbers. The voice game also has problems recognizing words. Other than that GREAT GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Mind Quiz,This is a great tool to help improve your brian . Plus it is fun to play with others showing them ways to improve themselves.
5,great gift for young and old,I bought this for my granddaughter for her birthday. I have had it for a long time. She just turned nine and thinks this is awesome. I think it's great she can play a game and develope her brain at the same time.
2,Not worth the money...,This game is nowhere near the quality of Brain Age and Big Brain Academy. The number of mini games is pretty limited. And they're not fun to play.
5,An Insightful Look at Person-Affecting Consequentialism,"Author addresses issues of creating future people and conduct toward future people within a perspective sympathetic to the utilitarian foundations of current social policy theory. Presents an alternative to the total utility view that genuinely takes into account individual well-being, by incorporating the ""person-affecting"" insight. Read this book if you are interested in normative ethical theory and/or issues surrounding new reproductive technologies."
1,Weak analysis,This is not a useful or interesting treatment of the issues it raises. The analysis is weak and focused more on terminological problems than on substantive insights. Cannot recommend it for anyone with an interest in the subject matter.
4,Captivating Stories,"Although it is suggested for children ages 4-8, I often use this book for projects about countries around the world. The stories are descriptive with wonderful illustrations. Whoopi Goldberg is not the illustrator, but wrote the introduction for the book. The illustrations were done by many different people."
4,"south, north, east and west",Excellent book. Stories from other countries. Given to my child's teacher so that the stories can be shared with other children. A group of actors have turned some of these stories into plays. It was amazing.
4,Good Purchase,"I wasn't sure about the red ""thermo spot"" in the center of the pan. It is supposed to change when it gets hot enough. Mine does not and it seems that it is a little warped because when I put oil in the pan, it all rushes to the sides. Maybe that is why the ""thermo spot"" doesn't work, it isn't touching the stove. Otherwise, good purchase. It was recommended by America's Test Kitchen, that's why I bought it."
5,Time will tell,"While I stand amazed that this pan was not damaged in shipping, I am also quite pleased with its performance so far. It does take more time to heat up than others, but the results have been consistently outstanding regardless of the food being cooked. I have used it for bacon, chops, mushrooms and onions, sandwiches, and various egg dishes (always with cheese) to include frittatas finished under the broiler. Initial seasoning was easy, rubbing in an olive/canola oil mix after cleaning. After that, ""slick"" is an understatement. Only time will tell how long the non-stick finish will last."
5,Best pan for scrambled eggs I've ever used,"I've been looking for a pan to fry up scrambled eggs in that wouldn't let them stick to the pan. This one is by far the best I've ever used for scrambled eggs. They just won't stick to the pan and scrambled eggs stick to everything!!! I use a bit of cooking spray and that's it, nothing else. This pan is great for frying them up. I just might have to try it for other foods besides eggs which is the sole reason I bought this pan. AAA+++ for non stick!!!"
5,The go-to pan,"I ordered the T-fal as a gift for my daughter after purchasing one for myself. It was worth the back-order wait. The pan heats evenly, resists scratches, has sides tall enough to fry potato pancakes or create sauces, and it cleans easily. I doubted the utility of the ""red spot"" indicator, but it does work. Cook's Illustrated and other reviewers have it right."
3,Pan works well for my needs ...,"However, it was shipped in a Jiffy bag and arrived bent. It is not round, but oval. My lids don't fit it securely. The product is fine. The vendor needs a lesson in packaging."
5,T-fal E9380564 Professional Total Nonstick Skillet,"This is, without a doubt, the best skillet I've come across. After reading the reviews I decided to give it a try and I'm so glad that I did. It heats evenly, is comfortable to handle and it cleans beautifully. What more could I ask for? I liked the first so well that Ie ordered another size and I'm considering a third. I've been using them daily and I couldn't be more pleased."
4,Use it often,I learned of this pan when it was chosen by America's test kitchen as best buy in a quality non-stick saute pan. I agree. It is a good pan. Easy clean up. Heats evenly. I have use it to cook a variety of dishes from eggs to stir fry.
5,Great saute pan,"This is a great value for the price. It cooks evenly, has a soft-grip handle and a durable nonstick finish. Works well for any skillet application. Comparable to much more expensive brands."
3,This is the Cooks Illustrated pan,"The performance is good, with even challenging foods like eggs sliding out with ease (even the rivets are coated with nonstick, a nice touch). However, it's too light for good saute performance, and doesn't sit evenly on my slightly bumpy burner. The late, lamented Calphalon Commercial Nonstick 12-Inch Omelet Pan was a little more expensive, but also larger and much better suited to all-around use.If all you're making are omelettes and other low-temperature foods, this will be a good pan, assuming the nonstick coating lasts. But if all you're making is omelettes, why not go with a disposable pan from Wal-Mart?"
3,Should have listened to other reviewers,"As other reviewers have written, this pan seems to bludge upward in the middle when heated, making it difficult to make an omelet or spread oil or butter across the entire bottom of the pan because it doesn't lay flat. The non stick surface does work great and I do use this pan a lot, just wish it woul lay flat."
3,Bottom not flat,"There is much good to say about the non-stick virtues of this pan. However, on the pan sent to me, the cooking surface is not flat, but seems to be slightly domed in the center. One of the main reasons I use a non-stick pan is to fry eggs in small amounts of olive oil. Small amounts of oil added to the hot pan run immediately to the edges and the eggs slide right to the edge also. The pan is great for omelettes, scrambled eggs, and many other things, but it isn't flat and this is annoying. All non-stick pans are temporary things, and the T-Fal Signature Series skillet I was replacing WAS flat. A lot cheaper too. Especially after Cook's Illustrated's glowing review of the 12.5-inch professional version, I guess I expected more in the 10-inch pro version. I'd send it back if I still had the packaging."
1,Over Hyped Junk,"I Bought this pan in April 2012-yes only three months ago-already it is peeling!I have treated this pan with the utmost care and followed the directions very carefully.now i'm stuck with an over priced piece of junk...Thanks a lot ""Cook's Illustrated"" for your recommendation."
2,Bowed in the middle,"I wrote T-Fal with no response. When I received the pan, I noticed it looked bowed in the middle. I thought it was an optical illusion. When I tried to make eggs in it , for the first use, the eggs all ran to the sides of the pan.They cooked non stick, but the pan is thin, and poorly made."
1,Junk - Warps,The first time I used the pan it warped creating a dome in the center. I heated the pan until the indicating disk in the center turned red as per the instructions. Unfortunately I waited too long to try the pan so I cannot return it.
2,"Non-stick is great for now, but pan loses shape easily","I've bought enough non-stick pans over the years to know to expect the surface to degrade over time so I expect to buy a new one every 18 months or so. Like most non-stick pans, the surface on this one is really great right when its new. However, what I did not expect was how easily the pan would lose its shape. I always wait until my pans have cooled to room temperature before washing them to avoid warping them. I was surprised that after just 2 weeks of use, this pan is no longer flat and circular. I expected the pan to be more durable than it has proven to be. The pan is still usable, but I have purchased others for the same price that have held up better. I will not be buying another one of these when its time to replace this one."
1,Not flat - bows up in middle,I used this 12.5 inch pan for the first time last night to saute some eggplant in a little olive oil and the oil collected at the perimeter of the pan because the pan bows up in the middle. I have never had a fry pan do that before and I did not like it. I doubt I will keep this pan and would not recommend it to anyone that cooks on a normal sized gas stove.
5,"8"" teflon frying pan","This is a great little pan. I've had so called ""non-stick"" pans before, but they were nowhere this good. It distributes heat evenly, browns evenly, and is really ""non-stick"" so far. I have made sure not to use really high heat, as I've found that has ruined ""non-stick"" properties in other pans. Great value for the money!"
2,Not the Pan I hoped for,Bought this pan because of the review of America's test Kitchen. So far I hate it. Its actually humped in the middle not flat. everything runs to the sides. Takes forever to get hot compared to the same temp setting aS my all clad
4,Price gouging,"While I am happy to see this available, it is disappointing to see it for $10 over retail. I spoke to a T-fal representative a couple of days ago who told me that they have thousands of these in their warehouse, but no merchants are placing orders and hence the lack of availability to the consumer. Unfortunately T-fal does not sell direct. I think I will wait until I can find a fair price for this pan."
3,Got one that was domed shaped in center.,"I got one that is slightly raised in the center. I fried some liver mush, and all the vegetable oil just ran to the sides and none stayed in the center. Upon further inspection, the red dot in the center of the pan is what is causing the dome shape. It's just an assembly defect I suppose since others have had the same problem.Other than the problem above, the pan has some heft, and the non-stick properties is really good."
2,Not a good purchase for a flat top electric stove,"With a flat top electric stove the pan is warped enough that it does not make good contact with the stovetop resulting in uneven and slow heating. Non-stick works fine.Even though non-stick pans only last for 2 years, I'm going to purchase a more expensive, heavier pan."
4,Great value,"So far, so great! The pan's non-stick quality is excellent. It can go into ovens up to 450 degrees. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I am waiting to judge its durability."
5,love it!!,I have been wanting to buy a good nonstick fry pan. Read the review in Cookillustrated and found this in Amazon. It is the best that I have so far and the price is really reasonable. Love it!!! I only have it for about 3 weeks. So far so good. Hope the coating will last long.
3,Ridiculously big!!,"I love T-fal pans - they are durable, quality products. However, I was shocked to see how big this pan turned out to be in comparison to the 12"" T-fal I saw in Walmart. I suppose 'Professional' pans are big!!Needless to say I returned it because I couldn't have a pan covering half of the adjacent burner on my stove!Regardless, if size isn't a problem I recommend - go for it. T-Fal doesn't disappoint (I bought the one from Walmart and it's been great)."
2,Pan is too shallow,"I should have paid more attention to some reviews that described how low the sides of this pan are. The non-stick surface is really good, but the sides of the pan are so short that stirring liquid (e.g. scrambled eggs, deglazing the pan with wine for sauce) is almost impossible, without the liquid coming over the side. It would be a great pan with higher sides."
2,Uneven heat distribution,"I really don't like this pan. It's difficult to fry chicken or even hamburbers because it burns in the center, I had a Kitchen Aid non stick that lasted for ten years that had excellant heat distribution. Even then the surface only failed because I left it on the burner too long. There is no question the surface is excellant, but it has very limited use because of the hot spots.I'm really surprised there are not more reports of this problem.I've only had this pan for six months but I may get the Kitchen Aid and put this one in the back of the closet. I'm tired of getting angry every time I use it."
3,Great Pans but why is this pan $10 over list?,"I like the t fal non stick pans and really want this size but went elsewhere to buy it because this 10 1/4"" pan is way over priced on Amazon."
4,As described on America's Test Kitchen.,Great inexpensive skillet. Great non-stick. Saw this on America's Test Kitchen on the Equipment Corner review and had to have one.
5,"""Professional""","This pan is genuinely ""professional"" in both construction and performance. Don't spend money on inferior imitations. This one performs."
1,Not For Ceramic Cooktops - Warps,"I tried this pan based on the reviews.While the non-stick coating seems very good, the pan itself is not. If you use a ceramic cooktop, you already know that many thin pans will warp or dome up/down when heated thereby reducing the surface are in contact with the cooktop. The T-Fal pan is too thin even with the plate on the bottom, and warps upward when heated.This effect causes the pan to be less than useful because the outer edges are the only part touching the stove. Thankfully, unlike other pans I've tried, the dome forms up and not down, so the pan doesn't rock on the stove.My old Farberware Millenium pan has a much thicker plate on the bottom which does not warp under heat. I will have to go back to a similar model."
5,tfal review,12' t fal fry pan cooks like a dream. My scallops were perfectly prepared. Easy cleanup too. Want to purchase more pans in different sizes. Will discard my expensive all clad pan.
4,#1 pick on America's Test Kitchen,I bought this pan exclusively because it was rated the best nonstick for the price on America's test kitchen. They're an independent reviewer of kitchen stuff. I love it. It didn't get more stars because I wish it was a little heavier. So worth the price!
1,T-fal pan Warps,"Warped 1st time we used it.Note that we did not shock it with cold water or otherwise mistreat it.Nice and slick surface but now it rocks on our induction stovetop so I don't think it's heating evenly.After waiting on the phone for 15 min. Customer service says you can send it back at your expense.Meanwhile, I imagine a replacement would warp as well?"
5,T-Fal Professional Pan,Great product! Was highly recommended on America's Test Kitchen television show. I purchased others in the past as well and feel strongly that they are the best buy for the money.
2,"pretty but can""t fight",Handle get very warm even when using low heat I also detected a bit of a smell even after washing well and seasoning. Not the T Fal I remembered I returned the item--I do not trust it.
4,good for what it is intended,great for what i needed it for. cooking eggs and not much else. Typical of all light weight teflon pans
2,Pan sides too shallow,"The T-Fal pan has a great not stick surface , however the design of the pans sides are much too low and shallow. I find myself consistently losing home fries and other things ""overboard "" as I attempt to flip over with a spatula. I am very careful now but I find myself at least a few times a week cursing at the pan as I loose something to the floor."
4,well furnished product,I have been using these pans for about one and haft years and they have held up better than other pans from other manufactures. I had to order this pan. I think stores should have more of a selection.
5,Extremely solid value.,"This is the non-stick skillet you should own. It's not expensive, it's got a great coating, it's huge and it's got a comfy handle. There's not more you can ask for for something that will be used every day and (by the nature of it being a non-stick) will eventually wear out. Did I mention that at this price, you could buy a lifetime supply of these for the price of two premium 12"" non-sticks. Our only beef is that T-fal does not appear to offer a separate lid, but we've got an old one from a completely different set that works."
5,Great Pan,Does everything you would want of a non-stick pan! VERY EASY to clean both inside and out with good heat distribution.
4,So far so good!,"We have had this pan for almost a month and use it every day. So far no warping, no issues with the liquids in the pan running to the edges.The only issue we've had is that when the center red circle shows that the pan is ready, a lot of times it's too hot and will burn what you put in the pan. We only turn the burner up halfway (glass top electric range) but if I wait for the indicator and then put in some butter, the butter will immediately burn. We need to fiddle with it some to really figure out when it's ""ready"" and when it's too hot.Cleans up like a dream!"
4,Very good pan especially for the price,"My only criticism is that it is not perfectly flat - oil put in pan moves immediately to the edges, but I can live with that."
4,Awesome Pan for the Price,"I'll own up to it - I bought this pan because it was recommended by the Cook's Illustrated test kitchen. But it doesn't disappoint. Yes, it will wear out sooner than an All-Clad, but it's also a fraction of the price!The good features: It has a handy heat indicator in the center, relatively even heat distribution, and stays hot while on the heat. It has good weight balance and is easy to flip food while sauteing.The bad features: It's not that solid. If you bang it around, it will dent; if you pound food from a spatula on the side of the pan, it will ding. It won't last as long as a professional pan.Overall, this is a great pan and absolutely worth the $30."
3,ok,Bottom of pan not flat. Oil runs off to outside edge. I still use it but have to move stuff around to keep it cooking evenly
3,"Good non-stick, but warped and useless for certain cooking items","I purchased this pan 7 months ago. The non-stick is great and has retained its properties. However, the pan is elevated in the middle, and oil, pancake batter, liquid egg etc, run to the sides. Warping increases even when heated slowly. Had to buy a different pan for these items. I guess for the price this pan is ok, but I will not buy T-fal again when I need to replace it.Revised on 12/09/2012: I purchased a T-fal A9101562 A8481562 Specialty Nonstick 13-Inch Giant Round Pancake Griddle. It is excellent for pancakes with no warping, larger surface, much better than this pan for the purpose."
3,Good but not great,"This pan is very good, but because it isn't completely flat, I take away 2 stars.When buying a new pan, and paying a few (not too many) dollars, you expect a flat cooking surface. At least for a while. This pan became ""deformed"" after first use! Now when you fry an egg for example, it always goes towards the edges. same thing when using a bit of oil, none of it stays in the center. It all goes to the edges.Now don't get me wrong, heat distribution and non-stick capabilities of this pan are awesome. But like I said, you expect more from a pan that is new.And as always, Amazon performed perfectly with shipping and customer support whenever needed."
5,America's Test Kitchen was right as usual!!!,"I have a 12"" All-Clad nonstick skillet and have been pleased with it for the last few years. Decided to give this a try when America's Test Kitchen reviewed it and replaced the All-Clad nonstick with this pan on the new episodes of the show on PBS. My All-Clad is still in good shape but bought this to have on hand for that day when the finish on the All-Clad is done as all nonstick does.In my opinion this outperforms the All-Clad completely. This has the most even heat distribution of any skillet I've ever used all the way out to the edges of the skillet (my All-Clad never did that!). I find myself reaching for the T-Fal over the All-Clad even over my Calphalon traditional skillets (unless I want to make a pan sauce and need the fond from the pan). At this price I ordered a second one just to have on the sidelines.Love this pan! Can't recommend it highly enough!!!"
5,Excellent Value and Pan,Bought this pan after reading about it on Cook's and have to admit it performs very well for a non-stick. . . has a good weight and balance. . . heats evenly on my largest burner and I can flip the heaviest frittata without a problem and the top (which was the bottom) is beautifully browned. . . have had it several months now and not a single problem with it. . .
3,Seems to take forever to heat up,"The pan is pretty good and truly non-stick. But mine takes so long to heat up, even when I put the gas mark at the highest. Not sure if it has defect, or is it supposed to be like that?"
2,not so hot -- literally,"I haven't used it long enough to tell how durable the non-stick coating is but as a fry pan, it's not great.1. there is no anti-drip lip.2. on an induction cooktop it does not heat up as fast as an Ikea 365 fry pan.3. on an induction cooktop it does not heat up as evenly as an Ikea 365 fry pan.4. As many other reviewers have noted, the pan is not flat and oil drains from the center into a ring.I am quite disappointed by this product after the great reviews on ATK. I bet they didn't test with induction."
5,I love this pan!,Nothing sticks to this pan. Be sure to only use a soft cloth to clean this pan. Anything else will eventually cause you to mark up the surfaces. This is a wonderful pan.
4,Great Non-stick Pan,"The non-stick surface works perfectly. The size is very useful. The handle is safe to touch. The price is right. The only reason I gave it a 4 rather than a 5 is because of aesthetics - it's not the prettiest pan you'll find. But if that's not important to you, then this is the pan for you!"
4,Good Pan,"I have used various t-fal products for years and have always been impressed with the non-stick qualities, this pan is no exception. In addition, this being the professional series the handle grips well and are riveted so they don't wiggle like some some t-fal pans that you have to tighten up about twice a year. They also have a good feel and durable design. I read several ratings saying that this brand didn't work with certain induction cooktops; well I have a NuWave iduction cooktop and the entire set works with them.Other raters say this pan has a slight upward bow in the middle that causes oil/liquid to pool to the outer edges (they are correct). I have a simple fix for this.1. Place the cool un-used pan on a couch cushion or any similiar surface that will give.2. Place the heel of your palm directly in the middle of the pan, apply downward pressure.3. Enjoy.It lost a star only due to the upward bow other than that this pan is perfect."
2,not as advertised,"i bought the 8"", it came without any official 'new' packaging, and the pan does not have the Thermo-Spot Heat Indicator as shown. i have the larger skillet from a different seller that i love!"
5,One of the best saute/fry pans I've used.,"I ruined one of my saute pans and was in need of another. So I went to the wal to purchase, but the quality wasn't there that I expected. The pans are much lighter and less quality. T-Fal from the wal is a lower quality for consumer use, a throw away pan in my opinion. So I went to k*hl's and found this pan. Nice pan but wasn't sure that I was paying too much. Amazon has this great price checking app for smart phones that is a must for price shopping. I scanned the pans packaging bar code and instantly had a hit for the same pan @ 54% less than the *OHL's department store. I was impressed with Amazon's pricing and value. Free shipping and a great product. Well made with heavy bottom, thinner pans burn too quickly. The soft grip handle is much nicer than I expected. Heats evenly and higher quality than the T-Fal Durabase that it replaced. Great product and awesome price. Thanks again Amazon, you hit it out of the park again!!"
5,Great Pan,"I've used this pan about a dozen times so far. I seasoned it with a little oil the first time per the instructions.I have to say, I'm pretty impressed...the omlettes slid right out of the pan with no problems and clean up was very easy. I would definitely recommend it. At under $30, shipping included, it is worth the price and then some!"
2,a frypan too short!,"While the diameter is as advertised, the sides are 2/3 the height of an all clad or similar frypan.....nobody tells you that! A commentator who seems to have all the answers said I should have checked the specs .....there are no specs for the height of the sides.....here it is:Product DescriptionNon-Stick Exterior - Nonstick Interior - Glass Covers - Riveted Silicone Stay Cool Handles - SS Base. Thermo-Spot & Expert Non-Stick Interior 10.25""."
5,great price for great pan,Purchased because I saw it rated on America's Test Kitchen as an affordable non-stick pan at very low cost. Doesn't disappoint.
2,Great nonstick surface but pan is high centered.,"Pour in your oil and you get a thin line of oil where the corner of the pan where the side meets the bottom. Pretty useless, I won't buy another one like it."
2,Way too heavy,Too heavy to get a good grip on with food in it. Needs another handle on the other side. Be aware it has no top so finding one to fit was a big job.
3,"T-Fal 8"" Fry Pan","It was smaller than I expected, a 10"" pan, would have been just about perfect, but the non-stick part is perfect and clean-up is a breeze."
4,Great cookware,"America's Test Kitchen ranked these T-Fal pans as the best among the moderately priced pans. They even performed better than some very well known, well respected manufacturers. Since buying this pan, I've replaced all my skillets and pans with various sizes of this pan."
5,Works Great,Very nice heavy duty fry pan. It sits good on the stove without tipping and the non-stick surface performs excellent.
5,Best Non-stick Pan ever,"After seeing this product tested on America's Test Kitchen, I purchased it immediately. It has completely lived up to the Test Kitchen's predictions. I do not have to use any fat at all to keep foods from sticking and even eggs slide right out. Love this pan!"
5,Wonderful Pan!,We bought this because of the review on America's Test Kitchen site. We are so pleased with it that we will probably buy the rest of the set!
4,Great egg pan,I still use butter or olive oil when I cook with it because my electric stove isn't very accurate. But with a little something in the pan food slips right out. I'm a little confused about the red spot. Other wise very happy to pick this up on sale if I can. Again a review in American Test Kitchen helped me decide to purchase.
2,"great non stick, but not flat","OK, I love this pan's non stick... the CI review and the amazon people were right... however the one I got has a definite ""hump"" in the middle. If you put a tbs of oil in it as per a recipe, it all runs to the sides, leaving the middle dry. if you put eggs in it to fry, same thing. I wish I would have returned it, as no one else has had this issue.... so long story short, check it when you get it, and return it if you get a bum one like I did... I would order another and simply check it for this issue..."
4,T-Fal Professional Fry Pan (10 inch),"An excellent all-purpose fry pan and a good value for the price. Comfortable to handle, and a nice weight without being too heavy to handle easily. T-Fal fry pans sold in the ""big-box"" stores don't seem to have the same sturdy ""feel"" as this one. Not sure if a professional restaurant chef would use it - but for home use I would recommend it without hesitation. The rim of the pan is not non-stick, so every once in a while some food might stick to the rim. Minor inconvenience."
5,Works great!,I do like this skillet. It is just the right size for me to cook my eggs every morning. The Thermo-Spot tells me when it is hot. Love it!!
4,Should be great while it lasts,"Bought to replace a $$$ Circulon pan - coming to the conclusion that non-stick pans are ""wear items"" to be replaced regularly. America's Test Kitchen recommended the T-Fal, so far as slippery-when-new as any pan I've used. Sadly, even on T-Fal's own site I do not see a lid for it or a similar pan w/lid. Good value -- so far - nonetheless."
3,Haven't used it yet; it's sooooo BIG!,"I have a glass top electric cooktop. The pan goes way over what the burner is....but then, I was thinking about it and it would be way over on a gas cooking area too.....so I guess the pan will be okay on my stove.....am I right, or should I send it back and get the 10-1/2????......I'm a single person who loves to cook for my grandkids, etc."
3,Made in CHINA,I thought this pan was made in America but when it arrived it said made in CHINA! Don't we made pots and pans in the USA anymore? I haven't used the pan yet but will add more when I do.
1,country of origin,"just received a t-fal 12.5 inch frying pan, but it is made in China instead of France or USA. Such a pain to wrap it up and send it back"
2,Buyer BEWARE!,"These are made in China, and cheaply so. Passing my hand over the inner surface revealed occasional bumps/imperfections. The handles feel rubbery and cheap. They are certainly worth the twenty dollars Amazon was offering, however they were in my cart when Amazon went out of stock and were replaced by a reseller offering them for three times the price (more than MSRP!!). If it was not so much hassle, I would have returned them. They cannot compare to Calphalons. The only reason I purchased these was because of an independent review which praised the longevity of the nonstick surface. I will update this review to reflect its durability."
1,Expensive Junk,"This product was supposed to be the best.Practically indestructable if well cared for.The red dot turned color when the pan would perform with even heating.The pan was set aside until we went on our next camping trip - 2 years later.From the water damage in the trailer I knew that a little water got in the pan.Big deal, I thought. It should be fine.Professors state that if the non-stick surface is broken that the pan is no good and should be thrown away.Something in the pan itself caused rain water to mold up in bumps that didn't wash away.It had never been used.This is sure a waste of my money for something I need to throw away - never used.DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!!"
5,Best salsa singer ever.,"100% filling and "" Ritmo "" unfurtunated this exelente singer don't have a proper carrier mang. and for that was unable to record no more that this rare jewlery cd. If you like salsa music, you will love Safire.Guido, San Francisco."
3,A Good First Try at Salsa,"Safire has gone from being a freestyle artist in the 1980s and early 90s to being a salsera. With all these former freestyle singers switching over to Salsa (Luis Damon, Brenda K. Starr, India, George Lamond, etc.) I was a little nervous at first as to how she'd make the switch. It seems as though many salseros in the late 90s and early millenium lost their passion and went the electronic beat/synthesizer route with cheesy slow music, but Safire definitely delivers.This album imcludes a duet with fellow freestyle artist, George Lamond as well as a few guest appearances by up and coming Latino hip hop artists. The variety of Salsa and R&B/Hip Hop makes for an enjoyable blend of music to enjoy. This album is definitely geared toward young people. If you enjoy both Salsa and Hip Hop, then this a good choice."
3,They used to be good,"They used to be good and mild. The kids and I both liked them. But then they changed them slightly, and they are too tart now.Good source of dried fruit.I hope they go back to the old recipe."
2,Not As Advertized,"This product's description was definitely incomplete and possibly missleading. Although it was titled ""Fruit Leather"", it is essentially a very thick rectangle of processed fruit flavored plastic-like substance that is very unappealing. Although the price was good, the product was not what I expected or can use."
5,Sweet and Sour.,"Before the Apple, I have tried the Strawberry and Apricot flavors. They all have their own taste and i like to have a variety at home. The Strips are a bit sticky, so you might need to wash your hands after-- but they are delicious :)"
5,These are great!,"Don't let the bad reviews fool you. These aren't sour at all, they are delicious. In fact, I gave one to my son who is 3 (he's a picky eater) and he gobbled it up and even asked for another. I will definitely buy these again!"
2,Not as good as other flavors,"I've tried Apricot which is excellent, but these Apple leathers are not nearly as good. The flavor just isn't there and the texture is a little strange. I've recently ordered Raspberry and Strawberry in order to try those out.Generally these Stretch Island packs are a good value considering individual leathers can sell for $1 or more each in stores such as Trader Joes."
3,Kids didn't like them...,"I thought these were good, but I bought them for my kids' lunches and they did not like them... they thought they tasted too sour."
3,Disappointed a little,"I tried the grape first and loved it so I decided to try these. They are just ok, but my kids won't eat them. Oh well, I'll finish this case but won't buy this kind again."
3,Fake apple made of apple...,"I ate an apple. Then I ate a Stretch Island All-Natural Autumn Apple Fruit Strip.The real apple was better.What should one expect? You take a real apple, process it somehow, then try to reconstruct an ""apple."" Something is missing. The snap of biting a ripe apple. The bulk of the apple in your mouth and stretching your stomach. This product has to be a crude representation of the real thing, the apple for a person who needs to convince themselves that they... just ate an apple.And when was the last time you ate an apple and had to throw the plastic packaging away?"
5,Great Galway,"To my knowledge Galway has recorded these pieces twice; once here with Marriner/ASMIF an once with the LSO. This Marriner performance outdoes the LSO performance by a hair because Marriner put a light under the orchestra's fanny and made the ASMIF call and respond to Galway with spine-tingling logic. Here we hear the fantastic flute concertos transformed from the usual haughty flutters disjointed from the orchestra to complete drama with no unecessary parts. I recommend this CD without reservation, though you should check out Rampal's version (Mehta), Tripp's version (Bohm), and Aurele Nicolet's version (Zinman) as well - not to mention the LSO Galway version, which takes fine advantage of the orchestra's dark-silk sonority."
3,disappointed,"I, unfortunately, thought I was ordering the Jane Goodall recent documentary that benefits her preserve...it was not.It was interesting as most documentaries on this subject are, but nothing really new....I later learned that her most recent documentary and fund raiser can only be purchased in a duo set of a Blu-Ray edition and the usual DVD.......I think this was produced in conjunction with Disney....or maybe I am totally confused....but it was a big mistake to market it in this way. I wanted to order three copies for family members, none of whom are using Blu-Ray...their loss....and I am sorry, because we are all very big supporters of her cause."
4,"Nice, but can be better","I agree with previous reviews that some ordering might need revises from today's point of view, and sometimes the plays in the ""intro"" period of each categories look better than the ones getting a rank.Anyway it is an exciting DVD, containing each exiciting element people watch NBA for. You see great dunks, alley-oops and moves which more specifically for personal showtime, but you can also see hustles, team-works and assists, steals and blocks for the essence of basketball as a team sport and the defensive end.The video and audio quality is just above average --only 2.X GB for over 40 minutes and DD2.0 for audio--, partially because the materails were from earlier ages. For the next release of such titles, I think at lease a 16:9 wide version should be considered -- or even HD-DVD or WMV-HD."
3,should be called best old school plays,"This was a good dvd , but it almost put me to sleep when it had reel after reel of 1960's material. There was a good deal of 80's stuff, and very few 90's material."
5,Worth every penny,"I have to admit it, I thought this seemed like a really expensive business book. I then looked at my bookshelf and realized I had paid nearly as much for the paperback edition of one of the most useful books ever -- the author's earlier THE FIFTH DISCIPLINE FIELD BOOK, which is now required reading in just about every MBA program in the world. Peter Senge seems to me to be in a class by himself. His work is accessible yet challenging, beautiful and inspiring. I agree with the comment earlier that you feel like you are sitting around his dining room table talking about what you can do to make a difference in the world. I'd pay a premium for a place at *that* table."
4,This book has Presence,"It is true that I brought my own high expectations given the Title of this book and its authors. I was not disappointed. It offered less than I expected, in terms of new ideas, but those were deep.Simply the notion of shaping the oncoming future elicits this poem:The star that exploded yesterday,let go so long ago, that no one waitsfor the past to catch up.The future, in all its wholeness,in all its malleable mystery,invites me to be ready.Phil Connell"
3,Presence,"Very interesting concepts that integrate various new age ideas. Makes you think, but too much ""world peace"" preaching."
2,Not the best book from these authors.,"This was a disappointing book, especially for the price. Spiritually-centered leadership is not a new idea and the fragmented ""story-telling"" style of the narrative did not go very far in furthering the model of ""the U."" A really good mental model will help one understand something about 'now' and something about 'what's next'. The predictive power of the 'U' as a mental model appears to me to be negligible. Finally, all of the quotes from their combined Roladex of 'Who's Who in International Business' really didn't help to get their points across."
3,Same book as presence: exploring profound change,"Whilst I really enjoyed exploring pround change (rating of 4), I thought this book was a follow up and was excited to read it. However, when I started reading the book, I realized that is the same book as the first one, but with a different title on the cover page. This is not clear via Amazon or the publisher. So whilst I would recommend the actual book, I am annoyed that I now own 2 copies and feel that someone needs to make sure people know this before they acutally purchase this book. My recommendation to Amazon and the publisher is to clear this up."
4,A life changer,And that is probably all the information you need. This book has changed lives and will continue to do so.
4,Lawless puts away his toys.,"For a long time WASP were considered a bit of a joke band, with their blood & gore, girls & firework attached to cod-pieces!If I remember right, the Sun newspaper ran a campaign to prevent them entering the uk.But it seems with this album they just grew up, creating a thought provoking, innovative, richly textured little rock masterpiece...fascinating."
5,This W.A.S.P. album is great!,"W.A.S.P. is one of my favorite rock groups. So I bought from here The Headless Children album. The album has great tracks to listen too. My favorite tracks are The Heretic, Rebel In The F.D.G., and War Cry. I felt this was the best album WASP put out.The music has great lyrics and rhythm. I just love listening to them. Buy this album."
4,Amazingly accurate...,"I found a lot of valuable information in this book. I have been raising Ball Pythons for years and let me tell you I wish had found this book a long time ago. The information in this book is vital especially because of the ""bad advice"" and ""old wives tales"" that have been circulating about this breed the last decade. A must for all serious ball python owners and enthusiasts."
4,The Best Ball Python Book Ever,This book is very informative.If you want a ball python I suggest getting this book first.It tells you all about feeding setting up your cage and how to handle your snake.The best part of this book was the feeding chapter.It gives you all different kinds of ways of how to feed a stubburn ball python.This book has made it a lot easier for me to take care of my ball python.
5,A great walking shoe.,"This model shoe had a good rating in consumer reports and I see why. If you do a large amounts of walking on flat surfaces this is a good shoe. It is not made for hiking in the woods of course as it is a gym shoe. I had heel pain that went away when I went to this shoe (was using boots on city sidewalks). Likely any gym shoe would have done the trick, but this was a good price and it had the good CR rating."
1,Power drop down,"This battery showed 39% during the first week of use. It now shows only 9% capacity in the second week of use. It can't support the demand of HP iPAQ 6515. Sorry,I need a replacement.Benoit"
3,All you need to know about SLA,"Introduction gives a short descriptions about all (at that time) available RP systems, unfortunately only text, no pics. But, if you're looking for info on SLA and how to use it, this is a book for you. Stereolithography as a method is clearly described (almost in too detalied level) -how it's done, what happens in the process, materials and all. It's all there. Book also describes various applications based on this process. Good reading if you're interested in SLA, but if you're looking for general info on RP&M, this may be a bit too heavily concentrated on SLA for your needs."
2,Love Comes Softly,"I like the series on TV so I decided to read the books. When the characters speak (""All right, Missie,"" Marty whispered ""let us make ourselves a deal. Ya be a good kid, an' I'll do my best to be a carin' fer ya."") it was hard for me to read. Also, the movie was different from the book, which happens, but I know the movies so well that the book was disappointing.I won't be finishing this book. I should have looked at it on my Kindle before I bought the book. My mistake!"
3,Nice Story,"This is good reading. The idea of a woman being forced (by her circumstances) into a convience marriage to a man she does not KNOW -let alone LOVE -is julting. But the relationship which, little by little, grew up between them was delightful to see. Clark was so sweet! He always seemed to know the right thing to say to poor Marty. And little Missy was adorable. My favorite part was when Marty decided to make fried chicken for supper. Easier said than done!(laugh) P.S. Watch the movie, too!"
3,The movie is better,"My only real complaint about the book is that the author chose to provide the characters with an unintelligent sounding dialect, making them sound like the Beverly Hillbillies. Perhaps the writer, as a Canadian, felt that it would add to the rural sense of the location, but I feel that it detracted from the characters. The movie portrayed Marty as a very well read woman and both Marty and Clark were portrayed in a more intelligent light. I also feel that the God/Christian theme of the book was heavy handed, and was handled better in the movie version. Although the book is good in it's own way, it is very different from the movie."
2,"Simple book, repetitive, save your money","Clearly all the high reviews are because it is a ""Christian"" romance, not because it is well written. This is a book an 11 yr old can read. I never felt the ""romance"" between the 2 characters. Very simple and repetitive. Check out Lavyrle Spencer's ""Morning Glory"" if you want a sweet romance with minimal physical contact."
3,I like the movie better.,"My only real complaint about the book is that the author chose to provide the characters with an unintelligent sounding dialect, making them sound like the Beverly Hillbillies. Perhaps the writer, as a Canadian, felt that it would add to the rural sense of the location, but I feel that it detracted from the characters.

I also feel that the God/Christian theme of the book was heavy handed, and was handled better in the movie version. Although the book is good in it's own way, it is very different from the movie."
4,Nice historical fiction,"Great story! I listened to this on CD, so my experience may be a bit different. I watched all the movies in this series on the Hallmark Channel a couple of years ago and they were recently on again which made me want to read them.This story is a great story with Christian undertones (and overtones) throughout. You read the story of Marty, a young woman who's husband unexpectedly passes away as they are moving out west. Marty, on the day of her husband's funeral, reluctantly chooses to marry Clark Davis, a local man with a young daughter who's wife recently passed away. The story is about their new life together and how they deal with living with another person that they only chose out of convenience and need for the winter.If you like historical fiction, and a nice, feel good, easy read, this is a great story."
5,great series!,"this series is amazing! i would recommend it to everyone that loves a good romance. and what is also great, is that these characters that we meet and love, their story continues for generations. read it!!!"
3,Not a FujiFilm Battery,"The pic is an actual FujiFilm battery, the pic being legit and the item not seems a little misleading. (I knew before hand, but wanted to mention it just in case) The battery is about what I expected, unfortunately the lifespan of the charge is not. Battery seems to drain alot faster than my old Fuji Film battery, and that's seen ALOT of use over the years. it's also a little smaller than the old battery (just a tad bit, but it is noticeable in a side by side conparison). This isn't really a good buy, but it does work. looking back I wish I would have spent more and got a legitimate branded fujifilm np80 battery, but hidnshight is 20/20. this still serves a decent backup batt when I need one."
3,"Somali Nationalism by Saadia Touval (1963,Harvard,up)","It can be important for me to get""Somali Nationalism"" and send to my address:Abdi Jama Ali klvervej 15,2mf 6000 Kolding Denmark"
4,Greening Buildings and a Life,"Over the Thanksgiving holiday I read Greed to Green (compliments of the Greenbuild conference in Pittsburgh) and wanted to say thanks to David Gottfried for giving us all such a unique glimpse into his life and times. I've been working to make the jump from conventional real estate to green development and am getting closer everyday. This book could have easily been a boring account of the process involved in starting the U.S. Green Building Council, instead the reader gets an insiders view of the players and exceptional motivation involved in building a movement. Thanks for the inspiration, especially in the ""Greening my life"" chapter; I'm working on it too."
4,Need more live footage,"This dvd is basically comprised of 3 parts: 1) Six songs from the Fillmore show in San Francisco 2) Almost all of Cypress' music videos 3) Superstar documentary/showOverall, this is a solid dvd that is worth the money. My main beef is the fact that they didn't put the entire Fillmore show on it, b/c the 6 performances are off the hook.Having most of Cypress' videos is cool, but I don't really watch them too much...especially the last one with Dre.Finally, the Superstar show is also included. This is basically Cypress' ""Behind the Music"" put on a dvd. Definitely worth watching."
4,How Many Hits Can You Take?,"PROS: The music videos are well done and artistic. The DVD has many great hits, and a lot of videos that you most likely have never seen. The TV Special (30 minutes) is pretty interesting. Quality of sound and picture in all tracks (including live) is great.CONS: Most (if not all) of the music videos have the lyrics edited for profanity. As for the live tracks at the beginning - they don't put on a great show. The live tracks are kind of boring.Overall, the pros outweigh the minor flaws. This is essential for any Cypress Hill fan. It's a blast to watch over and over, especially with friends - just don't buy it for the live performances; they're dissapointing."
5,A necessity to any Cypress Hill fan's collection,"I watched this video from start to finish and it was an intense experience. You'll get to experience what their concerts are like first hand, that is if you've never been to one. It is a definite buy! You won't be sorry! You won't get tired of watching it over and over again, it's a combination of a live concert and MTV."
4,A missing one,"All of the songs are ok. But ""Stoned Raiders"" is missing, it's one of the Cypress Hill's best songs, i wonder why it's not included. If i didn't give it 5 stars, it's because navigation menus are slow. In conlusion, buy it, it's pretty enjoyable."
4,Traditional Bluegrass - All Original,"All new original songs written and performed acoustic by veteran banjo picker from the 70s era Bill Monroe & The Bluegrass Boys. Professional studio recording. Moratto's playing and singing both have evolved beyond what he had then. It's a treat. Also check out his work on the joint Lester Flatt & Bill Monroe ""Live At Vanderbilt"" album, hard-to-find for decades and now reissued on Bear Family CD."
4,Possum on the Halfshell,"I think all the songs on this CD are great ,with catchy lyrics and hot instrumentals. He has a refreshing clear vocal style."
4,Bach B minor review,"This recording is quite lovely. The pace is appropriate, the tone isexcellent. The singing is beautiful. I was disappointed though withthe pronunciation. They are not using the Latin pronunciation but Ithink it is the German. Our chorus always uses the Latin and it is abit off-putting but not enough to make a big difference. I don't knowif I missed seeing this mentioned. If I had, I would have chosen Helmuth Rilling's otherrecording of this piece, which I prefer."
4,Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnet - underdogs?,"It's nice to see NBA Entertainment coming up with a DVD like this that focused on the unsung heroes of the NBA. Noteworthy are the little big men like Spud Webb and Mugsy Bogues, and other ""6th man"" overachievers in the person of Mario Elie, John Starks and Darrel Armstrong. They are the TRUE UNDERDOGS. Would have loved to see Robert ""Big Shot Bob"" Horry or Ben Wallace, an undersized and undrafted center that has become one of the NBA's fiercest defenders and perrenial all-star. Also included in the disc are the greatest upsets, namely Denver's demolition of 1st seed Shawn Kemp-led Seattle in the early 90s and New York's climb to the NBA finals depsite being an 8th seed and injury plagued. Must see for every sports fan."
4,NBA at its best,"I expected the unexpected and got just that... NBA Video explores the greatest upsets and overachievers in NBA history. From the legendary championship run of the 1977 Portland Trail Blazers to the heroic tales of Scottie Pippen and Kevin Garnett, NBA Upsets & Underdogs recounts the NBA's most inspirational stories. Even with the odds stacked against them, these featured teams and players, including host Bill Walton, have managed to steal the headlines with their epic performances. I was truly inspired..."
2,poet too obsessed with being clever,"Chatty,self-involved, too clever by half, these poems are trying to playfully approach serious subjects, but he can't quite get there. Stokesbury seems a poignant example of our involuted poetry culture."
2,a pity,"i tried to like this collection, i really did. it came highly recommended to me by a poet that i respect and whose work i like. but stokesbury just couldn't impress me. most of his poems were confusing, rambling, and just weren't coherent. there were a few clever poems, and ""Evening's End"" is a great poem, definately his best. the collection is weak, but this poem alone makes it worthy to pick up a copy. and you'll find a few other gems in the collection."
5,Autumn Rhythm is a wonderful collection of poems.,"Leon Stokesbury is one of the most original poets now writing in America. This collection, gathered from thirty years of work, ranges from sonnets to surrealism. I have written at length on this collection, and the review is forthcoming in THE HUDSON REVIEW."
3,Nan Goldin NOT Nick Cave,"I'm still trying to figure out why Nick Cave gets top billing on this Nan Goldin book. I have to chalk it up to error. As the liner notes say, this is ""the most significant and comprehensive book to date on the work of Nan Goldin"". That's exactly what this is. If you like Nan Goldin you'll love this book. This is an encyclopedic volume of her images, has to be 1000 pages, it's massive. One of those books you can page through and see something new every time. My only gripe is that most of the photos are printed full bleed, some span 2 pages with the spine cutting them in half, like a magazine."
3,Not convinced about durability,"My problem with this kokiriko is that it is simply stapled to a rubbery strip. I wanted to give it to my 2 year olds, but I think they will destroy it. I really wanted a wood one and the kiddie ones are all plastic. I'm just bummed because I was expecting more from what the first reviewer said. Oh well!"
4,Gets the job done!,"No frills, inexpensive, ""gets the job done"" A/V switch. The construction is a little flimsy but you get what you pay for. I would happily buy this switch again as it definitely fulfills it's purpose."
5,Best Trash Bags!,"I'm shocked to see bad reviews for these bags -- I've been using them since my son was born (2.5 years now) and love them -- I've never had a rip, they hold a lot (poopy diapers!). We tried a lot of different bags and these are the best!"
1,Weak Bags,"We have been using these for 6 months, and to date alot have ripped. We go through one a day, so that will tell you how much we use...They do not have draw strings, they are horrid bags.."
4,"Good dialogue, in depth information, a bit slow in parts","A fan of westerns, I enjoyed the depth of information on Comanche Indians and old Texas. Dialogue was never stilted, writing was proficient. I felt there was a long span of time spent in the desert, would have liked a bit more change of scenery, but it's a minor complaint. This was enjoyable reading with believable characters and talented writing."
1,Poor Poor Quality,"I purchased this light at a local bookstore because I thought the light was rather ""cool"" looking and that the description sounded good. Also thought that since I paid almost $20 it would be good quality. Not so. It casts a weird shadow on the page and just doesn't have a good quality light at all. Took it back the next day. Do not recommend."
1,Not recommended,"I purchased this product from Books-a-Million for the reasonable price of $9.99. Although this book light is quite stylish and petite, it does not do the job. After just a few days of use, I found that reading with it was difficult because it doesn't light up the entire page, it has inconsistent light that flickers between good and poor and the batteries only lasted me a month of hour reading at nights. I was very disappointed and it's certainly not worth the price."
3,Okay light,"This light gives uneven light, does not cover the entire book so that it has to be repositioned often, the light shines back into your eyes, and the batteries do not last long enough for a avid reader. I use it only for traveling, because mine came with a hard case that packs well.Although I haven't tried this one yet, it is probably a better option and Zelco has better designs than most: Zelco 10056 itty bitty Booklight LED Edition"
5,It does what it intends,"Faith cannot be proven. This short book is an interesting read that accomplishes its mission, namely to get you thinking, arguing, and analyzing. You may find holes in his story, good. That means you thought while reading and that is what a book like this sets out to do. Enjoy it, keep an open mind, and remember when religion is the topic, opinion has the final say."
3,Loved it as a child!,"I used to watch this movie years ago as a child because my neighbor friend had it on VHS. I'm almost 26 now and want to see it again very badly. Prices too high right now though. I don't remember all that much of it except for that the beginning when the characters were still children was my favorite part. Wish I had a better review, but like I said, I was just a kid. morganp3"
5,A long way home,I love this movie. I have been looking for this about 20 years. The first time I saw it was on a TV special and I never forgot the story.I still cry when watching.
1,OMNIPAGE 15,"OmniPage does not work, keeps showing this message:“The function you have requested cannot be performed because another program already has control of the device. In the program currently using the device, save any unsaved work, close the program, and try again.”I did not start any other program, and I cannot find any other program running.The instructions in the Users Manual are not easy to follow. The above quote occured when I followed instructions to Get Page."
3,"Four cute puzzles, but...","I have three beefs with this product:1. The lid doesn't have any way to keep it closed. It slides in place, but doesn't lock. This both makes me worry that it can accidentally come open in storage, and it makes it frustrating for my son when he's putting the puzzles together on it and he accidentally slides it.2. Little wood splinters keep breaking off the bottom of the puzzle pieces. This is dangerous for little ones. Thankfully no one has gotten a sliver.3. Some of the pictures on the top of the puzzle pieces have already started coming up; I'm going to have glue them back down.My son does enjoy playing with these puzzles, and at only 12 pieces a puzzle it's something he can do by himself. But the product could be higher quality and better designed. I am disappointed that the pieces are coming apart after less than one month of play."
2,Overrated,"Just seems like regular cardboard puzzle. Overprice since you can find them at discount retails like Marshalls around the holiday for $7. The box it comes with can be a danger to toddlers who try to close it (can close on their little fingers) and then there's the splinter issue with the box. Doesn't come with a big picture of the puzzle which would be nice when putting the puzzle together. Only little picture on the side. Then 4 puzzles in one box makes sorting difficult for toddlers...parents have to help for sure. You can separate them by flipping to the back side where there are shapes to identify each set of puzzle. Still, difficult for younger kids."
3,Not what I expected,The puzzles were a lot smaller than I expected. I also expected the puzzles to be made of thicker material. Overall I wouldn't purchase again.
4,"Nice set, smaller than expected","I purchased this set as a gift for my child's classroom. Obviously I overlooked the dimensions, as the puzzle size was smaller than expected. Despite the smaller size, I know the class will appreciate this and I'm confident they will hold up well."
3,Wood falls apart but great puzzle,"You never know what kind of wood quality will be used with Melissa and Doug puzzles. We have another box set and have never had the problem of small pieces cracking off the back side of the puzzle pieces. My kids love putting the puzzles together, but I am annoyed with little wooden pieces on the carpet that could splinter on a kid's hand."
4,good router / Bad tech support,D-link has the worst technical support team ever. It seems like they have high school students working for them. I take it back. Most high school students probably know more. I returned the product because of their tech support! Not sure if I will buy D-link again. There are many other great network company.
5,CREEPY STUFF,"Writer, Director Francis Xavier will break all rules with his new film ""Johnny Come Lately"". When I first heard that this truly wonderful filmmaker from Baltimnore was in production on a new film. I could only imagined what he had come up with this time. After watching his first film ""Barry's Gift"" at the Maryland Film Festival. I was intrigued to know just how creative you have to be to make an independent film. A film such as Barry's Gift. He is definitely a new voice.Sharon BensonLos Angeles, California"
4,"Helpful, not crucial","Helpful to have this, but there is a glossary in the back of the College Companion. If you want to leave out a resource, leave out this one."
5,Excellent! I learned a lot--and I'm a Muslim.,"I had previously been impressed by Yahiya Emerick's ""Complete Idiot's Guide (CIG) to Understanding Islam,"" so when I saw the CIG for the Qur'an, I had to pick it up. Like all CIGs, it's an easy read. You'll find yourself browsing through the book many times--seeing what catches your eye, as well as reading it all the way through. I'd recommend this book for all--both Muslims and non-Muslims alike. I think pretty much anybody will learn something from going through it. It would also be a great dawa tool, along with the CIG to Understanding Islam."
1,Southern bashing book,"I am getting tired of these liberal authors writing books about southern characters. I knew from page one I wouldn't like this book. It's like a bad southern joke that never ends. The way the girl speaks is completely unreal. She talks like a backwoods hick from the 1930s. It's not common for 16 yr olds today in any part of the country to get married and leave high school. I'm sure it happens, but it's not something that's common in the south. The girl acts like a mental retarded 8 yr old. I am extremely angry that this author portrays a southern girl in this way as if it's typical. I can't believe the author actually gets pad to teach writing. Her skills are lacking. Her characters are phony. There is no depth in her writing. If you want to read a good book that has a similar story read Where the heart is."
2,Save your money on this one...,"The first three fish I enthusiastically spotted and photographed underwater either weren't on the card or couldn't be recognized and it proceeded in similar fashion from there -- and whereas it is perhaps fine for those who already suspect they know what they have seen, it certainly is not a serious reference due to missing species and stages of development and not so accurate pictures. We found we could get a great little waterproof book in a Belize bookstore for a portion of the money as this one card -- and it had ALL the fish and more. Maybe a TWO card edition would be able to present the subject more thoroughly. The card form would definitely be practical."
5,Buy this CD!.... You won't regret it!,"I bought this CD from a store in Las Vegas that was playing the music over the intercom. That's the first time I've ever done anything like that. ""Whoa! What's that music you're playing? It's amazing! Do you have it in stock?"" It was an amazing mix of techno and native american... very easy to enjoy. And then I loaned it to someone and they never gave it back. I don't blame them. Now I can't find anyplace local to sell me a new copy. I've been looking for a little over 3 years now. It's truly a pity that Brule isn't famous enough to be played on radio stations, because he would definitely be popular."
2,A Fusion That Should Have Never Been Tried,"The liner notes are great--the story of Paul Laroche is compelling. This, in addition to the reviews I had read only heightened my anticipation. Imagine my surprise when, after a few seconds, the sound turned pure pop!I'm sure Mr. Laroche is a fine musician, but how can you tell when everything is backed (obscured) by a mindless electronic rhythm section? If I wanted to hear this kind of stuff, I could turn on any modern pop station. One cut is downright techno. Quite frankly, I can't see how Native American chant was expected to blend with the rest of this nonsense. Not that I'm against mixing musical styles, its just that this particular fusion is far less successful musically (trendy rather than quality)than many others available today.The only reason it gets two stars is that some cuts kin of work and this disc is actually better than Brule's others."
2,Short but sweet,"It's hardly representative of Magneto's career, with only 12 tracks featured, but it's an OK place to start. The Mexican import of this disc features 20 tracks and is much more complete is presenting the Magneto story."
4,A standard reference but. . .,"I have no regrets buying General Viticulture. It is, after all, a standard reference. But in many ways it is now a lttle outdated and modern experience and advice is lacking. It should therefore be considered a important part, but only a part, of the basic library of anyone doing or contemplating viticulture.The academic style of writing does not lend itself to the ""do-it-yourself"" approach. The section on laying out a vineyard, for example, is more academic than practical, at least in my opinion. A more modern book would, of course, have better photographs and graphics, and this is what I miss most."
3,A classic that can't be updated,"This is the standard textbook for viticulture in the country and was outdated when I took the class in 1987. Unfortunately Mr. Winkler and other were in their eighties and nineties at that time so the chances of an updated edition were none (Mr. Winkler died before I graduated in 1992.) Yet, even now, I still refer to it for grafting, training and pest and diseases. Hey, just because it's old doesn't mean it's dated. There are some things in grape growing that never change."
3,SoSo,"I read a review that said this was a good replacement for a Radio Shack EC-317. I do not agree. Basic foot and inch dimensions, but fractions of an inch are cumbersome and it does not convert fractions to decimals. Would not recommend."
2,"Works great when it works, doesn't last, no warranty","I received it as a gift and it was great for laying out the footings for my house. A few months later when I went to use it again, there was a big black blotch on the display making it unusable. I emailed Calculated Industries and they told me the only way that could happen was if I abused it or it froze. Neither was the case. They didn't even offer the courtesy of letting me send it in so they could look at it. It still looks brand new except for the blotch on the display. By comparison I have an HP that has literally traveled around the world with me for 14 years and still works great. I wish HP made project calculators!I would not buy anything made by Calculated Industries. Their products don't last and the warranty is absolutely worthless."
4,TWINKLE TWINKLE LITTLE STAR.......,"CONSIDERING the considerable controversy 'about this pic - can'twait to see whatever version is lensing on 8/20.AS we know PAUL SCHRADER started the project and made his version ..... the execs at WB weren't buying .... so MR. HARLIN was invoked ..... WHO KNOWS?We might have a hit .... however, the DVD version later this year should be fascinating - two prequels for the price of 1!That's a head-spinner.Well, not quite - besides having possibly the 'worst' demon make-up on record, the most memorable moments are the real WW2 flashbacks, and the real horrors of human depravity, perhaps rivaling ""The Night Porter"". [Dear, dear, the nasty little things humans do to each other .....]As for the 'Omen inspired' birdies ....... please !Now - when if ever do we get to see Paul Schrader's version?The Harlin version is strictly for laughs ~ no decent demon would go near it!"
1,Ruined a good thing to make a buck,"So like corporate America.This movie had a couple good gore scenes, but shock value alone does not a good movie make.Acting was good, if only the script was worth a poop.Plot was weak. Climax a complete let down.A complete waste of potential.Stupid flick."
1,Gonna be another embarrassment to the series!!!,I didn't really find The Exorcist that scary or inspiring as it wasn't released during my time but I do see how it became a classic.However like The Exorcist 2&3 this film isn't going to justify the strengths of the first one. No film can! It's bad enough that the first two sequels were ever put into production but now they keep making more!The Exorcist is a stand alone film which should be left . . . ALONE!!!
3,Who knows what this will be Like,"Hello, R U all ready to see this movie? In some cases I am, and in others Im not. I'll tell you why. I am a big fan of the first Excorcist; it scared me SEVERELY (but i was only 9 or 10). Its still HORRIFYING! (but i can go to bed now without a nightlight) This movie was absolutely flawless, from the script to the acting and directing. Thats why i can't wait to see it. I can wait to see this movie cuz of what ive seen in one of the sequels (exorcist III). This was one, downright stupid movie. There wasn't anything good about this movie! I never saw #2, but i heard it was just as bad as #3. It SCARES me to think what this one will be like. Since this one is a prequel to the original, and takin place in the MIDDLE EAST, where that one guy discovered the EVIL, maybe it wont be about a dumb investigator finding a serial killer! But who KNOWS. This is gonna be INTERESTING."
2,Does not compare to the original...,"The original Exorcist is the scariest movie I've seen.I saw it when it first came out, and it scared me something awful.Now in my early 30's, no other movie has been able to scare me the same way.This one had very few good parts, but for the most part-I was disappointed."
1,NO!,"How can they ruin such a good story with a lame prequel like this one!?Everyone wanted to know more about father merrin and Pazuzu... where it came from how they meet, but nobody expected such a dumb storyline... Father Merrin is a cross between Indiana Jones and Crocodile Dundee (note the hat). He is a bitter man who has lost faith in God due to the second world war.Somehow they managed to include the Hollocaust in the story...OFF TOPIC MUCH? this movie is filled with Hollywood cliches and the ending is pretty bad. This is an adventure flick, not a horror picture..."
2,Nothing new,"If you didn't see the other Excorcist movies this movie should be reasonably interesting. Unfortunately I did and that's why I think , that this movie doesn't add anything to the other ones. Stellan Skarsgard is a fine actor and Isabella Huppledepup is a nice looking lady and the movie does have some scary moments... thus watching Excorcist 4 can be fun....but skipping this one wouldn't be disasterous at the same time. (SARR)"
3,Stellan Skarsgrd makes the movie,"When this prequel came out all the critics hated it and director, Renny Harlin does have a well deserved reputation for making lousy movies but Exorcist-the Begining is not as bad as you may have heard. Actually, Stellan Skarsgrd, the actor playing young Father Merrin is darn good. He really does look and sound like a young Max Von Sydow. The other actors aren't much but they don't have to be. The whole point of the movie is to show how Fr. Merrin got out of his post WWII funk, got back into the saddle and grew up to become the church's number one demon smiter in time to save little Reagan in the Excorcist. On that level the movie succeeds.Don't sit down in front this thing expecting something great. Don't expect to be frightened or to feel the same way you did when you saw the original because that won't happen. However, if you take this film for what it is-- a B movie then you'll enjoy yourself."
3,ok but falls short,This movie was ok. Although much better than exorcist 2 it fell short of my expectations. First of all it's two hours long and the exorcism only takes place in the last 30 minutes. In the first exorcist the exorcism took months and in this one it seemed to only take a couple of hours. Also ir relys more on make you jump scare tactics then the chilling atmospheric horror that the original displayed so well. All in all this movie is worth seeing but I'd wait for it to come out on video if I were you.
2,Poor excuse,"I loved the original movie, however, this one is a far cry from the religous and psychological terror that you were given in the orignal movie. In this one you will get tons of Hollywood effects and a horrible plotline that pretty much states that it is to cash in on the original's success. Although, this movie does have its moments it never truely gets out of the gutter on the horror genre."
1,WHY DID THEY BOTHER?,This movie was amazingly bad. With all the FX and beautiful scenery at their disposal you would think a workable script might have been somewhere to be seen. But no. Quick cuts and a dull plot killed this movie. The original is still the best.
5,How DO you rate a movie you've never seen?,"I'm not psychic...but I do know a thing or two. Like throwing off the User Rating of a film before it even premieres with the combined results of over a dozen ""movie critics"" who rate them before seeing them. Rating a movie based on your personal feelings of whether or not it was a good idea to even make it in the first place? Oh, please, dear Amazon, either toss these reviews out or put them in a seperate voting category labeled ""Unseen Movie User Ratings"".Ooopsies! I gave it 5 stars! Oh well...I didn't see it. Maybe it'll be good and my review will count."
5,An All Around Excellent Movie!!!,"This is an all-around excellent movie. Not only is the production competent, but the cinematography is superb, and the acting is excellent also! In fact, I think that this is THE best incarnation of The Exorcist that has been made up to this point!Yes, people complain about the amount of gore in this movie, but it's not that bad; Excalibur, released in the early 1980's, is even worse!The main thing that I like about this firm is the manner in which evil is portrayed; it is bad! Good is white, and evil is black."
2,EXCORCIST-the beginning: Hopefully the end!,"I liked some parts of the movie-but the ending was sooo stupid and corny. In fact it ruined the entire movie. I had the feeling that the last parts of the movie was written within a half hour without much thought. It totally ruined the entire movie. The excorcism was totally corn right off the cob. I thought how utterly rediculous.It had some gore here and there-a dead baby born with maggots all over it, and there was a kid that got ripped apart by these wild canines.My gawd it was a bad movie because of the ending. If I would have paid money to watch this in the movie theatre, I would have been extremely angry to have wasted my money and time. I rented the DVD and was entirely disappointed. I felt I lost a few dollars and wasted my time watching this lame movie. If you plan to buy it - well, you were warned."
3,And let my cry come unto thee...,"I think EXORCIST III: LEGION is an undiscovered treasure, as it is the true Blatty-penned sequel and was directed by Blatty himself. This remains true to the ""Version You've Never Seen"", as it was more Blatty's view of the film than Friedkin's. Now onto THE BEGINNING. If Blatty was involved in anyway, as I heard he was to be originally, then I have faith the prequel will be well done. However, with anyone else writing it, it may suffer the same fate as HERETIC, which is good for a laugh every now and again."
5,The Exorcist,"I gave this five stars because of personal bias. It's my favorite horror film, and the extended version pleased me to no end. I still get a shudder, or two, everytime I watch it. And, being Catholic, I am aware of the Church's view on this ancient rite of Exorcism. If you have a strong stomach and like the hell scared out of you, get this version of The Exorcist. Good to watch on a stormy, windy night with the lights turned off, or on Halloween."
1,"""This is the place where the Church thinks Satan fall""...","....I can't believe tt a character in the movie said that.This is so lame it hurts.This movie confirms tt Hollywood has ran out of ideas.The acting is poor, the story is terrible, and the demon at the end of the movie....come on...(he only appears for 15 minutes).Movies like these should be forbbiden.Even a review of this crap is a waste of time.Don't see it. Trust me."
1,Wish I could give it 0 stars...,"Exorcist: The Beginning is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't see how anyone could possibly enjoy this movie. The original Exorcist is a very terrible film too. I was so dissapointed when I saw it for the first time. I was expecting a 4 star horror film, but all I got was a new, quick way to fall asleep. I haven't seen II or III, but I definetly don't recommend The Exorcist or Exorcist: the Beginning."
4,The Exorcist,"I have not yet seen this movie, however as soon as it is available to buy I will do so. But the best Exorcist movie I have seen this far is the movie ""Possessed"" starring Timothy Dalton as the pastor performing the exorcism. Based on the movie extras, and the shows I have seen on TV, this is the closest movie based on the actual events of the true Possession."
1,The power of the original compels you!,"Gotta see it! Although, after seeing the remakes of dawn of the dead and texas chainsaw massacre (obvious landmark classics) and wondering what the writers and directors were smoking, im not going into this prequel expecting too much. But of course (and hollywood knows this) every SERIOUS horror fan is absolutely obligated to see the film."
2,The devil never made me laugh so much,"I went into this movie knowing it wasn't going to be that good and i left feeling the same way. It wasn't scary, except one or two moments when your caugh off guard. To me this was more like a mystery than a horror flick. The sound effects were silly and at times the dialogue was absurd. The female doctor was very attractive so that was at least one bonus, ofcourse she didn't look so hot when she was possessed by the devil. Maybe if i was really drunk i might consider, nah, probably not. Anyways if you wanna kill two hours be my guest but don't go into the movie house with great expectations because you will be pissed off for wasting your money. Oh, the animals that attack people were not realistic at all. You could clearly see they were computer produced, even their physical movements were unnatural."
1,"Slow, Boring and Stupid","I'm thankful I only wasted $4.00 to rent this movie rather than more money to see it at the theatre or buy it. The pace was SO SLOW - I thought the movie would never end. Very dull. Characters not well developed - I didn't find myself caring what happened to any of them. Granted, I may have missed a little something as I fast-forwarded through the last 45 minutes (didn't want to completely waste my money - I at least wanted to be able to feel like I tried), but from what I saw, it was highly disappointing and just a poorly revamped version of many other better movies."
5,A worthy prequel,"Father Merrin (Stellan Skarsgard) is a priest that witnessed terrible things in WWII. He has lost his faith. He joins an archaeological dig in Kenya. An ancient Byzantine Christian Church has been found in pristine condition. Under the church a satanic alter is found, and a demon possesses a boy. Father Merrin tries to help the boy and the villagers, but it may take his life in the process.This is a very good movie. It gives you a look at the famous Father Merrin and his past. The acting, special effects, and screenplay are very good. The film isn't as frightening as the original, but it's very powerful nonetheless. IF you like the original movie then this one will probably make you happy. You may want to check it out."
1,Exorstink,"I wouldn't say I had high hopes for this but I at least expected it to be decent. It wasn't. I was falling asleep for the last 20 minutes and absolutely couldn't wait for it to end it was so dull. I like watching scary/horror movies in the dark in my basement near Halloween and that's twice now that Exorcist sequels completely disappointed me. Very heavy handed, it was almost like watching one of those horrible ""Friday The Thirteenth"" movies where the music is used to make you think something is going to happen which of course you know it's not. This was pathetic. I'd never sit through it again."
3,Worth a look,"Perhaps like many, I believed the negativity surrounding this movie and stayed away. I finally sat down to watch it last night, fully expecting a disaster. To my pleasant surprise, with the exception of some ordinary effects (which aren't required to make a movie good anyway), I thought this was quite a well made film. Without question the highlight is the performance by Stellan Skasgard. A thoroughly believable young Merrin. Indeed, most of the acting was more than respectable. Nothing will ever compare to the original, however this is by far the next best offering from the Exorcist franchise. Looking forward to seeing the pre - Renny Harlin version for comparison."
4,Father Merrin - In The Beginning,"I've always liked the Exorcist and I was surprised to find that I liked Exorcist - The Beginning since I didn't like the two sequels. This movie certainly isn't for the squeamish. There's more blood and gore than I've seen in a long time. Not to mention bugs.. flies, maggots, butterflies.. they're everywhere.I thought it was interesting to see the 'history' of Pazuzu. You see the small statue in the original movie but there's nothing mentioned of it.I didn't have high expectations of this movie so I wasn't disappointed. I actually enjoyed it. Well.. everything but the birth scene. Yuck."
1,"Satan, get thee down. . .",". . . and take this stinking movie with you. I should have known better, but I'd heard that this was the first movie filmed in high definition, so I wanted to see how it looked. WELL, IT LOOKED LIKE CRAP! AND IT SOUNDED LIKE CRAP! BECAUSE IT IS CRAP! The DVD doesn't even have any menu extras - that's how bad this movie is. Not that a spoof reel would have saved the film, but at least it would have been appropriate. This is without a doubt the worst presmell of all time. If you value your soul, as well as your wallet, then stay away. Far away."
4,The Exorcist IV,"The latest in the long running Exorcist series, this fourth entry was billed as a prequel but actually is going forward and happens right here. The budget appeared to be about 1.5 million dollars, most of which didn't go into paying the actors but into the sets. Catholics liked, but not loved this one. Out of all the Exorcist movies this one at least used modern technology to make it. A priest loses his faith and joins an African excavation, uncovering a church. This plays more like a drama than a horror film. There was one demonic possession scene at the end where the demon is forced out. It was not bad."
3,Know the Director,"Seeing how Renny Harlin directed the films Deep Blue Sea (1999) and Nightmare on Elm Street 4, it might be pretty good."
5,This movie is so awsome,"I love this movie!!! The performances are superb, I love the direction, the music is haunting, and all those bozos complaining about the bad CGI I have to say are nitpicking because the CGI is very limited, plus it is most of the time shown in dark atmospheres where it is hard to see anything anyway. All I have to say to bashers of this movie is move on and stop bugging the people who actually enjoyed it....great movie!!!!"
3,"Slow, a bit dull, hard to hear dialogue, whispering ugh","The movie didn't hold my attention closely enough in the beginning and later it hurt my understanding of what the heck was going on. It was just a dull start to the movie, nothing to hook into.And also the dialogue was awful, not enough of it, and everybody was always whispering so we couldn't hear what was being said.Overall I would rate it better than Exorcist 2, but not as good as the original, nor the Omen and its sequels.The star who played the lead was very good toward the end when fighting the possessed one. I liked him very much and will look for more of his work."
3,"Not bad, but unworthy of the original.","This movie is a manic, scene to scene scare fest. Blood flows, gross out scenes are everywhere.Some of the film is well done, but ironically... the strong points to this film are borrowed from the unreleased film ""Dominion.""The ""Regan"" style possession at the film's conclusion is a guilty pleasure... once again meeting the vulgar, blasphemous, profane, sarcastic, white eyed hag from the original.But on this theme, the film actualy plagerizes scenes from the orginial! Scenes showing a blacksmith, detailing the movements and mannerisms of psychiatric patients, etc. The copying of the original transcends any typical ""homage.""Weaknesses of the film include fake looking CGI effects and animals, and a far too powerful demon (Spoiler) who seems to be victorous in the end. Like Exorcist 3, it's actually too depressing.But as a thriller, it does work.Jeffrey J. Messenger, author of ""The Shroud of Torrington."""
4,Good vs. Evil .. A good story .. for the soul & mind,"From all I read this was to be a real bad movie, well no, it's not a bad movie. I found, a great story of a soul lose but, yet at the end of the story, reborn is the soul to God,love,& faith well told story. Yes a begining to what is to been ""The Exorcist"" the horror movie classic of all horror movies well done. But it not ""The Exorcist"" but, yet it's still a start to the horror."
5,An excellent prequel to the origional.,"This film is very well made, story follows along perfectly, never a dull moment, great effects, twists, amazing possession effects, and scary as hell just like the origional. I have all the exorcist movies and they are all great but this is the best since the first."
2,READY FOR A GOOD SCARE DONT GO SEE THIS,"ALL I CAN SAY IS I GUESS THE CHURCH NEEDS A SUPER HERO TO TAKE OUT EVIL DOERS TOO. GIVE ME A BREAK , THIS MOVIE WAS SO UNBELIVEBE SO UNREALISTIC, SOMETHING SO UNREAL NOTHING LIKE THIS COULD NEVER HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE.THE ONE THING ABOUT THE ORIGINAL WAS THAT SOMETHING LIKE BEING POSSED COULD HAPPEN AND DID HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IS GO BACK TO THE BASICS TO MUCH COMPUTRIZED CRAP THAT TAKES AWAY FROM THE STORY LINE AND TAKE AWAY THE REALISM OUT OF MOVIES TODAY.THIS MOVIE WAS NOT THAT BAD BUT IT WAS NOT THAT GOOD EITHER I AM STILL WAITING FOR A MOVIE TO SCARE THE HELL OUT OF ME LIKE THE FIRST EXORCIST DID IN 1973 WAS SO REAL THAT IT MADE PEOPLE FAINT PASS OUT JUST PLAIN WALKOUT OF THE MOVIE. WE HAVE NOT HAD A SCARE LIKE THAT IN A LONG TIME BUT IM STILL WAITING"
4,Let pray for a Miracle,"Well it's comming close, you can't change a classic, and the others like II and III just didn't live up to the strong first story. I am hoping that they didn't forget what scared us that is what we want to see, visions and hints of something so dark that it could infect a young inocent girl, is what scared me.Let's just see if they could pull this off again, or at least have a decent story to tell."
1,EXORCIST URSLEF RENNY HARLIN!!!,"Is this a joke? Or is another Jason X ,or Jason Vs.Freddy B.S? Or soon they come up next year with ""EXORCIST X"" Or ""EXORCIST V.s OMEN""???...Please stop making these stupid parts and version of the original movie.U cant top that,And SUCK every time.!"
4,Some very scary moments,"I went into this movie with thoughts of everyone elses reviews in my head, but although a little slow I was pleasantly surprised. This movie had some good moments of fright. A couple of scenes had me jumping!The build up was excellent and the ending I had never guessed!It's not the original, but it's worth the admission!"
2,not that bad but not that good either,till this day i havent found a horror film that tops the original exorcist.you dont need blood and gore to make scary. just give the public a face of scars and their set for life. this movie is not that good but the original was excellent.
3,Standing in the shadow of a very famous movie,"It's hard to do follow up movies to a legendary flick like the exorcist and this movie will suffer by being compared to the original. All in all, it is an okay movie to watch when there is nothing else on tv. The story is okay, but the movie comes across as choppy. Sometimes it is trying to be a psychological thriller, sometimes an action flick. Some of the computer generated affects are tacky."
1,I thought I'd like it....,It's great for about one hour then the batteries die. I replaced the batteries and they were dead a little while longer. I may have a defective one.
5,can't do without it,"...but I have for a year now. My dog actually ate it and I've had a hard time trcking it down. It is absolutely the most relaxing, inspiring, meditational music I've ever laid ears on. It truly does help 'center' people. Nothing has suited me since. I highly reccomend it!"
2,BUYER BEWARE,"SDS bits are for chiseling and masonry and require and SDS chuck (bit holder). Regular wood or metal drilling bits use a standard chuck. The description says you can easily select between hammering, chiseling, or drill only mode but the standard drilling chuck is not included with this drill. I confirmed with Dewalt that this model only comes with the SDS chuck, so you will not be able to use wood or metal bits without a separate adapter."
5,Tintinophile,"I have EVERY Tintin book printed in English, and some in other languages. I'm probably not the best reviewer because I love all of Tintin and Herge's work The artwork in Tintin in Tibet is especially lovely, and it is a good story of friendship - between Tintin and Chang as well as Tintin and Captain Haddock. A great read."
5,"Exciting, fun and educational introduction to Tibet, its beautiful landscape and Buddhist culture","After Tintin's friend Chang's plane crashes in the Himalayas, Tintin refuses to believe he is dead, and launches an expedition to find him. Along with Captain Haddock and Snowy, he travels through New Delhi and Nepal, before getting to the mountains. In Tibet they experience the hazards of mountain climbing, the gentle Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and the Yeti, before rescuing Chang.My favourite Tintin book is fun and educational for both kids and adults, quite often being people's first introduction to Tibet, its beautiful landscape and culture.In 2006, Tintin became the first fictional character to be awarded the Dalai Lama's Truth of Light award."
3,review of Tintin in Tibet,"I've read all the Tintins in English except for the first two, and Tintin in Tibet is one of the most boring. It may not be boring in itself, but compared to other Tintins, it is. The best thing to do is to read other Tintins, such as Blue Lotus, which also features Chang. Blue Lotus, by the way, is my favorite Tintin adventure."
5,Tintin at its best.,"I just finished In Tibet for perhaps the 20th time and I still find it as funny, poignant and suspenseful as the very first time I read it. I see that my fellow reviewers have provided a very nice summary of what the episode is about so I will not go into the plot. But take away the exciting physical dangers of killer avanlanches, sheer cliffs, airplane crashes, rapids, and an abominable snowman (!), the real essence of the story is what really remains in your mind: the wonderful and loyal friendship between Tintin, Captain Haddock, Chang, Tharkey and of course Snowy. Tintin in Tibet is a true classic of the series and a masterpiece for Herge."
2,"Not Awful, But Disappointing","What takes a nice idea and doesn't run very far with it? This slots program. With so much hype and glitter in contemporary slot machines, the promise of ""old time"" machines struck me as welcome. They claim to offer great variety by presenting a whole bunch of different ""casinos,"" but they're all virtually identical, with nothing more than a slightly different look to the face of the machines from one to the next. The ""riverboaty"" music is pleasant enough, but, of course, repetitive--and not what you've bought the program for. Graphics are also OK, but not up to the better slots offerings. All in all, very little real variety here--and not something you're likely to enjoy very much for very long. You can do better."
3,Riverboat Slots (Jewel Case),"The riverboat slot.. It was not what i expected, but i except it. The riverboat was more like something i had not played before."
3,YUM! but not craveable,"These were tasty...you don't get a BREAD taste per se...it seems more as if there are bits of salt in the chocolate. Which was good. But not cravable enough to order again and pay the high price plus ridiculous shipping cost. If they showed up at a local store I might buy a couple, but I would not seek them out. Would rather have homemade bread with Nutella on top."
5,A great book to read late at night...,"Excellent book dealing with aerial hauntings, phantom aircraft, and unusual sightings made by pilots. Very entertaining (the one ""ringer"" story reported in the previous review notwithstanding). Very disappointed to hear the follow up was never completed. If you enjoy true stories of unusual events, with a emphasis on aircraft and the pilots who flew them, this is the book for you."
5,COMPLIMENTARY,"I first saw this artist in the movie "" DANCE WITH ME "". Shortly thereafter I purchased the movies soundtrack. I then fell in love with his music, and Latin music in general. I find his music Sensual, Passionate,and Smooth. It is true that music can transcend many barriers. I do not speak, or understand Spanish at all, but I love this music ,and Chayannes music particularly."
2,Not for new fans !!,"Don't be mislead into thinking based on the release date that this is new material it's basically a rerelease of ""Down to Earth"" with a couple of songs from ""High Cumberland Jubilee"" added for flavor (Before the Beach pt 2?). If you're a newer fan interested in JB's early material this is a great album due to it's low price. But understand this is most likely not the music that gave you your Fin and Feathers..."
1,Jimmy Buffet you are dead to me,"Wow, this has got to be the worst thing Jimmy has ever done!! It's extremely amateurish-sounds like he made it in his garage before taking singing lessons. Why would someone so good put out something so bad? Don't waste your time or money on this piece of crap!"
1,THESE OTHER REVIEWERS MUST HAVE WORKED ON THIS TERRIBLE FILM,Do NOT waste your money. This is one of those movie scenarios when you instantly know that you want a refund within the first minute : (
4,Dino fun,"My 3yo got them for Christmas last year, and the Pterodactyl's head popped off within the first week. Besides that, these dino's are great. My son still plays with them."
4,fun but overpriced,"My 3.5-year-old son still enjoys playing with his set, which he's had for over a year now. He enjoys playing alone with them and also with friends (it's good to have so many pieces, and 2 T-rexes). The pteradactyl's head should be made so that it can turn, rather than being affixed at an awkward angle (it's just begging to be twisted off, which my son promptly did). My son likes to make the T-rexes (which have movable jaws) ""bite"" things--so one of them is missing some teeth. I like that the dinosaurs are kinda cute (though the T-rexes were a little scary to him at first), I feel the cute:scary ratio is age-appropriate. However, when I paid twenty bucks for it I thought it was overpriced for (not very durable) plastic with few moving parts, so the current price seems outrageous."
4,Humor avoids bias,"If the material in this book had been approached with a dogmatic view of gender politics this could have been a miserable read. The author's sense of humor about gender issues was refreshing and seemed to allow her to approach the sometimes controversial issues with an unbiased attitude. The chapters on hormones were very interesting, and the stories of children chasing the family cat with a toothbrush turned into a toy gun were quite funny. A lot of thought provoking material is compiled from scientific studies done around the world."
4,Nuggets of information to be mined,"I would agree with some of the points made in previous reviews, the chatty style can be irritating when you just want the information. That, however, is probably a lot to do with my gender bias, I am a male scientist and I like cold facts so bear that in mind. Having said that the book does deride male qualities which, as a male (Maxim reader) I found annoying.But don't let any of those comments put you off of reading the book, it has some very well researched points and from a research point of view it will be a valuable asset for me. I actually got the book from a library and read it and I am now going to buy it so I can refer to it when I need it. That must be a good recommendation I suppose!"
5,A must read to understand better gender differences,"I found this book both easily readable and filled with valuable information. Ms. Blum's ability to weave stories into the scientific data allows the reader to relate the information presented to real life. I have found I remember parts of this book very clearly and have enjoyed sharing with others what is a very universal topic- male and female gender differences with a bite of science. The studies she references are fascinating...I appreciate the backbone of science as opposed to speculation or opinion, which describes much of the literature on this topic. A book well worth seeking out and reading."
4,Interesting but not totally convincing...,"A lot of fascinating theories are explored in this book, and there is a great deal about biological gender differences that can be learned from it. Yet however interesting it may be, the fact remains that it is written by a journalist rather than a scientist, one who is well-versed in the scientific data and who can easily convey it, but not someone who has carried out any of the research.I somehow got the sense that, throughout the book, I was reading some personal opinions of the author's and not simply an objective discussion of gender differences. I do not think that this prevents the book from being worthwhile or educational, but it did leave me feeling a little unsatisfied and skeptical about some of the conclusions that were drawn."
3,Interesting but somewhat biased,"For the most part I think this books is interesting. It readable presents and explores results concerning the differences between the male and female brain. However, there is a strong bias on the author's part toward the notion that humans are evolving to be more and more monogamous as if this is the ideal state or that evolution is somehow directed. Also, throughout the book the author always seems to be vaguely deriding male versus female qualities."
3,Not as good as the hype,"I bought the book after I heard the author speak on the local NPR station's talk show. She was more interesting, more informative, and much less verbose than in the book. There are other popular books on the biology and evolution of the human sexual functions, and this one does not stand out from the crowd. Somewhat of a let down."
2,somewhat disappointing,"if you've never read anything on evolutionary psychology before you may enjoy this. however i found the chatty journalistic style irritating. The author frequently includes her personal feelings and opinions about the research, which gets boring. Also, she panders to the sensitivities of readers who might find the material upsetting. I preferred ""The Evolution of Desire"""
1,Hack,"Blum has no writing ability at all, since she has none her ideas are very poorly expressed on a subject which will only be of relevance to feminist fundamentalists and their allies seeking a biological basis for restrictions on creative expression and individuality, whether pro-lifer Naomi Wolf or corporate welfarist's at the New York Times seeking help in the managerial hierarchy. Boring."
1,Brain Sex Revisited,"Do you see how all these books are so similar? .. doesn't matter if it is Venus and Mars or Brain Sex,they all have the same theme ""difference"" and unfortuately a controversey hungry public just eats them up.,one after another.It must be that similarities,individual needs and desires aren't interesting enough so the theme stays stagnant and we to neauseum,find our book stores brimming with gender bias books which look as though they have all borrowed material from one another..Since there are so many variations in the human population,to write gender bias books to begin with seems pointless,unless the underlying reason is to make financial gain and promote an agenda of deceit and discord among men and women."
1,MISLEADING TITLE / SORT OF A RIP OFF,"I BOUGHT IT EXPECTING A COLLECTION OF OLD SHERLOCK HOLMES MOVIES, NOT PARODIES, CARTOONS AND MONKIES. IT MIGHT BE WORTH THE MONEY IF THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR BUT IF IT IS OLD SHERLOCK HOLMES MOVIES THEN THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY. THE TITLE IS VERY MISLEADING AND I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH IT"
1,ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN AVAILABLE BEFORE,"About eight years ago I bought a DVD collection from a publc domain company calledBuyer's Gallery out of Canada. They sold their silent Holmes' films in two separate sets each containing extras such as Sherlock Parody films, cartoons, etc.The quality of the original sets I bought were quite good but I was hoping that with this one advanced remastering might have improved the titles. After the watching the set it did not take long to realize frame per frame ""IT'S THE SAME FILMS"". It's obvious where they were taken from.Needless to say I'm beyond disappointed. But being puiblic domain footage I guess that there's nothing stopping them from taking another companie's work.Maybe someone will come along one day and really do these films justice"
5,a treasurable anthology,"""Sherlock Holmes, The Archive Collection"" is an absolute treasure! I had previously seen some of the films from this compilation but ""The Sting Of Death"" (with boris Karloff as Mr Mycroft) is a gem plaid with first rate actors. Of course one can see the painted backgrounds shake when the actors brush against them but well, it's part of the fun. And I had just finished reading ""A Taste For Honey"" from which the film was made..The cartoon is crazy but well animated, The string-puppet show (Lime Juice Mystery) is a catastroph, but nave enough to be lovable.Arthur Wontner and Ellie Norwood episodes are quite good too and absolutely new to me.I only regret the last thirtyish minutes bonus put there just to have something of Basil Rathbone in the bunch.It is essential for a true Sherlockian, to have this 3-disc set in his files!"
2,Good Sherlock Homes,The made for British tv Sherlock Holmes is good but not great like the movies staring Basil Rathbone. The transfer to DVD is rather poor on a lot of the episodes.
2,Not What I Expected,I was very disappointed that only a few of these episodes are actually Sherlock Holmes. The title and packaging is very misleading.
2,"Good general information,but not for the test","I used this book and MCSE:Fast Track, both highly rated, plus the Transcenders, to study for this exam and none of these came even close to what's in the test. I studied well for this and passed 5 tests previously, first try. This book is far removed from the scope of the test. I gave 2 stars because I think it is good for general information and will work well for reference, but don't rely on it for the test. There's nothing about ODBC errors and minimal about SMTP and NNTP configuration. It tells how to set up virtual directories and webs and so on, but leaves terminology unexplained. I learned too late that it is not extensive enough, even with the other 2 study materials, to pass this test. Not even Transcenders helped for this one."
3,"Good Material, Easy to understand, a few errors though.","IIS for Dummies is a good place to start learning about IIS but it should not be the only book you use to study. The author puts together a good outline for taking the test and what the test expects, but it can't replace the valuable information you could get from an instructor led course. The test contains simulations of IIS administration which the author does not mention. The book does includes a CD with different types of practice tests (the author claims NT Option Pack 4 is included as well but I could not find it). This book is for readers who want to know the basics of IIS and with what the exam expects you to be familiar. If you can afford it take a class, because that's the only way to become familiar with the look and feel of IIS 4.0."
5,"Daaah, dith hear buche wuz gude fer me!","Failed the IIS test twice after studying with other books. Bought this book and plunked down the dough for Transcender questions and passed!I've purchased a total of three Dummies books for three different exams, and they have not failed me yet. I am a fan!Anyone who wants a study partner, email me!"
3,Only a Game,"Robert Daley's six years as publicity director for the New York Giants pay off in this well-grounded novel about an aging halfback who feels his career, image, and sense of personal satisfaction slipping away. That this loss is dramatized through an extra-marital affair seems convenient and melodramatic, especially since the two women are superficially drawn, but the fading hero's sense of loss is acutely felt and the pro-football background of the pre-Super Bowl era is persuasively presented."
5,Robert Daley At His Romantic Best,"WHEN I FINISHED READING BOB DALEY'S Only A Game I WAS SAD. NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE BOOK WAS OVER, BUT BECAUSE DUKE CRAIG AND MARGIE BERGER WERE VICTIMS OF FORCES MORE POWERFUL THAN THEMSELVES, NOT UNLIKE Romeo and Juliet.LIKE SHAKESPEARE'S LOVE TRAGEDY, ONE FEELS THEIR ACCUMULATING SORROW, BUT WE'RE ALSO DISTRACTED BY THE EQUALLY POWERFUL STORY BEING PLAYED OUT ON THE FIELD WHERE DUKE'S OTHER LOVE, PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL, IS ALSO COMING TO ITS DRAMATIC CONCLUSION.WE'RE TEMPTED TO STOP FOLLOWING THESE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS, BUT WE'RE UNABLE TO. WE WANT THEM TO LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER AND DALEY KEEPS US GLUED TO HIS BOOK UNTIL WE LEARN IF THEY DO.John Robben"
5,Great cordless impact driver,"Very powerful 18 volt cordless impact driver. I use it all the time on farm equipment, change the blades on lawnmowers, rotate tires etc. Very useful product. I would defintely buy again!"
2,Dewalt impact Wrench,"Poor torque and charging power... returned the unit the first week. Bought the Sears Craftsmen Unit... more money, but far superior."
5,I hate to be just another fan but....,Its rare I give 5 stars and I really enjoyed this.Out of all the manga I've read just far (Im just getting into it) this was the most interesting and easist to understand.Already ordered the second one! =]
4,Interesting Manga,I am not a regular manga reader but the basic story seemed interesting enough so I gave it a try. Now I am hooked on to it.
1,Chad Kroeger should use a Death Note and kill all the people who made this.,"I read this manga and I got infuriated. Not only is the plot tripe, bland, unoriginal, and above all TL;DR, but the whole Shinigami Eyes premise is a total ripoff of the music video of Nickelback's masterpiece, ""Savin' Me."" Nickelback should sue. And how come this reads from right to left? This is America! We read the right way!"
1,Reeeeeeeeeal stupid plot,"I read the first chapter of this in shonen jump and ho-ho-holllllly crap it sucks!!!!! there is barely any plot! all light does is go around killing people! this is probably written by some person who is really into morbid stuff! I mean I am kinda into doing stuff where I pretend in a game where people die, but writing an entire manga about it? I mean come on! get a hold of your self!!!!! go buy some other shonen jump manga.Like I don't know....maybe Naruto or Dragon ball z or one piece. It really really sucks. Don't buy it. It is a waste of eight bucks. really,really sucks. it's just sad.."
4,Get it at Your Local Dollar Tree,"This animated version of Hercules is produced by an Australian company called ""Digital Versatile Disc."" It is one of many, fine classic animated stories available from the same source. My wife and I purchased a copy at the local Dollar Tree store for $1.00 +sales tax. Hercules is comically cast as being, understandably, a bit stuck on himself. Great fare for kids and adults alike!"
3,Great but not fabulous,My mom brought me a SEXY bar back from Italy and it was to die for. This one is great but not out of this world.
3,ipod care kit,never got it the guy never email me until i emailed him and he refunded my money not a bad experience but not a good one either
1,how many pointless ipod products ARE there?,"sooo...this is supposed to basically be buffing agents of 3 strengths for your ipod,right?first off,you're going to need more than something liquid to buff hard plastic and metal(duh!)second,all this stuff's doing is temporarily filling in the scratches on your ipod--not getting rid of them;like the dvd/cd scratch repair kits.your scratches would turn up again after a few days/weeks of wear i assume.i've worked buffing cars@an autobody place,and i can honestly say that paint CAN be quite easily buffed by hand,but hand-polishing scratches from hard plastic/metal is a joke."
1,Disappointed,I had to return this product twice because during shipping the product had opened somehow and spilled all over the contents in the box. I will still order from amazon just not this product.
2,Monster Blood II,"Not a bad sequel to the inital Monster Blood that I loved. Stine gave a few surprises, but basically it's a threadbare rehash, if you know what I mean. Monster Blood III is slightly better."
2,"It was a good try, Mr. Stine","A scary book? SAY WHAT? A little summary for you lucky young whipper snappers who didn't read this book: A young jack-ass named Evan gives a green glop of stuff called monster blood to his classroom pet hamster named Cuddles. Cuddles grows a hell of a lot bigger and goes on a rampage, killing off everything the hamster sees. Well, the book didn't quite happen like that. I'm sorry, you action adventure fans, no tranquilizer guns, no 10-gauges, no 9 mm. handguns, no chinese rocket-powered hand grenades, no blood, no gore, just a little bit of stupidity."
5,Read this book,I like all the monster blood series and this one is no exeption.In this one Evan is suffering in school than Andy shows up with a little suprise thats back and meaner than before!
5,This is one of the best goosebumps I've read so far,I think this book is exciting books I've read so far. This book is also very good and a little funny.
1,Opinion,"The team arrived poorly packaged. When connected to power to charge for 10 hours and try manual says, it will not start. When connected to power, it lights a red light bulb fades gradually until it disappears"
1,WONT WORK IN A 2004 FORD FOCUS,"This item does not work in a 2004 Ford Focus, the size is diferent, the material is a crapy material, it broke when at the first start of the car.Conslusion: DONT BUY THIS CRAPY ITEM, ITS A WASTE OF MONEY"
2,2/3rd's disappointed,"The first cd is Beegie Adair's Sinatra disc, the other two by Huntsinger are pretty lame in comparison, but for the money its a decent deal for all three."
3,Lesser known disco album,"They Said It couldn't Be Done was the main dance floor hit off this one, but I personally preferred Our Love because it had the upbeat Philly sound I really liked back then, which the best soul dance groups were all about at the roots of disco music. Now for Mighty Clouds Of Joy LP."
4,Nice garment but overpriced.,"These are really nice flannel pants. Fairly thick and very soft. However, even on sale I found Amazon's price of $17 pretty steep. I got mine at a local closeout store (Ocean State Job Lot) for $7.00.I gave it four stars because the fabric they use is not yarn dyed, meaning the print is only on the outside of the garment. The inside is basically white. It gives the garment an inexpensive look and I would have expected better from a company like Nautica - especially for the price."
2,suite et fin,"Si vous aimez HanaYori Dango, ne regardez pas ce film très mauvais, cependant si vous voulez rigoler devant ses outrances, allez-y ! Cependant beaucoup de bonus très intéressants, en particulier des interviews de Oguri Shun et Matsumoto Jun."
2,I've experienced poor results over time,These seem to work when new but after a year or so they seem to run the battery down all by their self. Internal losses seem to go up as they age. I replaced one a couple of years ago because it was running the battery down in a Miata. Now the one I replaced it with is doing the same thing. It will drain a new battery in 3 weeks. I would not recommend one for any vehicle that is not driven every day. Too bad as it is a great idea.
2,Needs maintenance every 3 Months.,"I purchased a Priority start in May 2008. The first unit I received wasdefective. (The unit arrived with the circuit open, red LED on, and wouldn't close the circuit after I installed it.) I returned it and received a working unit.Although this unit works, it has a flaw. Last November (2009) there was such a build up of black crud on the priority start terminal that the car wouldn'tstart. I cleaned the crud off using a wire brush battery terminal cleaner.Now it's January 30, 2010 and I have the same problem. I'm not going to enjoycleaning off the battery terminal in 14 degree weather.If anyone has any ideas as to how to stop the crud formation please let me know."
1,Does not work.,"My 2000 Miata has a short somewhere in the electrical system. This drains my new battery fairy quickly. I was hoping Priority Start would let me get through the winter so I could find the problem during warmer weather. The unit did not work. It allowed my battery to drain completely.I am sure I installed it correctly, following manufacturers instructions carefully."
2,Priority Start,"I ordered 2 Priority Start units. I put one on my Porsche that I store during the winter here in the mountains of Colorado. I expected it to start in the spring when I was ready to drive it again but it was totally dead. I had to jump it and I think that ""fried"" the unit. There were no warnings about that in the instructions. I'm disappointed. The other one is on my Land Rover that I drive year round. If I don't drive it for a few days, the clock or something activates it, and operates as described but I have to reset the radio code every time it disconnects the battery. I wouldn't count on it for any extended storage."
4,Great product,"have not used it much but am happy so far. Heavy in weight, looks solid and sturdy and works great."
4,Did the Job,"I bought this hammer drill to rot out a huge tree stump. In three hours I drilled 120 7/8"" holes 8-10 inches deep in the stump using a spade bit. I drilled for a quarter hour and let the drill cool for a quarter hour. It did get hot and might burn out if used continuously. It was incredibly fast compared to a conventional drill. I've got a couple of stumps to go and I am glad I have it. My only complaint is that I haven't figured out how to attach the chuck key to the drill. If I don't, I'll probably lose it. The attachment strap mechanism isn't obvious."
1,Get a Hilti instead,"Drill burned up going through 4"" garage slab. Grease blew out of bearings... not up to the job. If your task involves heavy-duty concrete or masonry, look elsewhere."
5,"Great Price, Great Product","Lowes had a DeWalt hammerdrill for 79.99 but it was not this powerful. It was an older model, but this price for the 7.8 amp is a good deal (79.99+free shipping +no taxes) I am in love with amazon. I looked around for a while before getting this one and the dewalt name, warranty, and amazon service added up to be a great deal.I like to shop at lowes for tools but I will always check this site to see the price as well.This drill is a monster, it will bore through just about anything. It is more than enough drill for just about any application you could come up with."
2,Disappointed,"The chuck is imprecise causing drill bits to wobble. With a 6"" bit the wobble at the tip is approximately 1/4"". This is a common problem with cheap-o, knockoff drills but one doesn't expect it from a Dewalt!"
5,easy,It is a very powerful but easy to handle tool. Cut through concrete like a hot knife through butter.. glad to have it. Make my work so much easier...
4,Well built,"I like the quality and weight of this drill. It yields ease of use, and power. If you are not careful while using a spade bit or a hole saw, you could break your wrist. Plenty of power and speed for drilling. I would not recommend mixing with this drill since the motor is smaller than would be ideal for mixing. For drilling and driving, this tool does the job well!"
5,Good job Dewalt!,"I bought this for $50 bucks refurbished, just thinking it would last one project(cheaper then renting). I have had this drill for 3 years now. I use it all the time and it is still going strong!Good job Dewalt!"
2,Broken at 18 months,"I have had mine less than two years. It worked okay but it just broke. It runs but the chuck does not engage. I opened it up and gears are stripped. No receipt, no warranty help from dewalt. I will not buy dewalt again."
5,Menopause,"This cd is awsome. You will laugh at the way the words were changed to fit the theme. I did have the pleasure to see the play it was even better. Please if you have the chance see the play and buy the music. Do so!! If you are a female it's doomed to happened to you one symptom or another sooner or later. With the way things are today I look for ever chance to have good clean fun. This is one of them, I would love for them to put the play on dvd. I'll be first in line to buy one."
2,mehh..,"Disappointed with this. I thought I was getting a dvd, not cd. Songs are nothing special really. Too bad, I had high hopes."
3,Good and bad,"Silver Birch, Blood Moon mixes good re-tellings with horrible ones. It has stories that are funny, evil, good, terrible, brand new, re-told, and many others. I don't feel like I wasted my time reading it but there are better out there. I guess it is the same with all mixed books. I enjoyed a lot of the stories, despised about as many. I loved the re-telling of The Little Mermaid in The Sea Hag, but didn't aprove of The Glass Cofin which was just depressing. It was a good book and was enjoyable. I recomend it."
2,"A sad, sad thing","Somebody made a grave mistake! I was surprised by the lack of good stories in this one as compared to the other dark fairy-tale collections by these editors, all of which were endlessly satisfying to me. This book I bought on a whim before I had read it....what a waste of money! Terribly dissapointing, although there are decent parts in the book, hidden in a nook or cranny if you look enough. Save yourself the money and rent this from the library if you don't believe me...maybe you'll end up agreeing with me."
4,Quality Wooden Dollhouse,This dollhouse is built to withstand the abuse of the most rambunctious of toddlers. Solid wood contruction and masterly crafted. The only negative would be the ceiling height between each floor. (A little lower in height than other houses preventing access of larger doll families.) It is still one of the best on the market and a great value when compared to other wooden and plastic houses in the same price range. A wonderful toy that will last a lifetime.
5,Beats foam noodles,"Compared to those cheaper giant foam noodles this product:1. Is just as durable - after a year of use by three kids there is no sign of wear.2. Is easier for small hands to grip - bar is thinner and coated in a spongy rubber.3. Provides better support. Its stiffness means you either submerge all of it or none of it. On the other hand, a large portion of those foam noodles is always under water.4. Is easier to handle in the water - My kids often swim with it off to side holding it with only one hand. Again, you can't do this with foam noodles because of their lack of stiffness.5. Is more portable due to it's smaller size.My three, four, and five year old kids loved it - wouldn't jump off the swim platform without it."
5,Good and complete content covering all the bases,"Covered everything and had exercise diagrams I could follow at home without much trouble. At my level of golf and fitness, this was a well balanced approach covering most of my questions."
3,Fairly obvious,"I read the Golf Digest review and decided to purchase this book. Nothing very surprising, just excercise coupled with good nutrition. Unless you know absolutely nothing about excercise this book is not worth the bucks. If you want to strengthen your swing you might try improving your technique. You might try some other bestsellers like SWING LIKE A PRO, THE GOLF SWING, FIVE FUNDAMENTALS and POWER GOLF FOR WOMEN. As for fitness just keep in shape. For now that's all from the Doc, see you on the back nine....bye!"
5,The complete golf fitness guide,"After 2 months of using this golf training program, the results are great: 10 yards more per club and my handicap has dropped by 3 strokes. I liked the fact that I didn't have to read the whole book to get right to the application. Very scientific as well, my Doctor was impressed!"
2,One beautiful melody,"I was a little dissappointed concerning the rest of the album. I thought it would contain more of the kind like the melody of ""Chasing The Sun"".The only other peace I liked was ""Tunnels"". Since I love Chello music I was hoping to get more of it.I love Ilona Zecacks (Violin"
5,Greate memory!,"It also brings some funny lights over them. At the begging I thought that they were like for telling the capacity o something like that, but it seems that are only for look. Great Performace very fast. So Happy with them."
4,Dreamy.......,I can not believe how relaxing this cd is. I downloaded it on my IPOD and fall asleep to it. While driving the back roads of New England this is so enjoyable to listen too.
5,Judith Martin is as funny and as smart as ever!,"I love all of Judith Martin's books and this is no exception. She conveys the essence of ettiquette in every answer - so even if you don't have that specific problem, you gain a sense of what correct and whats not - and why! And she does so with wit and style. Full of useful information that wedding planners don't always convey."
2,Disappointing; not at all comprehensive,"I love Miss Manners but I was very disappointed by this book -- she's as funny as always but it's not terribly useful for planning a wedding unless you happen to have one of the specific questions asked in the book. It's not at all comprehensive, and many of the questions -- while hilarious -- don't seem like they would come up very often. Not a nuts-and-bolts basic etiquette book"
1,Not my purpose,"A book used by fundamentalists and evangelists to flaunt their beliefs? Ugh, pass the peptio-bismo. Sorry, not what I'm interested in reading. Those who think the book is great and hate the negative reviews, it's life, people can think differently on things. I think this book isn't great. I don't like it. If that bothers you, DEAL WITH IT!"
1,Waste of time - Waste of Money,This is dribble off the mouths of those who have seen there own lives go to ruin.
5,Participating in your purpose driven life,"God helps those who help themselves, so I recommend this book and another book called Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self so that you can be your best and make the most of what is within your control and leave the rest to god."
2,Lacking truth,"I was really excited as I skimmed this book. It seemed to have some good principles. Then as I read more closely, I found it does not follow the Lord's Word. If you feel that the King James Translation of the Bible is the closest we have to the original word of the Lord translated to English, then this book is not for you.As I read and compared the King James text to the translations used by Mr. Warren, I saw how much he has distorted the Lord's Word.I will say though, his assertion that without knowing God and His Spirit, it is virtually impossible to understand our purpose on this Earthly journey."
1,CROCK OF SHIT,If you believe in this crap...I want to sell you a slice of cheese from the moon....Santa is a personal friend of mine........
5,A LIFE-CHANGING BOOK ABOUT LIFE'S PURPOSE,"Pastor Rick speaks as to who we are, what we are, why we are here and our life's purpose for being here on earth. This is the most important book I own after the Bible. Thank you for your love and dedication Pastor Rick. (jmg, OC CA)""Make the change you want to see in the world."" MK Ghandi"
2,Disappointed,"I was pretty disappointed by this book. It seemed to have little substance, which bothered me a lot since it was highly hyped by my church as part of a 40 days of purpose campaign. It also offered me nothing in terms of my own individual purpose in life.If you want to learn about your UNIQUE purpose in life, I recommend ""Discovering Your Divine Assignment"" by Robbin Chaddok. While she does cover the assignment we all share as Christians - to love God and love others as we love ourselves - she actually helps you find the two words that describe your own unique assignment, and then walks you through how to work out your divine assignment in your life."
3,Starts slow,"I didn't care for the break-down in 40 days. Too many days were just fluff. Could have been a powerful book, but started too slow, ended well."
5,Something for everyone,"This book has a little bit of something for everyone, whether someone just looking into the Christian faith, or looking to hone and refine their relationship with God. Oddly (and thankfully), it's not a self-help book spouting off psychobabble interspersed with Bible verses as so many Christian authors tend to grind out lately. This book sticks almost entirely to Scripture only for the answers to the questions it poses, answering them completely and succinctly.Beware of looking for this book to give purpose to the reader's life. Titles notwithstanding, Warren makes it quite clear in the beginning of the book that only God can do that, not us, and certainly not his book. Most dissatisfied readers I have come across seem to have missed that point.But enough about my word for it. Check it out. It may have something for you, it may have everything for you, but I think anyone wondering these questions of the meaning life will find a piece to chew on for a bit."
1,A real stinker,"I can't believe that again and again Christians can get so easily swept up in hype and trendiness. Every church around me just held their nose and swollowed this stuff.Purpose is so much simplier and does not require book after book being written about it.Did we all forget about the Bible? Last time I checked it was not that hard to understand and it is even written in English!My point is that this is written by a man, and people are just gobbling it up like a Big Mac and french fries.People, you are the victims of a huge media blitz, not true grassroots spread. Kinda like someone following you around asking you to eat a big candy bar, after a while it sounds good and you really do not have any choice."
1,No substitute for good mental health,"If you are suffering from a personal crisis which has affected you emotionally or 'spiritually' seek the help of a qualified mental health professional and skip everything else. Don't prolong your suffering. A friend has been reading this book, watching the author's T.V. programs and wrangling with 'the meaning of life' following a series of personal misfortunes. Unfortunately this has lead to my friend finding fault with the lives of all those nearest and dearest, while fueling my friend's delusions of grandeur and creating more confusion over his 'life's purpose.' My friend is no more happier nor wiser."
1,where is the beef?,"Warren does offer much sound advice in The Purpose Driven Church and The Purpose Driven Life. Commendably, he attempts to support most points with ""nearly a thousand quotations from Scripture"" (Life, p. 325). But the ""scriptures"" he quotes are speculative paraphrases such as The Message (see TBC Q&A Oct. '95) by Eugene H. Peterson (NavPress). The Purpose Driven Life never presents the biblical gospel, which alone saves. Readers are told to ""learn to love and trust God's Son, Jesusthis is a watered down Gospel and surely not the Gospel of our Lord and Savior. Tragically Rick Warren is a graduate of Schuller's Institute and it shows in liberalizing of the Gospel which has become ""another Gospel"""
4,Spiritually uplifting!,"I read this book right after I read book 3 of the Left behind Series and was awed. What a spiritually uplifting book. A whole lot less preachy than I expected, this book made me really evaluate my christian beliefs. What a great book for those who have doubts about their faith."
1,Waste of money and time.,"Readers should consider the author prior to reading this book. Rick Warren is the pastor of one of the largest churches in the United States. Pastor Warren has one focus in every sermon and every event at his church... how much money can you give us? He is far more concerned about having church members turn over their paychecks to the church (and I'm not kidding about that) to build a multi-million dollar church administration building than he is about living a purpose driven life. As a former member I can say that the tax avoiding (he doesn't pay taxes even though he is supposed to) Pastor Warren does not live the life he writes about in his book. He lives in an expensive house, drives very expensive cars and uses each sermon to beg for more money. Don't waste your time on anything he produces."
1,...What Would Jesus Say?,"This book is a product of our overly secular, culturally accomodated, highly materialisitc consumer mega-church movement in America.Business professionals will like it and those who do not believe that Gospel actually confronts the American Dream will like it, but it does not get at the narrative that unfolds in the Gospels. As a result it misses the mark by a long-shot.Jesus did not make the gospel easy to hear. Perhaps we have neutered the gospel in our attempts to market it and sell it?This is gospel-lite at its best, which is really no gospel. You are better off reading the actually canonical gospels and start asking questions about what is going on in God's world and where is God's reign and rule breaking in."
2,Rejoice! There is no purpose in life,"This entire book is maddness and I read it clinching my teeth all the way.I guess I have to admit that I'm not a xtian by a long shot and the idea of there being some innate purpose to the chaos of life goes against the grain of the entorpic forces within me.That said it does create a good argument for there being some purpose in life (an argument with which I don't agree).A better recommendation? Pick of Nietzsche and read it or maybe ""Power Persuasion"" by Kaus and Barron. As you sit back look at how we battle the natural forces of entropy by deluding ourselves at the vision of a ""great design"" take heart in that the only purpose in life is the one you create for it.You have a choise.This book will appeal to many people, Nietzschians, nihilists and Discordians not being amoung them."
5,Life Changing,I read the original Purpose Driven Life and it drew me closer to God and led me to find my purpose. Now that my purpose has changed this new revised version came out and it is helping me al over again.
5,The title is appropriate,"The good: Helps Christians find their purpose. Helps them to contemplate their motives and priorities, and get out of the selfish ruts we're all stuck in.The bad: Tries to systemize, number and categorize things that are intangible or otherwise unmeasurable matters of the spirit. ""Your life testimony has five parts,"" etc. All I'm saying is that the author was thinking too small in certain sections."
5,Dare to Dream God's Dream for You!,"Pastor Rick Warren has been able to deliver this book on the spiritual quest by restoring hope in the ""big picture"": that God loves us all and has a wonderful plan for our lives. Through the 40 day experience, (and I suggest you buy the companion journal, if you are a journaler!) Warren helps us to rediscover the dreams that God has by getting back on the spiritual journey, to rediscover the ancient truths of the bible but in a modern context.This book comes out of Warren's experience with Saddleback Church, a wonderful place to explore your purpose and worship God, a place that came out of Warren's ""God-sized dream.""I love the way that he writes: a contemporary style, chocked full of stories of affirmation and breakthrough.I hope that you will not just pick up this book, but read it for the next 40 days.I hope that through this spiritual journey that ""The Purpose Driven Life"" will help you to dare to dream God's dream for you again!"
5,The BEST Life realized.,"This book may well change the way you see your life and give you meaning in ways that you've longed for, but did not know how to achieve. You've got a God-sized hole and nothing can fill it, EXCEPT finding meaning through your Maker. God is ready and waiting to introduce you to a life changing relationship with His Son.Learn how to dream the dream God has for you. You WILL NOT REGRET IT!!! Oh, how I wish I had read this at 16 years of age."
4,Simplify,"""The Purpose Driven Life"" is designed to be read one chapter a day, but don't worry the chapters are very short and easy to read. Warren basically breaks things down and says, Look, this is what is important in life and that is what we are hear for. In a fast paced and constantly changing world of me, me, me, megalomania, commercialism, and the all important bottom line, this book will allow to break down your day and help you to get through, especially in the tight and stressful times. I was happy with my life and content with what was going on in it. I don't go to church regularly, hardly at all in fact, but I do pray every night. This book helped me improve my spiratuallity and relationship with God."
4,Not for everyone but Still A good book,I'm not a baptist like the author but I still enjoyed this book. Eric Brunsvold. Keep your bible nearby so you can reference all the footnotes.Eric Brunsvold
4,spontaneous fulfillment,"This is a powerful book that forces you to ask yourself some defining questions. I think read alongside Dr. Deepak Chopra's new book Spontaneous Fulfillment of Desire, one's life can change profoundly -- or at least your perception will shift."
3,It's ok,"How much money has this guy made on this book and what has he done with it?The book has some good stuff in it, but you can find the SAME THING in the Bible and I can get that for free.I guess I have trouble with a guy whose the head of such a HUGE church, and we know it's HUGE and multi-million dollar huge telling me how to get to Heaven."
1,Preaching and Not Living in Truth,"This book is scary. It preaches, judges and steers people away from their own connection to God. What's more is that it contributes more to the fear people have if they don't follow.If you want a couple of books that will help you get more connected to God try Conversations with God by Neale Donald Walsh, and If God Was Like Man by Barbara Rose. There's a lot of spiritual information, and connection to God without the fear."
4,Great to see an Evangelical book doing so well,"While I might have nuanced theological differences with some of the things that Rick Warren says in this book, it is great all the same to see an Evangelical Christians doing so well - and No.1 on the religious books list, as opposed to so much rubbish. If Christians authors such as Carolyn James like Rick Warren, then he is someone with whom to be reckoned. Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE and WHOSE SIDE IS GOD ON."
1,Read the Bible,"Read the source, read the Bible. God holds us each responsible for what we do and believe. Don't trust someone else to explain it to you. Warren twists it to his own opinion."
2,"A, B, C ... 1,2,3 ... stuff ...","This book falls squarely into the 'a,b,c or 1,2,3 steps to whatever' category that seems to have invaded evangelical christianity for decades. No wonder outsiders see evangelicals as stupid - the material is always narrowed down to three easy steps ... in this case five easy steps to a purpose driven life. You can't do that - life is too complex.Jesus never taught like that ... his teaching was always probing the heart, searching deep within us and allowing us to eventually see the mistakes and, allowing each human being the time it took to correct them.The reason this book has sold so well is that churches are 'doing this' en masse. They buy them by the hundreds, even thousands ... wow. To his credit, Rick Warren has donated theprofits to charity - the decent thing to do.The five points themselves ? ... not bad, but certainly no guide to life."
3,I thought it'd be good,"I thought that this book would be good. Afterall almost all the churches in town are doing a ""Purpose-Driven Life"" seminar and books are flying off the shelf so it has to be good right? Wrong. I couldn't get into it. I am an avid reader, I read two to three books per week. I know a good book. This was not one of them. It is so dry and motionless. It stirs nothing inside. I am a Christian and I love a book that can help me and make me change, but this just wasn't one of them."
2,Overated......really......think about it,"The book started out pretty good, then along the second half of the 40 days seems the author was running out of ideas and begin to repeat himself. Then what really turned me off was when he placed christians into the ""world class"" vs the ""worldly"" catagory. I do believe that no human can make this classification...only god can. Good book overall but way way overrated. Sorry."
2,Trying to attain a level of baby food!,"This book might be mistaken as a Christian book that would help you grow in Christ, but I doubt it. If you are interested in becoming mature in the faith, try reading: This Church is not Appearing Glorious & it doesn't seem to be Purpose Driven, by Meyers, or Holiness Truth and the Presence of God, by Frangipane, or Why Revival Tarries, by Ravenhill. These are landmarks. Save the Purpose driven series for you bird cage. God is serious, and He has higher expectations of us."
3,Start on page 256...,"I'm the author of Lipstick Ghetto: The Girls' Guide to Escaping The 9-to-5 Rat Race. My sister gave me this book a few weeks ago. If you want to learn more about how to use your gifts in ministry start on page 256. Here Pastor Warren talks about how to determine your Spiritual Gifts, Heart, Abilities, Personalities and Experience. He also advises that you listen for ""inner promptings"" from God to give you direction."
5,A Purpose Driven Life,"I bought this book for a friend who is going through a very hard time and he is really enjoying it. I haven't read it but I have seen Rick Warren, the author, on TV and I know that he is very religious and inspriational."
1,purpose driven life,"I am sorry, I bought this book and it was never delivered to the recipient. can someone explain!"
5,A great book to start the new year!,"This is a great book to start off the new year with. If you are looking for more purpose in your life, these 42 daily ""lessons"" are perfect for you. Each day you have a portion to read, a think about it section, and my favorite, access to daily audio lessons. Rick Warren gets you thinking and putting things into action to make your life have purpose."
1,Saddleback: The Money Driven Church,"As a longtime member of Saddleback Church, I must speak out. Saddleback Church had the potential to do GREAT things to honor God's word. As a member, I also met many, many wonderful people who were not your ""Sunday morning Christians."" While Rick Warren's message is usually enlightening, it seldom scratches the surface and is intended to transfer the ""good-all-over"" feeling to attendees - just like his book, ""Purpose Driven Life."" Unfortunately, the buck stops there (in the most literal sense). Rick Warren's church is designed for one thing and one thing only - to make a buck. (Remember, I'm saying this as a member....well, former member who attended Saddleback for many, many years.)Read this poorly written book with caution."
1,"Modernistic, New-Agey claptrap","Okay, in all honesty, there are a few good points made, but too many important facts are missing, and Pastor Warren seems to utilize some questionable methods. First, there is really NO real covering of the issue of ""How to Get Saved""-without that first being established, the rest is useless self-righteousness, which are as filthy rags in the eyes of God. Also, in Chapter 11, it is suggested to use ""breath prayers"", short words or phrases, repeated over and over again, to ""practice the presence of God"". That's identical to the vain repitions used by various eastern cults when in meditation, and very similar to the positive affirmations used in pop-psycology and the New Age. Then, there is the issue of accepting worldliness and disposing of biblical, Christian separation from apostates, along with more, ad nauseum, all adds up to a pretty poor excuse for a Christian book. I recommend trying some good ""Sword of the Lord"" literature, instead. Or just, uh, the Bible?"
1,Run don't walk,"Any ""pastor"" who would use the Message as a ""bible"" should be carefully examined in the first place. Warren's teachings are pure humanism. ""Say aren't you great? I know I am.""Sin? Repentance? Why would I bring that up in a sermon? My marketing staff tells me that makes people go away and not come back!"
5,Awsome Book,This is a great book. A must read for everyone. This book sat on my boodshelf for a couple years. I received it as a gift and I never read it until now. I bought the spanish version for my husband and him & I are reading it together. We love it! What an eye opener! I purchased two more copies for my best friend & her son & now they are both reading it together. It makes you think.
5,WORTH READING AND STUDYING,"WE DID THIS BOOK IN A WEEKLY SESSION WITH OUR SMALL GROUP AT CHURCH. IT IS WORTH READING AND STUDYING WITH YOUR BIBLE IN HAND, ALONE, WITH YOUR SIGNIFICANT OTHER, OR IN A SMALL GROUP.TAKE IT SLOWLY AND PONDER!"
5,good,It arrived on time and in good condistion. It was a good price for the book. I will shop ther again.
3,Worth it?,"I believe Rick Warren is a good honest man but judging from what I've heard about the book, both its negatives and its positives, I don't think any church should do a serious study of this book. I think pastors should stick to teaching the infallible Word of God, only.No doubt, its had a very positive effect on many Christians but I have taken a look at the book and it is very soft, it does not potray the hard truth, especially with its uses of the most idiomatic translations in existance. Im saddened that my church is going to embark on a study of this book, I'd rather litsen to a sermon on the purpose of life straight from the Word of God, which is to ""press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus."" (Phil. 3:14)God bless, Marc (14 years old)"
4,THIS BOOK A REFLECTION OF FAITH,"You get out of it what you put into it. I read this book as part of a small group and got a lot out of it. I was struggling in my faith at the time and thought this book was a little light and ""cliche"" at first. By about the 8th day in the book, I was forced to take an honest reflective look at myself and my claim of Faith. I would whole-heartedly recommend this book to all! It is a great 40 day journey, transforming ""bumper sticker"" Faith into a passion filled walk with Christ.I challenge you to read this book with a open heart and mind, and see if God doesn't ignite the fire for His Holy Spirit in you. I also urge you to continue after the 40 days on your journey to live the Christian life, a life that gives honor and praise to God in all you do."
2,Christians need to be Christ centered not church centered.,"I agree with the author that our purpose is in God and when we find Christ we find our purpose. However, in later chapters the author turns our attention to the importance of finding our place in and upholding 'the church'. This directs the attention to an institution and away from Jesus, some say it is the same thing but I beg to differ. (No doubt pastors love this book because it secures their positions more firmly but many pastors should not be elevated.) Teach Christians to follow Christ - not men."
1,Stupid book,Seems a manipulative effort for a very surface study. NOT a thinking person's book. Can't imagine why it sold so well!
1,False teachings,"Stay clear of the false teachings of this book. If your church wants to have a Bible study with this book, its time to leave your church and find one with more wisdom and discernment. This book mixesthe Bible with New Age thinking and says nothing about REPENTANCE! How can you share the Gospel with out that simple little yet IMPORTANT word in the New Testament?"
1,False Apostles,"The unholy power of the one-minute manager repackaged into a seeker-sensitive, market-driven, ego-centric, swiss-cheese gospel message. 2 Corinthians 11:13 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ."
1,A sure way to increase sin,"Wow. This is bad. This book is extremely legalistic and will only strengthen sin in a person's life (2 Cor 15:56). It makes people feel good about themselves b/c it plays to our sense of self-effort and self-righteousness. It has the appearance of working for a time but is incapable of producing the power of God that permanently changes a person. At best, the reader will read this, try it, exhaust it, come to the end of themselves and give up. Then God can get involved."
1,Read THE REASON-DRIVEN LIFE instead,Try reading Robert M. Price's REASON-DRIVEN LIFE (a five-star book) and get on the reality bandwagon.
2,Disappointing Pablum,"I am a Christian and had high hopes when I purchased this book, but have been quite disappointed. I was hoping for more insightful and inspired discussion about the ways Christ's teachings can change our lives. What we get is simplistic and superficial. The underlying logic is often contradictory. Also, it seems that every other paragraph has a sentence that starts ""The Bible says....."". Then these biblical passages are ruined by the use of a variety of new age tranlations that try oh-so-hard to sound ""hip"" and relevant to our times. And the author even admits he takes artistic liberty with THESE translations to get his point across. No substance. Son of Oprah. Then the last part of the book is him trying to sell you stuff. I'm all for wanting to see Christian books succeed, but if a non-Christian would pick up this book out of curiosity, he would walk away thinking ""they're non-thinking lemmings""."
2,lack of holy spirit makes me queasy,The lack of reference to actual Scripture and the lack of reference to the Holy SPirit makes me queasy. This book is indeed a fad.
1,Not Impressed,"I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend. I was pretty excited to read it after reading the introduction, and even the first day. But as my 40 days wore on, i got tired of the way Rick Warren repeats himself, refers constantly to his church (Because they do everything RIGHT, obviously) and the way he is always plugging his other products (the Purpose Driven Life Journal, The Purpose Driven Church, etc.)Soon after i started reading the book, my church started doing the 40 days of purpose campaign... complete with videos featuring Rick Warren himself who actually prays on the videos.Overall, I really didn't like the book. I got a little bit out of it, but not really anything new that i couldn't have gotten straight from the Bible itself... and by that I mean a TRANSLATION of the Bible, not a Paraphrase (the message) which Rick Warren is SO fond of using."
5,God is calling to His people,I believe the LORD THY GOD is saying wake up my people. For there has been to much sin in the camp and not dealing with it the way the LORD want us to do.Arise to the truth don't keep yuor head in the sand. For the LORD IS COMING SOON. ARISE WAKE UP FOR THE LORD THY GOD IS CALLING HIS PEOPLE TO HOLINESS.
3,Searching,I liked the book but it was repetitive in a lot of ways. I guess we are all searching for an answer that will not be given until we are gone.
1,just a personal attitude book,"I have to say, sometime I am quite uncomfortable when I read this book. Partially agree with some parts but quite disagree with other parts. read bible more than three times, you will understand which part comes from his own idea and which part comes from the Bible.Why we must follow some ""rules"" to follow Jesus, yes, you are living for the Lord, not for others."
2,Troubled From Day One,"I was so excited to begin this book with my church family. Unfortunately I found myself troubled from day one. The purposes in this book are scriptural, but the author quotes ""the Bible says"" countless times with so called paraphrase translations that are inaccurate at best. If you do read this book have a reliable translation and check the quotes yourself. (NASB, NIV, NKJV or KJV) The Bible does say, ""Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handing the work of truth."" 2 Timothy 2:15 NASB"
2,Taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ,"As an honest critique, I found this book to be lacking and shallow. Warren quotes several hundred Bible verses (either in the neighborhood of 400 or 700, I forget) and provides little to NO exposition or exegesis.Christians should honestly review the nature of what Warren is trying to do by offering this Jack van Impe style of rapid fire scripture quotation. Hopefully many readers will be inspired to use this only as a supplement for reading and studying to see if the scripture Warren uses are hermeneutically sound, but they probably won't, as I'm sure many of the quotations are used as blind support verses, as opposed to true exegetical argumentation.All in all, I'm sure the Lord will use this book to bring hundreds if not thousands of believers and nonbelievers closer to himself. But it will happen in spite of this carelessly written book, not because of it."
2,Another formula,"I cannot imagine a book more thoroughly repulsive than one that trivializes the human spirit and something as precious as a relationship to God. This book almost does that but does have some good to it. Basically though, it offers a method, a simple little plan for using God as a means to an end. Spiritually thus reduced is just another bit of gawdy consumerism. This book might be a first step in the right direction, but serious seekers and followers of Jesus will find little here."
5,Very inspirational Bible study,"My church is doing the 6 week study course of ""what on earth am i here for"", which is a guide to reading this book. It has been very inspirational and motivates you to focus on finding God's purpose for your life."
4,Excellent Study for Small Groups,"What a wonderful book! What a wonderful study! To know that I am here for a reason...that God has a purpose for my life...how reassuring and pleasing. Although the concepts laid out are pure and simple, the ""work"" is not simple! God's serious about my life--I must be serious about it too! Excellent small group study."
4,A Purpose ? Yes there is Hope !,"This book gives us hope, by applying these simple chapter by chapter thoughts we have hope for a better world. Hope for people in despair, hope for us all. Even more a sense of purpose for our every day lives"
5,"Thought provoking, challenging, great for group discussions",The Purpose Driven Life is a book that requires two levels of commitment. The first level of commitment is to actually complete the reading. Each chapter is very thorough and it takes a while to go through the whole book. The second level is to follow through on the challenges Rick Warren puts forth and to allow God make changes in your life. I would recommend reading this book as a group. It produces some great discussions.
3,Rick Warren takes a few Theological liberties,"Does God really punish us? I mostly liked the challenges to grow as a Christian. But Rick Warren seems to ignore ""free will"" a few times along with walking a ""tight rope"" on a few other Evangelical Theological issues."
1,Advice for reading PDL,"I would urge those of you who read PDL, to read it alongside a Bible, and to look the scripture references Rick Warren uses. I do realize this is time consuming, as you have to turn to the end notes, find the correct chapter, then the end note number, then the scripture reference (please note which version Warren uses), and then read it in your Bible. This is being a berean (Acts 17:11)."
3,Starts our great but finishes a bit off course,"Rick Warren's book, The Purpose Driven Life certainly starts off great. His explanation of why we are here and how much God loves us is excellent. As he finishes, though, he deteriorates into the guilt based philosophy so prevalent in churches today. You must...., if you do this, God will do that...., get busy. Our Lord is not in the business of bargaining with us. He has ordained the ""work"" we are to do. Walk with Jesus, hear His voice, follow Him. He wants to live His life through us. Look to John Eldredge's series on life - The Sacred Romance, Journey of Desire, Waking the Dead - for a better view on true life in Christ."
1,Huge Disappointment,"This book was a huge disappointment after reading Warren's fantastic ""Purpose Driven Church""This book may be of some use for new Christians, but for most anyone else it's a waste of time, and falls far short of its promise to show life's purpose.The book starts off with some very questionable numerology; and doesn't really improve from there.Warren's exposition is shallow and superficial. Biblical quotes are from paraphrases, and often the book simply mentions ""the Bible says"". Furthermore, there is no justification or explanation as to why the Bible may be an authoritative source.As a Christian this book greatly disappointed me. I don't feel comfortable recommending it to anyone, whether they are Christians or not. In the end, Christians would be better off avoiding this book."
5,Purpose Driven Life Book and CD for Commuters,"Excellent quality on all orders for the Purpose Driven Life. I give these away when I do seminars for my business, Avoiding the Funeral Trap. Delivery was timely even for sources of used books."
1,Not for me,"I tried to read this book...a couple of times. I found it to be boring and simplistic. First it was Experiencing God. That fell by the wayside. Then it was the Prayer of Jabez. Where did that go? This clamoring over this book tells me there are a lot of people with a big spiritual hole. One of the reviewers suggested we check out the Purpose Driven Life Website. So I did. In their store, they don't even sell the Bible. And the tab called The Book...well it's not the Bible. You see more PDL on that site than you do Christ's name. I believe Mr. Warren's intentions are probably good but I would feel a lot better if I saw more pointing to Christ than to PDL."
2,Just a little too much for me,"I am a Catholic, and was recommended this book by a friend of mine who is an evangelical, conservative Christian. I felt it to be a little too much. It was pretty preachy and over the top. I didn't agree with a lot of what Warren said. By the fourth chapter, I just put it down and gave it back to him. I felt it just another way for the bible-belt Christians to sell themselves and to ""save"" people. For super religious Christians, this book might give them something good, but for me, it was talking about a life with a purpose driven to something mine is not."
2,The Purpose Driven Life....,"I got the audio version of this book a couple of years ago, and I have to be honest...it didn't do much for me."
3,"Started reading, but was more driven to In Search of Balance by Dr. Richard A. Swenson","Started reading, but was driven to In Search of Balance by Dr. Richard A. Swenson. Don't know why I switched, but it was the right fit.In Search of Balance should be read by all that are involved in a hetic life balancing faith, home, wife, child, and work. Basically, the life system we live in. This book is faith based on on target with our current times.I'll get back to Purpose Driven Life later."
4,The Purpose Driven Life: What on Earth Am I here For?,"Although there are some things I disagree with in theology, this is a good book that motivates you as you read it. Makes you want to do more in God's kingdom."
5,Great book I am doing it right now with a friend.,I am going thru some difficult times and a friend of mine has suggested we do this book together. We have just started but I feel comfortable with this book.
1,Deceitful,"This book is very deceiving. I would give it a negative number if that were possible. It mixes in scripture and tries to give an explanation of that scripture in a twisted way. Warren may want to do a ""good"" job, but he's going about things in the wrong way. Every church seems to be jumping on this bandwagon and people need to start waking up and realize what's going on. It's NOT Christianity."
1,The Purpose Driven Life,"If you are looking for a decidedly narrow and Christian world view of life, this book will fit your needs. The author raises the bar of sanctimonious living to a new level in presenting this book. A must for anyone wishing simple vilification of an extremely close-minded system; anathema to anyone else."
4,"Simple, Straightforward and an overall good read","Along with J.G. Marking's ""A Voice Is Calling"" and John Ortberg's ""The Life You've Always Wanted,"" I really think Warren's PDL does the best job of better examining the varied aspects of discipleship without necessarily digging quite as deep as the other two, which can be both a good and bad thing.Even though the book does leave the reader feeling like they want more and some of Warren's writing styles and decisions, like the much discussed Bible Version Extravaganza, I really felt like Warren genuinely cared for the reader and was sincere in helping individuals reach a purposeful existence with God.Yes simplistic and somewhat surface-level, yet also engaging and encouraging. I recommend it."
3,It's All Right,"I personally don't see anything wrong with this book. I just think it was a little overrated.Most of the teachings of this book won't really add much to what you already know if you've read the Bible. I think this book is geared more toward new Christians than anyone else.I agree with the 5 purposes, and I think they're good things to remember. But, as I've said, this book will just re-emphasize what you already know. I would recommend reading it no more than one time.On a side note, I can't imagine being in a church as big as the one this guy pastors. I'm used to seeing around 120 people in attendance at a worship service."
2,Books,"This book is more like a text book and seemed to be difficult for me to follow. It just didn't hold my interest. It is probably a very good book for people who prefer to study the information it contains. The ""Messages To Hear"" at the end of each chapter, that's available on the website, are VERY LENGTHY. I think I was expecting more ""user friendly"" information."
5,THE PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE,I CHOSE THE BOOK BECAUSE I HAD SEEN THE AUTHOR ON FOX BUSINESS NEWS. THE BOOK IS A PRACTICAL APPROACH TO LIVING A MEANINGFUL LIFE AND SHOULD AID IN OBTAINING EVERLASTING LIFE IN HEAVEN AFTER DEATH on this earth.
4,A Gold Mine,"This book isn't another self help book. for those of us who are in christ for awhile now. It can be used as a refresher course or as an inspiration. For the curious at heart and the new believer, it can also be inspiring, yet an insight on what a christain heart should be. I would recomend this read to anyone who wants to walk closer with God and to renew their christain walk."
5,A book with a purpose,"We all read books for different reasons. If you do not want to change to embrace God's purpose for your life forget about reading this book. Many of the bad reviews of this book come with those with a distorted view of God. Bad things DO happen to good people but God's grace is always there wherever we go, even unto death. I see book's message as a way of seeing our personal God-shaped mission: (1) to take God with us; (2) enjoy the journey; and, (3) take as many people as we can with us. This is not a bad deal in spite of all our sins and screw-ups with which we humans are likely to impugn our Creator."
5,Great study book for a group,My husband and I used this book to do an almost year long study with our house church group a few years ago. We did a chapter a week and had discussions and worked through the Points to Ponder and Questions together. Probably time to revisit this book I think! Definitely one you can do over and over again
3,Other people love it,"I must be the only person on the planet who didn't resonate with this author's book. I still enjoyed hearing the author in the audio version, and I satisfied my curiosity about the national hoopla -- but I can't say I was inspired, motivated or entertained. I gave the set away to friends who are in awe of author Rick Warren."
1,Nothing impressive here. What's all the hype about?,"This book is nothing more than a self-help manual adapted to the Christian audience. His use of paraphrase versions of the Bible is annoying beyond words. Also, why do I feel like the book is being used as a catalog for the ""Purpose Driven Life"" merchandise collection? Score one for commercialized, warm and fuzzy pop Christianity. Perhaps Christians and churches will find their ""purpose"" easier if they stop chasing every trendy book and video franchise that comes along."
1,american christianity at its worst,"this book only reinforces and perpetuates western christianity's obsession with self-centered theology. this book should exhort people to ask, ""what is God's purpose"" rather than ""what is God's purpose for me?"" this sort of feel-good, watered down christianity will never raise radical servants set apart for Christ. if i'm wrong (and a part of me hopes i am), then i expect there to be an amazing revival SOON, with people committing to share the gospel to all the nations.if you're really interested in finding God's purose (and how you fit into that plan), i encourage everyone to enroll in a perspectives course near you via http://www.perspectives.orgi apologize if i've caused anyone to stumble. soli dei gloria."
4,Great guidelines but the Bible is the key,"This is a helpful book for both baby and mature Christians alike. The only suggestion that I have with this book is to include more footnotes especially when it refers to scripture. It states the scripture but it generalizes it with the statement 'The bible says'. I understand that, but if the exact scripture was provided then I look back to my Bible for confirmation. Other than that, it's a great book for building your relationship and edifying self in God through Christ."
5,Purpose Driven Life,2nd Beat Book ever written - 1st - Bible - Rick Warren writes in a style that is very easy to read and understand and emphasizes taking your time and reflecting on each chapter for a 40 Day time period. Have read this book several times and always get spomrething new and refreshing from his text every time - Thanks Rick !!!
5,Very inspirational,This book is a must read for everyone! I will begin reading it again and this time take notes and do highlighting!
4,Very helpful book,I found that this book and the journal is very helpful for me to get back on track with my Savior Jesus Christ.
1,Pure Poppycock!,"In the Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart tradition, this book is another attempt at using Christianity to further one's monetary gain and/or pump up one's ego through the ""God Says So, So You'd Better"" school of thinking. It is poorly written and even on many occasions cites Biblical references incorrectly. I read the book thoroughly, looking up every reference in three different versions of the Bible, and Mr. Warren must have sprained his thinking muscles several times with the leaps he took in using the references to back up the ""truths"" in the text. Don't bother with this book -- it's just an attempt to brainwash church-going Christians to do more than they're already doing for their congregations by employing manipulation and guilt."
1,Not for recovering evangelicals,"For those evangelicals and fundamentalists who have found their lives have not become happier in their faith, the book for you is the Reason Driven Life, by Thomas Price. Wise and witty, it will show you how to get beyond a simplistic faith that burdens without healing."
5,"Upon closer look, 5 stars, not 4....Needs more stars!","Initially I was only going to give this 4 stars. But after I read through the whole book at one sitting (couldn't put it down) I decided it was worth five stars. In fact, I think Amazon owes this book five stars, it should be 10 stars at least.The Purpose Driven Life will open your mind and your soul. It will help you find your purpose. And you will design your life as God intended you to.Outstanding book. Amazon, you owe us 5 stars!"
1,"""What on earth?"" is correct","I don't recall anything in the book being ouright heretical. That is about the highest compliment I can pay Mr. Warren's work. The focus of the book, however, is utterly man-centered and anti Gospel.This program could only ""work"" in America. Churches love programs. Completing them makes us feel as if we have accomplished something. They fire people up and allow us to pat one another on the back upon completion. This book and the whole PDL phenom is nothing more than another program that will be long forgotten in no time (I have already seen this in multiple churches).Why can't we stick to a focus on the Bible and the Gospel of Christ?"
1,Lame,"I am a christian and also a scientist. I bought the book and took the class at the same time. I dropped out of the class but read through the book. Very surface, very generalized, very over rated. Very dissappointing. If anyone wants one, they can have mine for free."
1,"Maybe for a Christ, not for me.","According to the book, if you're a Christ, then, Congratulations, you already find your purpose of life. For me, an immigrant who is not a Christ, (along with 2/3 of world populations) it is practically saying that I live a meaningless life until I become a Christ.According the logic of the book, it is GOD who create us so that our purpose of life is to serve GOD. So, logically, I could say, my parent give me life so my life is to serve my parent. That is absolutely not true!I have to say, I don't like it and I found it is a little affending to me. I tried to scan the book to find WHY I have to believe GOD and Bible. Author give me no reason other than the quote from Bible, which tell me I have to believe whatever he said."
