3,An Interesting Ethnography,"Women of Belize is an interesting ethnography about a population that is normally not reported about. The author, Irma McClaurin, attempts to tell the story of three Belize women, each coming from different walks of life. McClaurin tells each womens story from their perspective and captures the lives they live- facing such issues as divorce, relationship with males, ownership of property, marriage, domestic violence, and most importantly how they, as women, factor into each of these issues. McClaurin does a wonderful job of telling the story of these women, yet from an anthropological/social science perspective she does not report on the consistency of her research methodology nor the ethics behind her research (example: how forming bonds with the women may have driven the results). A very interesting book for people interested in the Caribbeans, women's studies, or cultural anthropology."
4,"Great Belizian Women Studies info, sometimes dry","This book describes a case study of three Belizian women as well as women's groups from the early 1990's. All of the women are from Lemongrass, Belize, but each of the women are from a different ethnic group. The author interviews each woman and puts each in an anthropological/women studies context. It's not a page turner, but it's interesting, and most of her conclusions seem valid (though interviewing a few more women would be nice). Also, I'm uncertain how correct it is now that thirty years have past."
1,Learning to weld,"Disappointing for a beginner, not very much ""how to"" and the DVD is presented as an infomercial for a Premier Power Welder, if you plan to buy one then this may be a helpful tool, otherwise don't waste your money."
2,Dissapointing,"The most common SMAW (stick/Arc) welding rods are 6010 and 7018. This video talks about 6013 most of the time. This is more like a selling tool for a Premier Power Welder that bolts on to your vehicle like an alternator rather than a training video for welding. They should've used a basic ""buzz box"" or a Miller bobcat and focused more on welding techniques rather than the versatility of one Premier Power Welder. ... Don't waste your time or your money."
4,BMW E34,"It's the usual quality of a book from Bentley Publishers.In my opinion the only problem of this book, is that don't cover the diesel engine, as it is written on the front, and also don't have the doble-panel sun-roof that come with the Touring car, just have the single-panel sun-roof."
4,Good for crappy mechanic,"I am not pro - just a guy trying to save money and keep a 15 year old car safe and in excellent working comfort for the family. I have so far used the book to diagnose an intermittent electrical issue that led me to finding a faulty brake light switch. Explanations a diagrams were good so that the problem was fixed and no one got hurt.Also, because the book is well written, I actually enjoy time just reading the book for relaxation and expansion of my brain."
4,A word of caution about these reviews,"Be wary of these reviews, as not all of them are about thisbook. Amazon have made a mistake and the reviews shown here have beencombined with the ones for the book 'BMW 5 Series: Service Manual,1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988: 528e, 533i, 535i, 535is'. In the review from Canada, dated Oct 27 1998, Amazon state that it is from the 'Paperback edition'. In fact the book on the 1982-1988 cars concerns the E28 model 5 Series whereas the book on the 1989-1995 cars is about the E34 model 5 Series. They are completely separate books, not just different editions of the same book. END tr[17~"
3,E34 Service Manual,"Pretty good with some repairs, but less than telling on others. Does not cover the M60 engine very well and it need more photos to accurately illustrate proceedures.Erroneous info regarding the thermostat, gasket, and housing re-assembly.No other manual is available so this is the best we have."
2,"Lacks in reliability, Better off sticking with a major brand","I bought this DVD drive 3 monthes ago to use it for watching DVD's as well as using it as a regular CD-Rom drive. Now it ceases to work after running a few minutes. This DVD player lacks reliability. It works nice the first couple monthes of light use, with the ocassional freeze up or glitch, but after a couple monthes the drive becomes very problematic and picky in playing DVD's, and eventually just constantly freezes up your computer, forcing you to reboot over and over again. I highly DO NOT recommend this drive. I most likely will buy a name brand DVD drive next to replace this one, such as a pioneer or Toshiba. Hopefully those will be more reliable."
1,"Terrible, broke down in a couple of months","i bought this in feb and it brokedown in oct, terrible!! not worth the money i spent."
4,History Hidden in a Personal Story,"On the surface, Notes from Exile gives a brief overview of the history of the Acadians of Maritime Canada and the difficulties they faced in trying to strike a neutral balance between France and England, resulting in their removal from Nova Scotia in 1755. But wrapped around this history is Doucet's own story as the child of an Acadian father and an English mother who was caught between their two very different worlds.Doucet is a radio reporter and his sense of narrative is impeccable, but while he makes Notes from Exile an interesting read is the intertwining tales of Doucet's youth, the 1994 Acadian World Congress and the history of the Acadians. As frustrating as it sometimes can be, this blending of tales helps underscore how the events of 1755 remain relevant to Acadians nearly 250 years later."
1,Disappointing and at a high price,"Paid about $420 USD for a lacie drive a little over a year ago. While it was reliable (until about 10 months into ownership) it was fine, then I had recurring problems. I won't be buying another Lacie drive.It's fast, but it failed very early in its life for a 'superior' (read ""expensive"") brand.Drives will fail, it's a fact of life. Might as well buy 2 cheaper drives and backup one to another."
1,Big drive - big troubles,"Had drive for 4mnths and started having issues - overheating, write failures etc. Trying to get Lacie to fix/replace wish me luckavoid this product"
4,Worth the money but has a few flaws.,"Upon installing this drive it did not show up in windows at all and I had to go to lacie's web site to download a driver (none was included in the box).I also occasionally had the drive just stop responding (resulting in data loss from programs attempting to write to it). I had to reboot the drive using the power switch on it in order for it to come back. This has also caused DVD burns to fail midway through. Only after checking their website again did I find that you HAVE to plug the drive directly into the computer. A hub can result in losing the drive in windows.So far, after plugging it directly into the computer, it seems to be working flawlessly."
1,My Last LaCie Drive...Ever,"I recently had a 200GB LaCie Big Disk die at work after relatively light use. Then I remembered that I had a 250 model in the same series die at home about a year ago. The wheels started turning: I had a 500GB LaCie Big Disk at home, seldom used and only as a backup. But recently I had used it as a capture disk for a client video project. Then I remembered to look up the item online to see what others were saying. After reading the previous reviews here, alarm bells went off. I immediately began copying files from the LaCie to an internal drive hours ago. And sure enough, just like another reviewer said: corrupted, unreadable files that could not be copied. Luckily, nothing irreplaceable. But LaCie, your products need work."
2,Volkswagen Blues par Jacques Poulin.,I really liked the new begining of every chapter and how the author put my imagination to work with the chemestry between the characters. I really disliked the ending because it ended too fast without any reasoning. The ending was really stupid. They try to find Th√©o throughout the whole book and at then it just ends stupidly.It wasn't really bad but I would of liked a more complete ending.
3,"Hip, Hip hoor,eh.....","I got this for my bf who is about to get his hip replaced....hes been using it before the surgery because sitting at a right angle now with the bad hip is really painful....he wishes it was a tad higher...and the angle - while logical, does make you push forward so you cant sit on it for very long. So while it does the job, its not very comfortable."
3,Helpful in a limited way,"My partner and I are both on the autistic spectrum, and we've been buying a number of books to help us be aware of the potential pitfalls we may face in our relationship. While ""Asperger Marriage"" is an interesting account of a couple in which one partner is autistic and the other is not, it should not be thought of as the type of ""self-help"" book that my girlfriend and I thought it was. Rather, those in such relationships would do better to regard it as an example of possible difficulties they themselves may be facing in their relationships, not as a source of guidance on how to address and overcome those difficulties. Provided the reader enters into the reading with that in mind, ""Asperger Marriage"" is a worthwhile book for those in similar relationships."
3,Not a self help book,"My step son and husband have just been diagnosed with AS and this book made me thankful that my husband is on the higher functioning end of AS. Not to say that we don't have some of the same problems that the couple in the book have. This is a good book for people just learning of diagnosis to realize that they are not alone. However, if you are looking for a self help book this isn't the book."
4,An Asperger's Marriage,The way the book is written is very helpful. The chapters are short and each chapter gives actual examples of what therapists have found to be true about individuals on the Asperger's spectrum. I especially found it helpful for the NT or individual in a relationship with an Aspie who is not on the Asperger's spectrum. The book gives good suggestions for handling situations.
4,"A good toy, but fragile","This toy is incredibly posable. It has a great sculpt. Some of the joints need to be adjusted when you take it out of the box, and pieces come off a bit too easily sometimes. Fortunately, they're just as easy to put back on. Be careful of this with small children as it does have sharp bits.Ultimately, it's a great toy that you can put in any pose that you want, as long as you're careful with it you'll be fine."
5,Surprisingly Tragic,"I had no idea what to expect from this band when I first purchased their CD from Tower Records. This Finnish band combines soothing female vocals, relaxing rock music, and soul-twisting lyrics that will thrust sadness and pain into your body. This is one of those ""unheard-of"" bands that should have never been passed up."
1,Dysons DO lose suction,"I fell so in love with The Animal I bought three of them four years ago and one canister model (one for every floor of my house and one for my cabin). Yes at first they were amazing. Despite cheap construction and parts that aren't interchangeble I wasn't phased. I have three dogs and more cats than I can count. I am also a germaphobe and can't stand animal hair. I've gone through every vacuum out there and will pay anything for one that will do the job. Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news but these are no different than any other. Dysons DO lose suction. Despite regular maintainence and filter cleanings they ALL stopped working- EVEN THE ONE IN MY CABIN THAT GETS PRACTICALLY NO USE!!! I just replaced them with a $65 Bissell Powerforce from Walmart and my carpets haven't looked this clean in years! Yes, it will eventually lose suction too but I'll be out $65 not $500! Live and learn."
1,Don't do it!,"I've only had this cleaner for a year and have had to replace cyclone 2 times already for severe odor. Any moisture, even just regular humidity that gets sucked into the cyclone ruins it and it has to be replaced. Dyson customer service was not helpful and was very rude, since the cyclone evidently is not covered by warranty. Dyson is not worth the money if you have to replace parts and the machine become unusable after only a year."
3,Issues!!!!!!,"Ok guys I did alot of research on vacuum cleaners, I have a yellow lab and wall to wall carpeting. Needless to say I was looking for something specific. Read alot of reviews on this model Dyson, figured it was just what I was looking for. Expensive, but what the heck if it picks up dog hair I'll be happy. Anyway it does a great job on the dog hair, the only issue I have (if I had known beforehand I wouldn't have bought it) the round filter(u know the one, u only have to remove and wash twice a yr) mine gets clogged and filled with hair everytime I use it the hair that's supposed to go into the canister. And it smells rather disgusting, so after I have taken out the filter and rinsed it out and removed all the hair trapped in it, left it to dry, then use the vacuum it stinks. Maybe mine is a lemon I'm not sure. So guess what I'm back to using my original vacuum my kenmore canister. Bottom line DON'T BUY THIS MODEL.........IT'S TERRIBLE!"
1,run!!!,"if you need assistance (ie, need a part), you will be better served asking your dog for help."
1,NO SHOW PRODUCT,"ORDERED THE VACCUUM ON 2-26-09 SAID IT WOULD COME MARCH 5TH TO 20TH BUT NEVER RECD BY MARCH 27TH 2009. TRIED TO CONTACT SELLER NO RESPONSE,GAVE THREE BUSINESS DAYS. AMAZON CAME THROUGH TO ASSIST LIKE CHAMPS.THANKS AMAZON, LAURA G"
1,Vendor lied and I never got the product!,"Iknow the Dyson is a good machine as I have family who owns them.However, I cannot review MY DYSON because the JERK who took my money over a month ago lied over and over again but never send the product.Now, I am waiting for my money to come back."
2,clogs,"I thought I had found my issue with the hepa filter, but I continued to have problems. I have since taken the entire top canister apart to find a whole lot of carpet shag and pet hair clogging the cyclone chambers. My impression on this vacuum is way lower after the trouble I had taking it apart and cleaning it. I had to buy a bunch of odd ball tools and spent 2 hours removing debris. I now believe this to be a bad design for a vacuum and would not recommend it."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!! POORLY BUILT!!!,"My husband and I own a vet hospital, so suffice it to say we have LOTS of animals in our house (10). We specifically purchased this machine because we have heard so many great reviews on how well this thing sucks.Well, suck it does, in more ways than one!! Yes - it has lots of power & will pull your wisdom teeth out of your head if you get it too close. HOWEVER: we had this for LESS THAN ONE WEEK and used it ONCE and it broke. Got something stuck in the hose, and when I went to empty it the part that I had to take off to empty it wouldn't go back on. I'm usually very good at mechanical things, and played around with it. After 45 minutes of trying to put it back together, one of the pieces then came off and wouldn't go back on. I called Dyson, and they told me that since it was MY fault it broke they wouldn't honor the warranty. It's that kind of customer service that will make sure I NEVER buy a Dyson product again."
1,After 4 years plastic is disintegrating!!,"For $500 plus I expected this vacumn to last more than four years! At year 2 the cannister pull mechanism broke so I taped the cannister closed. Since then every piece of plastic from the on button to the cannister release button to the plastic that holds the hoses together has broken. Dyson's response - so sorry, no longer under warranty. Is it just me or did the original commercials say this product was ""the last vacumn you'll ever buy"". I notice they don't use that line anymore. Yes, Dysons do have great suction power and minimal loss of suction, but I have never had even a cheap vacumn self destruct like my Dyson has!"
2,Not that good...,"I am not at all impressed with this vacuum cleaner. My $100 Dirt Devil actually has as much suction as this Dyson. Way over priced for technology that all manufacturers have now. The Dyson is bulky, heavy and the wand is not user friendly."
5,Dyson DC17 Animal Vacuum,"This vacuum sucks up everything! I can't believe the stuff it picks up. The dog hair disappears finally. It is also easy to push, (even being 8 months pregnant)it glides easy. Love this vacuum, my friends are jealous:)"
4,"Good vacuum, horrible instruction manual","The other reviews pretty much tell you what a great vacuum this is, but the user manual is AWFUL. I spent an hour trying to figure out how to get the handle on, and another 30 trying to figure out how to get it back out to use the attachments. And I have no idea what the attachments are for...there's no mention of them in the manual, and they aren't labeled in the box. The manual consists of drawings of the already intact vacuum cleaner with arrows pointing to it, as if to say ""Yes! There it is! There is the vacuum cleaner!"" I can't believe this company can be on the cutting edge of technology, but they can't find a freelance tech writer to put together a decent manual."
2,Pet owners don't buy if you have a long hair,"They say it's for animals, but make sure you have a short and course haired animal otherwise you are wasting your money. We have an Aussie and within a few minutes of using the exposed belt starts slipping due to the hair wrapped around the motor shaft. Stay away from this unit if you have long haired pets."
1,WORST MONEY EVER SPENT,"Do not waste your money on this vacuum. We bought one based on a friends recommendation. First of all there are so many parts to disassemble and clean it is like a jigsaw puzzle. The motor gave out not long after warranty ran out, we took it to be repaired, we were quoted $200 for repairs or $40 to leave it for parts. We gladly took the $40 to be rid of it. We now have a basic $50 vacuum that has worked great."
2,Animal Turbine Head Attachment doesn't lock into place,"OK, it's a great machine, I'm not going to rave about it beyond that because everyone else has already mentioned all the good stuff.So, my one major annoyance with this purchase is the little ""Animal Turbine Head"" attachment and how it doesn't have an option to lock into place ANYWHERE on the machine: not the hose, and not through the main tube. It'll last less than a few rigorous strokes (and I'll bet this is the only review anywhere on amazon.com where ""a few rigorous strokes"" can't be flagged) before it wobbles right off. To use this attachment, you have to hold the turbine head, well... at the turbine head.How hard could it have been to install a locking mechanism to it? Oh wait, there IS a locking mechanism on the attachment, but it only applies to the Dyson canister vacs. For a machine that cost me $400 (BBuy), I expect it to be perfect."
1,filter has to be changed after only 2 uses - what a pain,"Great vaccuum, BUT I have to change the filter every 2 to 3 uses. The filter gets so full of ""stuff"" the vaccuum doesn't work. Dyson rec: cleaning every 6 months. This is not the case with this model.I rec: looking at other dyson models. I bot this one to replace my aging DC14 Animal (Very good model). That one lasted about 7 years - fairly good for the age of built to obsolete...."
2,Not worth the price,"I replaced a $50 bagless bissell with the Dyson and perhaps had my expectations a little too high. It is definitely a huge improvement over the Bissell (what wouldn't be?), but I still see dog hair left behind. Dyson makes a big deal about its engineering, but it seems like it was designed by an engineer who didn't actually vacuum a house. It is too bulky to get the space beneath the cabinets to the toeboard - you need to stop, get out the wand, and add an attachment. To stretch the long tube for the wand, you have to be very careful or the whole vacuum will fall over. The wand itself is too long, making it difficult to use for things like vacuuming the furniture. I bought a refurbished model and paid about 1/2 the retail price. I would say it is just worth what I paid for it. If I were buying again, I would buy something else. I'm just very glad I didn't pay full retail price."
5,Eye Opener,I just tentatively got the DC17 Animal. I was concerned that it wasn't worth the money. I was wrong. I have now used it all over my house and no other vacuum that I've ever used has picked up more than the Animal. It picks up cat hair easily. I can't believe that I didn't try the Animal earlier. I've been wasting my time with inferior vacuums. Now I see why Dyson has sued company's like Hoover; their technology is patented and superior. Pay the extra money and get a quality product. It's well made and feels very sturdy. The five year warranty is pretty cool too.
5,The BEST Thing to Happen To Cleaning!,"I bought the Dyson DC17 Animal Vaccum 2 weeks ago. I was blown away with how wonderful it is. I have 2 kids, a dog and a cat, and I try to keep the floor clean as much as I can. I vaccumed the day before I got this vaccum and as soon as I got the Dyson home, I vaccumed again. I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW MUCH I GOT OUT OF THE CARPET! I could not believe how dirty the carpet was even though I vaccumed the day before. Vaccuming is my least favorite chore, but I find myself wanting to vaccum now. It comes with amazing attachments and carpet care kit. I would DEFINITELY recommend this product. My carpet has never been cleaner and looked nicer since we had it brand new!"
5,Unbelievably wonderful,"I was a little leary to buy a rebuilt item. I happened to receive the vac the day my cleaning lady was here and used it after she left. I couldn't believe my eyes! We have a golden retriever, that we love dearly, but sheds terribly. I got almost a full cannister full of hair with the Dyson. I would highly recommend this vac to anyone with a dog or cat. It is amazing."
1,BEWARE if you have new carpet,"I recently upgraded my DC14 to a DC17 and had very terrible experience with it. The DC14 was a wonderful vacuum and worked flawlessly for the pass 2-3 years. But after only 1 time of use with DC17 on my less than a year old carpet and it's not some cheap carpet, it totally damaged it. Like other customers complained, it pulled all the fibers from the carpet and now my carpet looks terrible!! I am return this this DC17."
1,Good while it lasted,"It did clean well. But then it broke!!! It has now been broken for three months and I am still waiting for parts. The 'approved' store that I brought it to has TEN Dysons waiting for the brush bar to come in. I am third in line so who knows when I will get it back. Customer Service is not helpful at all, they keep telling be one to two weeks- obviously not the case. I would not recommend this produt if it is going to be your sole vacuum- Have a back up ready."
2,The canister clogs and needs use of hand to empty it.,"I have had DC17 for more than an year. The suction is great but the backside of the canister gets clogged very often. When I try to empty the canister, the dust / debris never drops off, the only way to clean it would be to remove the transparent canister, use the hand to remove. The place becomes a mess as the dust falls off in this process. Really annoying, irritating messy chore. I called up the customer service and they asked me to take the vacuum to the service rep.. which I had to drive for 45 mins. The rep did not give a replacement vacuum and he took more than a two weeks to repair it as he had to wait for a replacement spare. I was very much annoyed because of this.Later I returned the vacuum and got it exchanged hoping that the problem would go away. But the problem has been continuing. I am really disappointed with this vacuum.Giving 2 stars just for the power of suction..."
5,Best Gift I could ever get,"My girlfriend and I both got iPod's and acccessories this holiday season.. we then proceeded to return them so we could get this Dyson instead. It was the best decision we made! The DC17 picked up more dirt and cat hair from our carpets than we ever thought was down there.. and we just vacuumed with our Bissell last week! It is truly a wonder.. finally I can make lines in the carpet when vacuuming, and I love the hose that detaches and you can get in the small crevaces and beneath the couch with the low-reach tool. If you're looking for a vacuum regardless if you have pets or not, this is the one. Well worth the investment!! Especially with their new 5-yr warranty. Go Dyson!"
5,"If you have pets, buy this vacuum.","I purchased my Dyson Animal 2 years ago. Here is the simple truth; we live on a mountain with 4 German Shepards who track minerals from the earth in every day...not to mention,,,dog hair. I use this vacuum EVERY day. It never let's me down and always keeps our beautiful home looking beautiful."
4,I love it!,"I've had mine since January 2007 and love it's performance. I had a dirt devil before this and what I did when I first got it home was vacuum an area in my living room then vacuumed over it with the Dyson. Oh wow! The Dyson picked up so much stuff even though I just vacuumed!So why only 4 stars? Well two reasons.1. I hate the hose. Instead of a ""hose"" you have a handle attached to the hose which makes cleaning up stairs or hand held jobs awkward.2. Don't use this if you have shag carpet. I have a red,throw rug that is shag and it nearly ate it. I noticed it when the canister started becoming red that it was eating my carpet."
5,Perfect,Perfect Vacuum for allergy sufferers. I am still baffled at the dirt this machine can pick up. The roller brush is extremely powerful so I would not recommend using this on shaggy type carpet.The only downside is having to clean off the inside of the dirt chamber when the small holes get clogged. I am allergic to dust mites and this has help me tremendously. I have never owned a vacuum that produces such wonderful exhaust air.
5,Best Vacuum ever,"I have owned the dc-17 for about 4 mons now. By far it was well worth the money, I had contemplated is it worth the almost 600 dollar price tag, and yes it is. I have 2 dogs now, and it picks up all the hair, too much hair, my carpet always looks clean.. My whole house is carpet and i consider if anyone is looking into buying it you wont regret buying it. i had a hoover windtunnel v2 for about 3 years and with less than year of owning it, it would smell herendous, my husbands friend wouldnt want to come over it he knew i vacuumed with it, because it smelled that bad, and i hated buying bags, and the suction was really bad, and i spend 300 dollars on that one, so the dyson with double the cost is the best ever.. i love the easy push of the button, all the dirt comes on out, and the washable filter, AGAIN i love my DYSON!!!"
3,Tough to clear clogs,"Its' suction is comparable to my shop vac but due to right angles at the base of the unit it clogs easily and re-installing the pieces after clearing the clog is fusstrating to say the least. A couple of times I wanted to tale my sledge hammer to it. I can fix almost anything but the engineers were on brake when developed the bottom suct. tubing. I would not purchase another one but give it to the marketing wizards, they could sale a glass of water to a drowning person. Hopefully the newer ones will have a larger diameter piping and less angle degree on the bottom piping. I should of listened to cons. reports instead of my relatives and Mr. Dyson. As I read in another review you are on your own once you have taken it apart to clear an obstruction. In retrospect we do own four labs, maybe it's too much hair for the Dyson to handle. Just remember this is not a shop vac so be cautious when suctioning large debri or dog hair. F. Batch"
3,Broken Belts,"This vacuum does indeed clean well, but we've had two broken belts on it in just a few months. The belt driving the brush roller. I've seen reviews saying ' no belts to break'. I don't know what vacuum they are using, but our Dyson DC17 Animal DOES have belts that can break.Except for that issue, it cleans better than anything else we've ever had"
3,Five stars for suction and one star for durability,"I paid nearly $500 for the ""anamal"" style vacuum about five years ago. The vacuum has tremendous suction and still does. However, the vacuum is falling apart because of the plastic material used in its construction. The vacuum is on its last leg because a handle used to lift the vacuum is cracking and will soon completely break. The price for a replacement part is $75 plus tax and shipping. That is about 20% of the cost of the original vacuum. Meanwhile my thirty year old budget-grade Hoover is still operating and still intact.I have complained to Dyson about this product and they have not responded after nearly two months of waiting.If you can afford the price of a new plastic Dyson every few years and you don't mind being ignored, you will benefit from its superior suction and cleaning ability."
3,Great Suction; Poor Service,"This vacuum rocks for suction power. It takes our dog's black hair off of our light carpets with ease. It is heavy and I cannot get under my sofa, but I have made adjustments.While I think it is a good vaccum, trying to get warranty service for it is awful. I either had to drive it 90 minutes from my house or send it back to Dyson. I opted for the latter. They had it three weeks and offered to provide updates as the repairs went along. However, the SEVEN times I called, they had no idea what was going on with it because their ""systems were down."" I guess face to face interaction doesn't work at Dyson. Anyway, I got it back only to find out that a plastic part that held the extension tube onto the main vacuum was broken. Guess what? I had to return it AGAIN for another THREE weeks!!!I will NOT buy another Dyson because of the service problem. If you feel the same about being inconvenienced when you pay $500 for a vacuum, I suggest you do the same."
1,"great vacuum, stinky smell","I have had the vacuum for 17 months. The suction and cleaning ability are still fantastic. It brings up much more than you can see. The downfall, which is tremendous, is that it after over a year of use the unit smells. Every time I now use the vacuum the exhaust smells and I have to air out the room. I have cleaned the unit often and still cannot get the smell out. I would recommend another unit because of the stench."
2,Fragile,"We've had our DC17 for about a year now. It does a great job on the carpets picking up dog hair. The problem is the belt-driven beater bar. The belt snaps easily and it is nearly impossible to find a replacement. Turns out, Dyson knows of this design flaw and has replaced the brush bar with a new one that takes a wider belt. All well and good except that the part is back-ordered indefinitely.I've owned a Panasonic cannister for 20 years and have replaced the belt once."
1,"I love the vacuum... but, where can you buy a replacement belt?","I love the Dyson animal. But, where in the world, if a beater bar belt breaks, can you ever find a replacement belt.The company doesn't sell them... there are none on the internet. For what should be a top-of-the-line...super customer friendly company.. considering the price of this rolls-royce. you might as well throw it away, if you can't buy a belt.DYSON..if, you're listening...help please..!!!"
3,Best Vac Yet,"I have finally found a vac that's better than my Hoover Elite. The Dyson DC17 is just plain better! The only drawback is the price.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
1,Beware Vacuuming Berber Carpeting,"This vacuum sucked up my high quality Berber carpeting and left a bare spot 8"" X 1"" that I now need to get repaired. And when I called my carpeting store to schedule a repair, they said they had 3 other complaints of the Dyson destroying carpeting. I will be returning it today."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this vacuum because we have a big, hairy, year-round shedding dog. The good points are: it's fairly light-weight; the self-propel feature is great, almost making vacuuming effortless; the long hand-held tube is also nice and reaches all the way to the top of my stairs without having to lug the whole machine. While the Dyson does an awesome job on carpets, it fails to reach the corners or along walls/cabinets. When you have pets, hair tends to settle in these places, and I have to constantly use the hand-held portion to reach these areas. We then adopted a cat. Here's where my frustration comes in: Dyson's POOR performance in picking up cat litter! It merely pushes it around my floor!! I resorted to using my cheap, old Dust Buster for the cat litter! VERY disappointing considering the price of the Dyson Animal."
1,It WILL NOT last,On 4/2006 I bought a Dyson Animal and today 4/18/2009 I had to drop it off to be repaired - the clutch broke and the vacuum can not be used. For a 525.00 vacuum - this is crazy - be aware that although you think you're buying a quality vacuum - you are not. The Dyson's are not built to last. I use (ahem used) mine around 2 times a week and take care of it - clean the filter at least every 2 months. Bottom line... don't buy this vacuum.
1,Consumers Reports is correct,"Consumers Reports is correct, this is a very poor vacuum. We have light wood floors and you can see our dog's hair on the floor after we vacuum. When we called Dyson they told us to use the hose with the floor attachment to clean to floor. We have in/door carpet in the garage to collect up debris before we get in the house and after vacuuming this carpet you can still see grass on the carpet."
3,Seal defect had all cyclones plugged with dirt,If it weren't for the documented defect in the bottom rubber seal on the canister it would be great. But after a year I found myself painstakingly disassembling the canister and pulling 8 cone shaped dirt chunks out of the top of the canister. Many thanks to the internet community for documenting this. Now I have glued the black rubber seal in place and check it before each use to make sure it doesn't move. It has been fine since.
5,More than worth the price,"I mulled over this decision 3 months before I finally bought it. I just couldn't see paying that much for a vacuum. I finally bought it yesterday and can't stop vacuuming. Definitely pricy, but worth every penny. I can feel the house getting cleaner. The carpet looks, feels, and smells different. Much more fluffy. And for someone that HATES vacuuming, having a vacuum that makes you want to clean is priceless."
5,Drywall dust not an issue,"My input is following 3.5 years of service in a pretty strenuous household. I've got 2 dogs and 2 cats which is why I purchased it, and I have no regrets. The latest brag I have on the product is how it handles my clean up of my interior home improvement projects. I recently skim coated my hallway and sanded it smooth. After I picked up the drop cloths, I had deep piles of drywall dust along the edges. This Dyson didn't loose suction during this clean-up which captured about 3 inches of drywall in the canister before I emptied it (3 times). After the project was done, I blew out the hose and vacume chamber with compressed air and the DC17 looks in great shape. If Dyson would make a shop vacume, I would seriously consider buying it."
3,"great vac, but handle is a real pain","This vac is wonderful on wall to wall carpet, but the attachments are NOT. I can't use this on bare floors because the attachment just pushes dust around, but if I didn't use that, the upright vac would blow it everywhere. The hose is so tightly sprung that you will be fighting the base which you will have to drag around at arms length the whole time. The geniuses at Dyson need to figure out how to fix this! Its enough to make a sweet old lady curse like a sailor."
5,Worth every penny!,"My wife and I have a dog that sheds a lot. We decided to get our carpet professionally cleaned a week ago for the holidays. After cleaning our carpet, the cleaner recommended we invest in a quality vacuum, as he picked up a ton of hair. One of the brands he mentioned was Dyson. I did a little research online and was worried at the price (usually around $450 for the DC 17). We ended up finding one for $350 after a rebate and decided to take the leap. I just finished vacuuming our entire house today and filled the entire canister, within seven days of having our carpets cleaned. I was amazed at how much dirt and hair it picked up. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has a dog that sheds. It came with a bunch of attachments that come in handy for furniture and stairs. Buy this vacuum! You won't regret it!"
2,"Problems from the start, unfortunately.","I was really excited to get my new Dyson vacuum cleaner. It worked great the first few times I used it, but then I started to have problems with suction (isn't that what Mr. Dyson swears will never happen, EVER?) I'm a fairly intelligent person, so I knew to check the filter and the canister, and make sure that everything was locked into place. After cleaning everything I could detach thoroughly, it was still not working well, so I brought it to the local Sears repair site. They looked it over and ""fixed"" the problem. I brought it home and tried it out and it worked great...until about a week later, when I had the same suction problem again. I have not been abusing the vacuum; I am very careful with it and have been cleaning and storing it properly, so I'm frustrated that it is not working like it should be. The time has come after four years of using this VERY mediocre vacuum to purchase a new one, and I don't think I will be buying another Dyson."
2,Small,"This is a very tiny grill. It's usable, though. But I wouldn't get it thinking I could feed more than 2 people with it. And you'd better not be starving. The company waited over a month to debit my account which was confusing and caused me to think they double charged me. That was annoying. It's a good quality grill but it's very, very tiny."
1,Rip off Alert,You couldn't BBQ a cockroach on this. I was angry when I saw it. Best use??? Ashtray. The shipping cost as much as the product and would not be refunded if I returned it. It would cost me as much as my refund to mail it back. I threw it in the trash can because it is so useless. I feel ripped off of $37. Shame on House of Rice. The only reason I rated this item with one star is because they wouldn't let me submit it at all with zero.
3,Disappointing,"There are some good tunes on this double CD set, but many are disappointing. Too much jazz and swing sound to some of them to suit my taste. I like the Bill Monroe type of bluegrass, and not just a conglomeration of tunes by people who had one or more bluegrass hits.I got it cheaply enough that I can't complain too much, but it is not what I expected and hoped for."
3,It works,This is a simple extension brush. It seems to work fine. Note that it does not include any kind of soap dispenser.
3,Not great,"It works as a brush pretty well, but as for the ""flow-thru"" feature, it doesn't work very well."
1,Forget It !!!!,"I am an avid vehicle detailer and have always taken the very best care of any vehicle I've owned.This Wash Brush is by far and away the very worst product I have ever used! The handle does not stay on tight to the hose,the extension easily loosens and the brush turn like having a mind of its'own. Don't even think of buying one of these. Its'a waste of money and nothing but a piece of JUNK !!!!"
4,Great for the money,"I've only used the brush standalone, and haven't hooked it up to a hose. I got it to clean the vinyl siding on my house and it works very well. When using the brush with telescoping handle, you do really have to tighten it to keep it from working its way loose. It seems to be very durable so far. I took it to a work day last weekend and some of the teenagers helping out thought it was a push broom, so it spent the day sweeping up dirt and leaves. With a quick rinse, it looked good as new. I was impressed. It's a great buy in my opinion. I give it 4 stars because the rings that clamp the handle in telescoping mode are plastic, not metal."
4,So far so good.,It is very convenient to use. Long enough to cover the whole car body. Will like it more if it is softer.
2,Not too good.,"If you're looking for big gains then look elsewhere.Pros:- 'stylish' for an antenna (some would think)- multiple adapters includedCons:- 4db is not much of a boost compared to other antennas- attached base does not tilt/swivel, so you're stuck with vertical orientation- fixed 2ft cable is too short if you need an extension, but too long if you don'tMight be useful to someone with an under-desk system unit who needs to get the antenna up onto the desktop, but does not work well on either my SMC broadband router or D-Link repeater."
1,FAct or Fiction,"The author of this book is a real life fighter pilot with an official confirmed count of one victory. His supposed exploits indicated in this book are partially real, but are for the most part performed by his squadron mates. For example, the incident of his being captured in Sicily was actally the experience of a Lt. Chapman from the 71st Squadron. Also, the saga of being forced landed in the desert is an embellishment of the experience of Frank Maglio.There has been several investigations into the claims made by the author with only one victory being substantiated. Most notably Hub Zemke and the Americn Fighter Aces Assciation have rejected his claim. Articles in aviation journals and TV have also shown the fiction in this novel. The author should have written about his true experiences which would have been sufficient enough instead adding to them with the claims he makes here.It would better to place this volume as fiction than biography."
4,"smart, gripping, never boring","I knew nothing about flying P-38s until I read this book and never even would have thought it an interesting subject. But Arnold put me in the seat with him as he and his squadron fought World War II while he endured anti-Semitic bigotry in the Air Corps. Lots of things in this book stick with you. Arnold loved and never insulted his beloved P-38, but it was a flying coffin. What a fine look at WW II."
4,Door Knob Five Two,"Four stars limitation due to adult military language making it unsuitable for teens.Yet, a very good read that reveals the real life of a WWII fighter aircraft pilot. The author being that pilot and also of the Jewish faith includes the harsh discrimination imposed by a peer. Great description of combat experiences and emergencies. One would never expect a pilot to develop callouses upon his butt but the writer makes the reader wince as they develop, crack, and bleed. Read it!!"
2,Global Village 56k/v.92 for mac call waiting,Do not buy this modem if you are interested in the modemon hold/call waiting feature.The modem is hardware compatable with this feature but according to Global Villagetech support there is no software available for this feature.So even if you have call waiting and an ISP with v.92 servicethis modem will not enable you to receive calls while online.
3,Metz still doesn't know how to improve the value of this product,"Given the high price of the adapter, Metz should have made it programmable by the end-user. Instead, it can only be re-programmed by the factory technician. In my case, it did not appear to work any better than the earlier version for my Nikon D2X, Metz 76MZ-5. But then, there is no other alternative!"
2,Fumble at the 10 yard line,"This book is mostly a rehash of Gene Fowler's 1950's original writings on Decker and Hollywood buddies. Try buying used copies of Fowler's ""Good Night Sweet Prince"" and ""The Minutes of The Last Meeting."""
2,Connection Issues,"I tried to use this device to hold my MP3 player, the arms on the side prohibited me from hooking up to my external power (Cigarette Lighter adapter) and it spins around like a clock"
3,It kinda works,The telephone holder only works if the telephone is not plugged into the charger. The charger cannot be used because of where it connects to the phone. That spot is covered by the phone holder.
1,You get what you paid for...,"Don't let the price fool you. When I got the ""universal"" mount only one of the arms is retractable so the device isn't even centered on the mount, the adhesive to stick the mount on your dash is a joke and with a device in it, it's too heavy for my vent and bangs around on every turn. Waste of Money..."
2,Not for spraying distance ! ! *DOES NOT* GO 40 FEET,"Does not spray 40ft out. MAX 20 ft. ALTHOUGH, it does create a FOUNTAIN SPRAY ! ! ! ! ! !"
2,Nozzle Review,"This nozzle started out fine, but after about a few weeks of use it's already leaking at front end of the nozzle. Usually, a nozzle leaks at the connection between the hose and the nozzle, but this one leaks after it's been closed completely off. Disappointing."
5,Market Review,This a product that I would highly recommmend.It came at a good price and has great quality.
2,Disappointing,"I liked the idea of a rubber armored nozzle to protect my patio from chips if it is dropped. The performace of this product is well below my ""Home Depot"" old-fashioned standard brass nozzle of similar design. I doubt the bright (aluminum?) metal components in this nozzle will be as durable as brass.There are better products available."
2,Very small,Seems like ok quality but very small. Not full sized like my ole one. Got a better one cheaper at menards after this purchase.
4,"For a change, a REAL alternative to the mainstream!","Tomas and the gang really rocked out on this early release. Personal faves ""Bottom Of The Chain"", ""Roadkill"", ""Mother of Christ"", and ""Roaches in the Sink"" show just how dangerous rock-n-roll could be with the Donut at the helm. Plus, when Donut does a cover tune, they plant tongue firmly in cheek and make it their own. Comical case in point: ""My Boyfriend's Back."" Alice Donut was criminally unrecognized during their day but hopefully keeping their titles in print will keep some of the most sincere alternative rock alive. If you really do want an alternative to the mainstream, the Donut won't disappoint."
1,Seriously Flawed,"I had to read this book in Seminary, and was never much impressed. VL basically assumes feminism is right, and then goes on to argue in a circle. Her ""missionary"" hermeneutic is nothing but the old good Paul (the parts I do like) v. bad Paul (the parts I don't like) tactic that leaves the reader the ability to pick and choose which parts of the Scripture are ""correct."" Once you pick YOUR ""correct"" parts, you use them to correct the other verses you don't care for. Despite the alleged sophistication, this procedure is really quite childish (selfish, idiosyncratic, etc.). We deserve much better than this from Evangelicals."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,NEVER GOT TO SEE THIS ITEM BECAUSE THE GLASS SHELVES WERE BROKEN UPON DELIVERY. CUSTOMER SERVICE GAVE ME THE RUN AROUND WHEN TRYING TO GET A REFUND. I FINALLY HAD TO USE A-Z AMAZON GUARANTEE IN ORDER TO GET MY REFUND. I WENT TO BEST BUY AND PURCHASED A TV STAND SIMILAR IN DESIGN BUT ONE THIRD THE COST. FINALLY AFTER A MONTH OF BACK AND FORTH WITH THIS COMPANY I CAN TRULY SAY I AM SATISFIED
4,Cashel Ankle Safe Experience,"My husband and I have used a Cashel Ankle Safe for over eight years. During this time we have had to replace it twice. We use it while horseback riding on trails anywhere from one to six hours at a time. Mostly it is used to carry emergency contact information, a cell phone, a safety whistle, and a pocket knife.We rely on the Cashel Ankle Safe to keep our stuff attached to us at all times. On solo rides this is a necessity. Several times, my husband has come off his horse, had his horse run away, and needs to call for assistance. Having the cell phone on your person rather than the horse is vital.However the Velcro band does eventually `give out' over time from use (and cold, and rivers, and mud). This is after several years and approximately 1000 hours of operation. The Cashel Ankle Safe is still the best option for our uses."
3,Take into a Bike Shop for a minor tune-up,"It's a very nice bike. It shifts very smoothly, rides well and looks good. I had some reservations about the bike. I didn't like the dirt type tires that came with the bike, I switched to street tires after falling on wet pavement. More importantly, the bike was not set up properly. The wheels were not straight so that the brakes were not well adjusted, making for unsafe stopping. I took the bike to a local bike shop and got a minor tune-up (true the wheels and adjust brakes and shifters). After the tune-up the bike rides great."
1,these are cardboard blocks,these look like fun but they are CARDBOARD you have to fold them together and this is not a durable toy if you have small children that might throw them or step on them
2,inaccurate information,I found that the information about the trip down the east coast of Lake Michigan contained a substantial error. I have a slip in Soutn Haven and have traveled both up and down the coast from there. The distance between Holland and St Joe/ Benton Harbor is closer to 6o miles than the 41 they claimed. Makes me wonder about all the other Information
1,A waste of time,This book is a syrupy romance with nothing surprising in the plot. It'a formulaic and lacks emotion.
1,Customer service is awful!,Product was damaged so I didn't even unpack it. I can't get anyone from Badger Basket Inc to contact me back. The productBadger Basket White Elegance Round Baby Bassinet with White Waffle and Pink Beddinglooks cheap from what i see.
5,Excellent Insight,I am a veteran public high school teacher with National Board Certification. Neil Postman is brilliant. Everyone should read this book.
2,Not horrible but c'mon you can easily do way better,"I don't know anybody who would actually buy this stuff. It doesn't smell bad, but it's not great, or even good. It smells more like an aftershave your barber would give you; overpoweringly musky. You can easily find an excellent cologne for even less than this stuff. The ""Designer Imposters"" label has body sprays and colognes that smell identical to the expensive designer brands and are very affordable."
4,intended for the Newford crowd,"This seventeen-story collection takes Charles de Lint fans back to their favorite urban center Newford where magic is a way of life. Sixteen of the stories have been released in other publications, but not in one book. One tale is brand new. Each story contains an assortment of seeming losers obtaining a new lease on life either by the help of a kindhearted magical being or overcoming a malevolent essence. The stories are well written fantasies, but intended for the Newford crowd. Any other reader should try one of Charles de Lint's novels such as THE ONION GIRL first.Harriet Klausner"
2,"The box is nice, but wasn't what I expected.","I was looking for something that would actually hold cash (bills) and not just change. Unfortunately, the money slots are only coin size, which didn't compute in my brain from the image. The box itself is well made, which is great, because when I tried to contact the seller (Shoplet) to return or exchange the boxes, they were absolutely NOT helpful. The vendor sent me a number and said the UPS would pick up the package. I sent them two emails asking about how that worked since the items were shipped to my home address and I don't usually sit at home waiting for the UPS guy to stop by. I never received a response to my email inquiries, so now I guess I'm stuck with the two boxes I purchased.I usually enjoy buying online, but this was a negative experience and I do not recommend purchasing anything from Shoplet - find another seller!"
1,Do not believe the title.,"You will never learn the material in this book in a day. You might learn the book in 240 hours if you practice 45 minutes a day for about a year. If you really want to learn Spanish, then I would practice for about 2400 hours.I never should have believed the title."
4,Great for the Paranormal,Normal flashlights can be rigged or function in a way that can falsify evidence when investigating the Paranormal. This flashlight will eliminate that problem. Now all I need to do is wait for something Paranormal to happen and cause the two senors to trigger this flashlight into turning on. Let's only hope I live long enough for that to happen. This is a great light weight flashlight. I will warn you not to look into the light as it is bright enough to burn your retinas.
5,Waterfall of Spirit rain,"Kabir once held up a reading to 1500 of his devotees for two days, in order to wait for Mirabai to arrive. That's how important He thought She was.In Kabir's words:You have slept for millions and millions of years. Why not wake up this morning?Thanks to Jane Hirshfield and Robert Bly, for standing in for Mirabai and Kabir.These poems are that good.A waterfall of morning to wash your spirit."
3,Better get the long authentic version of these poems,"Bly and Hirshfield have made well phrased cries of passion out of Mirabai's poems. I recommend A. J. Allston's edition, however, (also available on Amazon) of The Devotional Poems of Mirabai as giving the poems in longer and more authentic form."
5,My kids love these blocks!,"My 3 year-old and my 6 year-old love these blocks. They build castles and then knock them down. The blocks hold up fairly well, you just can't jump up and down on them. We've had ours for almost a year and my kids still play with them all the time."
2,The programmable timer is a joke,"You can only ""program"" the timer to turn the heater on or off in a number of hours. What I'd hoped to get instead was a way to program a day cycle: 4 hours ON in the morning and 4 hours ON in the evening (or something like that). How can you call the timer programmable if it's just a plain timer, with only one time setting?Also, the overheating protection triggers for no reason. When I set the thermostat to 75F on the High power setting when the room temperature was about 60F. In a few minutes, when the temperature had reached only 65F, the heater switched itself off! I understand that it could overheat, but why switch off permanently?! Then you need to actually unplug it for 30 minutes to reset the overheat protection."
2,Mediocre at best.,"This heater worked well in my son's bedroom (not a large room). However, it didn't make any difference in my the termperature of my living room.The wheels DO NOT stay on so the heater can't be moved unless it has been off for at least an hour. Otherwise you will get burnt.I have programmed the heater to reach 70 and after being plugged in and turned on for over 48 hours I can report that the heater has YET to reach 70 degrees. Luckily the room is warm enough with a reading of 63.I can't say that I would buy this again. And I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless their sole purpose is heating a small space."
3,"all good, but wheels","I got this one last week. all is good except the wheels which are too easy to fall apart. so literally, it can not be moved around - very disappointed."
2,"Decent lil heater, for 5 years","This can warm a small to medium size room adequately. I leave it on low setting most of the time, but when you need to heat up fast, this one beats the others for speed. In the morning, it can take my chilly small 8x10 office & make it very comfortable in less than an hour. And since I live at 5000' elevation in the mountains, this is quite impressive. Expect your utility bill to double or triple, when using 2 or 3 of these units to heat your home. Maybe Amazon should sell wood burning stoves next ;) UPDATE 2011 - after several years of heavy use, this heater began smoking and throwing electrical sparks. I think it could have started a house fire. Thanks goodness I was home to see it happening and unplugged it, which is why you should never leave a small portable heater on when you are not home."
3,The temperature display is not correct(5 or more less),"The temperature display is not correct(5F or more less). If you want to heat room to 70F, you may need to set to about 65F. I had to open the case, replace one register (12K to 13.76K)in circuit board to make it display and setting correctly.The temperature is not so precise as it said. The temperature will be in +/- 3F around the setting, 1F is favorable."
3,Big hydro user,"It works great, but since I started using it my hydro bills have increased dramatically. I guess you can't just turn it on & forget it. And their website is ""Under Construction"" so I can't ask them about it."
3,It's ok.,"What I do like about this book is that it covers igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks and their associated formation processes. However, I don't think that the style of writing used is very clear; I found many sections to be unnecessarily confusing. If you are an educator looking for a textbook for a course, I would recommend looking elsewhere."
3,Geology students,This book can be very informative if you know what you're looking for in it. I would reccomend it to students who are geology majors if it is not already required.
4,"5 stars for illustrations, 3 for text","This is one of the few books that I wish I could give separate star ratings for text and illustrations. I totally loved the glorious illuminated pages.Although the title does not give you a clue, this is an ABC picture book, using things from the Middle Ages as the ABC words. The words are interesting, but quite obscure, for example, A is for Alchemist, M is for Merlin, O is for Oriflamme, Q is for Quintain, and U is for Unicorn. The book is fun but has limited use for young children. Older children studying the middle ages might want to research the meaning of those words. Grades 3-6."
5,Ultimate,"Fastest CPU on the market today (03-26-07). My processor is no longer the bottleneck in my system. One small tweak and I had all four cores running at 2.93GHz. With the help of the Zalman CNPS9500, this bad boy stays under 40c overclocked. I am sure there will be a faster proc out in the near future, but for now, there is nothing that can touch this thing."
5,Authentic Intel processor,Got this used and it went in without a hitch. Lots of fakes going around so I Verified the authenticity using the Intel software. i've had it for over a month so far and it's been working flawlessly.
3,Fab,"This is a good mute, but a bit on the large side. Your tone will be much brighter, but as I said before, it's a little big."
1,Poor Quality,"This is the poorest quality blanket I have ever purchased. Immediately upon removing it from the packaging there was lint and fibers everywhere. Every time I put something on top of the blanket, it was filled with lint and particles of the blanket. I washed it to try to get some of the lint off and while drying, I had to clean out the dryer filter 3 times. I put it back on the bed and there's still lint and fibers everywhere. I do not want to constantly use a lint brush to remove the lint from my clothes or anything else I put on the bed. This blanket was a total waste of money since I cannot return it after washing it and throwing out the packaging."
2,"Poor Quality, highly overrated","I bought this blanket after reading the user and editor reviews.The quality of the blanket is far from what the reviewers have rated.First of all, the quality of the cotton used in making this blanket is very poor, it looks cheap and dirty, not a smooth material. The kind of good quality cottons that you get these days is amazing, this blanket is no where near to it.Second, the honeycomb pattern is not well woven, it gets stuck in finger and toe nails and can come off easily.Would never buy this blanket again"
5,Wonderful product,"We bought these to use as makeshift bedspreads for a set of twin beds in my daughter's room, until we could decide on a bedspread design. These waffle blankets were perfect: they don't shrink much in the dryer (although you need to change the lint filter twice, at least, during a dry cycle), are lightweight enough to use year-round, and are very soft and strong."
5,wonderful product,I would give this a 5 plus star review it is the most comfortable blanket I have ever owned. It is made out of 100% cotton which is does not make you sweat at night like the other blankets on the market. It is machine washable and comes out perfect everytime. I havent had such a good nights sleep in a long time. I highly recommend this product its wonderful.
3,cotton fiber sheds,"After reading all the reviews on several cotton blankets I decided to go for this one as ""the lesser of evils"". It shipped out promptly from Kansas, arrived in Houston 1 day later, was scanned in a 5:30 am and out for delivery later. It didn't come!!! Went back and checked status and it showed arrival in Houston again.....at 11 pm. It was to be delivered via DHL home, it came on the 10th via USPS. So, I guess like UPS, DHL has a deal with the post office to deliver packages, this delays delivery.I washed the blanket, had about half cup of fiber in washing machine. If this continues it's going back.Update, 12/28/07 I have washed this blanket 4 times, it still sheds like a long haired dog. Won't be any fabric left if that keeps up.Update, 04/08, sold it at a garage sale for 1.00. Nuff said."
5,Great calipers!,"These are great calipers to use for analyzing EKG strips. They're well-built, easy to carry, and seem to be very durable."
2,finally figured it out,"i suppose the mfg assumed that anyone who ordered these would know what they needed to do....But alas, i am a beginning ekg student and this came in a plastic bag without one piece of paper, instruction etc.after much fiddling around and looking at my online tutorial i was able - i think - to master it..."
5,"Excellent build quality, portable.","I bought these a few years ago while in Paramedic School. The review title says it all. They are built well. Not too loose/not too tight...they spread fine and hold their position. They are very small and fit in one of the pen pockets of my BDU pants for arguing the finer points of an ECG after running a call. Buy a pair, you'll be happy (well, maybe not about learning 12-lead ECG interpretation, but they come in handy when starting off and for interesting/obscure rhythms)"
5,Good mute!,This mute was delivered before the advertised time and I am very happy with it. My trombone practice sessions are better for it. I highly recommend this product for beginner trombonists and I am very happy with the Seller. Great product. Great Seller!
3,"Great to hear the legend live, but he's not superb","Yes, Stitt is one of the greatest bebop saxophists of all time.However, this performance is cool but not among his best.I suspect he may have been drinking on this gig. Nevertheless, his solos are amazing as always and the sidemen are competent. The guitarist is very good. I'd recommend it for ""live stitt"" if you already have Tenor Battle at Birdland and Just in Case You Forgot How Bad He Really Was."
4,Make sure you are getting the correct track listing!,"Be sure to check the track listing for this product when buying, as Amazon has several different issues confused. The 1995, 1999, 2001, and 2011 listings have track listings are all completely different from eachother. The same very negative review about sound quality appears at all these listings, so that reviewer's warning is rendered useless by Amazon. I have the 1999 issue - sounds fine."
1,Sensitive skin people-Don't Use !,"This product burned my face ,terribly.If you have sensitive skin be careful."
5,Great Replacement!!,My original battery could not withstand even for a day. Hence I decided to go for a replacement battery. I got this within a couple of days and I have been using it for the past 1.5 months. The charge now withstands for 3 full days with the same usage. This ia great replacement!!
1,Item sent was USED and not as pictured!,"Well, this was a poor buy. This company sent me a BR50 battery instead of what was pictured. It had scratches all over the contacts, obviously it was used. The charge doesn't last, not surprising. I was already in Europe before discovery, so little recourse now. I cannot recommend the seller at this point. Buyer beware."
1,Do NOT buy this product - It won't work!!!!,I bought this because my old bettery is down. I need to charge it twice per day. I thought this product would help. NO! I was wrong. It is no difference then my old bettery. I need to charge it every day! I have to pay $4.95 for the postage. It's not worth to return it. Warning: this is a junk! Do not purchase it! I think this company is not selling new bettery. They just sent me an old bettery that they have collected from some where.
1,Save your money,I have to charge the new battery every night and it still doesn't hold a charge all day long. I don't use it that much either. Now I'll be looking for a new battery which will last longer than 12 hours without use.
3,Got it Quick and worked fine with Razor.,Got it in 2 days and it worked great the first time withmy Razor Phone.
4,A Wonderful Study of the Anti-Nazi Resistance,"Like Albert Speer and Walter Schellenberg, Whilhelm Canaris is one of those enigmatic figures who emerged from the Third Reich. Hohne's book, 'Canaris: Hitler's Master Spy,' is a penetrating look at Hitler's head of military intelligence during World War Two. Hohne traces the rise of Canaris from his days as a lieutenant in World War One to his tenure as head of the Ahwehr and finally to his ultimate downfall at the hands of the Gestapo. The narrative does sometimes go off on tangents (notably the chapters on Canaris's role in the murders of communist leaders in the 1920's,) but also provides amazing insights into German foreign intelligence and the military conspiracy against Hitler that culminated in the July 20th 1944 bomb attempt. For anyone interested in World War Two espionage, the inner-workings of Nazi Germany, or deeper matters of conscience, Hohne's book will more than delight."
5,Amazing career,I found this book to be an interresting and fast paced look into the little known life and death of one of the Third Reich's most ellusive characters. Certainly there has been less written about Admiral Canaris than most of the key figures on Nazi Germany and this book is a valuable work which provides details of Canaris' career from his earliest ventures into the world of espionage prior to World War I. I consider this a supurb reference and a critical piece of my WW2 collection.
1,NO Value. Useless without workbook.,This title cannot be used on its own. At its price its a real Steal - if you know what I mean.
3,VHS Video,This is a basic how to setup and run a garden railroad. It is fun to watch and shows the whole family enjoying the hobby. I got several great ideas from it. I used it more as a sales tool to show my wife how a model railroad would fit into her garden hobby. She enjoys gardening and I enjoy model trains so I thought it would be a natural blend of our hobbies so we could spend more time together.
5,Great overall rolling storage.,Easy to assemble. Easily holds heavier files without losing shape. Rolls easily. The top is a great bonus because you can use the flat surface when you don't need access to the files. It also keeps the office space neater looking.
2,ek success curvy cutter,I find this cutting system to be too big and heavy to take to crops and it takes a lot of space plus you need a glass cutting mat to use it.
2,Staying Warm But Awake,"it makes a loud noise when you turn it on..and when the machine turns itself on it also makes a loud noise. loud noises are not cool when trying to catch some zzz. i recommened buying another product..oh yeah...the one touch buttons is a pain in the (EDITED)...its only one button, which you have to keep pressing to change the setting.."
2,An ok heater,"The good:1. It does heat.The bad:1. When it turns on it makes a loud buzzing noise for about 30 seconds and then it quiets down. If you set the heater to keep a certain temperature (thermostat feature) this noise gets very annoying since the heater turns on and off repeatedly.2. The heater has a few temperature and power settings (in all about 10 distinct settings). There is also just a single lonely button. To turn the heater on you press this button repeatedly to reach the desired setting. When you want to turn the heater off you press the same button until you reach the ""off"" position. So, you will be pressing this button a LOT.To sum up:If your environment is noisy as is and you planning to just set this thing to hold a particular temperature (60 - 80 in 5 degree increments) and never touch it again then you might want to consider this heater."
2,Unhappy customer,This heater is a good heat producer BUT the heat tubes go out FREQUENTLY I thought maybe I just got a bad machine but after replacing THREE units and still having the same problem one must conclude that it just doesn't measure up
4,"Not THAT loud, reliable","I'm impressed with it's ability to heat a medium sized room. I also noticed that the electric bill didn't increase much as a result of frequent use. I've had mine for two years and one side blew (don't ask me how). In any event, the unit has a 6 year warranty, so I will reutrn it for repair/ replacement. In the meanwhile, I will purchase another to hold me over until the original one returns. Yes, though half the unit blew out, I will buy another b/c it's not noisy and can heat a room faster than a fan forced heater."
3,Half of Heater Stopped Heating,"I purchased this heater 01-24-03 from Lowes. I used it last year and stored it all summer. I took it out of storage and only one side glows and heats.Yes there is a 6 year warranty IF you pack it and ship it back to Holmes and enclose a $10.00 fee. Shipping and Handling is $8.00, therefore the 6 year warranty costs you $18.00. I paid $49.88 for the heater at Lowes.To get the 'free' warranty, it will cost me 36% of the purchase price. Not a good deal at all!I doubt that I will be purchasing another 6 year free warranty or a Holmes product."
2,Quit working!,I bought my heater less than a year ago and one day it just shut off and wouldn't turn back on. I tried using the reset button but that did no good. I loved the heater when it was working but apparently they are not made to last long!
3,Good for spare parts,"I bought this with the sole purpose of cannibalizing it for the quartz rods. They are REALLY expensive, assuming you can find them separately. Made a kicking paint stripper with them, from directions found at ""My Paint Stripper"". I doubt Holmes cares WHY we buy these. For the intended purpose they're kind of ... not good. As sources of parts, you can't find em cheaper even on EBay."
3,Not the best introduction....,"to Dr. Samenow's work. The reader would be better to forego this until reading Inside the Criminal Mind. Dr. Samenow has collected questions from lectures over the years from the audience and compiled them into a topical format. This book is somewhat of a rehash of earlier works, but the topical format makes it a good quick reference to his ideas on various aspects of criminality. I recommend this as a companion to Inside the Criminal Mind as well as The Criminal Personality to all who are working in evaluation and treatment of criminals."
2,Anglo Saxon Military Institutions On The Eve Of The Norman Conquest.,"I found C. Warren Holister's book difficult to read and in many places a bit confusing. I had to read chapters 3,4 and 5 twice in order to understand the Fyrd and Hide system. The Fyrd being the Army being raised by a Lord or the King, the Five Hide Unit being a system of determining the number of men a geographical entity had to provide to the Fyrd. Understanding these two subjects made the book worth reading. I enjoyed the chapter on Tactics and Strategy."
5,"Wonderful, beautiful, just great.","I bought this CD awhile back and I just love the Chant. It really is beautiful, and is the most enjoyable type of music, because it is pure melody. I listen to it about everyday and I am glad I bought it. Highly recommended."
3,Chanting and Coughing,"This cd has it's moments for quality meditation but I found the quality of the recording distracting. It is not a highly professional production. At the beginning and during some of the pieces there is obvious coughing and clearing of throats. I purchased it specifically for ""Litany of the Saints"" and am somewhat disappointed but will use it until I find a better version. If you don't mind the sounds effects then you will enjoy this cd."
1,Story of a slimebag,"As I read this book I got angrier and angrier. It is poorly written, and, being a former student of his, find it hard to believe that he actually wrote a book, but given the quality of the writing can understand the quality of the book. He was one of the worst teachers that I ever had. In this book, this man exaults himself and seeks to get the reader to believe that he some kind of saint. I know better! I knew this fellow, the family of his victims, which he maligns, and the people of the town it all happened in! His presentation of himself and what he did is the self-justification of an egomaniac! I was not duped by him for a moment! Don't you be either! This book would not even make good material for a doorstop! Don't bother reading it! I know the time I spent reading it was wasted time I will never get back!"
1,another point of view,"I have not yet read the full book, but since I am a former student of his, I do not have to. I lived it. Keep in mind that many of us believe he is guilty, and not wrongly accused!"
1,Courneya was quilty,"I grew up in Hancock, MN, lived there for over 20 years. I had Dennis Courneya for a teacher and coach. I saw first hand how he treated women and how he talked about them. It was about time someone spoke up and said what he was doing. His book is a complete cover-up from him-trying to make himself look better, because of all the bad stuff he has done to young women. To me this book just proves his quilt!"
1,Link to the Case,"[...]I will say, as a life-long educator and former high school coach, even if Mr. Courneya is not guilty of criminal activity (which I believe he probably is), he is guilty of extraordinarily poor judgement and unprofessional behavior.As a male coach, you don't give backrubs to students, you don't touch a girl's thigh, and you certainly don't ask a young girl to ""give you some lovin'."" Any teacher with half a brain knows that. In the appeal it states that ""...he admitted to touching students frequently, either by feeling their muscles or rubbing their backs. He recalled making statements to L.G. such as 'your boyfriend's lucky' and admitted two nicknames he had for C.H.""If he does not have any more common sense than that, he has no business working with young people.In addition, the book is not very well written."
5,WHY WASN'T THE MOVIE LIKE THIS??,"This was a great biography. I foolsihly thought that the movie was accurate, but this book proves me wrong. It would have been good for the movie to be just like this book, but of course the show business just wants to make it look good to make a profit! As well, maybe the movie makers had to change some things around or they would get sued. If I were going to make a movie about him, I would base it on this book. The movie was a good movie, but not truly about the real Ritchie Valens...same as the Buddy Holly Story."
1,"A complicated, and confusing read","The First Latino Rocker jumps around more than a 2 year old on a sugar fix. It is terribly written, yet the author says it was 20 years in the making. My grade school cousin can write a one page book report with more info on a subject, than Ms. Mendheim gives in 175 pages. After the first 3 or 4 pages she has jumped from his infancy, to his musical career several times. Halfway through you are so confused with his story you have to continuously look back towards the front to see what the hay is going on. Let's just hope she does not quit her day job. The only high point in the book are the photo's."
3,"not great, but functional","I had a Felco pruner and it began to stick. Being on a stricter budget, I decided to try a thirteen dollar pruner instead of a fifty dollar pruner. It works but is much more flimsy and poorly made. I wonder how long it will last."
3,Expected More,"First let me say that you are purchasing one visor not a set. The polarized idea is ok and does help with the sunlight. The visor is easy to put on and stays in place. However, the quality of the construction of straps was poor. One strap was way too long, so the excess was flapping in the breeze. The other shorter strap was not glued on correctly and is now coming off the visor after a short time in the heat of the sun. I will have to try to reglue it. For the cost of this item and especially since I also had to pay for shipping, I expected better. I did not contact the company to send it back for a replacement."
4,a help on the road,"easily installed, folds up out of the way easily, works well (I use it with polarized sunglasses for extra protection when driving into the sun). My only complaint is how short it is; I used to have another brand of visor that covered more ground and I would prefer that one if I could locate how to get it (it was given me as a gift). However, it covers enough area to be very helpful, anyway. So far I haven't scratched it and it's easy to clean (e.g., oily fingerprints). I recommend it"
3,It's a three-star/five-star product,"I love that this product is natural and safe to apply to your skin all summer long. That would get five stars from me!What gets three stars: the texture and the smell. I don't love the texture. It's a thicker, pastier kind of sunscreen than I'm used to. If you don't really really rub it in, it tends to leave a ghostly film on your skin. Also, it stains your clothes (not permanently, but if you get some on your shirt/bathing suit, it leaves visible residue which must be washed off).Also, the smell of it takes some getting used to, it's kind of organic (think of cut grass) -- I suppose this is the green tea."
4,One of the best books with practical illustrations..........,"I read this book sometime back...and I haven't yet found a copy of this marvellous book. Infact a couple of years back, Billy Graham Evangelistic Association gave a free copy of this book to all its subscribers to Decision magazine. Lynn Anderson takes us the through the life of King David and practically he helps us to explores the trials, predicaments and fallacies of our lives....together with studying King David's life. The complete study when you take it helps you to find the heart to go on in this troublesome world - whatwith all the temptations of flesh and the idiosyncrasies of our own making. A wonderful book for any believer aspiring to get practical insights into David's life."
1,You got to be kidding,"This book tells you absolutely nothing about setting up an E-commerce site. It wouldn't even qualify as a good glossary.It tells you nothing about design or even how to set up secure transmissions. It just describes sites that have e-commerce technology. If you are looking for useless information, this is a good start! Give me a refund!"
5,E-Tailing is a Must-Read for All Businesses,"""E-Tailing"" is a great book for any business owner who wants to have a better understanding of electronic commerce. I have had a web site for three years, but now have a new understanding of the elements that create a stronger online presence. Bernadette Tiernan has successfully managed to address e-tailing in an easy-to-understand and comprehensive manner. I have specialized in business planning for many years and would advise every business teacher and student, and business owner to familiarize themselves with and utilize the concepts presented in ""E-Tailing"". Kudos for doing a great job of addressing a difficult subject."
3,It's better than nothing.,"This book has some great songs but I bought it especially so I could learn ""Where Everybody Knows Your Name"" the theme song for the TV show Cheers.Well, to make a long story short, the sheet music for the song in the book does not match up to the real song and there are typos here and there. Which is very frustrating to a new piano player like myself.So I've had to learn the song elsewhere.The book does get your started though!"
1,Do not buy this book if you bought last years,"I bought the 2004 edition which I rate at 5 stars, but this book is a word perfect copy except the days of the week change.What a con!Talk about money for old rope."
5,Intense,"This is a wonderful, intense story. I don't think my three-year-old understands it yet but I think it will be a good one in later years. Themes that are real for children and unlikely to bore adults."
1,Don't waste your money,"The best thing about this book is the photo on the front cover, and it goes rapidly downhill from there.Please, please, please, I am begging you - if you are looking for resources for self-defence, look elsewhere. Trusting your life or body to anything presented in it is like buying lottery tickets to cover your retirement.Here's an example of what I mean. Is a sexual predator more likely to attack a woman in a big open area, and stand 3 feet away? Of course not, he's going to be in her face, restricting her movement as much as possible. So why doesn't the book work from there? In a car? On a couch? There's a brief section where the woman is on the ground/on a bed, but it is _so_ brief it is like the author is embarrassed by it all.I can't say it enough, don't buy this book"
1,Good when it worked,"First space heater I have purchased so I don't have much to compare it too. It worked well for 4-5 nites and then I woke up FREEZING at 5:00 in the morning. The heater was dead and I could not get it started again. Returning it to Amazon with their awesome return policy because I need a heater NOW. I will say I must have just gotten a defective one because when it worked it really did a nice job though it did seem a bit noisy. But, I don't have anything to compare it too so maybe all space heaters sound like this."
3,Good for Awhile,"In 1999, after moving into our new home, we bought a HEATLOGIC HFH-435BR Holmes heater and it worked great for about 1 1/2 years. We used it approx. 50 times per year. After 1 1/2 years it would only work if you unplugged it and let it sit for an hour or two. Since we were out of warranty we operated like this until now. Maybe it is not the heaters fault but something we did to it. Am going to buy a new one and hope they have fixed any problems if it was the heater. We certainly got ""our money's worth"" of pleasure out of it, hence my 3 star rating vs. a lower rating.Hope this helps someone. Jack"
5,THE essential Mark Twain reference work,"If you could have only one Mark Twain reference guide on your shelf, this would be the book to choose. This two volume set could more properly be titled EVERYTHING YOU EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT MARK TWAIN BUT NEVER EVEN KNEW ENOUGH TO ASK. It is a massive desk dictionary whose first volume provides plot summaries of all of Twain's works, describes each of his characters, and includes critical background materials. The second volume is a desk dictionary of every person, place, and topic pertaining to Twain's life and writings, along with a very useful chronology of his entire life, and an extensive index. Mark Twain lovers will read these volumes cover to cover with pleasure and then refer back to them for years to come. Those seeking a more informative detailed analysis of this work may go to the Mark Twain Forum and read the review written by esteemed Mark Twain scholar Alan Gribben."
5,Watched it years ago!,"I first watched it years ago and it hasn't lost it's punch. Michael Pare is a favorite actor of mine, but a little wooden in this one."
4,Great soundtrack!,This disc is well worth the 24.00 at the Bubba-Hotep.com page. Very original music with memorable tracks that never get tiring to listen to. Good movie also.
3,"More like an essay, rather than a book","I found the content to be a good overview of Globalization in general. However, this is a very short and very small book and not worth the price. Mr. Giddens basically took a speach on Globalization and tried to turn it into a book. I think you can get a better overview (and cheaper) by reading a few articles published on the topic. You could also get a more in-depth book, of which there are plenty out there."
2,airplane reading,"I realize that this book was created for the masses, but it insults intelligence and makes some sweeping generalizations and essentially promotes a Western imperialist tradition. Giddens admits to some of the criticism of globalization but he glosses over the horrors of ecological risk and global inequalities and touts the joys of democracy as being spread by globalization which results in ""pure love"" relationships. Somewhat of a stretch of the imagination and too much to cover in 83 little pages with big print. No references make it useless for an interested reader."
2,underdeveloped,"Giddens doesn't provide new arguments to the globalization theme. The arguments he does present are underdeveloped and could use much more solid backing up. I found myself confused many times by his circular arguments. The book ends awkwardly, the writing is choppy, and his stance is vague."
3,Some lame book from big star,"Giddens has a very big name. but name is name. this book has nothing new or insightful. all are there is reproduced from his previous books. and worse, the pricing is unduly high. if u read already his books, u'd better skip this title."
3,"If you have been living under a rock, this book is for you.","Aside from the reflection that neoliberalism is another fundamentalist mouvement in western world, there is too much superficial general knowledge about the state of the planet.I am even more deceived to see that this book is has a scale down approach of Modernity and self identity.This book is by far too expensive for a one sitting, basic overlook of the state of the world."
3,A good leisure book,"This is a very thin book and easy to read. For anyone who wants to know more about some current debates about globalization, I think it provides a good introduction. For example, the problems of tradition and globalization are precisely discussed. If you look for something more, you will be disappointed."
5,Dome Magnifier,"FOR FOLKS LIKE ME WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AARP, READING THE SMALL ""DIAMOND""PRINT ON EVERYTHING FROM MEDICATION TO FOOD TO ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSEI GET AT THE STORE, AND SEEING THOSE TINY ALMOST MICROSCOPIC LETTERS CAN BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT A MAGNIFYING GLASS. AND FOR ME DOME MAGNIFIERS, THE LARGER THE BETTER ARE THE EASIEST TO USE, SINCE I CANPUT ONE OR THE BOOKS, PAPERS, OR LABELS I NEED TO READ AND JUST MOVE ITAROUND WITHOUT LIFTING THEM OFF THE PAGE.AND NOT ONLY THAT, THE HEMISPHERE OR DOME MAGNIFIERS CONCENTRATE THEAVAILABLE LIGHT ONTO THE PAGE OR SURFACE YOU ARE LOOKING AT TO MAKE ITMORE VISIBLE STILL.SO IF YOU ARE NOT A FAN OF HOLDING ONTO A MAGNIFYING GLASS THAT YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY ADJUST WHILE MAKING YOUR ARM TIRED AT THE SAME TIME, THEN DOME MAGNIFIERS COULD THE ANSWER YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. THEY WERE FORME."
2,BORING!,"This movie is so boring and the lines are so poor that you could sleep on it. What keeps you awake is sex scenes, and attractive actors. Unfortunately actors don't play very well-they sound like they reading from white board behind camera :)This is edited version. There is porn version of that movie as well."
2,NAKED and BAD,"So they are naked. That isn't enough to watch this thing. If you are into extremely beautiful men and explicitly gay-themed independent movies. SUGAR, GRANDE ECOLE and NEVERLAND (the gay themed Peter Pan - NOT the Johnny Depp movie!) are far more impressive. Even NEVERLAND's prison/bondage thing at the end with the lost boys tied up and in jail is sexier than this. Just because guys are naked doesn't make it hot."
2,Disappointing,"I found this movie was disappointing and the acting amateurish. The nude scenes were scarce and brief (unlike the hype)and I'm someone who believes that good full-frontal nudism will salvage any dog. But this old dog just don't hunt. If you can't resist the hype, rent don't buy."
2,Soft-Core Snoozer,"Just like a hardcore porn movie, this has almost no plot, story, character development. Unlike a hardcore porn movie, there's no real sex.Incredibly boring. The soft core sex scenes are pretty tame. What little story there is is incredible trite and contrived. Poorly made soft-core version of the prison segment of American History X where the black and white characters find some squishy love instead of friendship. Yawn.Actually, I've seen some porn movies that have better stories, dialoge and acting."
2,watch one time,save a few dollars and get these on Netflix. you might watch them more than once but more than likely not.
3,Not The TV Show,"Oh dear. All those innocents, thinking this is ""Locked Up Abroad"" only to realize it's an ""R"" rated gay porn film. One can hear the cursing! Yes, this is what people say they want, a porn film with a story. A long, feature length story in this case, and with actors who can actually deliver their lines convincingly. And there's lots of nudity, and partial sex scenes.Again, it's an X-rated film with the actual sex cut out. It's not art, it's porn. Porn with a story. If you thought otherwise, boy are you in for a surprise!"
2,Fairly HOT soft core prison flick!,"Erotic content good (requisite shower/rape scenes with ample full frontal footage). Dramatic content NOT very good or believable. Do German prisons really allow inmates to choose their cellmates and to set up housekeeping as lovers? Attractive actors. The ""special features"" interview with the 2 lead actors is very ""honest"" and worth listening to to hear their views on porn. Apparently the sex scenes are ""hardcore"" according to the actors, although the scenes appear to have been edited--perhaps for the US release?"
3,more prison CAMP,"The black character says he's American, but he has the most obvious British accent in the world. He can't speak a word of German, yet the couple seem to understand each other. With all the Black American soldiers in Germany, the director is telling the viewers he couldn't find a single Black American who spoke German (or could take a crash course) to play this role? Further, the black guy is kinda queeny. I don't think he would survive in an American jail. Yet in this film, he is DA MAN, and both white German prisoners and officers are in awe of him. This movie is a watered-down ""Oz"" written by some German who's obviously worships us brothas. And worse, the English subtitles were riddled with spelling errors. That only added to the campiness of the film."
3,Watchable but not high-art,"The first thing that strikes you about this film is that it can't decide whether it's soft porn or a sexy drama. It's filed on video, (albeit with single camera) and the sound and music are a little poor; just like cheap porn! On the plus side, there's a love story, and the lead, Dennis, is very attractive. It's shot in a disused prison, so no wobbly studio sets; but there's a lack of attention to detail, eg. one prisoner has a tongue-stud (unlikely to be allowed) and there's a distinct lack of discipline. The DVD extra's include a lengthy interview with the two lead actors, I found this more interesting than the feature and shows an insight into such a film making process, if you're interested!"
2,Interacial love between male prisoners!,"This DVD was entertaining at best,but the production quality really sucked.It appeared like the movie was shot on video tape instead of film.The two main chracters were eye-candy,and they seemed to have good chemistry,but I felt like the writer or director was basically filming his sexual fantasy.It would have made a better rental than purchase!"
1,A Sorry Excuse for Homo-Eroticism,"I was given this video as a gift, and was very glad I didn't waste any money on it after viewing it. Set in a German male prison, this is a particularly bad take on Oz-style gay male prison fantasies; though to say so is an insult to that HBO series, which at least had some good acting and interesting psychological situations to recommend it. This has neither, nor any other redeeming qualities. ""Locked Up"" comes across as what your average, run-of-the-mill middle-class gay white-boy with a lite S&M/B&D fetish, along with his Snow Queen boyfriend, would fantasize about as a world of sex-deprived virile young men would be like. Dream on girlfriend! Don't waste your time with this if you don't happen to fall into the aforementioned demographics."
2,another D list wana be porn,It just is not there the story line bad and the actors are not good looking.
2,Amduscias.. Interesting,"Ok. First off, let me say that I have 4 settings on my EQ. They are: rock, metal, rap, and Amduscias. Yes, I have my own setting for this cd. It has all the high frequencies taken out and some of the lower ends pushed up. Why? Because this cd sounds so horribly mixed any other way and you couldn't listen to it any louder to hear the lyrics. I was also amazed when I flipped open the cd booklet and saw that they had a bassplayer. I could not hear any bass throughout this whole cd. On the other hand, I did like the style of vocals and the guitar riff in the beginning of The Dragon Domination."
3,good black metal,"this is a good cd, the only problem i have with it is that it sounds like all other black metal bands. they all have the same blast beats, rough vocals, and riffs. this cd is just like Ulver, Dark Throne, or Cradle Of Filth. buy this only if u really like black metal."
3,double check,"according to the recon website, this part # fits my SUV but it didn't. amazon had a quick turn around with the refund so i give 3 stars for the great service."
3,recon third brake light,"The brake light portion of the assembly works phenomenally but the bed illumination lights are a real let down, not bright enough."
3,A Very Thorough Text,This book is very thorough. It is not meant for casual reading. It is meant for deep studying. It would be good for a one semester course. The reader must be very familiar with the Old Testament.
1,Not worth it,"I had to get this book for an Old Testament class. The class is a waste of time, the book is a waste of money, and there seems to be a lot of extra stuff in it that I couldn't care less about. If you're getting this book for a class, it's easy to read, but it takes forever. If you're getting it just for fun, I recommend finding another book."
4,Brilliant book on the Old Testament,"I had to use Boadt's book for 1st semester scripture in 2004, and have since used this book in my own research into the Old Testament. A marvellous work that touches on a host of topics, such as the Documentary Hypothesis, multiple authorship of Isaiah, Daniel as a psuedipigraphia, and so forth.This is one book that must be on the book shelf of all scripture aficinados everywhere."
1,Infected with Anti-Semitism and Anti-Catholicism,"Lawrence Boadt strongly bases his discussions of the Torah on the theories of Julius Wellhausen, a 19th century German rationalist who doubted the ""authenticity"" of the Torah. A historic revisionist, Wellhausen claimed that he was presenting the ""true"" story of the Torah when in fact his theories called the whole foundation of the Jewish religion into question. Although this book is published by a ""Catholic"" press (Paulist), it is also infected with anti-Catholicism. One, after all, cannot be anti-Semitic and also pro-Catholic. To suggest that large portions of the Torah were falsified is also to suggest that Catholicism is falsified at its very foundations. Jesus, after all, was a Jew; and as Pope Benedict XVI has said, without Abraham, there would be no Christmas. The Jewish people are Catholics'elder brothers and sisters in the faith. Judaism and Catholicism go hand-in-hand. This book should be soundly rejected by Jews and Christians alike."
5,Great cable !,"I bought the 50 foot of the same brand , and ran both up 2 floors , for 2 seperate installs . Very good quality cable , and i would buy again ."
4,The Baptism of Howie Cobb,"The Baptism of Howie Cobb is an enjoyable story about a boy who left Georgia and rode a bus to South Dakota to work in a CCC camp. Howie left Georgia without understanding life, love, romance, or God. Through his adventures, sometimes frightening and sometimes comical but always enjoyable to read, Howie Cobb becomes a man. Dr. Robbins selects details carefully. He has a superior skill with dialogue. It has been said that he is indebted to Steinbeck in his style. He pays careful attention in The Baptism of Howie Cobb to the overall structure of the novel. Particularly noteworthy is his use of the geographical properties of various parts of the United States to develop the plot of the novel. At the same time, he ties the plot and the setting to the rich use of symbolism in the novel. I recommend it for entertaining reading."
5,Plentiful tunes from gutsy songstress,"Soulful, rich and resonant...that is the voice of the mega talented Bonnie Bramlett, presented in more than 20 wonderful tracks here, combining her solos and collaborations from two seperate albums. I bought this CD from an amazon.com marketplace vendor and saved about 50% off the ""New"" price. Even so, it would have been worth full price...so great is the heart and voice of this rocker chick!Also great are the enclosed liner notes which tell you alot about the artist and the woman. I'm a new fan and will definitely be an avid one for some time to come! Check her out!"
4,"HADES ""Alone Walkyng""","Due to wide demand, the HADES (of Norway) has had their original three song 1993 demo, ""Alone Walkyng"" re-pressed finally on to cd format courtesy of WOUNDED LOVE RECORDS. For a demo, it's rather lengthly, exceeding twenty minutes. Likewise, the quality of music is also quite superior to the average demo, however, the sound is not exactly clear on this recording. One should expect crusty and necro sounding, dismal production. This should not be considered a drawback, though. The style of production actually enhances an already profoundly present atmosphere of utter melancholy and despairity. Thus, depression is a characteristic that pervades the music and lyrics of HADES and reaches its zenith on the title track, ""Alone Walkyng"". All said, an excellent debut performance by this presently silent Norwegian pagan black metal band."
5,The Trews... A Fresh Breath of Rock n Roll!!!,"I have to admit before I saw them perform at Underground in Ontario I've never even heard of them (being American and all...) but now I'm a converted Trews fan! They're an absolute fresh breath of hard rock air from all the R&B and rock boy bands that seem to have taken over the radio airwaves. A positive comparison I can make is that their music has a similar vibe to Foo Fighters. They're touring in the US soon which I'm so glad because these talented boys rock hard live. I've never written a customer review before but I'm so eager to share this great band with anyone and EVERYONE! Songs that are a must listen are: Poor Ol' Broken Hearted Me, Yearning, So She's Leaving and Ana & Mia. So who are The Trews? They're just good ol' rock n roll man. APRIL 18, get the album!"
5,Almighty...Let's Hear Vol. 5,"Almighty Records produces the BEST Euro-Dance music! Almost all of their remixed tracks contain strong vocals with an awesome masterbeat. I really love listening to this Almighty series of UK mixes! But, if you're a frequent club kid who is looking for the next new hotness, then you should stay away from buying this and any other album produced by various artists."
1,MP3 Download Version Review,"SERIOUSLY screwed samples on this cd so buy the hard copy because you never know for sure if they mixed the songs up as well. IF you want to listen to a particular track to see if you want to buy it and it plays wrong? LISTEN to the wrong track and it will be the right sample. Yes, crazy I know. Hope this helps someone not buy the wrong track"
1,Too firm for us,I read the 3 reviews before purchasing and thought it sounded great. Unfortunately I am finding itfar too firm -the first night was like sleeping on a brick. My husband likes it when sleeping on his back but thats not good as he then snores! To be fair it was clear that this was a firm pillow but I would warn that it is very firm and although I am persevering it will soon be relegated to the spare room and my search will continue.
1,If you like a warm pillow...,"I have slept on many pillows and this is the hottest one I've ever experienced. Within seconds of laying my head down, the pillow got very hot and stayed that way. The style and firmness was good but I had to change back to my old pillow within hours due to the heat."
5,It's up and running!,"This book really worked for me. To give you some background, I'm a former web developer (now in business school) who needed a server for both a start-up business of mine and some home stuff that a laptop wouldn't be suitable for. I had never built a box before, but Tony laid out the steps and crucial tips very well. This isn't a ""Building a Server for Dummies"" exactly, as Tony assumes that you have at least an average to above-average level of computer proficiency (which is a good assumption, otherwise you probably would have no reason to want to build a server).I will agree with another reviewer who claims the book is very Microsoft-centric, and doesn't address the huge costs of Win 2003 server licenses. However, in my opinion, the first few chapters about hardware alone are worth the price of the book, and the topics addressed in the software chapters can easily apply to a Linux installation as well."
2,"Decent ""how to"" with a heavy Microsoft bias","The book has some good practical hardware information.But software? I wonder how much Microsoft is paying him for the ""Pro Microsoft"" BIAS? I hope quite a bit because it really degrades what he could have done. Microsoft and ""Low Cost"" do not belong in the same sentence, but that sentence is on the cover of the book! He does give cursory service to Linux. But for the $700-1,000 you pay for MS Server 2000/2003 with 5 user licenses, you could ""rent a geek"" for three or four days, install Linux for an unlimited number of users, and have a leaner meaner better running machine in the end! Or you could figure it out yourself using the ample resources on the Internet or the library for free!Bottom line: Money talks and MS walks! At least for a low cost server."
4,"Wonderful book, but seems to be out of print","Most fathering books focus on advice like ""don't tell your wife she looks fat."" This book is much more. Very thoughtful. Designed for the man who is interested in the emotional journey of becoming a father. I think this is a great book for people who are fathers or fathers-to-be, or even men considering becoming fathers..."
1,Coaster-maker,"I have the USB version of this thingie, which works up to 4x for CD-burning, and deliberately went out of my way, and paid an extra $au300 for the Firewire adapter. The adapter plus my Predator is EXACTLY what you are buying here, except you wouldn't also have the USB adapter.What a waste of money.Firewire, at 8x speed, is essentially too fast for the Predator software, and the whole CD-burning process will freeze you machine (and ultimately crash it) and you'll have another coaster to add to the collection. You simply have to run the Predator at 4-speed and just accept the limitation.But, unless you're a bozo like me who doesn't read US-based reviews before he buys, there are plenty of other CD-RWs out there that get far better reviews than the Predator.Look carefully, waste no money."
1,Really loud,"In addition to the other problems noted here, it is very, very loud -- a combination of a noisy motor and a lot of vibration as well (so it both hums and buzzes). The QUE QPS drive is much quieter, but also about twice as thick."
2,Very disappointed,"I thought this would be the perfect solution. I hoped to use it with my PC laptop as well as my iBook and G4. Whoops. My ratio of successful burns to wasted CD-R blanks is about 5 to 1. That really inflates the cost of media.Connections are suspect, provided software doesn't support much, and other applications don't recognize the drive.I'm ready to give up while I still can. I sure hope this is not the state of the art."
1,Painful!! What a disappointment,"I actually preordered this prior to its release about 3 years ago, and since have wasted countless discs additional money on a Firewire PC card (didn't help at all) and have banished this unit in the trash heap of old PC parts. I eventually purchased an internal CD burner for my laptop, and a different Iomega external drive.Frankly, I'm surprised Iomega still develops this product. Reading these current reviews, I see the same problems I communicated with them in the past have not been resolved.I think they named it the Predator since it acts as a Predator to your CDs, rendering them useless and causing an amazing amout of frustration."
1,Biggest piece of junk I've every bought...,"If you have a shortage of coasters this is the drive for you. The software doesn't load correctly for either my pc or mac and after spending no less than 6 hours on the phone with Iomga's support, I give up. I would rate this thing with negative stars if possible."
1,Not Good for Windows Me,"I bought this drive from Amazon a year ago for my Laptop which has windows Me, and it has been nothing but a problem using this drive. Everytime I add a new hardware the CD RW drive stops working and have to reinstall the entire OS and all softwares all over again in the Hard drive. Wish I had never bought this product. My experience is a real bad one the drive conflicts with new Hardwares Like Palm Pilot, Sony USB drives for Digital Camcorders or Still Cameras the most. There should be a better software for this device. One That is compatible with most Operating systems and devices and softwares."
1,Horrible design,"This was useless, it is so small, you can barely hold the tiny handle with your thumb and foregfinger.I tossed it in the trash."
2,Cool - but needs more refinement,"I liked this concept so much, however the actually function was not as good as I expected. The machine uses a spinning electrode to display information. This make a fairly audible humming sound that bothered me.My biggest complaint is that the globe displays information all the time. I was hoping the unit would have a ""sleep mode"", and would only display a incoming call, but it doesn't. Thus if the unit is turned on, the unit displays date and time, or other messages 24-hrs a day. This was distracting, we sent the unit back for a refund."
4,lots of fun,"I got this for my parents for Christmas after their other caller ID died after an electrical storm.My mother called to tell me that it was working and quite entertaining to watch. She said it made an audible noise, but since neither of my parents hear too well AND since they sleep with the TV on, it doesn't bother them.My less than perfect rating is that the thing shipped with almost dead batteries. Batteries are included, but after my mom hooked it up, the message it read out was ""Batt Low."""
2,Cool gadget but too noisy,"The gadget is very cool, but it's only drawback is a loud humming noise. Sounds like an airplane. It may work in a noisy environment, but not in a bedroom."
5,Infoglobe is really cool,"I've had one of these little toys since Christmas and it works beautifully, no trouble at all. Now I did have probelms with the first one, it wouldn't really ever work, but I think it was damaged because the Radio Shack it was purchased at only had 2, and my mom bought the other one and hers didn't work either. I ordered this one and it has been awesome. I love the messages I can set myself, it has never failed to display an incoming number, you can see the info from across the room, and the whole thing is just really cool in appearance.Sure the engine is audible- if you're about 3 inches from it! Mine sits on my computer desk next to my phone, and I never evcen notice any sounds. Friends who come over and see it are fascinated."
4,"fun,practical gadget",My first info globe lasted a little over a year.. But.i loved it so much that i replaced it and added another in a different room.. Have had the two now almost two years... Not bad for a cheap 39 bucks... Wish the could add a alarm clock feature to it. Its GREAT not having to get up at night when the phone rings to see who's calling.. Easy to see in the dark and the noise is minimal and almost hypnotic... Acts almost like one of those wave or ambiant noise makers that are suppose to put you to sleep.. Going to buy another one to have as a spare as i can't imagine being with out one in the bedroom and having to get up every time the phone rings at night...
3,Christmas Gift Gone Bad :o(,"I purchased this item for my boyfriend as a christmas gift. We really enjoyed the product, and so did all of our guests! It was really cool to not have to get up to look @ the little caller id screen on the phone. However, the luxury did not last, about a week after running it, it stopped working. It was still making the noise it makes, but nothing would come up on the screen. After going through all the trouble shooting in the mannual, I decided to exchange it for a new one. When I took the item back to exchange it, there weren't anymore in stock. So now I'm on the look out for where I can buy another, because I really did enjoy the product, I just hope when I do find a new one, it lasts."
2,No Instructions,Though this is a great novelty item there were no instructions and it is quite loud. I have to unplug it every now and then just so not to be annoyed by the sound.
4,It's cool enough for the money. Get it.,"Very cool. Has value as a nifty clock/calendar even if you don't hook it to your phone line (though I have). I've often considered getting another one for work just for the ""ooh, ahh"" effect--and I wouldn't use it as caller ID there. I also enjoy that its operation is so intuitive (I never have to get the instructions out).And yes, the motor is audible, but with just a bit of trial and error you can find a placement in which the noise is minimal."
2,Not a good buy,"The infoglobe catches your eye for sure on the outside. The problem is that it is noisy and is not the easiest thing to set up. I would not reccommend this product to anyone. It's worth about $15.00 bucks in my opinion, definitely not $50.00."
2,Novelty item - not worth the price,"Bought as gift - didn't realize there was no ""call-waiting"" ID and it takes too long to register new calls. Wish it wasn't too late to return it!"
2,Short-Lived,"We liked the globe, and it worked very well for a few months after installation. Then it started to replace certain letters and numbers in the caller ID, so the number and names aren't spelled correctly any more.Also, despite that the box claims it has a 100-year calendar, it reads the wrong date. It even reads that it's the year 2005, not 2009. We've tried resetting the machine and changing the batteries, but this hasn't helped at all.It's a shame, really. We liked the design and the concept of the Infoglobe. It was useful for a limited time. Now it's more of an expensive guessing game when someone calls."
5,Info Globe,"The Info Globe is terrific. It ""announces"" Caller-ID calls in easy to read 1"" plus type. When not ""announcing"" calls, it acts as a clock and calendar. I own three and recently purchased two more at the request of neighbors."
1,Sudden Death,"Works pretty much as advertised, until it suddenly died about six months after purchase. Programming requires a rather counter-intuitive series of button clicks. Noisy. Basically, it was a fun little toy that I would not have bothered reviewing had it not cost so much and worked so poorly."
5,Taking Caller ID to a new level,This Gadget is amazing. It is the talk of the house when company is over. Great features and easy to use. Only thing I would change is if the motor was a little quieter. Very brigh light and easy to read and program. Great Caller ID
5,"Love it, But need the instructions!","I recieved this as a gift, and I think it is really cool! Only one problem, there were no instructions. So I don't know how to program everything. If anyone has the instructions please email me a copy. (LHSCheerBabe2008@yahoo.com) Thanks!"
3,used product that didn't work more than a day,Not happy at the moment. globe buttons didn't work. had to push and push and push to get anything to change then it stopped working...then it came back on and displayed ?????????????? then C9 C9 C9 then stopped again. Cost me $10 to send it back to niagra so they can decide if something is wrong with it...still waiting for a reply....;((
1,Doesn't work for long,"Got this as a X-mas gift. It worked for about 3 months then died with an ""EPROM error"". Look for something more durable."
3,"Excellent concept , Could be a real winner but....","09-11-06 update: This unit will reset its internal time to the phone company Caller ID time. That was causing the time change and not the unit itself.Previous reviewThe only ""bad"" thing I can say about it is (at least mine) looses nearly two minutes a day. The noise and vibration are ok... except for the fact that this design approach will eventually fail, electro-mechanical devices like this always do. 50 bucks is a little pricy for something that may last a year according to others.I don't see others talking about the time inaccuracy so I will give a replacement another shot. I do see a LARGE number of ""refurbished"" units for sale elsewhere, looks like quite a large number of returns... oh well, the price of being into cool looking stuff like this."
1,Beware if it breaks......,"I purchased the 3000 Infoglobe Dec. 2004. It worked great, and we were really enjoyed it....but Oct 24 2005, it stopped working. I have been trying to return the unit( still under warranty), and keep getting a run around. Something about warehouse moving????? Any way, it is 1-5-06, and I am still getting the run around. If it breaks...you might as well forget the warranty."
5,True guide to fitness,"I think Steve's book is great and provides an excellent insight to real natural bodybuilding. The methods are basic and simple. Too much of today's fitness and workouts are ""scientific"" and overdone. Stick with the basics like Steve preaches and you can get a great healthy physique!"
3,Just ok,"I am an older lifter and Steve was an idol of mine in my youth. I really do not think that the work out presented in the book is what Steve really did to build his physique, but rather, a program based up on the old 3 sets of 10 with a lot of exercises. Buy it if you are a fan and like looking at pictures of Steve for inspiration...there are far better training books out there."
3,"Good 1940's information, may be outdated","I like the idea of working out 3x aweek. Working out 2.5 hours each time is 2 too much. I do appreciate his approach to being natural and little anecdotes that make the book come to life. If you like Steve Reeves or if you want a simple plan with no confusion, this is the book for you. If you are looking for a secret you wont fing it here."
5,Definitely One of a Kind,"Interested in knowing a lot about the living legend SteveReeves? Please enter. If you're into bodybuilding, all the rightstuff for building a classic physique is here; how and when to work out, what to eat, what not to eat, when to rest, etc.; every ingredient for achieving a great build naturally. In addition to bodybuilding, Steve also unveils his everyday recipe for staying physically fit for life. Some of the topics include the power of walking, the importance of water, getting smart about nutrition, etc. With 175 rare pictures of Reeves, the book also delivers on biographical data: from childhood, to bodybuilding fame, to worldwide movie star, to Reeves' current activity. It's all documented, it's all interesting and it's all the write stuff."
4,edgy and brilliant,"A brilliant finish to the Jenny trilogy, and definitely my favorite out of all three. Elizabeth Bear shines during action scenes where she grips the reader with intense action and immediacy. The science and technology woven into this are intriguing and really absorbed me. From start to finish she created a wonderful tale. The characters are deep and complex.I will admit that the jumpy POVs are hard to get used to to begin with, and some will find her style of writing hard to digest. Also, there were points where I grew impatient with the slow sense of deliberation in everything, but those were few and far between.Worst part: The static pace towards the middle of the book.Best part: fight scenes (particularly between the AIs) and explanations of alien technology"
4,A Satisfying Conclusion to a Good Series,"Although (luckily for us) there appears to be plenty of room for sequels, Ms. Bear brings a nice wrap to an essentially self-contained arc of what feels like a much larger story. Although (speaking as a male reader) some--not all--of the male characters seemed a bit flat, the star of the show, Jenny Casey, is one of the best and deepest female heroines I have come across in ages. This is good, character-centered writing, and it's good sf, with a sense of scope and scale that push the genre forward, without requiring too great a suspension of disbelief.I liked all three of these (HAMMERED and SCARDOWN are the previous novels in the series), and look forward to reading more from Elizabeth Bear."
3,loved the product,came in just in time for me to do the cake i wanted for a friend. so glad i did a nine inch cake cause it was barley enough for it to fit. wish it was a smaller shoe.
5,Number One Jazz Piano Man,I was a latecomer to the great Hines. He rapidly became for me the greatest of all the jazz pianists.
4,"AN AFFIRMATION OF LIFE, SINGLE OR NOT","I am married. I was, however, single for 36 years. Being married is great as was being single. This book is an affirmation of LIFE, however you live it, i.e., the concept of being the best person you can possibly be. This book reminds us that this is the ongoing universal desire. The bottom line is you are out there. Alone. Even if you are in a relationship. The messages in this book are so important to not lose sight of, no matter one's status. It is written with wit, lightheartedness, sensitivity and sincerity. I have made a gift of it to my favorite people. It has been received with smiles of relief & is proudly displayed on the coffee table. Read it. Share it. I especially appreciated the references to the idea that at some point we are all single in this life. Such an obvious notion yet it gets lost in the muck. The book reminds us that we cope first as an individual. Deal with that before you try to be a partner. Thank you for the poignant messages."
1,Save your money,"Ridiculous, unfunny, dumb -- you name it. This is a terrible book. If I had been able to even thumb through it (rather than just rely on other reviews here) I would have immediately put it down. Full of the most obvious conventional wisdom (Married people can be miserable! Work on yourself! Take a class! Buy a pet!). It took me an hour to read its 125 pages (designed with lots of blank spaces and ENORMOUS fonts). And the co-author who is a ""doctor"" is actually an ER doctor according to the bio, not a psychiatrist (as you might think). The other author is a massage therapist. There are LOTS of better books about the single life and its ups and downs. Caveat emptor."
2,Editorial quality,"The information in this book is edifying, but for an educated reader it can be tough going. I find it painful to read a book where the publisher has not invested the energy to make sure that apostrophes are placed correctly. The text of this book is sadly about on the level or many greengrocers' signs, repeating in published print common errors that I distinctly recall having addressed in middle school.In an apparent attempt to cover for his low state of literacy, the author has tried for an ""educated"" sound, replacing every instance of the word ""in"" with the word ""within"". He invents words like ""asperse"". Often, I can not tell what a given sentence means after several analytic readings.I would stress, however, that this should not reflect poorly on the author, who is clearly not an academic. It should reflect brutally on the reputation of his publisher for not taking editorial responsibility."
2,Beauthiful ilustrations and disapointing card stories,"This is my second deck afeter purchasing ""Oracle of the Dreamtime"" which is an incredible deck!. The Druid Animal Oracle has very beautiful cards and poor stories and imaginery backing them. For me this is an important issue since a beautiful story behind a card helps you figuring out what's going on in your life!Do yourself a favor and avoid this deck. I should strongly recomend ""Oracle of the Dreamtime"""
4,Love it!,"I got this as a gift off of my wish list. Just as pretty as the Hidalgo version, MUCH less expensive! I love it, even though it's just a tiny bit too big."
3,Very Educational,"It's a beautiful book with big colorful illustrations. My 3 year old doesn't like to ""read"" the book because the text is a little boring. It's more educational for the adults. A nice book, but not my first choice for a young child."
2,He is better reporting a story then making one up,"Sometimes I wonder if the professional review organizations give every book such great review? I had some high hopes for this book as I have read some of his non-fiction work. I came away from the reading a bit disappointed. The story was inventive, but the cast of characters were a little to stereotypical and not very well developed. As the book unfolds the story that interested me from the dust jacket started to get a little unbelievable with his writing, I just kept saying ""No Way"". With the combination of the lackluster characters and the increasingly unbelievable story I lost interest at the end of the book. I simply finished it becuase I had put the time into it. I would stick to this authors non-fiction works"
5,Merchant 101,"Being a retailer, this is one of the best introductory retail books that I have read. Utilizing examples and easy to understand terminology, this is an excellent training guide."
3,you get what you pay for,"Although they did work, just not very strong at doing it. While attempting to hold two wires together, I actually bent the device while atempting to lock."
3,"Prestige is the name, not the quality","Product was not as I expected. It's not a precision hemostat, pieces are loose, it has a lot of areas where it was ground with a coarse grinding wheel, tip of clamp is only area that secures properly, insufficient for paper items, its just okay."
5,Great tool,"I bought this tool to use as an alternative to pliers for harder to reach occasions or when I want to lock my grip on something. The forceps open and close freely, and its locking mechanism makes it easy to use when gripping things. Looks shiny and brand new, and the metal used appears to be of good quality."
5,"Buy it, it will change you !!!!","I had watched it on PBS and immediately ordered it. The documentary changed my view of spirituality. It has changed my opinion about life, about enlightenment and about purpose of life as a whole. It is about Buddha but lot more about spiritually and self search. Buy it, it will change you!!!!!!"
5,NM Annie,This is an excellent overview of the Buddha's life and essential principles of Buddhism. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested either in the Buddha's life story or an introduction to some basic Buddhist principles.
4,Beautiful story!!,A story who's time has never been more appropriate. Buddha has been an inspiration of inner strength and contentment for centuries but in these times we should all embrace a bit of his energy. The true enlightenment both he and Jesus understood are truly worth learning about.
5,Buddha,A beautiful experience in the life of my master. If we all could treat one another just a fraction of how the buddhha lived we would surely make it in this world.
2,Sadly Lacking,"I am unhappy with what I've seen (perhaps mostly due to my studies). Although in a positive light, this presentation misses much of what Siddhartha Gautama was trying to convey. Likely, it is a simplification in order to address those of little patience. However, I believe many important aspects are unfortunately missing. For example...although modern Buddhism stems from Siddharta Gautama, he was not the only ""Buddha"". Furthermore, the simplification of dukkha (""suffering"", etc.) is lacking in much of what was trying to be conveyed. Although I am an Orthodox Christian, I sincerely respect that which ""the"" Buddha was trying to teach. If you truly want to understand the teachings of Buddha without having to read the various sutras (discourses, scriptures), I recommend listening to the very open and non-biased (at least in my opinion) discussions led by Joseph Goldstein. No need to buy anything from him, as all of his discussions are free on his (and other) websites."
3,Quite good,"Certainly a very accessible discourse on the life of Shakyamuni Buddha, and of course the narration was by Gere was wonderful. I found the animation at best, little unsophisticated, and at worst a little irritating. Perhaps a dramatization may have been a little more effective. Bob Thurman and His Holiness provided accurate and thoughtful commentaries. If this were the limit of commentary, I rather think that would have been sufficient. As for the balance of the 'talking heads' - they could have easily been sent to the cutting room floor in my view. Look generally good, but not as good as expected."
2,Yankee Buddhism,"Spiritual materialism. Easily digestible introduction to Buddhism but don't be fooled into thinking the path is easy. Interviews from experts who supposedly understand the path of the buddha. The DL is humble and makes sense. Buddhism in the USA though is just another identity garb to be worn in an attempt to find something meaningful in a culture that is devoid of it. Its a facade and none of it is real. Its a protection against guilt, loneliness and emptiness. Frightening stuff but those subjects are of course not covered here."
1,Buddha was Born in Nepal not in northern India,I couldn't believe the knowledge of film maker. He is wrong right front. Buddha was born in Nepal and the place called Lumbini if he doesn't know. I hope he is going to correct that ASAP.
3,Focus on the Buddha and not on the Buddhists,"I rented this movie on iTunes and streamed it via AppleTV. I was looking forward to it. Having watched it, I have to say I was disappointed by the commentary from many of the Buddhists. Many of the people interviewed for the documentary know much about the Buddha, but do not know Buddha. The documentary was at its finest when the Buddha was speaking. I recommend this film to those earnestly seeking the Spirit. For those who do buy it or watch it, I would urge you to focus on the words of the Buddha and not the Buddhist commentators. There is great Light in Buddha. Great Light!"
1,NOT THAT GOOD,EVEN FOR A LAYMEN LIKE ME IT WAS TOO SIMPLIFIED AND DID NOT TELL A GOOD STORY. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO THE BEGINNER OR THE EXPERIENCED BUDHIST. THE ANIMATION WAS THE WORST. AFTER I WATCHED THIS I DID NOT FEEL ANY MORE ENLIGHTENED AND EVEN FELT LIKE I JUST WASTED 2 HRS OF MY TIME.
3,Books in this series are very similar,This was the second book I read in this series and the information at the beginning is mildly breed specific. However the rest is just a rehash of general information. If you are not familiar with dogs it's a decent book and if you are looking for detailed information on cane coro's this probably isnt it.
5,a good read for Cane owners,We have a Cane that we rescued and there is hardly any reading material on this breed. They are exceptional athletes and great companions. I really enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to other Cane Corso owners or people are thinking about owning a Cane Corso
4,Very Helpful,This is a somewhat unheard of breed and this was one of very few books I could find that even mentioned the breed. Everything I needed to know.
4,Cane Corso (Kane Korso),This is the most up-to-date and fully informative book about the breed I could find in English. A must have for new Cane Corso owners. Even experienced breeders should get something out of it.
5,Buying a Corso?,"The quintessential guide to the Cane Corso, a serious dog requires a serious book and serious thought. This book delivers in all areas! If you are going to invest some real dollars into a purebred Corso be informed be wise read this book. I will be referencing this book for months - years to come, the best instruction manual for your new best friend! I would also supplement this book with books on BARF diet so you can give it your best."
2,Wouldn't recommend this,"This product fits the nexus well. However, if you are trying to fit a screen protector in addition to the case, it doesn't work. The screen protector doesn't fit well under the case and consequently is lifted up at the edges. I wouldn't recommend this product."
5,"Nice, light cover","just got it and i love it. it is form fitting, lite, non-slip and comfortable to hold. feels like good quality materials. ports are easily accessible. buttons are covered but they don't interfere with function."
2,if you thought this generic label sleeve would protect your device Nexus 7 you made the same mistake I did,"texture is actually with less grip than the device housings itself, might be a millimeter thick even, no worthwhile design on sleeve like I said generic, no real value. For the price of a 40-70 dollar protective sleeve you may as well have just bought the Amazon accident insurance plan"
3,Separates from the sides easily.,"This case is textured nicely, and does wrap around the side enough to protect the edges of the Nexus, and also is fairly lightweight. The only thing I don't care for is, given the case is soft and flexible, the edges of it pull away easily from the sides, top and bottom of the tablet when you are holding it. It would be nicer if it gripped the edges of the Nexus more. But overall, glad I have the protection."
3,"Great, but not for kid protection","We thought the case was great, but had to return it because we needed more protection for kids. If fit perfectly though!"
4,Very good 'bumper style' case.,A very lightweight and thin case. Very good fit while still easy to remove from the case. The texture on the back improves grip and I have the feeling that the Nexus is well protected.
5,A rubber by any other name is for your Nexus 7,"Boxwaves BodySuit Premium Textired TPU Rubber Gel Skin is a case for a Google Nexus 7. And not any kind of sex toy. It fits firm the tight,and has holes for all the right buttons. It comes in a dark sexy black. This aid allows one to control your Nexus with one hand ,while surfing the world wide web. A gel form protecting your Nexus from the bump and grind. And not a sex toy. Oh my!!!"
2,As thin as can be! Definitely NOT for bumps or drops!,The BoxWave Body Suit is not protection against anything other than scraps and scratches. I think this was manufactured as thin as they could make it. It will not offer any protection against bumps or drop. I have an Amazon Basics gel case for the iPod Touch and another brand Gel Case for the original iPad that are thicker in design that offer protection from bumps.
5,Good Product,Worked perfectly. Holds on tightly to the Nexus and keeps the screen from touching table tops when it is face down.
1,Really? Seriously?,"Yeah, the candy is good, but do we really need to add a zillion teeny tiny candy wrappers to our landfills? Buy these in a box instead and recycle it, your grandchildren will thank you."
3,Good book but lacks,"This book was good, had alot of pics. But at some parts of the book they had news paper clippings that were not compleat. I.E. One part is an interview with Passenger of the Fatel Crash. Half way into the interview, it cuts off. All and all a pretty good book if you like pics."
2,"A Poor Gentleman, indeed","The Duke wrote this self serving biography while serving his exile as a result of his traitorist behavior. A Nazi sympathizer, the Duke referred to Australians and the people of the Bahamas who he was ""serving"" as Governor as monkeys. He admits to affairs with married women, perhaps to justify his own wife's adultery? While we all have our destiny, some of us manage to improve the lot of others while some of us are simply parasites. Edward, the Duke of Windsor was a parasite. What is amusing is that he reveals as such in his own biography. Better for England that he gave up the throne."
5,Winnie the Pooh - 31 Wall Stickers,"bright, good quality restickable wall stickers really made the baby's room look so muh nicer, and can be moved around if we move the furniture. good value"
2,"Decent buy but NOT reusable,as described!","These appliques made the nursery look absolutely awesome- in the beginning. About 4 months after I put them up, they started peeling off the walls, and they are not reusable as the description says! I have followed all the directions and now half of them are in the trash! If you're looking for something temporary, go for it, but I was wanting something to last at least a couple of years. My review in the beginning have it 5 stars because the room looked awesome. Now, I give it 2 stars because they barely lasted 6 months!"
3,Get it right the first time,"These stickers are beautiful and great but especially some of the larger pieces, if it sticks to the wall slightly accidentally, it easily tears when taking it off. Any bubbles that form up combined with its easy to rip when picking it off the wall to smooth out makes it a bit frustrating. Fortunately the tears are smooth and the colors are vibrant so it is possible to lineup the tears fairly easily to make it difficult to notice."
4,Great addition to baby's room,The color is very vivid. It looks like the stickers have been painted on the warm. Everything has stayed on the wall so far.
3,Item received was not what I ordered.,"I ordered a metal, floppy-drive adapter bracket and received a plastic one instead.I needed a metal bracket to help dissipate the heat. The plastic one works, but I am concerned that over time I will have to replace it because it will not be able to draw heat away from the device."
4,I hate most pillows but......,This is one sweet pillow and it supports my head just right. I highly recommend it to anyone who sleeps on their side.
3,I suprisingly very happy,"Was wanting the pillow to be much firmer, but they are wonderful and I am very happy with the purchase. Wish there was choice of king/queen but very nice indeed..."
4,"Energetic, but flowing and organic","I was impressed by this CD, and I play it over and over. It flows well, and is kind of halfway between Pressurehed, mid-period Hawkwind, and Anubian Lights. Which makes sense given the band's pedigree. Recommended!"
2,Farflung Falls,"I generally love Farflung but The Belief Module presses a lot of wrong buttons for me. Here the group tries a misguided marriage of space rock, stoner rock and freaky psychedelia, without much success, I might add. I fully understand why some Farflungers really dig this album; however, if you're looking for another 25,000 Feet per Second, The Belief Module will leave you quite disappointed."
3,Faulty Hard Drives,"On paper, this sounds like a great MP3 player. It has the storage, 6 GB, to last me for many years. Problem is,this is my 2nd Nomad and I'm hesitant to get a 3rd.The hard drive in units 1 & 2 went bad, causing lockups that only removing the batteries could resolve. While downloading music to the Nomad, the unit would freeze up and the software would give me an error message telling me the unit was busy or unavailable. This happened every session. During playback, the unit would freeze up and not continue the playlist. I couldn't turn the unit off, I had to remove the batteries to shut it down. Nomads' Tech Service advised that my problem was hard drives with bad sectors. I can forgive one bad unit, but nottwo. At this time I can't recommend the Nomad Juke Box until they address the hard drive issue.I've never realized the problem free service that I'd hoped forwith this unit"
4,Only Downfall is the size,"The Creative Labs MP3 player is great. The screen is very easy to understand and is great for organizing music. I bought both the Archos and the Creative labs MP3 player and it out performs the Archos player in so many ways. The archos is very small, that is the only thign it has goin for it. The screen is terrible and you can't group music into artists. The creative labs even though it has a short battery life it still is worth the money. They also give you a second set of batteries."
4,Good...maybe too good,"I have one of these and it's great to go hours and hours on random play without hearing the same song twice. However, it's sometimes difficult to find a specific song that I want to hear or set it up so that it plays one album from start to finish. One problem is that the more songs in storage the slower the machine works. Another problem is that the operating system and the computer software are buggy although Creative does produce upgrades and patches for both of those. Having said all that, it's really great for travelling, background noise or whatever."
3,Stock up on batteries,"As advertised the NOMAD is a great player. It works well with headphones, in the car (with an adapter) or with speakers. Unfortunately, the NiMH batteries supplied are awful. The first charge, according to the directions, is 12 hours. I charged both sets and it worked great, playing for almost 2 hours on a single charge. The next 4 charges failed to give me more than 10 minutes play time. When the company was contacted they never answered my questions or letters. My recommendation is to but ALOT of AA batteries or get a power inverter for your car to run it off the plug in adapter."
2,Not a good buy...,"If you're looking for a scholarly work on the life of Paganini, don't buy this book; it's nothing more than a regurgitation of information and quotes from other articles and biographies on Paganini. The author fails to properly quote all of his sources and frequently interjects his own tedious opinions, which I found to be trite and irrelevant."
2,Same book with different name,"While the book is fairly well written and offers some insight into Paganini's life, it is simply a previously published book (""Niccolo Paganini: Supreme Violinist or Devil's Fiddler"") now pubished under a different title. Since there seems to be a dearth of material on Paganini, this makes it even more disappointing."
2,Not very well organized,"I had bought this book over 20 years ago, and finally had the time to sit down to read it from cover to cover.Sugden included a lot of photographs, maps, and manuscripts, which made the book visually pleasing. Reading the text was a nightmare, however. Each chapter went from start to finish without any break. His tendency to either go off tangent or assert his own opinions also made it very difficult to follow.The book itself was not very well organized either. Details pertinent to Paganini's early career were not mentioned until in the chapter concerning his death. Other trivial information (such as LeRoy's Miracle Cure) was mentioned ad nauseam.If one had the patience and persistence to put up with this seemingly random pile of text, it could be informative, and provided additional insights to the life of Paganini beyond his obvious musical accomplishments."
1,Very disappointing,"Some things cannot be improved upon. Unfortunately, Creatures is one of them. The original game was brilliant and fun, but each new version and expansion is worse than the previous one, with this one being boring and unplayable. I was a huge fan, and this is a huge disappointment.Warning - Half of this game is completely inaccessible since the company's server no longer exists. So you will be able to play the basic game but not the Exodus part."
4,The revenge starts here.,"This is the play which first introduced to the Elizabethean audience the sub-genre of the revenge play. It was in fact so popular, that it was soon immitated. The play is a typical renaissance play, and so it has both main plot, and sub-plot. Both of these deal with revenge, and the character of revenge is actually present on the stage. It is very inventive play, and should be a required reading for anyone seriously studying Elizabethean theater, as it provides context, and most likely inspiration for the better known plays of Shakespeare. Thomas Kyd happened upon a formula with this play, which was emulated until the closing of the theaters some 40 years later. This play started a trend, which is still going strong today, as revenge is a powerfull, and popular topic, which transcends time."
5,Must have for all your cooking.,I love this seasoning. I am waiting for my second order to arrive so that I can share it with friends and family over the holidays. It is so good on all cuts of meat. It is the best on roasts and chicken. Must try.
5,Buy a few jars!,"This stuff is the best! I have a difficult time finding it in grocery stores.. So I always buy a few jars at a time, and have been known to give them as gifts to my meat loving friends. There is nothing better than a rib eye steak seasoned with this and cooked on a nice hot grill. Unless if course you add a glass of Malbec."
2,Disappointed with this product.,I have used many different commercial and homemade rubs and this was a disappointment. Had dinner with friends who used a Snider rub; thought I was ordering the same item. Tried it tonight for a steak on a grill. Not satisfied.
1,doesn't work properly,"When moving the variable lever to a higher magnification setting, every thing goes out of alignment and out of focus."
4,Good quality & fun,We got this for our two year old last X-mas and my husband was able to put together all the blocks by himself in less than an hour. They're very durable and lots of fun for all of us. I build a tower and Taylor loves knocking it down
2,"CHEAP CARDBORD ""BLOCKS"" A RIP-OFF","My grandaughter wanted these large ""blocks"" so I purchased them for Christmas. They come in flat cardboard forms that have to be put together ( a real PIA). They do not square up and aren't worth anything near the $42.00 I paid for them. Save your money!!"
4,great fun!!,my daughter loves building to crash the walls down LOLher day and i have fun with them too comimg up with new designs
2,Dissatisfied,The boxes have to be put together which is time consuming and hard to figure out even with instructions. They are too lite and when stacking they are wobbly and fall down.
2,plant markers?,"They don't last too long and the label print fades quickly. In addition, squirrel likes to chew on them and move them around......"
1,"Poor design, handles fall off, sharp edges can cut hands!","I do not share the excitement from the other review. The both green handle covers slide off the tool when it is being used. Astonishing, that someone would put out for sell such a poorly crafted tool. When the handle slide off, either the tool or the handle falls into the greenery. The both handles were punched from a sheet metal and in my case have had such sharp edges that I cut my hand. I filed them off to prevent that from happening again.A smaller issue is that the adjustment screw cannot be held in place, and it hits the opposite handle under a wrong angle.Workaround: Use silicon or ""grab it"" type of gel to attach the handles in a more permanent fashion to the pliers."
5,"Warm, inviting watercolors and lovingly detailed text","This ""fish out of water"" story concludes with the timeless moral that each of us should be content with our lot in life. Country mouse Tilly invites her city friend to visit, and then town mouse Milly reciprocates. Though they both enjoy each other's company, they part with a new respect for their own place in life.Kneen's warm, inviting watercolors of the English countryside perfectly set off the lovingly detailed text. Summers seems to have the knack for exposition without going overboard. From the description of Tilly doing her sweeping, cleaning and other ""mousework"" to the detailed tour of the rooms in Milly's well-furnished townhouse, this book keeps children engrossed from beginning to end."
3,"Cute story, cute idea, darling pictures! A little missing...","This story compares the lives of a country mouse and a city mouse, as each mouse goes to visit her friend at her home. It's a cute idea, showing the differences and what each mouse likes about her home. However, I felt the ending was a little lackluster...SPOILERWhile I'm totally fine with each mouse still preferring her home (country or city) after visiting the other, I thought the ending was rushed and somewhat unsatisfactory as neither mouse really tries to understand the other's home and why they would like it so much. I suppose there is a little of that, but I didn't feel there was enough resolution. Also, it kind of gave the impression that their homes and fears were a little more important than their friendships (it doesn't say this - but it doesn't say otherwise either...)It's still very cute, but it could have been better."
4,Compares different amish groups,My favorite thing about this book is that it includes several charts which compare what different technologies various Amish groups allow. I've read many books on the plain people and this is the first comparison I've seen.
3,Rube Goldberg lovers will enjoy it,"I had no idea how many exotic ways existed to avoid a couple simple technologies. The book is a quick entertaining read, but will leave most people rolling their eyes at the seemingly absurd lengths some will go to to avoid a couple little copper wires. I understand the desire to maintain community and applaud it. But using batteries and taking them to a neighbor to recharge is just silly, IMHO. And, if anyone thinks that the religious groups who avoid certain aspects of the modern world are self sufficient, read this. They certainly are not. They are highly dependent on the oil industry to keep their air compressors going and their lights on to mention just a couple things."
2,it is fine if you want to read about amish country ....,...but useless from the point of view of everyday tips on how to make up for power during a blackout.
5,Great Map!,"This map is a must have for the serious battlefield walker, locating all the monuments, buildings, trails and roads within the park. This is in addition to being a quality contour map designed for outdoors use. The contour map is important here and allows you to understand how some areas sheltered troops during the attacks. Kennesaw has a number of trails that can be confusing and the map is helpful in this area. It is a great souvenir and cam be used as a general map when reading about the battle."
5,Correct item,Item was exact part ordered. The pps system is a great system and saves from using unnecessary materials. You can also turn your gun upside down while spraying and don't have to worry about paint dripping out.
2,Postage 4 x the price.,this is just what I have been looking for . My God the price of postage 4 x the item! to post to Borneo malaysia.
4,"The best version of ""War Pigs"" I've ever heard.","You simply haven't heard ""War Pigs"" until you've heard ""War Pigs"" performed on the trombone."
3,at least one damn good song!,"The king song on this album though, is Rise to the Skin (track one), a most perfect song and one of their best!!All the songs on here are worth a listen for some of what they say, and funny too... but most of the songs, after a while, you don't need to hear them anymore (other notable tracks on this are 4, 'What?' -totally good, and track 2, My Best Friends Wife)."
4,Very Good,"This album has enough high points to even out the rough spots. I'll easily agree with earlier suggestions to buy ""Donut Comes Alive"" first and foremost, but this isn't nearly bad enough compared to say, NSYNC to not give 4 stars. It doesn't reach perfection, but it is very satisfying to listen to. I really like their chatty spoken-word horror story tunes and wish they would've done one (at least) on all their albums."
2,a weak album,"This fourth LP by Alice Donut is the weakest among their body of work. It sounds a lot like the band just slapped together the songs that were too bad or out of place to be included on previous LPs and put them all out on the same disk. While not terrible, it is pretty forgettable compared to the band's previous work.If you are new to Donut, skip this album entirely. ""Donut Comes Alive,"" ""Bucketfulls of Sickness and Horror,"" and ""Mule"" are far superior."
5,"Wonderful, but...","Their likeness to the Beatles may be what's keeping them from being more well known. They find inspiration in other bands, such as Pink Floyd, as another reviewer said, but the prevalent influence on these guys is definitely the legendary band from Liverpool that we all know and love.These guys write great music, and there isn't a song that is bad (not even the more experimental ones, and there is quite a bit of experimentation on this) but no one wants to listen to someone that they know is a copy of someone else. If these guys gave their sound a little variety, they could be the biggest band in the world. Until then, they'll be ""those guys that sound like the Beatles""."
1,Don't buy this pan,"The instructions say to wash before use, and that it is dishwasher safe. After only one run in the dishwasher both pieces were rusted! I had not even used it yet. It is badly rusted, and The Wire Whisk is not a comapny I will deal with in the future. They said they will ""be inspecting the pan when they get it back"" and based on that only then will they refund my money. Don't buy this pan, I found a much nicer one at Walmart yesterday for only five dollars by Wilton."
2,Made in China,"I thought that all Chicago Metallic products were made in the USA. This pan was Made in China. Perhaps the pan will still perform well, but I would have not purchased had I known this in advance. Just my humble opinion."
5,I heard this guy on the radio he is right on!!,"I woke up this morning hearing about this book in a radio interview. He has nailed it! As a 25 year old in my fourth year of marriage i can say sex is certainly vital and knowing that things will change when you marry is too! The bottom line is everything changes, if you think it, you, or he won't..then never marrry because as he says...it will!"
1,Too simple,"I read this book with some interest, and I conclude the author makes some good evolutionary points, but the question remains in my mind: do women really need a man to make them happy? Happiness comes from many different sources, and it is unrealistic to think that, even with the ""sex for flowers"" trade, a woman can get all of her emotional and/or instinctual needs met just from sex and marriage. No one person can fulfill all of anothers' emotional needs."
1,The real reason,Women have always withheld sex and used it as a weapon to get what they want. The real reason women initiate 91% of divorces is because they get everything they did not earn! DUh.
1,Utter trash,"Blatant sexism written by a clearly bitter multiple-divorcee who wants to blame the women in his life for his own problems.Reading this book makes it painfully obvious that the author has severe emotional issues, and should frankly be seeking relationship therapy instead of trying to blame an entire gender for his personal faults.This hacked-together opinion piece is based 100% on personal opinion. You will find no bibliography, notes or index, because there are no facts to reference. All the numbers and information used in this piece are essentially pulled out of a hat and have no relation to what happens in the real world."
1,Bf 109F/G/K Aces of the Western Front,Do not buy this book. You will want it to be over before you get started. Not a fun book to read.
3,I think Korine is getting bored.,"I was really excited for this movie when I heard rumors about it coming out. Then I watched it. It just fell flat. Not utterly terrible, but just not that great. There are the expected funny/surreal moments, but not enough to improve the overall mediocrity of this flick."
4,Church of Misery - 'Taste The Pain' (Bad Acid),"Another good release from the short-lived UK indie label, Bad Acid. 'Taste The Pain' is a four (4) track mini-lp from the Japanese band, that according to their bio sheet, has perfected their style of playing psychedelic doom. I dug the title cut, ""Taste The Pain"" and their heavy cover of Iron Butterfly's ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" the best. Each song here is painfully dedicated to serial killers of our time. For example, ""Plainfield"" is about Ed Gein. Isn't he the one that the media had done a pretty good job of keeping his killings quiet, for at least several years? Pretty decent,for an EP. Check it out when you get the chance."
5,Exactly what you think it should be,I use this to reduce the vibration input when using slow film and not wanting to use the self timer. Works great on my Nikon N80 and my antiquated D100. Smooth actuation and people think you know what you are doing when you have gadgets that they don't. :)
3,Dramatic Regency,"Georgina Devon has placed the story in the Regency time period but I personally found it a little too dramatic with emotions running high. The hero is still coming to terms with the battles he saw in Spain etc,From the dust cover of the Mills & Boon edition...Lizabeth Johnstone was stunned by Lord Alastair St Simon, and shocked by her reaction to him. He was the embodiment of every woman's dream, but he wasn't hers, for Alastair was responsible for the death of her younger brother. Alastair wanted to help Liza, but her refusal to accept his aid left him with no alternative - they'd have to get married..."
5,great for emergency,"after losing power for 12 hours I was anxious to make sure my emergency supplies were a little more up to date, this is great. The littler one seems almost brighter, but is probably just easier to wind and charge up. Great product!"
5,Good Product,I am happy with my product. I ordered this book for a class and I plan to use it a lot during the next few months.
3,Really just about OK.,"Let's be clear about one thing. It is a page-turner and it does have plot twists that are real doozies. That being said, the forensics parts are really weak. Oooh he has a gas chromatograph! Wheee! As the late Professor Richard Feynmann said, ""if you just know the name of something, you know nothing about it"". That's the impression I got here - Mr Deaver knows the names of things, but not how to use them. The deductions of Rhymes are often outrageous - with so many possible alternatives, he can always pick the right one. The equipment at Rhymes' disposal give way too rapid analyses and results. But of course, such things are needed if you only have 48 hours to the Grand Jury. Dah-dah-dah-daaah!The relationship between Rhymes and Sachs is I think quite well handled. The ""relationship"" between Rhymes and Ms Trilling is frankly ludicrous."
2,Not his best,"I was very disappointed with this effort. Deaver did not develop the characters well at all. The wife of the pilot blown up in the beginning exhibited very little sorrow at her loss, although Deaver made a weak attempt to cover the issue later.I also find it very hard to believe all the drinking Pearce did before flying the Lear. The book picked up, but way too late."
4,The Coffin Dancer keeps the reader slipping and stumbling,I found the Coffin Dancer to be a refreshing forensic based murder mystery and thriller. The plots and subplots were well thought out and the technical information that was referenced was fascinating (I would like to know how much of it is actually real).Just as I thought that I figured out what was going to happen at the end the music changed and the stumbling began.Deaver was quite good on how he would get the reader into the killers mind to feel his sickness but also to admire his geniusThe characters for the most part were well developed though some of the characteristics of the main players may have been developed in Deavers' first Lincoln Rhyme Novel.I have always enjoyed series novels such as those of Patricia Cornwell and James Patterson. Hopefully this series will continue.I highly recommend this novel for anyone interested in forensic type murder mysteries.
5,Good book,We have always enjoyed Jeffery Deaver and I think we have read all the Lincoln Rhyme novels. I wish they would come out even faster. I would recommend this book to all Deaver fans and to anyone looking for a new mystery writer to follow.
5,"One of the best, most enthralling books I've ever read.","The character of Lincoln Rhyme first grabs both the attention and the pity of the reader; however, the pity portion is only short lived. Rhyme proves to be a true genius and master of his field when it comes to forensic science and intuition. Deaver does an excellent job in educating the reader in the more techincal forensic terminology but does so in a fasion that does not seem ""textbookish"". This novel is a definite page turner from the getgo and keeps your interest with a series of unexpected plot twists. Deaver takes the reader along for the ride of a dangerous game of a cat and mouse that leaves you open-mouthed as the killer finally is revealed! A definite must read!"
5,This is a natural page turner!!!,"This is a gripping story. It is not pridectable. I imagined three way for it to end and I was wrong all three times! The story takes on many turns, turns one cannot pridect! Beautifully composed."
5,AWESOME BOOK!!,This was the first book by Jeffery Deaver I ever read. And may I say it was GREAT! Just the way he gets into the minds of all the charactors and expalins things in such deep detail amazes me. This is a great reading for anyone who love myster/thriller books!
5,could not put this page turner down,Rarely is one really affected by chracters in a book but Lincoln and Amelia are different as is The Coffin Dancer. Expect the unexpected and enjoy the plot twists and turns because rarely do you find thriller that is so well written and so absorbing. Plus- this is one ending that will blow you away. can't wait for the enxt installment featuring Lincoln and Amelia.
5,'The Coffin Dancer' by Jeffery Deaver,"The book follows Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs with their hunt for a serial killer known as the 'Coffin Dancer'. Rhyme uses his forensic knowledge and experience to get into the mind of a murderer. With Rhyme guiding her, Sachs is able to collect information and evidence that will eventually lead them to the killer. The book is full of surprises and has an excellent twist at the end. It keeps you really interested right from the start. It lets you heighten your imagination in many ways making it a brilliant read."
4,Worth the Struggle,"I really had to struggle getting through the first half of this book. I just didn't seem to care for any of the victims yet. After reaching the halfway point, I was rewarded nicely by situations that had me on the edge of my seat. So, if you're struggling too, hang in there. The book is worth it."
2,It's a bad sign...,"If the author must bring the hero and villain together at the end of the book to recap and explain the plot and ending, it's a sign that the body of the book is a confused mess. The book is agonizingly long. A waste of time."
3,An entertaining read-nothing more,"This is my second Deaver thriller, the first being the high tech thriller The Blue Beyond"", which I thought was much more clever than this. That book inspired me to read more of his books. This book is an entertaining thriller, with one great twist at the end, and one predictable twist which actually undermined the credibilty of the characters. It is far from a great book and the characters are not very deep; in fact just slightly more complex than your average TV mystery series."
3,Ehhh...an ok read.....but not developed as well as others,"I read the Bone Collector and was blown away by that book, so I thought I would read his second book...The Coffin Dancer....and while the book was gripping in various parts...I just could not buy into the whole bad guy character. Just a little to unbelievalbe in certain key moments in the book. Sometimes the second book can be the hardest book for a writer. I think Deavers just fell into that second book syndrom with this try.A fair book, but I would not read it again, and I am hesitant to recommend this book to other readers. I would actually give this a 2 1/2 star review if I could, but that being said, the book was just good enough for me to buy his third book...The Empty Chair...and I am looking forwarding to a good read...I know this guy is a talented writer so I will certainly give him a second chance!!!"
4,Page Turner !,Some books are described as a page turner...but don't merit such a rating. This one does !! When a book is soooo good that I stay up into the night reading it...that's a good book. And that's exactly what I did with this one.
5,Amazing,"I can't describe how good this book is. About the time I thought I figured it out, it turned 180 degrees and hit me like a freight train before I knew what was going on. I recommend this book to anyone."
2,"Poor, simple-minded characters","The detective here, Rhyme, is such a crybaby. What's supposed to come off as his special 'brilliance' is actually bleeding freakin' obvious stuff. ""Wow, Lincoln,"" you'll say, ""You figured that all by yourself!"" You'll feel sorry for him and the other sorry characters. You'll gaze through ENORMOUS HOLES in the plot and see the starry sky. RECOMMENDED FOR THE WEAK-MINDED."
1,THIS BOOK IS DREADFUL!,"A lot of people seem to like this book-- and all I can say is, their standards must be way low. There is not a SINGLE CHARACTER MOMENT that WORKS in this book. The love interest isn't believable (and not because the hero is paralyzed. That isn't the problem). The Nemesis isn't believable-- none of the bad guys are. The interplay between the characters-- at no point did I buy a moment of it. I finished the book, yes, but mostly as a technical exercise. It has one good trick up its sleeve, but even the character motivations for that are not brilliantly constructed. And the forensic stuff is so arcane that only the brilliant hero can get it-- not regular readers like you and me. Hey, I love a good thriller. Unfortunately, this is not one. Kind of a shame, really-- all that intelligence, and not a decently conceived and executed character in the bunch."
1,Lousy,"If you know nothing about flying rest assured anything relating to aviation is total BS! There is nothing realistic about the flying related portions of this book, this includes the pilot characters. What a joke they are. All this wouldn't be so bad if the plot didn't revolve around flying and the main pilot character."
3,Well...It's alright,"This book moves at break-neck speed, but it sacrafices detail and character development in the process. The ""surprise ending"" was not so ""surprising"", since I felt like I really didn't know the Coffin Dancer or what made him kill, even in the end. Not a bad read."
4,Great!!!,I read all Deaver's previous books and those were terrific! But Coffin Dancer is the best so far! The ending was great! Had to stop and read some parts over to make sure that I didn't miss anything. I expect to see the Dancer again in his futuer Lincoln Rhyme books. The Bone Collector is being made into a movie starring Denzel Washington as Lincoln Rhyme and Angelique Jolie as Amelia Sachs. Can't wait to see it!
4,another great read from Deaver,"I really liked this book, however, it didn't grab me as fast as, let's say; The Empty Chair which is one of my favorites featuring Rhyme. Deaver is an all around great writer; I enjoy all his stories featuring Rhyme or his stand alone stories; my favorite happens to be The Blue Nowhere. I'm going to keep on reading his stories because there soo0000 damn addictive. Enjoy."
4,Excellent read,I have read almost all of the Lincoln Rhyme novels and thought that some of the endings where not up to the rest of the book. These are great fun reads and I love the antisipation of getting started on a new one. This time I was caught off guard. The book grabbed me right away and was hooked. Great twists and even the ones I saw coming ending up catching me off guard again later. Hands down the best of the Rhyme novels so far. Keep it up Mr. Deaver!
5,Wonderful thriller,"This was by far the best book I have read in years! I couldn't put it down. It kept me guessing at every turn and was so intriguing! This is the first Deaver novel I have read, and it will not be my last!"
5,Jeffrey Deaver's best to date.,"A well crafted mystery featuring Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs, teaming up once again to hunt the Coffin Dancer. An intricate plot with some surprising twists, and enough forensic science to satisfy the die-hard mystery buff. A great read."
3,"Good, Not Great Thriller","Wow, everyone else liked this book ALOT more than I did. It was good, but not great in my opinion. I'll say the twisted ending was REALLY good and unexpected. But I found the rest of the book kinda predictable. Also the bad guy is almost supernatural in his abilities. He manages to steal a fireman's uniform and break into an FBI safehouse faster than you can yell ""Fire"". Don't firemen lock their firehouses? There were a few other examples like this, that I felt really stretched believability and detracted from the story. For Mr. Deaver's next book, I'll wait for the paperback."
5,I loved this book and this author !!!,"I didn't think I could read a book I liked better than ""Bone Collector"", but this book was the greatest. I have made it a point to read everything Jeff Deaver has written and hope against hope that he's writing another Lincoln Rhyme book right now. I have enjoyed all of his books, but these two with Lincoln Rhyme as the main character are my absolute favorites. If you haven't read any of his books, be sure to read ""Bone Collector"" first and then ""Coffin Dancer"" next."
2,good plot twist at the end--but thats all,This book was annoying in many ways but the thing that bothered me the most was the Mrs. Clay did not even seem to care that her husband and friend were dead. All she cared about was... her airplane? It just seems really silly to me. I found myself cheering for the villians instead of the victims.
3,Why didn't Deaver continue the cliffhanger from The Bone Collector?!,"Am I the only person who's upset that Mr. Deaver ended The Bone Collector with a ""cliffhanger"", i.e. bomber, Carole Ganz (along with her young daughter, Pammy), blowing up the UN conference...and then NOTHING?I started The Coffin Dancer thinking that it would continue where The Bone Collector left off, so you can imagine my disappointment when I realized that nothing was going to be resolved at all.WTF?!Other than that, The Coffin Dancer was a good, stand-alone thriller that kept me guessing until the very end. I'm looking forward to reading The Empty Chair (Lincoln Rhyme #3).3 1/2 stars"
2,"Enjoyable, but not credible","1) The killer is unstoppable even by all the forces of the police and the FBI combined, and 2) The criminologist is a Sherlock holmes with none of the credibility of Holmes. To the point that the total lack of credibility ruins the novel for the reader."
2,A Time pass read,Though i am averse to fiction stuff yet i sometime fiddle with these when i am too saturated with reality. This novel really took me off to a non-real world and pace of the story never let its hook off me . I never felt like reading 500 pages . Though the theme was quite the same as other rhyme novels (lincoln chasing a ghost like criminal who leaves no trace)yet there are brief interesting interludes like gay feeling of coffin dancer for his accomplice or The seducing of Linclon by Sacks (which might be given more space in future novels) . Overall a return on investment though not a overthetop kinda stuff.
3,Nothing Special,"This was my debut for this author (I did see The Bone Collector on the big screen), but I was disappointed. I don't usually read this kind of book, but I did read Michael Connolly's The Poet and was freaked out enough to try another.Maybe it's just me, but The Coffin Dancer just wasn't scary or suspenseful (what's so scary about a contract killer who kills his victims with bombs in their airplanes anyway?). Half the book is written from the point-of-view of the killer, which takes away alot of the fear/intensity. And Rhyme is able to figure out everything, which also kills the mood. There are some plot twists, but they are unrealistic and somewhat obvious. The chapter on the plane when they discover the bomb is an exception-- that was good suspense."
2,unrealistic,"This book is way too unrealistic. As I read it, I constantly said to myself, ""Yeah right, sure."" Everything always turned out too perfect and far fetched. ""Red Dragon"" by Thomas Harris blew this book away."
1,Lame Continuation of the Bone Collector,I truly despied this book. The writing was great. I will the author that much but it just went on and on and on. The story was going NOWHERE! I was so excited to get a book that continued one of my favorite books last year- The Bone Collector. This truly was a waste of my time. I finished it just so I could I have a closure to this book.
3,Mediocre at best.,"I thought the Bone Collector was heavy into the technical terms of forensics. That is until I read this book.I would have enjoyed it more if it left out half of the police abbreviations (i.e. ERC, IED, CI, OEMs. geez, I felt like I was back in the military) Then there where four pages involving an explosive device. For crying out loud do we really need to know E-VERY LIT-TLE DETAIL?! How about leaving some things to the reader's imagination eh?I found myself skipping over several rambling paragraphs, just to keep from getting flustrated and blowing it up! Maybe I should used come C three or C four or RDX. Ooo wait! Maybe CG because it smells so sweet.Since I borrowed it from a library, I suppose that wouldn't be right. Plus there's no way, I would be willing give my hard earned money for a replacement copy."
1,"Another formulaic book written ""by the numbers""","This tired potboiler has just too many twists, turns and just-in-time brilliant deductions by the hero super-sleuth to be credible.And why must the psychopathic killer always be a ""latent homosexual""? C'mon, Mr. Deaver. Try for something original next time."
3,Dance If You Must,"A fair read but not as good as ""The Bone Collector."" Rhyme doesn't have as much to do in this one except get all mushy for Amelia Sachs. The hitman angle wasn't really a fitting crime situation for a criminalist to sink his teeth into. I will still read ""The Empty Chair"" (the third Lincoln Rhyme novel) because Rhyme is such an interesting character. I hope he has more to do in that one than in ""The Coffin Dancer."" This one just plodded along."
4,Deaver has a new fan!!,"Actually, I had just read Devil's Teardrop before reading Coffin Dancer. But I still consider myself a new fan. Since many people here have discussed the plot, I'm not going to.Deaver puts a fasinating spin on crime solving, with Lincoln Rhyme's forensic skills. Sometimes I find that the deductions and conclusions drawn from a piece of sand or a small piece of latex a bit out there. However it does make for interesting story telling, and for all I now, may be very possible among forensic scientists.Both of the Deaver books I've read have truly suprise endings, which I love, and suspect is part of his formula. The action is mostly non-stop. The characters are fairly interesting. And the suspense grows as the story moves on.The only reason I didn't give The Coffin Dancer 5 stars is, that at times, the pace dragged on a bit. Otherwise, I'd say it is a highly recommended read. Next stop...The Empty Chair."
4,great twist,Jeffery Deaver has an amazing way of keeping you interested all the way through the book with a great twist at the end
2,"good until the ""surprise ending""","I enjoyed this book, until the true identity of the 'Coffin Dancer' was revealed. Actually, I enjoyed the book until I had a chance to think about it. . . and think about how completely ridiculous and unrealistic the surprise twist was- I'm tired of mystery and suspense writers relying upon amazingly unrealistic shock endings, rather than intelligently crafted ones. Perhaps all the talent died with Dame Agatha? One more thing. . . the bit about altitude-sensitive bombs on airplanes: does Deaver have any idea how many times the 5,000ft/Denver thing has been used???"
4,A great read,"This book is not quite as good as The Bone Collector but another great book by Mr. Deaver. It starts really slow then pick up the pace once he got started. As with all Deaver's books, he always come up with a lot of surprises and supsense and this one is no exception."
4,Another masterful suspense novel!,"I enjoyed this one, with the return of Lincoln Rymes and Amelia Sachs for THE BONE COLLECTOR. This time they have to find a serial killer for hire. The twists and turns Deaver throws in keeps you on the edge and the final undressing of exactly waht is going on is a shocker! Great stuff."
3,Lacking spark of Bone Collector,"I became a big fan of Deaver's after I had read Bone Collector. Maybe that left me disappointed after reading the Coffin Dancer.Coffin Dancer is a good book, and reading more about Lincoln and Sachs was great, but it didn't live up to the Bone's level.But I am still going to buy the latest novel with these characters."
3,Not All That Great...,"The book keeps you wondering what's going to happen next. Once you find out what happens, it's not exactly what was expected (in a depressing way). Rhyme and Sachs are great characters, but this book doesn't compare at all to The Bone Collector. The aviation talk bored me and the twist ending was a bit too drastic to completely grab my attention. Not enough suspense for me. Sorry Deaver, you could do much better."
4,Does what I wanted,"I wanted a thumb drive that would support no-fuss encrypted partitions, and that's just what I got. Allocate anything from 32MB to the whole stick as a partition, name it, give it a password and a virtual drive letter, and you're done.I've used it on Windows XP and 2000 Pro without incident.I deduct one star for some options I'd like to see in the GUI. For example, one can automatically explore the mounted drive when the password is given, or automatically ask, but there's no option to do nothing. There's also no ""mount all favorite drives"" option as in, for example, TrueCrypt.Still, for carrying around highly personal information without worrying about what happens if I lose the stick, this is just what I wanted at a fair price."
3,Security software does NOT autostart,"If it doesn't bother to you browsing inside the jumpdrive and starting the security software manually before you can see your secured files, then it's OK. In fact, I think that no secure jumpdrive in the market can do that right now."
5,Great Price - Great Jump Drive,"This is pretty amazing if you think about it:A one gig drive for under 40 dollars.Thank you Amazon and Lexar, it works great !"
2,Very slow,"My best USB drive is the Lexar Media JDE512-231 JumpDrive Elite USB 2.0 512MB drive which I had for about a year and a half. But I needed more space, so I thought I would buy this as the upgrade since it's made by the same company and has the same brand name and they don't make the other model in 1 G anymore. This drive is very slow. I timed the same backup procedure on both drives, and my older 512 MB was at least twice as fast."
1,CAUTION!,"I have a document, encrypted with this product, and now I cannot decrypt it. I called Lexar, they said they'd email me software to fix the problem. How long with that take, I asked. Thirty minutes, I was told. It's 28 hours and counting now. I sent them an email, too. No response yet. Buy this product if you want to keep yourself from seeing your own documents! Good luckFollow-up: Lexar emailed a link to new software which remedied the problem, about 36 hours after they said they would. The problem appears to have been the user's (i.e., my) deletion of what appeared to be an empty folder labeled ""vaults"" that comes on the device."
2,No RAID support,"SuSE 8.1 does not support RAID. Would not recommend it for servers or anything else with HW RAID or needing RAID support. Try alternate distrobution (RH 8 Personal or Pro will work and can be used on a server w/RAID)It is a great product. But, only if you plan on using it on a PC/Laptop (without SCSI or HW RAID)Recommend anyone wanting to evaluate this product, go to linuxiso.org and download the various free distrobutions and determine which flavor of Linux is best for their tastes."
5,Book Nitty-Gritty...,"Eastland Press out of Seattle has done a wonderful job designing and binding the English version of this Shanghai text.Navy cloth over boards with gold print; sewn binding; 741 pp; 3.5 pounds. Illustrations in b&w;: drawings, charts, tables, and several big fold-out pagesThe book is divided into the following Parts: Channels, Points, Techniques, and Therapy.With 4 Appendices, 2 Indexes, 3 Bibliographies, and an over 30 page Introduction."
4,Glad to have this in my collection.,It's a hardcover book I purchased for the Orpheus and Eurydice myth (for research.) It includes the entire story with information I had not seen in other versions of Ovid. It has the Latin across the page from the English.The Pygmalian story and others in this volume will also be useful for future lectures.My only quibble: the print is so small.Kathleen Burt
3,what you d expect,"the cd has the two main hits from east 17, it's alright and thunder. other than that, not much, though it is still a pretty pleasant cd to listen to overall"
2,kingston brass faucet,"I have now had this faucet a couple years and all 3 are still working but the handles are not adjustable we even called the company to see if there was a secret to it. The handles were at the 10 & 4 o'clock positions and looked horrible that way. I have only ever seen these handles at the 9 & 3 o'clock positions which is what I expected and wanted. We liked the look enough to make our own adjustments which voided the warranty and does effect the function of the faucet, we really should have returned them. This wasn't a fluke thing all 3 faucets had the same issue with the handles."
2,Not the best quality,Hard to complain at the price offered but they are really not the best quality. The jaws are misaligned and the final polish is very uneven.
4,Great for the money,Good pair of locking forceps. Not the highest quality but I'd be confident using them in an emergency. Be aware the the tip is curved--it's not noticeable in the picture.
3,Pakistan Instrument,"It's of cheap quality, pakistan instrument, however if will suffice for nursing school. When I ordered I thought it was going to be a better quality instrument."
3,Not quite what I expected,"You can't beat the price on this product, but I was really disappointed in its quality. It's really hard to get the forceps to release when closed. Quality of the metal is cheap and poor. If you are in the medical or veterinary field I would recommend splurging for something else. I purchased this product to assist with neurological examination on canines, but won't end up using it for that."
4,No problem...,Product is as expected no bells or whistles just a straight pair of strong hemostats and who can complain about that. Shipped in a timely manner with no problems. Will use these sellers again.
3,"It's okay, but","my six-year old child got bored with it very, very quickly. I agree that part of the problem is the lack of directions or even hints in the game itself. We couldn't figure out what needed to be done and my kids didn't want to wait around while I read the directions. And one of the creatures always looks angry so my six-year old spent a lot of time trying to make it happy and she couldn't. Other than that, the controls are pretty easy, and my kids liked it for a bit. But I wouldn't buy it again."
2,"This is ""the best"" of Deep Purple?","Check the list of songs before you buy. With a couple of exceptions, these are by no means ""the best"" of Deep Purple."
3,3 live songs on Nobody's perfect,"I usually don't like live version and got 3 in this book; Lazy, Child in time and Hush from the Nobody's perfect album. Guitar tab are quite accurate though."
5,Great device!,"I love my Nomad. Use headphones, connect to your Mac or PC or speaker system. Easy interface and so much space. I have 375 mp3 tracks on mine and still room for more! Even complete audio books. Very cool."
1,"Great concept but very buggy, think twice - read all reviews","Well, first its a great concept and initially you'll think - this is better than sliced bread!Problem is that this unit has 2 major design flaws, if you don't get one of them - you'll probably get the other. I was 'lucky"" enough to get them both.1. Battery bug - ahh yes - this is a stinker. After a while, the NJB stops charging the batteries fully. There's a long explanation as to why - but problem is that you're stuck. Your NJB which is supposed to last 4 hours on battery will start to last 45 minuted.2. Frequent hangs causing reformats: this one is really bad. Many people, such as myself, have encountered the dreaded ""freeze"" in which the NJB fails to boot (yes boot, it has a hard drive remember?) and the only thing tech support can say is ""reformat it"" therefore losing all your data (music.)Think twice before buying it, we have a love hate relationship. Its great when it works, but man - too many bugs."
4,great piece of hardware,"i love this thing, it just holds sooooooo much music, it is a bit heavy which is why i only rated it 4 stars, but it works wonderfully."
4,One of the best mix tapes for early 90's dance music,I loved this CD when I first got it in 1992. It has some of the best dance songs from the early 90's. This CD always made me dance and it will always have a place in my CD collection. If ever in the mood for some good old East Coast dance music this CD is the one to buy.
4,Good product,This will not produce factory quality unless one is able to strip the barrel down to bare metal - yet this product did an excellent job turning an old mosin nagant from poor to awesome!
5,A Story of Courage and Encouragement for Others,"I had the opportunity to meet Chris Reeve when he was doing ""Fifth of July"" in New York. I have met a lot of celebrities in my lifetime, and I must say Christopher was one of the absolutely nicest of them all. His genuine love for people came through in the brief moments my friends and I spent with him. It shines through even more in this book, through his praise for the medical staff, his friends, and his family. I just had a former student suffer a serious spine injury. I plan to send him a copy of this book to teach him there is still hope and personal progress available to him and all who suffer the same type of accidents. Thanks Chris for sharing your tragedy and personal triumph with us all."
4,Poignant,"I am almost done with this, and I can honestly say I developed a lot of empathy of what it must be like to have your life as you know it taken from you in a flash. He recounts his daily struggles and attempts to stay in show business very well, and his accounts of what he had to go through every day made me feel sorry for him. His accounts of his early days of an actor were a little boring, but were probably put in there for his true fans. I am sorry he passed, he seemed like a decent person who did not deserve his fate, and he makes an inspiring case for dealing with our struggles, rather than shying away from them."
4,INFORMATIVE AND A BIT DEPRESSING.,"I FOUND THIS BOOK GAVE ME A MUCH BETTER INSIGHT TO THE SEVERE LIMITATIONS AND STRUGGLES THAT OCCUR WITH THIS HORRIBLE TYPE OF INJURY,I BELIEVE MANY WOULD RATHER JUST DIE. I WISHED THERE WAS MORE IN THIS BOOK ABOUT HIS OWN INTIMATE THOUGHTS AND HIS WORST FEARS ABOUT THE FUTURE, LESS ON HIS HOLLYWOOD CAREER, THAT PART SEEMED SO TRIVIAL TO WHAT THIS BOOK WAS SUPPOSE TO BE ABOUT."
2,More of a biography than an inspiration.,"I didn't expect to read anything about Mr. Reeves acting career in this book. I was looking for inspiration and understanding as to how his injury is tolerable or unbearable, and everything in between. I did enjoy reading about the amazing folks who work with him. Wasn't what I expected, I hate to say I was disappointed, I hope the book brings attention to the reach that it needed."
2,A disjointed story of a charmed life.,"I admire Christopher Reeve for all he has accomplished before and after becoming disabled, however, this tale of his life is confusing and disjointed in its sequencing. Events are not chronological. For example, he tells of seeing his grandfather three times in twenty years and then jumps to another topic. He jumps from his life with Gae Exton to Dana and back again with other events thrown in between. Shorter chapters in chronological order would have made this book more interesting. And while I have sympathy for the tragedy which befell him, how many others have suffered this fate without the benefits of individual attention by doctors, nurses, security guards, and more. While recovering in the hospital after the accident,Chris mentions he didn't like the food. A chef at a nearby restaurant offered to cook him anything he would like at no charge. Is this the norm? I think not."
4,goosebumps,This honestly written books gave me goosebumps. The first two chapters are the most riveting.
3,"Engaging, but ultimately disappointing","I was interested in Christopher Reeve's story, and was drawn in completely by the first chapter. Sorry to say, though, the story turned treacly and boring quickly. Mr. Reeve's acting career is not interesting enough to keep the reader engaged, and he didn't delve into the world of the wheelchair-bound enough. While he has obviously brought attention to spinal cord injuries, he didn't weave that story well enough to keep my interest."
3,anguishing and awestrucking,"I really don't know if I'd ever have his strenght. it is astonishing to read how much of a life he was able to have when anyone would think his life was over. sure, money does help but his core was really steel! and his wife's too!it's humbling to read this book and inspiring, but it's also quite anguishing. I'm glad I read it"
4,Written to make money?,"I went at this book with great gusto. Having grown up in norhtern NJ and having a great love for horses....I was interested. It reads well but something is lacking, and I don't know what. I admire Mr. Reeve for his dedication to the cause of spinal cord injuries but, I think, he has taken this project on with the idea of making money and,hopefully, subsidizing his income. I have questions....did he marry Dana because she was pregnant? Since he exposes ALL, I think I am allowed to ask this. Anyway, it's a poorly written bio but should get lots of sympathy and empathy."
3,An inspirational read but sometimes slow.,Who can't help but feel for what happened to Christopher Reeve and his family. A true tragedy. But it is amazing how a positive attitude about a desperate situation makes you realize how resillient we can be if we try.
3,Good Stuff,"The most interesting part of this book (of course) is how Reeve gets the courage to fight back when he's told that his injury will never get better. You feel that you are there with him on his hospital bed as he courageously breathes for half an hour without a respirator. I just don't know how he did it. Perhaps it takes a tragedy to bring out the greatness in a man.To be honest, Reeve's career before the accident is not very interesting. The good part is that at least Reeve presents everything honestly. You get to trace his path from his days as an obnoxious youth, through his days at Juilliard, quick rise in fame to Superman, and then a long slump. Overall, this is a good book and I enjoyed listening to him read the book himself."
3,I'm not sure the problem is with the product,"The product works the way it is supposed to, I guess. I even had the right kind of stencil. The problem is that the combination doesn't work the way it is supposed to. You can't connect the stencil to itself to make a long border and get it to connect in the right places. The pounce pad is so imprecise you don't know when you've succeeded in marking and when you haven't.Three decades ago, when I made my first quilt, I made my own stencil and my own pounce out of talcum powder. This certainly is better and I expect the marking would last a lot longer than the talcum powder did, but still brush away when you no longer wanted it. So, as you can tell, I understand the system. But it just did not work for me."
2,Very Disappointed,"I saw a video of how to use this product on Nancy's Notions website. She made it look so easy--just tamp the applicator in the tray that comes with it, rub it over the stencil and there is your sewing line all ready to be quilted. Unfortunately it didn't work that way for me. You have to tamp the pad a lot to get the powder to work its way though the pad and it did not come through evenly even though I tried to shake the powder around to make sure it covered the whole pad. Then after I swiped it over the stencil the line was not very distinct--it had a halo around the lines. The part that really bothered me though was that the line rubbed off before I had it quilted. Just with the movement necessary to move the piece around while stitching caused enough movement to rub the chalk marks off. I don't know if there is a way to make the powder stick to the fabric better. I would not buy this product again."
2,Doesn't Really Work,"This just seemed like such a good idea I got one as a gift for my friend who taught me to quilt and one for myself. It's an old concept that goes back to the beginning of quilting days, and it would makes sense if only it really worked. The power doesn't make a durable mark. It's messy and the markings dust right off, especially when handling the fabric, which has to be done while doing the quilting. We each only used it once and now it just sits in the drawer. I should toss it keep thinking I'll discover a way to pounce on the chalk and have it actually stay."
5,Pretty Peel,"This pizza peel is the larger of the two peels that I bought; I didn't know what I would need. I like having a large one and a smaller one. We never just make one pizza at a time. I don't always need a large one, but it is nice to have. I didn't put oil on this peel either I just sprinkle with corn meal and wipe it with a dry rag when I am finished using it. Both peels hang on the wall and look very nice. I feel like a real pizza maker now! I am very pleased."
4,It's a Pizza Peel,"It works the way you would expect. I did notice a little bit of bending of the wood after a couple uses, but not enough to cause any sort of concern. I really like the feel of using the wood paddle. It just adds to the experiences of baking pizza and bread."
4,Good Peel,"Not really solid wood and warped a little because someone left it in the sink. All in all, decent for the price and does what it's supposed to do."
3,Meh,"There is no finish on this pizza peel. Get it wet and it'll warp, although the warping goes away after about a week. Get the same-sized bamboo version for cheaper."
2,Much too much about God,"This book was referred to me by someone from my temple, but it's really for Christians. There is way too much mention of Christianity and God and it did not make me feel better at all. I was actually angry at how many times God was mentioned. It was also homophobic and insulting to homosexuals."
1,"A surprise, but not a good one...","I had this book before and loved it, so I wanted to replace it. Was thrilled when I saw I could get it for such a low price, but surprised and disappointed when the product arrived. I don't think the dimensions listed are correct because what I received was a tiny ""gift book"" about the size of my palm. There were short verses in the book, not the story that actually appears in the book by the same name.Wasn't worth the return postage to send it back, but will be much more careful if shopping with this vendor in the future."
3,Live with it,The funniest part was things that we as parents have all said to our children.Another persons opinion of our childrens choices has gotten to be too much of everyone's business. Makes you wonder what are they hiding. I sympathized with them all and then I thought they don't need my sympathy it isn't as if they are ax murderers. Respect each others choices
1,WARNING!,"I give this not even one star! They TOTALLY changed everything. Sakura's name isn't Sakura Avalon, its Sakura Kinomoto!! And Li Showron is surpose to be Syaoran Li! I warn you, buy the orginal, ""Cardcaptor Sakura"" instead of the baka... dubbed verison! Cardcaptors is nothing compared to Cardcaptor Sakura. One of the reason they changed Cardcaptor Sakura to Cardcaptors is because they think Cardcaptor Sakura is a ""too girly"" and so they wanted more boy viewers so they named it Cardcaptors and made ""Li"" one of the main characters...."
3,Macro,"By fixing it to wide angel lens it had gave me an amazing magnification scal more than 1:1. However, the sharpness and the focusing is a real mater this time"
1,A research paper,The editor Bilson a lousy professor has published his research papers. Therefore this book will not help you learn FX.
4,Well... defiantly not for teens...,"I am only giving this 4 stars because I am a teenager. After dropping one of my favorite games (Star Stable online), I needed a new adventure game. I thought that this would be fun. I was SOOOOOOOOOOO wrong. I am the only person there. Completely alone. The teenage rider looks 40 years old. The competitions were too easy. I am sorely disappointed, for the only thing I liked about this was the graphics. Some of them aren't even that good. If you are over 8 or 9 years old, don't get it. Save your money and try something worth wild."
2,Let's ride,"To be honest, I couldn't even rememer ordering this, so I'm guessing I wasn't real crazy about it. I never play it. I must have started too, then decided it wasn't what I had hoped for."
2,It was ok...,"When I first got it, it was fun, but then after a while I stopped playing it. It says over 10 different breeds, but the horses are no different. All you do is enter competitions and groom your horse..I don't really think this is one of the better games."
3,It's ok...,"I think that this game is ok, if you just like to ride. You don't do much of learning how to take care of your horse, except to brush, bathe, feed, and water your horse. All you really do is just ride. There are a lot of horse combinations (color, markings) which I think is good...It's ok if you like to win western competitions like barrels, and poles."
3,Great game - for newer computers,"Santa brought this game for my girls, who are 4 and 6. Both have really enjoyed playing the game - on my newer computer. They have their own computer - a 2002 Sony VAIO. It will not play on this machine. I have updated all the drivers and still no go. I read someone with Vista custom installed and did the same with no better results. Finally emailed support and did receive a prompt reply. My video card is too old to play the game. So be sure your video card meets the specs - 32MB 3D graphics and FULLY DIRECTX 8.1 compatible.It's a great game for my kid's age as it becomes a little redundant after you've fed, watered and ridden a couple of times. But they don't care. They just change the horse's color or the like and keep on playing!"
2,"ok, but boring and not much to do.","This game was not as fun as other games I have. This game you didn't get to do much, and the graphics are not too good. I have seen just about every horse game ever made for computers. This one was NOT the greatest. The was chopps and easy to practice, but hard to beet."
5,A must read for anyone and everyone!,"This book is truly touching. I finished reading it today for the 10th time within the year I have gotten it I believe. It is a true story of how even though times get rough, our Lord Jesus is always by us and so are his tattered angels."
3,ear muffler,it works like advertised but goes thru batteries fairly quickly. I am pleased with the way they cancel out the noise but still hear people talking around you
4,Neiko Pro-Quality Muff Style Electronic Ear Protector,The product was shipped quickly and arrived in 3 days. Quality product and it works as described. Great price and value.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE,"I brought the pump base on Blackburn name, thinking it was a quality product, but I was wrong. Had the pump for less than 4 month and used no more than 3 times and it's leaking air! It's pretty much useless."
3,Subject content not for younger readers!,"Although this book was well written and illustrated I found that the content is not what I would like to read my five year old at bedtime. The book focuses on a homeless (for lack of a better word) woman and her daily life, which is not a happy one. The title of this book would make anyone think that the book is humourous. I did not find it humourous at all, actually I found it quite sad. I do believe that this story would be helpful to older children to understand that there are people in our communities who are less fortunate than we are, however, it may not be beneficial to the younger ones who may not yet understand the situations that could affect any of us at some time during our lives."
5,excellent book!,Couldn't disagree with the second review more! Sillie Tillie's story is much more important for younger readers to know and understand. Homelessness is an issue children will be made to confront at some point in their young lives and teaching them to be kind to the people experiencing it is of the utmost importance!
4,I swear this stuff works,"The Loreal Sublime Slim definitely makes a visible difference on my thighs. I haven't tried the really expensive treatments, so I cannot say it is the best stuff out there. But I have tried the lower priced ones, and they do absolutely nothing. For the money, I think anyone would be exceptionally pleased with the Loreal...really, it does work!"
1,Illegal Copy,This book was first published in 1941 and the Author died in 1999. It is still under copyright and this copy is unlicensed and illegal.
5,Principles of Fire Behaviour,"As the first word states in the title, the book offers a wide overview on fire behaviour. Personaly the book represented the introduction to the Heat Transfer Class during the MSc in Fire Safety Enginnering at UUJ. Providing me with the necessary fundamentals it was a great help to approch further studies of scientific papers.The book is very well written. It is kept to a simple level for the obvious purpose of providing the student with basic undestanding of complicated issues. From my personal point of view, the simplicity and fluidity of the book are an huge advantage of the work itself, at least among all those which I have came accross.Strongly advised for those who are approching a fire enginnering degree and also for those professional which need a mental stimulus for solving fire engineering issues. Very interesting: Ignition, Radiation, Fire Behavior, Plume Behavior and the articles collection of fire investigation at the end of the book."
3,Principles of Fire Behavior,"The book has never heard of ""laymans"" terms, so be prepared for some tough reading. Our teachers feel we should burn it but it is the ONLY book written for the course material."
4,This is My Father,This movie was a wonderful movie to watch. The movie was full of complex and at time conflicting emotion. The plot kept you interested through out the whole movie. The only draw back is the constant moving from past to present that I found really distracting. But all in all I would highly recommend this movie particularly if you are interested in the Irish culture and love stories with interesting psychological/emotional plots.
4,Sleeper,"Why don't we ever hear about great films like this one. It has a wonderful story with a tearful conclusion. It is worth seeing, if only for the glimpse of Irish culture in 1939 and surely accurate depiction of the Catholic Church of that time. One gets the notion that in the Irish countryside of today, the Church probably still operates as it does in this film.Aidan Quinn, who went out of his way to make this film, is terrific in his part as Kieran O'Day. He gained weight for the film and it is far from a glitzy role. Actually, all the acting is top notch and the characters are all believeable. Having grown up in a Catholic Church that is very close to what is portrayed in the film, made it even more interesting for me.It's not a flashy film, but one of the best of this century."
1,Same old Irish drivel,I am sick to death of this kind of Irish film where the same old actors are wheeled out in their tweed jackets and flat-caps to portray yet another load of down-trodden Irish characters with something to moan and whinge about. Films about modern Ireland never ever seem to be made and I get the feeling that the world must think that Ireland is stuck in the 1940s as thats all you ever see in these films.The story is the usual rubbish about forbidden love and it's been done a thousand times before. I do however disagree with the comment by a reviewer which claims that this film is 'anti-catholic' - it is not - this is unfortunatly how Ireland was at that time - ruled by the iron fist of the church. But this need by Irish film directors to constantly hark back to this time period is beyond me. Have they no other ideas they can turn into a film?Utter rubbish
4,Irish revolution viewed from a bank...,"Irish revolutionnaries in Dublin. They try to invest the city. We follow a group of them in a bank. And a young woman trapped in the ""lavatories"" (in english in the text) fianc√©e of an english captain... A story of innocent people who tempted to enter the history. Written in a fresh and joyful language.For more information this book is a part of another which title is ""the private diary of Sally Mara"" which is really worthwhile to read."
3,Vintage Melodrama Creeks Like the Dickens,"Being an avid fan of both cinema and Charles Dickens I was looking forward to seeing this adaption, one of the few I had not seen. One of the lesser known Dickens film outings, it was made in Britain in 1934 and tells the story of an elderly gambling man and his granddaughter whose lives are effected by the miserly, stunted Mr Quilp. The film is well made and well acted (although Hay Petrie is a terrible ham in his role as Quilp) but is dreadfully dated (infact it looks much older than it is) and never having read the book before was unprepared for the unhappy ending (though I should have guessed knowing Dickens) which left me rather cold (and makes me wonder how the 1970's musical version 'Quilp' turned out?). Still the film is enjoyable to a degree and anyone who loves Dickens and old fashioned melodramas should find something to like about it."
4,an old english curiousity.,"This antique adaptation of a minor Dickens classic is notable for its period feel. Filmed in 1934, Hay Petrie as the stage villain Quilp gives a bravura performance with much mugging at the camera and an acrobatic virility as the evil dwarf who holds an old man and his daughter in his evil clutches by funding his reckless gambling knowing that the old man will never be able to repay the debt, the old curiousity shop being the old man's only asset. There have been many adaptations since but none with the raw power of Hay Petrie's performance."
1,"Terrible, get Carter instead","I didn't buy this book (thank god) but got it out from my University library to do a bit of a refresher on GT for ""fun"". Firstly it's only about 100 pages of sparse text and clearly not worth $60. Secondly the first 3 chapters make very little sense and have terribly confusing questions (and no answers) that will turn you off before you get to later on in the book. And on top of that there are mistakes in a number of the calculations (check table 5.2 if you were silly enough to buy it). Get carter instead, it's the same price and is actually a really decent book."
3,Thanks for the evidence base!,"All too often in management and leadership, the evidence is simply lacking and authors rant and rave about their personal experiences. This book reflects on an analysis of a lot of data collected from all over the place using all sorts of different methods. Dispite this initial flaw in the collection phase, the patterns that emerged are consistent and well supported. In many cases the results confirm what we all know, but some are refreshingly surprising. I enjoyed this book from a scholarly and a personal perspective but felt it got bogged down a little after the first half. Nevertheless a good read."
3,Good Reading,The reading in this book is really infomative. It gives managers a way of opening up their mind. Most manager will already know what is in this book but by reading it it will make your more aware and conscious of the things. I suggest this book.
3,BUY THE BOOK!,The audio CD was was TOO abridged to be fully useful for anything other than a teaser to buy the book. It was very disappointing. Others - Good to Great - Execution - offer an unabridged version. I usually listed to the CD and buy the book as a reference. This time I had to buy the book to get enough of the details to be meaningful.
4,An insightful look into successful management practices,"I suppose it's not surprising that I found ""First, Break All the Rules"" such a good read: It codified many of my own practices developed intuitively over the years. At the same time, I found many suggestions that I plan to incorporate into my management style. If you've ever been asked to pound a square peg into a round hole, this book will give you good ammunition to battle the conformists."
5,Excellent,This is a great book on a step by step guide to managing people based on Gallup research rather than opionion.
5,Good reinforcement for us all,"If you ever wondered whether not following the PC motions of management were the wrong approach, this book makes some sense of it.Although at times the constant mention of the size of the Gallup poll taken, this book was very informative. It uses great examples, and covers a lot of material that is useful to a beginning manager. I would recommend this to anyone that has or is thinking about making a career move into management."
1,"First, You should know what you are talking about","I began reading this book with an open mind. I am an HR VP with over 20 years of experience at Fortune 500 organizations. This book tries to be iconoclastic and innovative for line management, however, any good manager should see through its marketing and catchy title. This book is based on the ""strengths"" concept which has no empirical data other than that done by those on the Gallup payroll.I strongly recommend sticking with more trusted and proven business advice from better publishers and authors with degrees in the field in which they are writing about."
1,yet another management book,"I only own two books. The other one is The Bible. This book is required reading at my business. We enjoy reading about how to manage excellent people. Since our people are so good at what they do, as long as we leave them alone, they do a great job, and I can afford to put high octane gas in my Lexus. It also gives me a lot of time to read other revolutionary management books.To me, management books are the essense of life. I have read hundreds of them. My favorite three are: 1) First, Break All the Rules 2) First, Break All the Rules 3) First, Break All the Rules"
5,Great overall book with many good perspectives.,It is good to see a business text written that does not profess and/or propagate the standard business rhythms rather prescribes to look into the natural rhythms that are around us and mold managements processes to capitalize on these.
5,First Break All the Rules,"If you are in the position to hire and/or manage employees, this book is a must read. It reaffirms, what most managers know but are scared to do because of corporate/company correctness. It gives a different perspective, on turning employee's talents into performance."
5,Great Book !!,"since 2001, i bought this book several times and gave some to all the people those need this book which i think is a great book to read, but you need to read the other two books [ Now Discover Your Strength and Go Put Your Strength to Work]because the Talent Themes and the Strength here are not fixed yet.The Key of a Great Managers are the efective and intensif communication with their sub ordinates.Effective because there are mostly talking about discovering sub ordinate Strength and find ways to channel it.Intensif because they have a face to face meeting 1 hour every three month, not once a year during the performance appraisal.This kind of communication create a very positif atmosfeer."
5,First Break all the rules,"This is an excellent book on CD. You can listen to it in your car or Ipod. This is a book for every manager who wants to get more from their employees. It describes how you must break the rules of equality because people are motivated by different things, some money and others time off or benefits. It is a great book to enjoy."
2,Hard Not to Put Down,"Save your money. Although there was some good information in here, I felt like I had to search long and far to find it. Many BORING details as to how the data was compiled. This book could have been something better if the authors had just spent more time providing examples that did not put you to sleep. Don't get me wrong, I am SURE the Gallop institute's data correct. However, this book needs to be rewritten so that the examples inspire and provide clearer examples of how to be a great manager/leader. Sorry ..."
2,Had a few good point BUT.....,"Overall, I think the point of this book was well thought out, I just have a hard time believing it could be put into practice anywhere in the 'real' world. A lot of things are good ideas, however, it just wouldn't work in a 'real' work environment. To me, this book focuses more on 'carrers' than the 'jobs' of life. Which is good, to an extent.I had to read this for my management class and a lot of my classmates (about 90%) shared my dislikes."
1,Not so revolutionary,In my view this book offered more of the same - trite generalizations. Granted they seem to have done their homework. But their insights can hardly be called revolutionary.
2,A book 150 pages too long,"Few business books are really interesting and brief enough to be read. First...is not one of them. The authors talk and talk, example after example. It is 150 pages too long! It is a pity they did not do a better job with the Gallup material!! Not worth."
1,Kindle Version,"I wish this book would be available in a kindle version, so I don't have to carry the book and iPad at the same time."
5,Worth Your Time,"For any manager who sincerely wants to be more productive and create positive working relationships this is a ""must"" read. If you're comfortable with old paradigms (""We've always done it this way."") or aren't comfortable with change, then forget it!"
3,Treat different people differently,"Some people need to be babied, some need to be fired. The ""rule"" that's broken? Treat everyone the same.The book's true insights, however, are in their discoveries of what employees really want in a company: money? No. Not as much as an enriching environment with contribution to a cause. According to their extensive research, internal rewards trump dollars."
3,No rules broken,"I thought I would like the British accent, but it grew old very fast.I can sum up this book in one line.Treat people according to their strengths and talents and don't waste time trying to change people.I just saved you hours of an annoying accent. Next Ill save you money on your car insurance."
4,A Great Book for Great Managers,"What rules do the great managers break? Identify an employee's strengths and weaknesses, and then try to develop and ""pull up"" the weaknesses. Wrong.Marcus and Curt say to do four things differently:1. Hire for talent (not experience).2. Define the goals.3. Focus on strengths (not weaknesses).4. Find the right fit.It sounds obvious, but it hasn't been for decades of management and leadership development.* Mark Kelly, coauthor of MASTERING TEAM LEADERSHIP: 7 ESSENTIAL COACHING SKILLS"
1,Work for them and see for yourself.,"This book was published once before under the name of ""Soar With Your Strengths"". This is the second 100 page + brochure selling Gallup's selection products."
5,I thought I was a good manager until I read this book.,"This book is refreshing. The research is excellent. I have always thought of myself as a good manager. Many of the things I think are important are in this book. I wish I could say I followed all the advice. I can not argue with any of the advice in this book. I bought the CD version first, and then the hard cover. This book is one you will go through several times. If you buy this book, don't tell your peers. You will have a competitive advantage."
4,Agree with a previous reviewer,"I liked the book and learned from it. However, I agree with a previous reviewer who said that this book doesn't go far enough by addressing real-world leadership issues. I also recommend, like that reviewer, another outstanding and well written book also to supplement your skills and knowledge: it's called ""The Leader's Guide: 15 Essential Skills."""
3,Cliche all the way,"This got so cliche that I couldn't even finish it! It's anecdotes only carry the concept so far before it gets ridiculous. Challenging the Stauts Quo is essential to staying on top of your business and there are some good concepts around that idea int his book but that could be captured in 100 pages. I'm afraid to start ""Now discover your strengths.""... Try ""Management Challenges for the 21st Century"" if you need some good ideas on where management is going...good luck!"
2,Not at all impressed,"Maybe I needed to manage my expectations better, but I didn't really get too much out of this book. Generally I am able to salvage 1 or 2 takeaways from a book like this, but I'm struggling with this one."
2,I didn't even care to finish it... and it's audio.,"I didn't care for the cases the authors made. Maybe it's because I jumped into it right after ""Good to Great"" from Collins. I mean who can stand next to Jim Collins right? This book seemed amateurish and made poor cases in comparison. Although not exactly the same topic, I was overall not impressed with the fact or hard examples and specifics that were sprinkled here and there.It's like listening to a Sermon without any biblical context. Ha ha... I think that describes it well."
3,Just okay,"I've read and listened to a great deal of management and business books and this one was just average. Nothing earth shaking nor groundbreaking. Good info if you are a ""newbie"" to management but for more advanced or knowledgable managers I would recommend the Jack Welch series of books instead."
4,a good read,I was required to read this book for an Organizational Theory and Behavior class at college. I found it to be very insightful. What made the most sense to me was the authors' distinction between talent and skills/knowledge. I would reccomend this to any manager who wants productive employees.
1,No good take homes...,"As a fairly new manager and small business owner I was looking for a book that gave me some great basics on how to lead, motivate, and manage people. By about page 98 I realized this book was not going to deliver any salient points. I've never written a review, but felt strongly about passing this on, as the close to 5 star review is what motivated me to purchase the book. I'd assume most people needing to read a book like this are like me, and tremendously busy without time to waste - I felt obligated to warn other readers against wasting their time."
2,A Hard Sell of Pop-science,"Seems that Buckingham and Coffman have gone for the sales approach of a TV shampoo commercial - baffle them with science. From the extensive references of their research which they assure us goes beyond any research done previously, to their neuro-science analogy of highways and dead ends, the authors manage to fill 200 pages with - what? We get a checklist of questions that a manager should ask themselves. We get a serious rewrite of the Mercury programme and of the responses of the astronauts. We get a bizarre overview of what they believe talent is (complete with a highly amusing and faulty series of word activities). And we get a hard hard sell that they have the answers we are all looking for.This book falls squarely into the idea-as-hero category. Read with a critical eye, it is full of pretty fluff and little substance. I cannot recommend this book."
5,Simply the best management book I've ever read.,"The researchers and author behind this much-needed book started with a simple question: What do the world's best managers do differently from all other managers? And approached the question in a scientific manner, first doing research to determine who the best managers in the world were, and then examining their abilities and actions from every angle (along with the abilities and actions of average managers) to see what set them apart.The result is deceptively simple and decidedly powerful; focus on the strengths of those who work for you. It obviously gets more involved than that and explains how to deal with the weaknesses of your reports, but I've put these principles into action in my business and have gotten measurable results.I recommend this book for any manager. It helped me in a very real, measurable way."
5,4 Keys to a more productive Workforce,"This very readable book is based on thousands of interviews and clearly outlines implementable steps to hire and keep a more productive workforce. The Gallup organization has found 12 questions that give you the most information and the most important information about your organization. Their analogy of Mountain Climbing not only prescribes a process to reach success but also explains why some of the other productivity initiatives have not been as successful as hoped. Successful managers have challenged conventional wisdom and the 4 Keys start with Selecting for Talent. From a training perspective, a controversial argument was made for not training people to improve their weaknesses but to focus on their strengths. We are using this book as a foundation to improve our hiring, performance management and retention policies. A must read!"
2,Too firm for me....,"I use down pillows and love them . But they tend to lack a little support and you can sink too far into them during the night. And I love my memory foam mattress! I sink into that yet it supports perfectly! So I thought this was a perfect marriage! Well, I don't use it at all. It seems to me the memory foam is really firm unlike my mattress that I sink into. It seems to me that the softness ends real quick once you hit the inner memory foam. The layer of down is small and the inner pillow is kinda big and too firm. If you want a soft pillow you can sink into, this isn't the right one."
1,Mini Pillows,"The pillow quality was fine, but they were about 1/3 the size I would have liked them. Good for kids, maybe, but way too small for me."
1,A waste of time and money,"Waited for this item to arrive, only to find it was damaged and the wrong color. Completely disappointed. Scratches and misalignment galore! Waited a week for a UPS ship back label. Heard from them another week later that my card would be credited during next months statement. Bad deal all the way around. My solution was to buy an assembled bike locally! Consider the same solution if you are thinking about this bike as well. My guess is that you run the risk of disapointment when purchasing an item that needs precision assembly like a bike, and it's shipped around too much. I also suspect less than stellar manufacturing standards with bikes in this price range."
2,becoming less funny here,It is becoming less funny as we go on... I don't think it would be worth 2$ per episode.Oddly they haven't released the DVD yet.
2,"Should be called ""Harley Women of the Road""","This book is beautifully presented, however I felt that it lacked much substance. It gives a one sentence description - at most(with photo) of some female HARLEY riders with the exception of one woman on a Volkswagon trike. Being a Honda rider myself, I felt a little excluded. I thought the book could have given a better cross-section of women riders. I guess I expected more..."
2,Very Disappointed,"I bought this Swiss army watch about 5 years ago through a friend of my dad's that is a jeweler/watch dealer. It was $800 retail or so if I remember correctly and I thought I got a deal at $450ish... Had to replace battery after one year, then the chronograph timer stopped working a few months later. 2 years into ownership and had to pay $275 to completely rebuild watch as everything stopped working suddenly. I got another 2 years out of it before it stopped working again and the inside moves around in the case. I suspect it needs a rebuild again and I am NOT going to do it. Guess it will be a nice light paperweight now. In all fairness I wore it daily and showered, slept etc. with in on. I love the feel and look and its super light, but I have about $700 dollars into a currently non-functional watch. Bummer."
2,"Nice looking, light but mechanism questionable",This watch has the nice features of a solid watch. It has a sapphire crystal and screw back case. It does keep pretty good time and I like the lightness of the titanium band. It also is dressy and rugged enough to wear everyday.There are a few shortcomings though for this price range. The battery died after only one year which is very unusual for a nice watch. When I opened the case I saw that the case was made in China. So much for the swiss made watch. I also noticed the mechanism looked like a cheap sieko watch. When I opened my movado though it was quartz it was still an impressive jeweled mechanism.This watch looks a lot better on the outside than on the inside. For the price I expected a better mechanism and the whole thing to be swiss made. I also wish it had some glow in the dark markers because it's impossible to read in the dark.UPDATE: Died at 18 months. Mechanism is cheap.
5,"""A Dutch Treat""","""Soldier of Orange"" is the story of several young residents of the Netherlands who become involved in World War II. I believe it is the best film directed by Paul Verhoeven - far better than anything he has made since coming to the U.S. from the Netherlands. Rutger Hauer is also excellent in the film. A VHS version of this film was available some years ago in the U.S. but letterboxing brings the film back to its original theater experience. This film is absolutely in my ""Top 10"" of all time list."
3,The Dutch fight back,"This movie revolves around a group of Dutch students in 1939 and the way WWII (and the arrival of the Germans) affected the course of their lives. Several join the Resistance, one joins the SS, others get away to England and join the fight there. Soldier of Orange is a bit graphic in some places but a good war film. There is a strange dance scene at one point and the film moves slowly and unevenly in places but worth it if you can find it."
3,Perfect color.,The color is exactly as described. It was thinner that I would have liked it to be and it doesn't have the suction cup tabs on it to help hold it to the wall to keep the water from escaping the shower area.
5,nice curtain,works well and does what I needed it to do. It is all white as advertised. recommend using this curtain.
3,Well.......,"This is a very large blanket... which I wanted. Looks great when you first use it. HOWEVER, I've neverseen a blanket pill so badly. Little furry balls all over it. So, I washed it once in cold water with Woolite tosee if I could cure it. Dryer filled up with little furry balls. It's warm. It's a blanket. It's made out of somestrange textile and not quite up to expectations on a Faribault product. I've owned and loved many oftheir blankets. This one..... not up to snuff. Unless you collect little green furry things."
5,amazing new group,I have heard several new hip-hop artist lately but these guys are off the chain. Their use of colorful lyrics create an unforgettable experience. I strongly adivice that you don't sleep on this.

4,Great product for the price,"I use to have the Black & Decker ProBlend and it broke after the second use because it could not handle the ice. This one is VERY good and blends anything I put in it, including ice. It is very strong for how light and simple it is and has never leaked. Anyone who gave this a low rating must have a defective unit or missing the gasket.The only negative I can find is that it occassionally has a burning electronics smell if I let it run to long after the ice is turned into a smoothie texture. I think it is because the motor stops having resistance and speeds up too much. This has only happened twice in the several times I have blended ice and only on high speeds."
2,I value the reviews,"I must say I was most disappointed with this item. Before selecting this item, I consulted the reviews as I value the target shopper's opinion . I purchased this item as an anniversary gift for my sister, and must say she and I both were disappointed with its performance. She used the blender (1) time to make a few daiquiri's, and it leaked excessively. Other than the attractive look of this item, there's not much left to say other than SHIP it back to the store."
2,No Hamilton Beach,"I have not used this particular model, but the hamilton beach that I bought (a more expensive model w/ 14 speed) was a complete waste. I tried making alcoholic beverages and it leaked. also, did not crush well."
3,OK,"I miss the old dancers, the old ""home base,"" and the old format! Not as fun as the other DVDs, sorry to say. I love Billy Blanks Jr but I hope he finds his old pals and does another!"
4,Fun and easy to follow,He breaks down the moves so they are really easy to learn and follow along. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the people in the background are really annoying and just trying to show off.
1,Oooops I thought this was the Real Billy Blanks,This will teach me to read better. Not what I was looking for at all. I wanted Tae Bo. Not this. Found Billy's Taebo later and ordered it.
3,Did not meet expectations,"After being so satisfied with our Millers Forge Professional Large Dog Nail Trimmer, I had hoped that this nail file would be just as excellent. Unfortunately, it doesn't really live up to the Millers Forge name. It's very basic and does a mediocre job of smoothing our boxer's nails. I think that a regular emery board would do an equal (or better!) job than this. I'm disappointed but at least it wasn't very expensive."
2,Not worth the money,"I gave this two stars because it arrived quickly. Unfortunately, it does nothing to file the dog's nails. I have to apply so much pressure to even make a slight shaving that I'm hurting the dog. After clipping nails, this won't work at all to round the edges off. Free shipping is nice, but spend a little more and get something that works."
2,Just another dog file,Just another dog file. Didn't make it any easier to finish off nails. Not for large dogs or nails...
5,Pet Nail File,"I saw the vet using this tool with my dog and wanted one to use at home.Of course, my first thought was "" get it from Amazon. ""The company that sold the file was quick to get it to me.Now all I need is a way to keep the dog still."
5,Great for flat arches!,"I hav the regular orthotics, the $200 one & their great, but too bulky for som shoes. Also, i cant buy like 5-6 pairs for each of my running shoes, sinz too costly, so i bought these & they've been great. I bought 6 pairs , so each will last for a year at least, sinz i dont just hav 1 pair for each shoe & it reduces me from havn to keep transferring em for whatever shoe i feel like using on the day i run. Ive been using these types the past 2yrs, their the best in comparison to other brands out there despite the cost, theyre worth it."
4,"Work well, but hold your smell","As a big guy, my feet are under a lot of weight (obviously) and extremely flat. These orthotics help me to ward off plantar fasciitis. I also have very bad knees and these seem to help a bit with that pain too. In sneakers (New Balance) I remove the wimpy insoles and leave these Lynco L420's in permanently. I have another pair of L420's that I switch among my dress shoes and Top Siders. They do seem to ""hold"" your foot odor and I've not tried to determine a means of cleaning them. I use Lysol or similar spray now and then; but when they get too bad, I toss them and buy a new pair. I would have gone for 5 stars if they could be easily laundered or perhaps treated with charcoal smell suppressant."
1,Worst university press book I have ever read,"I was required to read this book in grad school (I was embarrassed for the teacher, since the selection reflects on the selector). It is a genuinely awful book. The style was (for me, at least) indigestible. The main thesis of the book, that *meaning* -- as opposed to bit configurations -- can be *quantified* is not just nonsense, but *frightening* nonsense, since quantifying everything gets funded these days. The book is worth buying if you want to discover how appalling what Joseph Weizenbaum described in his fine book: ""Computer Power and Human Reason: From Judgment to calculation"" can get!"
5,The Last Steel Warrior,"Comprehensive and interesting review of the M14 covering all the aspects leading up to, and throughout it's development. A must for any weapons enthusiast."
4,Power Strip Surge Protection,"Purchased this power strip to separate out an audio/video monitor that was getting a lot of electrical/line feedback through the speakers.Although not removing it completely, the difference is substantially better/improved."
4,Plugs are oriented correctly,"This has the plugs oriented correctly, so you can plug in with out overlapping on other plugs/adapters. Good job guys."
1,I would give zero stars if I could.,"I received a defective model. The red light doesn't work, and the power that gets through is erratic. I tried it in two different wall outlets. It caused flickering in the lamp that I plugged in.However, even if it had worked correctly, I probably would have thought about returning it. Before I realized that it was defective, I tried to plug in the various electronics that I planned to use with it. Granted, I have a wide transformer. It used up its entire space and partially blocked the first regular outlet next to it. I could have lived with that. However, the other outlets are too close together. I could not plug in my laptop's AC cord and my photocopier next to each other. I tried to leave an empty outlet between them in order to plug in a normal lamp, and it did not fit between them. In other words, for me this would have been a 3-outlet surge suppressor, rather than a 6-outlet."
1,Nearly impossible to plug things in,"As a new poorly constructed piece of exercise equipment, this gets 5 stars. As a power strip it's the worst power strip I've ever used. I didn't even know that there was such a thing as a bad power strip.The outlet plugs have metal contacts that are nigh on impossible to actually plug something into. I had to use almost my full weight on each plug to get it to actually plug in. Now that they're plugged in... I guess they're staying plugged in. I might need to cut it apart to get something out--and that's only a slight exaggeration.I don't know that it deserves 1* but seeing as that's the only metric by which I know how to judge a power strip: whether or not you can plug something into it I guess it fails miserably.I almost considered sending it back."
2,choose another product,Not much to say about this product. You need to use extra force to plug in and pull the plug out. It shouldn't be like that.
4,works,"surge suppressor came with the outlets/ contact pins locked, had to brace them open (using a screwdriver). otherwise, works fine. came in good condition."
2,Noise reduction?,"I bought this surge suppressor for one single reason. I have a lot of noise coming through the power lines and my television reciever won't turn on because of it.This surge suppressor seems to have reduced the noise by a tiny fraction. But if you're looking for quality noise reduction, keep looking. This one really doesn't do much."
5,Nice layout for maximum options,This power strip fit my needs perfectly for an area with multiple types of items needing to be pugged in. It provides good space for power cords as well as transformer type plugs.
4,Great deal,I had a particular need for this power strip. I needed the versatility of an offset connector. This worked perfectly.
4,Basic surge suppressor/power strip,"I like the spaced outlet for a power brick adapter as well as the status light for power on. I took a star away for no indication of surge protection, but then in many cases you will pay more for more bells and whistles. Price is reasonable for this device and I would recommend it."
1,Never received the item.,"The item was not received. A credit was issued, but no notice was given and because it was a gift and needed in a timely fashion, I wasn't that happy with the seller."
4,Futurist's notions of the future seem to be accurate,"Dr. Murray's call for a guaranteed annual income is supported by well thought out prospects of the future. He's non-dogmatic, down to earth portrayal of an economy no longer in need of the number of workers it has had in the past, is very convincing. What really appealed to me; however, is that for the most part I came to these same conclusions 20 years ago. Murray's viewpoints are in line with the late Robert Theobald (died Nov., 1999) and Jeremy Rifkin. The difference is that Murray's book is easier understood for the lay person. If you want to get a completely different view point on how welfare should be handled in this country, this book should be of great interest. Even if you don't agree with the author, it makes for great discussions."
2,Not in good condition,"The bind of the book was TAPED together! The seller said it was in good condition, but it is far from being in good condition."
2,"wife is ok with them, i hate them","the feel is of the head squishing into and being surrounded by the pillow material, and the head resting then at an odd angle giving a sore neck by a few hours. i went back to my trusty feather pillow. actually my wife added some feathers from her old feather pillow into mine and now we are both content.given the chance again, i would pass these sealy pillows by, a name brand does not always warrant normal expectations."
3,"Paid $16.99, and they're pretty good","I wanted to wait a few months before reviewing these to see it they would get lumpy like every other pillow and they do, though not too bad. I think this is the fate of all pillow with this type of composition. They are certainly better than an $8 pillow I'd have purchased at my local discounter."
2,ummmm no thank you..................,Ok I was so darn excited about getting these new pillows....well I have had them for probably about a month now and they are flatter then my old pillows which I am sad to say I have already thrown away.....If you like flat pillows then these ar ethe ones for you
2,worst one,"worst buy, i got cheated seeing the brand name, they didnt last long, i used it for two months and i had a to buy a new ones."
3,Small,"I thought it would of been more of a stretch panty hose material but its exactly what it is... a TIGHTS. I wear a 3x and ordered the 4x because im 5' 11'' and it was still a little snug. Its not super stretchy but i DO like the material seeing that it would be harder to strand but i suggest you order up 2 sizes if your tall. If not, One size up should do the trick."
1,Rolled write back down,"No elastic in the top to keep these up. I'm a size 22 woman, and these did not not stay up at all!"
2,Not recommended,I purchased it for a friend and was informed that it was not enjoyable or entertaining. I will not order a product such as this again. But I can assume that the product might be just the thing someone else would want.
4,Science history - top read,For anyone interested in how science got going in the 18th century this is an inspiring story. Most of the characters are now well known if not exactly household names. Highly recommended.
4,Sturdy and well built,"The cooling grid is real handy in and out of the oven.I purchased this rack for roasting chicken.The grid doesn't actually fill half sheet pan,but it is still a useful tool.The quality makes up for the size."
3,Done well and pretty,"I have the Canadian version on VHS tape of this play.I like Helen Mirren's version, but after seeing two versions of this playwith mature women playing the leading role,I'm convinced that a younger maid without a bust and slender hipswould be more convincing. Mirren dressed as boy is still too much of awoman. The Canadian version while not as well in scenes of the outdoorsis better acted in the supporting roles like the fool.This play is one of the best of the comedies."
5,Great tunes and the video is a super bonus,"Shoes off and Run is a great album with an interesting mix of pop, rock and jazzy funk. The CD includes a video of the tune ""Warning"" which is very creative and entertaining. Standout songs include ""Proof"", which has some great multi track harmonies and a melody that will stay with you. ""Orphaned"" has a reflective fusion feel with intriguing levels of meaning. The album features inspired keyboard work throughout, with a really tight, gifted band. The guitar and bass riffs complement Cheryl's voice and compositions really well. The bass emerges as the driver for ""Something Sacred"", which rocks.The entire album rocks! Highly recommended!"
2,Forget About It...,"If you like mixing processed food together and believe the results match those like Bobby Flay, then forget about it. This is a book for people who have trouble boiling an egg. Buy some ramen noodles, some kraft macaroni and cheese, and some Tombstone pizza and save your money instead of buying this trash. If you really want to cook, buy Marcella Hazan, Anthony Bourdain, or even Emeril. BAM! Bam, Bam, Bam! this book in the fireplace!PS 2 stars since it was a Christmas present; it's the thought that counts. That's what I cherish about this gift."
4,I actually became smarter after reading this book ; ),"The book offers a very broad and seemingly unrelated range of information. You read, familiarize yourself with the theory of what is done in the field and afterwards it is very easy to apply the quite interesting information gotten from this book. Inevitably, you would require some more practical (not necessarily detailed) information pertaining to more advanced projects. In this case you will at least know what you are looking for and manage the time and project in a more professional manner."
5,Interesting for Tudor Scholars,"While I wouldn't recommend this book for the casual reader who wants to know more about King Henry VIII, for scholars, it's wonderful to be able to see the original source documents that are so often briefly quoted in biographies."
2,Disappointed!,"I've always enjoyed Rachel Lee's books, and looked forward to the same with ""Wild Card"". Instead, I ended up reading a mix of ""Fahrenheit 911"", campaign speeches, potshots at the Catholic Church, and a variety of conspiracy theories. No one can claim to be completely free of bias, but I'd rather read a book where they are a little more subtly presented, or better yet, non-existent."
4,Swiss Army Watch,"I purchased the men's Victorinox Swiss Army Alliance Date Watch for Amazon.com. The price was right and the item arrived as expected. I enjoy its style and it keeps excellent time. All-in-all, it was a good buy!!"
2,I'm gonna get clobbered here . . .,. . . but I heard this album and it just sounded run-of-the-mill to me. Some of the best music ever made came from the 60s but not this. I don't know why these other reviewers are so crazy about this album. I think they're overrating it big time. Maybe you had to be there when this band was around . . . maybe there's a good reason why this album isn't very well known today.
5,I Was There,"I saw Moby Grape in Washington D.C. at the stripped down Ambassador Theatre in 1968. This largely unknown band just blew everyone away. Jerry Miller's guitar sang and Bob Mosely's bass hummed with a ferocity and beauty you wouldn't believe. They were so tight and way ahead talent wise of other rock bands such as Earth and Crosby, Stills, and Nash. The genius of that brief period was the raw musical imagination that Moby Grape demonstrated. When I collected follow on albums, the magic was largely missing, and they disappeared into obscurity. But with this great one, who cares? The cover shows Skip Spence's ""finger."" Columbia recalled the album to airbrush out the ""vulgarity."" Lucky for me, my origianl album has the original, and CD owners obviously see what once they couldn't."
5,One of the Greatest Albums of the 60's!,"I was a teenager and well-versed in the music of my era when this album was released. I can't begin to convey how fresh and exciting Moby Grape sounded! They blended so many genres so well and so seamlessly. All five members wrote, arranged, played and sang as well as any of their peers. This CD is the perfect introduction for new listeners of all ages. Recommended without any reservations!"
5,One of the true classics,"I've followed Moby Grape from the beginning when my big brother brought home the album with the controversial cover. This is a must is anyone's collection. The music was new and innovative back then and stands up to today. Each track is performed with passion and fondly reminds me of how records were made in those days - loose and not so much emphasis on perfection. I even included my personal favorite, 8:05, on my own CD, http://www.CDBABY.com/cd/johnpalermo."
5,moby grape (1st LP),"This band influenced the sound and style of the byrds,and crosby-stills-nash-young,and other bands following the great 60's rock explosion.I'd put this one in my top 100 list of great rock albums."
2,"Historical, perhaps, but poorly done.","Moby Grape was an offshoot of the ""San Francisco"" scene...much like Peter Wheat and the Breadmen...originators to some extent but misunderstood by the record companies...This album (their first) is chopped up into 45s, and lacks the cohesion of a live concert, and thus the feel of the genre, Big Brother's first album is another example of the marketing clumsiness of the record companies in the 60s...The alternative of the time was the FM dial, and this piece is unfortunately geared towards the AM play lists of the era...Remember when the second printing of the cover came through, the ""finger"" on the washboard was missing. ""WOW"", flawed though it is, is a much better representation of what these guys were capable of, and ""Truly Fine Citizen"" (out of print) certainly their best."
3,Unfortunate encroaching numbness,"Unfortunately the late 60's San Fran scene, of which Moby Grape is said to be a huge part, has all but become sterile with decades upon decades of derivative watering down, retarding my appreciation and emotional impact to much of the textbook, though diverse classic psych material. And though I cannot ascertain, in my youth, exactly which musical elements were borrowed and which were borrowed from (and I'm positive both apply at least a little) there are at least a fraction of tracks that have not seemed to solidify into musty relics and actually hint at why the group is cited so highly."
3,entertaining,"at first is didnt like this album too much, but it is good, although they dont jam, the songs are short and fun."
5,AN TRULY UNDERRATED 60'S CLASSIC,"I'm probably much younger than the majority of the Moby Grape fans out there,but all i can say is that this is one of the greatest albums to ever be released.I'm 18 years old and have been listening to the grape for about 2 1/2 years now and they are definatley one of my favorite bands, and I listen to alot of music from that time. Not many bay area groups from that time period were as consistant as the grape were.This first album contains everything from blues and folk to psychedelic and pure rock and roll.Guitarist jerry miller is one hell of a musician who sounds like bb king when he plays his guitar.Visionary band leader skip spence also wrote some of the grapes and the jefferson airplanes best songs and released an underground epic titled Oar prior to his departure in 68'.I gaurantee if you like 60's music you will not be disapointed will this album."
2,"exellent musicians, putrid sounding cd.","This album deserves better. The songs are good, the players are exceptional---BUT----the cd version that I aquiredin October,2005 sounds just like the tinny AM transisterradios that we folks born between 1960-1970 rememberfrom dayz of yore. I suggest you assure yourself of somesort of remaster version before you spend your hard earned$. This version ok only if you want to recall the bedroom/earpiece (remember the manilla colored earpiece that came w/the radio) experience. It is a shame this versionwas allowed to slip through. ,"
4,Someone has to explain why this is so expensive...,"Just makes no sense to me. Yea, the songs on this one great Grape recording are fun to listen to once in a while, but the price is just silly. Me, I burned a disc from my old vinyl. Great sound--I bet you could find a clean vinyl copy for $2-$3. The songs never sounded better, and after a few listens I was able to retire it to my shelf. In two years, I'll dig it out, listen to it once or twice, and put it away again. Great music is great, but being fleeced by music management has nothing going for it."
5,a truly great album,"one of the greatest albums of all time, and definitely the best to come out of the bay area in the late 60's.every time i listen to this album i like it more and more.i was lucky to find a new vinyl copy which makes it all the better.skip spence is a true genius and the bands true visionary not to mention a fellow Canadian(windsor, ontario).songs like indifference,8:05 and ain't no use are true classics.this band was so much different than other bay area bands of the time as it preffered to write structured songs as opposed to free form jams.this album is a must have if you enjoy music from the area as i do..."
2,Buy Listen my Friends instead,"Loved Moby Grape, but this is just way to over priced for a non re-engineered i.e. not digitally done cover of the LP. Go with the Listem my Friends greatest hit cd, it's cheaper with most of the songs on it. Or if you are hard core get the 2003 Europe double CD, Its pricey, but so is this and you get mostly everything plus some extras."
5,This text ia a very good start for beginners in C and C++.,"This book seems to have been written primarily as a college text. It offers thoughful insite to the absolute basics which is refreshing since many texts on this subject often assume that the reader has at least an intermediate knowledge of programming. Buy this book before moving on to ""Teach Yourself C in 21 Days"" . As a budding programmer myself, I highly recommend this book.Jsalas"
1,Banana Splits Adventure Hour,"The Entire series is available from 'FantasticToons dot com' 31 episodes on 4 discs. Not sure why it's not available on Amazon. They also have a load of other otherwise unavailable Toons - like, Tex Avery!! The Whole MGM years.. Check it ;P"
4,Lots of Topless Scenes,The young girl is topless through most of the movie. Most of the time you only get quick glimpses as her hair covers most everything up. Good mini skin flick!
2,Laine Jungle Goddess,Not that great of a story very thin this is a B-Movie. Kind of disapointed in this one some what like a female Tarzan taken out of the jungle.Jerry Sebastian
3,Granny's view,This item was a bit disappointing as it was not as sturdy as it looked on the site before buying
3,Kids like it,"The kids all like it--age 2, 3 & 7. I think it's a little hard to fold up, but it looks durable. The kids mostly enjoy shooting the water."
4,Mellow vibin' smash by Craig David,"With a vibe which takes me back to Janet Jackson's ""That's the Way Love Goes"", Craig David-already loved by millions in Europe, is bursting onto the American scene. The insatiable groove of ""Seven Days"" is sweet which has my friends reciting the days of the week with their fingers. Is Craig David a star? Certainly speaking from ""Born to Do It""-Wake up America-Craig David has arrived and it won't be long until he covets the top of the charts. This is real talent-on the mark-NO DOUBT!!!"
4,Great insight to the Nadar Community to the Young generation,"It is a great book, which gives the picture of how nadars grown because of their unity among themselves and helping their community in all their causes.It is a must for every nadar to read this Book,If you are a Nadar you have to have this book,If you are not, it is a great book to read about the community which came up to the higher economy status by their sheer hardwork, Dedication and their self formed Organisation support."
3,List could have been better,"Well, it's a decent CD. I recommend tracks 1,3,6,8, and 10. But never have been a big fan of Lil Suzy. And I agree with oriental. Nocera had an exagerrated spanish accent and thus ruined the song. Cynthia and Monet are the only true old school here. And Tiana is a strong second. But the rest is average or subpar. There are far better compilations then this."
2,"good product, not for me","I like tea tree oil products, but this product caused me more irritation instead of less. It seemed to be a good quality lotion anyway, so I am able to use it in areas not as easily irritated."
1,poorly made,"1. Battery life is closer to 4 hours than the 9 claimed.2. Lockups occured frequently during playback from day 1 and were most frequent when battery power was anywhere less than full.3. Menu button is awkward and unreliable, frequently sticking or not activating the desired function.4. The unit failed completely after 6 weeks of very sheltered use and will no longer power up at all.5. Most local stores which did stock the companion no longer do.6. The SanDisk website shows no warrantee information link for this product and attempts to obtain return authorization end in an endless loop."
1,You will be glad when it breaks (and it will),This is a fairly bulky/heavy Mp3 player made of the cheapest plastic imaginable. The switches are barely attached. The battery lid broke off within a month. But you will be glad when it breaks because the interface is complex (You won't be using this one without squinting at the LCD screen) and it's buggy too.Don't waste your time or money.
1,MP3 companion is junk,"I tried two of these units from the same store, and both of them failed to lock down the battery cover, so never got to hear what they sound like.The battery cover is poorly designed, flimsy and cheaply manufactured.If I could, I'd send SanDisk a bill for my gas and time wasted driving back to get a replacement for the first unit. When the second failed, I just took a refund and left."
2,SanDisk MP3 Companion,Summary:I use it with a 1GB memory stick and if it didn't lockup all the time it would be a cool little product. As it stands it's not worth the money.Pro:Sounds great.Light weight.Allows me to switch drives for different music.Battery life lasts about a day.Con:Locks up for no reason.Poor construction of the battery cover (thin bit of plastic holding on the cover).
1,Constant fat error and freezing,seems like sandisk didnt put much thought into this device. it very cheaply made and i know it will not last me very long. but at 40.00 one year is well worth it. my main probelm is the amount of power it takes to read a flash drive. it will not read the flash card once the battery is half used. There goes the cost of the mp3 player. looks like i will be joining the masses soon and buy an i-pod
1,Don't waste your time...,"SanDisk's mini-cruzer jump drive works beautifully as a storage device...and that's wonderful, but SanDisk is a pro at making portable storage...not digital audio players.I purchased this despite the negative reviews, only to find that everything was true...the player skips on audio files that play perfectly fine on the PC and it will freeze when you try to move to another track.There is no way to shuffle the tracks or create a playlist...this player is even worse than early-generation MP3 devices. I felt like I was going to break it."
1,Good idea - if they fix it,"Beside the problems with the shuffle, music quality etc. the extraordinary cheap construction had to be duct taped to hold the unit together after a few tries by my 16 year old.Great idea - poor quality.If you've read this far and are still thinking of buying it - make sure you can return it, or the pieces."
3,Good news? New firmware available!,"I am afraid to buy a Cruzer Companion because of so many complains about freeze, play sorting and other functioning problems. But I think that should be interesting for those who bought it, that Sandisk released a firmware update on 07/28/2004, to improve the performance of the player. Maybe the major issues were solved with this latest firmware.[...]For instructions to update it's better to see Sandisk customer support page. I hope this could be helpfull for those suffering Sandisk Companion owners.Should be great if someone test this upgrade and post an updated review!"
2,Not compatible with USB driverSanDisk SDCZ4-512-A10 512 MB,"This is an acceptable product. Not excellent, but not bad at all either.The only problem I had so far is very simple:No matter what they might tell you, this mp3 player is not compatible with the USB driver : SanDisk SDCZ4-512-A10 512 MB Cruzer Micro.It is been offered together here in Amazon.com, although they are not compatible.I made the mistake of buying both and after getting a consistent Fat error message I found out that any USB driver with less capacity will work, but the one with 512 mb capacity will never function. The mp3 player by itself can be a 4 star category item, but San disk has no idea about customer service and their websites do not help anyone to find out the information to fix situations like this."
2,SanDisk has a good warranty return policy,"I can not add any thing new that other reviewers have stated about this product. My player had all of the issues stated from other reviewers. The headphone jack on my unit became so intermittent that I had to send mine back for replacement. SanDisk replaced my player with a Sansa m230 because the Companion was no longer in production (no surprise there). Turn around time was quick and they paid the shipping both ways. So if your Companion is no longer working, SEND IT BACK!"
1,useless,"Erratic and unpredictable behaviour. Stops playing and/or turns ifself off after a few minutes. Sometimes returns a message ""insert micro cruzer"" when cruzer is already inserted and has been recognized. Reinserting cruzer has no effect. This device is totally worthless."
4,A very innovative product!,"I must say that in it's time, this product was really very innovative. Imagine playing music off a USB drive! I have used it with the matching Cruzer Micro USB drive for hours of music and entertainment. Although the audio output is nowhere close to audiophile quality, it does a reasonably nice job and a nice toy to have."
1,Worse than I though,"Don't buy this, it will just disappoint. After writing my old review, I discovered that the custom EQ was screwy (it nearly halved the volume of ""normal""). I asked about it on Sandisk's site. Later that same day, it began crashing on me after every 3-5 songs. I asked about it on the site (added to old question), I also sent it back to amazon for replacement hoping it was defective.That was 8/27, today is 9/2 and I finally got a response. After asking about why the EQ volume halved and why it started crashing so much, they replied and told me.....to look at the FAQ about ""How does the Cruzer Micro MP3 companion order the songs it gets from the Micro?"" What is that? I wait almost a week for something wholly and completely unrelated to what I asked?Their service stinks, the player is barely usable, stay away (I know I wish I had)."
2,Beware!,Plays songs quite nicely but beware; Will Not Accept usb flash memory cards from any other manufacturer. Even though they fit perfectly into the player it rejects them saying Insert Valid Cruzer Micro.So don't think you can use your existing usb flas memory sticks from other makers!
3,It ok MP3,I have the update rom when i bought it ver 1.1.0it froze like everytime i scroll through the songs to find the right one.yea and the battery cover suck mine broke and today is the first time i used it.
2,okay player when works...but too many bugs...,"I totally agree with ""Reviewer: Stereo Batman"" about some of the flaws in this players. I experienced the same problems. The most annoying problem is the constant freezing, which forces me to pull out the battery and put it back in, which doesn't help the battery cover at all since it will eventually losen or break because of such terrible design.It's an okay mp3 player if it works.It's a very nice idea/invention, but has too many problems needed to be fixed."
1,Cannot close battery cover,I cannot close the battery cover ! Belt clip must be used.It is brand new.
2,POS is too good of a word for this,The battery cap broke after replacing the battery. Kept freezing during play. I had never been robbed like this in my entire life
1,Just plain awful,"Sorry, Sandisk. This thing just doesn't make it. I returned the first one under warranty because the battery door wouldn't stay shut. I was hoping the replacement unit would have a better closure for the battery, but it's the same awful design (TINY plastic tabs to hold the door shut, and they shear off at the slightest provocation!).The second unit refuses to recognize the Sandisk Micro USB drive. I can't get it to play at all, and this is right out of the box!To be avoided at all costs! I'll never buy another or recommend this unit to anyone."
1,Cruzer Micro 4 GB model doesn't fit!,"I never saw anywhere in the description of the product or on the label that the 4 GB, slightly larger model of the Cruzer Micro wouldn't fit in the Mp3 Companion. So I was pretty disappointed when it arrived in the mail and I couldn't even try it. I assumed that in all the pictures of the product that they were showing the 512 MB model of the flash drive just because they felt like it, not because it was the only one that fit! The product description needs to be more clear about which Cruzer Micro models will fit as obviously not all of them do."
2,Freezes often,"When I purchased the Cruzer Mp3 companion, it was swell, but after a week or so, the headphones started to fall apart, and the device started to freeze. Now, it freezes almost every 5 songs.Pros: interesting conceptCons: bad/cheap design.buy an iPod or something else instead.FREEZES VERY FREQUENTLY"
1,Deception,"That was one of the worst things I ve bought in my life. It stoped working in less than 2 hours. everytime I turn it on, a message of FAT Error is showed on the display and it automatically turns off. Unfortunately I'm in Brazil now (I will stay for more 12 mounths)and therefore i won't be able to make the change.Could you help me?"
1,Bad Product,"I bought this product because I thought that using a flash disk with an MP3 player was a great idea. I still think it's a great idea.This player, I must say, is terrible. I don't have much experience with MP3 players, but when it freezes up every three songs, it's not a good product. I'd rather use a portable CD player!I've had these problems despite downloading all the latest firmware updates. Customer support's solution is - ""don't use the shuffle mode."" Even in normal mode, it's constantly freezing up between songs. I thought Sandisk was better than this!"
1,Lots of freeze ups,"Update: I got a new player from the RMA process which took a month. The new player does not lock up! But after a couple of months the battery cover will not stay closed. Now I guess I will have to RMA again and see if the fouth unit works. Unbelievable....Like others, I have experienced many lock ups. I returned it and got another that was a little better but still locks up. Sent it to SanDisk on RMA and am hoping to get a functional player."
3,The battery cover is not tight enough,"Another reviewer has already gave us a very complete, honest and sexy review.Just an additional comment to his comments - the battery cover is not designed well. During my first five day use, the cover has come down about three time during my Gym time (very light movement such as jogging). Very annoying.I decide to ask Amazon.com to replace one for me. If the new one will still have the problem, I will then throw away my 50 bucks and let it collect dust at the corner of my drawer."
5,An outstanding alternative to monte carlo simulation,"The first four or five chapters of this book explain in detail the statistical analysis technique WCA+. The text is easy to read and requires only a limited probability and statistics background to understand how to apply the technique. The remaining chapters give concrete examples from the electrical engineering field. As a mechanical engineer I found the first few chapters very helpful and I have applied the technique successfully many times. Statistical design engineering is a must today and the WCA+ method is an excellent alternative monte carlo simulation. If you are concerned with the response of your system at the extreme values of the inputs then, this book is a must because monte carlo simulation just doesn't suffice."
3,Probably a guy thing,"After reading Hummingbird's Daughter I became a big fan of Luis Urrea. His writing is so lyrical and evocative. This book disappointed me a little, as I could not relate as much to the characters and their situation. I did read it through, though, which I will not do if I really don't like a book ... life is too short to waste time with a book you are not enjoying. I kept thinking that it Snow is more of a man's story."
3,Book 2 of Lady Knightley's Secret,"This is more a story of Elizabeth and Richard or Hetty and Perry than Lady Jane and Dr Carrington. If you have read Lady Knightley's Secret, then it is nice to see what happened to Elizabeth, Richard and Dr Carrington 3 years later. Otherwise the interaction between the two main characters seemed superfacial. If not for their friends and the aunt, I suspect that the romance would come to its natural death ! To me, the side plots and supporting characters were much more interesting."
5,Good Receipes,"I love these cookbooks and wish they'd put out more ""country receipes"" so I could add to my collection. A+"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,This book is a joke. Although my son likes it... the pictures are very blurry and look like someone glued them and made copies of it at kinkos. I would maybe pay 3.00 tops for it.
3,Rough Guide is a Little Rough,"I bought this because the book touted itself as a way to find those out of the way places that the usual travel books don't tell you about.I have read this book, and I learned nothing new -- no restaurants, accommodations, attractions, etc. that I hadn't known about already. So in this regard it was a disappointment.However, it is a good basic primer about things Barbadian. There are, however, some good, detailed maps. It is also a ""pocket"" book, small in size, so you could easily bring it with you to Barbados and use as a reference.However, I also read Harry P.'s book on Barbados. It is much more thorough and also pretty portable. In my opinion, if you need one book on Barbados, this one probably wouldn't be it."
1,silly book,"Great value from the seller as far as shipping, but the book was not great. I would not purchase from this seller again."
2,Not amazed,"My 18-month daughter is currently thrilled with fish, so I've been searching for fish picture books. This one did not really thrill me as the photo quality is not optimal and it has more pictures of coral and other reef creatures than fish. Maybe it will be more interesting in a couple of years for her."
5,This Book Saved My Family,"I read a book review of books written about raising children and John Rosemond was mentioned in passing in another person's book being reviewed. The power of these few sentences prompted me to look him up and I discovered TEEN PROOFING just before my oldest (of three boys) reached his 14th birthday. This book saved my family. I was not parenting effectively and John Rosemond straightened me (and my husband) out. Mr. Rosemond's no-nonsense ""this is what's so"" approach to directing teens is fabulous. As a result of following Mr. Rosemond's advice All three of my sons follow our rules, accept consequences and do what they are told almost all of the time. This includes housework, homework and work-work. We have family meetings, reasonably clear communications and respect for each other's commitments. I am truly grateful to John Rosemond for this book and I recommend it to any parent with teens."
5,Fantastic Book,This is a fantastic book with great idea's. My wife and I are going to implement many if not all of the idea's that are suggested. They all seem like they will be highly effective and will handle many of the problems we are or will be facing.
5,Great book!,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a no-nonsense guide to effective but fair discipline. The humorous writing style also helps make it an entertaining read. I have already begun to adjust my attitude in approaching my 13 year old, and the results are good. I could live without the Christian references in the book, but the author does give a nod to other beliefs as well."
5,Israel-Palestine Conflict,"Prof. Norman Finkelstein's book debunks several of the historical myths. Some of the these concern the origin of the state of Israel, whose most ignominious episodes were the ethnic cleansing and destruction of hundreds of Palestinian villages in 1948. Other myths concern the nature of Palestine before the arrival of Zionist settlers, which Zionists try to portray as ""a land without a people."" To debunk these myths Finkelstein analyses in detail Benny Morris's Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem and Joan Peters's From Time Immemorial. In a few pages Finkelstein manages to prove that Peters is an intellectual fraud. One must admire his stamina for plowing through a mediocre text replete with distortions and fabrications. Most mortals would throw the book away after a few pages, but Finkelstein didn't stop until the last footnote - and there are 120 pages of these!"
2,5 star book by a fine scholar,"This is an excellent book that has the courage to tell the truth about the creation of Israel. And what infuriates the Zionists the most is that it is by a Jewish scholar whose family suffered during the Holocaust. Not some ""anti-Semite"" who could be smeared and dismissed. I give the book five stars but for some reason Amazon's website will onlly register two. It's a five star book."
4,Good arguments,"While the book is highly critical of Israel (and only Israel) and might seem a bit one-sided, I found his analysis of the accepted history of the region as quite refreshing. He provides a wealth of evidence and sources to back himself up and his explanations seem quite genuine. I regret the fact that it only goes up until the Yom Kippur war though, he would be well advised to make some more additions to this otherwise interesting book."
5,Another good one from Mr. Finkelstein,"I have read several of Professor Finkelstein's boooks, and have enjoyed them all. There is so little objective writing on the subjects that he tackles. Few people are as honest and downright brave as this author. Bravo."
5,One of the best,"This courageous book is one of the best I have read about the Israel-Palestine conflict. The book's strength is how thoroughly researched and documented it is.Finkelstein uses numerous direct quotes and footnotes from a vast variety of sources, ranging from official records to the personal diaries of Israeli leaders. He does not spare anyone, and he debunks quite a few popular myths about Israel's birth.This book is thought-provoking and while some of the chapters can hardly be called an easy read, it a must read for anyone who is interested in the truth about the Middle East."
1,It vilifies but does not inform,"Mr Finkelstein is so obsessed with vilifying Zionism (which he compares to Nazism) that he never even tries to discover what Zionism is.Zionism is a movement of national liberation and has all the attributes of such a movement.Had Mr. Finkelstein paused to consider this, he might have realized that Zionism may be clashing with another movement of national liberation. If he had done so, his book might have been at the least honest.As it is, he is so busy vilifying Zionism and praising everything and anything opposed to this evil straw man he has set up in his mind, that he is simply incapable of writing a scholarly work on this conflict.A pity because he is obviously a gifted writer."
1,Total propaganda for Arafat's point of view - worthless,"This book could as well be written by Arafat or any other [...] trying to justify their crimes. Spin, omissions and just plain lies. This book gives new meaning to the word bias. Skip it, unless you cust crave more of the left leaning anti Israeli propaganda."
5,Positively Refreshing!,"I think this CD is a great idea! I am a parent who has noticed several teachers looking drained and overworked. I bought this CD to give to the teachers of my children. I feel better sending my children to school knowing they are being taught by teachers who are positive and refreshed. This CD isn't just a gift for the teacher, but a gift for the whole class!"
2,DONT ORDER if you dont have plastic connector piece,There is a plastic connector piece that is attached to the bag and that is what attaches to the blower. If you dont have that piece from your original bad then this bag will do you no good. The opening where that piece connects just has a zip tie on it. It will not work for the blower alone. It doesnt specify that in the product description.
4,Make sure you keep the plastic piece that connects to the blower,I was glad I read the other reviews here because I almost chucked the entire old bag in the trash when the zipper failed. Make sure you keep the plastic neck that connects to the blower. This comes with a new zip tie to connect the replacement bag. They should be very clear about this but they aren't.
3,Leaf Blower Vacuum Bag,"I have had tons of leaves these year and my Toro leaf Blower itself does an excellent job. However, I need to constantly replace the bag becuas ehte zipper comes off the track. So far this Toro bag is good.But I know before the season is over here, I will need to replace it with a new one."
3,good replacement,I was happy to find this Toro Blower Vac replacement bag. It is the same quality as the original at a lesser price than at the Toro site.
4,Better than original,My original bag was poorly made. The zipper was cheap. This bag is better made than the original.
4,Works,"This is a good replacement. The quality is pretty good, and I didn't have to buy a whole new blower."
1,you'll have to jerry rig this to get it to work.,"It comes with a cheap plastic tie to connect the bag to your blower. Once tightened, you can't loosen it. I had to cut it off. Now I have to go to the hardware store and find some way to secure it. What a piece of junk."
1,"Easy broken canvas, zipper head sucked by vacuum itself then broke","The machine is under power, can not vacuum/suck out the pile of leaves, also difficult suck wet leaves on floor. When I clean yard, the pine nut always stop the vacuum working.On the bad side, it is NOT made by durable canvas! The corner of the bag usually easily smashed and broken to small hole, makes the munlched leaves debris flying all over, of course over my hair, face, and body!The zipper is a cheap stuff, one day I heard a crank sound when I running machine, and instantly large leaves debrii comes out, made ash all over my body! I instantly stop the machine and check it, found the zipper head disappeared, it must be sucked into bag.$25 piece junk for this bag, almost cost 50% of the blower!"
4,"Get's the job done, but not original part","""Misplaced"" the original bag that came with the blower/vac and couldn't find a replacement in the neighborhood big-box hardware stores, so decided to order from Amazon. Slightly disappointed that the description doesn't mentaion that it's not exactly like the original. This replacement bag does not have the snap-on attachment that connects to the vac. Instead, there's a cheap plastic tie (similar to those used in electrical work) that you adjust to your vac's size. just becareful not to over tighten or you'll have to replace the tie."
3,There is a different Toro part that has the plastic connector with it.,"I didn't buy this, but after some research I thought I would pass on that Toro part #108-8994 has the the plastic connector tube with the bag all as one piece. It is called a ""bag assembly"". This part I am talking about has both the plastic connector tube and the bag. I got mine at a local Toro dealer or you can google the part number."
1,Toro Vac Relacement bag,"The Toro Comapny needs to put better zippers in the Toro Bags. They are very weak and blow out and break in one season forcing you to buy another bag. I bought this bag and removed the zipper and went to a Piece Good Store and bought a Industrial Zipper and had it sewn in. The bag has now held up several seasons. Consider it a throw away bag at a big expense. Toro you need to improve the zipper, this bag is trash. Hope your listening."
3,Easy to install but disappointed I had to replace it,"I had the leaf vacuum for about a year (bought it at Home Depot I think) before the bag ripped next to the zipper. At first, I was worried that I would have to replace the whole vacuum and then I found the replacement bags on Amazon. The bags are easy to remove and install. Just wish the first one had lasted a bit longer."
2,Over priced.,It's over priced. It's just a canvas bag. It doesn't come with the plastic connector that hooks the bag to the blower. The zipper broke on my original and the replacement cost was $25. It's literally just a couple of yards of heavy canvas and a long zipper. Removing the old bag from the connect was difficult because the manufacturer really did a good job making a tight fit around the neck.The bag is ok but not worth $25.
2,Toro Replacement Bags,"Toro bags normally don't last for the duration of the ""leaf season"". Usually the zipper goes bad first. If not that, then the bag tears around the intake area. I always keep an extra bag on hand because you never know when the thing is gonna fail...."
2,Zipper separating from bag,Used 5 times and the zipper is already separating from the bag. Original bag lasted much longer than this one
1,Ouch,"Full of showy metaphor and stylistic cuteness. (Example: ""Try to parse it, and it's hasta la vista, bubela."" Ugh.) A really painful read that undercuts its own intent. Suggest the AP Guide to News Writing instead."
5,This album is amazing. For the dark at heart,The other review here says it best. And is completely right. This album is essential.
4,intriguing,"If the basic ""facts"" are real, the book has some very interesting consequences. Christians may not appreciate the clear conclusions."
2,not exactly what i hoped for,"i am indeed a lingerie addict....and i in particular have a thing for shelf bras and was looking for a more affordable pick to satisfy my shelf bra addiction....but this one is the worst i own so far.....the material is really thin and it looks satin in the pic, but its stretch polyester...i prefer a good half cup, but this one is just the wires and an inch of stretch fabric....so you dont get a good lift and shape like with a better shelf bra.....i guess i kinda knew this was going to turn out to be a get what you pay for bra set.the panty is useless for me and the strings hang weird on me, but i didnt buy it for the panty...and the pasties are cute.... it still is ok i guess, but not at all what i wanted in a shelf bra.... if youre gonna spend 10 dollars on one thats ok...why not spend 20 on one that looks good....i wish i did.....now ill be out 30. ;)"
2,It's all how you look at it,"These scissors are of Grade C to D quality. But the Price is Grade C (that is, quite low and good), too. So the ratio of price to quality is overall passing. You're not getting german grade stainless steel here, and neither does the description say you are. The feel in the hand is ""old style Japanese"" i.e. when everything that came from Japan was tinny; and the blades are not very sharp. Professionals will definitely not be able to use these. The question is whether an individual can throw this in the home / travel first aid pouch and expect it to work for those infrequent jobs for which it gets used. In my opinion the Jury is truly out on that, and you should have a backup plan."
3,Stainless Steel Scissor,These kinds of scissors you can find all over the hospital. But if you must buy a pair of scissors these steel ones work great. i have had no complaints.
3,I had a hard time getting to the end...,"This book started out good but lost my interest somewhere in the middle. The only thing that kept me going was that I was curious how the author was going to pull off a happy ending. I really liked Elaine but was annoyed off and on by Burton. It was just a so-so story. Girls, don't let the cute guy on the cover fool you!"
2,Barely got through this one,"I made it through this book by peeking ahead, then going back and ""slogging"" my way through. It was an interesting premise that Burton comes seconds after Lady Elaine's wedding to another and claims ""prima nocta"" a medieval notion of ""first night"" rights to Elaine. But I found Burton to be rather cruel and did not feel any compassion for his seeking vengence against an innocent woman. This book just did not hold my attention."
3,"It's OK, I suppose","but they didn't put any dimensions in the listing, and it looked the right size, but alas, it was slightly too large. They could have put the dimensions on the listing and saved me the grief."
5,A nice change-of-pace Christmas story,"A delightful Christmas story that emphasizes giving of oneself and pokes a little fun at commercialism. Mr. Putter is as ""light and airy"" (or light and HAIRY as my five-year-old points out in chapter 4) as ever. Mr. Putter teaches us that we are never too old to learn!"
3,It's okay,"So the reason I gave this toy 3 stars is because it's my dog's FAVORITE toy. We got it when she was just a puppy and a year later, she still brings the toy to bed with her. The sound is children laughing - she didn't seem too interested in that, however she did rip apart the toy and now you can't really tell it's a koala bear. She's only about 8lbs, and a pretty moderate chewer/ripper aparter of toys (to get to the squeaker and noise parts of toys), so it's not really that durable."
1,"""Voice"" lasted about a half hour","I'm glad others have had a good experience with this toy, but unfortunately, mine has been just the opposite. While the toy is undoubtedly cute, and has a delightful giggle, my little koala stopped giggling after just about a half hour. My dog is a 40 lb. mix, and is NOT an aggressive chewer, but the sound mechanism inside the toy is hard and box-like, and it doesn't take much to chomp down on it, essentially rendering it useless.My now mute koala is now going straight into the trash. My dog will not be interested unless the toy makes a noise.$7 and change for a half hour's worth of doggie fun. Not happy. Will not be buying another Multipet Look Who's Talking Toy."
2,Adorable - but problems,"Well, since this is a relatively inexpensive toy, I bought him the koala after the talking chimp broke in two days. The koala only lasted one day. I got it last night at 5 pm, and it's 9 am and it's done talking. I knew when I bought it that it may not last long, but less than 24 hours is a little annoying. Yes, I have a big dog (boxer), so yes, he chews. But, still, one day of working is not okay. There has to be a way to make these things last longer!! My dog found an old 'my little pony' talking horse from when my kids were little and he plays with that really roughly. It talks, it's big, it hasn't broken yet, and I'm gonna stick with that. So, I'm done buying the multi-pets talking things. If they could make them more sturdy, big dogs could enjoy them for more than a day."
2,Look Who's Talking Koala Dog Toy has a child's giggle,"The toy was a bit smaller than I expected, which is fine. The thing my pups & I didn't like was the noise. My pups have loved the other Look Who's Talking toys because of the noises they make (cow=moo, etc). This one has a child's giggle/laugh as the noise. I've been diligent in teaching my fluffy kids to play nice & gentle with human kids, especially not putting their mouths anywhere on a human (unless giving kisses as asked). My pups won't play with this toy because the child's giggle & I'm not inclined to give it to them. I don't want my pups associating a child's noise with something to bite."
2,"Good Organizational Behavior Lessons, but a boring read...","I've read worse text books than this, but this isn't exactly a page turner either.It gives a good feeling for the group dynamics and associated politics of a highly traditioned sport (Yachting) being ""invaded"" by the concept of a women's team that could compete on the mens' level.""Do they try to keep it 100% female (to make a point), or allow a man or two on the crew and increase their chances of winning?"" Suddenly, roles and goals that were not clearly defined at the beginning of this adventure are causing stress and confusion.Interesting, but not riveting..."
3,It is what it is,"It's a math program ... I wouldn't have ordered it if I didn't have to, simply because I hate math. But, since I'm required to take math for my college degree program, this serves the purpose."
1,expedited shipping was a joke,"my issue is not with the product. the peel off strip was half off so it looked at first as if it were used, but it ended up being new thank goodness. my main compalaint is with the shipping. i paid for expedited shipping the morning of tues. 9/11/12 the estimated arrival was either 9/13 to 9/14. it did not arrive until monday 9/17/12. i would not have paid for the extra amount if i had known that it would be late. and i missed my first assignment which was due sunday nite for class because i was not able to start without student kit. i am not sure if i will buy a book from this seller again, if i do it will be when there is no deadline for anything."
4,Hard to find,"I like to play with old technology .... had a pcmcia ""CLICK!"" drive and wanted to mes around ... these discs worked fine and were in good condition and the price was right ....."
3,Interesting...loses it at the end,"This book is the first half of the story of Humility Garden. It is continued in ""Delta City"". Humility is an ordinary rural youngster who doesn't quite fit in with her family. When her brother is selected to be given to the decadent other-worldly rulers, she follows him to the big city. She quickly discovers that the honor of her brother's sacrifice by the ghostiers is a mockery and that her culture is stagnated and top-heavy. Revolution follows.The setting up of this story is wonderful. The ghostiers are interesting and disfunctional. Once Humility gets in over her head it gets dull and political. I didn't bother reading Delta City, however this book was worth it for the ghostiers alone, and I'm glad I read it."
3,a unique story...,"This one is different from most fantasy books; it doesn't fit the mold, and that is a plus. This is not a black/white good/bad sort of world, the politics of Salt are something different. While reading it, I had a hard time liking the main character, and the plot sometimes went beyond the strange to the silly. But by the end the author succeeds because the world she creates is interesting enough that I can't imagine how this will all work out."
4,An astounding first book.,"Felicity Savage has managed to conjure up a highly fanciful world,that remains strangely familiar in its heroine's all-too human emotions.Sudden jumps in the story, not to mention the constant addition of new charactersalso make for great reading.When does the sequel come out?"
4,surreal and fascinating,Felicity Savage is like Tanith Lee in more ways than simplybeginning her writing career early. Her work is fascinating and chewyduring a period where many nw fantasy writers are going for novels that read like an epic adventure film.
5,You never know where a story can lead,"I liked the author's idea of having a book in which story beginnings come alive and tales have to play out to finish. This is a well-written young adult or middle school book. I originally planned to read it as a bedtime story for my six year old daughter, but discovered some elements that would have been too frightening for her. Instead, I read it for myself and really enjoyed it. I'll recommend it to her when she's a bit older."
4,The Book of Story Beginnings,"The Book of Story Beginnings is a great mystical book about a girl named Lucy Martin. She finds a mysterious book that brings every story beginning to life. One story beginning she wrote whisks her off to a new land in which she encounters with many things like alchemy and kings and queens. Also, she meets her great uncle in a teenage form! It is a great book to read. It isn't too long or too short, either. The magic and the time travel are some of the main plots in the story. The best part is when the ship full of orphans come. Even if you are not a fan of fantasy, this book sure will make you one! Read it today or very soon!--FeatherBall"
2,Yongary = DontBuyME,This Kajiu flick is not good at not one point I actually enjoy this.I rather watch Godzilla bs Megalon then to watch this I mean it was a useless flick in my opinion.
3,From the pretty good to the indefensible,"Y'know, I wasn't really expecting to like either of these...So why buy the thing? Hey, it was cheap and I love the genre.But Konga was great! Misanthropic to be sure, some clunky effects without doubt but the former just added to its bent charms and the latter were not as numerous as I expected. Way more enjoyable than I was led to believe and everybody in the thing (except, weirdly, them playing cops) is a glorious, fat ham!Yongary, on the other hand, is the worst man-in-suit- monster movie I have had the rabid displeasure to see. I have a high tolerance for crappy movies but this is just unwatchable.So all three stars are for Konga, a deliciously guilty pleasure.And both flicks look great!"
3,Yongary/Konga,"I love watching old monster movies, but Yongary made me want to pluck my eyes out. I have a high tolerence for bad movies and this one rank #1, I hope to never watch again. Konga was on the flip side, it was ok, for a man in a ape suit, so I gave Konga 3 stars."
3,"poor packaging, but decent product","The book arrived a day earlier than predicted. However, some bindings were loose, the book was bent, and the box was partially opened."
1,Hmmmm,"The book had a lot of writing in it and it was said be ""be like new."" It was nothing like new, the pages were very beat up and much of the comb bounding was broken or broke soon after getting it. The book was in horrible condition to be like new."
3,Inconsistent,"Although the discussions of the topics are usually clear and concise, this book is not well organized. Obvious lack of adequate editing aside (numerous typos, grammatical errors, mislabeled figures, etc.), many of the end-of-chapter problems are not really coherent with the way things are introduced in the particular chapter. A few problems require knowing stuff that is explained later in the book. The book alone, therefore, is not suitable for self-study.It might make a good supplemental reading since the discussions themselves are pretty good. However, for an academic book like this one, it is also important to have a good index, and unfortunately it is not particularly useful either.Overall, I think the problem about this book is editing, or lack thereof. Time will tell if the book stands as a course textbook, but unless a new edition comes out with some improvements, I do not see why we should choose this book over some other alternatives, such as Chandler."
3,For completists only,"These sessions are presented as being ""remastered from original master tapes"", but it simply isn't true. Disk one, ""Django"", is 1937 Hot Club sessions--which were not recorded to tape, but direct to 78 rpm masters. The material is all available in the JSP box set ""Classic Early Recordings"" at much higher sound quality.The second disk is material from the time as RCA ""Djangology"" sessions. Some of this material can be found on ""The Indispensible Django Reinhardt 1949-1950"" The playing is excellent, especially the six tracks with Grappelli. The remaining seven tracks feature an adequate Italian rhythm sectionand Andre Ekyan on clarinet. Again, the material is plagued by surface noise not found on magnetic tape. There are some good things here, but the listener seeking good late performances by Django would be better served in every way by the RCA ""Djangology"" release and ""Peche ala Mouche""."
5,Shimano is all I use,Works great using a 48-tooth chainring and works with a 50-tooth. Used on my recumbent trike but switched to a Sturmey-Archer 3/9 hub and a Speed drive.
1,Wont work with Sony Reader Touch,"I had this memory stick for few years now. I have been using it in my PSP and few other devices without any problems, until now.I just bought Sony Reader Touch. This stick simply will not work with this reader. I have five other memory sticks in varying sizes, between 32k and 8Gig and they all work without any problems. This one does not.Apparantly some compatibility problem."
1,Unreliable...,"I used this in a PSP for a few months. Suddenly it stopped working. PSP is just saying that there is no memory stick inserted. Tried several times, removing battery etc, but it does not work...I'm disappointed, I thought Lexar was a good brand..."
1,Did Not Work in Sony PSP,This product did not reliabley work in a new Sony PSP running the current Sony software. Don't know if the design is flawed or the unit I received was defective.
1,Lexar Product,The Lexar 1GB MS Duo Pro is awesome. The price was good and the order and shipment from Amazon was 5 star.
5,Great inexpensive seat,"It does the job! We purchased this for my small 7 yr old with spastic quadriplegic cp to use in the kiddie pool with his brothers and sisters. This site has the best price and quick shipping! The seat is hollow plastic and very lightweight. Likely not the most comfortable thing, but my son didn't mind because he was very excited to be in the pool with his siblings!"
2,Hamilton Cat Collar,"I thought the construction was just okay, didn't expect it to be as light weight as it is. Also, I was totally expecting to receive the pink bell as seen in the picture and it arrived in black. At the final moment of purchase I missed that discrepancy. I was very disappointed I didn't receive exactly what I picked out. For what I received, I could have purchased it for less elsewhere which would have been about half the price I paid."
3,Product does work,I had all kinds of problems trying to back up my DVD collection. Bought this in hopes that it would be better. It more or less sucked on my old DVD burner/computer. I've just upgraded to a dual layer burner/Athlon X2 computer.. so this program does work. So far so good.
4,"Honestly , one of the scariest films i've seen ALL year","This coming from a true fan of the ""horror"" genre . It's breathtaking and horrifying to watch what happens to this ordinary American family . Very involving too . I do not have children of my own (it wasn't in the cards) . To know that this sort of thing was fairy common during the early 80's is VERY disturbing . This is an excellent value on vhs . $2.99 new as of this writing . It's a heartbreaking , above average telefilm that can elicit tears from even it's male viewers . See for yourself . Life can be stranger than fiction ."
4,Just ask my childrem,Pretty interesting. Makes you think what anyone can and will say about you? It kept s glued to the tv to figure out if he children will finally tell the truth after 14 years
4,Good Things Come in Small Packages,"Fr. Charles Miller's wonderful little book, ""Together in Prayer: etc"" was my textbook for a class entitled: The Psalms: the Prayer of the Church at St. Charles Seminary, outside Philadelphia, PA. I highly recommend this for the layman who would like to appreciate the psalms better, but have had trouble connecting to them in a meaningful way. Fr. Miller speaks, with great love, about the beauty and timelessness of the psalms by relating them to everyday situations. Fr. Miller shows how our everyday situations have a voice in these ancient poetic expressions. Although there are many Psalm scholars who will appeal to individuals involved in more serious study (such as Walter Bruggermann), Fr. Miller's ""Together in Prayer"" offers an accessable entrance point for the neophite. Anyone who reads this book will come away with a new appreciation for the Psalms."
1,Burner nughtmare,"This thing is a hunk of...! The support was good, but its a hunk of junk. it sounds like it wants to die when it opens and closes. It refused to burn disc to disc with my dell machine because it said my existind drive was not capable of digital audio extraction. Dell said this was BS. Iomega said it was a software issue. Eventually the thing wouldn't even write from the hard drive.P.S. it wasn't a plextor."
1,You can't rate a product unless you've been able to try it.,"I had heard alot of good things about Iomega. So I bought a very nice looking cd-rw rom/burner. The first blatent problem I had was the fact that their software to install the program to run the hardware was put on a cd. I only had one faulty cd-rom to begin with. So I tried a number of faulty options to try and get around this problem (i.e. not being able to network with another computer, not having large enough memory on my zip drive to hold the installation cd, faulty downloads on their internet site, no available floppy/zip disks to order the software for, and helpline employees with differant/opposing views/ideas). So what this all comes down to is if your able to own 2 cd-roms or 2 computers you MAY not have any problems. Otherwise, you'll end up sending this product back like I had to do."
1,The Hunger for Ecstasy,The book is written more for the very religious person. The book summary is mis-leading in a sense that it makes you believe it is more a self-help book. It is more a soul searching book.
1,Nick is stealing money from our children.,"I purchased Spongebob Squarepants Creature from the Krusty Krab for my boy, and behold it is exactly the same game as Nighty Nightmare. It even says Nighty Nightmare when you load up the game. Buyer beware the two game are the same (at least for the PC)."
2,Too hard for the age group it targets.,"My son gets very frustrated with this game (he's 4). He does not have the manual dexterity to get away from the various dangers in the game. The characters move very slowly, and that frustrates the b'jesus outa me, because I am always called to help. I think I got this game for $2, but I have paid for it dearly in sweat and tears. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this time sink. Get some Haba blocks instead. They are a sheer joy."
4,ONLY One,"I bought this product, shipment was incredible fast, but I Thought there were two trucks, if you buy the wheels you get four and I did, I bought the bearings an I got four, bought the hardware (screws and nuts) and I got eight, if you buy Trucks you are supossed to get TWO, Amazon should post that is only one truck per order, anyway I will have to buy another Truck and My kid wont get his full skateboard on time by christmas, because I had to travel overseas. Next time inform the numbers of parts on each sale."
3,Its coOl,i like the truck because my first one broke on the first day so i got this new one. ALERT ONLY ONE TRUCKafter i found out it was one truck i had to order another one thats red. the truck is not bad though
2,Mediocre,"Compared to MC Beaton's other works this is pitiful. I prefer her mysteries but other 'romance'books were better. With these books it has become a formula story: lovely young lady in some distress, meets handsome rich titled man, he solves her problems. Women don't have mind in these books...except the housekeeper who travels. I won't buy any more of her 'romances'."
3,What? No Fondants?,"I feel that this cookbook is missing a couple of important candy genres. Although it does include two recipes for marzipan, a rare phenomenon in the world of American candy books, there is no mention of hard candies other than nut brittles, and perhaps even more surprisingly, there are no fondant recipes. I consider fondant to be one of the cornerstones of candymaking, and lovely though this book may be, I can't help but feel cheated by its misleadingly wide-ranging title. It does, however, boast an extensive section on truffles, and the technique chapter at the beginning of the book sports an exceptionally thorough and unique explanation of chocolate tempering and how one holds a temper. If you already have a collection of candy books that covers all the bases, Truffles, Candies and Confections is a nice addition. But if you're looking for an introduction to candy making in general, this is not it."
5,Great Truffle Recipes,I think that this is a great book because it gives you so many flavors for chocolate truffles. If you are looking for new and exciting flavors for your truffles this is the book.
4,nice product,nice andefficient product ; it heats like a charm ! i is just the thermostat who should be more precise !and ...thanks to a very god prompt seller !
3,Broan fans are loud.,"If you are looking for a heater fan unit that replaces your old Broan heater, this is it.This heater fan is an exact match to its decades old product.It fit the existing opening within a sixteenth of an inch.However if you are looking for an improved product, this is not it.It has the same loud fan noise as the old one.It will require the same periodic cleaning to keep it running.It will need to be removed annually to be cleaned and oiled.For the price it is a good product and will last ten to fifteen years, but if want a quiet heater, pay moe and buy a unit with a better fan."
5,Warmth coming out of the shower!,"My husband installed this in a 8 by 5 ft room with toilet and shower. Now it's warm and toasty when I come out of the shower; heats up nicely from the regular room temp of about 68, so that shaving my legs is not a 'drafty project' in winter!"
4,Great heaters,"I have several houses (rentals) and I have this heater in several. They can be wired in 110v or 220v. I would give them 5 stars but they seem to die a bit more frequently than I would like. Of course if someone vacuumed them out to keep hair, dust etc from building up they would probably last longer. Tenants don't care so that does not happen."
2,"Compact, but doesn't give too much heat","Looks nice and compact, but it doesn't give as much heat as my other heaters. The blow is not very strong. It good for very small room only."
4,Great little heater,"Took about 2 hours to wire in and install with a digital timer switch... left the wiring in 120V 1500 watt, and it produces a great amount of heat for the bathroom. Just installed today so can't say how long it will last, but, at $70 or so, you can replace just the inards pretty easily, no need to replace the frame and electrical..."
4,broan 174,this bathroom heater was easy to install not to noisy and works well quickly heats up our bathroom.would recommend for a small to medium size bathroom
4,Good product!,"We installed 3 of these in our cottage along with baseboard heaters - the Broan heater is better by far! Granted the fan is a little loud (the reason I did not rate the product a 5), but the heaters are easy to use and quick to warm up. I would definitely buy them again."
5,Wonderful .... after your consult your installed manual,"After doing my homework and checking out numerous customer reviews, I purchased the Nomad II along with a 64MB Smart Card.This is my first MP3 player and I didn't want to spend more than I had to for a new toy. (I have a digital camera so I have the necessary hardware to transfer music files.) This is far less expensive than purchasing a player with more memory. Getting started was a bit difficult using the sheet of printed directions which came with the player. However, as soon as I consulted and printed out the manual--which is excellent---Go to PROGRAMS -- CREATIVE --NOMAD II and you will find the manual.(Before you activate the manual start the Adobe program or the manual won't automatically appear. I printed it out so I could comfortably follow the directions and learn to use all the features. The software is good and as long as you consult the help menu. It's very easy to install music and play it back. Enjoy!"
4,Mislead on Features...,"After reading ""All the great features of NOMAD II at a price you can't resist"" from Creative's site and looking at Amazon's nice large pictures I thought the ""C"" really did have all the features of the NOMAD II, blah, blah, plus it had the onboard 32 so it looked like a really good deal over the original II. But it DOES NOT have FM radio, which I found out today when it was delivered. Also the picture Amazon has of this product showing the FM tuner IS NOT an actual picture of this product. It works great for me with itunes and OS X but I wanted the FM tuner...."
5,Great mp3 player!!!,I think this mp3 player is one of the best that has 32mb and it really compact so you can fit it in your pocket. One con about this is that it only has 32mb but it doesn't matter because you can just buy more mb and put it in your player. But all and all it's great and I really love it.
1,Software doesn't work,"We did a lot of research before buying this and saw that a few people had trouble with the software, but didn't hear it from others. Well, we can't get it to work at all, and there's no custoemr support available from Creative since you can never get through on their 800 number - and it took 20 minutes to even find a phone number, it's extremely well hidden. Terrible disappointment!"
2,A Bang for Your Buck?,"Yeah - if you can get it to work, that is. Mine stopped working after 2 months. Controls and menus are a bit awkward - hard to navigate thru. Spend [more money] and get a decent player, if you can - you'll save yorself a headache and additional expenses."
5,Excellent product,"Only complaints are that the 2 memory cards are treated completely separate and USB transfer is very slow. Very small, very light weight, seems sturdy (although I have not dropped it yet). I never installed any of the software, since I use iTunes and it is just supported."
5,"Nomad II ""C"" Series","This is the BEST MP3 player out there. It is my 1st one and i am completely satisfied with it. I got it for my birthday about 5 months ago. It still works well without any problem.I use MusicMatch to put music onto my Nomad IIc. With MusicMatch i can compress the audio files so i can get 73 songs onto mine with a 128Mb memory card plus the built in 32 MB. If anyone doubts this player, DONT, buy it its the BEST player for the money...Much better than a MiniDisc Player. Don't buy one of those."
4,love it. hate the spyware,"the nomad 32 is a great little machine. we just got it, and then added a 64mb card and the total price was just 150$. pretty great deal.my only complaint is the creative labs software installs a weird little spyware program called NewsUPD.exe that by all reports is just straight-up spyware. type ""NewsUPD.exe"" into google and see for yourself.great product. lousy company."
5,CREATIVE fan,"I am very satisfied with the clarity of the output. Very light weight and slim enough to put into a pants pocket. Navigating needs getting used to; also, you should really invest in a rechargable battery for this MP3 player."
3,Disc set,"3 CD set - the first two being ""The Cream"" a live set of two discs, and the second being 'Blue on Blues"". This is a split disc with Lightnin' Hopkins. I am not a fan of live discs, but it was not bad. The split disc was interesting. Neither was blowout to force me to put it into the keeper pile."
4,nice colection,"If you like blues or John Lee Hooker, this is a nice collection of blues, i.e., some of his best songs."
5,An Extra Helpful Strategy Guide!,"This book was a great help to me when I was playing Duke. This guide shows and explains how to get out of each level and also shows secret areas! If you've ever been lost in the levels of Duke Nukem 3D before, this book is the answer!"
5,Get this book before it's not available anymore,"Unfortunately the seller from whom we bought this sent all 5 copies wrapped together in brown paper (a _single_ layer of brown paper) and didn't have replacements available when the books inevitably arrived damaged. Which is too bad, because this book makes a great gift (we already have a copy - we were buying all of these to be given as gifts).Every recipe in this book is delicious and relatively easy to make. For example, the Spanish tortilla (egg and potato omelet) is phenomenal and very simple to make (except for the flipping). However, nothing in this book is low fat, low calorie, low carb, or low anything else. Not to say it's not healthy (as in balanced), but very few of these recipes would be allowed on just about any diet program.If you like to cook Italian / Spanish / Greek food or know someone who does, then get this book."
3,"It is not so easy, chaps.","Mixing the unauthorized arriving with accepted newcomers, doco provides facilely a multi-case picture of populating the USA that could, according to a moviemaker, easily be reached even by a chair-bound English-short Ecuadorian from a distant Latin American rainforest.What is really nice is realism of an unstoppable quest for the Land of the Free, and humour of those happy for having the past just simply survived."
2,"An unfunny and grotesque, sexist relic","Continuing along the path of weird early '60s films that skirt the collision between the pre- and post-sexual revolution cultures, comes this truly nauseating sex comedy. Jack Lemmon plays Hogan, a nightmarish, leering peeping tom of a landlord who stalks and sexually harasses a young couple that have moved into his apartment complex. His ""comedic"" personification of Hefneresque wolf-whistle culture is grotesque in the extreme. It's hard to imagine that people really found this funny as opposed to offensive. Leonard Maltin describes Lemmon's character as ""love-hungry,"" I'd call him in need of a permanent restraining order. A weird social time capsule, yes, but also a deeply disturbing, yucky film."
1,Yawn!,"I hate to be so negative about a book on spirituality, but Taylor's book is a boring read. There is no new information or any creative insights in this book. It is a regurgitation of stuff that everyone already knows, and it is a superficial survey of New Age culture. Is Taylor trying to position himself as the Workshop Guru of the Week with this new and unnecessary book? I wonder. HAven't we had enough of those guys? Gee, when is someone going to finally write something new and interesting for a change. This book will put you to sleep."
3,The delivery was good but the movie was a bit disappointing,You see the movie was a bit disappointing. The omitted my favorite character scenes from the real show. For example Mello is barely in it at all... although L is in the beginning..that was funny.Unfortunately like with the first movie if you didn't watch the show it doesn't make sense even though it was made for people that haven't seen the show. Seeing as how I dislike Near's character I wasn't fond of this movie but what can you do...oh yeah watch the show! the movie delivery however was the antithesis of disappointing! I got the two DVDs I ordered 2 days earlier than I expected!
1,Broke right away,This broke right away. It also only come with one man and there is two spots for people. Not a fun toy.
4,"Rear adaptor funky, but it works","I got the FireWire version of the Zip drive.My previous purchase of the USB version has been flawless.The FireWire version is a little funky because the firewire interface doesn't look ""normal/integrated"", there is this funky adaptor that attaches to the rear and appears to convert the firewire to something else (looks like SCSI).The manner in which this adaptor attaches to the rear is a little precarious (looks like it won't stay hooked reliably).But I in fact had no problem getting the software to work, and the drive has not given me any problems at all."
4,Great Stuff,"Overall a great book, some areas are alittle wordy or need clarification. It's written by a covener...so if you're a solitare like me you have to modify, which is somewhat frustrating. Otherwise it is recommended"
5,EXCELLENT,"I much prefer matte photos, and was thrilled to find this pack available. I can only get the glossy pack locally for my PictureMate. The quality of the photos printed on this paper is phenomenal! I work in the scrapbook industry, so photo quality and longevity is important to me. The photos from this paper/ink combo have been tested and found to last longer than photos processed by the labs at the average retail store. (Do a web search for photo life to find the test results)Two thumbs up to Epson for this combo!"
3,Epson T5570 Too Expensive,"Prints come out beautiful, but there is no way to get 50 photos with these PictureMate ink packs (50 sheets with each ink pack). I get maybe 30 at most. Plus these are very expensive. And typical with all these Epson printers is you always have to do endless Head Cleaning which uses ink."
1,No power adapter,"This is called a car kit, yet it arrived with no adapter for power in the car??? If you have bought the Nomad with earphones and carrying case, the only thing you get in this kit that you need is the adapter to play the Nomad through your car speakers. The price seems a little high for that. I am returning the accessory kit and looking elsewhere to get what I really need."
4,Wacky Insight Into Turn of the Century (ixx to xx) medicine,"This book, nowadays, might be very funny to doctors, in the same way an Archie comic book would be funny to a great writer, but its a written record that gives us a clear insight into the customs and minds of modern ixx century medicine.Apart from that this book can also be alittle frightening, for its impressive to see what the great minds of the age considered diseases or remedies.This edition is a very concise version of the original and deals only with a couple of chapters.Even if you dont care about medicine, its a very fun book to read. You will be surprised to what was considered the source of vitalogy and long life in 1899."
3,A couragous author!,"I admire Shere Hite's courage to cover such a controversial topic, but that doesn't make it a good book. The focus was more on making people shocked at such a controversial topic than on covering such a controversial topic. Even so, it brought up many taboo topics that should've been out in the open years ago. Good book, not well balanced. Shere Hite is a good writer. Someone who can rackle this sort of sexual topic has to be!"
3,Serves well for one purpose,The book serves well as for the testimonies it has. It keeps a neutral line as for instructing the best sexual approach following the duality presented in the testimonies in the subject of orgasm and sexual joy by vaginal sex vs. non-vaginal sex.
4,"Not only mandatory for Females, but also for MALES","The Hite Report: A National Study of Female SexualityI first purchased ""The Hite Report"" in the early 80's.I am a straight male and a product of the 60'sThis is a Sexuality survey of FEMALES,for FEMALES, done BY A FEMALE.I learned a lot about the opposite sex, and acquired a better understand of a Female's private sexuality.-YES YES -I told my lady friends ""The Hite Report"" is Mandatory reading.Regarding there own personal pleasures, desires, fantasies, wants, and feelings they have had to deal with, they will say ""I'm OK"" ""I'm NOT ALONE""Now 20+ years later it is still very informative. I purchased 2 additional copies for the Young-ins who tell me it's the ""Bomb"". Now they think this old geezer is alright.It is life changing for the Females.Males will have a better understanding of female's and relationships.Looks like more copies for the young-ins this Xmas"
3,Came with a scratch and is longer than it looks,"Only wore this pair once. Not happy at all with them.On the pictures it doesn't look too long, but when you wear it, you feel like you are wearing elf shoes with pointy ends.Build is OK, mine came with a scratch on it."
3,Good shoe.,The shoes are very comfy and true to size; however the finish of the color made them appear aged.
5,Distressed a bit...,This shoe is cut true to size. My husband loves them and he was able to wear them during his business meetings and keep them on for hours. He walks up and down the city in them as well. I noticed that he loved them so much that I bought a pair for my brother too.
5,this band treads where others fear to tread,"very few black metal and/or dark metal bands go down the road that Aeterus has paved. there is a beautiful piano introduction (track one)that begins this album. track two starts off with a bludgeoning riff and then slows the pace a little and has some instrumental bits to it for a few seconds. this is a beautiful sounding masterpiece that begs your attention. Amazon lists 10 tracks, but there are two bonus tracks on this disc. I wish there was a lyric sheet with this release. otherwise, I have no other minor complaints."
5,"Powerful, dark metal","A very solid, individual album. While I certainly wouldn't call it ""black metal"" (the band calls themselves ""dark metal""), it is certainly along the same lines, with the average lyric being a rather deep deathy growl, on occasions rising to shrieks. The atmosphere changes from song to song, and they actually play some songs in a major key, which I must say is a novelty with most of the ""darker"" metal. Definitely a solid buy for those looking for something different than your average black metal album, but still retaining the same rough feel. The celtic harp solo at the end is great touch too, I might add."
2,Cute but not helpful for my toddler,"A cute story, but it didn't help my toddler one bit, actually may have backfired. In the story, Billy is afraid of his new bed which looks scary in the dark. He has a bad dream that he is getting too big for his crib so the next morning his parents find him in his big boy bed and are very happy. So my toddler says ""I want to sleep in my crib like Billy"" and ""I jump out of my crib like Billy"" which is not what we wanted. Although he loves reading the book over and over so maybe it's just taking a long time to sink in... like 6 months..."
5,Sho 'Nuf,"Having very little listening experience with the sho, but being very familiar with the playing of Christina Fong, I wasn't sure exactly what to expect from this (which is a good thing, expectations can be a prison). What I found was that Ms. Fong's playing of John Cage is as exquisite as ever (I have been fortunate enough to see her play the solo violin music of John Cage live) and the sho is an exceptional instrument for interpreting this music also. A must-have for all fans of John Cage."
5,Two3 et al from OgreOgress Productions,"For anyone that's into the music of John Cage, this is an incredible new addition to the sparse collection of his recordings that are available. I believe it's the first time Two3 has ever been recorded as composed, it's certainly the first time anyone released a recording of it anyway. And that makes it a ""must have"" for serious Cage collectors. The recording quality from OgreOgress is, as always, superb."
2,Not the quality expected,I expected a better quality for a product of this price. The canvas is thin and since it is stretched tightly I do not think it would hold up for long. The inside is roomy and filled with nice service items. I'm returning mine and hoping to find something more worth the money.
5,A welcome change of pace!,"I got this book as a gift for a pregnant friend, and really wish it had been around when I was pregnant with my son! Fearless Pregnancy provides great balance to all the other fear-based books on the market, which kept me anxious and worried for nine months about very unlikely risks. The authors offer a more positive and reassuring approach to discussing pregnancy issues, and the tone of the book is approachable, warm, and friendly (without being shallow and weight-obsessed, like the Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy). This is a practical and encouraging read for any mom-to-be."
5,very informative and a quick read,Great book! Very education but not boring. I find the tips very practical and easy to follow.
1,"A book of personal opinions, not facts","I bought this book because I am prone to anxiety and thought it might help alleviate some of my pregnancy fears. This book basically gives instructions for how to be one of those parents who puts themselves first. Some of the advice given by this book: eat all the sushi you want, feel free to drink wine, make sure you keep getting your fake nails done (no harm in breathing THOSE chemicals), but when asked whether a pregnant woman should go camping? Well, this book basically says, ""Why would you want to?!"" I'm not interested in this recipe for a marginal child."
1,Unfortunate,"I recently read an article from Victoria Clayton, and she is so misinformed. I like another mom who posted a review of this book think this is a HUGE disservice to many mom's to be out there who just want to bring home a baby PERIOD. Which many women don't. I know that I myself, can't afford to worry about small pregnancy complaints such as morning sickness. I just need to worry that my baby is going to be alive in 9 months."
4,Most surprising film of the year.,"Being a big fan of Daniel Clowe's book ""Ghostworld"", the last thing that I would want would be a sub-par book to movie adaption such as ""Forrest Gump"" or another ""Bonfire of the Vanities"", but with Ghostworld,I was pleasantly surprised.Directed intelligently by Terry Zwigoff,and starring Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi,you can see that thought was put into this film, and they didn't pay millions for overpaid Hollywood actors and actresses. I was happy with basically every thing in the movie despite minor holes in the plot at the end."
1,Partisan Politics Provide Poor Analysis,"Unfortunately, instead of an thorough analysis of the genesis, justifications, and problems with overarching property rights, DeLong acts as a mouthpiece for other property rights activists. DeLong covers some of the same ground as Congressman Richard Pombo in his 1996 This Land Is Our Land, simply emphasizing anomalous examples instead of practicable solutions. DeLong's denial of the externalities resulting from uninhibited development leave his analysis unbalanced and ill-founded. DeLong's politics overcome his analysis. This book is similar to his condemnation of industry for their recognition to the denial of carbon dioxide emissions. (...) His political agenda overwhelm his rationale"
1,"A horrible edition, badly printed","I was very disappointed in the quality of this reprint. It looks like a very poor scan of the original, with blotchy, hard-to-read type (poor resolution, perhaps, or somebody turned up the contrast on the scan too high in an effort to get rid of stains or some such thing), and it's been over-enlarged to make the page margins too small. It is painful to read, which would not be so awful if it were a short work but is downright prohibitive in a book of this length. I will go and seek out a better printing; this was a waste of money."
1,AMAZING BOOK - Horrible scan of original version,"Excellent book, horrible scan. So horrible I had to return it. And it pained me to do so because it rules so much."
1,Maximum Support is an UNDERSTATEMENT,"If you're looking for a pillow for support while sitting up in bed this is the pillow for you! However, if you're looking for a pillow for a good night's sleep while sleeping on your side keep looking. This pillow is so firm my shoulder didn't reach the mattress while laying on my side! It was like laying on a brick! Also the fabric is so stiff I heard it crinkle every time I moved! I woke up with a stiff neck this morning although I ended up getting up in the middle of the night to retrieve my old pillows!"
2,"Good intentions, poorly argued.","I was initially impressed by the topics to be covered in this book however found that few areas were well discussed. Whilst myself exploring the differences between modern psychology and Nouthetic counseling, this book failed to completely discuss the areas detailed in its contents. I was particularly disappopinted with the chapter ""The myth of intergration"" which had very little to do with intergrating modern psychology with Biblical concepts. Examples were biased and information appeared to be delievered without the thoroughness that such texts require for today's critical minds. As this review is titled, I believe the author had good intentions, however with exposure to Jay Adams and the like for his work, this book offers very little useful information."
3,Good points/Bad points,"Typical work from those who view psychology as the tool of Satan. It has its valid points (there is no denying that), and it manifests some serious errors in knowledge of psychological thought, especially of Christian psychology. Read it critically, challenging the assumptions it makes"
1,Anarchic approach to christian counselling,This book is so typical of it's day and when it was written. I hate to think that people might still have this viewpoint & that it's all about drumming in the christianity component of healing in total ignorance of the benefits of psychology and what it can truthfully offer.
5,Christian soldier in Soviet Army,"Around the 1970s a Russian named Vanya served in the USSR's Red Army. He was a Christian, and God through powerful and mighty supernatural visitations and miracles confirmed his love to Vanya, and the people around him, as he served in the Communist Russian forces. This book was touching and forceful, well-written, and magnetic, as the true story was related by the author."
1,A Disappointment,"This pillow didn't live up to my expectations. Don't buy the hype in the product description. To me, it's all bogus. For one, it's too thin to ease neck pain. Secondly, to call this pillow even remotely firm would be a joke."
3,Waiting for them to be a little flatter...,"Definitely for a back sleeper! This pillow is just so thick, you kind of feel you head is at a high angle if you sleep on your side or stomach. I think once they flatten a little, they will be good. They are super soft, though."
3,Doesn't last.,"After a month of wearing the watch daily, the band turned grey. After wearing the watch for a year, the buckle broke."
4,Prestige White Scrub Watch,"I like how large the numbers are and its simple looking. Looks great with jeans or shorts...Great nurse's watch, easy to see."
4,Pretty Good,"I bought this watch for my nursing clinicals this fall. Although I have not worn this yet, I have set the clock and turned it on. The band seems pretty good-it is pretty thin, but I don't mind it because I don't want to wear something really bulky. The only thing that will bug me about this watch is the TICKING. It's so loud for a wristwatch. I'm sure it won't bother me as much when I actually start using it and I get used to it. But other than that, it seems like a pretty good basic nursing watch."
4,Good Watch,I love the watch though it looked different from what is shown in the photo.. Its way more bigger and the logo was different.. give this watch a shot its a good buy.. BTW I bought this watch because I'm currently on CNA class and this would be really helpful in taking pulse and respirations.
2,Not worth $30,"I origionally bought this watch because I am starting my Nursing program here in the next few months, but this watch was not going to cut it. It felt very cheap, and looked it too. I feel as though I could have gotten the same quality at Walmart or Kmart for half the price at least."
2,Band won't stay together.,"Watch looks fine, but the band keeps coming apart. I have reattached it twice in 3 days. It doesn't seem worth the effort."
2,Watch randomly stops working,I have had this watch for less than a month and it keeps on stopping. Not good for trying to keep myself on task at work. Looking for another easy to keep clean watch with military time.
4,Good for the price,"Havent used it in practice yet, but it is such a classic watch, I thought it would be big on me as I have small wrists, but it looks great! The strap is quite stiff, but its comfortable on."
2,"Good book, terrible kindle book - no navigation","While the reviews themselves are entertaining, the Kindle book provides absolutely no navigation tools and there is no listing of the films that are reviewed. To find out what is reviewed and where the review appears you must go through the book page by page. Absolutely useless as a reference companion for rmovie watching."
4,Interesting and Informative Look Back,A very interesting look back at the state of affairs during the period leading upto and after the American Revolution. Worth the purchase.
5,Works like it's supposed to,"I bought this little item to protect the back lens element for when I want to take reverse-lens macro photos and it works just as it's supposed to. Having this is definitely worth it's price considering it protects your lens from nature's elements when going outdoors, not to mention water droplets being a major subject of macro photography. Note, however, not all 52mm threads are made equal; my B+W UV filter won't fit, but my Nikon polarizer does. Maybe it only accepts Nikon filters? I doubt it, but I don't have any other brands to try it with."
1,Prime Suspect #4,"As for the DVD: Helen Mirren is just tops as an actress. Beyond her acting, the entire cast does a fantastic job,with a great story line.However, the container, carrying the two disc set was damaged beyon repair. The two disc were not, however, damaged. I reported the damage to Amazon and they forwarded a case with a one disc. compartment----not a biggee. P.S.---We are now located in Fernley, NV, not Merced, CA. Don"
4,"superb work by Mirren, et al.","The three stories in this installment of the Prime Suspect series are intense, absorbing, beautifully done. As mentioned in other reviews, the re-casting of the George Marlowe character in 'The Scent of Darkness' is strange, but not fatal to the telling of the tale.Warning: there are no extras whatsoever in this DVD set (which is why I give it four instead of five stars) -- no commentary, no language/subtitles options, no additional features re: the making or the people involved in the making of, nothing. Just three excellent Jane Tennyson stories."
5,"Most current definitive reference, Alaskan fishing","Well written, entertaining and easy reading! This sturdy paperback reference is encyclopedic in the thoroughness with which it covers Alaskan fishing. The authors have broken Alaska down into logical regions and present the fishing opportunities for each. This ""bush"" manual conveys both a sense of sportsmanship and conservation."
3,Best of the Lone Ranger,Muy buenos capitulos y a Color. Los recomiendo. Aunque creo que hay mas a colores . Deben parar a dvd los otros de esta gran coleccion.
3,Ok for more batteries,"I bought this item because i needed two more 18v batteries and it is a better deal to get two tools with the batteries instead of buying the batteries separately, it works out to spending $50 and getting a second hammer drill and cut out tool. The hammer drill is great I now have two. it is a bit heavy so expect your wrist to give out after a long day. Also the drill has more kickback and recoil then it should. I'm a bit dissatisfied with the cut out tool, there is no variable speed control, and the tool is physically large so it not good for detailed work."
2,The Maltese Cross,"This book was not as well organized as many past and current books on the subject of firefighting have been. You must almost read ahead to follow the story line to determine what took place before certain tragic events. Tragedy after tragedy seemed to follow Lt.Jeff Ramsey, the main character of story,no matter where he went during his firefighting career. There was almost a lack of proofreading at the printers and there was some missing or incorrect punctuation in several places throught the book. The story surrounding the attempted terrorist attack did add an intersting element of suspense."
4,good product now available with organic certification,"Great substitute for sugar and all artificial sweetners .. You can grow the stevia plant in your backyard garden, use its leaves as a natural sweetener ..which is what I do.. but when the cold season hits and I am out of my own stevia, I purchase the granulated stevia.. This product has no aftertaste, mixes well with hot teas.. and is now available with an organic certification .. if you prefer the safety of organic products .. which I do .. Its competitor, Sweet Leaf, also recently reformulated its product .. Will need to do a comparison .. To save more $$$ some of these granulated stevia products also come in bulk, without the individual packaging and cost .. so you can ""spoon"" out what you need .. a more green lifestyle option than the individual packets here .."
3,"A good sale, but some problems.","I believe this product is a good value for the purdchase price. However, I did encounter problems with the transaction.(1)It took several weeks past the promised delivery date to receive it,(Although,admittedtly, it was over the Christmas mailing season). And,(2) when I finally did receive it, the product was not packaged as pictured; For the individual Stevia packets were deliverd loosely bundled in one clear plastic bag inside of the mailing box.It would have been preferrable to recieve them in the appropriate labeled, package as advertised/shown.I would then have felt more immediate confident that I received the proper number of product packets, and less wanting of the task to actually count them!"
3,NOW Stevia packets,This product arrived packaged nicely and on time however I now own 400 packets of a product I don't care for. I owned another brand of Stevia which I really liked and it tasted very much like a very sweet sugar. This has a strange taste to me and a very strong aftertaste. I had stevia at my in-laws and it also did not have the taste of this stevia. I can't really recommend this-- sorry - maybe it's just my personal preference. I'm going to try another brand.
3,Not for me...,"This stuff seems very silky, it smells great, and it's as easy to use as shave gel. Unfortunately, my skin just cant handle a razor. I'm far too sensitive. I'm sure for people with regular skin, this product is great but if you have terribly sensitive skin, this may not work. Guess I'll have to go back to waxing."
2,Not what I ordered...,"I ordered this last month. And while I know it was meant to be a good gesture, they sent me the ""extra % for free!"" Bottles. The beads inside were white, not blue like it shows. I've bought this in stores and the beads were also blue. Also the designs on the outside chipped off like crazy and covered my entire shower within minutes in colored paint chips. Which I had to then spend 20 minutes picking up after I got out. And on top of that, the gel smelled off, like it was old. When I order something, I expect to get what I ordered, not some back of the shelf crap that they forgot was there and need to get rid of."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book a relatively little use in a recent trip to the Altamaha basin. During my limited scouting, I found at least five errors on the maps which resulted in extra miles driven. Moreover, the narrative fails to mention the pervasive impact of the pulp plant stench on enjoyment of the lower river. I wonder if the information available has really been updated from the earlier guidebooks. While there is some useful information in this book, I strongly recommend using online sources and local maps to augment trip planning."
3,cute but no support,"Cute shoe but absolutely no support. I can only wear them for short periods, and NO WALKING distances."
1,Sound quality so poor I returned the product,"A previous reviewer stated that in an area with a high degree of RF interference performance was poor. I have to agree, I tried various settings, disconnected all wireless devices in my house and still had an audible hiss on all channels. My unit was installed at a distance of only 50ft between sending and receiving units. If they ever come out with a 2.4ghz version, performance might be better but I can't recommend this one."
1,You pay for what you get...,"This product did what it says it will do, but don't expect it to sound like you're listening to a CD. Because it's only 900MHz, it sounds like you're listening to your music on a weak FM station. There is a high-pitched hiss that doesn't seem to go away regardless of the signal strength. I was transmitting line-of-site 10 feet across the room and the hiss persisted."
5,Easy way to link your computer and stereo,"The product performs as promised. It installed easily. The Soundlink broadcasts to 88.3 FM on the stereo tuner and I have also plugged it into my multiroom amplifier so I can listen to internet radio around the house. After installation, use the scan button on the receiver to get the strongest signal, and adjust the volume contols on the computer to limit static. The only downside I see is the lack of a remote control, but I haven't found that to be a big problem."
5,Convenient and easy,"Just bought the SoundLink system to pipe streaming I-net radio into my living room. Setup is hassle free: plug the transformers for the two units into a power outlet (they also run on 4 AA cells, if you want to be mobile on either end), run the cinch cables into your stereo, the sound plug into your computer (and the transmitter also has a sound out to plug your computer sound into). Sound quality is great, like FM radio or audiotape, good enough for me since I'm not an audiophile. A neat unit."
3,A Simple Solution With Several Caveats,"This device was very easy to set up and use, but beware of a few caveats: first, I found the 88.1 and 88.3FM options a total bust - the reception was very poor. However, the 900MHz link works fine, but it means that you have to use the receiving unit as well as the base unit. Second, the sound quality is satisfactory for voice-grade audio, which is what I was looking for, but it is only so-so for music. Finally, the manufacturer has inexplicably not included a volume control or headphone jack on the receiving unit. A trip to Radio Shack took care of the headphone connection, but I have to go back to the source (in my case a computer streaming BBC Radio 4) to adjust the volume."
1,Professional Engineer,"I have not been able to get a consistent lock between receiver and transmitter no matter what I tried. Perhaps it's localinterference, but the system is useless to me and is being shipped back. Based on what I've read and my experience, whether or not this system will work for you is a crap shoot. Even when it works, the sound quality is poor.I'm going for a cable connection between my PC and stereo. I know that will work and it will cost less."
2,Poor quality product,"If you want to still have audible sound from your PC speakers,do not buy this product. Although it works as advertised,transmitting a (very weak) signal, it totally distorts thesound that is transmitted from the output jack of the deviceto the PC speakers. I'm returning mine, and buying some longspeaker cables instead, since distances involved are notextensive."
2,poor workmanship and/or quality control,"purchased a few days ago. spectacular when working. have had an intermittent problem from day 1. originally thought it might be somehow power limiting for protection. unfortunately its an intermittency in the radio-link output circuitry..... great idea just needs to be more robust. do i send it back or junk it, after postage and hassle probably junk it :-/"
5,Great soloution,"In a word...PERFECT. Not for the picky audiofile (I occasionally get a little hum, not noticeable at normal volumes)but for those of us who just want to play our extensive MP3 collection and internet radio in other rooms in your house this is the answer. I've got mine fairly close, but the FM tuning is superb and I can finally entertain in my family room without having to load down the CD changer. Works flawlessly with my iMac and my Toshiba laptop. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to get more from their MP3 collection."
4,"It works, but...","This appears identical to the Kima I bought several years ago (USR is black, Kima is silver). I used it to transmit music to FM radios around the house. It worked well at first, with a range of 10 ft. or more; but over the years, the FM transmission seems to have weakened. Now, even sitting next to an FM radio, the reception is unusable. I see the USR is no longer available from Amazon but the Kima is still available elsewhere."
5,Works Like a Charm,"I've just installed mine and am completely satisfied with the results. It works perfectly throughout a two-story house that's loaded with computer network, sound system, and ham radio wiring. Couldn't ask for more."
1,Not a good product,"as somewhat of an early adopter, I took a flyer on the Soundlink 6003. Even with this product directly wired on both the transmitter & reciever ends. It produces at best POOR SOUND reproduction. I suspect that other (more positive) reviews written here may be living in more rural settings with less RF interference. at [the price] it's a low cost solution, frankly, I'm suprised U.S. Robotics would put there brand on this Klima design. for those willing to part with [more money] and a LAN pulled in the house the RIO Digital Audio Reciever may provide a better solution. as always let the buyer beware.."
1,Electronic Fan,"Product does not work as advertised. Don't waste yourmoney. Poor sound quality, interference prone, sometimesjust doesn't work."
1,Not worth your money,"I'm rather perplexed at all the positive reviews on this product. I hooked this up and tried all the settings to get it to sound good and it just doesn't work. You'll get better reception from an AM radio station than you do from one of these things. If your looking for something to connect your computer and all your .mp3 files to your stereo system, this isn't the device to do it with."
1,The Adventures of Mark twain,"I couldn't play the DVD on my DVD player/recorder and couldn't figure out why. I finally read the jacket and it said that it would play only on a DVD player, and would not work on a DVD player /recorder. Who ever heard of such of crazy thing. Needless to say, its useless and will have to go back...."
1,Put your time to a better use!,The reviews looked funny so I broke with tradition (of NEVER renting Will Farrell movies) for this film. Next time I have an urge to watch a Will Farrell movie I think I will lay down in a dark room until the feeling goes away.(much like what you would do for a migraine)There are definitely better uses for your time. I would even consider scrubbing the bathroom to watching another movie by this actor.The father's maid was the best part of the movie. She was funny!
3,Not Will's best,Funny but won't watch it again. I usually watch Will's movies over and over but probably not this one i
3,The Campaign,It was short on comedy and plot. The characters were not that believable. It is not something I would view again.
2,Underwhelmed,"Love Will Ferrell and Zach G, but I expected more from this. The satire itself was pretty great, but I barely had a laugh out loud moment. I couldn't get into Zach's character at all. Kinda of an ""eh"" movie for me."
2,Slow!,"Sorry, not my favorite movie. Very slow and not very funny. i slept through most of it or I'd have more to say!"
2,Not very funny,Waste of time and money. All the funny parts are in the preview. Tries way too hard to be dirty and funny. It's neither.
4,Better Than We Expected,"After Ferrell's latest series of bombs, my wife and I expected another D.O.A. comedy, especially with Hit-N-Miss Galifianakis. With expectations low, we were pleasantly surprised to see that this comedy was mostly watchable!"
3,Meh-,"Being fans of the main actors, we had some high hopes but after a few funnylines, the movie did nothing for us."
2,Sometimes funny but...,This movie was funny sometimes but there were inappropriate and unnecessary language and scenes. The latter took away from the humor.
2,ok,could have been 35 to 45 minutes long and been just as ok if your bored and dont have anything else to watch its ok
2,Not very amusing,"My family and I found this movie dry and boring. I would say it was a total waste of time and money. In my opinion it is not worth renting, certainly not one to add to your comedy library."
2,Disappointed!,Really like both the main actors in this movie. Expected it to be hilarious with Will Ferrell andZach Galifianakis in it. Most the jokes were old and not funny anymore.
3,Some spots slow and boring,"like a number of movies it has moments of real belly busting laughs. There are however long periods in the movie that are just filler, little or no humor and the dialog seems to be an after thought of the writers."
3,Some occasional laughs,"On paper, this should be a hilarious movie. These are the two funniest men alive right now, however, the wittiness that both are capable of is stifled by recycled jokes and weak stabs at laughs. Is it worth renting? Yes- it is a fun, but forgettable hour and a half. You'll laugh- but a week from now you won't remember any of it."
2,Some funny one liners,"Some classic funny liners, like any Will Farrel movie, but even with its short running time the movie seemed to move a bit slow in parts."
3,Averagely funny,It was pretty funny but far from Will Ferrell's best. It might be one of those movies that you have to watch more than once...
4,Spoof,This is a funny way to help show kids how politics work. It could be used as a funny learning resource.
1,Spitefully anti-Christian,"Just when I think that Hollywood reached bottom with its standard anti-Christian profanity, it manages to break through to yet another basement. This is not a Monty Python anymore; this is the lowest level of sewage that would make Stalinist propaganda of 1950's blush.And so, a few more actors joined my NO-WATCH list. Bye-bye Will Farrell, buddy."
1,"Not funny, just vulgar","A few funny parts sprinkled here and there, but most of the movie is just vulgar. I stopped watching half way through because I was bored."
3,Does its job.,"I pretty much like Will Ferrell and Galifianakis even in the bad movies in which they have appeared. So I didn't think my money would be that poorly spent even if ""The Campaign"" turned out to be overall awful despite their usually good performances. But this movie wasn't bad. Not an award winner- but very much a fun time comedy with some solid laughs.This is a comedy that knows it is a comedy and stays a comedy- even when it is delivering its ""message.""I went alone to this movie and it genuinely made me laugh out loud- as it did the rest of the audience on more than a few occasions.Run out to the movies and see it though? I can't say that- but if you got some time on your hands and are convenient to a theater? Sure- go see it. As for when it comes out on some pay per view option? I would definitely recommend it. Good ""movie night"" rental."
1,"Crass, tasteless, not funny!",A total waste of money! Definitely NOT family viewing material! Hollywood should go broke if they continue to produce garbage like this! Very disappointing.
4,"Good, Not Great","Overall, a pretty decent comedy - probably in the 3-4 star range. By no means a flop, but definitely not Wedding Crashers either..."
4,Pretty funny movie with feel good ending.,"This is a typical slap-stick, raunchy comedy based on a political campaign in a small NC congressional district. I enjoyed it because the film pokes fun at the generalized rhetoric of politics as well as the impact of money in supporting campaign ads. Also, the general ridiculousness of Will Ferrell's character and the crazy Chinese maid made the film even better.Overall: Pretty funny. Worth a rental."
4,It's a funny movie,"It's a funny movie, you have to keep an open mind and really look at the theme of American politics. who is in power, what they are really doing in Washington DC, at the end Will's character says it really well, and how special interests have really ruined everything...."
4,"Funny, tho not the funniest.",What do you want me to say? It was right in Will Ferrell's wheel house. Good flick. I'll buy it.
3,funny,"Funny movie but most of the funny parts were shown in the previews. Some parts of the movie were out of place, didn't really add anything to the story."
3,Worth watching,It was amusing in places but became a bit tedious...premise wore pretty thin. Zach G's character & kids were the best part
1,"Vulgar, nasty, a waste of time",This movie could have been funny but they made it so nasty it was painful to watch. Not worth the rental fee!
2,WTF,This is one of those movies that you could have enjoyed simply by watching the previews. Too bad I just wasted 4$ discovering that.
4,Funny,"Politics have never been funnier! Will Ferrell is great as the ""bad Guy"" in this movie. Not as good as Blades of Glory but it's close."
5,Very Funny,This movie was very funny and I loved the way that Will Ferrell takes political stunts that our politicians actually pull off in subtle ways and brings the total waste that they are to us.
5,Funny,This is a really good movie. You can't go wrong with a will Ferrell movie. The baby being punched is not cut from the movie itself just in the previews.
5,Someone who bought it.,"Really great movie, also really funny ,and the best choice for when your bored in the office or anywhere really!!"
3,It's not too shabby,"I got a few laughs out of it, but overall pretty cheesy. It could be like Old School or Anchorman where it would become funnier each time I watch it, but not so sure."
1,Another bad Will Ferrell Movie,This movie did not live up to the trailers. I thnk I may have fallen asleep the first time I tried to watch it. Just another really bad Will Ferrell movie.
1,Terrible,Can say anything good about this movie. IT SUCKEDBAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD
2,just a dumb movie,this movie was at all what you think it is going to be from the previews. just a very slow unfunny movie
2,Disappointing,"This movie was very disappointing for me. I normally absolutely love Will Farrell in most movies, and Zach G. Is normally okay, but it was just all right at best. The ending was very predictable, however. Not Will Farrell's best."
2,ehhhh,"not great, might be worth the one buck price of movie vending machines. blah. ehh. nahh. nope. not this one."
4,Good movie. Will was good but Zak stole the show!,A decent Will Farrell movie. Probaly my fab from him. Zak made the move less Will like as most of his movies are pretty similar. Did a great job of showing the corruption of American politics in today's world where big buisness owns politicians. Overall a fun movie with lots of laughs but mostly from Zak and the other supporting actors.
2,What did I expect,"God I love Will Farrell and Zach Galifianakis- they don't even have to say anything and I'm hysterical. However, this movie was not worth the time to watch it. I think all the funny lines were on the previews."
2,Will Ferrell was better as a co-star back in the day.,"Ever since the days of Old School and his other movies that he co starred in, i just don'y fill Will Ferrell is all that funny anymore and his humor is mainly geared to tweens and teens that haven't graduated high school."
3,"Will Ferrell ""laughs"" but pretty average overall","Not bad movie but nothing to brag about. Considering political environment, probably to close to the truth on big money running campaigns."
2,Not funny,Jokes were not funny at all. Expected more from the two together. Only reason I watched the whole thing is because I already paid for it.
2,raunchy and not funny,Despite the funny looking trailer this movie ended up not producing one laugh for me at all. Too raunchy too!
2,The commercial was the best part,"If this were to come on TV again, I wouldn't likely watch it. I just didn't find it overly funny. They took each of the truly funny parts and put them in the commercial. There was nothing left in the movie really."
2,"Kinda funny in the beginning, but then just gets sad","The movie starts out ok and seems like it could be a good one, but then it just gets weird. We actually turned it off a little past halfway. There are a lot of parts that left me asking my self really?"
3,ok,Decent movie - a little more vulgar than I was expecting but did deliver a few laughs. Not something I would want to see again
2,The Campaign,"Was hoping for some good laughs without too much filth, well there were a few laughs but much too much profanity and vulgar scenes. The ""f"" word was used about 1,000 times!"
4,Funny,We had some good laughs with this movie-Zack and Will make a good team; Zack G. does a great job playing his part. Will is always Will in all his movies-but this one was a favorite. NOT for teens under 17!
1,Vote No,"I'm a fan of Will Ferrell, but this movie was terrible. The idea of a loud obnoxious villain vs. a good and loveable rube could have worked, only that's not how this script was written. It was more like unfunny a-hole vs. another unfunny a-hole. I didn't want to cheer for either charater, and their families were equally off-putting. The jokes about religion, adultary and 9/11 were just moronic. I feel dumber for listening to a Chinese woman act like a black slave. Here are the only funny parts: Will Ferrell punches a baby and a dog, and the podiums are different sizes, which looks funny because Will is tall and Zach is short. The other 84 minutes (total running time: 85 minutes) were a total waste."
3,Funny but not super funny,At times this movie was REALLY funny! Those were the only funny moments in the movie. The jokes were not well constructed.
2,A good sleeping pill,I was expecting much more - with all the advertising hype. I fell asleep on the movie it was so boring
4,Funny,"This is a very funny movie. Will Ferrell and Zach G. are hilarious together, definitely worth seeing this movie, its worth a Google."
4,Laugh out loud,The campaign was very funny from beginning to the end and did not disappoint me at all. Good job to the cast I love it.
3,couldhve been better,"I found tha it is a 2.5 star movie and that it had some funny parts i felt that I had seen this movie before,"
1,would have been funny but.....,This movie could have been such a great movie with a great story and funny actors but they ruined it with all of the filthy and explicit language. I am not sure why Hollywood thinks it is so appealing to make all movies so dirty that the family can't watch it!
3,My high school age son and his friends were much more impressed than I was.,My high school age son and his friends were much more impressed than my husband and I were. There were a couple of good laughs.
3,Not as fuuny as I thought it would be,"the wife and I really wanted to laugh, which we did, a little bit. We wanted ot laugh hard (stomach hurting) and that did not happen. It was fun but we were dissapointed!"
1,The Campaign,It was terrible!! The biggest waste of 90 minutes ever. We should have stopped watching. And that's coming from someone who like Will Farrell.
3,"So Much Potential, So Little Follow-Through","I wanted to like this movie. It has a funny premise, some laugh out loud moments, great leads and supporting cast. The problem with The Campaign rests in the execution and the picture as a whole. Most of the jokes are surface level funny, they might deserve a chuckle but more often, an eye roll. I think my main problem with it is an issue of restraint. Sometimes the leads are restraining too much, they were holding something back in the moments that needed over-the-top performances. In other scenes they went too big, where smaller character moments were needed.I wish we could get a do over on The Campaign because with a little tweaking it COULD become something great."
3,"Decent, but predictable","A fine rental. Not exactly Will Ferrell's finest work, but certainly not his worst either. Predictable - if you enjoy Will Ferrell and his standard faire, you'll enjoy the movie."
5,Hilarious,Very funny movie. The girlfriend and I both enjoyed the movie a lot. We watched it on Amazon's PS3 app using the 48 hour rental option.
4,I wish our real politians were this honest,"It starts of kind of hokey, but it is a much better movie than I expected. The producers of this movie manage to pull of a spoof that people of all political persuasions will enjoy."
4,Funny with real world examples,"Funny because it's true. Not as funny as Step Brothers or Old School but funny nonetheless. Only downside is the time, 1.5 hours long."
2,Not what I hoped for.,"Not as funny as expected. There were a few funny moments but, overall a bust. I would not recommend buying it. Wait until you can watch it for free!"
2,Ok.. some funny parts,"Movie was ok, most of the funny stuff was in previews. Wont bother seeing it again. I would feel better if it was rented for $1.99."
2,The Campaign,This was not a film like I thought it would be; too much vulgar talk in it. Some people may enjoy it though. To each his own.
3,Gratuitis vulgarity,"isn't necessary for a funny movie, however will is degrading his credentials taking this stuff. Guess he needs the work?"
4,EPIC,Some movies show great trailers and then you discover they literally took all of the greatness and put it into 30 seconds. That is NOT the case here. We laughed the whole way through. Great movie and by no means child appropriate so don't even consider it.
1,Disgusting,This was more filth from Will Ferrell and it's a shame he continues to make money from these disgusting films. Absolutely terrible.
1,Waste of $5....,"I was expecting a lot more from this movie. It was a grave disappointment from two very talented actors. I think if I could give it negative stars, I would."
1,Don't Recommend,The best parts of the movie are in the preview. I didn't stay awake for the whole movie and was not disappointed that I missed it.
1,No good,Language was awful and just plain stupid movie. I had hoped it would be funny and cute I was wrong
1,sucky,"Will Ferrell has just gotten worse and worse for me. He needs to try serious dramas for a while, stat!"
3,Not as funny.as I.thought.,I.love Will Ferrell and countless times I hope his movies will.make me hurt with laughter like Step Brothers and I was disappointed with this movie because all the funny parts were already commercials.
2,Not Will or Zach's best,"I really thought this was going to be funnier than it was. The idea seemed very funny, but I never laughed once. I just found it stupid. I do think both of these actors are very funny but this wasn't their movie, probably due to a poor script."
2,"bias, bias, and more bias","I am not sure why I ever expect any intellectual honesty from hollywood. I was hopeful that there would be at least some humor representative of both sides, but this may as well have been sponsored by the Democratic party.That being said, the jokes aimed at the Right were very funny and there were quite a few good laughs from this movie. That's why it gets at least two stars."
3,Disappointed..,"I purchased this for my girlfriend, who loved the movie but, was Very disappointed that the part where Marty says "" I didn't know if it was push or pull"", was not in either cut! One of the better parts of the movie, not to mention the part of trash talking, about his mother."
2,What a waste of talent.,"There are some really funny moments, but they are loosely strewn between pointless and poorly crafted story elements. These two comedic actors are almost worth the price of admission on their own, but the film making is so bad, that the laughs simply can not be sustained. One star for Will and one for Zach."
3,Okay for a Will Ferrel movie,"It's Will Ferrell doing his same character, albet a little more grown up. Decent watch. Not a buy, definitely a rent."
4,Way Better Than I Expected,Although parts of it are sophmoric for the most part this was a cleverly written script and the performances are good. I even laughed out loud a few times. Fun and entertaining.
2,The language was terrible; that's what ruined it.,"We rarely go to the movies because we are convinced that Hollywood produces a lot of 'crap'.Hollywood did nothing here to change my mind.This could have been a very good movie.The language was terrible; that's what ruined it.Only the most benighted people speak like this.Clean up the language, and it would get 3 1/2 stars."
3,Pretty funny,"Not the best Ferrell movie i've seen, but watchable. Galifanackis is always funny. Not sure I'd recommend it to a friend, but I thought it was good."
4,Surprised,"I liked this movie. It was funny throughout and was particularly hilarious, but it was continually funny. Good movie watch it"
3,Amusing enough,"It's good for when you don't have any other movie you want really see, but you just want to be amused for a while."
3,Amazon prime rental,"I rented this through Amazon Prime and ended up not paying full attention to it. It was a little boring, and though it had some funny parts, it was a bit disappointing."
3,to much,the comedy was lacking.hear it was very funny not.the acting by will ferell was sub par and the story was a disaster
3,"OK, but too over the top","This flick is good for some laughs, and I'm good with R-rated humor, but I thought there was a bit too much raunchiness in this one. It would have been better had the plot been at least somewhat believable. Otherwise, it's OK, just don't expect anything too good."
1,waste of time,"Predictable, very few funny moments, we struggled through.. Normally we like Will Ferrel. He should be more picky about the movies he is in these days."
1,Incredibly stupid,"I'll admit, I dont like Will Ferrell in the first place. I watched this anyway because the trailers made it look like it was a stupid/funny kind of movie. Well, it had some funny but it was overwhelmed by the stupid. I was also put-off by the amount of needless profanity, especially the F-word. My husband, who loves Will Ferrell and stupid movies, also hated it."
1,Don't Waste Your Hard Earned Money,Two of comedies best are more than lack luster in this poor scripted and not funny movie. The attempt to use foul language and base humor falls flat.
3,The Campaign,This movie had funny parts. I'm glad I didn't go to the theater to see it. Zack Galifinakis is always funny.
1,Don't waste your time and $,"With a cast featuring Will Ferrell and Zach Galifinakis, I had high hopes for a knee slapping comedy. Boy, was I wrong! Not only was this movie completely laughable (not in a good way) but it was nasty beyond belief. I'm not a prude, by any means, but Will Ferrell's character was beyond dirty. This movie was disappointing. I am thankful that I had a free rental and didn't have to spend my heard earned $ on it because I would have demanded a refund!"
1,Awful Movie,"One of the more horrible Will Ferrell movies. Good concept, but poor writing and stupid sexual references. Wish it would have been better."
3,Funny enough,"Liked it enough for three stars.Two super funny scenes are when Marty gets his kids at the dinner table to cough up all the things that they have done that are wrong...and boy are they wrong things, and the scene where the baby gets punched in slow-mo.That's it that's my review.I would imagine most would like it but hey I'd suggest renting first as is usually the best practice with hit or miss comedies.Three stars...nothing to crazy but entertaining just the same."
1,Crude,"I expect a certain level of crassness from these two actors which is usually tempered with their great senses of humor and amazing ablility to go ""off-script"" and adlib brilliantly. However this one went above and beyond their usual over-the-top movies. Really, how many F-bombs and sexually explicit jokes can one movie pack into the first 10 minutes?....which is exactly how long I watched before turning it off."
1,The worst movie I've ever seen.,I usually like will Ferrell's movies but this one is humorless and offensive. I can't believe I wasted $5 renting this. The only reason I'm writing this is in hopes that others don't make the same mistake.
1,What happened to Will Ferrell?,"What do you get when you cross two of the most notable comedic geniuses of this generation and a premise that writes itself? Oh... Apparently crap. I wished I could have found two ferns to hide between to get away from this movie. It's over the top, dirty without being funny and has absolutely no emotional hook. If you're one of the millions of people who apparently religiously watch Big Bang Theory, you'll love this movie."
2,Expectations too high,"I saw the previews and thought the movie woukd be funny. I was pretty disappointed. As a result, I did not finish the movie."
2,X-rated,"foul language & behavior, too many cliches and predictable ending. This could have been a funny movie, instead the went for shock impact."
2,Not as funny as we had hoped,"Jokes were too few and too far apart--most were in trailer. With this cast you should expect, and get, more."
2,The Campaign,"This moving was a big let down. The plot was pointless, and the humor was lacking. Not at all one of their best works (Will and Zach)."
3,Ok for a laugh....,"The Campaign was ok. At some points it was hilariously funny. At other points it was absolutely over the top and I was cringing/disgusted. Honestly, it's Will Ferrell in another costume. If you don't might over the top crude humor this is for you. If you're like me and like humor that has more of an intelligent edge to it, then I would not recommend this."
3,It was ok,"Worth watching if there is nothing else on. Not one of Ferrells best movies, but not one of his worst."
3,"Potential for greatness is drowned by ""no limits humor.""","There's no doubt in my mind that Ferrell and Galifainakis could have taken this movie ""down a notch"" and made it funnier without resorting to ""doggy-style-freezer-door"" punchlines. This is tricky, though.When you place limits on these dudes, you may not get the gut-destroying-laughter of the ""slo-mo-baby-punch."" These two actor/comedians are masters at subtlety. I would have liked more scenes like the ""ambush brunch"" and the ""office staff melt down."""
2,"Love both these actors, but the movie was just not funny.","The preview was funnier than the movie, and it was not very funny. I do not recommend it, the jokes were tired & outdated."
1,"Terrible, not worth rental","Very disappointing movie. Tired and repetitive stereotypes, very unoriginal for a great opportunity during election year. In fact this movie reminds me of our economy, not going anywhere but down."
4,"""GREAT SATIRE, GREAT ACTING, ENTERTAINING!""","'The Campaign' is very funny and entertaining from start to finish. Rated-R, and Acting Performance Superb. Of course, the political ads are laugh-out-loud fun, and ads like we have never seen before. The roles of the men who wish to get in office makes you laugh, but also makes you think about the what if in real life as you ponder if anyone with personalities such as a few the film portrayed could actually be elected to office. Overall, as a comedy, it's a great summer movie to get some laughs and enjoy. Highly Recommended for all those who love satire and fun-filled comedy!"
2,Classic Will Ferrell,"Ok so it's not one of his best movies and I wouldn't watch it again, but it was funny.. though I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Funny...,"Certainly more enjoyable to watch than the recent presidential campaigns. Great fun trying to identify which past politicians were parodied the most--we think Bill Clinton and John Edwards were parodied the most, followed closely by George Bush (Jr.)"
4,Funny,"To far ""over the rainbow"" ending for my taste, but still funny. The duo has some real promise, hope they do more together."
4,"Cute, funny and timely - Afun Amazon streaming movie",This was a slightly slapstick but none-the-less insightfull movie about our political system - and how (with only a slight exaggeration - but a funny one) it actually MIGHT WORK!!!! An entertaining video.
3,CAMPAIGN,"The movie was funny but as usual Will Farrell ruined it with filthy language, that wasn't necessary to go to that extreme..it would have been funnier had the language been more tame..Zack Galafanakis (sp) is the best"
4,Funny and worrying,"This is not a movie masterpiece, it is a Will Ferrell movie so anyone expecting more than a hilarious movie will be disappointed. I watched this the weekend before the US elections and it was the perfect timing to get all the subtle and not so subtle jokes. The spin, the makeovers, the voting machines produced by the candidates son! My husband is not a fan of Will Ferrell but he laughed out loud throughout this movie and declared it a hit.It was slightly worrying for real life though as a lot of what they were joking about seems to be happening in real life politics as well.A good, light hearted, funny movie. Not award winning so if you are a movie snob/buff then don't bother but if you want to pass an evening with some laughter then give it a try.and, no, I still do not understand the American political system!"
3,Great comedy but dont get the HD,"This is comedy is quite funny and worth the money. I do recommend to watch it, although its not worth to get the HD quality because its just as bad as SD."
1,unfunny,I love both leading men but if you are expecting to laugh throughout the movie you will be as disappointed as I was.
2,All right for guys and high school sophomores.,I should have known going in that this movie would be a typical Will Ferrell adolecent male comedy. (I use the word comedy loosely.) A ton of profanity and cheap attempt at laughs. There are better movies out their. Please don't waste your time and monsy on this one.
5,=]],I absolutely loved this movie. Will Farrell owns my comic soul. I'm recommending this to everyone. the world must know.
4,funny funny,hilarious movie! it came out when the presidential campaigning and was based on reality but in a comedic way. sad part is most of it is mostly true in more ways then most people realize.
3,a good renter,"Funny, but not nearly as funny as I had hoped/expected. Best line in the movie: the one about The Price is Right."
4,Funny but wasn't in hysterics,Not as good as funny as some of Will Ferrell or Zach Galifianakis' other movies but still a good chuckle!
1,Another Ferrell Mess!,"I simply don't understand the appeal of Will Ferrell! He's just awful! This movie is about as entertaining as a root canal, but MORE painful! Zach Galifianakis gives one of the most effeminate performances by a hetero man ever!! There's nothing funny in this so-called comedy! Don't waste your money or time on this one!"
3,Funny,This movie was very funny but extremely stupid. There really isn't much else to be said about this movie than that.
1,Raunchy and sexist. Not impressed.,"I was so determined to see this movie even though it had so many negative reviews. But I rented it and got about an hour into it and turned it off. Not only is raunchy language used carelessly and distastefully, the movie's portrayal of women is low and unacceptable. They are repeatedly portrayed as sex-crazed and brainless. I don't know about other people, but that's not funny to me. Also, the funniest parts of the movie were shown in the trailer, the rest of the film drags. Poking fun at bad behavior, religion, and politics can be done in good taste for a laugh, but here it's just crude and cruel, and the genuine laughs are limited to just a few scenes. Don't waste your time."
2,Strategery,"This was a movie that I could only laugh at. The portraying of politicians is funny, and sometimes seems like really life, but I will not be adding this movie to my favorites collection anytime soon."
2,So bad,This movie was so bad. I can't believe it has so many stars. There were only a few laughable moments and my wife was falling asleep.
5,too funny!,"One you get past the foul language, which there's plenty, it's very funny. My husband and I would watch again."
4,Pretty funny,Pretty funny movie. Highlights all of the ridiculousness of political campaigns. Will Ferrell is over the top funny as always.
5,"Expected good, was better than that.","On a comedy like this, you know what to expect... Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis (yes, I have to copy-paste his last name to spell it right) are so darn funny, you know you'll have a good time.But then, while the film runs, you start noticing there is an actual plot unravelling... not the most amazing plot ever, of course... but quite an interesting one! I liked it a lot. Their backgrounds, and the conclusion, were really, really cool."
3,Funny but average.,Good jokes here and there but a lot of the funniest moments were in the commercials. Don't expect too much and it will be a good comedy to watch some night.
2,"Funny, sort of","The basic story premise was funny with a lot of unexpected outcomes. What diminished the humor was the overuse of the F-bomb, X-rated language and sexual scenes, which if deleted would still have rendered the movie hilarious and viewable by a wider audience range."
1,Had to turn it off...,Not worth the money. Movie is just full of untastefull humor and we ended up turning off the movie after about 30 min
2,wow do i feel like a prude!,very few funny moments hidden amongst nasty filthy jokes. - can't believe i wasted $4 and my time watching that.
2,slow....,"Just not big laughs, all good scenes are in the trailer........ Lil boring. If u havr nothing else to watch its ok"
2,Disappointed,I thought this movie would be better but it was not. Insipid and silly is about it. Do not recommend.
3,Will Farrell is Hillarious,"Overall, not an academy award winner. But a nice relaxing afternoon movie to escape for a little while. We really enjoy most Will Farrell movies."
3,Great parody on today's political process. Of course some it may be true,The movie was very entertaining. I think they should do one about the lack of ability to compromise in House for the past 4 years.
3,Cursing. . . . Why?,"I would have given this movie 4 stars except the cursing was too much and unnecessary. Believe me when I tell ya, I say my fair share of curse words, but this was taken way over the top. This definitely needed to toned down a bit."
2,Ridiculous and Plain Bad,"Ridiculous and Plain Bad. A few jokes got a chuckle out of me, but the movie devolves to silly and ridiculous outcomes."
5,Funny,"I laughed for most parts of the movie. Both play great at there parts. Will watch it again, ""can't is the real c word"""
3,"Starts off funny, then...","Its a funny and very offensive movie to most folks, Will Ferrell at his most offensive.At first it is a fun movie making fun of the whole political process, then it goes towards a very deeply liberal/left slant, bewarned."
4,Worth a watch,"It wasn't original but if you enjoy these guys as I do, it'll make you laugh out loud a few times. Good but far from great."
3,Meh...,Meh... Not the best of either actor in this humdrum movie. I'm just glad I rented it instead of buying it.
1,stupid movie,"not funny. It was 2 hrs I'll never get back. If I wasn't so cheap, I'd have quit watching after 10 minutes."
3,Meh...,"Alright movie with a decent amount of funny parts. Felt more like a rerun of Talledega Nights (sp?). Also, it got really weird in some parts that were definitely not suitable for kids or myself for that matter. It was OK all in all but wouldn't pay for it, wait for netflix."
2,So disappointed,"The best thing about this cornball movie was seeing my great nephew, Dustin Costine play the cop! The rest was just to ""Saturday Night Live-ish!!'"
4,Funny movie,This movie was funny until the end and would recommend it to others. Will Ferrell and Zach Galifinakis are awesome together.
2,Will Ferrell passed his peak a long time ago,"This was another one of the movies I watched that looked funny from the preview, and I did find a couple funny moments but really found that the humor just wasn't there. This isn't the right kind of movie for young teens, like your 13 year old kids, at least I wouldn't have my kids watch it when they were that young. I really must say that the first couple movies I saw Will Ferrell in he seemed very funny, but the most of the latest ones he is in like this one just make me wish I never watched them. I like to remember him as a funny guy who made me enjoy laughing with my family in Elf, not tasteless brainless crap encouraging or glorifying bad social behavior. maybe I am missing something, but trying to make humor of punching a baby, and dog by accident just didn't work in anyway you try."
1,Video quality poor,"Purchased as streaming video. Video quality was poor. Decided to stop watching. Maybe hd would be ok, but standard video was unsat."
2,Disturbed,Not as funny as I expected. In some cases just down right dirty. I mean disgusting. Watch if you dare or save your money.
2,Crude and stupid,"This movie was overall ""meh"" take it or leave it. It started out decent and I had plenty of laughs but Will Farrel's character was over the top and got very annoying very fast. I was happy when this movie ended."
3,Too much needless foul language.,Would have been just as funny without all the foul language and then I could have watched it with the grandkids. Otherwise would rate it higher.
3,"Ehh, I was expecting better.","Title sums it up. Huge fan of both Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis and while the movie was decent, I guess I was expecting more. Hopefully they'll make another together. This wasn't bad and definitely watchable but should have been great."
3,Does funny have to be so profane?,Funny but the profanity was tiresome. It makes me wonder if people get cash back for every f bomb. This movie would have been funny without all the prolonged bad language but maybe I am the last remaining person to think that way.
2,Crap,"Another Will Ferrell schlocky film... Unless you got time and money to burn... No, don't do it even if you have time and money to burn."
1,I had to leave mid-way through the movie,"I am sorry but this movie was extremely disgusting. Why all the cursing and why all the stupid and gross sexual jokes? I've watched Will Farrell's ""Land of The Lost"" and ""Bad Guys"" and I must say that they are not even remotely as vulgar as ""The Campaign"". The whole movie proceeded with mocking Christianity and displaying total family deterioration coupled with vulgar language beyond even worldly norms accepted nowadays."
1,Aweful,"Aweful. I've always been a fan of Will Ferrell, but it seems that He'll no longer do any comedy movies that won't be trying too hard to be crass. Granted I'm still a fan of Talladega Nights and Anchor Man, seems the roles he's been cast in are just trying to rehash those same characters into a new more disgusting mold. I wouldn't waist your time. There were some funny parts, but none of them made up for the lack of thought put into this movie. No subtle jokes and a truck load of in-your-face crude joking that I probably too often extend my patience for because I've been a fan of Will Ferrell. The more I think of this movie the more I wonder why I didn't turn it off mid-way through."
1,These guys are funny,"Alone. Sometimes. Not here. (Sixteen more words are required, I think I'll list adjectives for this movie... formulaic, flat, tired.)"
3,Disappointing considering the cast,"Expected a little more from this movie, especially from Will Ferrell. There were some funny moments but really glad I rented and didn't buy. Wouldn't watch it again if we're on cable."
4,Worth the time,Not the greatest but if thats what you expect when you see will farrell and zack gilifinakis then i really feel sorry for your sense of judgment.THese two are great at STUPID humor. Which this movie is about.Kept my fiance and I laughing throughout with no real boring parts or elongated scenes to make you snoooze w/o knowing it. Story line is very simple but for the time of year it fits the script.Enjoy
3,Very silly and funny at times.,"The Campaign had it's moments. It was funny enough to be worth it, but too silly to recommend. Zach Galifianakis was the stand out as well as Katherine LaNasa playing Will Ferrel's wife."
3,It's okay,"All the funny moments of the movie were, once again, put in the commercials. But, still a funny movie...typical Will Ferrell."
3,Not the best...,I wasn't impressed at all. Laughed some. Thought the movie was a little stupid. I really hope this isn't how politics actually works.
3,Had its moments,"Overall it was okay, plot was lacking and I was hoping for a bit more out of Ferrell and Galifianakis."
2,Not funny,I like these two great comic actors but sadly neither shined in this movie and the script didn't give them much to work with either. It simply wasn't a very good movie.
4,much funnier than anticipated!,"as a southerner and will ferrell/zach g. fan, i thoroughly enjoyed this movie. it is stupid, of course, but you already know that if you're thinking of watching it. also fun for people from NOLA to play i-spy for set locations."
3,It had its moments,"This was a funny movie, with the usual over-the-top scenes and if you enjoy either of these actors this is worth a viewing. Wouldn't own it but fun one to rent."
4,Funny - good pace,"Overall, a funny movie if you like these comedians. Like most movies like this - they get better the more you see them and catch all of the jokes."
2,Stupid and not funny,I am not sure what happened to Will Ferrell 's recent pictures. I used to love Anchor man and his earlier works. This one is just plain stupid. I tried to squeeze a laugh and just couldn't. My wife fell asleep watching it.
4,The smiting game of dirty politics,"""The Campaign"" is a raucous comedy genre film which underlines foul play and insincere electioneering, as a means to win at all costs.Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) and Marty Huggins (Zack Galifianakis) display a double-barrel wit hit on screen, playing off against each other as political opponents.The cast also offers veteran laugh doctors with John Lithgow and Dan Aykroyd in supporting roles as the corrupt Motch brothers.The movie is stacked with no-limits style humour from Ferrell and Galifianakis, which combines to present the viewer with a loutish laugh out loud special.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
1,Bad,"Very profane and gross. Not funny at all. Very predictable plot, and flat character development. The part where the sons are ""coming clean"" at the dinner table is disturbing and unfunny, children being sexually explicit is inappropriate. I could not finish this movie."
1,Filthy Language,"Couldn't watch it! Not appropriate for a family! Why can't Hollywood understand that we don't need to hearthe ""F""word every other word!"
2,Bottom shelf humor,"This movie is not as bad as some in this genre, but absolutely nothing unique, creative or redeeming about this movie."
4,Pretty funny,Same movie different story. Liked it...it was still funny. Not as funny as some of the others they've been in.
4,Will and Zach in a very funny parody,"Adult based humor, but to bad that a mid teenager cannot watch it. Classic Will Ferrell and Zach brings a nice mix to the equation."
1,Amazon video will not play!,I have been watching video at home with play station and Apple TV without any problems. I have paid for a prime membership to watch amazon video and to get free shipping. It is very rare to get free shipping and to be able to watch a movie all the way through without it buffering most the way through the movie. I have no idea why movies play better on the other streaming companies. You have a much better chance of finding an item with free shipping on eBay.
2,Too few laughs,"I knew that there would be a lot of sophmoric humor in this film, hopefully like Old School, but there were surprisingly few laughs. Will Ferrell just wasn't funny. He missed it on this one. Oh well."
2,Adolescent Foul Language Fury,"This looked funny in the promos - enjoyed the cameos of CNN/MSNBC hosts. Unfortunately, this goes way overboard on foul language. The F-word, the M word - all totally unnecessary. I'm disappointed that Will Ferrell and other veteran actors in this movie would stoop to that kind of language."
1,Nonsensical,"Before you rent/buy this film, lower your expectations in all areas: acting, direction, storyline. It is simply inane without any planned, or otherwise, laughs. Jay Roach is not at his best"
2,"Beware The Misleading ""Digital Copy""","Four stars for the movie, zero stars for the misleading ""digital copy"". The movie itself is typical Will Ferrell - funny in most parts, lacking in a few others. However, DO NOT BE FOOLED by the ""digital copy"" claim. Yes, it's a ""cloud copy"" - but it's not iTunes compatible. So, you can watch it on an iPhone, or iPad, or a laptop, etc. - as long as you're streaming it. And, if you're not on Wi-Fi, you'll eat up your data requirements watching this moving, as it will stream in HD. So, if you're on a plane, or in your car, whatever - you're either out of luck, or burning a lot of data to watch it. So, if you're buying it for the ""digital copy"", buy it at your own risk."
5,Enjoyable,This movie is very funny especially with all the intense election stuff going on at the present time. There are some really funny scenes over all
3,It Should Have Been Better,"This film just should have been better. The acting was rock solid so that wasn't the problem. The actors were also all pretty damn good so that wasn't the problem. The problem is that the script just didn't pop. It wasn't polished and probably needed another revision. Also, the directing/direction of the film isn't quite right. Comedy is a very fickle artform and everything has to be ""just right"" and with this film it just felt a touch off.There are tons of funny moments in the film and its worth seeing if you are into politics at all and enjoy The Daily Show or Colbert Report...But overall, this film just should have been funnier and I feel a real opportunity was missed here."
2,WF was funny... but Zach no,"looked so promising, but so disappointing! WF was hilarious, but ZG... wtf was the point of his character to be Kip from Nap. Dynamite?? because that is exactly what he was (sounded like anyway). save yourself the 2 hours and don't watch this."
2,Could have been good,this film had such potential but just was not made right. WF always funny but the other guy seems to be a one trick pony.
3,Mediocre at Best,"I'm a huge Will Ferrell and Zach Galifinakis fan. I dig pretty much all of their movies. This wasn't one that I was particularly fond of, though. Don't get me wrong... there were some parts that I cracked up over. They were few and far between, and some parts even left you feeling weirded out. Seeing this once was enough for me."
4,The Campaign,The Campaign with Will Farrell and Zach G. was entertaining. I usually don't like either of these actors because I find them to be a bit over the top. They did a good job in this movie.
2,"Movie was ok, but the quality of Amazon streaming was just horrible","What Amazon calls HD (1080) is 420 at best. Very blurry, poor quality streaming, complete rip-off. Other movie streaming services like Vudu and Netflix provide much better quality (on the same device and internet speed) for comparable prices."
4,Entertaining,"As painful as these two actors are to watch, this was quite entertaining to watch. You might enjoy this movie."
3,Quick laugh,Predicable funny. Good for a quick laugh. Not for ownership. Once was enough. Usual type of movie for these tow actors
3,Amusing,This is midly amusing and very funny at times but thats about it. I dont think I would recommend it
3,Few Good Laughs,"We had a few good laughs while watching this movie, but its just not the same as the old Will Ferrell movies (Old School, Anchorman, etc.) Not sure I would say its worth renting for $4.95, maybe for $1.95."
4,Hilarious,I thought this movie was very funny. It has a lot of adult content. Both actors were fantastic and surreal.
3,Eh.,I was hoping for more but this one kind of slacked its way through comedy. Not either of the star's best work.
3,It was ok...,I laughed....but sometimes it was too over the top for me. It's got a lot of swearing for no real reason which doesn't make me laugh as much as stupid humor in general. Overall it was just a Ferrell ok movie.
3,Tries hard to make you laugh - succeed at times and fail at times!,Could have been more funnier - may be one time watch! Tries hard to make you laugh - succeed at times and fail at times!
5,Hilarious Movie,This movie was one of the funniest movies I have seen this year and was a great way to end the 2012 political season.
2,Was expecting more from two big actors,"This star rating is strictly for the actual movie and not the streaming quality. As usual, I give Amazon 5 stars for picture and sound quality on the HD streaming to my PS3.As for the movie, it has a lot to be desired. I was hoping for big laughs here and instead got a few chuckles. Nothing more than a truck load of sexual jokes and bad humor that involves punching a baby. Not funny in my book. I've liked Zach Galafianakis in his previous work and Will is generally funny but this movie just didn't work for me. I felt it was loaded with cheap humor and the writers really didn't dig very deep to get some good material to represent the talent of these two actors. If you still want to watch it, I'd wait till it lands on the bargain basement rental."
3,Not will ferrals best,Im a huge fan of will ferral and zack so I thought this might be the funniest movie I'd have seen in a long time. The movie is funny and you most likely will laugh if you like will ferrals type of humor or his other movies. But the movie does not hold up well the jokes and timing only work if your going to rent it and just watch it once a second viewing the jokes are not funny and the shock value is gone. I reccomend this as a rent to any will ferral fan I don't think any one should purchase this movie.
3,Unnecessarily Vulgar,"This could have been a good, funny movie, but unfortunately there was a lot of unnecessary vulgar. It would have been just as funny without some of the filth."
1,Desperately unfunny,"This is what happens when writers mistake ""raunchy"" for ""funny."" You'd think a movie with a political plot and starring some of the most clever actors around couldn't be this yuk-yuk-look-how-fat-that-chick-is dumb, but you'd be wrong. It represents new career low points for Will Ferrell, Zach Galifinakis & Jason Sudekis, who seem like they're in a contest to see who can make the audience wince the most with one mean-spirited, unfunny, dumb & dirty joke after another. The story's resolution is no more satisfying than the jokes - redemption comes not through moral discovery but through eye-rollingly phony plot twists, because it's time to wrap this thing up."
2,Not family friendly because of the language.,"I am twenty some year old, and was told by my friend that this is a funny movie. So I ordered it to watch with my parents over Christmas break, and it shocked me with overwhelming cursing words, and I felt embarrassed while watching it with my parents on my side.The story is alright, and you can enjoy with your (young) friends, but definitely not with conservative parents. Also, it is more stupid than funny to me."
3,Meh!,"Two extremely funny men doing what they do. Not their best work, but not bad at all.... just funny as you would expect."
4,Good but not great,"For someone like me, Will Ferrell & Zach Galifianakis in the same movie sounded like a dream team. I can't say I was let down, however I still don't think the movie was as good as it could've been. The movie was hilarious i'm not doubting that, just fell a bit short for me, still worthy of 4 stars though. Zach Galifianakis really shines in the film, he plays the lovable character very well and Ferrel pulls off the corrupt politician. I don't really know how to pinpoint the one reason this one didn't fully do it for me though. I guess I just had too high of expectations, being big fans of both of these guys. Still, I don't regret seeing the film and if you're a fan of either one of these men you shouldn't be let down either."
2,meh,"there were some funny parts, but overall it was below average. i thought it would have been funnier with Will Farrell and Zach Galifianakis"
2,This movie seemed funny,But it really didn't have the substance to pull of what it set put to do. All in all not worth watching
3,"Funny, but not hilarious","This is not Will Ferrell's greatest movie, but it is likeable. Zach Galifianakis plays a role similar to his fake twin-brother ""Seth Galifianakis"". It made me laugh, but it was not laugh out loud funny like Anchorman or the Hangover."
1,As if two twelve-year-old boys made a movie.,"I was hoping for a lighthearted laugh, quite aware that there would be some silliness, swearing, and potty humor. What we saw was an entirely gratuitous collection of profanity, un-funny one-liners, and disappointing characters. Not only did we not laugh, I don't believe we cracked a smile the whole time. Pfffft. Horrible."
2,What a wasted opportunity,"Such a promising cast and premise, but it just spins almost immediately beyond a parody of the outrageous contemporary American political theater into self parody."
1,didnt like,was not what it seem to be like in the perviews it was a tad funny but not like the will ferrell i seen in other movies.
2,meh,Not as funny as I was hoping...I feel like the humor seemed very lazy and could have been much better with a little more effort.
2,Worst Will Ferrell movie,"Not worth the time to watch it or the money to rent it. The trailer has 80% of the funny scenes in it, so watch that and move on."
3,'meh,"Take it or leave it. Love both comedians, and love politics. I guess I was hoping for a bit more out of this movie. I found it to be kind of flat. It's cute to rent and waste a couple of hours, but nothing to get excited about. Certainly not a 'must-see' by any stretch."
3,Not one of their best,"I love both these actors, but just was not feeling this one. I think they are both very funny, but not together!"
2,"""Eh"" Type movie","Started off funny and tapered off at the end. If te laughs kept coming then maybe the rating would be higher but it was just ""eh""."
2,Is it just me?,"Is it just me, or did all these slapstick movies get more vulgar since I was a kid. There were redeeming 1 lines and great laughs in movies like Wedding Crashers, Old School, Tommy Boy, etc... These new ones have gone to a new place that is less funny and just more vulgar, maybe its me."
1,Vulgar and completely lacking funny moments,The trailers do not do this movie justice. They showed every funny part in the trailer and left us disappointed that we watched the movie.
2,Not Very Good,"The most amusing part of this movie is how they parody the real division in our political system, but once you get beyond that the movie comes across as kind of stupid with a few amusing parts thrown in here and there. I like Will Ferrell, but he does basically the same thing in almost every movie and its become old news. They had the potential to do so much more with this, but it ended up being a mediocre movie that you might rent and watch on a night when you don't really have anything else to do."
3,Eh,"It was ok, not as funny as I expected, and a little more stupid than the previews made it out to be."
2,Waste of brain cells,"Could have been smart and clever like Talladega Nights. It's not, pathetic pandering and stereotypical 1 dimensional characters. Ferril can do better."
2,Left wing crapp,Hollywood trying to look bipartisan but showing the only bug business they really love is themselves. Vulgar humor not even really that funny. If you are looking for Anchor man you will be disappointed
5,very funny,this was a flick i had rented and laughed so hard i had to buy it and im happy i got it here
4,funny,good comedy for a rainy day. the acting surprised me (good)I enjoyed it the whole way thru. no FF parts
