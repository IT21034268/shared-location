4,very good,I thought that it was very good but theItalian version was superb.I still give this a 4 star
4,Great!,Great CD. This is almost as good as the original French musical. It was very well adapted and the choice of songs really sums up the entire musical.
4,Although the French is better The English is good,"As a real fan of the musical and the French version, I think the English is still excellent. I have to admit prejudice toward Garou and the original Garou/LaVoie/Fiori Belle. However the translation of Belle I thought was fantastic. I only wish they'd brought out the whole show on CD. I've seen the show, seen the performers repeatedly on French TV. I can't help thinking Noa makes the best Esmeralda, however. Can't agree that it's flat, but it is slightly different from the French."
3,A little short,The overall quality of this dvd is good. The video contains some good advices and will be a good starter if you are not familiar with a bandsaw.The video is relatively short but a lot of topics are addressed probably too much.The first part which explains how to tune your saw is too short and lack details.
5,A pleasure for musical theatre and cabaret enthusiasts.,"Alison Fraser is one of the great actresses of the contemporary musical theatre, and this CD gives a great sample of her talent and appeal. For musical theatre fans, the inclusion of a ""lost track"" from William Finn's ""In Trousers"" is a real bonus -- and Fraser's performance is sharp, funny, and touching all at once. If you enjoy musical theatre/cabaret song stylings, this album will be a true pleasure."
4,A bit of everything,"Alison Fraser has a great command of a range of American popular song styles, and shows it on this well-stocked album. If you have enjoyed her work on Broadway cast albums then you definitely need to hear her on this record. I especially liked the commentary and the arrangemnts of different songs into medleys...it gave me a real sense of connection to this dynamic and talented performer's personality."
3,An odd collection of stories in the Creepshow tradition.,"This movie is interesting if you're a fan of the Creepshow movie. 5 tales, each with a bit of wit are quick and to the point. The best one is ""Coffee Break"" about a rock and roll boy who gets trapped in a mountain town. vincent price appears as narrator only in this film."
5,the rancher and his unexpected daughter,sherryl woods is a wonderful writer this is a part of a series she has wrote this book is wonderful. it is funny and sad at parts. but it gets to the truth about life for alot of people.if you read this book you have to get the rest of the series. i know because thats how it was for me and now i own the hole series.
5,"The ins and outs of personas, a must read","It is clearly one of the best books on webdesign, a compulsory one on any IA's or IxD's bookshelf.What I liked:- the insights this book gives you are instantly actionable, it is really a step-by-step guide- the authors discuss the topics that are relevant to persona creation (and take it literally, there is great information on survey design, how to segment results, what sources to use to find a photo for your persona, etc.)- you will find good real world examples- the book shows multiple approaches based on different needs and constraints- the copywriting is also outstanding, no nonsense and easy to digestWhat I didn't like:I am trying hard but really can't think of anything :)"
5,As Advertised!,"CD was great, and entire order/receipt process was swift and without any hastle. Just what I look for and expect from a quality sight like Amazon.com!"
1,"These run very small, not true to size, too short, narrow.","I have purchased Daniel Green slippers for years, and am usually very happy with them. The problem with this style is that I had to return them (thankfully, Amazon has very easy, fast returns) due to the slipper being too short, tight, narrow. I am disappointed in how short, narrow they are and even though I ordered a size up, still too small. I would not recommend them for elderly, or frail family members as the wedge heel is relatively high and they could cause a fall. These are not that attractive in black, so found nothing ""glamorous"" about these mules. Buyer beware."
1,Run Small,"I had to return the shoes. Too narrow, too small. I couldn't even venture a guess on what size would be accurate."
3,This book left a lot unanswered questions.,"This was an interesting book to read. I thought the purpose was to reveal ""Selena's"" secret. It dwelled on suspicions but nothing substancial. Let's just say; ""Selena rest in peace""."
4,Monie,"I think it was an ok book it talked a little bit about Selena,Yolanda, and the trail the thing I didn't like about it was that it didn't say Selena's real secret I mean I bought the book to know Selena's secret but it wan't there!"
5,i have this book,i have this book selena secret and i read it over a thousand times and the secret is based on her death and if you are a selena fan any where around the world you should buy this book
5,"son unos de los mejores productos estan chupi ,,chupi","todo chupi CHUPI ,,,,TODO TAN BIEN AMAZON HACE FELIZ A TODA LAS PERSONAS ,,,,,OBTEN TU TAMBIEN LOS ARTICULOS SON FABULOSSOS ,,,JOAN BRANDON ,,,,BARCELONA ESPAÃ‘A ....AMZON ES DE TODOS ,,,,,,,CON SUS GRANDES DESCUENTOS Y FABULOSOS ARTICULOS DE PRIMERA CALIDAD ,,,SALUDOS Y A PASARLO BIEN AMIGOS ,,,,,DEU,,,,DEU,,,"
4,"A MUST READ BOOK - balanced, unbiased account of the facts",Arraras has managed to provide an unbiased and balanced account of the circumstances surrounding the death of Selena. The fans dont like it because it tackles the hard questions. A literary masterpiece this isn't. Arraras is no 'E.A.Poe' but then it is her first attempt at writing. Some of the dates are inconsistent with court transcriptions but on the whole it is quite accurate. The interview with Yolanda was very revealing. Arraras' line of questioning was clever and it was this chapter that changed my mind about the level of Yolanda's innocence. She made too many mistakes. A must for the person who is not too emotionally attached.
1,"Save Your Money, What the heck is the secret?","I bought this book--along with Joe Nick Patoski's biography of Selena and Remembering Selena--in 1997 (along with every Selena recording I could get my hands on, that was the year I fell in love with her, but I digress...). It's the least informative of the three, and by book's end, I was still wondering just what the book's title was referring to, because Ms. Arraras didn't spell it out! Given that the author--then host of Univision's Primer Impacto--constantly refers to herself, I can't help but feel that the book is less Selena's story than a self-promotional piece. The only useful part of the book is a translated text of Arraras' interview (or at least a portion of it) with Selena's murderer Yolanda Salvidar, originally broadcast in Spanish on Univision.Patoski's ""Selena"" is far more comprehensive its depiction of the strange goings-on of the entertainer's final months. Read it instead"
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,This book was complete trash. The author wasted the whole book misleading you and then does not even reveal what she claims to know. I don't believe there is a secret; she just used this book to exploit Selena's death. I can see why this book is being sold for 1 cent. You'd probably have to pay someone to take it off your hands. Don't waste your money on this book!!
2,SELENA,"My current female friend was good friend of Selena and her inner circle. Selena was a lesbian without doubt, but was not attracted to Saldivar. Selena did have numerous sexual affairs with attractive Hispanic and Anglo women (usually blondes) in the CC area. This is the secret not revealed in the book. Selena was sensual and loved women!"
2,This one is for Yolanda Saldivar fans,"I felt from the introduction that in some way this author was trying to make excuses for Yolanda Saldivar. (If you read the book you'll know what I am talking about.) I found the book to be a little too much about the author and her career rather than about Selena. You get the impression that she is trying to accuse the late Selena of hiding some horrible secret,of Selena's father being a rapist,& all the while Yolanda was just a victim in a complicated triangle. Yet,you never find out what that secret was supposed to be. The book is a long drawn out tale about Yolanda Saldivar and somehow only confirms just how crazy the woman really must have been. Unless you are just curious how stupid this book really is,I would not recommend purchasing it."
2,Sensational without substance,"I quickly got tired of the author congratulating herself on her coverage of the Selena story. She states that Saldivar told her ""the secret"" but she is bound to silence. So why write the book on nothing but innuendo? It is a common cry of the acused to say that they are guarding some secret that will set them free. I just don't buy it. Salidivar is just trying to stay in the limelight and to continue tormenting Selena's family and unfortunately this book continues her efforts."
1,Selena's Secret is no secret - just trash!,You will not learn any secrets from this piece of cr*p. The only secret you'll learn is that you wasted your money!
3,"Review of ""Selena's Secret""","Before purchasing this book, I took the time to read all the comments made from people who had already read the book. Despite the majority of the reviews being negative, I decided that I should review the book for myself. I found the author to have written the book in a very open style, giving the information she knew and leaving your own imagination to do the rest. This isn't a book which chronicles Selena's life and should not be bought if that's what you want to read about. I found the book quite interesting but my love of Selena's music is what matters to me and not aqusations made against her when she is not here to defend herself. Keep that in prospective when reading this book."
2,"After reading the book, the secret was still a mystery to me","After reading the book, the secret was still a mystery to me"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!,"This book offered absolutely nothing new regarding the deathof Tejano star, Selena. If you have followed news reports ofher life,death or the trial of Yolanda Saldivar....you haveall that this book offers. *I felt particularly used in having purchased this book because of the title, ""Selenas Secret."" Having read the book from front to cover; I found nothing new of interest. The author leads you on with bits and pieces of gossip, truths and half truths til in the end you do just what I did....drop i"
1,What a waste of money,"This book was such a waste of money. On the very last page she states ""I will not tell the secret until Yolanda wants me to."" This book was such a disapointment & a waste. It went right into the trash!"
1,Complete waste of time,"I bought this book in an attempt to understand ""what really happened to Selena, and why, in the hotel room of the Days Inn"" and came away with nothing more than I originally knew via news coverage at the time of her death! I found the title to be extremely misleading... Selena's secret? Well what ever the alleged secret was it remains still just that. Furthermore, the author couldn't seem to get enough of making reference to herself in some way or another. I thought this book would shed light on an unclear subject, but only left more questions with its insinuations. For those of you interested in reading about ""the secret"", don't bother as you probably know as much about the secret as anyone who's already read it. My advise to the author...next time you attempt to deliver information via book, media or otherwise, do just what you promise."
1,THE WORST BOOK EVER,"I hope Selena fans will not buy this book. It is not accurate and Arraras seems to be sympathetic with Yolanda Saldivar.It is my opinion that Arraras is just trying to cash in on Selena's death. Amazon had refused to puiblish my previous review because of my harshness toward Arraras, but I will say that if the shoe fits, wear it.She is a liar, among other things. I think you get the picture."
4,"Nice look to it, but hard to read the dial numbers","It's a great looking watch, but these type of black backgroud with the green numbers do not have a good way of letting read the dial numbers unless you are on a well lit room and looking at the dial at a certain angle. For that is the reason i gave this watch 4 stars, if I could them clearly in any light it would be a 5 star rating."
4,Thoughtful comparison of Nietzschean and Freudian psychologies,"The previous review is absolutely bewildering. There is no trace of Heidegger in this book. None. It's a much needed investigation of Nietzsche's emphasis upon psychology--something every secondary work notes but few explore. It's also a much needed comparison of Nietzsche and Freud's respective takes on human psychology, desire, and motivation (since there are strong resonances, and Freud was, undoubtedly influenced by N.). The author is a bit too quick to map Freudian concepts directly onto Nietzsche--without paying enough attention to the differences. And the interpretation of Nietzsche on will to power and sublimation seems questionable--far too influenced by Kaufmann's version of Nietzsche. But on the whole well worth investigating."
2,Hardly worth a yawn,"This book is as much about Freud and Heidegger as it is about Nietzsche. Golomb was right that there was a 'lacuna' in Nietzschean studies involving the study of Nietzsche's psychology, and his relationship to Freud. That would have been enough for a book. But Golomb also has the issue of Heidegger to introduce all over the place. As a result, this book becomes a Heideggerization of Freud and with him, Nietzsche.If you want to learn about Nietzsche, you don't want to read this. There are a couple of interesting enough chapters about the early development of Nietzsche's psychological thought. But beyond this, students proceed at their own peril."
5,Dickens has never sounded so good!,Really enjoyed hearing the story of Great Expectations brought to music. Chicorel uses original words from the novel and incorporates them into song. Noticed that Sally Ann Howes of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang fame appears on this CD. Would highly recommend this CD for any lover of theatre soundtracks or Dickens stories!
3,Am I the only one...,"Who was actually very frightened when I was little about the ending part of the movie? It actually gets quite dark, and the theme of the old evil witch dieing with her hand trapped under the glass dome stays with me 'till this day. If you have little ones that like me would be frightened of the subject of aging and death I can't really say this is the best movie for them..Everything up to that ending (and past it where the grandma does not go away) is very good however, the songs are better than sone others I grew up with.."
4,Are you serious?,"Who the hell do these people think they are selling this for $45??!! That's sickening, you should probably feel ashamed of yourselves."
5,Best read about the famine,"Beyond any doubt, this is the finest, most thoroughly researched yet readable book I've encountered about the Irish famine. Clear and concise, I found it to be comprehensive while not being exhaustive or ""preachy."""
5,Paddy's Lament - A Must Read,"This is an incredibly detailed and descriptive account of what actually happened during those years of the potato famine where the Irish suffered unbelievably inhumane treatment from Britain. There is too much to possibly comment on in this short space. It is an absolutely fabulous book, written very well, and is a great start for anyone digging into Irish history wanting to get right to the point of things. Simply put: Its a must read! I actually walked away feeling proud of my Irish Catholic Heritage for what they survived, but ashamed of the English Protestant in me."
1,Another distorting bigoted non-history,"Buy Cecil Woodham's ""The Great Hunger"" for a more balanced coverage. Don't forget that 1849 in Europe is not 2000 in the USA in terms of values or resources. As was pointed out by Akenson in ""The Irish Diaspora"", the UK response then was better than most UN responses to similar sufferring today. Ireland under the past two administrations is moving ahead, it is a pity that so-called Irish Americans don't follow the lead."
4,Its ok,"It was a good book, there is not really that much I can say about it, but it was good, but definitely could have found something better."
2,For Rimmer completists only,"Bob Rimmer covers a lot of his familiar territory here: non-monogamous love and sex-positive religion. The problem is that he has been there before, more effectively, in his other books.The religion thing has been done in Love Me Tomorrow. One of the main plot elements, being kidnapped in a boat, appeared many years ago in That Girl From Boston. And non-monogamy has a major role in just about everything Bob Rimmer has ever written.In addition, Dreamer of Dreams suffers from very careless proofreading. Misspelled words and incorrect punctuation abound. It's not bad enough to make it impossible to follow the story, but it is distracting.If you're new to Bob Rimmer's writing, this isn't the place to start. Pick up The Harrad Experiment, Proposition 31, or Thursday, My Love (all now in print again) instead."
1,Legendary Countercultural Twit Tries to Create New Religion!,"This is yet another book that deserves no stars at all. Robert Rimmer is a well-known twit and advocate of ""free love"" and other views and ""values"" best left in the sixties--now apparently he's decided to found a pseudo-religion. The result is the same as always--worship of the self and rampant promiscuity. Anyone who's read any of Rimmer's other books will know that he loves to ""justify"" a lack of especial love for anyone as being ""love for everyone."" While a few saintly people in various religious traditions are indeed capable of loving everyone and everything, well and truly, most people are not capable of this and should concentrate on loving their own as well as possible. Followers of Rimmer's idiotic pseudo-creed love only themselves, and treat others as simply objects for their own gratification."
2,"""Brand-new""? -- Not really . . .","The editors of National Lampoon do not understand the term ""brand-new."" At least 75% of the material in this book comes directly from the 1995 collection ""National Lampoon Presents True Facts: The Big Book."" This 2004 edition should be marketed as a four-color reissue with some additions, not as a completely new work. The new material is not very funny, the editorial comments are rife with typos, and at least three images are repeated twice _in the same book_! What a sloppy, frustrating follow-up to the hilarious 1995 collection.(...)"
5,"Thank you ""Good Morning America!""","I just saw this Bicycling Comedian guy on Good Morning America showing pictures of his funny road signs. I had to go out and buy the book! It doesn't disappoint.Tons of great color photos interspersed with funny newspaper clippings. Must be the best collection of funny road signs out there, very cleverly put together with a theme on each page.Everybody I've shown it to has laughed out loud, no matter what page they turn to. Reall funny stuff."
1,"MAY BE TRUE ""FACTS"" BUT","National Lampoon is well known for its humor -- much of which is raunchy. Going through this book, however, I will estimate that may one percent of the material actually made me smile. The other 99 percent was not really funny but was really, to be kind, stupid."
3,Amazing Amazon & Amazing Movie,I bought this as a christmas present for a friend. She had been trying to get it for a year. It came even sooner than promised. The upper righthand corner was a little dinged but not too bad.And again this movie never fails to make us cry. We dont even have to watch the whole thing. Just the ending and she and I are off.
5,excellent dvd,"This is an excellent story. It will make you cry, but well worth it. It gives you something to think about and makes you realize how important family is."
4,Great Christmas movie for the family!,"Even though it's not a new movie or one with some sort of special effects, it's still a good movie about cherishing what you have and appreciating the little things."
2,Poor packaging.,The package was broke and the DVD had slid all around inside the box. Better packaging would have been improved my rating.
2,The Love of a stranger,"My wife bought the song first and it touched her and when she saw the movie on TV I watched it with her and it was very moving. This little boys Mom was dying and didn't have much time to buy these shoes that he knew she would look good in when she went to meet God. I won't tell what happens, but it showed me that no matter what we think is important that there is always someone that is going through pain that is deeper then ours..It shows that when someone needs help and if we can help them in any way then we should, without knowing the reason why, then maybe when we get to heaven or even down our road, we will be blessed..It was only a pair of shoes on sale, but they were worth a million to a little boy..Anyone who has lost someone dear to them will understand this desperate need and love those red shoes brought.."
2,Too Sad & Maudlin For Me,"This is designed to be a tear jerker, so keep a roll of toilet paper or some Kleenex on hand if you dare watch this one.Although I liked the book and thought the film adaptation fairly decent, I could not stand the maudlin song that shares the title of the movie.The story is this: in 1985, a lawyer whose marriage is crumbling meets a little boy whose mother is dying. It turns out that Nathan, the boy is the lawyer's wife's pupil. Nathan wants to buy his dying mother shoes so she will look nice when she goes to see Jesus. If that ain't sad enough, the part where Nathan listens to her heart to see if she is still alive was just too hard for me. I had to leave the room on that part. It hammers you over the head with what is really important in life, but still, as other reviewers on the US boards have said, I, too prefer something more upbeat and cheery for the holidays. Although the movie was well acted, the execrable song cost it two stars. That was overkill."
5,Why isn't this on DVD yet?,"CBS/Paramount, what's with you, and why isn't this movie available on DVD? It premiered 2 Christmases ago already. They should be releasing TV shows and movies on DVD quicker than that now.Everyone should e-mail CBS and make sure they are at least going to air it again on TV this year.Anyway. It's an incredible movie."
5,Wonderful,I saw The Christmas Shoes on life time just had to have the movie for my collection. This movie has a very good story to tell.
2,Heart Warming,A typical story that embraces the loss of loved ones by defining the true meaning of family and giving.
5,Sentimental,This movie was very sentimental and tear provoking. Good acting and excellent message to those who need to prioritize their lives not just at Christmas but every day of their lives.
4,The Christmas Shoes,"The DVD of, ""The Christmas Shoes"", was heart warming and charming. We enjoyed it as a family. A wonderful holiday movie that was a hit with the whole family."
2,Not a good dvd,"I was really excited to see this movie on dvd. i have been looking for this for a long time.I received the Dvd in a timely manner and was really excited to watch the movie. When I started to watch the movie I was really disapointed to see that the DVD would just stop and the people would still be talking and the picture would freeze, it was like the DVD was stuck. I still kept it because I just love the movie and was afraid that if I sent it back an other one would not be available. I have ordered from amazon before and have been very satisfied with my purchases. However this one was a dissapointment.Thank youCarla Bertovich"
3,The Christmas Shoes,Obviously this was a made for TV movie. It is a relatively good story that grabs your heartstrings.
5,Great Christmas movie!,"My wife & I have seen ""Christmas Shoes"" a number of times over the last few years at Christmas time. Since we didn't catch it at all on T.V. this last Christmas season, it was time to add this great Christmas movie to our collection. It has become one of those ""must see at Christmas time"" movies for us!"
5,The Christmas Shoes,Great Christmas movie. lesson to be learned and great message. Can watch any time not just at Christmas. Great movie.
5,The Christmas Shoes,"A Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves the song and the movie, so I bought it so she can watch it whenever she wants."
1,The Christmas Shoes,This is the best Christmas movie out on the market. This movie has the spirit of Christmas all over it. It makes you think about your own life in a different way. You will watch it over and over again.
2,FAR TOO SAD FOR CHRISTMAS,"I'm quite surprised by how many five star reviews this movie gets. I don't know anyone that wants to watch a depressing movie about a young mother dying and leaving her child. Yes the actors were really good, but I've always been under the assumption that a christmas movie should make you feel good, not MISERABLE. If you have ever lost a person you love at the holidays or if someone you've lost loved Christmas this is definitely NOT the movie for you. Better take stock in Kleenex before you watch this depressing tear jerker."
2,Profanity in a Christian movie?,"I bought this movie on sale at the local Christian bookstore (Lifeway), thinking it would be a good Christmas movie for my family. I was shocked to hear two uses of the word ""D---it""! Why did the movie creators feel the need to throw in words like this, into a Christian movie of all places! Could they have not found another word? Nice movie, but unfortunately it's going back to the store, whether I get my money back or not."
1,Horrible,After two orders I never got the right item. I was sent a blueray and wanted a regular DVD - I had to return it twice and was told they would not send it a 3rd time even though the error was Amazon's. Proceeded to say they were probably out of stock but they should have told me that up front before putting me through the hassle of having to make two returns. Then it took forever to get my money back. It was a nightmare of a transaction. I went on line to Barnes & Noble and received my DVD in a few days
1,Sad movie!,"This movie is about ten year old Nathan Andrews, who find out his mother (Kimberly Williams) is dying. He wants to buy his mom new shoes for Christmas. A guy name Robert Layton, (Rob Lowe) who is a lawyer who does not spend to much time with his family. Robert meets Nathan at the store that bought the shoes for his mother. Roberts gives Nathan some extra money for the shoes. This movie is really sad. I would not recommend watching this movie. You will be reaching for the tissues every minute."
4,Christmas Time,An adorable Christmas movie that makes you stop and think that there is more to life than just making money. It is a great movie to watch with the family and just in time for the holidays.
3,Decent Christmas Movie,"Not my favorite Christmas movie. It is kind of slow and hard to get into, but it's still worth owning."
5,So much better than the book!,"I decided to watch the Christmas Trilogy (Shoes, Blessing, Hope) over the Christmas Holiday. I was amazed at how much wonderful the story was. The three movies were put together so perfectly, even more logical than that of the books. I felt so much pain for the little boy in the story. The cast was perfectly picked. The story was fantastic! Get this movie! It's not only for the Christmas season."
4,An Overview of Western Art History,"The scope of this series prevents it from lingering on detail, but as a starting point, Art of the Western World is an intriguing outline of the periods of western art. It provides points of reference to the progress and changes in the style of art in the Western World. This series presents the art in historical context of the movements discussed, and tries to inspire a viewer to discover and learn more about art not, feed us the information like pablum. The only negative comment I have on this series, is that unlike the Renaissance (both Northern and Southern) part of the series, the Post-Modern presentation is too vague and seems rushed. If you already have extensive art history training or are only interested in viewing one period of art in detail, a program which focuses on one movement or historical period would be more suitable."
4,This is a good series.,"We watched this video series during the last two terms in my Art History class. Yes, alot of people appeared to be asleep, but if they are anything like the students at my school, that wasn't the fault of the video. I thought they were very interesting and filled in alot of the gaps in my art history knowledge. I liked how they had mini-slide shows of works with some music playing in the background. It was especially nice in our lecture hall with the surround sound system."
3,A good solid effort,"I found these videos pretty good and not in the least boring. Michael Wood and the production team have done a solid effort in presenting such a vast topic in the time allowed. The areas covered are well presented, intelligently commented upon and comprehensive. Well worth seeing a few times."
2,Nothing New For This Collection,"I picked this up in a vinyl store in some small town. I am a sucker who will buy almost anything Stooges. This dosen't really offer anything new in the way of Stooges collections of ""lost material."" The same songs are here and they are about the same quality as any other collection you will find out there. A bonus, it's on vinyl and listening to a record is always a great treat. I don't really see any reason for anyone to track this down or buy it unless they want a collection of this material on vinyl. If this is your introduction to this material buy Original Punks or Penetration on CD first. They both offer the same tracks but with a cleaner sound. If you need more, than look for this."
5,A Must Read for ALL Black Athletes,"If you are a parent of a child playing sports, Here I Stand by Paul Robeson is a mandatory read. In this book he details the tumultuous journey that he was forced to undergo to play college football. At the same time, Robeson was an academic superstar who managed to excel on and off the field. If our sport stars want someone to emulate look no further than Paul Robeson and study his brief autobiographical story in Here I Stand.Also, if coaches have the players best interests at heart, please make certain that you provide each of them with a copy of Here I Stand, especially those in high school sports[...]. It can make the difference between them dying despondent and broke, or thriving throughout life on and off the playing field.Douglas E. Thomas"
5,Beyond the Bus Stop: 180 ways to Help YourChild Suceed in Sh,"This little book is a real gem for parents. I have used it as a gift for parents of children just entering school.

3,Not what I had expected,"The shipment for this product came earlier than the arrival shipment date, which is great. The only problem, I ordered 250mg. 60 capsules of L-Glutathione and received 100mg instead. The expiration date states 11/14 at least they are not expired."
2,A Trojan Horse for New Age Ideas,"Grieving from the recent loss of my mother, I picked up this book after reading the jacket and flipping through some of the pages. It seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. Imagine my surprise when part way into the book, the author began devoting half of the remaining pages to discussion of shamanistic rituals and her own cosmic field trips.This would be fine if the book was packaged as a New Age book about grieving. It was not, and this reader feels taken advantage of. The 2 stars are for the half of the book that gave what it promised: good practical advice about dealing with loss."
2,Not so practical guide to greif,"After the sudden lost of my mother, I felt strangely empty and confused. I had lost my father 2 years prior, and felt I dealt with his death in a very strong and mature way. After my mothers death I was feeling what I thought was an exaggrated sense of loss and bewilderment. I looked for books on the subject and found this book highly reccomended. I did not find what I was looking for.The author recounts her own experience with loss and encourages the reader to take their own ""out of body"" sharmanisit experiences to deal with grief. I found this not helpful and almost annoying. I did however stumble upon a different book with a simular title: Losing a Parent by Fiona Marshall. This book was excellent and helped so much more."
1,Wish I would have read the negative reviews,"I wish I would have read the negative reviews before I wasted my money on this hocus pocus book. I was looking for some ""lay man's"" guide on dealing with my father's death not going to spiritual land..."
5,A Powerful and Useful Account of Losing a Parent,"Telling her own experience of the death of her father, the author opens wide the experience for others. In a gentle, graceful, yet compelling manner, she allows us to enter a seldom visited domain; the interior space of one who is coping with the multiple and sometimes conflicting emotions of a parent's death. The reader will recognize his own shifting reactions in the author's description of her own. At the same time new possibilties for living may open up, as they did for me. For these reasons, this is a very outstanding book, one which I have given often to thoughtful friends coping with parental loss."
5,Wonderful,The cut-outs are fantastic and the facts are a great way to learn important information on each master painter. These are great for children riding in the back seat and to take along at a musuem.
3,Painters,"My Fandex on Painters arrived in good condition. Since I realize itwas a used edition, I found it to be perfectly suitable for my needs.Thank You"
4,Splendid run through on some previously unrecorded suites,"Its hard not to have the infectious enthusiasm of this music improve your day. These are all high spirited pieces from Telemann's large opus of suites (and fairly inventive too). As I sat listening to them I thought ""these have the same bouncing gait as a good piece of Handel"". The difference is Handel keeps the horse cantering along on the bridle path, and Telemann occasionally and unexpectedly sees a fox and steers the horse into the woods to chase it.The disc is long (almost 80 minutes) and while I don't love the price point (hence 4 stars instead of 5),the added bonus is that most of the suites haven't been recorded. So I'd give it 5 stars for the music and recording--highly recommended. But something less for the price. (After all, we are living in the world of naxos.)"
4,Super cute but fits a little off,"I purchased these shoes for my 16 month old daughter with fat little feet. We ordered wide width, but for some reason the beginning of the opening in the front is pressing down on her feet and actually is starting to leave a mark. It is wide on the sides but seems low if your little one has chubby feet all around. I got them for $17.99 so I really cannot complain too much, but had I paid retail, I would not be very happy. Needless to say because of this issue, I am going to have to refrain from ordering shoes online for her. They are definite attention getter shoes...."
3,Here Kitty Kitty,"Yet another ridiculous product aimed to take advantage of those foolish enough to own cats. Naturally, my cat-loving spouse Bessie insisted on getting this great ""two-for-one"" deal (something she has refused when suggested by yours truly in other arenas). Much like the equally idiotic Video Catnip videos, these films for cats are basically nothing more than some fidgety camera person filming birds that hopefully will keep your feline's attention while you're at work or out turning tricks. If you're lucky, the house will be in good shape when you return. I can't personally recommend these since my wife's newest terror cat (al-Bobo!) barely paid any attention. Of course he has a puny brain..."
5,"""fantastic collection lead by Chick Corea""","Hats off to Stretch Records (Concord Jazz) and Chick Corea in bringing together an outstanding array of musicians, bands and being inspired by one another, plus having fun. Some solo work surfaces by immensely talented artists that comprise Corea's acclaimed ensemble ORIGIN.This collection is a group dream of creativity, with enticing sampling from ORIGIN band members Avishai Cohen, Steven Wilson, Steve Davis, Tim Garland and Jeff Ballard - each clearly world-class solo jazz artists in their own right.Some stand outs: ""PSALM"" by Chick Corea & Origin, as well as the band's Grammy nominated composition ""WIGWAM"", both from the CD ""Change"", was only on a japanese release.If your a ""jazz fan"", this is a must have for your collection, don't pass this one up!Total Time: 65:23 on 11 Tracks...Stretch Records-SCD 9034...(2000)"
4,"Intelligent, realistic piece","The title may be ironic, as religions tend to question if not oppose what the several women and a few men do in this film: advise on (but not against) birth control and abortion. I saw this film in French without sub-titles, thus did not understand everything but did comprehend enough to appreciate it as a realistic drama showing encounters between counsellors (played by Nathalie Baye, Beatrice Dalle, etc.)and various women seeking advice and help re pregnancy or its potential. The film is documentary-like, which adds to its realism, as does the range of women seeking help and advice: young women of North African heritage whose parents regard ultra-marital sex as immoral; a young Spanish woman who is not quite ""all there"" seeking an abortion; an aging prostitute who finds herself pregnant due to three encounters with a non-client. A good film but not for those seeking intense drama and/or action."
4,Good Basic Cologne,"This is a good basic cologne. It is not that expensive, which is appreciated, and it lasts for a fairly long time, usually about 8 hours for me. It is somewhat minty, and if you are not used to that it can seem a bit unusual for a cologne. I use it after the gym to give me a clean fresh feeling. For most colognes, you slowly stop recognizing the cologne you are wearing due to your sense of smell getting accustomed to the scent, but I can still smell this after several hours and my wife has told me she smells it later in the day. Overall...very good general cologne."
5,A Cool Book,"When the kid goes to his locker and opens it, he is surprised to see a kid inside the locker that pushes him inside."
2,SUB PAR,"As you can tell from the unusual cover art, this 1956 session was never issued on LP. The problem was not Franks' flute playing but he is having obvious tonal and technical problems on tenor. Not his usual smooth self. Curtis Fuller and Hank Jones are also in the band.---- If you have Franks' NORTH SOUTH EAST--WESS session be advised that Frank Fosters'- NO COUNT session was recorded at the same session with the same personell Benny Powell, Henry Coker, Kenny Burrell etc."
1,Annoying!,"I'm all for low budget, indy movies providing a showcase for aspiring talent, but this movie didn't hold my attention for more than 15 minutes!"
2,meh,More of the same. I saw Countdown to Liquor Day awhile back and would certainly choose that TPB movie over this one. Then again if you are watching TPB then you may be willing (like me) to waste another hour or two on this mediocre comedy
4,Constant chuckle,What a collection of misfits. Just when you think formulaically there would be hostility and violence characters say....oh well ok. Alot of great lines in the script. A keeper.
4,"Trailer Park Boys,,, the Movie",I like this movie as much as all of the 6 seasons and the Christmas specials. None of my friends seem to like these DVD's at all! I can't help it if they are all dummards. If they could smarten up like me I think they would depreciate all of them.
3,Trailer Park Boys The Movie.,"I have not watched the show but I did see the movie and I thought it marginally funny but not bad, bizarre yet entertaining,it's not Kids in The Hall but it's not bad, it's stupid funny."
1,Wanted it to be better.,This wasn't done in true TPB fashion. Didn't even make it through the whole movie. The opening theme song wasn't even played!! Ugh.
2,No TPB Fan,"This isn't Shakespeare. I knew nothing of the TPB series before watching the movie and reading the reviews at this site. It seems that TPB fans like the movie because it fits in well with the series. I prefer movies that are realistic. I believe that most people who do dope, drink too much, party hearty at great length, and commit petty crimes for a living are mean-spirited, but the key characters in TPB seem to be basically kind-hearted. In other words, it's hard for me to laugh at the antics of this sort of person, because I know that, in the real world, these antics lead to a lot of pain. Of course, this movie features caricatures of people who engage in this kind of behavior, and there is humor in any human scenario. I gave the film two stars because the acting was solid. The players knew their roles and did yeoman work."
5,Trailer Park Boys: The Movie,We love these guys glad we were able to get the movie. transaction was fast and product was as stated
3,TPB Fan,"The movie was good, but not as good as the series or the second movie. But I love these guys and enjoy watching them whenever possible!"
2,wheres the funny?,"i dont know what the the hell they where doing for this one.ive seen the whole tv series(multiple time),tv specials countdown to liquor day and original shorts.which i love just about all of those.but this didnt really have a single funny moment.just bad all through out."
1,crap,Just plain garbage! Dont waste your time or money on this garbage. Product does not perform. Get a small stand that goes under your computer to alllow it to breathe better.
3,my review,battery life doesn't last long.it broke after about a monthso in my oppinion i wasted money on this product
1,There's a pattern with this player,"Just like with a number of the other reviewers, this MP3 player lasted for about six months and then the battery wouldn't hold a charge. Is this a problem with the MP3 player or just a number of people upset and therefore writing bad reviews? You decide; but no matter how cheaply I could buy this player, 'I won't get fooled again'."
2,IT WORKS GREAT for the first 3 months,"This was my first mp3 player and it was a great alternative to the iPod-it was small, convenient amount of storage, etc. But then it stopped working, so that kinda sucked."
1,Don't buy it!,"My Lyra worked great while it lasted. After about 4 months I started getting the ""File System corrupted"" error as noted in previous posts, and now it's unuseable. The user manual has a troubleshooting tip for when this happens, but their tip doesn't work. I called the ""RCA Lyra Line"" (866-449-7112) and they offered to exchange it, but I will have to pay 60 bucks for labor. I griped and moaned about having to pay to fix THEIR defective product, and was referred to the ""Customer Relations Dept"" (866-465-7157). I've called this number several times, but a recording tells me that my ""expected wait time is greater than 60 minutes"". Sheesh. I'll never buy anything from RCA again."
1,Junk. Absolute JUNK!,"This item was a complete let down. After 3 weeks of use and only half of the memory filled, It just stopped working. No, really. IT JUST STOPPED. I didn't use it one day and the next day the display said ""File System Corrupt"". When I went on the website to correct the problem, the manual says that there is a glitch that does not allow you to fix it. Luckily, I brought it from Wal-Wart and was able to get my money back."
2,"Not bad, but not the best","I have had mine for about 3 months now. It plays music well and I keep using it because of that. However, the battery doesn't hold up well (about 5 hours while running basic speakers) and building a customized playlist is nearly impossible. I found that Windows Media Player is much simplier for downloading music to it than the Musicmatch software they want you to use.However, it does work and 4 gigs is nice. It has a nice size to it but the case that came with it is useless if you don't wear a belt and you can't find cases for it. I also wish it had features like picking up in a song where you left off like other MP3 out there.It won't be my next MP3 player."
3,Confusing and pedestrian,"I felt that it just didn't progress into any sort of storyline. A book where mysterious phone calls, women and obsessions with wells abound and nothing much happens. I know that a lot of people rave about this book but I just didn't get it!"
5,Uncomprehensibly foggy,"This book is a fictional GEM. Just dare to take on Haruki's metaphysical world, a world in which everything in life comes together at one single point, fusing the real with the imaginary - if every detail is researched over and understood your head will implode with information. Haruki brings forth a story that seems to be very logical but driven by extraordinary events that somehow, somewhere, make sense - the novel turns into a cook book, a mathematical equation for what takes place to Okada - every piece and detail could be explained from something personal in the main characters life - a very simple and ordinary life so he thinks. What is happening to him is just another statistic. I have read nearly all of Haruki Murakamis literature and consider this along with Kafka on the Shore his best novels."
2,"Long, disappointing read","I had heard great things about this book. However, it was pure drudgery to read it. I only kept reading it because I expected it to get better as I read further, and I needed to finish it for my book club. After 600 pages I was disappointed and confused. I probably won't be reading another Murakami book, based on this one."
3,House of Mirrors,"Reading the Wind-up Bird Chronicle was like walking thru a very large art gallery (slash) house of mirrors. In this gallery, each work of art is loosely connected to the one next to it (sometimes), and the gallery itself is like a big fun house with moving floors and distortion mirrors where a whole lot of freaky, weird stuff is happening. I thought if I could make it thru the 600+ pages, the meanings of these mysterious elements would be revealed in the end. I finished all 600 pages, and in the end there was no explanation for any of the weirdness, no explanation for the odd characters, weird events, strange objects...However, I gave it 3 stars because most of the works of art (like Lt. Mamiya's story) are great stand-alone pieces , interesting in their own rights. I also enjoyed the variety of literary forms. Although the protagaonist is very pop culturesque, I also appreciate Murakami's high-context style of writing. If there were a half-star system, I'd have given it 3.5 stars."
2,Sitting in my chair,"Sitting in my chair, I saw a sunny spot on the carpet. I resisted moving for several minutes, and the spot shifted its position slightly.That's when the slender woman entered my line of vision. She was wearing a yellow plastic raincoat and pink Chuck Taylor high-top sneakers that sounded like Philly Joe Jones doing some inspired brushwork during ""Night in Tunisia"" (the Verve version, not the Bluenote).She asked me if I liked her with our without breasts, and I said simply ""Yes"", remembering that I needed to sautee the chicken breasts for dinner, add a little soy sauce, and vaccuum the carpet.When I looked up again the woman was gone. I looked back at the sunny spot, but it had started raining outside, and sounded like the rain drumming on the pith helmets of the Manchurian expedition stranded in Hangchow in the bleak autumn of 1939, when many of the soldiers were forced to unwrap their leggings and wring them out for drinking water and nourishment.(Continue for 600 pages.)"
2,Loved first third but then unsatisfying,"I just loved everything about the first third of this hefty novel. It became disappointing when it dawned on me, that the author wouldn't be able to resolve all the clues and mysteries he'd laid out. The main protagonist started acting increasingly irrational too. I am also didn't particularly like the exceedingly graphic descriptions of war atrocities. It went on for too long too. I love serious fiction and I realize my opinion runs counter to the main stream, but that's the way I feel."
2,If you like to find meaning in meaninglessness...,"This is the first book in a long time that I can say that I did not like despite it being very well written. Maybe I just don't like the genre of surrealistic existentialism. It's difficult for me to put my finger on what I disliked. I didn't like the scenes of intense and graphic violence. I didn't like not caring about the protagonist (who also seemed not to care about anything himself). There are other things I didn't like as well, but, ultimately, it wasn't any one thing that turned me off. I'm sure that some might say that those things that I disliked were exactly the point (the meaninglessness is the meaning!). Frankly, I just found it tedious.The writing (and/or translation) was good, though, so maybe I'll give his memoir about running a try..."
4,An interesting though not easily understandable read,"This book will keep you interested and entertained from start to finish. It is a sort of fantasy, mystery, love story. The plot is actually three plots. The protaganist is searching for his missing wife, is developing a friendship with a teenage girl all the while Murakami is retelling a veteran's horrific war story.The book is hard to interpret, my belief is that it has many meanings but the main point I took away from it is the power of imagination and meditation in acheiving our goals and desires. It is beautiflly written and I would give it a higher rating were it not a little slow in spots. Still, an excellent, mesmerizing read"
4,Eastern Twin-Peaks,"If you enjoyed ""Twin-Peaks"" you will love this book. It takes you off on directions never thought of. It starts in normality - a guy making spagetti and starts to twist and turn into alternative realities. Its themes are present, past and the supernatural world that lies just beneath the surface. It shows how all these worlds are linked. If you are into sincrinicity then you will understand this book entirely. I really enjoyed this book and will definately buy other books by this author."
5,.,"Engrossing, complex, and thoroughly rewarding book which I finished, as it happens, about an hour ago. Things don't interweave together as clearly, smoothly, or admirably as they do in Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World (the only other Murakami novel I've read at this point), and this was something of a disappointment to me, but it makes up for it in the sheer massiveness of its narrative, juxtapositions, mind-boggling parallels, etc. It's like a giant, fascinating, literary puzzle, and although the picture the puzzle ultimately forms isn't especially clear, that doesn't mean it wasn't a lot of fun to spend time with. Thought-provoking, epic, and though certainly not flawless, very much worthwhile."
5,Can't wait to read it again,"Like I said, it's so great I can't wait to let some of it fade then pick it up again in a few years. Some of the gory bits are hard to handle, but it's well worth it. It's longish, but I wished it would keep going at the end. He really lets you slip into the life of the main character, as surreal as it may be."
4,Murakami Grows Up,"This is a highly accomplished book by Murakami, a kind of grown up version of Wild Sheep Chase. The off the wall humour has gone but in its place we have some fine character development and an excellent edge on contemporary sex and politics. Its still vintage Murakami though with larger than life villains, girls with sexy ears, some nice culinary touches and the inevitable view of the shopwindows in downtown Tokyo. Woven into the story is a revealing cameo of the Japanese occupation of Manchukuo and the aftermath of the defeat.Jay Rubin's translation is pretty good although one or two bizarre grammar errors seem to have escaped someone's eye and I noted too some problems with the adjective derived from the word Malta. However, for all that, it is quite a tour de force almost ranking with Hard Boiled Wonderland."
2,100 Words or Less,"I wanted to continue, but the narrative voice is so damn irritating that I can't. The main character is so passive and pliable. Moping around his house? Check. Seemingly giving up on life? Check. Accepting demands from others because who really cares? Check.By the time the plot picks up, it's too late. I don't care what he does, mainly because I'm not sure he'll do anything. At least not until it's too weird or too many pages have passed by.I don't need every page action-packed, but at least give the characters some momentum. That'd be nice."
4,adult fairy tale,"I liked this book because its covers several stories, some obviously intertwined, some not. Particularly fascinating are the sections dealing with the War in Manuchuria. They are based on facts about the Japanese incursion into Manchuria during the 1930's, but some of the details are so bizarre that they blend exquisitely with the surreal atmosphere that permeates the entire book."
4,Notes from the bottom of the well,Another great read from Murakami. As usual not totally sure what happened but certainly enjoyed the ride. Next Murakami please.
5,one of the best books out there,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I wish I could put my finger on what exactly it is, but I know I am not the same person after reading this book."
4,bounces between the hopelessly mundane and the searlingly violent,"It's not hard to find novels these days that deal with personal ennui, national guilt, dreams, the supernatural etc. What struck me about this is the awesomely bizarre way in which all of these forces reinforce and interact with each other here. On the one hand you get moments of an almost suffocatingly sensible domestic life, and on the other hand, bits of hallucinatory violence and surreal-ish occurrences, though the juxtaposition between them kind of breaks down by the end (which might or might not be the point). I'm a bit embarrassed to admit it, but I've never read any Japanese fiction before, and while that did not prevent me from immensely enjoying it, I can't help but think that I really don't have the proper background to fully appreciate it. The end of the first section though, damn, has to be one of the most harrowing, emotionally draining things I've ever come across in fiction"
5,"Murakami fascinates me, this book is a mind trip","With this book, the first Murakami I read, I was set spinning on an incredible journey of awe. I remember having this same feeling when I first read The Magus. I was completely swept up in this book and thought about it long after finishing it. Accidently left it in a spa lockerroom when I only had 50 pages left, realized I had left it far behind and headed immediately to a book store to get another copy retrieving the first copy weeks later. I now own two. I need two so I can continuously lend them out to my friends! Since reading The wind up bird chronicle I have read at least 7 more of his books- I adored many of them but not to the same degree of the first. It is absolutely wonderfully great!"
4,Fun trip!,"I guess I like his books so much because there is always hope I will understand one of them. Even if I don't, I find pleasure in his writing and the fun of TRYING to make sense of them.I don't know why this book by Murakami was so difficult for me to get through. It is no more obtuse than the others of his I have read, but I could only take this in small doses. I rarely re-read a book but I may give this one another try in a few years. As I said, there's always hope."
5,"Creative, emotional and unlike anthying else","Murakami's novel brings ancient struggle between evil and good into a new dimension. The author interplays and intertwines dream and reality, past and present, female and male characters to create complex, disturbing and beautiful experience. I particularly enjoyed the diversity of the threads within this book and the parallels betweens the characters and events. Murakami's writing style is unlike any other that I have encountered. Using very simple words, sentence structures and situations Murakami puzzles and intrigues the reader through the entire book. This is one of those books that you just have to finish."
4,Don't start here.,"If you're going to begin reading Murakami books, don't start with this one. After reading ""South of the Border, West of the sun,"" (Which I thought was wonderful), I found this book to be a lot more laborious to get through. Around the 400 page mark, you don't really know where anything is going. You have to have a lot of faith in an author to keep reading after you begin to doubt he's going to take you somewhere special in the next 200 pages. Definitely try Murakami, but don't start here."
3,Draining to read at times,"This book has no aim whatsoever. Some days I really liked it, and other days I hated it. Where is this book going? What questions have been answered in it? I still don't know, but I would not reread the book to figure it out. I would recommend this book to people who have nothing better to read, or to those who don't really care if the novel they're reading has a solid purpose or message."
3,Lost Season 6,"the connections made throughout the book are truly well thought out. A plethora of symbology and interconnectedness is found with each character, each event and each location. However; as I approached the end of the book, I had only what i can describe as a ""LOST SEASON 6"" feeling. With each turn of the page i came to the realization that nothing would truly be resolved, none of the mysteries would be answered; everything would ultimately be left hanging. (I also had the same experience with ""Kafka on the Shore"") Murakami can set up questions, mysteries and the like as few authors can, there are just no answers by the time you close the back cover."
2,horrific translation,"I read the review stating that this English translation was far from ideal, and I can confirm that something is awry after struggling through a choppily arranged novel chock full of errors (grammatical, punctuation, arrangement, simple spacing). I have no idea how these novels get digitized, and certainly haven't read the book in any other format, but I'm very disappointed to finish a critically acclaimed novel (by one of my favorite authors) and wonder what was 'lost in translation'.I would in no way recommend this download for English readers; find a different translation. I hate to give Murakami any kind of poor review, but take this as a reflection of the product as a whole. I've never had troubles with his other novels in 'physical print' before, maybe Kindle is still working out some kinks. I, for one, would appreciate a refund."
5,An Excellent Accidental Read,"I picked this up by mistake but loved it. The sense of time, synapse and memory was wonderfully engaging. Don't want to give anything away, but be prepared to see things in a different light."
5,A glimpse into the Japanese psyche?,"Murakami has an appeal to readers in nations possessing political histories which at times are at odds with Japan and even amongst themselves, including Korea, China, and Taiwan. Murakami boldly tackles history in a way that few Japanese authors do. Murakami promised Harper`s Bazaar that he would look into history to deal with his country`s uncomfortable wartime past. In The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (Nejimakidori kuronikuru), he seems to take on responsibility for Japan`s role in China`s colonization by presenting characters that were involved in military incursions into Manchuria and Mongolia."
2,B-,"Interminably long, bloated, and meandering, but there are moments of beautiful writing and some worthy chapters that can stand alone (e.g., Lt. Mamiya's stories). Overall, however, the characters, themes, plot just don't come together for me; none of these feel fully realized, urgent, or deserving of the demands it makes on the reader. I feel that the book could have been improved by some judicious editing.His writing style IS ""hypnotic"", as they say. Toru's voice really took me to that grey zone between reality and the otherworld that he experiences. Sometimes when I put the book down, I felt like I had just emerged from the dark, mysterious world of ""Room 208"", and I needed to take a moment to remind myself that I was in the real world.Murakami is clearly a talented writer, but ultimately his ambitions got the best of him with this one and he doesn't deliver a ""masterpiece""; he delivers a promising but flawed book."
5,This why God gave us eyes....,"This is the book you should read. That everyone should read. This book...oh...this book...wow...this book. Really. You should not hesitate for a moment and get up and go buy it. Rarely has an epic tale been so enjoyable and compulsively readable; the POV jump cuts and swings around, jumping time and place and narration.When I bought this, I had no idea who Haruki Murakami was and why I should care. Immediately afterwards, I bought every book of his and borrowed the ones not yet available in this country.He is one of the finest writers working today and if you don't support him, then you are against him, and if you are against him, you are against everything good literature and good art stands for."
2,Waiting for Murakami,"Murakami writes well and I finished the tale. As I closed it, I wondered why I had persisted, spending precious time on nothing of substance. I hope that at some point he touches at least one foot on earth and writes about something."
5,Far and away the most pround and gripping novel I read this,"This novel reminds me of a powerful hybrid between the great 19th century modernist novels and the paranoid genius tradition of Pynchon and DeLillo. The 600+ pages fly by as the the reader gets wrapped up in an ever tighter and more peculiar web of history, conscience, search, loneliness and love for the lost as well as pity for the many victims of cultural malaise.Set in Japan it easily transcends geography and nationality and becomes a sort of diary of an everyman who is both, entirely common and extremely at odds with his surroundings who become more inexplicable the deeper he looks for answers to seemingly mundane questions. Definitely in the grand tradition of magical realism but not as overtly verbose! Hardly a sentence seems profound enough to quote but read in its entirety it is moving and devastating and kept me turning the pages way past a reasonable bedtime."
2,Meandering mess,"This book was recommended to me after I had made a recommendation for another Japanese author, Natsuo Kirino. Windup Bird begins with promise but after 400 or so pages you are still trying to figure out what the blazes is going on. After 500 pages, I'm too stubborn to stop; but, the last ten pages were absolute torture. There are many components and characters in the book, while I'm sure the author thought would be interesting, were plain silly making little sense. Natsuo Kirino's ""Out"" would be time better spent."
3,Arbitrary and prosaic,"While I won't begin to blame Murakami for the prosaic nature of this book, given that it is a translation, I don't believe a better translation would have helped much with the story. Perhaps I didn't read this in an optimal circumstance, or perhaps I simply don't appreciate Murakami's style (many friends of mine who I respect love this novel), but I found it to be a mediocre read. The plot wasn't particularly interesting or inventive. I felt as though odd plot devices were inserted simply to throw the reader off (hence the arbitrary nature). Perhaps more tellingly, after reading it a few months ago, the only fragments of the story which I remember vividly are the incredibly violent bits."
2,TV on Paper,"Reading this book is like watching television. Not necessarily bad television but still television. I don't understand why Murakami doesn't just team up with David Lynch and make a bunch of movies...his talents are not as a writer. That said, this is probably good beach reading. It's not best-seller bad but it's not exactly literature either."
5,Just as promised-quick shipping,this was exactly what i wanted. it was noted as used but it is barely used. it's in great condition. I am very pleased. Shipping was faster than I expected as well.Thanks!!!!!
5,metaphysical modern fiction,"Maurakami is a genius. One of the most prolific writers today, combining the text within text of music, art, and pop culture."
2,I don't get it,"I can't figure out why this book is so popular.It was a major disappointment to me. It's not that I don't like weird stuff. Or maybe I'm just too conservative: I loved Tanizaki& Abe Kobo, especially his Woman in the Dunes & his Box Man. But this is just a confused mishmash where nothing really ever seemed to happen."
2,I gave up on it.,"I listened to the audiobook and gave up after file 8 of 21.Guy leads very boring jobless life and occasionally people tell him somewhat interesting stories with too high an emphasis on psychic stuff (at the moment he is in between forgetting his dear cat is missing, and trying to figure out if his wife left him).Very slow moving story that at times really doesn't make sense (lacks coherence?), and why do people randomly spill their deepest secrets to this somewhat creepy guy?! I just don't care to read more. I'm really not in the mood for this and doubt I ever will be. I quit."
2,what the heck was that about?,"bizarre yet captivating at the same time. little long winded as well.hmmm i lost my cat. some strange person with a funny hat says there is something wrong with my water.let me dwell on that by going down into a dark dry well so i can meditate...wait.. what..?interesting read nonetheless but was a little bit exhausting in the end to finish.I have to warn you, once you pick it up you have to finish it- the strangeness just made me so curious i kept wondering how it would end. Not that the end gives you any respite from the weirdness nor any satisfaction in the story..."
4,"starts fantastic, veers a bit off track","I just got around to reading this book after sitting on my shelf for several years (the book, not me). I thought that it started well with some well developed characters and a really enchanting way of writing, and the author's ability to capture the mood and feel of contemporary Japan is already well known. But things seemed to veer a bit off track as the novel unfolded. I'd still recommend it though part of me wonders what could have been."
2,Disappointment,"Murakami has got to be one of my fave authors, but this book was a great disappointment for me. There were some interesting stories included in the work, but put together they lacked cohesion. I kept waiting for things to be tied up in the end, but that never seemed to happen.There are many other works by Murakami from which to chose. I suggest you skip this one and go for another."
1,What am I missing,"I am sorry but this book is one of the worst I have read. What am I missing? Everyone seems to love it except for myself. I had the book sitting on my shelf for a couple of years, wondering why I bought it. Then I looked at reviews and thought ""This must be good."" So I started to read, kept reading, and still hated it. Please, someone tell me what I am missing?"
1,"Haunted houses, pre-teen prophets and psychic prostitutes..","Let's try real hard to be weird and mysterious as possible. Apparently Mr. Murakami didn't try hard enough. An abandoned house(possibly haunted), a wise-old teenager, a malevolent brother in-law, dreams crossing into reality, things disappearing into thin air? it's all been used, re-used, recycled and borrowed. No wonder the book is so long. Mr. Murakami attempted to string together every para-normal theme and ended up with more of a scary campfire story than a chronicle. I was unable to finish this book. The pain Creta Kano whined about to Toru Okada for what felt like three days was similar to the pain I felt reading 75% of this book. Did the Boogeyman appear in the ensuing chapters? The story sure felt like was heading in that direction. If you're looking for ""flakes"" try the psychic hotline instead. It's less time consuming and more entertaining."
2,An Ordeal to Finish,"I am a diehard Murakami fan. I have read a good chunk of his novels and have gotten accustomed to his distinct style. I could deal with Kafka on the Shore's quirkiness, so I tried The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle.One of Murakami's gifts is to explore the mind of a character and analyze their personalities and relationships with others. The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle only offers an unlikeable main character and a whirlwind of characters and places that drift in and out of the narrative. It has the usual cats, psychic phenomena, and mysterious women, typical of Murakami. I felt reading this novel as an ordeal and I admit to skimming over the historical chapters dealing with Manchuria. Murakami should stick to a relatively straight-through plots and skip dream sequences. I want to like this book but I can't. Don't use this book as an introduction to Haruki Murakami, try Norwegian Wood instead."
4,Literally couldn't put it down,"I agree with a previous reviewer that the end of this 600 page novel isn't satisfying, in the traditional sense. Most American fiction has a predictable happy ending for the hero. This one doesn't.But that may just be part of the different feel one gets when reading foreign authors. I've read Marquez and other South Americans, but this is my first foray into Japanese writers. The imagery, the revealing life of the mind, and the unpredictable plot, kept me glued to this book from early morning until 1AM."
2,this was a great book?,"I bought this based on all the reviews here and was sorely disappointed. My assessment of the book is this: when the author didn't know what to do next, he introduced some character out of nowhere, no connection, no realistic explanation, no reason at all other than to un-stall the storyline. When he needed something else to happen, he made some other character mysteriously disappear under seemingly nonsensical circumstances.....rinse, repeat, ad nauseam.I don't know...I love to read, but I didn't like the storyline, the characters, or the way the author wrote. Great books I'd recommend are Blindness by Jose Saramago, Bel Canto by Ann Patchett and Life of Pi by Yann Martel."
4,Good,"The book was in great condition however when it was mailed to me, using standard shipping, it took a few weeks. I wish the response time was better!"
3,The Wind-Up Bird,"Wow! This took quite a while to get through, and in small doses. I read it because my book club picked it. I really didn't get into it until the last half, and I kept reading because I thought sooner or later it would make sense. I think the book was probably fine - I'm just not crazy about this sytle, topic, or writer."
4,A little overwrought...,"This is not Murakami's best work. I felt like it was a little too overworked. The ending seems too improbable (relatively) - it just didn't seem consistent with the rest of the story - too unexplained. The plot is too conveluted. (sp?)Still, definitely worth reading."
2,Dull as dirt,"I recently read the same author's 1Q84 and thoroughly enjoyed that strange land. But this one, I just couldn't get into at all. It started off dull...and stayed that way. I also noticed certain themes recurring that, frankly, I didn't care much about. Bored househusband getting ominous sexy calls from strange women, then hanging out with teenage girls, and endless descriptions of him making his lunch, picking up drycleaning and looking for a cat. Yes, there was a sense of foreboding gathering over the proceedings, but I just didn't have the patience to see what it turned into. I dropped out of this book about 40 percent through. If it suddenly gets awesome halfway in, I hope someone will tell me."
3,Eh.,"It started out interesting -- a normal guy with a normal life that starts experiencing a couple of weird things. Then the book comes full circle and by the end, it's strange if anything normal happens. Basically, I was bored and annoyed by the end. I was disappointed by the lack of ""wrap-up"" and while, halfway through the book, I was recommending it to everyone I met, by the time it was over I decided not to read another of his books. So... eh."
1,Frustrating and violent,"In this book, the author must have been filling time and overcoming writer's block by describing in intricate detail boring things like making lunch and losing ties. I struggled to remain interested only to find myself horrified by an extended rape scene that just went on and on. People natter on about the dream-like quality of the writing. I would describe it more as a dull and monotonous snooze-fest, interspersed by nightmares."
2,What Went Wrong?,"I've been a fan of Melting Euphoria since their first album, and waited with great anticipation for the release of this, their fourth. Sadly, I was more than disappointed. The beautiful female vocalizations present on their first two albums have still not returned, and gone also is a lot of the electronic bubbles and synth washes that gave ME such a wonderfully spacy sound. What we are left with is a lacklustre collection of aimless jams, with lots of guitar, but devoid of any really interesting guitar hooks. On ""Field of Reeds"", ME heads out for the first time on ablum, on an extended (12+ minutes) piece, which unfortunately showcases the weaknesses, rather than the strengths of the band. It sounds as if they are running out of musical ideas on this one. Still, I give it a couple of stars because it makes pleasant enough background noise, just fails to grab and hold on like their previous efforts."
2,Took me Over!,"Some people have been somewhat unfair towards this album. Screw 'em! This is GREAT, a wonderful sonic assault on the consciousness. There is some tendancy towards repetitiveness, but there are true gems like ""Night on the Rappahannock:, an accoustical departure from the undulating psychsufr that pervades the rest of the album. ""Tabs of Blue and Silver Sunshine"" is unbelievably dynamic and driving. In a kinder world, this very talented band would receive more attention from the mainstream(although it would probably end up being used to sell cars, a la Moby). Simply put, some of the best music out there.P.S. I'm a little older than 12. DUHHH"
2,Simmons Blazer 3 Scope,"I was excited to see this on sale! That a hundred and something scope was $39 and something! WoW! Then I had to pay Shipping( They have no shipping agreement w/ Amazon, so my upgraded membership meant nothing) and then I waited...., and waited..., UPS GROUND??? C'mon guys USPS flat rate box and I have it in 2 days WORKS. And Then, I finally get it. The OPTICS TOTALLY DRAW A VACUUM!! CAN YOU SAY FUZZY?? I'm not happy, to say the least."
2,Master Series cross hairs turn inside tube,A beautiful little scope I mounted on my Horton Crossbow. After one deer season the cross hairs began to turn. If you tap the scope with your knuckle you can watch it slowly move a few degrees at a time. With the price of arrows a new scope is in order. I will spend a few dollars more this time. Chinese Junk!!
4,Pretty good CD,"My sons found this band by accident while shopping at a record store. They liked it so I thought I'd try them. Not bad. I now own both of their CD's and they're pretty good. I lean toward the heavier stuff, and this is not that, but if you like ""proggy,"" try this band."
4,Darkwater,"This was purchased cause this band was recently added to myspace,I reviewed a few cuts from this cd and was impressed. I would say that this music is in the progressive metal genre,kind of like Dream Theater.They have their own beat and style which is well impressive.Good debut release,they're going somewhere by their musical skills that they have.Buy it!"
1,**restoration**restoration- let us remember,"just heard bro.warnke in city i live in, lou.ky. on christian tv station- just wrote new new book, 'friendly fire.'now, an article came out about his ministry while back, an expose', he repented, and submitted to 5 pastors.currently, he is being used in ministry.so, let us remember God is a God of restoration and new beginnings."
4,This book is excellent.,"This book is really good for those interested in Sweet Valley. However, you must remember that once you have read this particular book the series must be continued."
2,Funny... but not good,i thought it was a pretty funny movie. its just the game going around killing people. if your getting this expecting a good movie well you'll be disappointed. its not nearly as bad as survival of the illest (the worst movie of all time)
1,Don't waste your time.,"Terrible ""sequel"", that has absolutely nothing to do with the original.The original had some plot and things going on, but with this one, after 20 minutes, I had to turn it off.To call this Belly 2, does the first movie no justice at all.I'd rate it ZERO starts if I could. Do no buy, rent or even bootleg."
1,HORRIBLE,This movie is the most horrble movie I have ever seen. CHEESY and it looks like some low bugdet wanna be gangsta movie.
2,NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL BELLY,"I RENTED THIS DVD FROM REDBOX FOR $1.00. AND THATS ABOUT AS MUSH AS ITS WORTH. HOVING NO STORY-LINE CONNECTION TO THE DIRECTOR HYPE WILLIAMS 1998 FILM. BELLY 2 FOLLOWS G(PLAYED BY THE GAME), AN EX CON LOOKING TO RECLAIM THE STREETS OF LA'S HOOD. THE ACTING IS OKAY, AND THE DIALOGE IS LOADED WITH CLICHES'S. IF UOUR LOOKING FOR A MOVIE SIMILAR TO THE ORIGINAL BELLY , THIS AINT IT. BUT IF YPOUR A FAN OF THE GAME U MAY LIKE IT."
1,Save yoursele,"This movie is one of the worst movies ever made, the screenwriter got paid for piecing together a horrible script & throwing Belly 2 on as the title. Game is a horrible actor & should never be seen as a lead in a movie. Please save yourself & your time from watching a horrible movie."
3,A reissue Dr. Frankenstein would love,Hard to recommend purchasing this material in this misguided configuration as long as other options exist. The Hibbler/Kirk album is currently available as an import for only a few dollars more and includes one track dropped here due to time restrictions. The Coleman album (featuring Scott LaFaro on bass) is even more easily obtained and features a bonus track also not heard here.
2,"Up Hibbler, Down Ornette","Although not as strong as in his earlier work, Hibbler is still fun to listen to in this 1972 album. Kirk accompanies him admirably.Ornette is another story! This is atonal noise. OK, I'm sure there are some (a minority to be sure) that consider ""Ornette"" a great album, but in the last analysis, the music is unaccessible and pretentious. This is the kind of music that gives jazz a bad name."
3,it shoulda been called water under the bridge,this album caught my eye in the record shop. i loved millencolin. but this album made me loose respect. i pick this one up and listened to the first 3 songs and i was hooked. but i forgot to listen to the other songs. but i think millencolin is going to outdue themselves in albums to come. i said my piece im out
5,This cd is in my memory banks forever,"Me and my best friends listened to this cd, day in and day out, for what were some of the best years of my life, high school. Its a great album and if you like millencolin this is my personal favorite along with life on a plate and for monkeys, def check this cd out if you haven't already, even if you've never listened to millencolin, its a sweet cd and i know you'll enjoy it. I seriously can't give it enough praise! Turner rd forever baby! woohooo!"
4,"Colse but, No Cigar.","This is a good punk album. Millencolin is a great punk group. I hear people say all the time that Millencolin should be as big as NOFX and No Use For A Name. But its not true. They could be as big and as good, but thier album simply isn't a 5 star preformance. They are a great band but thier album seems all the same, and most songs have no real subject.PS-The song No Cigar is awsome!"
4,Millencolin is amazing; buy this cd,"I was first introduced to Millencolin by Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 with their excellent track ""No Cigar""; however after that I was really interested in them. Pennybridge Pioneers is a great representation of this English-is-our-second-language-but-we-still-can-rock band. Great tracks include ""No Cigar"", ""Devil Me"", ""Pepper"", and ""Penguins and Polar Bears"". The lyrics are catchy, the tunes are great to listen to, and they just plain rock. If you like punk, buy it now."
1,not millencolin,"this CD isn't that good. I loved their ska stuff off of Same Old Tunes(definitely buy that one).After hearing the crap off of For Monkeys, I wanted to give Millencolin another shot, but they dissappoint again with more crap. On this CD, they sound like they're trying to become more rock with a hint of punk. Get it if you're into that I guess. ""No Cigar"" is so-so, but the rest is just awful,with the singer's voice going really high and sounds like crap once again.Definitely the worst CD by Millencolin."
2,They have done way better,"It's very....blinkish. It's just not that good of a CD. There's no intensity at all, and that's a key element of punk music. I love Millencolin, don't get me wrong. But, it's what is in there other CDs that I love. I just hope this was an experimental CD and they aren't following the path of the Vandals who are going down hill. The Vandals last two CDs were so slow and not anything like ""Live Fast Diarrhea"" or ""the quickening"". These new sounds of punk bands are soundling like Blink 182, and Blink is just another boy band. And Blink, I can't stand at all"
5,A Pop Punk Materpiece,"No dissapointment here from this Sweedish foursome. Catchy lyrics, fast, shredding guitar solos, and polished off with one of the most unique voices in punk rock(compliments of lead singer and bassist Nikola Sarcevic). This is truely a great album. Some favorites inlclude: No Cigar, Fox, Penguins and Polarbears, and Highway Donkey. The band doesn't waste your time with any tracks, with almost all songs clocking in around the 2 and half minute mark. I didn't really dig the last song, ""The Ballad"" which is an acoustic dud in my opinion. But I still gave it a 5! Buy this album!"
3,"The best by Millencolin, but not THAT good.","This is the best album Millencolin have done, they've stopped playing pretty rubbish ska and have generally written a good album, but if you play guitar, you'll realise most of the riffs are the same! Okay, but by no means amazing."
3,I don't want to be negative...,"But this cd is just too ""mature""...i mean it seems like they are forcing their brand of ""mature"" music...i try not to be critical of bands that chang their style since change is unavoidable...however their new style is way too slow and the rad backround vocals are lacking...Same Old Toons and Life on a Plate are much better in my oppinion...i still listen to both years after i bought them, yet i haven't listened to Pennybridge since the week i bought it"
4,Not their best but still great,"Yea I'll agree that this isn't their best, but it's still a great cd. It is a bit slower, but entertaining. And ""Penguins and Polarbears"" is definatly one of their best songs, right up there w/ bullion and Mr Clean"
5,does it get any better?,"Does it get any better than this? No it doesn't. It isnt as fast as their other albums like Life on a plate and same old tunes. But what it is is much more mature music that is enjoyable through every track. I haven't been listening to punk long, but i have already memorized every lyric to the cd, its that good. some of the songs that stand out are no cigar, penguins and polarbears, and stop to think. the ballad is the only song that doesnt seem to fit in with the rest, but it is nothing short of amazing. Its one of those cds that you can just cruise to without ever skipping a song. if you dont have this cd, you are missing out on one the best sounding melodic albums of all time. you will not regret purchasing this cd"
5,comprable to michaelangelo's david...,"this is a beatiful piece of work. ranging from the cover art, to the music, so the printed lyrics. it's just a solid SOLID solid albukm. it's impressive to see how they have changed from same old tunes to life on a plate to four monkeys and now to pennybridge. i suggest that anyone who is a Millencolin fan run, not walk or shuffle, to the nearest record store and buy it now matter how much it costs. another suggestion for a fan is to get their video. it's also really cool, and if you want to see the transitions they've made, it is well documented on this tape. enjoy the disk and i'll see you all on the tour.Millencolin Monkey #1,Matt"
4,Real good CD. Refreshing Punk.,"Millencolin is definitely a breath of fresh air for the punk scene as we know it today. Although I am usually not one to complain about my favorite genre of music, some of it in the ""pop-punk"" category is getting repetitive and overplayed. This group of Swedish rockers blew me away with some of their insanely catchy hooks and lyrics. As with most of the Millencolin albums, there are a couple yawners, but this is thier best CD to date."
3,Definitely Not As Good As Life On A Plate,"This CD was sort of a let-down, Life On A Plate was much better. The music is too repetitive from track to track."
1,Sell Outs,"If you like the fast-paced, punk beat, hardcore Millencolin, then this CD isn't for you. They sound like they tried to make it big like Blink 182 by slowing down their music and trying to make it more poppy, except their guitar riffs are similar each song. Maybe its the new record company but they sold out to punk."
4,"Good condition, great item","I've lways wanted this cd, which is hard to get here in my country. The CD is ok, no scratchers, perfect condition, as well as the booklets. The case however was somewhat loose or broken in one of the joints. Nevertheless, would buy from them again: Fast shipping, great price."
5,rules,"millencolin is a bunch of foreign guys who make little sense singing english, but they kick a** this cd is great and should be owned by all-punk for life"
5,Millencolin's Best!,"Oh man! This CD rulez so much! :) Their new style is kinda KnullPunk, Punk/Rock well it's just another great swedish punk album! You gotta get it RIGHT NOW!"
2,This is one horrible CD!,"After buying this CD i was a little disapointed in how slow the music was, it sounds like alternative rock. This is the worst Millencolin album by far! after listening to it a couple of times I forced myself to like it but got sick of it in a couple of weeks. Then after hearing them in concert on the Punk O Rama tour (it was the best!) I hoped i would like the cd again but it only made me like the previos CDs even more. Millencolin only thinks that they sound better with their new, no ska sound.and I particularly dont like ska. but if your gonna get a Millencolin CD i would definetly recomend Life On A Plate. its their best album yet!"
1,Damaged,Product arrived and handle was broken. I would have taped it and kept the product but when I tried to turn it on nothing happened. The on/off switch is in the handle so I never got a chance to try it. It was returned & I am awaiting a refund.
4,reasonably happy 2b hardcore,"It really was a good CD , but as with all Happy Hard it gets a bit old ,a bit too quick . But hey , for the first 3 weeks or so this CD followed me out of my room and into the car ,I couldn't get enough . The most outstanding feature of this CD series is the fact that ""anabolic Frolic"" has created a good fusion in this genre , rather than making some ""teeny bopper"" dance trash , that should be on the top40 . In summary if you like a bit of light hardcore that will put you in a good mood , buy this ."
1,some rockin tracks but overall bad,"This Cd starts off really exellent tracks 1 and 6 have to be my favs. But as the Cd progresses the quality of songs decline. The Mixing on the Cd is great but there are too many ""crappy-dance sounding be my lover songs"" on here and not enough strait techno songs. I was looking for something a little more like Happy Happy Hardcore-one of my favorite of this style of music.THe mixing on this is great but techno fans beware if you do not like words or singing in your techno do not purchace this album."
4,happy harcore!,"ok, i was kinda dissapointed when i got the cd. i though it would be a lot faster (which most of it all is) than what it was. the best tracks are: #4 ""hear me"", #5 ""all that you see and hear"", #8 ""run to me (which includes a rap solo) #10 ""love of my life"" (the best) i would really go with either the third or 5th cds of the series, (the sound alot faster) than this one. but if this is the speed you want then GET IT! IT WILL OT BE A WASTE OF MONEY! but only if you are a techno fan, if not, it will drive you crazy!"
5,right on!,"anabolic frolic, what can i say? a great DJ, a great promoter and an all around great guy. this CD has so many anthems... its an absolute must have in any hardcore lover's collection."
3,"My cat gave this video ""one tail"" up and walked away.","I judged this video based on my cat's reactions to it, and perhaps my cat is too smart or easily bored. He sat quietly and watched the birdies jumping and hopping, but the only scenes that ""turned him on"" were the ones where the contrast in the film were quite light/dark, and the birds were flying at a distance, or hopping on the ground. In other words, acting like helpless little victims. He didn't like the large ""in your face"" shots of the birds. Half way through he napped off. Perhaps the film maker needs to think more like a cat. I've watched my cat look out the window at birds feeding in the grass for over 10 minutes - he was so transfixed. Overall, the birds were cute and colourful but shot for a human audience and not to excite the hunting instinct of a cat."
3,If only you could see this.....,"I am looking at a photo of 6 cats watching this video. True, the filming quality can be improved (and is improved from Episode One) but this is a decent start. My cats watch regular cable TV anyway, the little couch potatoes - but watching them watch a cat-oriented presentation is a ""hoot.!"""
5,sa1,"this amplifier is very good.have it hooked up to two boston prisub 85 in-ceiling subwoofers and hits way harder than my single 10"" floor sub ever could.this amplifier has two seperate amp channels.at 230watts rms each channel for 460 total watts of rms power.each channel is 4 ohm capable.very flexible wiring capability.Even with the high power ratings it hits so hard and clean i am just amazed with this unit.I have mine mounted in the wall so it is a flush mount;for very clean installation.You can buy this amp for 159.00 refurbished here on amazon.DO IT;IF YOU NEED AN EXTERNAL HOME THEATER SUB AMP THIS IS THE ONE TO GET.my home theater set up is all boston and i have to say it is the best sounding system i have had to date."
2,Incorrect Description,"The ABC's Hands-On Learning Touch and Feel Cards were listed as used and in good condition which they were. But what wasn't listed is K, M and N were missing from the set. There were other sites to purchase these from and I would not have chosen this seller if I had known it was not a complete set.Hands-On Learning Touch and Feel Cards : ABC's (Scholastic Hands-on Learning)"
3,print rollers caput,"Worked great for my office while it worked--fast output, great print quality etc..but almost like clockwork..maybe a few weeks after the warranty expired, the print rollers went caput and the printer is useless. One of my clients noticed the characteristic grinding sound it made as it was in the process of failing, and they smugly commented that their 3321 did the same thing. And of course the cost to repair it beyond the 1 year warranty makes it not work repairing.lexmark said to just go buy another printer instead...and of course I have extra $130 print cartidges that are now just as useless."
2,tried to read this book,my sister got a copy of this book at work from a moslem guy. He tried to get her to convert to mohomad my sister is a baptist so she gave it to me. I never read such a book It was full of crazy talk and it made no sense! It sounded like a drunk wrote it...you know how drunks just ramble and rable on and on and say nothing. That islam guy said that he reads it every day...I cant imagine that....
2,Total Book Candy,This book is a giant piece of candy. This means that it has a stnkin' lot of sweet fatty elements that most books limit. It has tons of gushy romantic fluff. It's very lusty for a Christian fiction but by no means inappropriate.The writing was definitely weak and the dialogue was very contrived. The characters were two dimensional and the storyline fell flat. The dialogue at the end was melodramatic and had me laughing at parts.I wouldn't recommend this book unless it's free and you have an excessive sweet tooth.
5,With Jesus Through Galilee According to the Fifth Gospel,Comprehensive pictorial of Galilee in Israel and facts and information relevant to the topic - a must if you are visiting Israel to plan your trip and also use while you are there.
1,Furniture mover,This product does not perform as advertised. They do not slide well on hardwood floors because they don't stay under the legs of the furniture. You are then pushing against three legs on an angle that does not work well.
1,Don't waste your money!,These things don't work at all!! If I could rate them less than 1 star. I would.
1,lousy,These are the worst sliders I ever bought. They do not stay under leg of bed to move comes right off. Would not recommend to anyone. Waste of money.
3,Mad Lads are Definitely In Action with this CD,"Very under rated group with some excellent soul music, a great find and thanks to Felix Hernandez and his Rhythm Review for playing songs from artists like the Mad Lads as they deserve their due."
4,I liked it,"I think it was a good movie. I don't think they had a huge budget or anything, so that being said, it turned out very nicely. Some of the acting was a little weak, but I doubt I could do better honestly. Anyway, worth checking out."
4,Good stuff,"I got a copy of this movie through a prior release, and I liked it. I have seen a lot of movies, and I have seen a lot of stupid movies. This movie was not one of those I would count in the stupid group. Cool ships and special effects, and a good story. I enjoyed the character relationships in this movie, and hope to see them all together again. I especially liked the robot, Tinman. I have to say he was the coolest character in the movie. Check this one out when you can."
5,Cool concept,"A little dark in areas, but otherwise a great concept show. Loved the characters and the confederation. I also saw Code Red: The Rubicon Conspiracy this past weekend on Sci-fi and I gotta tell you, the makers of that flick for sure used two movies to get all the ideas for their movie. Predator, and this one, Confederation. If Predator and Confederation hooked up and had a kid, it would be Rubicon Conspiracy."
4,Excellent,"I loved this book. The thing is, it's rather old and might be out of date (I'm sure it is). Burgess is a very thorough writer on the openings."
5,Simply the best,Rosemary Clooney was one in a million and she did great honour to these songwriters by singing their songs. Everything she did was perfection and we all miss her very much. Not only did she sing like an angel but now she actually is one and we're the poorer for her los but heaven is richer.
2,Very little singing,"I bought this collection as I first got into the Standards genre. I really wanted to like it, but it seemed like she hardly sang in any of the songs within. Each song (and I do mean every single number) consisted of one or two short verses, followed by a very long instrumental, and ended with a short closing chorus."
4,Easy reading in a very organized format,I enjoyed Ed Young's book fresh language and clearly organized ideas. The books is down to earth and applicable to any Christian. It would even be a good tool for evangelism.
1,Never received,I never received the book. I had to send several emails to check the status and was told it was shipped. I finally requested a refund.
2,Save your money!,"I collect Junior League cookbooks & rarely am I disappointed. This one is the exception. While it's a pretty book & well put together, the content leaves a lot to be desired. I'm not a fan of cake mix cakes or main dish recipes calling for cream of whatever soup & Velveeta cheese. There are several recipes I've seen in other books & nothing I'm just dying to try. I wish them luck in their next venture, though as I know the money goes to a good cause."
1,Wonderful example of literary garbage,"I had the great misfortune of borrowing this book from a friend (thank god she only paid $1 for it and 5 other books in a grab-bag from a charity book sale at the library). The little pleasure I derived from this book was brought on by its unintentionally hilariously twisted plot. It's a true gem of self-published awfulness. One gets the impression that the author (if you can call him that) must have written this story to spite some girl that broke his heart in high school.Maybe, one day, he'll grow out of it and write a real novel. Until then, it's obvious why he's the only one willing to publish his work."
2,It's really all about the Cheese.,"Truly, this would be an interesting book for those whose life revolves around cheese. There's a few poems about cheese and some historical events which included cheese. The author has included lots of trivia with cheese information. The parts I read did not get into the process of cheese making nor included any recipes for making cheese or the use of cheese in meals.I could not read too much into the book (only about 35%) due to the dry nature of the book. There were no errors that I came across. The structure of the kindle version was fine - sans a few alignment issues.I was more or less expecting something along the lines of recipes with cheese and was thus a bit disappointed.Good for someone with a fascination with cheese."
4,Good cheese history,"I got this book looking for information on the process of cheese making. It has very little specific information on that, but I did enjoy reading the history and geographic influences that have shaped cheese over the centuries."
2,"Well, it was free.","So I can't complain too much, I suppose. But I found the book boring, pretentious and tedious to read. Great to browse if you can't sleep."
1,cheesebook,This book is an excellent book for true cheese experts. If you are like me and only know ten or less cheese do not bother' you will be bored.
2,Not a beginners book,"""Camembert is equally good on thin slices of apple, pineapple, pear French ""flute"" or pumpernickel. As-with Brie and oysters, Camembert should be eaten only in ""R"" months, and of these September is the best.""I made it through about 5% of the book before giving up on it. If the quote above is the depth of completeness your looking for this is the book for you. If you care anything about where or why a particular cheese comes from, how it is made, or what makes it special, this is not the book for you. Chock full of poems and cute say's it is not what I would call a ""Complete"" book of cheese.The kindle edition has a working contents section with links to an appendix with entries like the following""Camembert; Germany, US & elsewhere. A West German imitation that comes in a cute little heart-shaped box which nevertheless doesn't make it more like the Camembert veritable of Normandy"""
1,Reads like a bad online journal,Nice idea but please put it back in the oven because this one's not done yet. The writing is lazy and unpolished and suffers from a serious case of using adjectives as filler. It truly reads like someone's first online journal.Useful 'tips' elements are few and far between (you'll be better served picking up a proper frugal travel guide/tipsbook) and the 'tales' are somewhat unmarkable and hampered by labored writing.
5,So much better than the original,"This is hilarious - currently standing up to its third reading, I consider it an absolute masterpiece. If you've read the Drear-Vinci Codes, buy it or borrow it, but make sure you read it!"
2,A PATHETIC PARODY TO A GOOD BOOK,"To set the record straight, I didn't think that ""The Da Vinci Code"" was all that excellent. I'd say an even 4 out of 5 stars. Maybe it was because I read ""Angels and Demons"" first--I liked that book much more.Anyway, I am always open to parodies, even if they poke fun at books I like. ""Bored of the Rings"" was a great parody on Tolkien's epic series.As for the ""Asti Spumante Code"", I have to admit that I got a short laugh at the beginning of this book and one more later on that involved a toilet, but after that I don't ever recall laughing and it got agonizing reading and reading, hoping to come across something funny. In fact, the last part of the book could almost pass as serious.Two laughs = two stars"
1,Ugly shape for a book? If only it wasn't!,"I agree with Plate of Pasta and Plate of Shrimp. I haven't read the book, either, of course, but it just looks ugly on the shelves in the shops. It is kind of squat, so I don't think it will fit in with the nice line of books that I have at home in my trailer. For that reason I give it only one star."
1,No 'g' in the title,"i have no plans to read this book. even if i did have i would not be able to, because i only read books that have the letter 'g' in the title. this writer has not thought to include all letters of the alphabet in his book's title. one star only."
2,not good quality,a week after i purchased this item all the of the legs loosened and fell off including the little things in the bottom of the chair legs.
1,turned into rags after one washing,very sad to have paid almost a thousand for this entire set and after the first washing the comforter and shams turned all raggedy with the seams all ripped wide open showing the batting inside. the boudoir pillow was nothing fantastic. the beads fall off easily. regret this purchase.
3,Long time buyer,"I have purchased this longline bra for 3 years. For the money it is a good value, however they do not hold-up well, I wash them in a longerie bag in cold water on delicate and never dry them. They hold their shape for about 4-6 months. It would be great if the manufacturer could do a ""seamless cup"" since the seams show very badly under sheer fabrics or tee shirts. Also the cup sizes run small."
2,"Not a scarce bra, and NOT a posture bra!!","This bra will not help your posture. Also, these bras are not rare, you can get them a SEARS, where you can TRY THEM ON before you buy them. I tried three different sizes, all to no avail. All three were returned to Amazon."
3,flattering and well fitting,"This bra fits very well, but I can't give it a high rating because the straps do not adjust or stretch.I've found higher quality bras like this that ended up being the same price because I got free shipping from the other company.My advice is; shop around for a better quality bra with adjustible straps."
3,Good product overall,Long line Bra. i am a 36 B so that is what I purchased. It was a little tighter around my body than I expected. Cup size seems true. It does help to give some back support and also gives me a better shape. I would purchase again.
3,Helps but tight,"Really helps with the back its just a little too tight, after 8 hours you just want to take it off.."
4,Good Value,"Good Fit Good Value! Easy to wear looks good under clothing without hassles. I buy this model often. Sizing available, which is convenient."
3,Don't care about people reviews!!!!,"It runs true size. I red previous reviews that it does not run true size and I bought 2 sizes up as they recommed, and it is toooo big for me!but the longline bra is nice and comfortable."
2,Cup runs large,"The item seems well made. I have not worn it yet since the cups were TOO large and will have to return the item for a smaller size. I ordered a 38C based on the reviews to order a size up. The 38C seems to be more of a DD cup than a C cup. The 38 was to loose for my body. Overall, the bra did not fit properly."
3,not exactly what i was hoping for...,"I purchased this bra with very high hopes of it being like the bras I remembered my mother as having in my younger years. I was looking for a bra that would provide back support, a smooth look under clothing, and would stay in place without digging in to my shoulders or piercing into my sides from heavy boning. While I did receive some back support and it did remain in place, there was much to be desired as far as the way this bra looked under clothing and that fact that it did not remain in place. God forbid I should move at all, the darn thing would flip up at the bottom. I will never again purchase this item, and am back on my quest for a supportive, well fitting longline bra."
1,Never received the book,I paid for the book and expected it to arrive before September29 but never received anything . I would like to find out why?
5,This is the real Monteverdi,"Searching for the right interpretation of this music it took me over 25 years to find this extraordinary performance by Maria Christina Kiehr e.o. Finally this wonderful music is interprated in my personal taste. But how could it not be, as Kiehr is a member of the 'Vlaamse School' with Rene Jacobs and Philippe Herreweghe as most prominent members and master teachers. If you listen i.e. to track 4: 'O quam pulchra es' then you might experience what I mean. This is the right way to travel to the real Monteverdi. She is at the same level as Andreas Scholl. I hope more musicians will realize this in the future. Well done Maria Christina, I know it was the hard way, because you experienced lots of criticism. I really hope you enjoy us with your lovely voice again and again in future. Every aincient music lover should take notice of this recording, it is a wonderfull experience. Five stars!"
4,Inside The Postal Bus: My Ride With Lance Armstrong,"Like many Americans, suddenly cycling is of keene interest to me. This book lets me live the experience vicariously in good human detail. From the sore muscles and the pain of keeping up with the pelaton, to the horrendous crashes that every cyclist experiences, this book lets you ride along and feel what they feel. The boys in postal blue, have a super demanding schedule, but they also have loads of fun while they do what they do so well.Even though I'm way over 60, I cycle every day though at a mere 13 mph average, so this book lets me imagine doing it at 25 to 30 mph.While the style of the writer is not as polished as it could be, it doesn't matter. This is a keeper. Be sure to get your copy."
2,Dry and flavorless,"I, too, am pure tifosi and really, really wanted to enjoy this. I remember my own racing days and can talk for hours on end, telling story after story: ""Remember that time when...""Michael Barry either cannot or chooses not to.There's a pretty good description of the malaise experienced by a professional cyclist mired in a 3-week tour at the end of the book. There are momentary bright spots and little tidbits of trivia that may bring a smile. Unfortunately, the majority of the book is taken up with a spectator's view of Lance Armstrong. Mr. Barry drags us through the 2004 Tour de France from the comfort of his television set; he wasn't on the team that competed that year. And this is the core of the book.Overall, the book has SO much potential, but Mr. Barry cannot bring it to fruition. Bike racing is fun and funny, and full of wonderful stories. This book is not. It is as dull and subdued as the colors of the racing team it follows.Meh."
1,Big Disappointment,"No stories, no inside view, no organization, no reason to waste your time with this book. I was excited when I bought this book and once I started to read it I was wondering when it would become a good read. It never did. The author painted a professional bike racer's life as one big bore."
1,Misleading title,"If you are new to cycling then you will learn a few things in this book. But if you are already a cycling fan looking to learn more about Lance or US Postal, you won't find it here. This guy was so much an outsider that he doesn't have much insight."
1,Ever hear of an editor?,"I bought this book with high hopes; however, it just proved some athletes need to stick with sports and not writing. I could never tell when Barry was in the past or present. The book jumps around and gives very little account of the people inolved. The journalism is poor, the writing is poor, and the editing is worse.If you have $15 to blow and have read every other cycling book, then buy it. If not, choose something else."
3,average at best,"I liked the inside look at a pro team but the writing was simplistic and reminded me of someone writing home from summer camp. Very little here outside of ""what I did today."""
3,A Little Bit of Almost Everything (Except a Good Editor),"The bad news is that this book obviously had no editor. It appears to be a verbatim reprint of Michael Barry's thoughts/musings over the course of the 2004 season. There is virtually no organization and quite a bit of repetition - the end result is an effort that would make even an average high school student cringe.But the good news is that ""Inside the Postal Bus"" is an enjoyable ride for fans of cycling both new and old. I didn't learn much new (the subtitle lure of a year with Lance is a bit misleading), but it was a good way of getting a ""cycling fix"" at the start of the 2005 season.There is no way I would pay $21.95 for a book this poorly written if it were not for the fact this is a niche book with a limited publication run. Regardless, Michael Barry seems to be a very nice guy and hopefully my purchase and those of fellow fans will put a few extra dollars in his pocket."
3,Great Introduction to Coffee & Cycling,"Michael Barry's view ""Inside the Postal Bus"" gives a great introduction to cycling, and includes some funny excerpts about the hotels, bus, and coffee machines that keep the team rolling. This is a quick read, and offers more perspectives on cycling than JUST ""the"" Tour, which is nice. The writing is not too sophisticated (most cyclists don't go on to college) but who cares?! He finally gives some of the riders OTHER than Lance and some OTHER races some coverage. If you are real Tour fan, this book covers some of the basics (meaning the jerseys, etc.) that we have heard over and over again but bear with it."
2,flat and uninteresting,"Sorry, I couldn't even make it thru a full listening. The music has no character. If you want something truly exciting in this genre, check out Cassandra Wilson, Traveling Miles and New Moon Daugter."
2,not my cup of tea,"Patricia Barber is an artist I only know from CD recordings so I can only judge her latest CD on the basis of my listening and my own prejudices. I have not seen her perform live, so the review is based only on listening to Modern Cool.Eight out of twelve songs are Paticia Barber's own compositions, so we get a real flavor of her music. The other four are familier songs that Peggy Lee and others popularized a number of years ago.The CD has a dark feeling, for me, and does not make me push the repeat button. After a couple of listenings I removed the CD and set it aside and will try it again later, but I doubt that it will become one of my jazz standards. I think Patricia Barber does a nice job on the standards but her own compositions are too quirky for my tastes, and leave me an uncomfortable listener. However, I am the first to admit, when I heard Miles Davis play years ago, I did not like what I heard, and it took multiple listenings for me to really enjoy his work."
4,joe cocker of jazz,"Barber was in Halifax for the jazz festival last summer.....not knowing anything about her I went with an opener mind.She plays piano a bit like joe cocker sings,hands all over the place and very emotive.Once you get used to the distraction of a pianist withrubber arms i settled into really liking the music.Her band is sufficiently eclectic and sometimes dischordant to go along with the jarring you often get from her lyrics (which are dealt with in the amazon review above).Having listened to her for a while you understand why a cover of the Doors Light My Fire fits right in to the program.This is both music and tune writing that will challenge you to expand your listening vocabulary and will take you onto other artists who have things to say like Dave's True Story or Rebecca Pidgeon."
4,"Spine tingling, breathtakingly powerful music.","If you are listening to a piece of music that makes the small hairs on the back of your neck stand up straight, then you are probably hearing music like that performed by Patricia Barber on ""Modern Cool"". Don't expect a cocktail-time lullaby from ""Modern Cool""; this is intense, demanding, power-house music. Ms. Barber's writing and playing captivates and glues you to your chair. Her excellent choice of brilliant sidemen only adds more momentum to this outstanding date. For this listener, ""Let It Rain"", could be the only piece on the CD, and it would still be the best album I've heard this year. And by the way, if your audio system is a piece discount store junk, I pity you. This recording is audiophile stuff...you can play it for your guests and watch them go into cardiac arrest!"
2,Relatively New To Jazz..,"Have been picking up ""classics"" like Sketches of Spain, Kind of Blue, Time Out, thought i would try something more modern - was that a mistake. There is very little in the way of melody on this record - or even a memorable song. Some of it is just plain unlistenable such as ""constantinople"" or ""light my fire"". I guess there is a market for a ""butch"" Dianne Krall but her material really cant compare."
4,SACD is worth the price.,"This is a great CD and I love Patricia Barber but I think that she trys to hard to be hip and cool. More than once I wanted to yell at my speakers, ""<em>calm down you're Patricia Barber, relax why dontchya</em>"" but other than her stepping on herself a couple of times Modern Cool is a must own title. She's A Lady is worth the price of admission all by its self."
4,"Great music, great artist, but CD limited by recording","I bought this alblum strickly on a recommendation. I usually listen to just classical music. I was surprised, and disappointed. The performance is outstanding. I just love the music. But the technical side of the recording almost makes me get rid of it (almost). You have to play this at low volumes, or on a system with limited low end response. TOO MUCH BASS, far to much. It could use a bit more highs and detail. But again, the music is great...a very pleasant surprise. I think I will try out another of her recordings soon."
4,"Definatley Modern, Extremely Cool","After hearing ""Let It Rain"" on the local jazz station a couple of times, I know that I would soon be having a love affair with the new Patricia album. It lived up to every one of my expectations. I can't stop listenening to the dark voice of Patricia."
4,It's What Hip Hop Needs,"Ok, so yeah, it's probably racist, but so is any other album that directs its violence towards other blacks. If anything, let's hope Dead Prez are just exaggerating some of their views, but this album, while being extremely listenable, may also start discussions about race, as long as the listeners take everything DP says with a grain of salt."
2,approach wisely,"It is a shame that this album is so offensive. Most of the album is well constructed & ""Hip Hop"" is one of the best songs I've heard come out of this genre in a while (as well as an interesting commentary on the current direction of hip hop).However, the racist content should offend persons of all ethnic backgrounds. The artists' manner of addressing such a contemporary concern is dispensable - there are more suitable lyrical means for expressing their ideas (see Public Enemy). I urge you to research this album before purchasing it."
5,"A must have, 5 stars+","Wow..when i bough this CD i had only heard ofD Dead PRez and was told this was a great CD...grat doesnt even begin to describe Dead Prez...this is one of those 'must have' CD's..like BIG's Ready to Die, NAs' Illmatic, and Bone Thugs' East 1999...buy it now"
1,Dead Prez,This cd is not for white people not unless you hate white people.It is a very negative album and i think some African Americans NEED to get some help for writing lyrics like the ones used in this cd
4,Politics As Usual,"A revolutionary LP in Hip hop. 2 MC's backed by beats that'll give you the chills & narratives about police, politics, & inner city problems. A very needed listen in this day in age."
5,Brilliant album in terms of its political ideas,"The album is the strongest and compared to most other albums, this is a lot stronger than PE's debut album. Of course, white people could definitely be offended by the political thrust but the fact that both artists argue in an essay-like polemic is quite brilliant. Considering that so much rap is perfunctory and not aggressive with its beats (which have a threatening calmness). Of course, the socialist stance is quite unorthodox against the usual Jigga attitude. I highly recommend this album for open minds definitely. Of course, the utter simplicity of its complex problems is a consicousness raising experience definitely.Word and peaze, DJ X-Caliber"
3,Nothing too Bad,-There are 20 empty tracks in-between the songs; so when listening to a CD player it doesn't play continuously- The CD case isn't a real CD case- Good quality music- Dead Prez's best is on here- Arrived on time with no hassle
4,One of the Better Hip-Hop albums out,"I listened to all of Dead Prez, and I must say that this is one of the greatest cds I have heard in a while. Even though they somewhat bash my race I respect their veiws. They schools is a great song. My father is a teacher, so I know alot about schools. I also like Dead Prez's new album becuase it seems to be very controversial. I mean they censored the cover. I think it's good that they expressed something about the Sowedos. All in all this is a great cd. If you are a white man, that doesn't take kindly to people talking about all the problems with the white race and you don't like hearing the word Cracker, then this album is not for you. But if you are a white person, like myself, and you can handle that sort of thing, and can understand where these guys are comeing from and respect what they have to say, then this cd is definitely reccomended. Thank you."
3,Too Angry...,"Dead Prez debut album is going to shock new listeners. Yeah they have tight messages but this joint would have been great for the Public Enemy, Brand Nubian and X-Clan days..We are at a point in the black community where pointing the finger is old and will get us nowhere. these young mc's can flow and the production is great but the vision is just a little too militant..."
1,Let's Get Free didn't deliver for me.,I thought this cd would be great but it turned out to be a one hit wonder for me. The only song I like is #4 Hip Hop. All the other songs just miss the bar. My advice is to listen to the samples of the songs and then make your own judgement. I'll just stick to Lil' Flip.
3,enough already!,"this album is aight! I mean off the bat their damn complaining can get on anyone's nerves. I realize all those homies aren't rich and famous, but they seem to think the whites and cops are to blame for it all! This entire cd is offensive, not only to whites, but to blacks as well. It's got some decent songs that deal with something OTHER than racism. All in all, it's worth gettin, if you can take all the bitchin and hatred."
3,An OK cd,"I got a sample tape for dead prez and static-x and I found out dead prez was so good!!!! They sweared too much and It got to annoying, so I got the edited version. The cd is gangster rap, and relates to the Wu-TangClan a bit. I thought the cd was a bit dark and there song's were too similar. It turned out to be way to much rap for me. I was a bit dissapointed since the song I heard was more impressive than the song's on this cd. But if you like the Wu, this cd is a must buy"
1,Quite possibly the worst album I've ever bought,"Purchased this after hearing good words about it. Told it was political, a la Public Enemy (to site a trite exemplar of poli-rap), & organic, a la Roots (another trite exemplar of a particular rap sect). So, liking much of the output of each subgenre to which I heard DP compared, I expected good things. I put it on the ol' laptop Cd player, though, & got nothing from it. The instrumental backing was deadening, the flow uneven, the politics not-thought-thru... If there is one thing --- in fact, it's the only thing --- I don't need in my record collection, it's bad music that the artists are obviously trying to hard on whild having too little ability to actualize what they are trying hard on... & the Dead Prez disc Let's Get Free, same as the entire Reggie & the Full Effect catalogue, Tool's Lateralus, & Dylan after '75, is bad. Plain & simple."
2,An ending that didn't exist,"Although this book was one of, if not the first book published about DID aka MPD, it is wrong. Although we are told that ""Mrs. White"" was cured at the end of the book, that was a fantasy created by her psychiatrist. This book is about 3 of the many personalities that Chris Costner Sizemore has had in her life. If you want the real story, try I'm Eve, written by Sizemore.It is unfortunate that this book remains available when the true and more complete story is unavailable."
1,it was...,"it was ok, it came on time, but the top of the clogen was bent and stuff had spelt in the box so there was a little more then half a bottle left and the package was saturated in the clogen"
1,Phone Charger,I ordered two of these chargers and they both broke. It is so flimsy that the wires pulled out of the plug with easy insertion and removal from the phone.
2,wrong charger,I bought hthis for my cell phoen by accident it was the wrong one. they shipped quickly it was great. now i need one for a motorola
2,Not worth the trouble,"When I bought this item new it worked fine. I had no problems with it, that is until the cords came out of the charger while it was in use. Im glad those hot wires didnt end up electricuting me in the process. I guess u get what you pay for. I wouldn't buy another on of these."
4,Great sound but not as forgiving as I expected,"The reason I purchased the 8260 was not for the SACD feature, but the enhanced sonic quality this player provides even on standard CDs AND the fact it has a built-in high-quality headphone amp. On these two counts I am delighted with the 8260.What has been disappointing is the inability of the 8260 to track through even slight fingermarks or surface problems on CDs, especially CD-Rs. The thing is built like a tank, so it's hard to understand how the pickup could be that sensitive. My cheaper players will play the same discs flawlessly, so I'm a bit miffed.Since the unit has a 3 year warranty, I will call Marantz and see what they have to say (and provide an update at that time)."
5,A Wise Investment,"If you are new to high-end cd players the price tag on the SA8260 might seem incredibly high considering it doesn't even play DVDs. Some might ask, ""...what is the point of buying a cd-player that won't also play a DVD?"" There are a myriad of reasons that ultimately contribute to the truest and most incredible musical reproduction that you may ever encounter (particularly for such a price-point as low as this).And, if you are not familiar with SACD technology let's say that in short they don't call it SUPER AUDIO CD for nothin'. You don't really need to spend this much money to play back an SACD, but you also may not enjoy music enough to invest in a player of this quality level...and that is fine.I am at some loss for words when it comes to describing how good the SA8260 is. The quality of this player side by side with other players will leave you breathless!"
1,Don't do it!,"Don't waste your money, it broke the first time I used it. Being an ex-firefighter, I wouldn't trust this product on my families lives!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SPHYGMOMANOMETER,"I'm a medical student and purchased this sphygmomanometer to use for practice in a clinical medicine course. It seemed like a good deal, but I used it maybe ten times before the tubing simply fell apart. You get what you pay for. Invest in a quality device and avoid this one if at all possible. A lifetime calibration warranty is useless if the thing comes apart."
1,Looks good,"This product was defective, I was lucky I had a blood pressure cuff that was broken. The inflation device was faulty and you can tell all of the cuffs from this site are more than likely the same way. I waited to long, I would have sent this product back for a refund."
2,The gauge stopped working,I give this sphygmomanometer a two because the gauge stopped working after taking 1 BP. This product probably would be of good quality and I'm really hoping that my experience was the exception.
5,Window Washer,My husband needed something to help with washing the siding near the top of our house. This works perfectly!! He loves it!
3,Could have been 5 stars,"Rose Madder begins as Rosie leaves her abusive husband after 14 years of violence. What a great start! The characters are King's most real and 3 dimentional ever. Rosie exibits all the classic signs of an abused woman. She show the strength to leave and try to begin her life again. Norman, her husband, is the scariest villain in any King novel. This is because he is belivable. He is driven by human emotions: hate, pride, lust, insanity. Norman could give Hanibal Lector a run for his money. Which brings me to why I gave 3 stars instead of 5. Just when things start to get interesting King introduces a supernatural element. I know, I know, I'm reading a Stephen King novel, but I feel this one could have done without his usual ghosts and demons. The supernatural elements felt forced and out of place. The characters alone could have driven this novel to a satisfing conclusion. Good but could have been better."
2,The worst,"I have read most of King's books, and this one was one of the worst. It started out good but then it just got cataclysmically stupid. I do not recommend."
1,A waste of trees,"It's hard to understand how someone brilliant enough to write the emotionally challenging ""The Green Mile"" could also be responsible for this utter tripe. My only theory is that it was part of several-title book deal that had to be ready on time, and Mr King (who is usually a conscientous and diligent worker) decided not to rush any of the stories that were worth pursuing. Spare yourself this title, folks: the segments that don't send you to sleep will more likely have you snickering with unintentional bemusement. I am deeply thankful the majority of Stephen King's work is immensely superior to this waste of trees."
1,No new ideas.,"Rose Madder is a mix of many other elements of King novels, battered spouse, psychotic husband, images of spiders, and a fantasy realm all adding up to one of King's worst novels. The characters are caricatures rather than well drawn personalities. (usually a major strength of King)There is not one surprise in this book as the husband gets crazier, Rose gets more frightened and Greek mythology becomes a factor. I generally enjoy the works of this author and I found this book an anomaly in a career filled with excellent work."
1,PAINFUL,"To sum it up...I tried to read this book twice and never got to page 200. A little voice told me not to finish the book and I'm glad I listened because I read a synopsis that revealed the pathetic ending of the book. The beginning was realistic and barely held my attention. Toward the middle and end of the book King dives out into a wild tangent with a laughable fantasy plot involving the painting rose madder. If you hated the book Insomnia, then definitely avoid Rose Madder."
3,Good story. Poor grammar.,I have been reading the Kindle Edition of the novel and am dismayed at the large amount of typographical and grammatical errors found within the text. I am thoroughly enjoying the story's plot but am appalled by the misspellings and incorrect word usage littered through out the text. I am surprised the publisher has allowed the book to be released with so many errors. It's upsetting and frustrating to read a published novel that is full of mistakes.
5,Scared my Silly!,"Oh goodness, I periodically had to lock this book away and turn on ALL the lights and turn ALL my paintings so they'd face the wall and sing many happy tunes so I woulnd't be scared! ROSE MADDER was terrifying to me. I suggest you read it with a big cup of latte but better make it a decaf! Not too hot because you might spill it on a new pair of pants. I want to tell you what happened but I better not! Oh, I need some Rolaids! This book gave me hives! And a beehive hairdo! Rose dies in the end. No she doesn't . Just kidding. Maybe. Ha ha ha."
3,people shouldn't be looking for reality,"I was surprised it took so long for Stephen King to step away from the reality. I hated Norman Daniels but I loved how well developed he was. I loved the use of ""The Name Game."" as for comments on his dialogue it's an age old thing you can't have great dialogue and great description.when I read King i want his detail. This book wasn't his greatest plot nor did it have his greatest heroine but the end was pretty good it showed that ones past resonates throughout their lives. Rose proved at the end to be much more complex than she seemed to be."
1,This book stank!,"I used to like King's novels, but as I grew older, I found some of the themes he choses for his stories to be on the childish side. With Rose Madder, King seems to want to grow up and tackle a serious subject-that of spousal abuse. However, he fails miserably for the simple reason that the book is damn boring. Moreover, King's patented stupidity creeps in here and there, mixing fantasy and other boring silliness, when the subject of spousal abuse itself would have been enough to provide serious horror and drama. Also, the villain (norman something) is too one-sided and cartoon-like to be ever taken seriously. In short, the book is a phony mixture of melodrama and silliness. that'll put most readers to sleep."
2,As bad as he can get,"I generally do not do reviews. That said, I have read just about everything King has written and this one is at the bottom of my list. And most of you know there are a few of his that just do not make it do to poor plot, too long, or not that creative. In some ways he has developed a formula (many authors have) and King sticks to it too much; or in this case gets so far off that the story is very forgetable.Dr. Tox."
1,A HORRIBLE WASTE OF TIME,"This book was absolutely the worst book that I have ever read in my life, including all of the little teeny-bopper novels I reveled in in my teen years. Nora, the main character, was sadly also the most irritating and flattest character, and I almost ripped the book into shreds when I reached the final chapters. I can't believe that I forced myself to finish reading this book and that I wasted my 5.95 or however much it was on it. I hope Stephen King gets himself together after writing one of his most mundane, predictable, and silliest novels ever. I feel sorry for whoever takes the time out to read this,"
4,Very Intriguing Novel,"I David, havn't read this yet, but have read numerous opinions of it. I have read all of SK's novels xcept for 5. IT was my 1st novel & favorite. I hope this gives relations to his Dark Tower series, The Talisman, IT, The Dead Zone, Black House or The Tommyknockers."
2,mixed,"no matter how i look at this work, ican't be satisfied. a wife runs from an abusive husband. she must create a new life. her husband begins to hunt for her. but that is part A. part B is that there is another world welcoming rose, trying to protect here. here is where the real goodies are. good descriptions, though not that great in concept. pretty bad actually. but this is where it gets interesting. actually the book may not be so bad, but it got abit confusing. was i supposed to experience thrills? horror? drama? this seemed to be a mix. the synthesis isn't healthy. some of the stuff here gets...corny. especially between rose and her ""admirer"". this could have been a good read, but it's so mixed i'm having problems digesting it. it just seemed incomplete, confusing, or a bit amateurish."
3,Still Reading...,"i'm about half way through with this book, and I'm still on the fence. It's well written and truly terrifying (especially if you're a wife), but I don't know think it's very exciting. I'm not up all night dying to know what happens next."
2,Did stephen king really write this one???,"First I'd like to state that i really love almost everything by king. This book is a real stupid one. Nothing speacial about it, it has only two real simple plots that innonate nothing. Maybe the heberw translater was a real bad one, or king just wrote a stupid book."
3,Starts great but dives in the end.,"This book starts out great and you will really feel Rose's pain. However, the ending leaves something left to be desired. The concept was good but the ending just didn't do it for me. I just read Bag of Bones and it really shook me up, Rose Madder didn't emotionally charge me nearly the same way, but it's still a good read."
3,Good read,Rose Madder was a very good read. I would definitely recommend it! I empathize with Rosie and feel her pain to the fullest.
1,Very disappointed about the condition this book was in when I received it in the mail,"I love Rose Madder, it is my all time favorite book. I needed to buy a new copy because I wore my old one out, and I wanted another hard cover copy. I found a really great deal on one, it was only $1 and shipping was like $5. So, I waited and waited and finally it came in the mail. The dealer I purchased it from had wrapped it in flimsy Christmas wrapping paper and half the wrapping paper was gone and the book was all torn up! Instead of putting it in a box or padded envelope, the seller chose to pocket the shipping and handling money. I was so angry, no book should endure that kind of damage. I will never buy from this seller again! Beware!"
2,Not Stephen King caliber,Stephen King has written some great horror books and even good non-horror like Four Seasons. But this book is by far his worst peice of work yet. I'm almost reluctant to read any more of his works.
1,"It was ""iffy.""","This book, this Stephen King book, has some text in an order which was easily digested by me, and, presumably, most of the populi. Everything about the story was quite clear. Very clear. I was sickened. It displayed no new ideas about storytelling or writing. It displayed no new ideas at all. Perhaps this is an idication that Stephen King is simply out to claim as many book TITLES as he can, so he can win some contest I haven't heard of. Or, perhaps he likes watching workmen file into his living room with tubs of money and pizza and those superfluous ""delivery video rental"" movies. Do those delivery people just stand there whilst you watch the movie, or do they go back to the rental place to wait?? And, what if you want to pause the tape just as Uma Thurman is taking her top off and gawk at it for a half-hour...do they charge you for more movie-watching time? Anyway, this book occupies a vacuum. Don't read it."
4,Much Better than Average,"As usual, King's character descriptions are vivid and dead on. The story is engaging and readers who like the old King ""scary stuff"" won't be disappointed. A bit predictable and the love story is a little corny for my tastes, but wait til you see Rose Madder - she's definitely a show-stopper. And the movie's coming out when?"
4,Engaging on many levels,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to read a book based on spousal abuse, but the more I got to know Rosie, the more I hated Norman and just had to keep on reading. I found it empowering to be on Rosie's side - as she found her empowerment in the painting. The painting evokes so much emotion from Rosie...and the mythological symbolism of the minotaur, the labyrinth, the river of forgetfulness, the Demeter/Persephone pomegranate allusion...brings so much clarity to the levels on which the story can be read. I am sure I will reread it - if nothing else to be able to put Norman to rest again, as that felt really good (but I have to admit I wished he was caught by the police and suffered in the real world - but the punishment in that wouldn't be as capital as the painting's). The end - where Rosie trips with her own madness...very scary. It's amazing how some cycles perpetuate."
3,I'm being generous with 3 stars.,The story was long and boring. I chugged through the last 100 pages in a day because I was dieing to read The Shining. I thought it was going to be good so I picked it up off the shelf in the store instead of Dolores Claiborne BIG MISTAKE! This was the worst King book I have ever read. I will never read it again. If your thinking of reading a Stephen King book do not read this one first. You may be turned off from his books for good. I kind of enjoyed the fantasy element. I recommend not to read this book and read The Shining or It two GREAT examples of great novels. This is not your every day King book but then again are any.
4,this is an unforgetable book,"out of all of the king books that i have read this was the most spellbinding,unforgetable,and emotional book yet. when reading the book i could feel rose's pain and heartache. ROSE MADDER is by far one of the greatest books i've read."
4,4 1/2 Stars,"I almost wanted to give it 5 stars, just becuz to ME, it's Stephen King's writing at it's best. His WRITING. Not necessarily his storytelling. I personally happen to love his writing just as much as his stories themselves. I didnt want to miss a WORD of this book. There is no author like him, to me - and i read many, many other authors also.It did get a little long to me...and i'm not big on ""suspense,"" but when he's writing it, i'll eat it up...his style makes everything fun to read. I wouldnt tell anyone who loves Stephen King to ""skip this one."" I loved it!!"
3,Rose Madder is ok,"Rose Madder by Stephen King is all right. I chose to rate this a three because I have read much better books by King than this. Rose McClendon-Daniel's is an abused wife. Her husband is a strong, smart police officer. When Rose decides she has had enough, she walks out of his life. He is outraged and humiliated. He sets out to find her in the new city where she has started her new life with the help from a few kind strangers. There are many twists and surprises that keep you reading, and you want to see what's going to happen next. There are some really funny parts in this book, for example the confrontation between Norman and a large lady named Gert. This book is a light read, even though it looks big. Some parts may require some thought, but most read easily. It does not take long to read, I finished in a weekend. I recommend it to those that like Stephen King and are looking for something quick to read."
4,A Chilling Look at Domestic Abuse Through King's Eyes,"Rose Madder by Stephen King brings to life a dream for anyone who has ever been belittled...revenge. In this book Rose gets even with her abusive husband in a strangely beautiful picture purchased at a pawn shop. She ultimately kills him in a fantasy world which carries over into reality. One complaint-King transports us into this world with no explanation, which can be puzzling. But it all ends up well as the ""bad guy"" dies, and Rose lives happily (?) ever after."
4,Some real powerful parts,"I found the book, especially the beginning, very powerful. The inner workings of terror and evil are Kings strong suite."
2,From the ridiculous to the Sublime,"I have read many SK books - from early stuff to latest - and they have been pretty good. Unfortunately, RM is a disappointment. Plot and characters start off well enough, but it eventually degenerates into psychological twaddle once the painting is purchased. Sorry SK - could do better!"
2,"Bad book, don't read!!","This King book is one of his most boring works ever. I love Stephen King, but this book is a huge bore!"
2,"Sorry, Steve, but this one just didn't cut it...","Hey, you win a lot, lose a few...but others seemed to have loved it, so more power to you. I was thrilled by the beginning, irritated by the end. Nevertheless, it was a creative attempt, and I always admire that in any artist. I just wish King had stayed with reality instead of suddenly jumping into fantasy. Nothing wrong with fantasy, but it just didn't ""go"" here, at least for me. I finished it, but it was a grueling experience. I kept hoping it would get good again. Also - the ending was a feminist tract. And I am a dyed-in-the-wool feminist. I just don't love blatant politics with my fiction. Now, for a subtle feminist novel, one that really packs a punch in that area, read Deloris Claiborne - it's a masterpiece of courageous womanhood against the odds."
2,Only Good for Writers looking to Discern technique,"As a fellow writer I admire Stephen King's novels filled with creativity. Yes, this book drags on too long, yes it's repetitive (I wanna talk to you, up close), yes the characters are characatures, and yes the painting concept is ill-conceived.That said, it was worth reading for me as a writer because it gave me some good ideas to use for my own writing. I'd say the weakest part of King's book is the dialogue, but you have to know how difficult it can be to invent dialogue for fictional characters. The strongest aspect of his writing is descibing what goes on in his character's minds. This he's masterful at. But I'd say the more realistic the characters and story, the better the fiction. The characters in this novel are not well developed. Speaking as a regular reader, the book draws you in with an interesting scenario and just keeps you interested enough to keep reading."
2,TYPICAL of KING,"He never fails to dissapoint me. (with the exception of Delores Claiborne)As usual, he reels you in with an intense, easy to read storyline and then lets you die a slow, agonizing death through the last 1/3 of the book. Too sci-fi with the painting. The most horrifying aspects of any of King's novels have been characters/events that can actually exist - THAT is horror. Not some boogeyman/bull in an animated oil painting. He should learn to leave well enough alone instead of going off on a (bizarre) tangent every time."
1,Bombed half-way through!,"Why incorporate supernatural events into a book without explaining them adequately? Rose Madder has a supernatural sequence weaved into the plot which leaves the reader astounded. The character development is terrific, and up until a picture comes to life, the book has a lot of potential, but bombs completely thereafter."
5,"Not the usual King, with a heroine that makes you care.","This continues Stephen King's 'new' writing style, with astrong heroine, less horror, and more suspense. I for oneenjoy it. This book goes far beyond ""Gerald's Game"", itactually shows you the terror a beaten wife on the run feelswhen she is first learning her way around the cruel world.This heroine finds help, but her crazed cop-husband isdetermined to hunt her down. I read this book from coverto cover in one evening, and I think you might, too."
4,Excellent non-horror Stephen King book,"Rose Madder is the story of an abused woman, and when toldby Stephen King, it actually becomes more horrifying thansome of his traditional horror stories.Highly recommended."
3,Not quite there..,"Like many of the other reveiwers found, this book started good! But the fantasy ending just didn't quite work. I'm a lover of his fantasy novels (for a real treat, read Insomnia), but this book proved, in the end, to be 150 pages too long. The 'dream' sequence halfway through was wasteful, as it was just repeated 'for real' later, and the book would have been better with just one trip 'through the woods'. Some very good unsettling parts, and the painting being an interesting and encouraging metaphore for Rose was a great idea, but it just went too far, maybe king decided he wanted to play it safe and stick with the tried and tested methods of his usual works? Not as refreshingly new as i thought it would be."
2,A good idea ruined by Stephen King-stupidness.,"In my opinion, the last good novel this guy wrote was Misery. Since trying to stay awake through Insomnia and loathing Regulators, I've decided to give the rest of his novels 100 pages before I decide to trash it or stay with it. Live is just too short to waste time when there are so many far superior authors out there. If I didn't keep getting these Stephen Kings as gifts I probably wouldn't bother at all. On to Rose Madder. I have to admit, by page 80 I was very hooked. Everything went along quite nicely until around page 300, when the patented Stephen King-stupidness kicked in. You know what I mean: the villian starts spewing that gawd-awful baby-talk....""Anna-Anna-bo-Banna, banna-fanna-fo-Fanna"". Give me a break. When is King going to grow up with his readers? He's still writing for 16 year-olds. I'll rate this one a 4 for those over 35. If I had read this at age 16 I would probably have rated it a 9."
1,Rose Madder,I don't think Stephen King wrote this book. It is ridiculously junior high school juvenile. I think a teen aged girl wrote the book for him.
4,a good read,"Stephen King is a writer, one that I enjoy reading almost all he has written. This book is a good one.The plot involves Rosie Daniels who flees from her husband after fourteen years of marriage. She tries to hide from him but as he is a policeman and has good instincts for finding people and is a little crazy may help him find her.It is typical Stephen King. A read good read.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
5,That mask looks ridiculous!,This offering reads like a crime novel with city style violence and pernicious stalking. The primary theme is that of a likeable Rose Madder finding the courage to extricate herself from a marrige gone terribly wrong and finding her true voice. (he experienced an on going horror of sexual abuse when growing up) She is stalked across state lines by her control freak law enforcement husband because he wants to have a private life or death conversation-up close. It's only when he's dead that she finds freedom.
5,An outstanding book!,"Stephen King is finally back in form with ""Rose Madder"". For a span of several years, it appeared that Mr. King was content only to shovel out the same stories only substituting different names for the characters and a different monster for the antagonist. Not anymore. King has come back with a vengeance and given us the scariest ""monster"" to date in the form of psychotic police detective Norman Daniels who relentlessly stalks his runaway wife. Norman Daniels makes Hannibal Lecter look like a boy scout. The book's characters are very well-rounded and the situations are quite believable. If you EVER considered yourself a Stephen King fan, read this book."
3,gripping at first but falls in fantasy toward the end,"i got this book at a used book store near the beach so i could read something while i was working on my tan. it turned out to be surprisingly interesting, taking in the fact that i really don't like stephen king. i couldn't put this book down, but around the part when rose adventures into the painting, i knew i was in for a big disappointment. but all in all, easy reading and a must if your liked ""misery""."
4,"Will not let you eat, work,or rest til done.",How can it be that there are so faucets to any one personality? Stephen king does it (again) with his book Rose Madder. It is an insightful look into the strange twisted world of domestic violence and is perhaps one the best reads I've had in a long time. The pace of the story is what drives the plot so well. It is similar to being trapped in a room with a wild animal: no rest until release comes in the closing of the tale. A very well thought out and well researched book. I'm afraid that Stephen King still has even more sides to his personality that we have yet to witness.
4,Haunting and compelling,"My first King book and am I hooked ! It is a compelling tale about a battered woman who escapes from her cop husband. She finds a picture in a store which fascinates her, puts it up in her apartment....and her life changes.The world beyond the picture is as real and as warped as a mirror image, there are a lot of similarities and it seems as though it is her own life standing on its head. Then her husband finds her and she has to return to this warped world to destroy him.Its a story crafted to haunt, to linger. I personally feel this is one of his best books."
4,GREAT! Rosie stayed with me after I finished the book!!!,"not since GERALD'S GAME have I felt compelled to get in the pages and help the charactors. SK's development of Rosie is so indepth that I felt every high and low, every kidney punch and even the lonliness of the bus ride as if I were Rosie.One of King's best efforts-couldn't put it down!!!"
2,Ze Bool,"I regard this work by Stephen King as one of the weirdest. This book is like a first draft, a sketch. Snip: (...)"
1,Excuse me. What is this?,"To paraphrase Homer Simpson: Boooooooooring!! Jesus H. Christ! Makes you wonder what the Hell is King taking us for. Are we Constant Readers, or are we Absolute Idiots to buy this kind of thing?? Not that it doesn't have it's good part here or there, I am not saying that, but I'll say this: King becoming moralistic?? Writing about ""real life dramas of wives being beaten""??? Ooooh come on Mr. King! We are tired of being cheated out anymore! Do us a favour and re-write the good old stuff. Who knows, re-read Pet Sematary or The Shining and get your cogs oiled."
1,This book is unreadable!!!!!!!!!!!,"I can't believe I forced myself to finish this garbage. All of the characters are either hackneyed or predictable or stale! The dialogue is awful ""and that's a fact, Jack!"" Who talks like this. I didn't care about anyone, and King should have cut the Bull.King has fallen far from such tasty stories as ""The Shining"", ""The Dead Zone"", and my personal favorite ""The Long Walk"". Instead of writing thrilling material, King has turned into a hack! (Which is all most of his baddies seem to do!)"
4,Always thrills me,"Stephen King never disappoints me! Here he shows off his versatility in being able to write from the perspective of a female character. Very thrilling, and very different! Loved it!"
3,Interesting?,"It was a good book that captured my interest, but I found the ending confusing and bizarre."
1,GREEK MYTHOLOGY AT ITS WORST!!!!!,"Why does Mr King get involved into areas unknown to him? As a Greek reader I am offended by his latest works, especially Rose Madder and Insomnia, where Greek mythology undergoes a Hercules and Xena rendition! Please spare us your miniscule education on foreign matters, Mr King... and stick to American horror. Obviously getting involved with ancient civilisations is too much for you. I am offended, to say theleast... and so is Minotaur, Klotho, Lachesis and Atropos!"
5,Mesmerizing Madder,"A single drop of blood changes the life of an emotionally and a physically battered woman from the throes of an unrealistic life into a new world of vision.Only...hope comes from the realm of turbulent dreams - through the most unusual painting she discovers while she's busy coming in terms with her freedom.But sooner or later, whether you want it or not, past knocks on your door seeking your blood.What do you do? How do you face it?This King novel explores the plethora of misery and independence through a woman's plight to gain recognition for herself.Rose Madder is strength."
4,one of the best king books outside the dark tower series,Rose Madder is hands down one of King's finest novels. The trials of Rose McClendon and the scent into madness of her husband Norman make for a fine readthe translation from printed word to digital left me crying in the cormer. every single time the word 'corner' is used it instead shows 'cormer'. if you don't let that bother you then this book is indeed a great work of literature
2,Standard Stephen King Fare Poorly Edited,"It's not my favorite Stephen King book by a long shot. I had a hard time believing the story line.But, all that aside, whoever converted this book from its paper version to the e-book version did a terrible job. Most times when the letters 'r' and 'n' are found together, such as in the word ""corner"", they are replaced with the letter 'm', making the word ""comer"". At first I thought it was just the font being used that made me see it that way, but then I found an instance where they got it right and used the 'r' and the 'n' as they should.A lot of this book is intended to be in italics to identify whose perspective we're reading. There are many places where the italics are not consistent. Lots of other cases of poor spacing and poor editing of the e-book version, which detract from the natural flow of the book, and distracts the reader. I'm really very surprised to see that they're asking $8.99 for something that is so poorly done. It should be free."
2,One of my least favorite King stories...,"As an avid King reader, I read them ALL, the reviews be damned! However, I am in a position to read/listen to all I want. Therfore, if you want to save yourself a few bucks, you can skip this one all together. Maybe I just don't get it but the story seems fractured and put together with scotch tape. I didn't find it scary or even interesting. But hey...someone thought enough to make it into a TV movie, so...maybe somewhere, someone is saying to me, ""How can you be so obtuse?"""
4,To Those Who Don't Like This Book:,".... All in all this is a good book, although the thing with Norman's rubber bull's mask was a little stupid, appeared to be to me at least, but the story about Rose, who her character unfolds during the development of the novel, who she enters the mystical world of Rose Madder - that's great, really great. In my eyes this is a very classic Stephen King, very classic writing, very classic elements of story, but on the other hand it is not. It is a wonderful story of love, lost, and pain, a story that has its own mythology, its own pace and most of all a character made out of flesh and blood, not of ink and paper. Rose is a woman you can see, hear, feel, touch ... she is as true, as this story is - because it is true to the most important thing about a book: the story itself."
2,Ruined by a horrible ending!,"I was really enjoying this book and was looking forward to the denouement, when King drops this absolute schlock on my head. How awful! And it's not like he couldn't do better.I've read most of his books, and I guess I just expected more. Up until the end, this was at least a four-star read (probably five), but I'm very picky about endings and this was just the pits!"
3,"""Sleeping With the Enemy"" - without Julia Roberts","If you have seen the movie ""Sleeping with the Enemy"", it is hard not to feel like you are reading the screenplay for the first half of the book: of course you know the abusive husband will eventually find our heroine, who has fled New England by bus to hide in the Midwest, and the only real suspense is what will happen after he finally does.The parts inside the painting get ridiculously drawn-out and sybmolic. In this respect, it is a lot like Insomnia, stepping too far out of the believable scenario he starts with, and into religious/mythological fantasy worlds.Not a bad book overall, but as usual with his recent novels, a disappointing finish after a strong start"
3,Could Have Been Better,"This book was good but certainly not great. There were moments and potential for greatness, but it never quite reached that crescendo. There was a long dream sequence that I found confusing and actually boring. It was when he stuck to his basic stalker theme that the book was at its best. Interesting read, could have/should have been better."
4,Another #1 Best Seller,"Rose Madder is another one of King's best novels. Everyone has heard of someone in an abusive relationship, but King shows how frightening it can be. King uses very vivid descriptions to show how abusive some people can get. When the wife decides it must stop, things get worse.What would you do if you had a cop that would rather see you dead as to look at you? I recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense and action. This book is loaded with action from the start. Few authors could make so many number one best sellers but King has done it. This was a great action packed book."
3,Better than Gerald's Game,"Rose Madder is the second Stephen King book that I have read, with Gerald's Game being the first. I liked Rose Madder. It had a haunting beginning, a somewhat dragged-out middle, and an appropriate ending. The worst part of Rose Madder involved the whole painting scenario. If that part of the book had not existed, I would have given this book an extra star. The villain in this book became more and more insane, but I still found him to be very interesting. When comparing Rose Madder to Gerald's Game, for some reason I cared more about Rosie McClendon than I did for Jesse. I guess Rosie had more depth to her (JMO). Rose Madder certainly had its flaws, but I would and do recommend this book, especially to first time Stephen King readers."
2,viva ze bool,"i thought it was a great book until it turned into fantasy. too drastic a switch, in my opinion, because the book was so believable."
2,"Not bad material, but clearly not up to Mr. King's standards","Like many readers of Stephen's novels, I am disappointed he has taken an opportunists' approach to writing about 'social causes' for the sake of expanding his financial worth. I would rather he complete unfinished works than focus on these dime a dozen diatribes that I would classify with romance novels"
2,barely readable from a genius author,kings strength has always beens characterization but in this over wrought novel i found myself caring little for the protagonist and being annoyed rather than disturbed by the antagonist. predictable and surprisingly uninventive. sorry to say. just read geralds game instead.
3,"Ok, but ....","I enjoy Stephen King on the whole, but does anybody else get tired of all of the descriptions? It takes a chapter of adjectives to describe how Rose felt about something. Also, PLEASE, no music, it was very painful. Everytime Rose's chapters would begin or end I had to put the volume down A LOT to get past it. Norman's chapters weren't bad, but the pitch was lower. Rose's were so high pitched, I'm surprised dogs didn't run away howling."
3,Interesting!,"It has been awhile since I have read anything by Stephen King, but the title of the book made me curious. Well, after reading ""Rose Madder,"" I have come to the conclusion that this wasn't one of his better books (nothing can top MISERY), but overall, it wasn't too bad of a read. Enjoy!"
3,King Takes a Different Approach,"In writing about domestic violence, King takes a turn from most of his other novels. This book is engaging, but somewhat of a dissapointment. It can get confusing, and, yes, frustrating to read. It is worth the read, though, because of the beautiful way King writes, and how vividly Norman, the abuser, is portrayed."
5,My favorite from King!,"Rose Daniels is a frightened, abused creepmouse of a woman living with her abusive cop husband, Norman. He's spanked her, bit her, cut her, threatened to kill her, raped her, and he even beat her baby girl out of her one night. Nevertheless she stays with him until fourteen years later she realizes she has to run away while he's at work. Just leave. Fast. She steals his bank card and takes a train to a city hundreds of miles away where she begins to rebuild and repair her life. But Norman is searching for her. Norman is furious. And he's determined to make her pay. My favorite Stephen King book, next to Pet Sematary and Misery. Don't miss it, but feel free to miss Carrie, that one stunk."
1,Awful Ending,Any realistic book that ends with a character jumping into a picture is not one that I want to read! Enough said!
2,zzzzz in the end,"This book started out great, and honestly I would have preferred if king had not attempted to make this a paranormal ""thriller"" the highlights of the book are the parts that do not include anything ""out of the ordinary"" the ending was downright horrible and lacked any kind of reasoning and motivation. I'm kinda sad I wasted my time reading this book rather then another."
1,Torturously bad,"I've enjoyed other King books (The Shining, Gerald's Game) but Rose Madder is, well, terrible. With *two* lethally boring ""dream sequences"" that inexplicably go on for dozens of pages, numbing you until you start begging aloud for them to end. Like others who've reviewed the book here, I found myself reduced to skimming these sections.My other problem with the book is the excessive and equally numbing vileness of the wife-abuser Norman. King seems to relish, in some weird self-indulgent way, his chance to embody this repellant character. It's all overwritten. When one vile, mysognist fantasy would do, we're treated to fifteen. Reading Norman's thoughts is like being forced to endure rancid, neo-nazi heavy metal music.Avoid this book."
3,Great premise which got wasted,This book started out great but lost the intrigue for me. It has a great premise. How do you start a new life when your abusive husband is a respected cop and police resources at his finger tips?But Norman gets on Rose's tail with really very little effort and then violently kills and mutilates everyone in his path.This book could have been so much better.
5,Merauder rulez,"It's a very cool album, but its not as good as the first one. Still I would like to rate it with five stars, because it rocks. By the way... I don't agree with this album being a deathmetal-album, I think its metalcore! But it still rulez"
4,deadly,"an excellent album for fans of the aggro metal styles of such bands as pissing razors, and pantera, yet wholly original within the genre, check it out its worth it"
3,PILATES RING,RING IS AN EASY RESITANCE RING-AS ADVERTISED. PADDED GRIPS ARE FINE FOR HANDS--BUT NOT QUITE SOFT ENOUGH FOR FEET OR OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY.
2,One Point of Not-So-Trivia,"One point the reviews of this comic seem to have missed, or avoided, is that the author Karl Zinsmeister is in fact Domestic Policy Advisor to one George W. Bush. Take it as you wish -- interesting factoid or evidence of bias. But it should be disclosed."
3,"A great idea, but a tepid read","I anxiously awaited the release of Combat Zone from the time it was announced as a mini-series from Marvel. Having enmeshed myself in historically based comics, I was eager to see how a true to life event would be treated. After waiting, and paying for the bound five part series, I was left with mixed feelings. Mr. Zinsmeister has attempted to collect his experiences from Boots on the Ground, but it was a bit flat. I found myself wanting something that the comic wasn't offering. It is too bad.Was it worth the wait? Yes and no. From a teaching standpoint, it would draw people (especially younger readers) in, and could serve as a springboard for further discussion. For a comic that has a more emotional kick, I would suggest that one try to obtain a copy of Joe Sacco's vignette Complacency Kills, which was featured in the Guardian."
3,Moments of fun,"This is a pretty cool toy really. It takes about 10-15 tries to really figure out how to get the appropriate bubble effect. Unfortunately, unless you are a stockholder in magic bubbles, you may not have stockpiled enough soap to get to that point. Once you do, there is relief that you've figured it out and it's cool. It's been back in the box since."
5,Steve Madge delivers again,Maybe i'm a little biased but this is a great book.However trying to find a copy was something of a wild goose chase
4,"Entertaining, great sources","The author put together a wide variety of primary sources, some commonly featured in other books on the subject and some I have not seen anywhere else. She did a good job picking readings that give a glimpse of the real people and how they lived, rather than the stilted, emotionless things I'm used to in medieval writings."
3,Not convinced,"First off, make no mistake about it... the stuff holds together very nicely. My experience with the product is that both sides were very secure together. HOWEVER, the adhesive used did not work all that well on drywall (hanging foam diffusers weighing less than 4 lbs each) and about 20% of them did not hold for more than a few weeks at best.The interesting thing was that the hook/loop held without trouble (and from personal experience while mounting, it's VERY strong). However, the adhesive used to secure the hook and loop portions doesn't work as well on drywall it seems."
2,Velcro review,The original velcro that keeps the taneau cover on my truck wore out. It would not stick anymore. It was about 8 years old.I replaced it with the 2 in x 15 foot industrial strength Velcro.It worked for a couple years but then peeled off. The gum off the back of the velcro stayed on my truck railing. It was a pain to get the gum off my metal side railing. I took a couple hours with a razor blade scraper and some Goof-off.I need to find a better quality velcro. The gum sticks real good but does not stick to the back of the velcro very well.
2,Doesn't stick to fabric,"I got this velcro because my couch cushions move around a lot. I thought I would attach one side to the couch base, the other side to the cushion, affix the velcro, and I'd be set. Well, the velcro sticks to itself very well. It just doesn't stick to the polyester fabric of my couch at all. Very frustrating. Of course it does say on the box in rather small print (although I could not find this mentioned anywhere in the description of the product) that it doesn't work on fabric. This is correct. It doesn't."
4,It's velcro. It's useful.,"I can't imagine a world without velcro. Seems a bit expensive for what it is, but I mean, come on already."
3,"Industrial Strength, but not waterproof","Okay, I had some fairly specific requirements. We used the velcro with some fabric to make a bit of a skirt for our bathroom sink. Nothing fancy - just something to hide the pipes underneath. After about a month, the adhesiveness of the sticky back diminished significantly. This matches up with the hook-and-loop fasteners we used for the previous skirt. The solution was the same, too: a couple strategic drops of super glue, and it will hold until we're ready to remove it.The hook-and-loop part is robust, though. If you're looking for a large and strong bit of Velcro for your non-water-resistant needs, I'm sure this will be more than sufficient."
5,Great product,"In the fall we used this to put up plastic over our garage doors, using the door frame. It has stood up to driving rain, 40 mph gusts, 10 degree temps and hasn't budged. We will see how it does over the summer."
3,Not as sticky as I had hoped,"I bought this because an item I have mounted on my dashboard kept ""losing the sticky"" and falling off. While this lasts longer than that did, I had anticipated a significantly better level of adhesion. In reality, it is only slightly better. While not a total disappointment, it was not as ""industrial strength"" as I had hoped it would be. On the positive side, you do get a lot of it for the money."
3,Good Velcro but product quality is not the same.,I have a box of this Velcro that I purchased about two years ago. The box is blue and the quality of the Velcro is amazing. I purchased a new box recently and the quality of this product is nothing like it used to be. I will have to use the old box much more sparingly because apparently the quality of this product has gone downhill.
2,becomes unglued in cold weather,So difficult to separate the velcro itself but the adhesive falls off with no effort during below freezing temps despite adhering it to a clean surface.
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I bought this velcro tape with a bit of skepticism as to where the `industrial strength' moto will hold, as we were hanging very big and heavy banners at our company stand in a fair. But, it was true to word, the tape can really be considered `industrial strength' and if the need comes to remove it altogether it is also possible with some work and patience, leaves no traces behind (although we did not left it in the panels more than a week). The only con was the dispenser, did not find it as practical as it could have been."
1,Poor quality velcro,"I bought this with the intention to use it to hold a shop ""curtain"" to one wall. This crap will not even stick to the wall. Absolutely useless. Do NOT waste your money on this junk!"
5,"Before Texas, there was only a River.","I don't actually own this EP, but I do own the original Riverfenix recording, before they had to change their name. Besides that I do happen to know that ""G.B.O.H"" and ""Minimum Wage"" are probably the two best POP-punk songs I have ever heard; and ""Skinhead Jessie"" is a great ska song too. Perfect Pop Punk."
1,Why Country Music Has a Bad Name,"This is the sort of wan, watered-down pap that gives country a bad name. Somehow, they even managed to find a bad Dwight Yoakam song! These songs are mawkish, generic and oh-so-bland, adhering to all the modern pseudo-Country cliches in ultra-hokey fashion. And they all sound alike."
2,Just a comment,"I haven't read the book but I am about to buy it so this isn't a review it's just a comment on the other reviews.I don't know exactly how the writing linked Taoism and Ninjutsu as I haven't read the book. I just wanted to say this isn't the first time I have heard of this.It was in one of either of these two books I can't remember which (I would bet on the first):Mind ManipulationThe Ninja - Steven HayesThey discuss the development of alot of the psychoogical aspects from the Taoist 5 elements and there was a reference to some ""5 element ninjas."" There was even a Japanese word for them.I remember this clearly coz at the time I was doing XIng Yi Luihe a Taoist art with the 5 elements at its heart. Also the 5 element ninja idea sounded cool.I am not concluding anything...just offering a bit of info in passing.PS. My rating was just to try and not mess up the rating by others."
3,Shipping WAY TOO HIGH,"The shipping was over twice the price of the item. It would have worked if the batteries that arrived with it had been good. Needless to say, I had to purchase new batteries.After I bought this, I found the same thing at Wal-Mart. Good batteries and no shipping charge. Wish I would have seen it at Walmart first."
5,Is It For Real? Graetel Wants to Know,"I love it, but my fourteen year-old cat is still considering its value! Of course, she has an attitude about most everything!"
4,Cat definitely has fun with this toy!,"My cat (a 6 year old female calico) definitely likes this toy. She even plans with it when the light is off - if I leave it on the counter top within her reach, I'll soon not be able to locate it the next time I try to find it. So far, it works well. But remember to play with your cat with tangible items after playing with this, since cats can never really ""catch"" the laser. Some cats can get quite frustrated with this, so it's good to play with another toy after this to fulfill that need to chase and actually catch something."
5,Great! Easy to Hold!,"I needed a new laser pointer for my cat and purchased the Zanies Laser Beam based on the reviews and it works great!The laser light is bright and bold. It is also easy to grip which is actually a huge positive for me because I have carpel and cubital tunnel syndrom in both my arms/hands. The shape of it reduces the amount of grip I need to supply when playing with my cat, Misty. I have used it pretty regularly for 2 1/2 months now and have not had to replace the battery yet.The price is pretty comparable to other laser pointers, perhaps a few dollars more than some. Based on my use of this product so far, it is worth the few extra dollars."
3,Works and is relatively cheap. But beam is not as sharp or bright as some.,"Doesn't work as well as a cheap business pointer that I have, but it's ok. Works well on wood floors, but on a dark carpet, my cat loses it when twirling at CATastrophic speeds:) At a distance it's a bit large and fuzzy as well. So, overall average."
2,Small Laser,The laser beam on this is very small. It makes it hard to see unless your room is very dark. The Kong laser (it's red) has a much thicker and bigger laser beam that you can use anywhere.
5,My cats and dogs love it!,"My cats and even the dogs love this toy. I used it for a few hours the other night and I was glad to see the batteries going strong (batteries are included).I wish it took a AAA or a AA battery as those are cheaper, but this toy was still great! Highly recommend for cats and/or dogs!!!"
1,Stopped working within 2 mins,"It was a gift, so when it stopped working within a couple minutes of use, I was that much more upset."
5,Cat Pleaser,"Our old laser light was growing dim, so I decided to replace it with the Laser Beam Mouse. Every morning now when my husband is picking up his keys, wallet, etc. for work, our cat stealthily makes his way up to him waiting for the laser show. The laser beam is bright and larger than the old one, so the cat has less difficulty tracking it. He'll chase it up the stairs and all over the house. I find the mouse shape easy and comfortable to hold."
4,Nice. Works well. Uses the small button batteries,"I bought this because a different laser toy konked out and I had a lot of extra batteries that I did not want to go to waste. Otherwise I would have purchased one that uses AAA batteries.Having said that, this toy is what it is advertised to be - a small plastic red laser cat toy shaped like a mouse that works great!"
5,Really the brightest laser toy we've bought!,"This really is the brightest laser toy we have purchased, and we have purchased several. This one shows up in the daytime as well as at night. Fun for interactive play with the pets. My cats and dogs love it!"
5,Cute Cat Toy,"I got this as a joke for my wife, but she and the cat love it. It came on time and so far it is a hoot to play with. We have had the cat bring it to us so he can play. I have never seen the cat move so fast and jump so high. If you have a cat, you have to have one of these.."
1,Cheap / Defective,"Right out of the packaging this was busted. The on/off button didn't work so once the batteries were in, the laser pointer was perpetually on. The batteries therefore died really quickly. Most other reviews seem positive so maybe the one I got was a rare defective product. Unfortunately for my cat, who loved it, I am returning it."
3,"Consider other, cheaper lasers","When I adopted two kittens a few months ago, I decided to stock up on new toys. As expected, they loved this laser. However, I recently read an article that suggested lasers can be ""mean"" for cats. It explained that the laser teases cats too much because they get frustrated when they can't catch the light. That may be an overreaction and a symptom of a worrywart kitty parent, but I think it has some validity.In any case, I think this particular laser is overpriced. I had no problems with mine, but you can find it for half the price at Target or Walmart, and there are also cheaper options here at Amazon."
3,OVER PRICED,CHEAPER AT TARGET only $2.99 overpriced - This item has available for much cheaper at the target store. I was so surprised.
2,Laser Beam Mouse,Cat toy was enjoyed for two days by my cat now must find replacement batteries will become costly if batteries only last a couple of days but it was fun to watch the cat chase the laser
5,Super Sax,"I saw Paul Taylor at a Jazz Festival in Columbia, Md. in June '98. I immediately bought his C.D. ""Pleasure Seeker"". I've waited a year and a half for Paul's next C.D. It was worth the wait! ""Undercover"" contains some of the smoothest sax music you can find. Keep the great music flowing Paul!"
2,The CD wrapping was tighter than this CD,"Obviously Paul Taylor didn't show Jeff Kaz his walking papers from the Rippingtons because he was the better player. Taylor in this effort is uninspired and obviously everyone who reviewed this CD won Paul Taylor concert tickets at some point. As I listened to this and based on the other reviews Kenny G's voice was heard and not Taylor's. This CD as a lot of sax-based CD's we purchase was just holding us over until something new by Boney James, Gerald Albright or Kirk Whalum comes out...."
4,Finally! A Great Debut CD!,I don't have too high of expections for a debut cd but I was amazed by how great this cd is. Steve Holy will definately make a name for himself in country music.It seemed like forever for his album to be release but it was well worth the wait. Every track on this album has such feeling.
5,Awesome song writing,Every song is a winner . I love his voice. This purchase was a good one without a doubt. Ty
3,disapointed,this cd of steve's was not very good the songs were all to slow and draggy. i only played it one time i didn'tlike it at all.bobbie lawson
5,Welcome To A New Breed of Singers,"Ever Get that feeling that a superstar has just hit us? Well, that is the feeling that I felt the First time I heard Don't Make Me Beg. I purchased the single and anxiously awaited the release of the CD. It Was Finally released in October 2000, nearly a year after I first heard ""don't."" It was well worth the Wait. Much Like His Contemporary Eric Heatherly, Steve sings songs he likes, not just ones the ever fickle radio will like. The 2nd single, ""Blue Moon,"" Is a great tune to sing along to. ""The Hunger"" is a potential breakout single. ""one Beat at a time"" is a great song. ""Just a Kiss"" sounds as if it's right off an Orbison record. ""Good Morning Beautiful"" has great wordplay with the lyrics. ""You're Gonna Miss My Love,"" written by Pure Prarie League's Craig Fuller, is pure southern rock at it's finest. Get this record you won't be let down."
3,Solid and serious fantasy novel - 3.5 stars out of 5,"This book was much more complex than I expected from a Magic:The Gathering tie-in. I bought it because of the author, and I was not disappointed. It has many good elements, although one or two of them did not sit as well with me as the others. The book has a very strong start, intriguingly presenting numerous characters in diverse settings, then slowly tying them all together. Most of these characters I found fascinating. A bit of the middle of the book got a little slow on one of the plot threads, but the ending was pretty strong. Well worth checking out. I greatly enjoyed a scientist/scholar character - unusual for a fantasy novel! The quest for a lost city scenario was really cool!"
2,Not Exactly the greatest book ever written...,"... though i HAVE read worse. The author makes the same mistake many post-rerelease Star Wars authors do; he goes out of his way to put the source material into the book. Many of the references to M:TG cards are nothing more then that, references to cards. They don't integrate into the story too well. This really hurt the books impact on me, because every once in awhile there'd be some stupid pointless reference that had no reason to be there except to be a reference. I myself LOVE the game, but this book just doesn't cut it for me. The first ""trilogy"" (Whispering Woods, Shattered Chains and Final Sacrifice) was much better."
5,A Wonderful Read as well as Instructional Work,"The reviewer entitled ""hk537"" must live on a different planet, (or maybe just jealous and insecure). Not only is McRaven's knowledge of building and construction with both stone and wood exemplary, but in addition, he adds his own touches of humor in the manner of old yarn storytelling. He also includes a large amount of historical information which I found to be endlessly fascinating. If someone were looking for an instructional book with ""just the hard facts"", be aware that this author's books go way beyond that. A wonderful, educational, and enjoyable read!"
4,Fantastic book,"This is an amazing collection of tips, tricks, and instructions for a log builder. The only disappointment in the entire book was the section on hewing. There weren't many pictures and I can see where new log builders would have trouble catching on.Then again, I'm a hewing addict who loves learning every nuance and variation on basic methods, so perhaps the problem is with me expecting too much. At any rate, every hewn-log builder should buy this book. Mr. McRaven is one of the foremost log buildings in North America, and the chapter on chinking alone is worth the cover price."
2,Don't waste your money!!,"This book is a poor attempt. I've read pamphlets with more usable information in them. The section on Hewing is a joke, as is most all the rest of this book. Very few hints and techniques in this book, which was very disappointing. Lots of self pumping-up, not no real instruction detail. Stick to writing books about stone, Mr. McRaven and give the timber world a sigh of relief."
5,Locked Room Puzzle,"Carter Dickson (John Dickson Carr) THE RED WIDOW MURDERS is a classic from the Golden Age of Mysteries. Sir Henry Merrivale is asked to join a group to test a room where since 1825 anyone who spent two hours was found dead before the house is torn down.Drawing cards a young man pulls the high card. He enters the room and at intervals responds to a hale from the others who are in the dinning room. Expecting to find the curse broken when they enter the room -- their glee is destroyed when they discover the young man is dead. He has been for some time and this begins one of Sir Henry's most complex cases where a killer may win in the battle of wits.A fine read for any age.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
1,Low Quality Mat,"I barely bought this mat a few weeks ago and it is ripped in several places. I only use it for pilates and yoga. I did not expect such an expensive mat to tear so easily. When not in use, I roll it up and store it under my bed. Such a poor quality mat, I am very unhappy with this purchase. Please do not make the same mistake I did. The REEBOK Mat that I had for the last seven years still looks brand new with no tears. I gave that mat to my husband to use and I bought this one for myself. I am soooo diappointed. This mat is rated zero stars."
2,"nice, but no handle",the mat is fine for pilates.No handle or strap to tie together makes it hard to carry.returned to buy one with a handle.
1,"Too many assumptions, opinions.","This is not an objective, scientific work. It does not compare like to like. It says there is no ""economy"" even though trade is widely practiced."
5,A vivacious recording!,"When the recording of instrumental music is done right, the ""feel"" of the piece and the period is transmitted from the musician to the listener effortlessly. This disk demonstrates that phenomenon in an outstanding way -- you can sense the energy of the music as interpreted by the musicians playing it. Even the most ""largo"" of the pieces has an edge. The brightness of the Renaissance has been woven into every note.Maybe it's the period instruments or maybe they're just damn good players -- but I can't get enough of this CD.(great for trips in the car, background music at dinner, relaxing in the bathtub, doing work on the computer, etc.)"
1,Save your money,"Don't get me wrong -- this is a great product; however, $27.97 for shipping from Amazom or $7.95 shipping from Office Depot. Whatsup with that? Is Amazon tacking on a $20 handling fee? I ordered directly from Office Depot and now it makes me wonder how many of my other purchases from Amazon were the same."
3,Intentionally bad and it succeeds,"If you're looking for tons of skin and gore, you shouldn't have any problem in your journey and I wish you well. Peace be to ye. If you're looking for bad 80's rap, bad 80's synth music, jr high humor, blatant but not too harsh stereotypes, if you ever wanted to know what kind of things the people who made ABC After School Specials worked on after they snapped...why not? You should be able to find a few clips on youtube to give you an idea.Again, not much skin or gore in this. I've seen it listed as 'grindhouse.' Not true. Strictly Comedy/Musical with small amounts of skin and blood done in attempts at humor."
1,"Wretched, Painful to Watch","It was torture to watch this movie.The cast and crew deserve congratulations for doing a lot with very little,but the result is not so bad that its good-it is simply bad.The charectors are all maddening-I've never been so happy to see people die.The songs are better than you'd expect but they can't save this.There's a galaxy of difference between an unintentially bad movie like ""Glen or Glenda"" and a calculated,deliberately awful movie like this.Luckily for Amazon I'm too embarrassed about buying this tape to demand my money back."
2,funny as hell,"well i went to the video shop and didn't know what else to get,so i decided to get this out,when i watched it i full on laughed,neally peed my pants......kiddin,check this movie out."
1,Below one star,"As a good aficionado to horror movies, I bought this movie since the title called my attention. It was a real torture to watch it. Movie is an art and this film is simply disgusting, vulgar, confectioned with a particularly refined bad taste, a waste of time and money."
5,This is a great movie!,One of my friends brought this video over and we had a ball watching it! It's such a great movie... the songs are great as well as the production I'd reccomend it to anyone
4,Very good quality for a good price,I am satisfied wih both the product and the delivery time. I would order it again.
3,Not overwhelmed,"The color I chose was Bamboo...a little hard to determine on-line what it would look like, but guess I lucked out because the color was perfect.I can't say that this foundation is any different from an over-the-counter foundation. I have extremely dry skin, and have yet to find a foundation that really hydrates and reduces the appearance of wrinkles.It's okay, but again, nothing to write home about."
3,Very nice boot!,I was very excited to try the shoes on when I got them but soon realized right is larger then the left one. On the bottom of the shoe it said size 6 1/2 on both but when you look on the inside right was a 7 and left was a 6 1/2. Otherwise the color (Taupe)and the made is beautiful.
1,Absolutely Dreadful Mix of Opera & Pop,"In searching for crossover between opera & pop ,I own all of these CD's by title or artists: Aria 1 & 2 , Operatica 1 & 2 , Sasha Lazard , Stephanie Lien , Emma Shapplin , Sarah Brightman . Trance Opera's "" Fantasies "" was my most recent purchase & by far the worst crossover opera ever !! Even Amici Forever the Opera Band are better - at least their beats are in sync with the music . A waste of money since I couldn't stand any of the songs . I figure I could do a better job than Trance Opera in mixing opera aria tracks with pop / trance after listening to all the other worthwhile CD's above ."
5,Perfect Fit!,"I had a special job that required a zero clearance insert. I have a very old (but very good condition) vintage Craftsman ""100"" table saw. This particular insert was the only one I could find on line. Perfect fit! Very easy to follow instructions, and very durable. I highly recommend this item to anyone."
4,Back to the Future,"This CD kept bringing back (fond) memories of the late 60's and early 70's,(Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix, maybe even Blue Cheer) though the sound is definitely that of Chris Duarte. I was reminded of his live performances...a little rough around the edges, but the soul of the music comes through; raw and from the gut, not slicked up or stifled by over-production. The songs seem to get better with each listen. I'd recommend this for anyone who likes bare-bones, heavy, guitar-driven rock with intelligent composition and playing. Having talked with him at a live show, I can attest to Duarte's refreshing humility; this CD attests to his extraordinary musicianship. Buy it!"
4,Excellent guitar work,"This is my first Chris Duarte CD and I like it a lot. His guitar work rips and his voice is sufficient. He knows when to be quiet and let the music do the talking. I really liked the homages to Hendrix and SRV. I haven't had it long, but will enjoy it more and more. If you like Jake Andrews, Walter Trout, Indigenous, etc., then you will enjoy this CD."
2,High Hopes Dashed,"Yet another disappointing release from CD. I really wanted this one to be good. This isn't blues by any stretch of the imagination. It is a rock album, but not much of one at that. ""Free 4 Me"" is ok as is the only one that can be considered blues ""How Long."" I really love Chris' first release, but something really bad must have happened in this guys life 'cause this disc is nothing more than one man's cathartic mess. I sure hope he gets it together some day because I really believe he has a lot of talent. If you are looking for the same brilliance found on ""Texas Sugar..."" pass on this one."
1,how disappointing,"Chris is a great guitar player. His previous albums were full of sparkling funky rhythms and solo playing. He knew how to play blues. This album lacks of originality, it's not very bluesy. Most of the tunes are hard to listen to all the way through. I am very disappointed. Where is Texas blues going to?"
3,Duarte Victim of Hard Times,"When Chris Duarte released his debut album, ""Texas Sugar, Strat Magic,"" it felt as if the void left by the passing of Stevie Ray Vaughan just might be filled. Duarte's follow up album, ""Tailspin Headwhack"" took the listener in another more experimental, Hendrix influenced direction. This alienated Duarte's hardcore blues audience, sales suffered, and the band scrambled for a record deal. ""Love is Greater Than Me"" is the result. Instead of using his struggles as inspiration to reach new heights, Duarte recycles themes and riffs from previous albums in a much less inspirational way. Production is not as crisp as previous efforts, and soul is sorely lacking. The fact that Chris Duarte is an amazing talent makes this album worth buying, but this album will disappoint fans."
5,The definitive Didon,Such a pity the Met never mounted Les Troyen for La Crespin or that EMI didnt record the complete opera with her because her interpretation is definitive. So we have to be grateful that EMI has at least re-issued this recording and that Is is once again available to enjoy.
5,This CD is Bangin' !!,"Supa Geto Tight. Chopped up, Mixed down, And Srcewed...Can it get any better? Only if they release a Part 2. This CD has all the hits of the south, east, north, and west. This CD is off the chain. Even if you don't like screw like I do you will be able to enjoy the DJin' techs. of who ever mix this one. Pick this one UP!!!!!!"
4,Inclusion-Body Myositis - technical but useful,"One of the very few publications for this very rare condition. I found it useful but very technical and granular. I had to force myself through the more technical sections, but found enough useful to assist in helping a friend. I certainly encourage readers to obtain this reference book even though it is pricey and tough reading. It is one of the very few tittles on the subject. My health care contacts at Stanford Medical, and Queens Hospital in Hawaii found it useful. One thing there is not. There is no cure, and no recognized treatment prescribed. I look forward to that day."
4,good show,"This was a great show from the x men . The action was good , and juggernaut had funny punchlines . It feature the rare x men colassoes ,sorry if I spelled it wrong . What was good about the episode was it was on its own . Meaning you don't have to buy the previeous one to catch up on it .Great show . Also except jesus as your lord savior . Take care"
4,One of the best X-men episodes! Awesome.,"One of the things in this installment I like most is the way the plot is drawn out for us. 9/10 of the X-men blame a steel-skinned mutant Collossus for the destruction of the X-mansion. The X-men battle Collossus while Wolverine, one of the first X-men, battles the guilty one: Juggernaut. The plot is more detailed and complex than this but I won't elaborate further. You'll have to see it yourself. But the thing I don't like about it was the way they described the Juggernaut. I think he needs more detail on the whereabouts of him and should've described more about his half-brother relationship with... But overall, I would reccomend it highly."
4,Atmospheric and contemplative......,"Quick runs and delicate melodies. Interesting moods. This is perfect music for meditation! This album evokes the spirit and beauty of the Adirondack Mountains that obviously the composer so dearly loves. The musical styles are as diverse as Native American and ""new age"". Frederic Chopin and Franz Liszt are everywhere in the piano compositions in this CD. Atmospheric and contemplative. Great structuring! Technically flawless! Not enough info in the liner notes, so 4 stars; otherwise five for sure."
2,Come on John What's This,"I'm Sorry But. I Started listening to John when he first came out. ""Lifes a Dance"" ""I Love the Way You Love Me"" I saw him up close ""10 feet"" in small clubs before anybody new who he was. I was crazy about him. First three albums that is. Ever since then he has not had the original magic and if he thinks he is brand new I have awful bad news for him. He needs to get a brand new life besides music. There is nothing new here and very boring indeed. Even the so called smash hit ""Little Girl"" Sure I cried the first time I heard it. It has a good message that needs to be heard. But I could listen to this song 10 times max. As far as a hit with staying power give me a break. It is a very depressing song. Sure it has truths to it that society should address. But not on my stereo. Like I said 10 times maybe. Then hang it up. I know he felt strong about it but he should make better choices of what he wants to record if he wants to keep his old fans like me."
2,"Full price was worth the song THAT LITTLE GIRL but,","I believe that I am a pretty good judge of music and I appreciate all types. But I was really diappointed when I listened to the full CD. If this represents his BRAND NEW ME then Michael needs to return to his former self. I have yet to listen to anything else than THE LITTLE GIRL track. The rest of the CD had no impact on me. Sorry but, this CD really made me think about all the junk we have to pay for to get to the one most inspiring song. I wish artists would consider what they are putting out to the public, even if they know that one song can carry the album."
4,even then is a great song,the album overall isnt the greatest but it is good the song even then is just about the best song i ever heard so id recommend this album to anyone
5,Contains THE Best Love Song I've Ever Heard,"The rave on this CD is all about #8 ""The Little Girl"". True it is one of the top hits this year, but song #5, ""Even Then"", is the best song on this record. If you liked ""I Love the Way you Love Me"", ""I Swear"" and ""I Can Love you Like That"", then you are going to love ""Even Then.""This is the song that I'm going to sing to my bride the day we get married. The day we bought this album, we danced to this song and fell in love with it. I pray this song can reach the top of the charts."
2,Disappointing performance,"I prepare a raw diet for our dogs and needed new poultry shears to cut through chicken backs before putting them in my electric grinder. I had read good reviews for this brand, but the handles are not comfortable and the spring is not strong enough to open the blades after making a cut. The blades also tend to slip. I gave up on these and went back to my old ones from Cabela's."
3,Be Warned,"i knew before buying this set that the cd's were not the complete show. however, i did not know, and nothing anywhere will tell you, that some songs have been shortened. Antelope is missing about 5 minutes of its ending (the best part!). it just ends mid buildup. pretty big letdown.bottom line: you're buying this for the dvd's. the cd's are a bummer."
3,Wish I could RATE this item but unfortunately...,"I really wanted the SwissGold Coffee Filter KF 4. I mean I was waiting and so excited to finally get it. The package arrived... I was smiling... until I opened the package and discovered that I was sent the wrong item. Instead of getting the KF 4, I was sent the One-Cup Tea filter. :-( Well, they said that I could send it back and they would give me a refund. BUT... what a hassel to go through all of that... you see I had to have it shipped to a relative in the USA, who then shipped it to me in Sweden. To get it back to them would cost more than the item. Anyway, hope you enjoy your SwissGold KF 4. Wish I could enjoy one."
1,Filter failure,"We purchased this filter after owning a previous metal filter (different brand) that lasted for over 5 years. This filter developed cracks in the metal fabric within a few months and it became almost unusable after about 5 months. Also found that the plastic extender ring did not fit snugly and often fell off. The distributor says that the filter is very sensitive, and the cracks are from tapping the filter against the lid of the garbage can to get the grounds out. Since that's the only way to remove wet grounds without washing them all down the drain, this filter is clearly too sensitive for me. Anyone who uses the tap technique should not purchase this item."
3,Works As Well As Cheaper Ones,"I did not notice any difference in performance (coffee flavor, etc) with this filter vs. my old $10 cheap gold filter. The old one still works fine but it's over 3 years old and I figured I'd give this a try. It is, however, constructed better than the cheap ones and includes a height adapter for large capacity coffeemakers (mine's a 10-cup and it just about fits without the adapter). In spite of the sturdier construction, in my opinion it does not warrant 3X the price."
3,Lets the coffee through too fast,"The biggest issue I have with the filter is it lets the water flow the grounds through *way* too fast, making a weaker cup than usual. The first time I used this, I actually poured the water over the grounds twice to get something that looks like a regular cup of coffee.The filters I'm used to using are paper Filtropa, and I usually use about 2TBS coffee per 8 oz cup. I think I'll stick with the paper until I run out. The paper filters have no problem making a decent cup.I'm using the Swissgold filter with a one-cup pour-over filter holder from Sweet Maria's and 195+ degree F filtered water."
3,overhyped,"I have owned a few of these over the years, and frankly, they are overhyped. The best thing that can be said of them is that they are much easier to deal with than paper filters - rinse them out, and you're done. I have yet to see one that isn't bent up before it's even taken out of the package, and they are damaged easily. I have to assume that the reason they cost more than twice as much as other similar filters is the gold plating. They let far more sediment through than they should for the price, otherwise - about on par with the cheapie knockoffs. I don't mind the sludge as much as many people, but for the amount that ends up in my cup, I'd rather have french press coffee. That said, I'll probably stick with them, if only for the convenience factor described earlier."
3,Too porous,"The reusability is nice but it is way too porous I have even tried using a french press grind, which obviously makes horrible drop coffee but even with that courseness grinds still come through the filter."
1,No startling revelations,"This book is dull and does not unravel anything that the average person who can rise to the top cannot derive on its own - if you are just graduating from college, this may seem appropriate, if you've been around in the business world - seek other material. One reading suggestion, which is light and very simple, but a good reminder of what's required is the book by Lencioni: "" The 5 temptations of a CEO"" - worth an hour while waiting at the airport between flights."
3,prescriptive but not very tedious,"I was looking for books on CEO behavior and I stumbled on this one. Any book that states 'n' rules to success can get very tiring and boring very quickly. However I managed to complete the book very quickly as it turned out be a very light treatment of management theories based on conversations with some CEOs. No reason to believe this is the best advice out there on this topic. If there was any research, it was not evident or not postulated well. What I liked about the book includes the chapter titles (the most important reason I was drawn to this book) and a streak of sincerity I felt in the overall message."
4,Not perfect but not bad.,"I don't have as much of a problem with this battery pack; it's a little bulky but I actually like that as it doesnt really matter unless you want to carry it in your pocket and it actually gives it a better balance and feel in my opinion. Also it's easy to recharge- just set it in the cradle along with the GBA, plus you can use it as an AC adapter by plugging the cable directly into the battery instead of the cradle. Really the only problem I have with it is the meathod of clipping it to the gamboy is a little cheap. It's kinda hard to put it in words, but you can bump the little thing and accidently unclip the battery, but thats only happened once for me. That is really the only reason I don't give it 5 stars. It does the job and it's easy and cheap. Buy it unless you just think another one's better."
2,Useless,"When I first bought mine, I was exited. But now that I started using it, it is disappointing. It sometimes pops out of your Game Boy Advance, makes it alot heavier, takes alot of space and looks totally groosum. The only good thing is that it can replace batteries for 15 hours before you have to recharge."
2,"beautiful, but hard to wield, tiny finger holes","I bought these and returned them for the above reasons. They just were not comfortable to use. I love love love my extra large serving spoon, and want to buy some of the other Hospitality pieces, but my experience with these is they had form over function, beautiful, but I need salad tongs that are easy to use."
4,Optomistic and Faith -filled,A cozy book for 5-8 year-olds about how to turn a bad thing (rain on your picnic day) into a good one. God and Jesus are mentioned several times but it is not overpowering pious. The Grandma has lots of wonderful ideas of things to do on a rainy day with her granddaughter.
2,Stronger material available,"I noticed that some reviewers were noting that the material was a little too thin.I needed something similar, and came across a store in Philadelphia that sellsthe spring bronze V channel in strips. They are at kilianhardware on the internet.They have many types and sizes of these strips in 36"" or 48"". Hope that does the trick for some of your needs.It doesn't work for me because I have those springy ""aluminum"" channels that the sash rides onI am not a representative of that store!"
5,The cards talk!,Literally! Each one of the cards in the pack has a story to tell. The play ranges from amusing to wonderful. Right through the Pack is probably in everyone's top ten all-time bridge books.
3,"Fun, but easily destroyed by 3yr old","This toy is pretty fun for my 2.5yr old son and is safe enough to use indoors when it's raining outside. However, the rocket fins come off in about 1 use. It's just not very durable. Also, when the fins come off the rockets don't fly very far. It was cheap, but even so I would not buy this again."
4,Stomp rocket fun,Loads of fun for hours! Great way to introduce the kids to rockets and projectiles. Safe to use inside also.
4,Rocket love.,"My boys love this rocket. Easy to use and the rocket goes high. Watch out, had to retrieve a few from the roof. The price was right too."
2,"Product damaged in both Stomp rocket, jr and high performance stomp rocket","I purchased this for my 4 yr old godson, and was so disappointed when his mother called to ask for the order number as the rockets were damaged. I figured it was just a fluke, until my nephew opened his ""high performance stomp rocket"" that I got for him off amazon and two of the rockets were stuck together, one being completely smashed, and the fin off another one. He completely ripped open the box in his excitement to get to them when I wasn't looking, so it would be hard to return. I was so disappointed in this product. The company needs some serious quality control and a look into the shipping and packaging of this product."
3,Too hard to stomp,"When little tykes use this rocket they have difficulty getting the hang of ""stomping"" on the ball. When they get old enough to really ""get"" it they are soon bored with it. Not the best toy I've ever picked. If you need the exercise you will enjoy running all over the house/yard and retrieving the rockets."
5,Great,"My 4 yr. old was crazy about this toy. Actually, the whole family liked it. It got the kids away from electronics for a long time. One of the rockets was bent and another broke after a while but both flew just fine even like that. It seemed to bother me more that the kids."
2,Fun for 15 minutes.,"I purchased this for my son, aged six. As the title of my review states, he loved it for about 15 minutes, until he (and I) got tired of propping up the launcher because it's too flimsy to stand on its own. The fins began to fall off the rockets after the second time playing with this toy. Launch height claims are exaggerated unless the person ""stomping"" is a fully-grown adult - little guys can't generate the force required to send this toy much more than twelve to fifteen feet into the air. Overall, a waste of my time and money."
5,"So much fun, but fins aren't very durable","I got this for my 4 year old son who loves. I'm not sure who had more fun with it - the adults in the playground or the kids. all the kids took turns jumping on the stomp rocket and sending the rockets high into the air. Once the adults jumped on it, they went well over 100 feet high and the kids had a great time running and trying to catch them. Unfortunately the fins easily tear off of the rockets when they are handled by the kids in the rough way that little kids will handle things. Good thing I bought extra rockets!"
4,Stomp Rocket Jr,This was such a hit with my 4 year old twins. It's not much to look at. It's a simple rather inexpensive toy. Didn't cost the manufacturer much to make it! But the fun! The kids stomp or jump on a plastic oval shaped piece filled with air. That pushes the air up a tube so that the rockets fly high up in to the air. It's very easy and any child could do it. This can be played with indoors b/c the rockets are soft and wouldn't harm anything. Ours constantly hits our 18ft ceiling or flies all over the house. Worse case a rocket lands somewhere high where you need a ladder to get it. I'd say the age range would be 2-7. Maybe go to the non-junior version for older kids. I'd also buy more than one if you plan to use this at a party or have this out for a group of kids.
4,Kids had fun with it.,"The kids had a lot of fun with it, but two things happened. The fins fell off the rockets (which didn't seem to affect them, but was a disappointing), and within a week they had lost all three rockets... not the manufacturers fault, but play with this in an open area.Overall, the kids loved it and fought over whose turn it was to stomp it. Good for ages 2 and up.I see that one of the tags is for ""educational"" but it is a reach at best to call this educational."
4,Fun for all..,"Used this a a birthday party. Everyone enjoyed this toy. Glow in the dark did not really glow that much, but it was good to have extras."
5,"Son, AND the family loves it!","My son LOVES this toy. He received it when he was three and I was concerned, like others, that because of his size, he wouldn't be strong enough to launch the rocket. This was NOT a problem.I'm also pleased to report that we safely used the Stomp Rocket INSIDE! The force of the rockets with the ""Junior"" version, and the rockets themselves did not damage light fixtures, lamps, etc.I agree with other reviewers that the stand, or base, is a bit flimsy. It often falls over while stomping. Plus, the hose that attaches to the base can twist.One more point, if your child is like mine and likes to takes things apart to see how they work, put the rockets away after using the Stomp Rocket. He pulled almost all of the fins off the bottom of the rockets! Luckily, Super Glue did work to reattach the fins, but it's difficult to get the fins back on exactly straight and this messes with the trajectory of the rockets! Also, you can order replacement rockets."
4,Fun and worth the purchase!,"My 2 1/2 year old son loves this toy and is able to step/ work the launcher by himself. It is not the most durable-the launcher occasionally comes apart and needs to be snapped back together, but an easy fix. We had hours of fun the first day he played with this toy, launching rockets across the yard and then chasing them down. Worth the buy-would definitely recommend!"
5,"Durable, incredibly fun toy","We have 5 kids and a LOT of toys. (Thanks Grandma and Grandma and Grandpa and......) So it's rare for us to find a new toy that's a MUST-HAVE. But this was it! Our 3 year old played with this toy NON-STOP at the beach last summer. 2 hours straight every time we would go. The rockets fly fast and swift and float gently down for the kids to try and chase and catch. Shooting them off in a wide open space is best, too many pine trees for us in our yard! But they quickly shake back down to the ground. The beach or park is best, but be prepared for every kid in the park to become magnetized and beg to try! Luckily their are four rockets, and they're just as much fun to try to catch as they are to shoot up in the sky!"
3,Fun but not built to last,"My twins (just under 3 yrs old) loved this toy but unfortunately it is cheaply made and didn't last very long. The blue pieces quickly fell off the rockets and the yellow plastic ""launcher"" is now in pieces as well. It's priced cheap enough that I'll probably buy another one when they are a bit older & can play a little more carefully."
3,Don't stomp too hard!,"I was really excited to order Stomp Rocket Jr. for my grandson for Christmas. He was delighted with it, and had a ""stomping good time"" for about 20 minutes, then one of the three legs of the yellow plastic base broke. He was disappointed....the rocket wouldn't stand up by itself... no more stomping. So, grandpa to the rescue. He built a four legged wooden stand to support the rocket, and off the rocket flew again. The concept is good, the stand didn't hold up."
4,Simple active fun!,"My two yr old and 8 yr old loved this toy! It is easy to use. Put the rocket on the launcher and stomp on the pad and let the air shoot it. Totally boy energy and fun! The rockets hold up well to play. However, older kids stomping too hard can ruin the pad. I listened to many a laugh. Though it didn't take long for him to figure out how to aim it at things ... not always so good :o). Really my only complaint is the plastic strips that held the launching pad together wouldn't stay put. So a while of stomping and it would fall apart. It was too hard for a 3-5 yr old to put back together.I would buy again!"
5,Fun fun fun,"My 3 year-old and 6 year-old love this toy. The rockets are soft and light enough so as not to harm to anyone who is accidentally or intentionally hit with one (as long as you don't get it in the eye)... just like getting hit with a Nerf dart. Good for indoor and outdoor play.The launch base is fairly well made and easy to put together. Just push the pieces together and attach the hose with the carrage bolt and wingnut and you're ready to go. The bolt does not fall out of the tube which is nice. It would be nice if the base were a bit heavier. We use bean bags to stabilize it, but it is not necessary."
4,Loads of fun,"Stomp rockets are loads of fun! If you have the space in your basement or outside, you can make the rockets go very far and very high! The base is not good at all. It keeps falling apart, although it is easily put back together. Good exercise for kids if they go get the rockets and bring them back to stomp on it again!"
5,The Perfect Toy,If you're a 4 year old boy it doesn't get much better than this!! On Christmas morning all Carter wanted to do was play with his rocket and when he wasn't playing with it he wanted to carry it everywhere in his wagon. The rockets themselves are foam so yeah they rip and get stuck in trees or on the roof (all part of the fun of course) so make sure to have a refill pack of rockets on hand.
3,I'd pay more for something more durable,My 2.5 year old had a great time for the 2 hours that it lasted. All the rockets were beat-up and useless after a couple hours. And the base constantly fell apart. I'd be willing to pay more for something more durable.
4,Great toy for little boys,"We have a set and have given away sets to multiple friends as gifts. All kids love it, and the foams is light and soft, so even using it in the house on a rainy day (and we have a lot of breakables on high shelves) is not a big deal. Wish the stand and the foam rockets were more durable, I'm worried the stand is going to snap any day now, as the plastic is already showing signs of fatigue (We've had it for 3 months) and my son has already ripped the fins off of all the foam rockets multiple times (I even went and bought special glue for styrofoam 'cause the replacement rockets are almost as much as the set). Nevertheless, the little ones love jumping on the rocket launcher and making them fly."
3,Rockets fall apart,I got this for my 4 year old son for Easter after reading the great reviews. It is a fun toy and my son enjoyed it at first. After 2 days of use all of the rockets were broken even an extra set that I had purchased with it. The launcher seems fairly durable and easy to use but the rockets need some help.
4,Great Toy!,"I bought this as a gift for my 4-year-old nephew. He loves it! The rockets really fly far. He loves running out to pick them up as much as he does stomping to make them go. He's had hours of fun playing with the Stomp Rocket. The stand is adjustable so he can make the rocket shoot way out into the yard, or straight up into the air. The rockets are soft foam, so there is no risk of injury for anyone who gets in the line of fire. It came with four darts which are large enough to not get lost easily, and they glow in the dark!"
2,"Great idea, but what a piece of cr*p!","It's a basic idea and good for little kids (boys especially): jump on the pad and the rocket flies high. My son loves playing with it. Unfortunately it's the cheapest toy I've ever purchased, the quality is horrible. The launch stand constantly falls apart and the rockets themselves are made for about 30 minutes of good play before they are broken and useless.You've been warned, this is the worst quality imported toy EVER produced."
3,Fun for my grandson,This was chosen from my grandson's wish list. He likes it but it's rather flimsy. The base comes apart easily.
3,Fun for a while,"My 3-yr old girl loved these, but lost interest in them after a few months. I do like the soft foam, which doesn't break things if used indoors."
5,Great toy for the park,"My boys saw this at the park and asked for one for their birthday. It is one of those cheap toys (cheap in price not quality) that the kids love. When ever we take it to the park with us kids always come over and ask if they can do it. The toy came as expected and works as it should. I do suggest buying extra rockets as they can be lost in trees, neighbors yards, ect. I found some rockets at toys r us that went to a nerf like gun that work fine also."
1,Rockets fell apart instantly while toddler jumped on pneumatic device,"Rockets were total junk and fell apart instantly. They came off too quickly for our toddler even to see what had happened, which was also frustrating...very disappointing. Also, you will then be left with this purple thing to stomp on, and a long plastic tube. Our toddler constantly ate the tube and jumped on the device, which probably isn't a good thing."
1,"Arrived Broken, in Pieces","Ordered this toy to give to my toddler nephews on Christmas morning. Appallingly, the packaging and the overall quality were such that the pieces in the box were broken on arrival (little broken yellow pieces of the ""launchpad""). Shouldn't have expected much given the price, but would have liked to expect a working toy--not broken pieces of plastic. It looks great, but do yourself a favor and avoid."
4,Loads of fun!,Bought this to play with my 7 yr old nephew when he came to visit for a few days. We went to the park and had a great time figuring out different ways to launch the missiles and catch them. I bought both the lightweight and plastic missile the lighter ones seemed to go farther but damaged more easily. Make sure you have extra refills. A game that all ages can play together and have fun.
4,Pretty cool toy!,"Got this for 3 yr old. We are putting it up for his birthday, but Dad and I got it out while he was sleeping. Its a cool toy! :)"
4,good toy,I bought this because it had fantastic reviews. It didn't disappoint me when I received it. The only complaint I have is that it is not durable. It was all torn apart when several of my daughter's friends come to my house to play. And I even don't know how to put them back together. I couldn't remember if this toy came with any instructionon how to assembly it.
4,Great Inexpensive Gift,"I got this for my 4 year olds birthday in July 2011 and he loved it, as did my 7 year old. Both the rockets and stomp pad have held up to horrible abuse from my boys. The toys only flaw is the weak stand that supports the launch tube. Otherwise it ROCKS! We just did away with the support and hold it in our hand. The rockets will go very high and kids get to learn about science as they try to determine the effects of the wind on the rocket and where it will land. (You'll want to keep it away from trees and roofs:c) This is now the standard b-day gift for the kids friends and has never failed to be a hit, and is generally the first toy the kids open and play with at the parties. For the price it's a great toy!"
5,Best. Toy. Ever. (for the price),"This toy combines two of my 3-year old son's favorite things: stomping and rockets. It takes seconds to put together and is ready to go. And it works. Durable enough to stomp on hard. Flies high. For added fun, it can be easily weaponized by simply aiming the rocket sideways at the screw. So, it might be worth buying two."
3,Hours of fun for tshe little ones,"This is a great toy for the young kids and those of us young at heart. The stand is a little clumsy and the rocket fins come offtoo easy. 6 kids played with this for hours before the first rocket fell apart, but it has kept them quite busy since we got it."
5,Enjoyed by both the kids and adults,"I purchased this for my visiting 4 year-old niece and 2 year-old nephew to play with outside. The rockets really do shoot far into the air, and it is a lot of fun playing with the angles and distance possibilities. Both kids loved the stomping aspect as well as watching the rockets soar. However, I think that the adults (in their 30's, 40's and 60's) had even more fun with it. Especially since the kids didn't seem to mind running after the rockets to bring them back to the launcher.There wasn't any real assembly involved, and it is lightweight enough to walk to a park or playground carrying it.The kids need to understand that the rockets should not be used as toys other than with this toy/game or there is a risk to pulling off the wings (which can be glued back on) or other damage since they are made of very lightweight foam. We played with these for probably 8 hours in a week and all of the pieces held up well."
4,Stompt Rocket Jr review,My grandson absolutely loved this toy. He is not yet 3 but had seen it at a friend's house. The assembly for the stand took a bit but once it went together the rest was easy. He shot the rockets very high but they do no damage coming down which is why I love it.
5,Stomp rocket: kids never get tired of it,This is a fun toy. Great because no batteries are needed! Kids and adults of all ages enjoy watching the rocket fly. Wear out the little ones by letting them take turns chasing the rockets.
1,Package not acceptable.,"This is a holiday present for a four year old boy. By all the information provided, it looked like a toy he would like. Unfortunately, the box the toy came in was completely beaten and ripped up. I'm embarrassed to wrap this toy in its current state and offer it as a gift. But I have no choice as return and shipping deadlines are approaching. I like buying on Amazon because I hate the malls. But, I guess there is something to be said about holding a product in your hands before buying it."
4,Sleeper Hit of Christmas,"We got this for our 3 1/2 year old for Christmas and him & his 5 1/2 year old sister would not stop playing with it. Had I known it would have been that fun, I would have bought 2 of them! This thing provides a lot of good old simple fun."
3,10 seconds in and already need duct tape,The hole in the plastic launch tube has already been stretched and rendered useless after twice trying to secure wing nut onto carriage bolt. Had to secure tubing to launch pad using duct tape. Ugh.
5,Great Entertainment for a 4 yr old,"My 4 yr old grandson spent hours playing with his rockets. It was a hit at our family reunion and even his 16 yr old cousin joined in the fun. It seems very durable and stood up to almost constant jumping on the ""launch pad"""
3,Blast up super high with a giant stomp!!,"My 3 year old had to have this after playing with our neighbor's, who actually had a different manufactured one. It certainly launches high, thanks to the big pump and hose, but my 3 year old can't stomp it very high. She has fun with it. The only thing I don't like about it is: the connection of the hose to the base has a cheap wingnut attachment and the base tends to angle off course. I keep having to tighten the wingnut.I think it should have a different base; sturdier. So it gets 1 star for durability and 5 stars for fun factor."
4,fun toy,The kids have enjoyed playing with this and it has lasted at least one day. The rockets fly well and work indoors just fine.
4,Simple and endless fun for my boy (and cousins)!,"I must admit that I had my reservations about this product, but i can now say that is completely amazing. My boy is just 2 years old, but he and his cousins enjoy so much the stomp rocket while they're playing it. It's a little cheap in its materials but well, it's not a expensive toy and creativity is the majority of the price in this case. Totally recommended."
5,"Fun, fun, fun!","Was not sure upon receiving the package,but on Christmas day it was a great hit for all the males in the family. And, if my granddaughter had been old enough she would have been playing with it also!Great fun!"
4,"Outstanding Value, Good Quality, Versatile Size","I'd been searching high and low for a case that would fit the jumbo Alvarez I'd recently got a great deal on. The jumbo cases were rarely in stock, and cost about 40% more on top of the regular prices, presumably owing to that relatively few guitars are jumbos, compared to dreadnoughts. I was in a local music store, and we'd tried just about every case they had. I was about to bite the bullet and give SKB $144 for their case. On a whim, I slid the guitar into this case. Nearly perfect fit, with room for my strap, tuner, capo, a spare set of strings, etc. -- and saved a LOT of money! In the past, Gator cases had been a bit thin and brittle, but today's Gators are an outstanding value. If it had molded feet instead of button feet, I'd give it a solid 5 stars, but unless you're flying with your guitars in checked baggage a lot, that won't matter. Highly recommend this manufacturer & model!"
4,Love this hamper!,"I was reluctant to buy this hamper because of other reviews but I'm glad I did. I gave in and bought it because My baby is named Willow and needed a hamper (I couldnt resist). Yes, it is small but most baby hampers are, I've seen much smaller. It is meant for tiny baby clothes and will last the week. I've had no problems with it coming apart or rough edges. I've had the hamper about 3 or 4 monthes now and its doing great. Glad I overlooked other reviews and made my own decision."
4,Devour the peach,"This film is an Irish production.It stars Eamon Morrisey,a member of the famous Abbey Actors,and also Stephen Brennan another Abbey actor.Some cameo roles here also for Irelands finest Niall Tobin,Joe Lynch.Eat The Peach is a classic story of that madness us Irish posess.Basically it tells the story of 2 blokes who are made redundant from the local Japanese factory.Through sheer boredom while watching the tv at their local pub one day,an Elvis Presley film is being shown about a wall of death with Elvis on the motorbike.Morrisey comes up with the idea to build a wall of death in the heart of the bog of Allen where they live.The story is true and is hilarious,a typical Irish story.The soundtrack alone is fantastic,done by Moving Hearts,with Davy Spillane,and the Title track sung by Paul Brady.All in this is a brilliant film,very much underated.Buy it,it's well worth the cash."
4,life in the eighties,geographically its a mess. certainly underated. but it does capture the mood of what it was like to live in the middle of the bog of allen back in the eighties. it was actually filmed during the summer of 1985. the wettest i can remember. one particularly wet day we watched the boys tearing about the bog (opening credits). i think the sun shines in one scene but i might be wrong. watch it.
1,Eat the peach,"I had heard of this when I was growing up and watched it on a boring Saturday afternoonWhat a complete waste of time! The film was completely without a point, and the usual Irish actors that are in everything else!The only good point was the actor Stephen Brennan,put on a good show,but I am embarrased to be Irish when I watch this drivel.Especially the cowboy smuggler routine. Don't waste your money"
4,A solid vocabulary workout,"The book is divided into theme groupings such as biology, astronomy, sociology etc. It works on the assumption that the reader will put forth the effort to do all the exercises and match the answers. Checking your answers however is a major hassle because the numbering system and the organization of the answer key is not user friendly at all. Best bet is to photocopy the answer sheet and lay it next to you as you work.The book's strength is its thematic presentation as opposed to an alphabetical presentation.My advice, get Kaplan's success with words for the Toefl first and then get this book second."
4,Hard Life For A Witch!!!,"This Sabrina novel takes the Its A Wonderful Life concept in for a pretty fun story.Another novel with the Wonderful Life premise,if you are interested,is Sweet Valley Twins,A Christmas Without Elizabeth."
4,Its A miserable life,This is the best Sabrina book ever. This is a must read if you like Sabrina books
1,not good,I returned this because it was deformed. No eyebrow on one eye. A lumpy face that looked sick. Return went smoothly. Won't buy stuffies from here again.
3,Disappointing,"I must admit that I have quite a few Folkmanis puppets but the quality of this one is noticably inferior to most of the others (except the goat which is even worse). The eyes are poorly fashioned so that they seem to be misaligned & the mouth is so poorly made it's rough, uncomfortable & doesn't work well. I was pleased that it is large enough to be a stuffed toy & the material feels very soft but as a puppet it is not very well made & called to my attention for the first time that these puppets are made in China. Disappointed. I bought it to use for children's sermons on the story of the Nativity & Balaam's talking donkey but don't think I'll use it as a puppet much."
5,donkey puppet,My daughter had seen the donkey puppet at our local library and just loved it. The quality is great and my daughter is enjoying having her own. I definitely recommend the Folkmanis company for their puppets. Our library has a huge collection of them and the children really enjoy playing with them.
1,Oh NO! They Killed Trixie True!,"This show was a riot off-broadway- A Campy production with a terrific score- But this new recording is simply terrible. It's worse than amateurish. The score has been slowed down so such an extent that EVERY song become a slow dirge. The singers are even worse. The music is way above their abilities (how in the world can Trixie True be above anyone's abilities?) Off key, off note, off rhythm- awFul! How did this ever get recorded? It does nothing to preserve this musical's flair or charm. Terrible in every way-"
5,Incredible,"What can I say? This is simply one of the best games ever released for any system, (yes, I'm including PS2 and X-Box) it doesn't quite hit Sonic Adventures' gameplay, it is still superb. Controls will have you a little frantic when you first try them out, but you'll soon be manipulating them like a pro. Your standard mission would be dropping out of an aircraft, locating an enemy mobile suit, boosting over to him and firing your main machine-gun. When you close in, your beam saber pops up and it becomes a furious hand-to-hand battle. Swords probably do the most damage. But during the sword fights, is where the game really shines. After blowing up the enemy (and i mean BLOW. They are really BIG explosions) you have won. Oh yeah, this game isn't half as easy as it sounds."
5,I love this game!,"No I'm not talking about basketball, I'm Talking about GUNDAM for the Dreamcast. This game is nothing less than spectacular, even though it is a little short. Who cares if it doesn't have Gundams or the Gundams from Gundam Wing, The game is still Great!"
2,"VERY fun game, but...","This game is one the most enjoyable games I have ever played. However, it only has nine missions (that's why I only gave it two stars; if it had more missions I'd give it a five). It took me an hour and fifteen minutes to make it through the first time."
3,Gundam Side Story 0079: The Review,"Hey, if your thinking about buying this game..... read this first.See, I pre-ordered the game (before any good reviews were made) so I didnt know what I was bargaining for. The game is not bad, but not what you would expect. You get to pilot mass-production mobile suits; which means no gundams. I have not seen any other Gundam series than Gundam Wing..... but I say, if there are no Gundams, why call it GUNDAM Side Story? Well dont get me wrong, the game is OK, but too short. Buy it if you want but remember NO GUNDAMS!"
4,Short,I loved the game but if your friend has it just play it with him. It will take you about two hours to beat and it is short. It is a rental not a buyer.
2,"If you're a Gundam Fan, but not a Gundam Wing fan","I got this game because I'm a new Gundam Wing fan. I didn't realize that this was ""Gundam"" and not Gundam Wing. You don't pilot Gundams, just mobile suits. The characters aren't japanese animation characters and if I didn't know that Gundam was originaly in Japan, I would have thought that Gundam originated in the U.S.A, because of the way the characters on game look! Over all, if you're a Gundam fan and don't mind piloting the mobile suits instead of Gundams, than this game is for you! Also, thank you to Amazon.com for letting us buy these normally expensive video games so cheap! I would be disappointed, but I got this game from Amazon.com so cheap that I'm not upset! Please keep up the good work Amazon.com ^_^ If you ever need a video game that sold out in the stores, check this place out first!Keep giving us more new releases!"
1,Gundam side Story - Info,"Please bear in mind, the game is titled 'Side Story' It's not actually involving the RX-78 series Gundams, but the RX-79 GMs or General Manufacture Mobile Suits. Also, this has *absolutely* nothing to do with Gundam Wing. Gundam Wing itself is a Alternate Timeline story. AC (After Colony) versus the UC (Universal Century) of the actual Gundam universe. This game takes place in the aftermath of the first operation where a colony was dropped on the earth, *before* the deployment of the prototype RX-78 Gundam. The Federation was just beginning to deploy Mobile Suits while the Jions had been using Mobile Suits for quite some time............."
1,I have more fun watching nascar and no one watches nascar,So i when i bought this game a Funcoland the peopel who worked there said if you like the show you will like the game... I didn't realize that they where full of $h!t. Don't waste your money because this game wasted my money and 10 minuets that i will never get back.
2,Gundam Woes,"This game is definately not worth the purchase, but rather a rental. This is due to the small amount of missions and lackluster game control. I think the worst part is that you don't even get to pilot the gundam but rather some generic UFF mobilesuilts. The only thrill this game delivers is fighting with Zaku's and Dom's and the well crafted cut scenes. However, the battles are quite tedious as they consist of the same 3 moves; guard, lock on and attack. If you are itching for a good mecha game buy Mechwarrior 3 or Shogo. Rent this game instead as one can beat it in a day or two."
3,"A great game, but too short...","I think the title says most of it. GSS0079 is FAR too much fun for the short time you get to play it (say it with me: Awwwww...).If I could change anything about this game, I would make the RX-79[G] Gundam Ground Type one of the default choices instead of limiting the players to mass-production mecha types like the GM and the RX-77D Guncannon Mass Prod Type."
4,Nearly perfect,"I like this record a lot. The first time I heard it, I was shopping for new speakers for my stereo. The salesman at a high-end audio store played it for me, saying that it is a staple for demonstrating audio gear. Which is to say, it's really nicely produced and has lots of interesting sounds across the sound spectrum. He went on to say that 90% of the people for whom he plays the record go on to buy it. So that is how I came to acquire it.Patricia Barber is a gifted songwriter, and the lyrics to her songs are clever, witty, and engaging. So you might be wondering ""why only four stars?"" The reason I withhold the fifth star is that Ms. Barber goes off on a couple of vocal tangents where she completely loses her way. For example, on the second track ""Mourning Grace"" she sings off key for nearly an entire minute. Frank Sinatra made an entire career out of singing off key, but I hope Ms. Barber does not continue to follow his lead."
2,A beautiful voice wasted,"I found her voice which I had heard on the Lady Sings the Blues compilation to be absolutely wonderful. I found the material and especially the instrumental arrangements to be quite awful. Sometimes droning on in repitive long stretchs that remind one of machine music rather than creative movement where ideas are explored. Often they are in dischordant sounds that seem to seek strangeness rather than musical meaning.Listen carefully before ordering this if you are not familiar with her material. It goes straight to my ""Sell"" pile, I'm afraid."
2,Way overhyped,"I will go against all the hype on this disc and share with you that I am absolutely bored by this CD. I purchased it after it seemed from the reports that this CD was the best way to find what your audio system is capable of... well, maybe it is, but I can assure you there's no pleasure in the singer's off-key numbers, the annoying timbre of her voice, and the chalk-breaking falsetto in one of the tracks. Bottom line --do your own thing and stay away from this one."
3,"Awful brush for showering or bath, great DRY brush.","I wanted a brush for the shower, and this isn't it. Really, it hurts in the shower. Use only DRY before your shower. kinda weird, but nice for scratching off dead skin and stimulating softness.Not so great is, the head does not stay on if you hang it upside down."
2,Kinda painful,Ouch... It hurts to scrub anything other than my feet bottoms. I am going to soak it in oil for a few days and see if it softens it up.
1,Smells like dead meat,This brush smells like dead meat even after leaving it outside for weeks. As I am vegetarian this is unacceptable. Would not order.
2,Handle came out after 6 uses.,"Used about 6 times and the handle came completely out of the grove in the head that holds the two pieces together. Just got done hammering the head back on and covered head and handle in groove with glue, hopefully it stays in."
3,Exact same as nut-milk bags,"These appear to be identical to the nut-milk bags. Not sure what I was expecting, but I didn't think they'd be the same product. Thought this should be pointed out to anyone else considering this product."
3,yerba prima tampico skin brush,Item is very nice quality but the problem is that ist way to sharp for my skin and painful to use..
3,One fault brings it down :(,"This skin brush could have been perfect. The brush itself is amazing. Scrubs very well, very durable. The only problems is the handle it attaches to. To attach it, you just slide it in. When scrubbing your back, it will just as easily slide out. I believe a screw in option would make this thing perfect. If it were not for the handle falling off, i would have given this item 5 stars, one of the main reasons i got this item was to scrub my back"
4,A Little Rougher Than I Expected,"I have used skin brushes for many years for the benefit of skin clearness and cirulation. I am pleased with this brush, but it might be a bit harsh (the Tampico type) for someone who has NEVER skin brushed before. I have been happy with brushes bought at the local drug store with the softer brushes and I feel recieved the same benefit. I will continue to use this brush, but buyers if you have never used a skin brush, use this one a little lighter to the touch on your skin when you use it."
3,not the brush pictured,"the brush i received was similar to, but not, the brush that is pictured for this product. the brush i received was in 2 pieces, and i wouldn't have ordered it if i had known that, because i have used them in the past, and the brush head flies off when you are trying to use it. this is no different, the brush head flies off during use."
5,Really enjoying this brush,"I bought this brush specifically for dry brushing. I have been using it a week, and I really like the way it feels on my skin. I have sensitive skin, so it is nice that it isn't too harsh. I would definitely recommend this brush. After the first and second day of use I noticed an improvement in my digestion as well. I thought it quite odd, but it is supposed to be one of the benefits of dry brushing. I have not removed the handle, but I don't think I am going to."
5,refreshing,"I was a bit scared to use this brush. I thought that it might leave scratch marks on my body. Not at all! I love dry brushing before I shower. It helps my body to feel ""woken up."""
1,"Could be great, but wooden brush base split after 1 week","When this item arrived, it far surpassed my expectation. The brush base was made of thick wood. There's also a plastic base between the wood and the bristles and that also appeared to be well made and substantial. And as far as the brush, it is thick and full of what appears to be well distributed, healthy, firm bristles. As far as function, the item was exactly as described; it resulted in a great massage and exfoliation of the skin (a bit tough the first use, but by the third time, my skin felt less sensitive and more stimulated). Unfortunately, after the third use, I noticed cracks in both ends of the wooden base. It was obvious that it wouldn't be long before the cracks would expand and meet in the middle. This would render the brush unusable."
5,gets the job done,"I like it. Its sturdy. the bristles don't come out all over the place like some cheap brushes I've found. Its ROUGH but its the perfect amount of rough. I have sensitive skin too and my skin loves this brush. It'll make you're skin soft as butter. I don't use it everyday though, just every now and then. Maybe three or so times a week. (Not that I COULDNT use it everyday...I just forget) I had no issues with the top popping off or anything. Great buy."
4,Great brush,I did not experience what other users are suggesting - that the handle comes out of the brush. Worked well for me. I give it four stars because you *can* get this item cheaper at a local chain store.
4,Great brush for your skin,"I love this brush. At first it hurts a little, then you get used to that refreshing tingly feeling. I read it takes 30 days to begin to see results. Not quite to the 30 days yet."
2,Rough bristles,"There was no description of the bristle strength. Upon receiving them I find they are very rough, but will suggest to my clients they could soften in a hot water soak. It would be nice to get an indication of the bristle grade as part of the description."
1,Handle does not withstand the pressure of this brush when using,"First, I thought this was brush I could use in the shower, but bedsides that the handle comes apartment from the brush very easily so it does not withstand the pressure when using and when I hang it, come back a few minutes later and the brush is apart from the handle... very annoying..."
2,Not so good,"I guess if you have skin like an alligator, this product might be okay. This brush is very stiff and rough. If you have sensitive skin, I would pass on this brush. I tried rinsing the brush out and found that the next day it had already cracked and the handle was loose."
4,Nice!,"I really like this skin brush. I had a little difficulty getting the handle to stay on, but once on I like it a lot. Also, shipping took a little longer than usual, but not enough to complain about."
2,Way too rough,"This brush is extremely rough on the skin. It cannot be used for massage, only light surface exfoliation. The bristles are dense and tightly packed, and feel even rougher than boar's bristles. If that's what you're looking for, it is otherwise well made, but I find it too painful to use."
2,not for the shower/bath,"Very rough and has an unpleasant odor. We like a good scrub, but this was too much. I realize the main purpose was not for the shower, but I hoped it could also be used for bathing. Oh well."
1,Junk,This thing was junk. I was only able to get a few uses out of it before it started to fall apart and look gross.
2,You don't really even get what you pay for...,"This is a terrible quality brush. The wood is splintered and unfinished, and the bristles barely look natural. You can buy a much better quality natural bristle brush for dry brushing at TJ Maxx for the exact same price. I might use this one to clean my car, but it won't touch my body."
2,Smells horrid,"Ive owned two of these brushes, the first deserved a rating of 3.5 stars, but this second one smells like diarrhea mixed with vomit and B.O.Cons:Smells like vomit, diarrhea and B.O., does not go away after washingThe bristles are very harsh at first but do soften up after a couple of usesThe head of the brush does not stay on and will fall off occasionallyThere is a hole in the handle for a rope, but one does not come with the brushPros:Very affective with good coverage and just the right amount of exfoliation once the bristles soften up"
5,THIS BRUSH IS HEAVEN IN YOU SKIN,"i started using this product 5 days ago since I heard that is amazing for skin and for cellulite. I brush my skin from toes to arms in circular motions during five minutes before entering the shower and my results are:1. Softer skin, the first day I could see dust of dry skin coming out of me,2. Moisturizer absorbs better.3. Cellulite is getting better (Also I started eating healthy and drinking lots of water, so there is a tip)4. My skin tone looks even now. You know that you can get some dark spots from sun exposure even if I use sun protection. but now my skin looks nice and I can wear sleeve less tops.5. The legs look way better too and I think that the brushing may also help slimming the body a bit.Recommended 100% great product amazing price and shipping!NOTE: If you're new in skin brushing it is gonna be a little unpleasant the first two days. don't go to hard on it just circular motions."
4,Body Brush,"The Yerba Prima Tampico Skin Brush is a nice, if used lightly, which is the proper way to use it!"
5,Excellent shower brush,"Perfect firmness -- not to soft, not too firm. I feel like I'm really able to scrub off the dirt and dead skin from all parts of my back. It did come off the handle once, so my only little gripe is that I really don't need a handheld brush, but that would be easily fixable with a little glue, if you want it to stay on the long handle permanently. As for those who say it is too firm, well they must have thin skin. You can't please everyone. But I think it is a great brush -- so I bought two."
3,Smells when wet,It is a dry brush but I willl bot recommend for it to accidentally get wet.. it smells. it is a bit harsh when you now start to use it and I have not been using it that long enough for it to get softer.
2,Painful and head falls off,"It's much tougher than I expected, but I'm trying to learn to deal with it. And the head has fallen off twice already in less than a week from the handle."
5,Feels so Good!,"This is perfect for dry-brushing - the handle helps for those hard-to-reach places, but detaches easily (the handle slots into the back of the brush). My first skin-brushing almost-but-not-quite hurt - instead, it was very stimulating, and my entire body felt tingly afterwards. It almost felt like a shower itself! Every inch of me was alive with energy. What an amazing feeling."
5,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I purchased this CD after reading one of the reviews. I have another Streetwize CD that I love, but I was a litter weary about getting this one (Jazz meets Dre and all). But I am glad I made the purchase, as I am thoroughly enjoying it."
1,Not for children,"I was extremely disappointed at the vulgar language and violence depicted. For adults the game is fine , but not at all for children of any age"
3,cubic zirconia sterling earrings,"the earrings are very pretty.however, they arrived over a week late.AND both earrings were broken.fortunately, i was able to repair them with needle-nose pliers - which probably not everyone owns a set of.so frankly, no, i would not recommend this vendor."
1,Dull,"Overlooking its mockery and pornographic elements, this dull and unfunny book is idiotic, droning, impenetrable, empty and stupid. It is not only pretentious but wholly empty of good taste, beauty, or any worthwhile content."
2,Flat as a Tire That Ran Over a Cactus,"This movie is not at all about how Melvin's life is ""transformed"" by his encounter with Hughes. It is about Melvin's life as a loser, and a rather unpleasant one at that. After rescuing Hughes after a motorcycle crash in the desert, Melvin pretty much forgets about the incident; there are no further references to it until nearly the end of the film, when he learns Hughes has named him as a beneficiary in his will. Those intervening years are the subject of this movie. They aren't very interesting years. Melvin flits in an out of marriage, in and out of low-grade jobs. He is an irritating, rather dopey character, as is his wife (played by Mary Steenburgen). The acting and cinematography are pretty good, but what is the point of this movie? The will is not proven to be valid; Melvin doesn't even get the dough."
2,Boring,"""The FBI Crime Lab"" provided little specifics on how its equipment worked, and was slow-moving and boring.The DVD began describing its new facility (4X the size of former space) in Quantico, VA., costing $150 million, using nearly 700 employees, and taking in about 600 pieces of evidence/day. The FBI started forensics services in 1932.Viewers then receive a brief overview of the lab's various units: Firearms and Tool Marks, Explosives Unit, Latent Print Unit (utilizes 80 different processes for finding and examining prints), DNA Unit (both nuclear (2 copies/cell) and mitochondrial (many more copies/cell), Chemistry and Trace Evidence Unit (eg. hairs, fibers, etc.), and its Hazardous Scene Response Units (protective suits, robots)."
2,Boring for people who know alittle in life i would assume.,"Its giving a 43 min (YES not 50 min) insight into their most fancy lab F.B.I /150 million dollar building with 700 workers.Its superficial, and gives nothing i didnt knew already anyway, for some new into this? then it might show you around the facility with short shallow observations on the themes as gun ballistic and fingerprints and such very vidid and not into details, whatever it might be, very little forensic informations was to be found on my behalf seeing it.Viking."
2,Disappointed,"I don't know whats going on in the art quilt world these days, but it seems to me that the more you can change the structure of the fabric, the more chance you have to get into a venue like this. These quilts pretty much all look alike to me, and it appears to me that the artists have qualified for this venue by slopping,dropping, and plopping as much gunk on the fabric as it can hold. There is more to art quilting than surface design! I do have to say that there are some truely breathtaking works in this book, but over all I was extremely disappointed. There is more to art quilting than pure abstraction and embellishment!"
2,Wouldn't hold pressure,"It would spray fine, but wouldn't hold pressure for longer than 15 seconds.Some other issues were : the bottom of the straps wouldn't stay clipped to the frame and the pump handle needed a bolt & nut rather than a cotter pin to fasten it more securely to the pump mechanism so it wasn't so sloppy.I could have fixed those problems, but the holding pressure problem was a no go, so I sent it back for a full refund."
4,Chapin 62000 Backpack Sprayer,"I bought this sprayer because I'm putting down a sealer on a large concrete driveway. I wanted something with more capacity than my hand held, and something I could pump on-the-go while spraying. I've only used it twice but so far so good. It has worked well and has saved me alot of time and effort. I'm no expert on sprayers, but it seems well built and I'm impressed with its 4 filter points to prevent clogging of the spray nozzle. You may find the shoulder, chest and waist straps a little awkward, but they make the sprayer secure and comfortable to wear, even with a full tank. The pump handle is ambidextrous which is convenient for lefties. My only con is that there is alot of lost motion between the pump handle and its mounting point on the sprayer. This creates too much lost motion in the handle, and makes pumping less efficient than it should be. Otherwise, I rate the Chapin 62000 a solid 4."
4,Nice sprayer!,"I had the chance to use the sprayer and wow, very comfortable. The hose coming out of the bottom of the tank did leak, but with a tightening of the hose clamp, no more leaks. The wand holder on the pump handle is a good idea but needs work. It really doesn't hold the wand in a good position and it ends up falling out. So far, all in all it seems to be a quality unit."
1,BEWARE,"BEWARE-I searched for Backpack sprayers, the picture shows a complete sprayer, and theproduct description is:Tree/Turf Pro Commercial Backpack Brass wand Sprayer. Chapin's best quality backpack sprayer. Strap it on your back and get the job done fast with 4-Gallon true capacity poly sprayer.However, all I got was the spray trigger unit. While the price might be a clue, I thought that it could be a closeout."
1,"A great sprayer for the price, but...","A good high-quality unit, but the harness leaves something to be desired. The complexity is akin to strapping on a g-suit to pilot an F-15. Hope I don't trip and fall down with the unit attached, as I may never be able to get out of the harness! The back padding is a nice touch, but somebody was not thinking, as the fill markings are UNDER the back pad. Why not on the sides?Follow-up review. The more I use this, the more I hate it, particularily the handle attachment method. There is so much free play that pumping is difficult and my arm get tired quickly. One user mentioned he drilled out the retaining pin hole and installed a bolt. An owner should not have to do this! Good grief, who did all the positive reviews on this sprayer, manufacturer employees in their spare time? I now wish I had ordered another Solo instead of this. I am downgrading the rating to a 1. I wonder if Amazon or the manufacturer will take it back?"
5,Should have gotten this a long time ago,Love the way this handles and makes a long job shorter and efficient. Should have purchased this a long time ago.
4,fine product,excellent product and so much better than lugging around a gallon sprayer with a top-mount hand pump. Well made except one of the back straps was twisted and sewn so I would have to take it apart to correct - a minor but uncomfortable flaw.
3,I thought I like some kinds of gory stories but..........,"Gustainis is one of my better finds recently, however.....This book is without doubt the most gory, outright hard to get past the evil, that I could not finish it.Anatomy is better to imagine sometimes....."
2,"Cheap, but works. Barely.","This cap doesn't fit that well, it doesn't come close to feeling like an OEM cap. I went back to OEM. I can't recommend this unless you just need to save a little money. It keeps the gas in the tank, it works. But it feels like it is not quite right for the job."
1,Worst patch panel ever!,"Shame on TrippLite. They took an off brand generic panel and put their name on it. Even with multiple pops of a standard 110 punch tool, the wires won't stay in. There are better alternatives for less money (TrendNet- not great, but it works)."
2,"For a better film about a family tragedy,","I highly recommend you to see ORDINARY PEOPLE. It is ten times better than this mess of a movie called THE GREATEST. I agree with almost everything Roger Ebert said in his review: there was no solid explanation as to why the Carey Mulligan character didn't have anyone else to move into their home except her boyfriend's family, who she didn't even know; there was no way a grief counselor would give advice to someone after hearing only one explanation as to why that person is grieving; and there was no way someone like the Carey Mulligan character would be so self-confident after what she went through. A very unrealistic film."
2,The Greatest just isn't that good,"Directed by Shana Feste, the film tells the story of a family trying to come to terms with the sudden death of their son in a car accident. The process of living though such a horrific event is made even more intense by the sudden announcement by the girl who was in the car with the son on the night he died that she is pregnant with his child.It sounds almost too melodramatic to be anything but the plot of a bad afternoon soap opera, but Feste, who wrote the script, does her best to try and steer clear of the clichÃ©s hidden beneath the surface by adding a lot of warmth and humor to the cold and harsh emotions that are brought out in the family by the tragedy. It's a good idea, but unfortunately, the mix just doesn't work.[...]"
3,Pattern not prominent enough,"I thought the pattern should be more prominent, if you ice it first (as most of the recommended decoration variations show on instructions), you can forget about seeing the pattern to add the details too. I basically freehanded a castle on top of the icing. You need the icing to fill in the flat background and solid column spots or it won't look right. Gave it 3 starts because the actual pan is fine, a good size and the pictures it came with were good enough to be able to freehand the decoration on after the pattern was lost under the icing and had some good variations of ways to decorate. Cheaper though to just make a cake and pipe a castle scene on.....with about the same end result."
3,Hard to see the details,"Some Wilton pans are easier to use than others. This particular shape (the enchanted castle) was a challenge. After the cake had baked and cooled properly, it needed to be frosted with a thin white layer, as do all the decorated cakes. The problem I experienced with this particular design was that once the white frosting had been spread over the entire cake, it was nearly impossible to see the details, such as the windows, roof lines, door, etc. I had to just guess using the pan beside me as a guide. The cake turned out okay, but not nearly as nicely as other cakes made from Wilton pans. The ladybug cake pan was particularly easy to use."
3,Essential If Only For One Track,"Don't be misled. These are 1964-65 recordings Little Richard did for the Vee-Jay label. The songs you recognize are all re-recordings and not the original Specialty hits. What makes this CD worth owning is the Vee-Jay single that should have put Little Richard back on the charts--the soulful ""I Don't Know What You've Got But It's Got Me."" It is perhaps Richard's best vocal performance of his career--it's that good! The song also features an up-and-coming guitarist by the name of Jimi Hendrix. The song spent a week at No. 92; it should've went to No. 1. Buy this and find out what you missed."
4,not a Bad Buy,"overall a nice tent. need to get heavy duty stakes and Better cord.im also going to add sum frame to it. i havnt had to use it during rain yet ( i live in the desert) But it is at least a little water resistant i Believe. the material on the Bottom is heavy duty, the rest is questionaBle. for 25$ its a good Buy i say. if ur on a Budget dont Be afraid to purchase this tent, it will work just fine the way it comes unless ur on sand or in terriBle weather"
2,"Yeah, won't be using that.","I have considerable experience camping and after I read the reviews I thought"" That is an awsome deal!"" So I bought one for a girlfriend. I held my tongue when I realized it is the same style of crap that fell in on me in a rain storm several years ago soaking me and my sleeping bag. We took it camping i encouraged her saying ""we can make it better"". I set up guide lines down the inside and cut holes from them. Then tied ropes from all angles. It can be done. IT worked with a tarp over the top. I wouldn't trust this tent, and don't plan to use it again."
2,"Key word - water ""RESISTANT"" and mildly so at that","Use only if there is no rain in the forecast. In a steady light rain it leaked like a sieve. Not just the seams, everywhere... except the floor of course, which collected the leakage and held it like a kids swimming pool.I bought it for the discrete camo color, and it IS easy to put up and roomy enough for one person plus gear or two people and no gear. I think the ad photo has it right... use it in your backyard, where you can run to the house if it rains.Oh well for $30 what did I expect?Why would anyone manufacture (or buy... DUH) a tent that is not water proof?Anyone know where I can get a ""real"" (water PROOF) tent in cammo?"
4,we are talking 25 bucks folks!,"Texsport falls just short of a ""gotta get it"" tent!At 25 bucks anyone can afford this tent..and it's camo!!I so hate ORANGE and BLUE and YELLOW tents!! They should blend into nature!this one does it and there is room for to inside!PROS: Price, weight, room, ease of assembly. tub bottom will keep you dry.CONS: ventilation is a bit limited..there is a small window on the backend for cross venting, also could be tied out during rain.gettng the the sides tuat will be the project! center sags a bit and may collect water. No rainfly, would not use without one.This is a bug-out-bag tent that anyone can afford. You pay more for a family meal at McDonalds for christsake!get this tent and a rainfly to go over it and walla..your set!view it here:[...]"
3,Good and small,"This tent is easy to set up and take down. It folds up small enough to fit in my backpack. Did I say small? There's just enough room for me and my pack.A few minor gripes: the zippers only have pulls on the outside, which makes getting all three zippers closed tight a challenge; the zippers seem a bit flimsy; there were a lot of loose threads hanging from seams.I'm not sure how this tent will hold up. I've set it up in the back yard a few times, but I'm looking forward to camping with it a lot."
3,Good for the $,"This tent needs a lot of anchor points to stand up to any wind. This is for sure an in the woods tent, so if you have lots of trees around like me you'll be fine. This tent will not work in sand. They could have tripled the poles and kept it hikeable and self supporting but they didn't. You have 2 riser poles and that's it. You need extra rope for sure to set this up. Stakes or ropes to the feet are also needed to make this tent work so rocky ground without a tree to tie to will be difficult. In short make sure you have extra rope and places to triangulate the line to and you'll be fine. I my opinion this makes a great cheater start to a natural shelter so if you have foilage around use it and it will be great. Otherwise spend extra $ to have a tent that self supports. If you are inventive in the wilderness this one is for you. If you drive a subaru and need help to be in nature look on."
2,You Will Get What You Pay For...,"My wife and I bought this tent as a small lightweight, inexpensive backpacking tent. It has several issues that need to be addressed.First: The tent door does not have zippers to close it. Instead, it has only three tie straps. Why they could not add a zipper to the door is beyond me.Second: The rear has a window, but it can only be opened or closed from the outside. This makes it difficult to open up if you want to air out the tent from inside.Third: There is no moisture vent. We woke up to a virtual rainstorm from all the condensation dripping down from the roof. It was pretty frustrating to have to wake up with water dripping on our faces.This tent would be nice for backyard games, or for kids to play with, but don't depend on it for any serious camping."
4,Texsport Camo Tent,This tent is perfect for hiking or taking with you on a fishing trip down the river. I really liked this tent. I had taken my german sheperd along and in the middle of the night he got wrapped around one of the strings you tie on the side of the tent. He ripped it completely in half on that side. I just ordered another one and will try again but this time I will leave the dog chained much farther away from the tent this time. The strings you use to tie the tents sides and metal posts are black. If its dark you will run into them on occasion and take a chance of ripping your tent. Great tent but just be careful with it!
4,Nicer than I thought it would be,This tent is a lot better than I thought it would be for the price. I got it fri took it out sat to break it in and was very pleased. I wasn't to fond of the line but some para cord will fix that problem all the part's were there and in good condition and it was easy to set up.
4,Good for the price but...,"Two people can definitely sleep inside with gear crammed in. Larger than expected. 7 feet long... its a good thing. Some guys shake it off, I step on it. Back to the tent: Two people create major condensation in the tent, so much it rolls down the sides even with the front door open and the back window rolled up all the way.One person may not have this issue.This is a Bug Out Bag must have. Buy better stakes to go with it and its the best 25 bucks you ever spent.I have slept in the tent with my wife 12 times."
4,"Pie Town, Photos, and the use of Propaganda.","This is a fascinating account of a vanished place and attitudes that explores the use of photography to tell a story and create a point of view. This is both a honest unvarnished look at a hard life and an exploration of the manner in which pictures make their own reality. The structure of the book is excellent and the narrow focus on an isolated part of New Mexico expands to shed light on the entire country,"
4,I dog,Really cute. Had a hard time getting batteries in. We lost the instuctions after all the gifts were openend and its not obvious where you need to put batteries.
4,stumped for a Christmas present,I wasn't sure what to get my tween this past Christmas. She didn't ask for iDog but it looked cute in Target commercials. I was surprised it was so small - it looked bigger in television commercials. My tween was surprised and happy to receive iDog since she didn't ask for it. She really likes it and it is cute and a great accessory to her iPod Nano. We just got it for Christmas and had to change batteries within a few weeks - it takes two AA batteries. She thought it had broken and she doesn't use it enough for me to think the batteries were dead but when we changed them it started barking again! I gave it 4 stars because of size and because of the batteries.
4,Colorful and Cute,"The idog is a cute and colorful, but probably isn't worth the money. I really like mine, but don't use it very much. I would be in my room reading, and my MP3 player would be hooked up to my idog playing my music. My MP3 broke, and I got a cell phone/MP3 to replace it. Obviously the phone has its own built in speakers, and so I don't need to hook it up to my idog or other speakers to listen to the music anymore. I used to always have to use my idog to listen to music, but now I just press the ok button, and my music plays. My point is, unless you are looking for some speakers, the idog is for the most part useless. Although you can turn him on and put him close to some other music that is playing, the movement of his head makes a noise, and it isn't that pleasant if the music is playing quietly. The speakers are good on the idog, and the lights work, so if you are looking for a cute, colorful, pricy speaker, go for it!"
2,iDog,"This item is just ok. I feel it is overpriced, maybe at 50% off it would be ok. The sound is mediocre and he may/may not dance with the music. My 10 year old likes it though."
3,"Cute, but get a screwdriver and batteries ready","This little pup is totally cute!! It's got a lot of personality and the light show matches the music. My daughter and I both enjoy using it. The reason for my low rating though is the battery usage. For one thing, there's a little tiny philips screw that needs to be removed to get to the batteries. That gets really old when you need to change them a lot. I brought the pooch to work one day and the batteries ran out shortly after lunch time.If you aren't a ""power"" user, I would definitely recommend this, but if you are looking to get a little more play time, look elsewhere."
3,"""Kinda"" Cute","IDog is kinda cute, but not so sure worth the price. He's very colorful, but the interaction in movements is dull. When you turn him off, he's gets a little upset with a cute little growl, that's my daughters' favorite part."
3,pink hasbro i-dog,"my daughter had to have one for christmas. its cute and amusing, however the amusement is gone now. i think its one of those things that once you use it for a couple of hours, theres nothing new that it does so it gets boring."
1,Beware!,I bought this dog for my daughter for christmas. she tried it in her 2nd generation nano and it froze up immediately and then went dead. we had to return her nano and get a new one which luckily we had just bought and could still return it. I know when new ipods come out they often have compatibility issues with some products and this was definitely one of them. I wanted to make sure people know there is a chance they may ruin their ipod and use caution if purchasing this dog for use with 2nd generation nanos...
4,I Dog,"This product is easy to use - an important feature when considering a gift for a young child. Although the reproduced sound is not of a particularly high quality, the i-dog is fun to watch as its lights flash and its ears wag!It is comical to hear the dog call to you when you're in a different room and beg for attention. My daughter loves this toy; she laughs with it and even gets mad at it when it doesn't stop whining for attention!"
2,Too confusing to figure out,"Am I the only one out here who can't get an i-Dog to work. it will work for the first time and once you turn the music off, it doesn't come back on. We've tried two of them. We must be doing something wrong."
1,Agravating,This was a gift for my daughter. She did not like it. It kept making noise. She said it is very agravating.
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"The Hasbro Dog is visually appealing but I found that it has very limited features. It does nod its head back and forth occasionally, when listening to music but not enough to keep you interested. Also, the light display is subpar and to be blunt....boring."
2,Bad dog,"Well, this little fella certainly does love music. In fact, I barely got him out of the box before he began obsessively organizing my record collection by genre, subgenre, year of issue, and suitability for mix-tape inclusion.However, hindsight being 20/20, I wish I'd spent the few extra bucks to get him the optional headphones. This little guy has an unaccountable taste for Joy Division, C & C Music Factory, and the Smiths. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but frankly I'm wishing he'd mix it up a little.Also, housebreaking is a real chore. The only thing worse than having to clean up nasty little piles of stinky transistors is having to clean up nasty little piles of stinky transistors while listening to ""Hand in Glove"" for like the millionth freaking time."
3,Not that impressed,"I was under the assumption that it recoreded the music it heard and could replay it. I'm returning it today.Oh, AND it was really greasy when I got it, like if it was used already, and I didn't order a used one.I bought these for my neices for Christmas and now I have no clue what to get them."
3,"OK intro text, poor as a reference","I give this text 3 stars, because even though it is easy to read, it falls short of both categories that make any textbook useful: It is neither a great introductory text on the material, nor an outstanding reference for those with a good handle on estimation theory.I used this book last semester for a graduate controls course on state estimation, and found the examples easy to read, but rather disjointed when considered as a whole. The introductory material on probability theory was incomplete, and I found that I was constantly turning to Gelb and to Mendel's ""Lessons in Estimation Theory.."" to get the full picture. The book also gives little treatment to modeling, which is paramount to building an effective controller.The book does have it's merits: In addition to the typical derivation of the Kalman Filter, it provides an alternate derivation for the filter when all you have are the noisy measurements. This is a useful derivation for practical applications."
2,Lacking explanations as a textbook,"I am trying to learn the subject by reading this and Gelb. Even though this book covers a lot of introductory concepts, it is lacking proper derivation of equations that I usually see in most math and physics textbooks. I find this book very disappointing for its price."
2,"Kalman filters, Brown & Hwang vs. Gelb","This is not my favorite text on Kalman filters. I find there is too much emphasis on elementary, preliminary material, and not enough on application.I teach the subject out of my own notes (draft book) where the development follows that of Gelb, Applied Optimal Estimation, and all of the computations are done in Matlab. I first read Kalman's original papers in great detail, and rederived his work before the Gelb book (MIT Press, 1974) was published. Since the advdent of Matlab (1984) I have continued to used Gelb's derivations, and augmented that work with extensive Matlab examples.I still find Gelb more usable as a text than other, newer books, and will continue to use it along with my Matlab supplements."
5,Christmas Classic,The BEST Christmas movie EVER!!-All the newer versions can NEVER compete with the original 1947 version-only one word is needed-GREAT!!!!!
5,Great Classic,I enjoyed the service and the movie. I plan to show it in my high school classes next week a great movie
4,Wonderful heartwarming film.,"I love this movie it's a perenial fav.... the movie quality itself on the authentic black and white version was a bit ""iffy"". But all in all a fine movie."
4,A true Christmas classic,This movie is very touching. Definitely an old classic. Has a fantastic message--not about Santa its about Christmas spirit and how if makes people act. Good and nice! Maybe more people ought to watch to be reminded what Christmas really means. This was the first time I have seen it and will be watching it again.
3,Miracle on 34th Not Colorized?,This Blu-ray also states on the package of the disc itself that it has both the colorized version AND the black and white. I am not a fan of colorized films by any means but was curious to see what it would look like. I cannot find the colorized version anywhere on the disc so if that is a concern for buying it don't worry about it.
1,Blu ray Miracle on 34th Street is a BUST,"I have a collection of over 1000 DVDs and Blu rays.I'm trying to switch over to Blu ray when i can. I have found that the older movies are magnificent on Blu ray. Casablanca, Ben Hur, the 10 Commandments etc. are all wonderful, Blu ray brings out the best in films except for Miracle on 34Th Street. I just viewed it and it looks like i was watching a VHS film. It was dark, brownish and not pleasant to watch. I recommend buying the DVD and leaving the Blu ray alone as far as this movie goes. Its to bad, i was looking forward to something much better."
5,I believe in Santa Claus,"Like many households, for me Christmas movies are as much a part of the tradition as trees and presents. ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""White Christmas,"" ""A Christmas Carol"" the Rankin/Bass Animagics and ""Miracle on 34th Street."" This Holiday classic is a nice DVD, with good quality and restored black and white. The bonus features are slim to none, containing only a movie trailer and a talent file.With Ed Gwen and Natalie Woods playing both sides of the coin, ""Miracle on 34th Street"" is a film of charming, wide-eyed cynicism. What place does Santa Claus have in the modern world? What place does belief and trust have in a world where Santa shows up to work drunk and Christmas is a headache to every retail and postal worker in America?Gimbels may be long gone, but I am glad that ""Miracle on 34th Street"" has persisted. Perhaps the message of the film has more staying power than the corporations that would commandeer Christmas.Like Mr. Macy says, ""You cannot argue with success."""
5,The Best Santa Movie Ever,"I love this movie and wouldn't have Christmas pass by without watching it. The casting of ALL the characters is perfect, and the acting is first rate. I can't see how any part of this movie could be improved upon. The best Santa movie ever made."
1,Dont Buy,This is a horrible Blu-rayIts says color - No ColorIts not even full screen...Im returning via false advertising
4,Another classic,"This is another classic movie of which I have more than one version. I do enjoy this version's ""Kris Kringle"" very much and Natalie Wood was fantastic as Susan. Maureen O'Hara made a great mother and the story speaks for itself, if you believe. . . ."
5,Heart warming.,Watched the color version by mistake. Will watch the classic black and white next Christmas; Great movie to add to my collection.
5,Classic,Great classic movie for the holidays! I would recommend this movie highly. By far one of the best Christmas story of all time.
5,Lovable Classic!,"Quality and price were both exceptional! A lovable, timeless classic my family and I always enjoy year after year. A perfect way to kick off the holiday season!"
3,WATCH OUT! - This is NOT COLORIZED,"Amazon's SAY'S the disk also comes Colorized WRONG! ! !NO COLORIZED version on this disk. If you liked the colorized version then buy the DVD, it has BOTH!As to the blu-ray, it has a bit more grain than the DVD Seems OK but for $21.00 I may prefer the DVD.Shame on FOX double dipping again."
5,Value-for-Money,"I have another version of this movie in LD. I like the story very much and its idea of using the Post Office to prove officially the existence of the Santa is so much better than the 1994 remake. This edition provides the best of both world (Colour and B/W)for me as well. All in all, it is a great value package for a young at heart."
4,My Review,"This movie is a classical to watch. I got this as a gift for my Mom. For those who haven't seen it, I suggest that you do. You will like it."
5,I love this version of a classic tale!,"I watch this movie every holiday season and will definitely be adding it to my DVD collection. I think they updated it wonderfully, and it touches my heart. Good performances all around, especially Mara Wilson."
5,I believe!!!,"""Miracle"" is a must-see every Christmas. Everyone who has ever believed in Santa will appreciate this endearing classic."
5,This is~~by far~~The Best Christmas Movie Ever,"What a set of movies! I have searched for years to find the colorized version of the Original ""Miracle on 34th Street"". I couldn't find it anywhere. I love the black-and-white version, too. This great set has BOTH. I've enjoyed it throughout the season and lent it out to friends for their viewing pleasure and will do that again for years to come. Best buy I have ever made online and Amazon makes the purchase so easy anymore. The remake is a good try - but - you cannot beat this original version of this great movie."
5,Rx - - - Revisit Annually,"Unless you live under a rock, you have seen this annual favorite every Christmas. A wonderful heartwarming story to rekindle the tiniest doubter about faith and goodwill. Kris Kringle (Santa Claus) goes on trial to prove his sanity after a run in with a Macy's store psychiatrist and has to prove to the world who he is. Events will make you laugh and even cry as you feel the government come to his rescue and little Suzy's (Natalie Wood) coming of age. See the movie!!!"
5,This is my favorite holiday movie,"Many years ago I was working at Macy's over the Christmas holidays. I was stationed near the gift wrapping area where this film was on continuous loop. I must have seen certain scenes from it 70 times. I can still hear the young janitor advising Chris to ""Throw it on the floor - I get awfully tired of sweeping up dust."" At the end of the holiday season, I had to aquire the film in order to watch it all the way through. And we still watch it every year."
5,movie review,This movie was very fun and great to watch for the holidays. Our family will be watching it as a traditon each christmas eve
4,Heartfelt,A classic holiday movie like this is a nice addition for those who celebrate Christmas. We watch is every year and always look forward to it.
5,i love it,wouldnt have a Christmas without seeing it. it's always a pleasure to see Natalie wood especially.its a classic! Everyone should own it.
2,"Jacket says it is colorized, IT IS NOT!",This product was not what it says it is. The jacket cover says it is a colorized version and it is black and white. I don't appreciate the misrepresentation on this product. There is not a selection on the disc for a colorized version. I have already checked out all the features and there is not a colorized selection. I really wanted the colorized version. I tried to call customer service and they said there was not a colorized available. So why does it say it is colorized on the jacket?
1,mirepresentation,I love this movie but i never would have boughten a black and white blu ray. I feel the package represents a color version of the holiday package. The entire movie is b&w
2,Save your money if you have the DVD,"I was disappointed in the quality of the video transfer. Keep the DVD if you have it, and save money. The movie itself is top rate Christmas fare."
5,Great Value for a classic,You can't go wrong with the original 1947 black & white and the colorized version all in one set. Along with many special features.
5,Great Christmas Movie,OK Let me start off by saying this is a Great Classic Christmas Movie. Now the BR is misleading as some People claim it contains both the B&W as well as the Colorized versions of this film. This BR disc does not it only contains the B&W version. The colorized version is not on BR.
3,Santa on Trial,"'Miracle on 34th Street' is still an enduring holiday movie. There is a lot of novelty to draw upon. A man from a nursing home takes over the Santa helm at Macy's Department store and has all the charm and warmth to replace his drunken predecessor in a pinch. He's liked well enough until he takes the role seriously enough to proclaim he is 'the' Santa Claus and even writes it on his job form. Although endearing, he alarms his employer who objects when he insists to his daughter (Natalie Wood, who looks the same when she's grown up, only smaller) that Santa is the real and he's the real McCoy. The cynical won't have it, and Macy's psychiatrist and a local politician behind the judge (William Frawley, later Fred of 'I Love Lucy' fame) analyse the situation until it becomes a ticklish affair among the press. With some realistic acting by key players and a fun premise that is both fanciful and true-to-life, 'Miracle on 34th Street' is believable enough to keep us all going."
1,Blu-ray in full screen??,"I was thoroughly disappointed with this version. I never would have expected a Blu-ray of such a classic to be available in full-screen. I am supplying this commentary for those like me who wouldn't have this expectation. Just so you are prepared to receive a partial movie, some call this a pan and scan version."
5,Another Christmas Classic!,"Want to get into the mood for the upcoming holiday? Well, it's always helpful when you watch these classic Christmas films. A majority of them are always fun to watch, like It's a Wonderful Life and Home Alone. The original 1947 version of Miracle on 34th Street may not be perfect, but it still manages to bring that warm holiday spirit by asking the question: Is the Santa Claus for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day real or not? It's such a heartwarming film, and anyone can enjoy it, whether you celebrate Christmas or not."
5,I Can Set it Again and Again and Again and...,"One of my favorite holiday films of all time. Especially, since I worked in Macy's the first time I saw it and was very familiar with a lot of the interior scenes including the employee locker area.The scene where the judge is buried by the Santa mail is priceless! Hard to believe that the girl was a young Natalie Wood."
2,Blu-ray not as good as DVD,"I was very disappointed with the Blu-ray version of this movie. There is an annoying graininess throughout the film. When I compared it to the 2-disc DVD set we already owned, the DVD was noticeably cleaner and more pleasing to the eye. I guess I would be tempted to assume that this is just an inherent problem with Blu-ray in that it's just so clear that it brings out the grains in the original film, but I also ordered the Blu-ray version of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", and it looks great. This is a classic holiday film, but if you want the best quality version, get the 2 DVD set."
5,Best Christmas movie of all time,This is my favorite Christmas movie of all time. My husband and I look forward to watching it together every year. It is truly a classic.
5,Essential Christmas Movies,"There are three Christmas movies That I consider ""essential"" (1947) at The Christmas holidays. ""Miracle on 34th Street"" Is the first of these along with ""It's a wonderful life and almost any version of ""A Christmas carol"" There are many others I like and watch. However, these three always make me feel the gift of giving, love and peace in my heart.Miracle on 34th Street also reminds me that at one time when I was young people still cared about their fellow man if only at Christmas time. It is my all time feel good movie."
5,Miracle on 34th Street,"I HAD to add this Movie to my Library. I enjoy this movie every time I see it. I loved that this ""First"" Miracle on 34th Street is colorized. It was hard to make out some of the details in just Black & White. I love to see Natalie Wood as a Child and all the Actors are so believable. Watching this movie is a real tradition at Christmas Time for me. I think this Original Miracle on 34th Street is better than the ""re-make"" of the same story."
3,deceiving info...,"I just purchased the Blu-ray disc of Miracle on 34th Street. The description claims it is colorized yet the film is in the original black and white. That is fine with me personally, but to those who might buy this desiring the colorized version this will likely be upsetting. There is no option to view the film in color and the description is downright false. Anyone who wants to see a blu-ray color version of this classic...this is not it."
5,"Great Movie, Worst Screen Kiss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This was a great movie. I have watched it numerous times over the years.However, it has the worst screen kiss. This kiss takes place in the final scene, just as the picture ends.It is between Maureen O'Hara and John Payne.The first time I saw the movie, when I saw this kiss, I was startled at the way the kiss was acted out. It was to harsh and without finesse, and lacked any romantic appeal for this type of movie. He pressed her mouth so hard, it made lines on the side of her face. It certainly was not the type of kiss that matched this type of movie."
4,A fun original family classic,"I have to say I have seen the remake more times then this one but I like this one just as much. i like the acting,story and the directing. The problem is Susie I found her to be a spoiled brat. the story is cute as a girl dosnet believe in Santa Clause and a man says he's the real thing. the good thing about this movie is we dont know if he's the real thing becouse all the stuff he dose can be done. The movie is a fun original classic holiday film."
1,Misleading picture,"I bought this in Blue Ray thinking by justing looking at the Color front of the DVD and it is in Color soI.m thinking that it is , but it is in Black and White. Now tell me who would want a DVD in Blue Ray in Black and White. Highly Disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!would like a return but it would probably cost more to returned that what it is worth..........Lillllly42@aol.com"
3,Colorized Version Nice to Watch but prefer B/W Version,The colorized version is nice to watch but the colors are a little too bright; probably because of the lighting techniques employed for the B/W master copy. The colorization is better than the earlier attempts in that the gray halo is not apparent around the object as in the earlier attempts.
5,Great Movie,I love this movie! And I was surprised this package included both color version and black and white version. Good job.
5,My 2nd favorite Christmas movie of all time!,"I love this movie, it was definitely worth the $2 or whatever it cost to rent it from Amazon for a couple days!"
1,Great movie lousy Blu-Ray,"Great movie but I was extremely disappointed in this supposedly Blu-Ray edition. It isn't even close to HD let alone Blu-ray quality. Looks like a regular ""small screen"" dvd (that's right it isn't widescreen) and has only the black & white version unlike many other quality blu-ray editions of classic movies that have both the BW and color versions.So do yourself a favor and don't waste you money on this ""blu-ray"" version."
1,no sound,"Part way through the movie the sound stops working, tried everything on the TV first and switched TVs but still does not work."
1,It's in Black and White,"I thought I was getting a color version because of the packaging, but it is Black and White. This Black and White DVD is hardly any better than the Black and White DVD version I own. I was totally bummed to have wasted my money on the Black and White. I've never been a fan of Black and White - COLOR IS BETTER!!!I of course love the movie -- always have - watch it at least 3 times every Christmas. Love all the characters and I almost believed there was a Santa Claus."
3,"Santa or not, I am not a cynic but was bored","Santa or not, I am not a cynic but was bored. Good actors though. I am not going to see this movie a second time if i can help it."
5,A Classic,"This is a classic film with a great cast, the likes ofwhich we will never see again. This version is far betterin every way than any of the cheesy, poorly cast remakes.If you want to see a great film like this one, stick tothe original and skip the poorly done, politically correctremakes."
5,"Great movie, good Blu-ray","Amazon still has the wrong information about this Blu-ray, which they claim to be in color. I received it yesterday and am happy to report that it is only in black and white. I deleted my previous ""review"", in which I was concerned that this Blu-ray might be color only.I rate the movie as a 5/5 but the Blu-ray picture is not as sharp as I had wished. I still gave the product a 5/5 because I think this is the best presentation this movie will ever be because of the age of the movie. It beats the DVD, which is enough to prompt me to buy the Blu-ray. It is also possible that the original film was shot with soft focus."
3,Nice picture but no color version...,I got this as a gift for my wife and assumed it had the color version too. I obviously should have read the reviews. She loves the movie itself though and the black and white picture looked great so I still gave it a 3. I think she returned it and got the DVD with both versions of the film on it though. Oh well...
4,"Great story, but cover misleading","The story is a classic and this original is one of the best. However, as a Blu-ray we expected a bit more. First, the cover shows the colorized version of the movie. We expected to get both, you only get the black and white version. In fact, that is all you get. Hardly worth the blu-ray disk storage."
2,I hesitate to buy the dvd,"I hestitate to buy this dvd because I bought the vhs thinking i was getting the original theatrical release. I didn't. I got the version I see on TNT every Thanksgiving. The version that is cut up from years past. People always write that the part they love is when Maureen O'Hara and John Payne find Kris's cane by the fire place in the house for sale. For me the part that makes the movie is always cut. Tommy Mera is just done with his testimony in court and asks Kris on his way out of court for an offical football helmut and Kris says OK. After the happy resolution of the trail Maureen O'Hara ask Kris to dinner party, but Kris says it is Christmas Eve. The next scene should be the Mera house Christmas morning and Tommy getting his football helmut and mom and dad saying I didn't get it while Tommy is wearing this over sized football helmut. Until I see a completely restored version I will not buy the dvd."
3,"Blu-Ray single disk release Oct 9, 2009 rating","No colorized version! Is this another double-dip version Blu-ray? TheMiracle on 34th Street (Special Edition) on DVD was on 2 disks, with B&W; and a new and beautiful colorized version. A well done DVD release.This blu-ray only has the B&W; version. I would WAIT for the Miracle on 34th Street (Special Edition)Blu-ray version release down the road...(2010?) that will have BOTH the B&W; and color version.Movie = 5+ starsBlu-ray single disk = 1 stars"
1,Very Disappointed.,"I received a colorized version of the movie. There was a black & white scene from the movie, depicted in the description and NOWHERE did it say it was a colorized version. This is the first time Amazon disappointed me."
2,poor video quality,"Unfortunately in the case of Miracle on 34th Street, the higher resolution of Blu-ray translates into an overly contrasty image with a lot of noise (I mean a lot of noise) It is a shame that such a classic movie was not properly remastered. The image quality, to my eye almost unwatchable. The softer image of the dvd version is a little better. The standard for quality Blu-ray black and white reissue of a classic movie is Casa Blanca. This is an example of the kind of result possible when people actually care about quality."
5,Christmas DVD,"Love it, have watched it twice so far, replacing all VCR tapes with new DVD's. Should bring years of enjoyment to our home."
5,Very Satisfying!,"This is a great compilation of magic, madness, culture and creativity. All of the stories were pretty satisfying, some of them terrifying! There are some writers here that are going to go places. Watch for the authors of the two longest pieces, Nnedi Okorafor (her story is called Crossroads) and James S. Dorr (he wrote a story called Madness)."
2,Better luck next time,"The first time I listened to this album, I liked it okay. Every time since, my opinion has gone downhill. The singing is forced and rather grating, reducing my enjoyment to the instrumental songs (""Rusty Nail"" and ""Dusty Wine Bottle"" the best of the batch). However, even those are not top quality -- such frenetic playing could be better executed. Kila needs more practice and refinement. This one gets a thumbs-down as ""bad date music."""
2,FAS,"This is a good book if you don't know much about FAS. It would have been more helpful for me to read 3 years ago when I first adopted my 3 daughters from Ukraine. At the time the first Dr. didn't think that they had FAS, but after about 9 months, I read the symptoms and felt like they did. Anyway, hopefully pregnant women would read it and understand the effects of alcohol on pregnancy!"
3,Eh..,It wasn't the roomiest duffle bags I have ever owned. The color is right on. It's pastel pink. It got the job done but not worth the money.
3,Partial DVD workaround,"I just got my CD/DVD, and like everyone else, was disappointed that the DVD would not play. Luckily I did not delete the BBC concert from my DVR (it was broadcast several weeks ago and I taped it.)For those who want to watch the DVD, the freeware VLC media player will play it just fine on your PC. Download VLC from http://www.videolan.org/vlc/. It is a small file and easy install. I realize this is not as good as watching it on your TV, but it is better than nothing while we wait to see what Amazon and Atlantic are going to do for us."
1,DVD won't play,"Now you tell me. I was so excited about watching the DVD but mine won't play either. I have never heard of such a thing as only playing in certain regions. That is crazy. I see another person had the same problem. The CD is great, but I really want to be able to watch the DVD!!!!!!!"
3,"US fans, beware - DVD will not play in your Region One DVD player.","The audio CD in this set was awesome. James Blunt is an amazing performer and his voice and his lyrics are something the music world is sorely lacking these days. Unfortunately I can't give the set anymore than 3 stars as I was only able to use half of it.If you live in the US, please don't buy this set if you plan on watching the DVD (unless you have a player that will play all regions). While the listing says it's Region 0 (which should work in all regions), the copy I received was Region 2,3,4,5. No Region 1 validity. What a disappointment!"
5,This DVD/CD shows James Blunt is for Real!,"Highly recommended! Part of my personal collection; as I am a very discerning fan that only 'buys' CDs and/or DVDs from 8 artists, of which James Blunt is one!"
4,Great Product...,"Great product, if you love James Blunt you will love this DVD... only problem is that it won't play on my dvd player BUT I can play it on my dvd player on my laptop..."
5,US customers cannot purchase from amazon.co.uk,"I haven't bought this yet, but I'm sure I'll love it. Just wanted to give a heads-up that I tried the amazon.co.uk site as a customer suggested. Not sure if they left that comment for UK citizens only, however they ship to UK address only, not US."
1,A Sad Day In New York,"I have an invalid friend who lives on the 10th floor of an apartment a block from where the Twin Towers once stood. On 9/11 he was a dust covered refugee sent by barge to New Jersey and he was unable to return to his apartment for over 2 months. He saw James Blunt on TV and wanted to obtain his new DVD. He doesn't own a computer and so I ordered the CD and DVD from Amazon, had them sent to him in New York and billed to his American Express card. Amazon was super prompt with the shipment. Tracking was fine. However, he just phoned to tell me that he can't view video on the DVD received, only hear its audio content. After reading other reviews concerning this item I can understand why. The CD is OK, but it was really the DVD which he wanted. Amazon sure disappointed him by sending a DVD that won't work in the U.S."
1,Not positive,"This book demonstrates the anger the editor and publisher has towards the Faith. He is at odds with its institutions and this book and another of his books by Dr. Cole, are designed to divide the friends and to put the faith in a negative light. Save your money."
4,A racist text,"This racist text glorifies slavery and acts as an appology for the role of Islam in African slaving, trying to gloss over a hurendous 1400 year period by pretending that all slaves played pivotal role in Islam and that they manifested quick conversions and therefor were happy and loved, and treated as equals. The fact remains despite all the pretending is that these people were slaves, to be bought and sold as meat and used as the masters pleased, frequently being raped and beaten. But you wont find these stories here.Seth J. Frantzman"
5,"A brilliant analysis of key 19th century thinkers who paved the way for aggressive neo-atheism,","De Lubac's anlaysis of Feuerbach, Nietzsche, Comte and Marx illusrates that ""where there is no God, there is no Man either"" and that postitivism, marxism and variant philosophies, in seeking to model a new man, agressively independent of God, result in a nihilistic tyranny of man over man. Its De Lubac's sympathetic handling of these lunatic ideas and their exponents, Nietzsche,in particular (who de Lubac sees as haunted by Christ), which gives the book balance. If you wish to understand why we are living in an age where atheism has become more militant and aggressve, then De Lubac's book make you realise that what we are experiencing now is the culmination of many centuries of alienation of western thought from the Logos, who unites all things in himself. His treatment of Dostoevsky (a counterbalance to the other thinkers) is particularly illuminating."
1,vastu not Indian feng sui,"""The study of the Shastras is meant only for the instruction of disciples. No knowledge nor even part of knowledge can be conveyed in an abridged form."" (Shilpa Prakasa, Second Prakasa, v. 800 referring to Vaastu and Shilpa Shastras)First, the title is completely misleading. Vaastu is not Indian feng sui. it has nothing to do with moving furniture, using yantras, or correcting existing non compliant homes or buildings. Vastu or Vaastu is guided by a specific set of texts called Vaastu Shastras. There is almost nothing in the 32 vaastu shastras cited by the author. Contemporary people have attempted to take a very specific science of architecture and debase it for false profits."
4,A sumptuous jungle boat ride!,"Les Baxter always got less attention that quasi-competitor Martin Denny, but I find his orchestrations peppier, indeed a bit campier, but more colorful and much more fun. ""Tamboo"" isn't quite as wonderful as Baxter's ""Ritual of the Savage""(which I found as an import), but it picks up after the first few tracks and has some brilliantly mad, sparkling moments of manic taboo, a collage of primitive sounds that will put you in the heart of the Amazon(or Disney's Jungle Cruise ride, take your pick). ""Skins"" is a somewhat more intimate album, but has just as many pleasures. Also, the cover art is worth the price alone. Fabulous stuff for bachelor and bachelorette pads."
3,Tamboo vs. Muzak,"Idly perusing Amazon's pages led me to the music that I had thought so passionate in 1957. I ordered Tamboo and discovered that 50 years later the music was pale, colorless. The music hasn't changed, of course, but time has moved on. What was avante garde then is relegated to the ordinary now. Still, Tamboo is a great listen for gentle background along with some reminiscing!"
4,TWO OF THE BEST,"TWO OF THE BEST LES BAXTER EXOTICA/LOUNG MUSIC RECORDS RELEASED IN THE 1950'S- EARLY 1960'S. YOU WILL WANT TO SIT BACK WITH AN EXOTIC COCKTAIL (THE KIND WITH AN TINY UMBRELLA STICKING OUT OF THE TOP) WHEN YO UHEAR THIS MUSIC. TRULY ORIGINAL FOR ITS' TIME, EVEN THOUGH IT MAY SOUND DATED TODAY. BUT THE GREAT RECORDING SOUND AND RE-MIXING MAKE IT WORTH IT."
1,Over Priced,"Both of the books recently purchased are not worth the price. Gazebos and Trellises was sadly missing detail found in far cheaper books published by Dover Books. Sadly, I will probably not trust Amazon again in always representing good value."
2,Valuable for some,"The first publication of this was in French in the 1920s so a modern post-Chaplain American artist looking for a silent theatre resource may be a bit dissapointed. The book is unofficially broken up into two parts: a detail description of facial, hand, and body gestures which can be used as templates for communicating and the author's advice on how to approach the creation of new Pantomimes. The book is a good study in Pantomime, a particular type of wordless narrative derived from commedia dell'arte, but not about wordless / silent theater in general."
2,An Unbiased Review,"John Antonelli's five star review praises this book for saying ""things about Arlington County that everybody knows and no one wants to say,"" adding that ""Pastorelli is my favorite character."" What Mr. Antonelli fails to disclose here --- but readily admits elsewhere --- is that he was the model for the Pastorelli character. Not quite an unbiased reviewer, in my humble opinion. Moreover, as the book's author readily concedes, this work of fiction bears little resemblance to the real world of Arlington politics. Anyone trying to understand Arlington County by reading this book would be better off trying to drive around Atlanta using a London roadmap. That being said, this little book is a pleasant beach or pool side read despite the author's annoying penchant for changing some --- but not all --- of the names of the County's roads, neighborhoods and landmarks."
2,Cheap but not usable long term,"I needed to create a long CAT5 cable and had previously purchased a similar connector at Lowe's (manufacturer was RCA) for $7. That connector worked ok, so I bought a bunch of these to keep on hand for when I needed them. The throughput on a cable connected by one of them was only about 1.4Mb, and the connection seems somewhat looser. The price was great, but the functionality and quality is really lacking. Spend the extra money on a reputable brand connector or longer CAT5 cable."
3,old-skool gabba,"First off, the tracklisting is all wrong, even in the one included with the CD booklet. This is the US edition of a UK double album, which included on the first CD an unmixed compilation of Deathchant tracks (H&P's label in the UK) from 1994 to 2000, and on the second CD a mix of more recent tracks. The tracklisting included on the US version is from the second UK CD (the mix), but in fact, the music on the US cd is from the unmixed compilation (UK CD1). I haven't heard the mix CD, but this compilation souds dated in most tracks, and it's not really interesting to listen to when not on a dancefloor. Track 5, though, is really excellent, but then again, I'm not extremely familiar with UK hardcore techno."
4,I loved it,"This hardcore CD is very good. It's got great breaks and beats in the beginning, middle, and end. And, you get what you pay for, it's almost filled to the brim with great songs. I recomend it a lot."
3,furemover review,"It came in reasonable time. The product itself works okay at removing cat fur, but there are other products that work much better like the tape roller, and also the red cloth material used for fur removal."
2,Disappointing,These brushes don't pick up very much hair on my dog.Golden retriever. The regular metallic brush works better.
5,extra bargain-best hair remover,"I have another one of the small brushes and it works the best at removing dog hair from fleece and other clothes prior to washing in a front-load washer. Just luv it!! So, I thought I would try the set because of the combo price. Big brush is even better at getting rid of hair. I don't use the mitt so much; tried it once and seems to work well. Worth it because of the two brushes...absolutely! No more wasting money on tape rollers and if it gets dirty, wash with a little dish soap and water (so I guess it is ""green"")."
2,doesn't work well,"These brushes don't pick up hair well from any type of fabric. They brush my dog ok, but don't pull a lot of hair from him either."
1,"Payed for three, plus ridiculously much for the shipment and received only two of the listed items.","I payed for three, received only two of the listed items!!The packaging was way too big and the shipment much to expensive for having to pick it up at the post office.Not a happy customer."
1,Horrible customer service,"I recieved one of the three items that I had ordered in a timely manner. I emailed the company regarding the other two items, and got no response. I left negative feedback on amazon over two weeks ago, they told me that they would send me the remaining items from my order, so I removed the feedback. More than two weeks later...nothing. I will not order from Daves Tool Shed again."
4,want to lose a lot of weight and get ripped?,"A bit dated in terms of the pictures and very basic info, Steve does a great job of motivating the reader to get and stay fit by power walking. If the internet in its commercial form had been available when this book was written, Steve would have started a power walking revolution!It is not a book about olympic style speed walking but rather a book for a lifestyle change. I applaud the author, as he was ahead of his time. It might be in print again; if so, get it!"
5,Emotional baroque!!,"What a fabulous recording! When I bought this CD, I was afraid that the Rosenkranz Sonaten would be sterile exercises in baroque violin technique. Was I wrong! Letzbor plays each of the sonatas with charismatic emotion and vitality. I can finally relate each of the sonatas to its proper station on the rosary! There is not a dull moment in this recording. Since Letzbor tunes his instrument differently for each sonata, the timbres change from work to work. The recorded sound is great, having much resonance in both the instrument and the venue. The other instruments provide fantastic basso continuo--not too light, but they do not overshadow the star of the show. I listen to this recording far more often than I expected I would."
2,Not his best,"I LOVE trance and believe Christopher Lawrence to be one of the top trance DJ's around. Just to give you an idea of where I'm coming from, I think his best album is RISE, followed by TEMPTATION. However, TRILOGY PART ONE: EMPIRE seems more similar to his HOOK RECORDINGS compilation, in which the songs are very mechanical and are driven forward by uninteresting noise. I like hard trance, but I like layers and, god forbid, a catchy, memorable ""melody"" that I can play in my head after listening to the CD - no such luck on this CD - boring, homogenous track selection."
5,My Favorite!!!!,"This was the first Christopher Lawrence album I bought and I love it!!! By the first 3 tracks, I was hooked. A few of them when I heard them for the first time I wouldn't have liked, but after listening through the whole album, they kinda grew on me. This album has prompted me to buy further albums of his. This is a great album to get you pumped up when on your way to work."
3,No temptation,After buying Christopher Lawrence's Temptation mix i had great expectation for Trilogy part one. Unfortunately I was disappointed. Unlike Temptation most of the tunes are repetative and lack that catchy hard trance sound. If you really want to hear Lawrence's best work stay away from Trilogy and buy Temptation!
5,This is what rock and roll should be,"If you think it isn't rock and roll unless it has a horns section these guys are for you. Furious punk energy, band funky horns, rock grooves and modern recording quality all in one. Highly recommended to anyone who likes rock."
2,Not Enough Elvira,"The reason this VHS is receiving only 2* is because Elvira only introduces the flick and then never appears again. I have this Roger Corman ""masterpiece"" on DVD and it is worth a 2* rating. If you are into Roger Corman, it would get 4*. 2* here because I was very disappointed Elvira was only in it for a couple of minutes. If you are purchasing this movie for Elvira purposes, Buyer beware!!!"
2,Lacklustre CD Looked Good on Paper,"Sabri Khan is an outstanding musician, one of the best sarangiyas in the world easily, and this disc looked so good on paper. 53 minutes of raga ""Saugandh""* (is this a classic or what? ;), recorded live with an Indian audience, which can be heard cheering him on the Indian way: ""vah""; ""wah!"" If you've heard such classics as Begum Akthar live in Bombay 1957, you know the kind of feeling such recordings can pack, when the performer delivers the goods and the audience goes wild and fills the air with sounds of appreciation. Unfortunately, Khansaheb seems to have had a rather uninspired day this time, and the audience finds few twists and turns to cheer at. The same label has another recording of Sabri Khan, Art of the Indian Sarangi, which is better, I think, where he plays raga Jog. *) In all fairness, there is also a 16-minute thumri filler piece."
3,Not exactly as pictured,"It works fine, but the connectors a open and U-shaped, not closed loops. I would have preferred the closed loop kind and probably would have bought a different product if the picture was an accurate portrayal of the product.Note to seller: Fix the picture and I'll upgrade my review to 5 stars."
4,"Much Better Quality than the Pro 13, especially if Used Often","I have been through a few of the pro 13 guns which usually cease and this gun is clearly a much higher quality and has a removable tip that can be replaced. Lined with teflon, there is far less risk of foam curing in the gun, better bead control (turns in ""clicks"" for precise changes in bead size, overall feels much more rugged than pro 13 gun. I personally use this in the pest control field and it is a useful tool for excluding pests from your home as well as insulating."
3,Ok but there are better ones out there.,The pro model 14 was my first foam gun and I've had it a few months now but the black narrow tips they give you are cheap and don't last that long. They should make a metal one like OSI does for their gun. I am all out of black plastic narrow tips and you can't buy them. The gun is starting to have less flow even when cleaned out properly. Buy the OSI gun.
1,Defected gun,I bought this gun and out of the box first time it leaked at the seal. I am returning it. I went to Homedepot and got a new one works great. It cost me 2 cans of cleaner to return it too. will not buy on line.
4,Cruising made simple!,Roger & Susie have made cruising to the Bahamas look easy and simple. This book has paid special attention to every detail and is well worth the few bucks it cost.If you are planning this type of a cruise or just read about their adventures it worth every penny and more. Maybe we should send Roger & Susie some money for writing the book too!
4,Tailgate Toss,"I thought the price was high, but bought it anyway for my big Montana fan because he wanted it. You have to put the stickers on yourself. Would be nice if you could just buy the stickers, because the actual board and bean bags would be easy to make if you have the right tools. Haven't used it yet because we have not taken the trailer out, so not sure how the product holds up to elements."
1,Not good for glass pattern bars,"Just got my new blade. Was cutting 1 1/2"" wide X 1 1/2 thick"" glass pattern bars, used in fusing. It cut about 8 cuts, then starting chipping and breaking the glass. I kept trying but by about 15 cuts, it wouldn't even cut at all. I put my old, rusty tile blade back on and it cut the glass like it was butter. Do not recommend for thicker glass. Felt like it was the worst $100 (with shipping) that I ever spent."
3,does not cut all types of glass,"i bought this blade for cutting glass tiles for a kitchen counter backsplash. the tiles were made of a high density glass and this blade made very ugly, chipped cuts. mk diamond has given me a better blade for this work but users should be aware that cutting glass tiles is a slow process and that the tiles will still have some slight chipping or tearing of the backing."
2,not that sharp,had problems with the blade. The cuts were only good for a few cuts before it was chipping the glass.would return it if they would accept it
2,Not what I expected,"When I read the previous reviews on this book, I though great, some middle-of-the-ground information regarding BDSM - after having just finished reading the Topping and Bottoming books...but I was a bit surprised that the majority of the essays in this are from the male homosexual perspective.(I am hetero, primarily bottom) The reviews and book summary here did not hint at that. Yes, it is good to read the gay/lesbian side of BDSM, but that's not why I bought this book. Will be sending it back."
5,The Best Book on BDSM lifestyle available,"If you are trying to understand the BDSM Lifestyle, want to get into it or just are interested in how people can ""hurt so good"", then this is the book! Mr Baldwin is the ""John the Baptist"" of the BDSM (Bondage/Discipline, Sado/Masochism) movement and a truly eloquent writer. Even if you have never ""played"" you will be moved. This book has changed many a life and turned many people (male and female) onto this lifestyle. Forget ""the Story of O"" and read the REAL THING."
1,Not worth it!,"I agree with Lederbull on this one. I think the book is very outdated to start with. But the essays are written from the perspective of a psycotherapist and it presents itself that way. He is a leatherman, no question. But he takes himself too seriously and overlooks the basic points of Leathersex/BDSM. Over intellectualized I think, but then again, written by a psycotherapist.Very disappointed.Would not recommend this."
2,"Preach less, Teach more","Mr. Baldwin should stick to writing guides to leather pageants and give up the authoritative attitude and know all approach to his book. My newest boy brought his book to my attention and we had belly laughs at all the rules that are based in an authority that is constricting and overwhelming in the obvious attempt to impress. This paper thin treatise did not impress or inform. Like many other ""dominate"" men in leather I think I am safe in saying that the printed word is not where one is the best teacher. I am saddened that it didn't offer a more common sense approach and practical guidance."
5,must have,My husband has been snowmobling almost every end. And i finally got him to quit pinching pennies and buy this must have item
1,The worse!,"Str8 Garbage! This iz the at least worst compilation with pac eva son! Ya heard? Its been 16 years peeps! Let the don r.i.p pleaze let the late great king res! Yall gettin greedy now! All his songs been remixed,mixed with different beats! I quess u do anythang 4 money! STOP DA bulls#%it!!!"
4,Milwaukee's Golden Star,"It was a true delight to read this biography of Golda Meir. I've lived in Milwaukee for all but four of my 31 years of life, and I've never known much about this stellar woman. I was amazed to learn that she even fasted at age 5 as part of a protest!It was especially fun to read the Milwaukee references, including her family's arrival. When I read about her school experiences, I pictured her at her elementary school (now called Golda Meir School) just north of downtown Milwaukee. No wonder it's now a school for gifted and talented children!The drama of Golda Meir's life makes for a powerful story, which Deborah Hitzeroth nicely captures and complements with photos, background info and Golda's own words. As cliche as it might sound, Golda's story is an example of the power of the human spirit to overcome obstacles and accompish amazing feats."
1,ITS TOO SOON FOR A TRIBUTE.,STICK WITH THE REAL DEAL. IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY A PANTERA SONG BETTER THAN IT ALREADY IS.
4,...,"i avoided buying this cd due to the reviews. i regret buying PANTHER, the other tribute cd. i thought id chance it and buy this one due to the fact that HOSTILE INTENT and GODFLESH were on it. this is definitely the better one of the two tributes. PANTHER was really nothing more than a bunch of garage bands trying to give an interpretation of PANTERA. if you like HEAVY, buy this tribute and stay away from PANTHER..."
3,Decent showcase for lesser known bands,I think the Scary German Guy version of Suicide Note II is pretty damn cool. The rest of it is just average.
2,Streetwise Zurich,"This Streetwise Zurich map is fine but not up to the standard of most Streetwise maps. A significantly better map can be obtained for free at the tourist desk in the airport. The map doesn't have north pointing up, which is a bit confusing."
2,Lame little map,"This map only covers (in detail) a very small portion of Zurich. The 1:10,000 section of the map does not cover the airport, the zoo, or ETH Honggerberg (all locations that I'll be traveling too). It does cover the central train station.Also, the entire map is only four panels, so the Amazon product image is showing you 1/4 of the total map.I've seen other streetwise maps that are large and fold out to eight panels; that's what they should have done here. A physically larger map would have allowed them to cover a larger part of the city."
3,Zurich street map,"Map is very useful for the immediate downtown section of the city. It doesn't show the business areas to the north of the downtown, We found it usewful."
5,An enlightened defense of tolerance and reason,"This book was my first exposure to Popper's philosophy, which I have since found to be consistently convincing, enlightening, and inspiring. In the face of fashionable twentieth-century irrationalism and associated political fanaticisms, Popper stresses the importance of intellectual modesty, rational discourse, non-violence, tolerance, and an open society. In this series of collected essays Popper makes a lucid and compelling case for a philosophy that accepts that all of our knowledge is conjectural and uncertain, but that this, far from leading to irrationality, makes science and reason the best tools we have for confronting the universe that surrounds us. In contrast with the impenetrable, self-important nonsense of many modern philosophers, Popper writes with a refreshing simplificity and modesty. A truly beautiful and extraordinary book."
3,"Hey, whatever it takes","There are lots of fascinating revelations in this book: that Martha Stewart let all her goats die during the famous ""backyard livestock"" period; that she once poisoned an entire dinner party with ""the wrong kind"" of mushrooms; and even that she punishes her staff by forcing them to make little log cabins out of pencils. I couldn't put the book down. But besides all the juicy gossip, what is the reader left with -- a ""how not to"" manual for the modern businesswoman who wants to keep her soul?"
2,author's envy is showing,"Meanspirited book by a man who acts like he knows the ""real"" Martha Stewart. If he did, his book would be authorized. I am always amazed by writers who are quick to tear apart a successful person but who could never do anything anywhere what that successful person has done.Martha Stewart came from modest background and by nothing more than her own brain, guts and hard work, built a huge company that employs thousands of people, provides wonderful products.If she was a man, no one would call her a B****.You want someone sweet who will bake cookies for you and coddle you, go visit your grandma. You want someone who is sharp and expects the best, go work for Omnimedia and let Martha be your CEO.The author of this book is a weasel."
2,Not a good thing,"Just imagine if all the people who hated you talked to an author who was writing an unauthorized version or your life story. Would the account be a true picture of you as a person? Such is the case with this book. Clearly, because it was an unauthorized bio, the only people who would talk to the author were the people who were either jealous of, or had an ax to grind with Martha Stewart. The result is a one sided unflattering account of one of the greatest self made persons of our time. Why, I was expecting the author to try and trace Martha's ancestors back to Satan! I would not, therefore, recommend this book; unless you enjoy unwarranted hateful attacks on an american icon."
3,Poor Martha,"I think the author presents facts--as much as possible. He insults her three times and then writes something nice. Then he writes one nice thing, followed by three offensive comments. I don't find an overt attempt to trash Martha here, but found it to be a comprehensive portrait of her rise to fame. Still wondering if Martha is an outright villian, or a successful woman in a man's world--still an oddity the critics don't know how to handle.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said."
1,A successful woman always be treated unfairly,"Successful women are deemed to be monsters all the time and in everywhere, from ancient to modern day and from east to west. Because Martha Stewart couldn't be that perfect and elegant, her other disgraceful side is uncovered by people who want to entertain public. That's main idea of this book, rather than to persent an insightful and true story.In the content of this book, when Martha Stewart delivered her ideas of living to male executives, those men didn't understand how she can make money and lure audience by triming roses..... I don't need to mention the result that how successful she becomes. However, the above does reveal something, that man doesn't know what woman thinks and likes. He can't analyze or criticize a woman who he understands nothing.In my country, it is like a curse that a woman succeeds in her career then her husband would become a loser.I really hope people to be nice to these exhausted women."
3,A Side of Martha we don't see on TV.,"This book gives you alot of insite as to the ""Real Martha"". Anyone who is a fan of her television shows, this is a must read.It takes you from her childhood thru becoming a household name.The Author Mr. Byron is fantastic. He leaves no stone, good or bad, unturned."
5,A must read for all Martha fans,"This is a fascinating and well researched book about Martha's amazing business acumen, and how she has packaged herself as a unique American icon."
3,"Martha, exposed!","For those of us who place Martha Stewart somewhere between Leona Helmsley and Cruella de Vil, this book is for you! Hey, it's a great and easy summer read and the author, Christopher Byron makes no excuses for his bias. Some supporters of Martha's may tend to look at this book as a hatchet job on America's most famous businesswoman, but Byron actually compliments her from time to time on her rise through the corporate world. The problem, it seems, is that Martha Stewart continues to create her own woes. The author simply points them out. And he would have a field day with the recent hole into which she has put herself....namely insider trading.Martha Stewart may be a cunning and savvy figure dressed up in an apron for public viewing, but my sympathies do not extend to her. Funny how she has gotten into so much hot water in her professional life, but I guess the irony is this....boiling water is the first thing one learns in cooking!"
2,Worth Reading??,"I read this book to get a better understanding of who Martha is. I was disappointed to find that this book skipped over who Martha actually is and focused on how she is a screaming lunatic most of the time. His sources were all people who hate Martha or have a grudge on her for some reason, yet then he would write how brilliant she is. He didn't try to write a balanced view of her, he instead tried to satisfy both those who hate her and those who love her, without doing a great job for either.I found this book just made me sad and I didn't enjoy reading it; however it does give some history on MSO and how Martha created her business."
3,Can't decide between two or three stars,"First, I neither like nor dislike Martha Stewart. I've never read her books or magazines or watched her t.v. shows or videos. I work full time, am not very domestic, and don't much care about what she has to say.I did find interesting the parts of the book that talk about what its subtitle says it talks about. I gave it three stars for that.But the book might deserve two stars because it was also gossipy and opinionated.I expected this book to be more than one of those unauthorized biographies, which I avoid because I doubt them. I think this book bills itself as more than that, but it isn't."
2,Hollywood Scuttlebut,"Byron may be ""fair"" minded in his presentation of Martha but he would be better off as a Hollywood journalist. This wasn't a great biography, nor was it a book about business. It was more about hovering over a carcass and peering into crevasses.I admit to being a Martha fan but, first and foremost I am a businesswoman so I expect something of quality when a business person is discussed."
1,"If you read ""The National Enquirer"" you'll love this.","I was tempted to correct the factual and grammatical errors in this book and send it back to the author. Many incidents are so wildly exagerated that no reasonable person could possibly believe them. This fact, sadly, cast doubt over every statement in the entire book. I would'nt recomend this book to anyone unless they want to waste their time and money, its not a good thing."
4,What a witch!,"Very informative and interesting book. Obviously, she doesn't know ""What comes around, goes around."""
2,Where is she NOW?,"Lacks the recent happenings of Martha and her empire. Kudos for the research involved, but perhaps it could have been spent on bringing the reader to where she is now and where she may go. Is it true that Byron was turned down by Martha to write this book?"
3,Chick-ed again.,"I admire Martha Stewart even more than I did before I read this book. She is human, after all! She became a lightening rod for the diminished role of women's gentility that some of us remember fondly and long to rekindle in our culture. The suction effect of the vacuum created by discrediting the feminine side of human nature is what she attracted and filled. While she fell victim to the masculine drive for more and more money, she mastered the art of accumulating it beyond their imaginations.But it is our deepseated longing for feminine gentility that made her success metoric."
3,Martha,This book was very well documented. There was a lot of careful research done to complete this book. I enjoyed reading it.
5,Gripping!,"Byron's research is obviously exhaustive; his explanations of the business side of things are clear and accurate; but most importantly, his insights into the business mind and ambition of Martha herself are fascinating. I have stayed up entirely too late the past three nights reading this book! But it was worth it. An unusually interesting book for a business biography."
3,Just Desserts Is Better,"Martha Inc. is a balanced biography of Martha Stewart, but short on recent details. I was hoping to read more about her life after she started Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, but most of the material is a re-hash of many events that one can read in Just Desserts. The epilogue contains information about Martha and Kmart after the tech bust and Kmart's bankruptcy, which is a nice follow-up. The author, Christopher Byron, seems a bit star-struck by Martha, too, calling her a ""beautiful blonde"" a few too times in the book. Martha Inc. is a good read for Martha followers like me -- subscriber to the magazine, viewer of her TV show, consumer of Martha products -- but to the reader who wants even juicier details, read Just Desserts first."
5,Fascinating Exposee,"Byron's work in uncovering and exposing one of America's most visible figures is, simply put, BRILLIANT. Through his dependable and accurate sources, the author opens the deep, dark, murky, Martha, the Martha nobody knows, and nobody wants to know, and shows her to the world at large. With the deftness of the master flower arranger herself, Byron stacks the dark secrets of her life and rise to fame and fortune, exposing quite a bit about the American consciousness as well. Simply brilliant!!!!! (****1/2)"
5,Brilliant and Compulsively Readable,"This book rocks! I literally couldn't put it down. Byron managed to get all this great detail on Martha Stewart herself -- juicy tidbits as well as insightful ""fly on the wall"" descriptions of Martha's business acumen and tough negotiations. Martha created her empire with the knowledge that she'd tapped into something unique and didn't let anything stand in her way. She truly is a woman ahead of her time, and I found myself often in awe at what she accomplished while reading ths book. But after reading MARTHA INC, I know I wouldn't ever want to work for her or fall victim to a ""Martha Moment""! What a complex creature. What a great read!"
5,A real page-turner,"Walk your dog BEFORE you start reading, because you're going to want to read just one more chapter, and then just one more. And then another. Martha's a great topic, but it's really the author Byron's style and attitude that make this such a great read. I didn't want to put it down."
5,Amazing.,"Great read about an amazing woman. Love her or hate her, you can't help but be impressed by what she's accomplished. And Byron is a masterful storyteller. Never a dull moment. And funny!"
3,Behind Every Great Fortune is a Crime,"This is interesting, if incomplete, corporate history, and the story of a personality.Author Bryon obviously admires Martha Stewart's business acumen, her intelligence and ability to work very, very hard.Nevertheless, he paints a portrait of a tragic figure--the rich lady who has nothing in her life except work and more work. Her legendary temper has alienated her family and neighbors. The employees are so terrified of the CEO that they hide when their Distant Early Warning Sytem sounds the alarm that Martha is on her way. Not my idea of a good way to get through life.Ms. Stewart has cheated friends in order to get ahead. Most people would find that reprehensible. And, please note I would say the same of any successful businessMAN who did the same.I would have liked the book better if we had learned more about how Martha Stewart Omnimedia really works."
1,Exploiting a topic,"Putting aside the fact that I'm not a Martha fan, this book is truly disappointing. It has no idea or style; it only has a topic. The book is badly researched (based on a handful of Martha's former friends and neighbors turned foes). In an attempt to ""explain"" pure luck and dogged will, the book dwells excessively on (nonessential for the book) issues and events such as demographic trends and world events. Two or three ideas are repeatedly recycled to fill in about a dozen chapters. The author persistently tries to relate to Martha throughout the book and with the very publishing of the book, but fails. The amount of Westport gossip is incredibly overdosed, even accounting for the tastes of readers that had bought a Martha book."
3,Not enough business info,"Anyone who has watched Martha Stewart's Christmas special with Julia Child knows that she is a control freak. So I picked up this book expecting detailed information about how she built her company. Given that Chistopher Byron is a business writer, I expected a bit more. The IPO chapter is good, but I would have liked to know how Martha, et. al. actually manage Omnimedia. How are new products developed, etc? Byron seemed a bit too infatuated with Martha, like he wanted a date, to provide a better business analysis. Byron seems to want it both ways -- gossipy and analytical, and as a result, he doesn't excel at eiher.It's a quick, easy, and somewhat enjoyable read, but it left me wanting for more. It's the best book out there for those interested in the business side of Martha. If you're interested in women who have built businesses I also recommend A'Lelia Bundles' biography on Madame CJ Walker."
4,behind the scenes look at the famous lifestyle priestess,"This book chronicles Martha Stewart's successful business endeavours, meshed with interesting anecdotes about her ""dark"" side. It depicts Martha Stewart as a far more complicated personality than the smooth blonde image broadcasted on her TV shows and advertised in her magazine.It was interesting and well-written. However if you are looking for juicier details, ""Just Desserts"" is the book for you.Nothing in this book helped me explain the latest insider's trading scandal Martha is involved in. I still wonder why she opted to jeopardize her hard-earned empire, just to save, at least it seems to me, a menial amount of money..."
2,"Not about Omnimedia, mostly MS gossip","I ordered this book expecting to read the history of Martha Stewart Omnimedia and how Martha Stewart acheived such phenominal success. Instead, the book focuses on Martha's personal life to an embarrassing degree, making the book almost unreadable. I don't really care if a jealous friend thought that Martha treated her husband badly; I want to hear more about how she built a hugely successful business from the ground up. This is one of the least substantive business books that I have ever read, which is surprising given the author's strong business writing background."
4,Don't Do Martha!,"Gheez! Did this book ever change things for me! Having been a Martha fan for two decades, I was shocked at what I didn't know about her ascent to Omni-hood. And Byron's bibliography was the nail in the coffin. Without having verified all of Byron's sources myself, I have to say this book provides a convincing depiction of someone who will do anything for personal gain. Nothing or no one is sacred. Very sad and very disrespectful. (Only criticism: Byron belabored the similarities of Stewart and her father. Those were the only instances when I felt sorry for Stewart.)"
1,Secret Religious Sects?!!,Where is the data about secret masonic affiliations?Where is the connection between rock and roll and Bono?Where is the biblical eschatology?
3,might as well,"Highlander and Highlander 2. In 1985 Gregory Widen created a wonderful modern fantasy world which we all know and love by heart. Then Davis and Panzer took it upon themselves to create an awful franchise off it. Highlander 2 was their first mistake before a series that ignores the events of the original film and another movie that does the same but stays with the story. Don't ask me about the carton. NE ways. Highlander 2 is everything the first isn't. It's awful except the idea of Connor in the future was interesting and Connery's Ramirez was again enjoyable, however it takes a beautiful story of good versus evil and makes a sci fi future story out of it. If you can find this for a good price near the price of the director's cut go for buying this set, otherwise just buy the first film, director's cut and widescreen."
4,The S-Man,"This is a strange little tutorial on how to finesse and manipulate your way to success (which is what the ""S"" stands for in the title.)I had a great friend discover this book when we were kids and he used to preach to me constantly from it. (A great friend who also became a great and nationally known psychopath). I never forgot the book and thought I'd re-visit it to see if it's only useful for the dangerously insane, or if there is also some value for the less disturbed. It's a hard call."
5,The Truth About What Is On The Modern Marvels: Walt Disney World,"On March 28 get ready to got behind the scenes of Walt Disney World! This tells the history starting from the success of Steamboat Willie to Walt Disney World what it is today. A sneak peak at Expedition Everest is included. This TV show goes behind the doors of the most popular attractions. The main thing to learn about is synchronous motors, Soaring castles, sleek monorails and life-like animatronics. Watch and learn why so may people love Walt Disney World. The run time is two hours. Enjoy!"
2,Modern Marvels - Walt Disney World,"I found this DVD to to OK at best! Having traveled to WDW 30> times and being a DVC Owner I found the DVD to provide little useful information, wish I had the dollars back I spent on the DVD. Actually gave the DVD to a family member that has never been to WDW."
4,never enough info!,"dvd was great. lots of interesting stuff to see. interesting to see behind the scenes stuff a the parks. like most disney fans, it is hard to satisfy that insatiable appetite for all things disney. would have like to have seen and learned more but they have squeezed in a fair bit."
5,ExtinctAttractions.com loves this dvd,"We found this book to be a great re-source in our research for ourhistorical DVDs that cover Disneyland and Disney World featuringinterviews with Disney legends like Art Linkletter, Roy Disney,Bob Gurr and other amazing Disney Legends. Our DVDs featuremore specific ride info and this one is great for overall.ExtinctAttractions.comWe recomend this book!!"
4,Make Your Reservations and Pack Your Bags,"This is by the History Channel, and provides enough real inside information on the imagineers, the animatronics, and all those terrific things Disney people actually invented, including some that are now being picked up by more serious applications. It also goes into the planning and financial considerations, the Disney philosophy of how to treat visitors to the theme parks, and the things they learned from the limitations found in Disneyland.If I had kids and the money to indulge, I'd be planning a trip to Orlando right now."
4,Good,This is a good video about Walt Disney World. If you don't want to know some of the secrets than I wouldn't get it. It is very interesting on how they design and build the theme parks.
3,Nothing to make this vocalist stand out from the crowd.,"Just like the Kentucky Derby, the field of male vocalists is crowded with a lot of talented participants. On this outing Mr. Officer does a credible job; but there is nothing in his voice or presentation to make him stand out from the crowd. After giving this CD a couple of spins, I have relegated it to the ""seldom played"" shelf. There are a lot of other performers around who have delivered the same songs in a more memorable fashion."
5,"Purity of Blood, Arturo Perez Reverte.","I have read several of Perez Reverte's novels; they are well researched historically and well written. One can learn a great deal of Spanish history ofthe 16th and 17th century by reading his novels. He also knows about the poets and authors of that time as well: Cervantes, Gongora, Lope de Vega, Quevedo, etc."
2,So so; so what.,"Nothing special and the point of the book is never clear. There's a mission, but then we get a primer on the Spanish Inquisition [which I didn't expect ;-)], courtly behavior in Spain, and a prim look at sexual relations. Add all that up and you get a pretty boring book from the writer of the Flanders Panel, which was a good book. Oh well. Everybook can't be a good book, can it?"
4,Come for the Swordfights - Stay for the Verse,"Swordsman and his youthful sidekick facedown villains and religious fanatics in Inquisition era Spain. The action is swift, the philosophical asides and accompanying poetry of some of the players is marvelous. Truth be told, the characters with their exotic names kind of run together. But still a delight."
3,Interesting account of the working of the Spanish Inquisition,"This is the sequel to Captain Alatriste and continues with the Three Musketeers-like adventures of the eponymous captain in seventeenth century Madrid. It is essential to read the previous book to appreciate the story. Old conflicts and grudges are carried forward into this new story. A plan to rescue a nun from an abusive convent goes awry and Inigo Balboa finds himself in the Toledo dungeons of the Inquisition. I did like Captain Alatriste more than this second book. Now that we have been introduced to the characters, the novelty has worn off and there seems to be a lot of talk, but too little action to fill a whole book. On the other hand, the descriptions of the life of the period are fascinating as always. I think the most notable and interesting aspect of the book is its account of the working of the Spanish Inquisition."
3,Lots of Atmosphere,"Like the other Captain Alatriste books this novel is really a novella or a long short story. There is lots of information regarding the practices of the Inquisition. Captain Alatriste attempts to rescue a young woman from an evil convent. The rest of the novel details the consequences of this action. A B novel ,but for readers who love the Spanish culture of the time, this is for you."
2,Purity of Blood,"A dashing swashbuckler, Captain Alatriste, champions the cause of a young woman who has been forced into sexual slavery in a priest's home in the days of the Spanish Inquisition. At the heart of her trial is the issue of her heritage; she is of Hebrew descent. In the course of his struggle with the prejuidices holding not only an innocent girl captive, but a nation, the captain relives his own memories of the time he was a subject of the horrors and how afraid he was.** Though historically illuminating and shocking, the seesawing back and forth between memory and present narrative hampers the flow of the novel. However, if you have an interest in that period of history, this may not prove annoying to you. **Amanda Killgore"
2,Translation from Spanish!,"Had to read a lot between the lines as the translation from Spanish diluted much of the poetry and cadence of the original. It was a little difficult to read and I had to skip ""descriptive"" portions and just stick to the plot, which was O.K."
4,Nice welcome to Rizzoli and Isles,"I was a fan of Tess Gerritsen in her early years with books like ""Harvest"" and ""Gravity,"" but I had not read the Rizzoli and Isles series. I saw a few episodes on television so I thought I would give it a try. I like ""The Mephisto Club."" It wasn't a complicated mystery, but what I like about the television show is the quick and easy banter between the detective and the medical examiner, so it was a pleasant surprise to see this in the novel as well. Some brutal killings, a little ""demonesque"" implication with a club who have come together to rid the world of Satan's spawns, Rizzoli's great Italian family, and Tess Gerritsen's easily readable style make for a good evening's relaxation."
4,thoroughly enjoyable,"This novel succeeded in many areas, not the least of which was maintaining a high level of tension and suspense through the entire novel. The villain in this novel, Dominick was well developed, something I rarely see in fiction novels these days. My favorite aspect of the book is how the author skillfully teetered on whether or not there was a supernatural element to this novel. By the end of the book, I still couldn't say one way or the other. I also liked how the author weaved in backstory throughout the novel. It was very cleverly done. The ending did not disappoint as well.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
4,Mephisto Club,"This is the 6th book in the Rizzoli and Isles series by Tess Gerritsen. Another page turning book, no doubt. But here you get the whole gruesome details of decapitations, dismemberment, scenes and symbols. An international group of priviliged scholars, anthropologist, etc. screened liked minded people to join their club seeking and tracking ""evil"". They wanted to learn and try to solve the mystery that lies beneath evil. The presence of evil walking around in the streets and blending in with people. We could never really know what evil a person is capable of doing. Are some people just inherently bad or are some descendants of the devil?"
3,"Not bad, but not one of the better Stories in the seires","I have mixed feelings about this book. It was quite entertaining and had some interesting parts, but I had the whole plot figured out three chapters into it. It was like watching the usual suspects for the first time, I had that movie's ending figured out in the first five minuets. The plot is very predictable, and even though there are a few parts that try to throw you off the ending, it was not enough to make me doubt my initial thoughts.The book is well written and the subject matter kept my attention, but I don't think I will be re-reading this book. Still, it was enjoyable to read another chapter in the Rizzoli and Isles series. Had this book not been part of this series with these characters I think I would have hated this book."
1,if you like Tess. . .,this is a great book - story gives a different slant on the TV portrayal of the characters - but a great read
4,A great novel,I had a great time reading this book. It's the kind you don't want to put down. It provided entertainment and learning. Many interesting facts explained. You'll love the development of the characters.
5,I read this book to make my wife happy,"I read this book because my wife wanted me to. I don't care for crime novels. I work in the ""crime"" business and find no pleasure, typically, in reading about it. That being said, I LOVED this book. It didn't grab me from page one but that may have had more to do with my own reluctance to read it in the first place.I won't go into a plot break down. At this point many, many people have already done that. I found this book to be very well written. I didn't really enjoy reading some of the subplots but appreciated their presence to further flesh out the main characters. The story was wrapped up nice and tidy at the end as well.The only problem with this book is that it referenced events that proceeded it. Now I need to get the rest of the books in this series and read them in order. I'll be buying some new hardbacks if I can find them.Thanks Ms. Gerritsen. This book was fantastic."
5,Top Notch Thriller,"I am a fan of Tess Gerritsen and I like all her books but this is my favorite. I see some people didn't think it was 'up to her standards' but I disagree. I liked it because Gerritsen did a good believeable job putting together an interesting mystery. Also it had all my favorite ingrediants for mystery...high adventure, it was scary, it had good characters and so on. I would love to see this as a movie!"
3,Uncharted waters,"I have read all of Tess Gerriten's books and this one just didn't do it for me. This one seemed to deviate far from her books like ""The Sinner"" or ""The Apprentice"". It just didn't captivate me like all her other books have. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad book; but it just wasn't great.That said, this book goes into uncharted waters - Gerritsen explores evil as more than an abstract construct in this book: Rizzoli and Isles find themselves caught up with a group who believe evil is real - physical demonic entities that walk among us and are made of flesh and blood - and certainly there are a series of gruesome murders threatening the lives of everyone involved, including Dr. Maura Isles, who certainly doesn't believe in demons.Read it for yourself, that's all I can say."
5,A Real Page Turner,"This was my first Tess Gerritsen novel and I'm certainly glad I picked this one up. Two Thumbs up. I read this on a very long, boring plane ride and it made it seem like minutes. I was disappointed when I landed, couldn't wait to get to my hotel room to finish it.Dr. Gerritsen knows her craft. The tension heats up on each page! Her characters are well developed, dialogue is superb and plot just rolls along to an explosive conclusion! I've already purchased two previous novels! Can't wait to dig in!Linda BilodeauAuthor, Stepping Through Seagrass, The Olive Branch A Tale of Resistance"
4,Some loose ends,I really enjoyed this book just as I have all the previous books in this series. I did find the book had some loose ends at its conclusion. Other than that it was a great story and a very enjoyable read. I recommend it. I look forward to starting the next R&I Novel.
3,great new character development,WInding plot with lots of twists and turns keep you reading. Ending was a little abrupt with a twist not previously developed in the story. Left me completely surprised with virtually no clues to figure out. I like to be able to see a connection instead of an undeveloped plot twist.
4,good read as always,"I have read all of Tess Gerritsen's books and was not disappointed, once again could not put it down. I love that the powers that be have taken her work and put it into a series. I never miss a program. Tess keep up the good work."
1,Boring,"The two main characters are incredibly insensitive and stupid. The usual lust for gory details is disgusting. The irony and sarcasm in front of mutilated bodies is not self-defensive, is only alienated and deranged.Sample of a phone dialogue: ""It is a murder"". ""Oh, you sound pretty sure of yourself!""And the plot is miserable. I threw the book in the trash after 100 pages.Tess Gerritsen is fascinated with death, torture and mutilation. I am not."
1,The Mephisto Club,Was very disappointed in this novel. Most of the time Gerritse book'syou don't want to put down this one was easy to do so.
3,Kind of disapointing ending,"The book was pretty good and fast paced but the ending was really disapointing. The book was like a good sandwich on stale bread. I didn't realize this was a series so this is the only book I have read, but the characters seemed one dimensional and maybe this is because by the 6th book you should know them? Good to pass the time with in the doctor's waiting room but not good enough to make me want to read anything else by this author."
2,Disappointing!,Fizzles and drags with the weird conspiracy stuff. Hope Gerritsen inproves with the next book. Disappointing!
2,Not My Cup Of Tea,"Several gruesome murders occur in Boston and up state New York. Detective Jane Rizzoli and Doctor Maura Isles determine they are all connected. A group of people who are knowledgeable in evil and it's history (the Mephisto club) become involved and help to interpret some signs found at the murder scenes. I'm with Rizzoli...I like cold hard facts. These stories about evil demons and fallen angels are just not my cup of tea. Usually when I'm reading a book, it is very hard to pry me loose from it. While reading this book, I was easily distracted by anything and everything going on around me. The ending of this story was the only part I found interesting. This one was a struggle to get through."
2,Shockingly.......bad,"What a great plot idea. Too bad it was so poorly executed.Haphazard secondary plot lines that go nowhere. A ""mysterious"" foundation head, who you keep expecting to do something remarkable...and yet never does. And a denouncement that's unbelievably brief after such a prolonged buildup of tension...what a let down.This book could have used a few more rewrites, or at least a better editing job."
3,Genre is getting sort of sick,"Another interesting read . . . about my 4th or 5th Gerritsen book . . . but I'm increasingly disturbed by the fact that virtually all of Gerritsen's victims are females upon which utterly abominable desecrations are perpetrated. I had actually decided not to read any of her work because of this, and am sorry that I broke my promise to myself."
2,"OOOOOOOPs, I forgot to write an ending","My my my, another gore novel minus an ending. You better have read the prequels to this to understand the characters: you know, the stay at home Dad who is married to the overzealous detective; the mother of the Pathologist who seems to have been evil but you are given no clue why; the sex starved stalking priest who you think is the killer until he disappears from view around page 200. I could go on and on, what a disappointment. Enough gore Ms. Gerritsen, write an ending and develop your characters. A waste of money, should have waited for the paperback, would have burned better in the fireplace. You want to read a thriller? Pick up ""What matters Blood"". That is a fun read. I put Mephisto Club in the category of a Patricia Cornwall novel, it's like kissing your sister. Ain't nothin to it! OOOOOPs, I ain't got a sister and this book ain't got an ending!"
3,A casual read,"I read this the other day and was let down. What is it with the spate of DVC knock offs? The plot was interesting, but throughout I kept on wondering why so many authors are now exploring a similar genre to the DVC.I also felt that the two main female characters' friendship didn't seem as genuine to me (Isles/Rizzoli). I think that IRL two very close friends would stick together better and Rizzoli's judgmental feelings just seemed trite and unnatural or perhaps unreasonable.If you've read other TG books, then you'll like this, but I was left a lil' disappoitned and I've read her medical thrillers, but none of her Harlequin/love story books."
2,Starts Strong But Goes Rapidly Downhill!,"Let me start off by saying that if you haven't read any of Gerritsen's books featuring her two main characters, don't even consider reading this book. So much about the characters deeply depends on your being familiar with their history. Even if you have read other books with these characters, The Mephisto Club, while starting off with a lot of suspense, is a disappointment. The plot drags and requires you to suspend belief way too much, there are too many subplots that are left dangling, and the ending -- what there is of one -- is weak and unsatisfying. All in all, I'd advise you to skip The Mephisto Club. Your time and money are too valuable to spend on a book that, at best, is mediocre."
5,"An ""edge of the seat"" mystery",I am always captivated by Tess Gerritsen's stories and this is no exception. One is kept in suspense with one murder after another taking the lives of a strange group of people who meet to discuss the world around them.
4,Good Read,"I've been really enjoying Tess Gerritsen's Rizzoli & Isles series of mysteries. The TV show did peak my interest, and now I can't get enough of them. The Mephisto Club introduced Anthony Sansone, a character repeated in subsequent books. Who can resist a good-looking millionaire with a penchant for solving murder? In this book, the Mephisto Club is an integral part of the investigation, as the members are being targeted.Maura Isles has her own issues in this book - her indiscreet affair with a Catholic priest. She met Father Daniel Brophy while solving murders at a convent. Their friendship has blossomed into much more than either one thought possible.While Maura deals with her conscience, Jane Rizzoli is a wife and mother, juggling homelife with her career. Her life becomes even more complicated when her parents marriage dissolves.I have to admit I didn't anticipate the ending. It had everything a good mystery needs. Good read!"
1,Derogatory,"With an absurd plot, this is the worst of Gerritsen's novels. The book takes on an affair with a priest, along with satanism. Can't get much more anti-Catholic than that."
5,An Eternal Song That Makes The Entire Album Worthwhile,"This is a fantastic song! Conway Twitty put out the song ""It's Only Make Believe"" first, when he attempted to break into the Music Industry as a Rock-n-Roll singer. He later put out a slower and wholly different version for the Country & Western audience. Even if you're not a Conway Twitty fan, which I am generally not, this song will hook your heart forever. I first heard it when I was 15 and not a week, much less a day, has gone by in 19 years, that I have not sung this song to myself, or listened to one of the versions of it.It speaks so very true to the emotions of a true love that isn't returned, or at least doesn't seem to be, and that eternal hope that consumes your heart and soul..."

4,Great Movie,"What a Classic, it's your typical Mel Brooks movie. It has it's funny parts and then it has those parts that make you shake your head and makes you wonder why did I get this movie. I still enjoyed it, it's just one of those movies if you like Mel Brooks you will more then likely like this one too.I gave it 4 stars because I found this to be an entertaining Movie."
4,HILARIOUS MEL BROOKS COMEDY!!,"MEL BROOKS' LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD IS ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS!! IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, YOU SHOULD DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND WATCH IT! THIS IS A COMEDY CLASSIC, FROM A COMEDY GENIUS!!"
1,Waste Of Talent!,"The movie did have some funny parts, but was not up to Mel Brooks standards. Young Frankenstein, it was not. Not a movie for children under 18. Simply one of those movies where great talent was wasted."
2,Piece of historical crapola.,"Has it's moments early on with Sid Caesar, but then takes a horribly wrong turn on the way to and beyond ancient Rome.If you ever thought Dom DeLuise was NOT funny, here is further proof."
1,really dumb ass movie...,... the begginning was funny..until it got to the roman empire part...really stupid..u can find alot more funnier movies then this..spaceballs was better then this...way better..anyhow nuff said...peace
5,Brooks is at his best!,"This movie was absoloutely hilarious! From the Roman Empire scene where they defeat the Royal Guards by getting them high, to the French Revolution, it's non stop laughs. The Spanish Inquisition is by far the best. It's done like a broadway musical complete with synchronized swimmers. Must see!"
5,"really, really funny",I saw this just a little while ago and I laughed so hard. The Spanish Inquisition was the best scene!
3,The DVD transfer is terrible!,"Buy this bare-bones version only if you don't care about the video/audio quality of the DVD. This disc is screaming for a new transfer. It does look/sound better than the VHS Pan & Scam version, but it certainly doesn't take advantage of the DVD format.The movie gets 5 stars, but the transfer gets 1."
5,Outstanding comedy,"I just love this movie. Mel Brooks is a comedic genius and this is one of his best films. The jokes are timeless and very funny. After watching this film, you will understand why your friends and collegues say, ""It's good to be the King!"""
2,STUPID FUNNY,OK I GUESS YOU HAVE TO BE A CERTAIN KIND OF PERSON TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE. IT JUMPS FROM SCENE TO SCENE VERY FAST SO YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION. I DIDNT HATE THIS MOVIE. I JUST DIDNT GET IT I GUESS. MY BOYFRIEND SWEARS ITS THE BEST MOVIE EVER. THE COSTUMES IN THE MOVIE ARE GREAT. IF YOU LIKE STUPID COMEDY THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU.
3,2 1/2: The worst movie Mel Brooks has directed but. . .,"In my opinion, this is the worst movie Mel Brooks has directed. But that isn't saying much since he has only directed eleven movies (BLAZING SADDLES, DRACULA: DEAD AND LOVING IT, HIGH ANXIETY, this one, LIFE STINKS, THE PRODUCERS, ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS, SILENT MOVIE, SPACEBALLS, THE TWELVE CHAIRS, and YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN). It really isn't that bad, just compared to the others, it's the worst. It IS entertaining and fun at times (The Spanish Inquisition is the best part) but it is just okay compared to the classics YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, BLAZING SADDLES, and THE PRODUCERS.**P.S. Don't you think Fox should release HIGH ANXIETY, ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS, SILENT MOVIE, and THE TWELVE CHAIRS?**"
1,A long wait for nothing.,"I ordered this DVD to be given as a gift. After initially being told that it was ""pending"", I waited two weeks before inquiring about a shipping date. The response was that they could not find a copy of this DVD and apologized for the inconvenience. I wondered if I had not e-mailed Movie Mars, if they would have bothered to tell me that it didn't have the DVD. I won't use the company again."
5,History of the World Part I,"This is one of Mel Brooks' least known and funniest movies. I have owned it on VHS, DVD and had to have the Blu-ray version to add to my collection. Many of the great stars of this movie are gone; Ron Carey, Harvey Korman, Dom DeLuise and Madeline Kahn (she is outstanding as the Empress Nympho), but this should go down as one of the great comedies of all time. Even funnier is the preview at the end of the movie for Brooks' next movie ""History of the World Part II"" that was never intended to be made. This should not be missed."
3,not for everybody,"I really enjoy Mel Brooks work, BUT here's the problem (at least with this one):In order for you to understand the humor (very clever by the way), you must have a fair knowledge of history. I'm not talking about the short 400- years of American ""history"", I'm talking about Greek and Roman civilizations and crist, and stuff like that. The humor in the movie is really very clever, but you won't get it if you don't know what it's referring to (It's like watching the third episode of a mini-series).I found myself sitting there with a couple of friends and after every scene explaining to them what was going on. They were about ready to kill me (out of boredom) when I finally decided to watch it later on my own."
4,History of the World - Pt. I,"One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Although not recognized as such, I would consider this flick to be on of Mel Brook's greatest hits. The ""Last Supper"" scene is, in my opinion, one of the top 3 comedy scenes of all time. One of the few scenes that I can watch over and over and roll off the couch laughing.One negative aspect of the movie is the end scene (""The French Revolution"") does move slower than the rest of the movie. As a matter of fact, it seems that the movie gently declines in terms of comedy. (The first half is the best.) But don't let that sway you from purchasing this movie, because it's a great laugh-fest!"
3,"Funny, but I wouldn't watch it twice","I bought this not long ago thinking it would be one of those comical movies I could watch over and over when nothing good was on TV. It was amusing, but, I couldn't sit down and watch it again. After the first 35 minutes I was bored and found myself questioning whether or not I should continue.It's one of those ""Napoleon Dynamite"" movies, you either love it or hate it. The very dry humor is focused on taking a trip through time as Mel acts out character parts of important people and times in History. Dressing up as a Trojan soldier, smoking a 7 foot doobie to get the other soldiers ""too high"" to chase them. It just wasn't very funny. It's yesterday's history lesson with today's sarcasm and slang."
5,Mel Brooks moonlights as a world history teacher,"Mel Brooks goes at it again. Brooks this time around takes us on a hilarious fun filled trip through time, to show us what REALLY happened throughout history. The film begins with Brooks' broad sendup of '2001', then goes forward to Acient Rome (Mel plays a 'stand-up philospher' in Caesar's Palace),and to the French Revolution (Brooks reigns as King Louis XVI). The best, greatest,and funniest highlight of the film is the Spanish Inquistion scene complete with singing monks and swimming nuns. Another 500 STARS to this hilarious world history lesson."
5,great movie,"Since i saw this film the first time in 1984, it is still the film i most talk about. Every scene in this movie set you of laughing. From the start with 2001 a space.... till Hitler on ice, ( the foney trailer at the end) you will have tears on your in your eyes."
5,The best way to make history funny!!,"Mr. brook's has the best way to make history funny. I know that the Spanish inqusition was a very sad thing but when you have Mel make it into a comedy you can make a sad thing hilarious. I loved all the stupid jokes in it because that is what made it funny. I loved this movie better than Monty Python and the holy Grail, and I loved that movie."
4,The best of Mel Brooks,"A film written, produced, directed and acted by Mel Brooks is his Master Piece!This film remains continuously funny and entertaining for 20 years so far except for the Spanish Inquistion which was boring and embedded with historical myths!But if you take it as it is, you won't stop laughing and will enjoy it as a Classic Commedy."
1,So far won't play on any of my 3 Sony blu-ray players,I have 2 ps3's the slim and the older version and another Sony player not sure the model but none of them even show the disc is in the player no pop up screen or anything tried changing some settings and nothing helped tried it on a different player worked fine kinda dumb that it won't play in a Sony player of all things go figure :-/
3,Must understand history,"Very good movie for those who are interested in history. A lot of the jokes require knowledge of the past to understand. I sat with a friend watching this who is more of a liberal arts person and he hated it. So if you are into history, watch this movie!"
4,good movie,"love this movie and again it is not your decision how many words it will take ME to decide how ""I"" describe the way I feel about the product I will not review another until it is removed"
3,"Funny stuff, esp. for Mel Brooks fans","i wish i could give 3.5, but i can't, nor can i in good faith say this is the work of comic art that Mel Brooks' other films were. The Caesar (sp?) scene is so funny, and it is copied verbatim from Monty Python's Life of Brian (1979). I agree with Leonard Malton on this, and with that other critic on the ""take it or leave it"" aspect. this is a video you'd want to rent for a laugh because 1) it's Mel Brooks; 2) because it's better than most all TV. ""It's good to be the king!"" but the only reason i'd buy it would be to add it to Blazing Saddles, Spaceballs, and The Producers."
2,i didn't find it funny except for one gag,"i may have managed a few few smiles here and there throughout themovie,but there was nothing about it would considerfunny.actually,scratch that.there was one gag i did find a bit funnythe first couple of times.after that,it wore thin,though.i didn't findthe movie boring though,and it was watchable.as a movie,it's notbad.as a comedy,it's a different story.if i hadn't known it wassupposed to be a comedy,i would have had different expectations.i'm notsure why i didn't like it.maybe once you hit a certain age,Mel Brooksand his brand of humour doesn't work.anyway...for me,History of theWorld Part I is a 2/5"
3,one of the funniest movies in history...,history of the world is the basis for many many pop culture jokes... absolutely hilarious. only disappointment was the mono audio track.
2,"If this is history, I don't like it","History of the World, Part I is, at best, an okay movie. At its worst it is a sexist homophobic piece of junk. It goes on for too long and half the stuff is so offensive you just can't laugh it off. Some of it is funny, and you think it might get better, but then Brooks brings it back down with his unfunny humor. You want good Brooks? See ""The Producers,"" ""Young Frankenstein,"" and ""High Anxiety."" But stay away from this one"
2,Hx of the World Review,"This product arrived on time and in excellent condition. I really didn't like the movie, but that has nothing to do with the quality of the seller. Seller - Excellent. Movie, not so much. It jumps around a lot and wasn't as funny as I had hoped. Someone with different taste in humor may very well enjoy the movie."
3,The Inquisition,"This film had a bit more explicit content than I'm used to seeing, but it's decent. Some parts aren't so great, but Comicus performing at Caesar's palace and Count De Monet relieving himself in a bucket deliver big time.I also liked the showstopping Inquisition number."
4,Classic Mel Brooks,Mr. Brooks had done it again with this comedy that is loaded with laughs in all categories. It has plenty of classic scenes that have become classic Brooks scenes (The Spanish Inquisition). Don't miss the French Revolution segment!
4,Great campy humor,"""Fresh from his glorious victory over the Cretins at Sparta--er, make that the Spartans at Crete""....""Torquemada--do not implore him for mercy. Torquemada--let's face it, you can't talkimouda anything!""""Don't get saucy with me, Bearnaise.""Lots of silly, campy lines make History of the World a real treat. As you'd expect with Mel Brooks, the cast is hilarious: Sid Caesar, Madeline Kahn, Harvey Korman, Dom DeLuise, Gregory Hines, Bea Arthur, and the funny albeit typecast Andreas Voutsinas (who played Carmen Ghia in The Producers) as the saucy Bearnaise. Cloris Leachman as Mme. Lafarge (""no, no, dumb shkum"") is a hoot as she rouses the rabble and wannabe Maurice Chevaliers on the Rue de Merde. Not on the level of Young Frankenstein, but still 90 mins. of good plain fun!"
4,Darling book,"My boys love this book ~~ they both grin everytime I show them a page. Right now, my husband and I are on a polar bear kick since the boys both showed an interest in the polar bear at the local zoo.Lars, a little polar bear, wants nothing more than to have a friend. He soon learns he has to be careful of what he wishes for! He gets kidnapped to be taken to a zoo and along the way, he meets a Walrus and Bea, a little brown bear. They escape to go home and Bea comes home with Lars.It's a lovely little story with great detailed pictures. It's great to keep the kids' interest while reading ~~ and someday when my boys are older, it'll be a great book for them to learn how to read.It's a cute addition for any library!1-8-04"
3,Not in a perfect world,"I agree that this is not a perfect product. It does come loose at the corners, but has anyone found anything better? Slipping rulers drive me crazy."
4,worked like a charm,This product was recommended by other quilters. They weren't wrong about it. It helps keep my ruler in place while cittong fabric.
5,Works well,Easy to cut and apply to my rulers and cutting guides. Seems to help hold them steadier and they don't shift when using a rotary cutter.
5,Great movie,Love amazons service ..I'm hooked its a old school movie about cheating you have to watch to believe enjoy get some popcorn
3,Somewhat Disapointed,"Barroso's Brasil has achieved iconic status, the film was memorable, Michael Kamen did exceptional, imaginative work with the music, yet the CD was put together in a sloppy manner. What I heard on the Amazon provided samples is pretty much all there is. For example, ""Central Services/The Office"" piece, which showcases Kamen's extraordinary talent, is 1'41 minutes and is sloppily ended with talk from film scenes. It appears the publisher was not interested in this project, they just cut pieces from the film which contained music, without much concern of how the pieces begin or end. I also expected more music, less chat and less special effects. However deficient, just having samples of Kamen's work is worth the price.Received the CD in five days. The seller, ImportCD and Amazon both get 5 stars for their service."
3,Paris Underground,American woman operated Underground in PAris WWII to help British soldiers escape from France; 391 pp;
1,Not for Mac,"Don't believe the statement that this works for Mac. After spending lots of time with technical support for both Apple and the bluetooth adaptor manufacturer, they both said that no, it was not intended to be used with Mac."
4,a great combination of voice and strings,"I originally heard Susanne Rosenberg's voice accompanying some of Hoven Droven's songs... and knew it was something special. the third track, in particular, highlights her impressive voice, as much for the whimsical tone it evokes as the tonal range she can summon.but the album is also impressive for the quality of the string arrangements. the phrasing, and interplay, of the vocal parts and the strings adds a texture and richness to an album which is, otherwise, very simple in its production."
2,"Not artistic, not proffecional.","This book is nice, but not artistic. There is nothing about composition. There is even nothing about freehand drawing! And the blending! Blending your drawing is the same thing as blurring your drawing. It kills all emotion of the stroke! If you ever want to become the proffecional at drawing, dont take this book. Don't spend your money!"
3,Regular,"El libro es un extracto de los articulos que el autor ha publicado durante todos sus aÃ±os en las columnas del Miami Herald y otra publicaciones.En algunas partes repite lo que ha dicho anteriormente puesto que es el trabajo de muchos aÃ±os.Para las personas nuevas o viejas en el negocio es interesante porque plantea en una forma amena y sencilla la mayoria de aspectos del negocio de Bienes y Raices.Lo unico que tiene de malo es que el autor remata casi todas sus columnas diciendo que debe consultar siempre con un experto en el tema. Es decir un Broker, un abogado y un contador.No tengo nada en contra de ello pero parece desesperado tratando de venderse a si mismo y a su empresa la cual ha puesto con fotos y todo al final del libro."
4,Muy bueno,Me encanto da una ayuda general y especifica de cada problema pero si se quiere dominar el tema se debe estuidar otras guias pues este solo es un compendio de una serie de articulos de revissta por lo tanto cada tema tiene a los sumo 2 o 3 paginas
5,Good yoga book,Excellent pictures and information but most won't learn all of this in a weekend. Not a very realistic goal for most.
4,What is normal?,"Charly starring Cliff Robertson is a good take on the classic book, Flowers for Algernon. Roberston is flawless as mentally handicapped Charly (he won an Oscar as well). The only problem I have with the movie is the slow moving camera, it feels dated and over-used. Important film so give this film a viewing soon."
2,Depressingly bad,"The Bottom Line:Charly does a fine butcher's job on the classic novella Flowers for Algernon, featuring one of the most bizarrely out of place scenes I've ever seen in a motion picture (Charly, upon gaining intelligence, joins a wild motorcycle gang!) in addition to an overwhelmed Cliff Robertson (who cannot pull of the ""genius"" side at all) and an especially turgid pace: stay FAR away.1.5/4"
5,It has everything!,This movie will make you laugh and cry (but motly cry). It is almost as good as the book. An excellent classic to watch over and over.
4,Charley,"Imaginative story of a retarded young man who is given an experimental treatment that causes his mental function to improve exponentally over time. The changes in his life style, experiences, relationships and capabilities are all sensitively depicted by an excellent performance by Cliff Robertson. Clair Bloom, Sean Connery's exwife turns in a good supporting performance as well as providing a romantic subplot."
1,Nothing like the book,"Appears to be some type of Avant-garde 60s part beatnik, part hippie translation of what was a very good book. The movie left out most of the best parts from the book. In fact the movie added some very strange scenes that were never in the book. Wish I had not bought the movie."
3,Amazon Verified Purchase,"I purchased this for my class to view in parts while reading the book, Flowers for Algernon. In some ways it helped clarify points in the story, but in many ways it caused a little confusion since the movie strayed from the novel. All in all they enjoyed the movie, though. It arrived in a timely fashion."
5,charly video,I read this book with my 8th grade reading class and having the movie to follow up with was perfect. There are some differences between the book (Flowers for Algernon) and the movie but it's still a great teaching tool.
3,A psychedelic adaptation of Flowers for Algernon,"I found both the short story, ""Flowers for Algernon,"" and this film adaptation of it to be moving; but the experimental cinematography and somewhat immature storytelling of the screenplay at times made me squirm. The film is almost interesting in itself as a sort of time capsule of 1968 moviemaking; but in the end I think it rests on the strength of the original story and the sincere (if somewhat hokey by today's standards) performance by Robertson to make the movie work in spite of itself. Those plusses weren't enough, obviously, to save the film from obscurity; and it seems odd in an age of remakes that this gem hasn't been targeted for a modern reprise. It could certainly be done better with today's techniques and the maturity of the medium. Bottom line, it's worth renting, but I don't know if I'd want to own it."
1,WIDE SCREEN RELEASE,"Will not buy this movie till it comes out in it's original aspect ratio, 2.35. MGM, how comes this one is coming out in pan and scan when most of your others are wide screen?"
2,Charly,"I found it hard to believe that Cliff Robertson won an Oscar for what is essentially a condescending portrait of mental retardation. The use of ""psychedelic"" split-screen was at once annoying and laughable. Claire Bloom fared best as Charly's sympathetic teacher but less so as his sexy lover. Consider this a movie with noble but failed intentions. Either that or time has not been kind to this sixties relic. What personally galls me is that Peter O'Toole lost the Oscar to Robertson for his infinitely superior performance in ""Lion in the Winter""."
3,Not the movie I remember,"I remember seeing a movie about Charly Gordon (Flowers for Algernon) in Jr. High. Though the same story, this wasn't the same movie and for me, the story was lost in Cliff Robertson's over acting. Also, the ""tripped-out"" 60s biker scene came from nowhere, and pushed the film right over the cliff it had been struggling to avoid.I'll not rehash the story line, but I would like to say the ""acting"" of Cliff Robertson greatly overshadowed the character of Charly Gordon. This is unfortunate, because the story has so much potential."
4,Charly is a great Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"It was a great movie even thought it didn't follow the book that good. I think that Cliff Robertson did a very good job at it, but it was funny when Charlie fell in love Mrs. Kinnian because he kinda attacked her. The motor cycle part wasn't in the book and Dr. Strauss wasn't a man in the Movie but Dr. Strauss was a man in the book. Whoever said that the movie was awful stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I recommend that people of all ages should read the book and watch the movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Rushed and Confused but Beautiful,"unfortunately this film tries to push the whole wonderful story 'Flowers For Algernon' into a way too short film. Everything is missing, the most important elements of the book are just not there.Cliff Robertson is excellent but at times he looks too old for the part of Charly. His over-use of the drooling mouth effect can become annoying as does watching charly (low iq version) spelling out words with his lips.However, watch this a few times and you will realize that this is a truly sweet film, sad and touching and great for rainy Sunday afternoons!"
5,NeW fOuNd GlOrY rOx!,"New Found Glory's new self titled CD is definetly something i would reccomend to punk/pop lovers! With catchy melodies about lifes pros and cons, it's a great CD to listen to when trying to get over someone or 'pumped ' up! BEST CD!! GO ON AND BUY IT ALREADY!!!"
1,crooks,These guys promised shipment by early march and no later than 3/11/11 and still no communication. When I called them they assured me a shipment by the end of the week and then canceled my order to save face. I called back and they said that I canceled the order not them. BS these guys are crooks.
3,Equine enthusiast,"This book is well written and easy to read. The writer very clearly states that she geared her book for the 'perfect' set-up. Unfortunately, that rarely occurs and those of us who have less than perfect begin to ask whether we should have horses at all - not a fair position. There are many of us who board and will never be able to obtain a 60x100 pipe corral or three feedings a day which the author recommends.Not all of us deal with blizzards, drifting or falling snow, water troughs frozen over, etc. So, the reader may end up ignoring large sections of the text no matter how useful.As a resource for setting up a horse property, the book has something to offer, however, not as much as I had hoped."
5,AMAZING BOOK!!!!,This is by far the best horse book I have read. Anyone who is thinking of owning a horse or even if you own a horse this is a must have for your bookshelf!! This book includes basic knowledge you should know and plus some!! I will definitely recommend this book to everyone I know!
4,Interesting Information,"I specifically bought this book to research stables for horses on small acreage. In reality, it covers many basics of actual horsekeeping (just like the name says!) and care. Nutrition, blanketing, wrapping, worming, etc. This wasn't information I was looking for, but it was very good, accurate, and practical, and I think many would find the information very useful. I did think the more 'nuts and bolts' information of setting up a stable was good. Especially things like water sources, siting the stable, fencing, types of stables, manure disposal. Was personally hoping for more architectural info, but a solid good horsekeeping book nonetheless."
2,Not for the amature at heart...,"This is way to ""Over the top"" To critical... Makes me unhappy with anything that I have already done...."
1,Nice Design but broke after second use,"I purchased this DVD player cause i thought it was a nice original design and is half the size of a regular DVD player, but when i went to use it for the third time the unit would not turn on. Since it was older than 30 days (but less than a year) i called Coby directly. They said i had to send it to them, plus $12 to get it fixed or they would send a new one, but that it would take 4-6 weeks! Since it was only $35 I junked it and got a second Philips unit which i have never had problems with."
1,Coby is terrible.,"I had this product for several months, but only used it a total of maybe ten times before it stopped working completely. Even in earlier uses it didn't work as advertised, because it wouldn't play my DVD+Rs correctly. Also this player has the worst remote control I've ever used. The buttons are completely flat and extremely hard to push. I had a similarly priced unit from Magnavox that lasted for years, so I don't buy the whole 'you get what you pay for' argument. This product is just poorly made. I won't be buying any more Coby DVD players."
3,"ok dvd player, crappy remote","This dvd player is alright. Picture and sound quality are good, especially considering the cheap price. However, the one big drawback is the remote, this thing is tiny and the buttons are not very responsive."
1,miserable writting,"snobish, deceptive,arrogant,low charaxcter, poorly written, self published?bigotedself agrandisement of authoris not worth the paper its written on"
3,Sturdy but big,"It's very well built. Extremely sturdy. Great size for camping or some hiking. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it is too big for my use. I wanted something I could take on a run. This is definitely not it. Either I wasn't paying attention to the dimensions or they were not listed. The actual size is the size of a back support a mover would use with a back pack attached to the front and two huge (1000 ml each) water bottles on each side. Remember a 24 oz water bottle is only 750 ml. And as the other reviewers have stated, you cannot substitute a 24 oz or smaller bottle because there is only one strap on the bottom so it would fall right through. The 1000 ml bottles are also attached to a bungee cord at top securing it tightly in its place. Any other bottle would not fit properly with this bungee because of the location of the cord. It seems it would be more comfortable for a taller person (over 6 ft), but definitely not for running no matter how tall you are."
4,LOVE THIS,"This is a great pack the only issuse that I found with it is that you have to use containers that are the same size as the bottles, if not the containers slip out. I added leather to the bottoms of the drink holders so that my smaller containers did not slip out.The pack holds a lot I was a little surprised at how big this was when it first came in but found that it is perfect for what I am using it for."
1,Boycott,"This pitiful excuse for a book should be boycotted as it serves to profit the Betrayers of Aileen Wournos and has no additional information that you can't get from Nick Broomfield's documentary.The new Book ""Dear Dawn"" is a genuine, wonderfully intriguing book that publishes with permission from Aileen Wournos before her execution, all the letters she wrote to her childhood fried ""Dawn Botkin"" and everything contained in this book is non fictional and fact. Straight from her mind to ours. A true understanding of Aileen. Buy Dear Dawn if you are interested in the bare truth about Aileen Wournos."
3,Good but not the best translation,We wished to review this book so we could be in my Brother's discussion group on the Trojan Women. A better translation is one by Lattimore.s
3,"sexy, but no nudity","Everything you would expect from a 60's b-movie, except no nudity. There's some swimsuit and bra shots, but thats it."
5,Tried and tested,Have used these type of switch panels on my last few boats and never had a problem with any. This latest one however did seem to be made of slightly thinner plastic? I thought my other ones also came with a rubber gasket to really keep moisture out... this one didn't? Nonetheless it works fine and no problems thus far. The 12v outlet is handy for spotlights or small charging devices.
3,Underwhelming,"It maybe that I expected too much from this book, reading so many rave reviews. Having been in the IT consulting industry most of my life I still found few refreshing insights, mixed in with few oddities. The book might be a useful tool, but has to be used critically.As an example: I would certainly not recommend to anyone to downplay the way his/hers professional appearance influences a success in consulting business. Short pants may work for author but your mileage may vary ... A quirk or two might help you project a little of geek or mad scientist trait, but do not take it too far... Lets face it people are more shallow they want to admit and appearances matter.Worth reading if you have a spare time and appreciate alternate point of view, but I would definitely do not keep it as a 'Consulting Reference Bible'."
4,New consultants will benefit from 30 years of experience,"Weinberg, is right. I have to say anyone that wants to hear the straight goods should consider spending the money and the day reading his book. It is simple, VERY entertaining, and to the point."
1,Yuck !,No doubt this is great if you are on a diet and need sugar-free but this stuff taste so artificial and the coloring is way too strong. The sweetness leaves a strange unbearable aftertaste. I'm stuck with 20 tiny boxes and I don't think I'll order these again.
1,I couldnt agree more,"i love van morrisons music, but we are definitley tired of these bang masters under a different name. no problem if van takes a year off, but the studio doesnt need to keep releasing old stuff just to keep his name fresh in peoples minds. hopefully this is the last time"
1,DO NOT buy this book used,"The only thing you buy this book for is the passcode for the online section of the ""Universe"" textbook. A used code that has already been activated will be worthless to you. This book just has an overview of each chapter, it contains no useful information other than the passcode. Its just another way publishers are riping us off. I wasted eight bucks buying a used copy."
4,This book is worth the search . . .but maybe not for kids,"This charmingly frenetic little book is by the gentleman who also penned the saccarine ""Barbar"" series, but you'd never know it. By the looks of it, it is quite expensive to find this out-of-print book, but for those who presevere, a true treasure awaits. The One Pig With Horns is, well--the only pig with horns. He has a big blue coat, a rifle, anger-managerment problems, and he struggles with self-hated, gender confusion and age regression issues. This may be the most hilarious and scary children's book ever. Had de Brunhoff just discovered acid? The big blocky illustrations add to the charm. Find this book--you won't regret it. But you'll probably want to look it over carefully before you read it to the kids. My little brothers and sisters loved it, but this deep gaze into an angry pig's psyche may be too far-out or too weird for some."
5,Great Unit for the Price,"I got this for [...] with a [...] rebate. It is a very nice unit. The speaker and voice is very understandable, its clear and concise. The unit is a 3rd generation processor, grabbing up to 20 satelites when available.I first programmed it to take me to a Walmart about 9 miles away, and it did take me on a rather strange route. But I got there. The speed output matches my speedometer and the altitude readout is nice. In 3d mode, my wife cant keep her eyes off it, always telling me what is off to the side of us. It tells me what resturants and other POI we are passing.In short, this is excellent for the price. Why would anyone spend 500-600 for one of these type units?PS: the documentation is on a disc, and if you want to put MP3's or pictures on the SD drive that comes with it, you will need a card reader. In fact buy a separate sd drive if you want to use it as a cd player"
1,It should have 0 star category for this type of product,"The product looks cute but useless. If you press buttons fast, the unit hangs up. The only way that I know how to get out, is reset the unit. Power down and up again does not fix the problem.I only use the unit few times in last 6 months. Last week, tried to use it again, it died. I could not get the unit power up. Reset does not help. Try to call support...forget it.I learned my lesson. Pay $50 more, get the brandname product!!!"
2,Not worth the low price,"We bought this for just under $200 and returned it. Like another reviewer, we weren'texpecting the greatest for that price, but the thing acts like a Microsoft OS - hangs andcrashes. We needed to reboot often enough that we didn't even try to get service, wejust returned it. The better known models are not that much more expensive."
2,Connector to the GPS,Finally go on a road trip and go to plug in and GPS plug in don't hold tight with the car charger and couldn't use it for the trip. Angry !! I have to pay to ship to Finedigital so they can repair it. I can't get a new GPS System. Only two week old !! Not a very happy camper. Also the outlet plug don't want to charge the system either. Not Happy !! Abram
3,"Nice player, better if it wasn't crippled","short version is that this is a nice mp3 player. Expansion slot for SD, solid construction (battery cover is a bit flimsy though) battery life is long. etc. etc.Biggest drawback that negates all of the above is that they DRM crippled the little thing. It was so nice up until you find out you have to use TDK's proprietory UniFi software. Which unifies nothing. It ""allows"" you to copy mp3s from you system to it. And then they are dead. You can't copy them back, you can't transfer them to anything else. And here's the best part, Windows does not recognize the device unless you install the software.It is all the software as well, if you merely remove the SD card you can move and copy MP3s to it via a reader and the mojo plays them fine. But obviously this doesn't work for the main flash memory. And you need the software to make it work... so unless someone reverse engineers the program, don't buy this."
3,"Mostly pleased, but the uni-fi software is awful","So many things are great about this player -- the size, the ability to expand using SD, the sound. But it is ruined by the horrible software. I am so tired of it freezing up, that I don't bother any more. I just change music on my SD card. I keep looking for a fix from TDK, but there never is one."
4,SharePoint 2003 Training,"This is a great learning aid. Takes you from scratch to quite advanced SPS/WSS administration and customization quickly if you go straight at it, or a little at a time if that's all the time you have. Andre's presentation style is relaxed and idiosynchratic, and adds enormously to the rate at which concepts are picked up. I have often been disappointed by the depth of knowledge that some 'trainers' actually have, but this package is supported by vast in-depth knowledge of the product. My only gripe is that I had to solve a major no-show problem with the Virtual PC image (provided with the training DVD) without support. Pilothouse Consulting recommend 512MB of RAM minimum and were surprised to hear that I was running Virtual PC on a standalone (??). With an upgrade to 1GB and the full retail version of Virtual PC (trial version ships with the DVD) I was on the road - on a standalone. All-in-all, though, no regrets. Hugely useful training package and well recommended."
2,"Virtual PC Training Tutorials! Just forget it, it's garbage",The video tutorials are good but I could not install/use virtual PC training tutorials. It gives all sorts of errors on XP SP2.
4,Good Lab Text,"This is a good introductory inorganic test. It does a great job explaining procedure and theory in the first few chapters.Some of the end of chapter questions are esoteric, especially the literature search ones.The biggest problem is that some of the lab procedures give poor yields when applied. The procedure should be cross-referenced to make sure that it gives the best yield."
5,The title says it all,A great buy for anyone who wants to learn about rock history without falling asleep (which would be very sad considering the topic). I'd buy it more for the humor but you'll come away knowing quite a bit aobut how music evolved and it's history. Browsing the picture captions is worth the price alone.
1,Toilet reading,Waste of time and money. Deoesn't even make for good toilet reading. Have started it a few times but quickly loose interest.
5,Fab!,"Great colour and it's labelled as Made in USA unlike one my husband bought me from UK which was made in China. The crock is made in China, unlike Le Creuset's ceramic products sold in Hong Kong, which are made in China. Very happy with the product. There are still plenty of space to keep other tools in the crock."
3,The container is too small,"My friend purchased one of these a few years back and the container he had was much bigger. I was let down that most of my utensils don't fit in it. However, the spatulas are amazing."
4,Ornamental more than practical,"This set is gorgeous to look at; it adds color to your kitchen. And some times it's actually useful, too.Of the 6 pieces provided (the 7th is the holder itself), I'd say I use probably 3 of them. The basting brush is nice, but it's too small. The two smaller spetulas I doubt I will use regularly since they are just too small. That leaves 3 useful pieces.I'm not as bothered since this came free with my order of the 5-piece cookware set. Otherwise, I won't buy this. There are much better ways to decorate the kitchen."
1,disappointed,"I would expect that I would get the blue set to go along with my 5 piece Le Creuset set, yet you did not offer the color at a reduced price. My entire kitchen is blue so I wanted blue to match."
2,Form before Function,"I received this set as a free gift with the purchase of a French oven. It is very handsome, and the crock is well-made. The spatulas are made of very flexible silicone, which is really too soft to be of much use for anything but scraping thin batter. The spoon collapses under the slightest weight. Even rice is too much for it. An attractive free gift, but I would never buy it."
2,"could be great, but.","I loved the set when it first came. However, I have been using it less than a month (daily use as I cook a lot) and the medium spatula has already cracked. The silicon started cracking about 2 weeks in and it finally bit the dust yesterday. Sad ending to a piece in an otherwise great set."
4,Nice Hat...,This hat is great. It has that worn/faded look to it. I bought it for my son and it was true to size. For $9.99 I would buy it again.
4,Dylan makes it worthwhile,"This soundtrack is excellent in every respesct except one, that being Neil Young's Old Man, probably the least enjoyable song he's ever recorded. The four Dylan tunes, meanwhile, are unbelievable. They provide scope and depth to the movie rather than just being heard in the background. Things Have Changed is an amazing song, full of tell it like it is honesty. It's too bad that it hasn't been heard on the radio, because it's much better than a lot of the trash being masqueraded on the public as rock music these days. It should win an Oscar for best song written for a movie, because no one can realistically expect anything better to come from any pen better than Dylan's."
5,Mellow Music,"This is a really great soundtrack. All of the songs are mellow and make you want to kick back, relax, and listen. The standouts are the four songs by Bob Dylan, including one new one. Neil Young's ""Old Man"" is my other favorite. While all of the songs are mellow, they each evoke something different, and the soundtrack flows well."
3,It was the wrong movie - I was looking for American Beauty.,This is a fine movie...a little slow but ultimately satisfying.It wasn't the movie I was really trying to find. The smoking of high grade weed is the one thing tying these movies together...American Beauty was what I really wanted.
5,This book has a tremendous impact on those who read it.,"I have read literally hundreds of books on topics like leadership, team building, motivation and the like. Beyond Success is clearly one of the best. It is packed full of extremely useful and practical leadership and coaching skills. If more people used Brian's tactics and strategies for building a stronger team in the workplace and a stronger family at home, our lives would be much better balanced...and we would be better people because of it. I've attended Brian's seminars before and the impact he has on people is truly remarkable, and that is because his message has both passion and practicality. One without the other will not move anyone to action, but this book has both in great abundance. If you read this book, you will understand specific actions you need to take to significantly boost your productivity in all facets of your life. I can't recommend it enough."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"What a great book! Brian has PASSION for helping and motivating people to success. His style is both warm and uplifting. I love the stories in this book. Brian teaches you how to find meaningful motivation. A must read!Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated"
3,Mediocre quality.,"First of all this is approximately a 23"" white wax stick (since there is a lack of info). I was hoping to pair this one with my other white wax stick instead of special ordering another one for Escrima. Well when I received it, it has a rather yellowish tint on it. It seems sturdy but it isn't as clean or as machined as well as my other one. There is a slight bend in the quality of the stick and one end is chipped and poorly machined. Oh well, it'll have to do. I just hope this one lasts."
2,if your writing a term paper,"if you need info on the fl. springs for a term paper at school this isyour book. lots of ""deep"" info on springs of florida wildlife, fish, plants, that are in and around the springs. i was looking for moredive info for the springs i haven't been in yet. the pics in the bookare great. thanks for the book mr. stammcapt. rob"
1,weak,"I'm sure Mr. Stamm is a wonderful individual. I feel this needs to be said because it seems that many people take any criticism on an author's work as a personal attack on said author. So, with that out of the way: this book was not for me. I've had it one night and already wish I wouldn't have bought it. It is outdated, poorly put together and incomplete. Stamm includes no additional info on many of the springs he maps. Overall, this book is very frustrating. If you're simply looking for an introduction in to the mere existence of Florida springs, then perhaps this book will be useful. Even then, you can read the book in a single evening and be ready for more by the next morning. Check this book out at the library if you must. However, if you're looking for a detailed guide to the many springs of Florida as a reference with which to plan outings and explorations, keep looking. This book doesn't cut it."
1,"Policewoman, police yourself!","A poorly written pompous piece of self-aggrandizing pap. If Ms. Harrington has such an ax to grind against the police patriarchy, why did she remain in policing for so long? Perhaps she should look within for answers instead of tilting against ever politically correct windmill in sight."
1,Get the shredder humming for this one.,"Awful. Among the chapters you should be sure NOT to read-- ""In Uniform and In Charge!""."
5,Bird and Diz fly high on this set of sheer pure bebop beauty,"There seems to be less bird and diz music sets than some fans and musicians might like to access. I am a Jazz Alto sax player who takes over from where Parker left off, but even with my extensive Parker LPs, tapes, and CDs, only three are specifically the two founders of Bebop playing together. Other old LPs have lots of takes but you have to guess, quite often, that it is dizzy on trumpet. No big problem for me, but new fans and music students might have some difficulty. If I had tons of money, I would buy ""Jazz AT Massey Hall by The Quintet"" in quantity and send it to every middle school music department. Charles Christopher Parker invented modern music, and as Charles Bukowski wrote, guys like Charlie Parker and J.S. Bach usually show up about once every century or two."
5,Very Essential,"I Got tons of stuff on Bird,Mingus,a few on Powell&Roach&a few on Dizzy.but having all of that Genius on Set makes up big time.The Music&Arrangements are Incredible.Bird changed the Game Forever.He is One Of Jazz's Greatest Pioneers.DIzzy blows The Mind with His Tone.Miles Davis always gave him Mad Props.Roach is one of the Greatest Drummers ever in any Style of Music.Powell Rings up Keys&has been featured on Many Important Recordings.Mingus who I got turned onto a Couple Years back is Amazing.Simply put.His Tones&Drives are Gold too the Ears.Very Essential."
3,half the concert,"this disc has only half the concert. the cd issued by ""past perfect"" entitled ""massey hall toronto 53"" has the same six songs PLUS six more, incl a pretty sweet version of ""embraceable you"". mind you, the bonus tracks don't have bird and diz blowing. it's ""just"" the rhythm section. but what a rhythm section! sound quality is just as good (or bad).the concert itself is ok. like some other reviewers have mentioned, the group doesn't always play as one unit. the best track is ""wee"". they sound like they're playing together there. ""perdido"" and ""night in tunisia"" are also pretty good. but on ""hot house"" and ""all the things you are"" they never sound like they have it together. and on ""salt peanuts"", bird and diz are stepping on each other's toes.minus one star for not putting the whole concert on this disc. and minus another for the sometimes disjointed playing."
4,The bible of bop,"It was still at least a decade later that Jazz would expand its vocabulary to keep things consistently fresh, but as far as old-time, live bebop is concerned, it's hard to think of a better starting, and finishing, point than this."
1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed with my order experience for this product. The unit quantity was listed as a case of 12 1.5 pound packages. I received a shipment that only included one 1.5 pound box of lentils. After calling the help line to get the problem corrected, I was assurred the problem would be corrected. When my second shipment arrived, it contained only another 1.5 pound box of lentils. I called again, and was refunded the difference. All I wanted was what I ordered, which I never got. Very frustrating."
4,Great Backgroud Study,"WOW! The album really fleshes out Marvin, Trina and their relationship. This album does not quite fit stylistically with ""March of the Falsettos"" or ""Falsettos."" But musically and stylistically it's far ahead of what one would expect for an album recorded in 1978. A ""must have"" as far as I'm concerned -- especially if you are familiar with its sucessors. Of note: This CD includes a recording of ""I'm Breaking Down,"" Trina's Mad Aria from ""Falsettoland"" which is not included on the ""March of the Falsettos"" album. Allison Fraser does it w/ gusto!"
5,Funny Operetta,"I love Eric Idle and he is great in this operetta. It is updated to the 1930's, but then they could include some tap dancing. It takes nothing away from the story or the music to make it more modern. Even the song about the ""list"" is funnier because it includes now-a-day types. I recommend this to Gilbert and Sullivan fans, and Eric Idle fans."
5,Buy this disc!!,"I first heard this CD while motoring out into Key Biscayne on a flawless Miami morning. The girls were dancing topless on the front deck, the breeze was flying past, a grin spread out across each of our faces, and this music captured it all in one, big fat juicy groove that just kept going on and on..."
5,Great quality,"This is a great quality product, works fine for connecting my router to my bluray player, no connection problems or signal loss to date!"
3,"It has a good plot and is very imaginative, but lacking...","This is a very good example of a fictional plot: characters are wonderful, adventure, fairy creatures, magic and a princess and prince who save the day. The only problem is reading it is like reading a stone. It is flat at many spots. The author gets descriptive at insignificant parts and flat during major parts. It is as if while he was writing it, he got so caught up in his own story, he left out many details. But he makes up for it with a wonderful plot and a good romantic character in it. All in all, it was time well spent."
2,"nice start ,but dies by mid book","The start of the story was very good, but by the middle of the book it just limps along. The main characters kept second guessing what they had done. This gets old fast. Skip this one."
2,Saints by whose criteria?,"Having glanced through the book I became unsure of of the credentials of the persona within. Seeing descriptions like ""the first feminist"" and references to alchemy made me feel uneasy. The Czar Nickolas listed as a saint also caught me as slightly odd. Looking at the back cover I see that the author has also written book(s) on witches and witchcraft. I personally don't think one can be true to both genres. Look elsewhere for a book of saints."
5,It's good,It tells about Saints and stuff but some weird stuff... It's very good I think you all should get it. It sort of has random stuff with numbers and is very weird like I said so GET IT
5,Wonderful Book on the Saints,"This is a wonderful book, which should grace anyone's library, who collects information on the Catholic Saints. I particularly liked its format, as well as the cover, etc."
2,A mouse for a Superman,"The mouse works well. A mere click turns it on, without a complex and confusing setup process. In that respect I cannot complain. You start working with it and get excited that it works so well, without any problems, that you cannot believe. But you quickly notice that it is heavy, and in less than five minutes your hand drops dead. Oh boy! It feels like you are moving a ton of bricks. I went back to my corded mouse, a cheap Ativa, which, even if it is not as good, I can move with ease. I gave the Philips mouse two stars because it works very well, but you need superpowers to move it after a while."
2,cowboy boot charm,The charm did not arrive in a timely manner after purchase and the charm was flat on one side with the design on the other side only. The description given could have been better explaining the design of the charm. Most likely will not purchase from this site again in the future.
4,It's How You Play the Game,"I bought this as a gift, but I read it before I wrapped it. I enjoyed the book. Nice ""light"" reading"
4,Good and tough - fast-paced and quick.,"At first I thought it was going to be slow and not very tough. But then I was sweating in no time flat (I'm out of shape, but not overweight). Marian went a little fast (for me, since this is the first time I've worked out in over a year) but I was able to keep up for the most part."
1,Not orginal hits,"How is it possible that Mr. Jones' major attribute -- his big brassy voice -- can sound so sad and weak? I can only guess that these recordings were live, late and cheap. Find some other Greatest Hits -- there are plenty to chose from..."
3,Tent Review,"Tent DOES NOT meet the hieght specifications as labled of 6 feet. This was the main reason I bought this tent was due to the height, it is more like 5'5"" + or -. Very disapointed in that aspect but other than that a good tent and worth the money."
4,More Of The Meaningless Mercury Compilations,"The Only thing that made me give this CD 4 stars was because of Reba's enormous talent, otherwise this is a meaningless compilation with songs randomly slapped together."
2,overcompressed remastering,"Musically, I would give this CD 5 stars for 'Rockit'the seminal track that fused DJ scratching with Herbie'sjazz tinged analog synthesizer experiments over a drummachine. The amazing remix 'Rockit (Megamix)' is alsoquite stunning with some very creative use of samples(ahead of its time).The problem is that whoever remastered the music followsthe modern trend of overcompressing the music, drainingall dynamic range out of it to increase the apparent loudness.This makes the music jump out at you, but it's verytiresome on the ears and drains the life out of it.Personally, I can't even listen to the CD anymore.I would recommend prospective buyers pick up one of the oldschool hip hop compilations with Rockit on it instead(the other tracks on the LP/CD haven't aged as well)"
4,Good Disc,"this disc reflects the many different styles of music that the Genius mind of Herbie Hancock would venture into.some things have worked others have not.he got a good mix on this set.especially with ROCKIT.this is his answer to HIP-Hop and also to Mile's On The Corner album.give Herbie credit he had better Luck staying Contempary than COrea,Cobham&even Miles.the 80's weren't to kind to real JAzz Musicians.with all the Synths&Drum Machines it hurt the Music alot&watered it down.but Herbie has been bad for a LOng,Long,time.i like his risk taking.for better or worse."
5,DO YOU NEED TO ASK?,"IF THE NAME HERBIE HANCOCK DOESN'T GET YOU TO BUY IT,THEN ""ROCK IT' MUST. REMEMBER THE VIDEO?"
5,An Great book!,"This book truly is an inspiration! It is not only action-packed but its also profound, with the perfect balance! I think the author reveals the internal struggle within the protagonist perfectly. The book was a quick read even though it was almost 450 pages long, i read it in a week! This defintely makes my top 10 favorite books."
2,STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK,"I did not enjoy reading this book at all. I felt it was very poorly written, and unprofessionally put together. The plot at times was at times ruff edged, and the authors ideas did not have a flow to them. Along with the poor plot, the homosexual references throughout the novel were ill called for and, at times, unfound. The sheer length of the book was totally unnecessary, for a boring story like this could be told over a fire in less than 10 minutes. This is a story that belongs around the camp fire, instead of selling (or not selling rather) for $25, paperback at that. I do not recommend this book, no doubt written will running from boarder patrol, to any innocent fantasy story seeker, or educated novel reader.4 shizzel"
5,The Mighty Mighty Dells,"I love this CD. I have the original ""Oh What A Nite"" on the Vee-Jay label. I still play this album alot. My favorite song is ""Why Do You Have To Go"". The Dells back then showed the world how talented they were back then THey wrote mostly all of the songs on thier debut album. Of course the classic ""Oh What A Night"" stand on its own. This is for doo-wop lovers only. Vee-Jay records had the best in thier fold."
3,Not what I expected ...,"I sent the book back because it did not offer me any new information. However, someone just starting out, may find it to be a helpful primer to their Graphic Design foundation."
1,Don't Buy These Gloves,"Just received Ragg Wool Gloves and am very disappointed with the quality of the workmanship. Between the fourth and fifth fingers, the thread ended on both left and right glove. Pull the thread and the fingers pull together. I e-mailed the vendor but no response. Luckly I purchased the gloves via Amazon and will send them back and let Amazon fight it out with the seller. Why can't we buy clothing that is made with quality and pride? Before you say it is because the product was made in China, the gloves have a tag on them proudly stating,""Made In America."""
3,Pizza Peel,"Peel is OK given it's the lower end of the price range. One note...it's not very tough wood, so if you use a pizza cutter it will indent the wood. However, I dont mind this and use one side for sliding the raw pizza in and the other for taking it out & the dents and cuts give it character."
2,Too much resistance,"Next time I would choose an aluminum peel so the unbaked pizza dough slides off better. But, it does make a good decoration!"
3,nice looking but creates an excess of lint,"This is a very nice looking rug; great accent to a room color-wise, but it leaves behind a lot of lint. I bought this rug in Aug of 2011 for my living room but I have been shopping for a new rug because of the lint problem. The more the rug is walked on, played on (we have 3 60+ lb dogs), or otherwise touched, an excess amount of lint and fuzz is released from the rug and tracked all over the house. I have to empty my vacuum bag (we have a Kenmore model# 21514) at least one time when I vacuum on and around the rug (wood floors). Beautiful looking rug, unique, but not worth the hassle of cleanup."
2,I wanted more dirt,"If you want to hear droning stories about British theatre life, then this is your baby. However, if you're hoping for some juicy revelations about Peter O'Toole, look someplace else. What a crushing disappointment this is. Sian was married to O'Toole for 20 years and during the height of his world-wide fame. She was with him during his breakthrough role as Lawrence of Arabia, in Becket, Goodbye Mr. Chips, and all his other stellar 60's roles. I expected gobs of gossip on Taylor and Burton, but Sian merely relates Peter's drinking binges with Burton and the fact Kate Hepburn referred to Liz and Richard as ""fat pigs.""And what about O'Toole's drinking? As one of the most famous drunk actors of all time, in the league of Lee Marvin, Burton, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, I expected some fireworks in this area. Forget it. Sian clinically describes Peter's addictions, his out of control lifestyle and racing cars, but it's all told in a desperately dry manner. All very disappointing."
2,Very Very Basic- good for the absolute begineer,I found this DVD to be way too basic and slow. I believe it is geared at the absolute beginner who has never turned on a sewing machine. The extremely slow pace that Bob Martin speaks only made me sleepy but did inspire me to start writing reviews.
2,Couldn't get through it,"I borrowed this set from the library and found it to be very, very slow and basic with poor grammar."
3,Dog Treats A-Okay,"We shared these with our visiting dogs during weekly pet therapy visits - Although I have not a clue how they REALLY taste, the pup seemed to chomp a stamp of approval. I like that these are all natural and from a local distributor."
5,This stuff is like chocolate for dogs or something!,Dogs just go crazy over these treats. I go online and buy 2 cases of 12 and that lasts 2 years for my 2 pugs and 1 yorkie.
5,Very fun movie collection,The first home alone movie was absolutely original family fun where a kid is left alone at home by accident and is the target of two bumbling burglars and now he must foil the burglars' plans.The second one is even better with Kevin getting on the wrong plane and ends up in New York City but is the target of the same dodo criminals once again and now he must pull off more shenanigans to foil the thieves' attempt to get even with him.The third one felt completely detached from the first two. A totally different character this time is on his own at home but is unaware that his toy car has been planted with a special top secret device and international criminals want to get their hands on it before the law does and now he must prevent them from getting it.
2,"Not the typical ""romance""","Annette Lamb has creative ideas for her characters, but sadly the plot was wrecked by their inconsistentcies. The heroine is manipulative and thoroughly confused...Alpin would definitely be branded as a flake in today's society. As for Alpin's leading man-Malcolm-He had a knack of changing his personality constantly, and I felt only pity for this character. I also found the lack of respect for the religious content aggravating and offensive. I felt I couldn't grasp any sort of interest with the book... I truly prefer the novels by the following authors: Elizabeth Lowell, Julie Garwood, and Iris Johansen."
2,"Good beginning, horrible ending","***SPOILER WARNING***In the beginning, each of the heroes wanted to deceive the other. Malcom, however, outgrew his need for revenge, managed to forgive Alpin and tried to make a happy future for both of them. The heroine was horrible. She behaved childishly, never told Malcom what she wanted and what was wrong, didn't believe him when he told her that he loved her and jumped to stupid conclusions. She tried to run away from him - not once, but five or six times. It was horrible. And then Malcom behaved as if he had no back bone at all - he always brought her back, didn't even give her a proper tongue-lashing, but just put up with her behavior. I wished he would just let her go and find another woman. I don't know how he could love such a selfish, childish creature. In the end, I lost all respect for him. I had to force myself to finish the book."
2,Just Too Boring...,"Compared to Border Lord, this book was a drag. Very boring. The characters were flat, and just not interesting in any way. I hate to say that because I love Arnette Lamb's books, and this annoyed me no end to read such a bad book."
5,The Big Three,"If you're a fan of Cass Elliot you owe it to yourself to treat yourself to this album. It's an eclectic mixture of folk songs...some from your childhood like ""All the Pretty Little Horses"" and some foreign ones like my personal favorite, the haunting ""Silkie"". Throughout the collection, Cass's beautiful clear voice rings through. The Big Three used to play at the Cellar Door in Georgetown (DC) and when I went to college in 1965, this was the album that was constantly played in the dorm...we even took it to painting class! We literally wore the grooves off of it, which is why I'm so delighted that it's been reproduced on CD."
3,Big 3 with Mama Cass a reflection of early 60's folk revival,"If you like the early 60's folk style, you will enjoy this album. However, it is not as rich, as say, a Kingston trio album of the the same era. It has some unique arrangements of traditional songs. The orchestration is thin as are many of the genre of this era. Overall, I found it to be interesting, but not a real winner."
5,NO CHEMICALS,MY SON RAVES ABOUT THIS SO GOT A BOTTLE FOR EACH OF MY EIGHT GRANDCHILDREN. STAYS ON ALL DAY...NO HARSH CHEMICALS.
5,Blue Lizzard Success,Fantastic results. Goes on very thick with minimal need for reapplication. No burns! Definitely worth the extra few dollars for this product.
4,Goes on very nicely,"I wanted a physical rather than chemical sunblock for my toddler, and I tried several. The Blue Lizard is my favorite so far. It goes on very smooth and creamy, and so is easy to rub in. It does have a white tint if you put it on heavily (which I think maybe you're supposed to do, but we don't). It's a little pricey, but not compared to some of the really expensive physical sunblocks out there; and it's nicer to apply than cheaper ones I've tried."
4,Product as expected,"I am happy with this product, will warn that it is a bit thick and doesn't apply like other sunscreens I've used but that minor change is worth it for the extra protection on my fair skinned daughter."
2,Not so mild.,"My daughter has a mild eczema on her elbows and knees.It gets worse if I use any soaps/cleasers other than Cetaphil.I bought this sunscreen because I heard that it was very mild.Wrong, at least for my daughter. She had rash all over her arms.Before, she used Coppertone and Aveeno without any problem. I am going back to Aveeno."
4,It's great,"I love how this product is really waterproof without the greasy feeling. Also, the bottle changing color is pretty cool ."
1,Old product,"I am very disappointed that Amazon sent me a suncream which is almost expired. You can notice that this suncream was made a long time ago just looking at the case.I received it yesterday, and the expiration date is Aug 2008. I just have 5 months to use it until it is expired.I believe Amazon should not sell cosmetics with this upcoming expiration date."
2,Allergic Reactions,"Because of positive reviews in various places, I bought a gallon of this stuff for my extended to family to use while we were up in the mountains. While my kids seem to respond to it fine, both of my brothers, my wife and I all had pretty strong reactions to it after a few days - our skin dried and flaked. If so many of us hadn't been using it we probably wouldn't have recognized the problem.I'm not sure of the reason, though I am at least a little concerned that micronized zinc oxide is used. The micronization makes it disappear into the skin, but I know it also changes the chemical properties of metals. Could be totally unrelated, but no matter, I now have a gallon of sunscreen I won't be using."
1,Parabens,Reading a review from the smaller bottle it mentioned that there are parabens listed in the ingredients event though the product is listed as chemical free. I called the company directly and they said parabens were taken out of their ingredients a year ago. This product does list the parabens so this must be an old bottle. They said the only way to guarantee a new bottle without parabens is to order from their website directly: [...]
5,Great,"Love this product, now that I have been with my baby out in the pool several times now I can say it definitly works!"
2,Previews had more depth than the film,"After watching the trailer, I was hooked. After watching the film, I had buyers remorse. This film needs a lot more development. Very good premise, not very good execution. I would not recommend spending your money on this film."
1,Very difficult to get into. BORING,This movie is boring and makes no sense. It was a waste of my time and my money. Don't bother.
2,too slow,i cant believe how slow & boring this movie is & i have absolutely interest in any of the characters. the little bits from the trailer are the best parts for sure not finished watching it yet and its a monumental struggle.
4,One of the most romantic CD's ever made,"I was given this CD as a gift from a boyfriend and even though we broke up, I still love the CD. K-Ci and JoJo really know how to capture the emotions and fears a person goes through when they are in love. It is a Cd that I can listen to in any mood and still smile. One of my all time favorite Cd's."
5,ALL THE SONGS ARE GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"A lot of people probably bought this CD because of the ""All my life"". So did I. But when I went on a long car trip to Orlando it was the only CD I brought with me on accident. So I listened to the whole thing and was very suprised! All of the songs we're very good and leave very good messages. Like ""Don't Rush"" witch teaches young teens not to have sex the first night. My favorite song is ""Bring me down"". This is without a doubt, one of the best R&B CD's ever made! Good luck in 1999 K-ci&JoJo!!!"
5,The Best,I Think That This Is The Best Love Song CD Ever In The History Of Mankind And Nothing Can Top It Period..
4,all my life i have never heard a more precious CD.,"This cd is so cool. the hailey brothas are so fine. in all of my life i have never heard a better band than them. so go out and buy the cd. laterz. Hey a.j., r.d., s.o., e.h., and t.l. and n.g. oh and c.m."
5,THE BEST CD AND SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,WHEN I FIRST THIS SONG I FELLING IN WITH THE WORDS. I KNEW THIS SONG WOULD BE MY WEDDING SONG THAT I WAS BRAGGING ABOUT TO MY FRENZ AND FAMILY.
4,Keep It Real!!!!!!!!!,"Your song 'Don't Rush' is just want our generation needs to be hearing. I'm glad you guys came out with that song because you shouldn't rush into anything especially when you don't know enough or nothing about it. Keep doing want your doing.Just a fan , Demetrice"
4,It's great,K-ci and Jojo just have the voices to make every one want them. The always come up with real good lyrics. It's a great cd!
2,Sure This will piss someone off...,"Why on earth would I give this CD 2 stars? Well to put it simply, this album has only a handful of songs that I would listen to on a regular basis,(most notable being All My Life). The songs are boring and K-Ci's rough voice eventually drives me insane. If you really like this album, only get the single. You are far better off."
1,how could you,how could you baby come backgirl here come again how much do i cry i wanna get to knowmama song all my lifetell me it real
5,THIS CD IS ALL THAT!,"I DON'T THINK THAT YOU WILL EVER GET TIRED OF HEARING THIS. WHEN YOU HEAR K-CI ON LOVE ALWAYS, YOU WOULD WANT TO PLAY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THAT ALSO GOES FOR JOJO ON ALL MY LIFE. THIS WHOLE CD IS BANGING!"
5,Now this is great music. . .,"Love Always is a classic. If you don't have it, you should've had it a long time ago. There isn't a bad song on the record, there isn't a bad verse on the record. My absolute favorite is Don't Rush. Nothing more to say, go get it."
5,Supreme,K-Ci and Jojo deserve all the praise they are receiving at the moment! All my life is definately the no. 1 love song ever! Congrats to all smart enough to buy the album. Can't wait for their next one!
2,"I REALLY LIKE THE SONG ""ALL MY LIFE""","I REALLY LIKE THE SONG""ALL MY LIFE"" ME AND MY FRIENDS LISTEN TO IT ALL THE TIME EVERY SINGLE DAY EVEN WHEN WE STAY UP IT IS A COOL SONG"

1,How did this get published?,"Absolutely dreadful writing. Far too verbose with shallow characters and a weak plot.On a positive note, it gives me hope that one day I can get published."
1,Awful Drivel- I don't know why I finished it,"Geinuses of Crack is one of the worst novels I've ever read. It was so bad that I had to go online to check out other reviews and see if it was just me or if the book was this pathetic. I'm an avid reader and read everything from biographies, to suspense/adventure/horror/sci-fi novels. I'm also a musician and did the band thing at the same time as the story setting. I was hoping to find a nice novel to reminisce too.Was I ever wrong. The whole novel has a horrible literary style...constantly name/product dropping, as if the author would identify an object in the book (i.e. atari 2600) and then go into excruciating detail to describe the object. The book went nowhere, and worse yet, it took forever to get there. I highly recommend avoiding this garbage- it was sad that trees had to be killed to produce this mess."
3,Still trying to sum up the average parts of our generation,"With Geniuses of Crack (and you never do find out what the title means, unlike Our Noise), Jeff Gomez has returned to the same GenX well. Though the premise is fascinating, the execution of continuing where Our Noise left off is less satisfying that say, Tales of the City. For starters, the characters he picks are the least interesting from Our Noise (and very interchangable-are last names that difficult?). You never find out what the band is supposed to sound like, and the relationships are all transitory. Carping aside, Gomez is making a valiant effort to penetrate the mores of a most-misunderstood generation, and you get the sense he cares about the foibles of his characters. Perhaps next time he can find a different patron than Bret Easton Ellis-hell, maybe even Henry James."
1,"dreadful ""writing""","The ""typist"" of this book should go back to his day-job. Great idea, wrong ""author."" Un-forgivably bad writing."
1,Ridiculous Redux: Gomez Pens Another,"""`Chapter One,' he found himself saying, walking around the apartment, repeating, `chapter one. . . [sic]' When it came time to follow these words with a story, characters, and dialog, he was stumped. That was why he did not take up writing"" (p. 218). This seems as apt a description of Jeff Gomez as any, and, penned as it is by Gomez himself, one wonders why he did, of all things, ""take up writing,"" and then, to compound that initial mistake, choose to follow-up his ludicrously unaccomplished first novel, Our Noise (1995) with this equally dull, inept, and useless second novel, Geniuses of Crack."
1,chickens,"Geniuses of Crack is a good idea, hijacked by a terrible writer. This word comes to mind: verbose. Gomez is one writer who should not quit his day job. Reading this book, I was reminded of chickens; small brains, lots of noise. Not to say Gomez has a small brain; in fact he's obviously an intelligent man; the problem is with his fingers: they don't belong anywhere near a keyboard."
1,Gomez must be on crack,"This book is an absolute affront to everything. Gomez seemingly doesn't even have enough talent to rise to the level of sensationalism. Indeed, the only redeeming quality of this book is that it may give a number of fourth graders around the country hope that they too can get published. Do yourself a favor, if you want a mindless read, pick up the TV guide."
5,A short review,"In honor of the brevity of most of the songs on ""Dirty Sanchez,"" I've decided to keep my review brief. The songs are extremly short, extremely fast, and extremely intense in every way. It redeems rock and roll in so many ways. If that doesn't appeal to you, go die you hippie scum."
5,Probably the best thing that Epitaph ever put out.,"How did Zeke ever get signed to the label anyway? Well, you won't hear any third-rate Bad Religion/NOFX clone music, just rippin' hardcore punk with great fast riffs. They even managed to make a Fleetwood Mac song kick ass (there's an unlisted cover of ""Rhiannon"" at the end of the CD)."
1,We readers do not need this,"Guyatt sees the fight against tyranny as an evil threat. And it is always a good idea to ask ourselves if we are acting reasonably. But Guyatt himself is not reasonable, and he's proved it with wild misrepresentations of reality. It has to be right to fight against tyranny, and it does not help to pretend that people who oppose tyranny are always Wrong."
5,Awesome training resource!,"Dr Ross has done an impressive job of putting the research into a usable resource for cyclists. His ideas are newer and different than some of the traditional training approaches. For example, he talks about making training more effective by using intensity in workouts instead of just slow base miles. He explains how his theories maximize the body's natural ability to maintain hormones that improve performance. My performance has improved due to this book, and so has the performance of many of my friends. Additionally, my bike fit is much better. This is the only book of its kind written by a physician and is a worthwhile investment. Any serious or competitive cyclist should have this book in their library. I also highly reccomend Dr Ross' other book Sports Medicine for Endurance Athletes."
4,Solid reggae from a classical rootsical vocalist,"Ya Man! This cd contains some solid reggae roots and lovers rock grooves. Definitely check this out for the price. I found this gem at a thrift store in central NY, $2! Bless up!"
3,"Another fine, but puzzling, effort","I have only one complaint. Why team up with Karen King? Why team up at all? No doubt there's a damn good reason. King can read the original Coptic/Aramaic/Greek/whatever? King wasn't busy? King wanted a larger readership? But I would have so preferred Pagels on her own. King makes unproven ""historical"" leaps that bother me...like calling Mary Magdalene Mary of Magdala with no proof at all. In fact with a lot of evidence there was no city actually called Magdala in Mary's time. And to find Elaine parroting this...call me disappointed. For this, I offer a Pagels book only three stars where I would usually offer five. As for the material, it's elegantly presented, easily absorbed, and full of implications for the myth-life-truth of Christ. And a cherry on the pie: the Gospel of Judas and its tale of offering up one's good name was anticipated by my still favorite book on Mary Magdalene, Longfellow'sThe Secret Magdalene: A Novel."
1,Hogwash,"After Judas hanged himself (Matthew) and/or dove into a field and ""busted himself open"" (Acts), when exactly, in death, did he find the time to write his gospel?"
4,The other side of the story for Judas Iscariot?,"I would summarize my thoughts on this book by paraphrasing the authors: ""The Gnostic gospels, including the Gospel of Judas, do not belong in the Christian canon, nor do they belong in the trash. They are an essential part of Christian history.""The canon (modern Bible) was originally formed as part of an attempt to unify a religion that was very diverse at the time, and the Gnostic gospels provide proof of that diversity. They also add an enlightening perspective on theological issues that are still pondered by many of today's most serious students of Christianity.As one of those students, I purposefully read those works that are considered ""unorthodox"" or ""heretical,"" such as the Gnostic gospels. Almost without fail, this open-minded approach always provides me with a broader historical understanding and a deeper spiritual revelation. It also ignites additional questions ... and more searching!"
3,Not so so interesting,"I was very excited about this book since I am big breasted and wanted to reduce my chest. But very dissapointed when the book arrived :1. The format is very unfriendly. Small - quarter size of an A4 paper.2. The book opens verticaly like a writing pad. This makes handling difficult.3. The photos are black and white and look quite old.4. The exercises should be done together with other workouts (which are not included in the book.I am giving only 3 stars because some of the exercises are quite helpful and specific to the bust. If the author publishes this book in a new user-frient=dly format, it will be a better buy."
5,Great Book!,I think this book needs to be in the hands of every Christian. 'The Father's Blessing' contains many great teachings about the love of God which everyone needs.
5,The Fathers Blessing,this is a great book written 18 months into a move of God that almost 16 years later is still impacting the world. John Arnott's gentle spirit comes through and this book will be cherished long after the detractors' comments are forgotten.
1,Local Questions details in book !!!,"After being in attendance at TCAF, it's difficult to believe some of the details reported. Some one has clearly stretched the facts or at least twisted the truth. This book is clearly dated and no longer reflects the Toronto Experience."
4,I like it,Good Selection of songs. Missing a lot of other good smooth jazz song I think should have been on this CD. Good quality sound
1,Sabrina,"Well, I thought this book was mildly interesting. I was very bored in the middle. It also was poorly written, and hard for me to understand. It was lacking the sense of adventure I usually see in the Sabrina series."
4,The girl next door,"For several years of my life, I lived next door to the house where this movie was filmed. The characters in the movie actually used my old driveway as their own. Living in New Bedford a good part of my life, I found the opening scene of New Bedford Harbor breathtaking and it really touch my heart. The movie is very romantic. If you love romance movies or novels, I'm sure that you will not be disappointed. My favorite scene, next to the opening one of New Bedford Harbor, is when all the characters are at the Portuguese Feast. Having gone to the Portuguese Feast in New Bedford year after year, it was interesting to watch. This is a very different, refreshing, romantic movie that I really enjoyed."
2,This film was FAR from anything special,"This film was FAR from anything special, but it was still somewhat enjoyable. There are some flaws concerning the Portuguese culture, but ROSSUM's and MILOS's performances seem to make up for them. Over all I give it two stars. It's an AVERAGE film."
2,"Good story, Poor male actor performance (Jason Isaacs)","This is a nice story, very romantic set in a beautiful scenery. I enjoyed the beginning of the movie, but as the story unfolds the male character becomes more and more pathetic. The actress Sofia Milos is fantastic and Jason Isaacs is just not a match for her in this movie. The director should have chosen an actor with temperament. In certain scenes he is overacting a lot and in the love scene he is almost ""slimey"".For the story and female actor it`s worth watching, but do not expect much."
3,Disappointed,"I am as big a fan of romances as the next poor sap but this one failed my expectations in too many ways: mostly direction and screen writing I suppose. Emmy Rossum always adds a happy, sweet, bright flash of enthusiasm to the movies she appears in but her character loses the thread in the plot halfway thru.Milos is gorgeous but she's leaden in this role, much as she is in CSI Miami, mostly just walking around looking good, but uninspired. And if she can sing, it still looks like she's lip-synching.Isaacs is pretty good until he loses all dignity and starts groveling.But I loved New Bedford, Massachusetts!"
3,Isaacs is miscast here!,"This chick flick is a waste of the talented Jason Isaacs who is badly cast and wearing an ugly wig to boot. It has a lot of great location shots of New Bedford, Portuquese cuisine fit for Cooks Illustrated and talented cast trying their best with a very thin story line.I am a great fan of Isaacs but he is kinda cringe inducing here (especially since he has publically stated how much he hates fish)! Do yourself a favor and watch The Patriot, season 1 of the Brotherhood or one of Harry Potters with Lucius Malfoy in it, JI excells as a badboy!"
3,Passionada,"A love story, my purpose in purchasing Passionada was to view the setting in the fishing towns of New England and Azorian customs. Beautiful!"
