5,"One of the great ""serious"" entertainments","Lonesome Dove is that rare thing, a serious novel that is, inall its parts, fabuloulsy entertaining. Larry McMurtry sets himselfthe seemingly impossible task of summing up the entire western genre in one book, and succeeds brilliantly. This novel has every stock western character and plot device: cattle drives, rattlesnakes, Mexican bandits, Texas Rangers, renegade Indians, gamblers, whores (with hearts of gold), riverboat men, wagon trains, sod busters, gun fights, fist fights, hangin', burnin' and much, much more. The book is brilliantly written with both humor and intelligence, causing the reader to care deeply about the fate of the main characters even while laughing out loud at the dialogue.This is the masterpiece of McMurtry's long and distinguished career. No one, not even him, is going to top this as the ultimate western. For those who haven't read it, I can't recommend it highly enough."
1,NOT ENOUGH ENDURANCE TO SLOG THROUGH THIS,"For God's sake can't there be any accurate reviews? I only bought it because of the positive reviews but if I'd had even a hint of how slow, boring and uninteresting this was I wouldn't be out 8 bucks now."
5,A Book You'll Want to Reread Several Times...,"Truly loved this novel and like other reviewer have said, it's too short! I knew I would miss the characters (especially Gus McRae) so I bought the 2 prequels and the sequel even before I finished the book. Above all else, it's about people coming to terms with their own humanity and their own mistakes. None of the characters ended up as I might have predicted--kudos to McMurtry for not creating a predictable storyline! Looking forward to the other books and also the miniseries."
5,A classic in every sense of the word,"What more can be said about this novel that hasn't been said already? Not much, other than to reiterate the overwhelming feeling from the reviewers on Amazon that this is a truly great book that demands you to read it. To be immersed in the wonderful characters and settings of McMurtry's West is a true pleasure. Lots of pages, yes, but not a word wasted. Just read it!"
5,Reincarnation,"This work makes me think that the author must have been reincarnated from this time. The reader is right there. A clearer picture of the times cannot be written with words. I live and was born in Texas and have travled many roads of that state throughout my life. Even after Dallas, Waco and our recent president it makes me proud to be part of this state. It is the best western I have ever read (or seen) and believe me I could be considered a fanatic on the subject. If you want to feel your emotions read this book or see the movie or both. Hats of to Mr McMurtry. If I could give him a award I would."
3,Mixed feelings,"It's obvious from the very first paragraph that this book is extremely well-written in a simple and straightforward prose style, and as one gets deeper into it it also becomes obvious that the characterizations are rich and beautifully realized and the dialogue authentic and genuine. That said, regardless of the fact that it won a Pulitzer prize (so did ""The Road"" and that was awful - and in my case, unreadable after about 10 chapters), reading Lonesome Dove is still sometimes rather laborious and boring. The plotting in this tome is quite plodding. It simply takes too long to get where it's going - and boiled down, it's really just a rescue story. I enjoyed it, but there were times when I wished McMurtry would just get on with it and I was tempted to skip ahead."
5,A magnificent must-read!,"I hate to merely add another stellar review to the list but this book moved me so much, I had to express my feelings.Next to ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"" this is my favorite novel. The description is detailed but not overdone, the dialogue is both laugh-out-loud funny and heartbreaking, and the characters are so rich, you truly feel as if you've gotten to know them. You can feel and see everything in ""Lonesome Dove"" come to life as if you were there, it is that sweeping and cinematic. I have seldom gotten so involved in a novel and so attached to so many vivid characters. But while thoroughly entertaining me, the book had me looking inward as well.Don't be scared off if you don't read Westerns. This book is for anyone who enjoys a marvelous, beautifully told story and a stirring, thought-provoking reading experience. I hated the book to end but it will stay with me for a very long time."
5,"Lonesome Dove: a memorial epic, the best book ever written!","This 945 page journey through America's past in the wildest western territory is a definite must-read. The characters are so real that when certain events occur to them the reader can feel it themselves. My favorite characters are numbered many: Newt, Pea Eye, Gus, Deets, Lorie, and Roscoe Brown. I think the best part of the book is when Gus and Clara are reunited after their sixteen year separation. Gus's witticisms always make me laugh each and every time I read the book, which has been about six times total now. This is the type of epic where, each new time you read it, you derive a bit more information from the story. I have also read other books by Larry McMurtry, and they, also, are wonderfully written. Readers of nearly any age could enjoy this book. Age doesn't matter, because I am only fifteen years old. I highly recommend reading Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove. by: Kate Hoover"
5,Must Read,"Lonesome Dove is my favorite book of all time. I have not read it in 5 years or so and I have a few additions of it, but I love it so much I am going to repurchase this addition. It is truly an amazing adventure."
5,love it,"the lives of retired rangers their story, on a journey on the trip to montana, the lost of one of them. and story of the other taking him home."
5,perfect,I simply could not set it down. Its rare that a literary work is this funny. This is a great story told deftly.
5,10 stars? The cowboy book that won the Pulitzer,"To say Larry McMurtry writes about cowboys is like saying Melville wrote about fish. Only a writer of McMurtry's skill and stature could have written a book about a couple of drunken and inarticulate Texas Rangers turned horse rustlers and have it become, right before your eyes, into an epic, mythic saga of redemption, conviction, friendship, responsibility, and quiet heroism that is impossible to put down. This is a loooong book, too, so saying it's impossible to put down means you're not going to get much sleep once you begin reading. So drink some high-test coffee, fluff up your bed pillows, and settle down for the joy of reading one of the best books ever written about the American West."
3,No History Novel,"A fun read in Wild West tradition, well written and edited. But, characters and events are so much bigger-than-life, they detract from the story's credibility. And unless you like snakes and foul weather, don't expect much new knowledge of the history of the time and place."
4,lonesome dove,"Ipurchased Lonesome dove because we received the next book as a gift, and wanted to read this one first. a very good read, and excellent transaction"
5,Unsurpassed,"McMurtry, here, has demonstrated perfectly his ability to get into the minds of all Americans of that time period (yep, including prostitutes and murderers) and has shed a new light on the myth of the American West. ""Lonesome Dove"" is a lyric soap opera about the basic goods and bads of humanity, and the always-present chance of redemption. It's characters are full-blooded and honest, the writing compelling and aware, and the action remarkably portrayed. As for westerns, ""Lonesome Dove"" is the best ever."
5,You must read this book!,"This beloved book is by far the best Pulitzer prize winner of the late 20th century. Do not be put off by the cowboy theme! The characters are lushly drawn, realistic and tragically rendered. While described as the tale of a cattle drive from southern Texas to Montana, it is so much more than that. McMurtry succeeds by fleshing out each character to the utmost, and spicing the dialogue with the ultimate in hang-dog realism and the charming & robust humor of Gus, the central heroic figure of this epic. I loved Gus, because be loved those around him, and my favorite scene is his reunion with his long lost Clara. Every chapter contains adventure, pathos, and redemptions. McMurtry could never again write a better book. I place Lonesome Dove on the top of my best books list. I read it at least once a year!"
4,Good book,"Like this book, interesting and written about the area I grew up in. Enjoy tracing the action on a map."
4,Good Story - Provides insight into living in the old West,"Enjoyed this book. However, I must say it did start off a little slow. This book was so highly recommended I was disappointed at first because not a lot happening until about mid way...The last 300 pages it picked up and Im glad I stayed with it... Read it you will enjoy it..all 945 pages."
5,Lonesome Dove is the BEST!,I would have to say that of all the westerns that i have ever read Lonesome Dove made a place in my heart. I love this book with everything i have in me. I have read this book 4 times now and i love it even more everytime i read it. I am here to say READ THIS BOOK!!!! you will LOVE it!
4,"Overall, a pretty darn good book","I normally am not a fan of the genre, but McMurty's ""Lonesome Dove"" is an excellent period piece and a grand western novel. While it takes quite a while to get going (a couple hundred pages at least), McMurty does a solid job of making his characters seem real and lovable. Outside of the slow start, my other main gripe is that McMurty plays the same cards a few too many times. By the end of the book, you begin to EXPECT characters to die ironic, pointless deaths. But please don't let these minor complaints stop you from reading this fun and memorable epic."
5,My favorite book of all time!,What more can say that hasn't already been said? This was one book I didn't want to see end and am a little jealous when someone gets to read it for the first time. When I got to the last 1/4 of the book I made myself only read 20 pages a day to make it last longer!
5,Best Book I've Ever Read - By Far,"This is an outstanding novel about the American west. I loved ever minute i read of this book. Larry McMurtry goes into great detail about the cattle drive from South Texas all the way up to far North Montana. There is action, adventure, drama, and even some romance. He makes the characters so great. You will just love the way everyone has thier own personallity. I read the whole book in only a few days, I just couldn't put it down. I was hooked after the first few chapters. I can't think of anything wrong with it, thats why I gave it five stars. This is a very superb novel and I would recommend it for anyone."
5,Get ready for a BIG surprise!!,"This film takes you by the hand, and leads you in the wrong direction. I was floored by the ending!"
2,they sort of work,they arrived on time but dont quite melt as advertised required much stiring and left something of a sludge at the bottom of the cup
1,not enough amaretto flavor,"misleading ads - ju,st a nice chocolate candy, not a creamer, doesn't do any more than a piece of chocolate."
3,"Interesting actors, forced to mimic themselves","Thought this was funny at the time, but now: Plot ""twists"" straight out of wrestling...was Captain Lou Albano the screenwriter? New York locale scenes always overcast; looks like it was made in the dismal 70's instead of mid-80's. Joe Piscopo is a very likeable guy, but he should stick to sketch comedy."
5,This movie is excellent excellent!!,This is a great movie if you like the life. They teach you how to outsmart the mob and come out on top. Harry & Moe want to be somebody but when they make a mistake it could cost them their lives. They take off to Atlantic City and hide out from the mob bosses and from theirselves only to find the true meaning of friendship and loyalty. Thank you Mr. Accavano!!
2,good service,I received good service .... not the movie I thought it was but I'm not the type to return anything. My fault.
4,know what you want,"pro:two ways to opennice blade size, shape, sharpnessnice looking knifenice qualitycons:can't move the clipback lock which pretty much negates the fast 1-handed opening with slow 2-handed closingthick for its sizeI'm going to return it because I don't like the lock back although its pretty robust which leads to my seconds reason, it's a tiny bit thick. these are what I look for in an edc so if your preference is different then you might love this knife. but it's still a bit thick, maybe I'm just too used to thin frame locks"
3,TWITCH II,"The knife was smaller than I thought it would be. It's ability to hold an edge is at best adverage. Makes a good pocket knlfe,Because of it's small size and it lack of bulk.It's not a good skinning knife because it gets dull to fast."
1,"""A dull thing with style""","The mechanisms of this knife are functional. It feels appropriate in my hand, if maybe an inch too short. Now that I've said something positive...This is literally the dullest knife I have ever used in my life. I would have no qualms giving this thing to a toddler to play with. I tried it repeatedly on my arm with what would appear as an intent to sever it. The butter knives in my kitchen are sharper than this. The simple solution to this problem would be sharpening the blade, but I don't think it's worth ruining the chance to return it. I am assuming from the positive reviews here that I received a defective product, but I am unlikely to replace it due to the poor quality control."
1,dull blade,I boughr this knife about a year ago and the factory edge was great but it dulls very fast and is hard to sharpen and loses its edge very quickly. I would not buy annother one.
4,Solid EDC,"This is everything I love in a knife: non-plastic handle, polished blade, lockback design, and flipper with assisted opening. It's hard to find all these things, oh yeah AND made in USA! Loving this knife so far.On the other hand there are a few things that take away a star for me. Those being: blade lockup isn't the most solid (a little side-to-side movement but not much, more movement while blade is closed), the flipper's angle is a little steep which makes it a chore sometimes, the size is probably a little smaller than you'd think. Oh and if you like using thumb studs to open (I don't), I wouldn't get this knife, the thumb studs are very difficult to use to open this, stick with the flipper. Those things aside it's a very solid knife, great size for EDC and solid feel yet light."
4,Great Everyday Knife,"This is a great everyday pocket knife. Pocket clip is strong, so the knife stays put. I don't worry at all about the knife falling out of my pocket. WARNING - The kick makes opening addictive. The lock works good, although I worry : how many uses until it gets worn out? It comes razor sharp, and has held it's edge pretty well. The ambidexterous thumb studs are useless. Too close to the pivot, and my thumb gets pinched. Good thing the kick opening is awesome.This one is just the right size. Smaller would have been too small, and larger would not be legal where I work (it's < 3 inches).Very glad I bought it."
3,Twitch II,A high quality item but awkward for me to hold and use (perhaps due to its size). The controls are very stiff (but may get better with more usage).
2,Does not keep and edge,"This knife is fun to flip but does not keep and edge, I have already switched back to my Benchmade EDC."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with the quality of the movie. I bought it as a gift for an elderly friend, and when we watched it, the DVD kept stopping."
5,Driving Miss Daisy,Love this movie ALL TIME FAVORITE!!!!!Bought the DVD and downloaded to my Kindle Fire.Great acters and a wonderful rainy day movie.
4,miss daisy,movie got here on time. very good quality for a used dvd. i would recommend this to anyone. enjoy it
3,"Excellent movie, poor presentation","great movie, very watchable... too bad it's not available in widescreen like it was on laserdisc. poor picture quality, poor sound quality -- this one's for the diehard ""Miss Daisy"" fan."
4,Great acting but no masterpiece.,This is a really good film about a strange relationship between two very different persons. The acting is what makes this film so good. Morgan Freeman is one of the best actors around and this is one of his best performances. Jessica Tandy one an oscar deservedly for her role in the film. The film is however no masterpiece and shouldn't have one the best picture award. In my opinion it stole it from Oliver Stone's masterpiece. Alltogether a worthy movie in every DVD collection.
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Painfully earnest and broad, Driving Miss Daisy charmed Oscar voters enough to make them forget that the movie generates almost no interesting character interaction or tension, but instead feels like a sappy made-for-TV movie with large chunks removed."
3,Hit and miss,"How right magnoliavillage is when he/she asserts ""Freeman's character is instantly likeable and Tandy's character is, well... she's not likeable"". I think that pretty much sums it up for me."
2,One long product placement,"It has always amazed me that this movie won awards. Not only is it the typical Hollywood treacle approach to human relations, but it is truly offensive in its commercialism. Practically every scene outside the house is shot against a prominent billboard for some product or other, and every time we hear the radio, it's a commercial. In one scene, Dan Ackroyd lights up a cigarette and gratuitously peers out his office window at a billboard advertising cigarettes. One of the characters dies in a slow-motion scene -- another cheap Hollywood trick designed to focus attention on the radio commercial played in real time. About the only product in this movie that is not obviously being plugged is Miss Daisy's Hudson!"
4,Great Entertainment,"One of the most lovely movies of our time. My heart was touched by the true-to-life examples of prejudice, sacrifice, love, and perseverance displayed in the characters. A great family movie!"
2,Not impressed with the DVD version,"I was very disappointed with the DVD version of this movie! Not only was it the full-screen format, but the picture was just not digital quality. I don't know what WB was thinking!"
5,Driving Miss Daisy,"The relationship between a 70-year-old Southern woman and her black chauffeur, spanning 20 years. Driving Miss Daisy is a movie that will make you smile, and than cry. Driving Miss Daisy is one of the few good movies of its kind, being elavated to near greatness by a good screenplay, and wonderful acting."
5,My 10 yr daughter is Miss. Daisy!,"My husband and myself went to the theater to see this movie when it first came out-which was before we had kids! It came to mind again once our 10 yr old daughter starting giving reminders from the BACKSEAT, such as ""You are driving over the speed limit!, Don't forget to put your blinker on, SEATBELTS on everyone...etc..She has really put it all in prospective for us! So we started calling her Miss. Daisy-had to get the movie for her-She thought it was so FUNNY!"
2,why no widescreen?,"I just have to say that such a beautiful film deserves better treatment on DVD. It simply does not make sense to put out this DVD title in only full-screen format. If WB comes to its senses and creates a better quality widescreen Miss Daisy, I would not hesitate to buy it and give a five-star review. Until then, save your money and buy the VHS version."
5,Driving Miss Daisy,"Great movie. We saw this when it was at the movies, bought the VHS and wanted to update our library with the DVD. We have probably watched this movie 20 times. Great entertainment. A great performance by Morgan Freeman."
2,Waste Of Time,"As I watched the credits roll at the end of this movie, I sat there stunned! Wondering to myself when the movie was going to actually Start, Much less end? THIS MOVIE WON AN OSCAR? WHAT A JOKE! I Really like Morgan Freeman, his mere presence in the movie is the only reason I gave it 2 stars! This one can put you to sleep if your not carefull."
3,Repulsive harnaguing,"Jessica Tandy harangues like an orangoutang and if you ever wanted to feel the spirit of Lucifer inside you, then watch this movie. If your body flow is not quite the eternal throbbing of love, learn what Miss Daisy did, and get nasty!"
1,racist and typical hollywood,personally morgan freeman is a genius of an actor and jessica taddy is good.but this film is so typical of hollywood.black man has drive around this elder white woman and be always careful.this isn't progress this is streotype hollywood style.
4,Nice family drama,"A calm and subtle review of race relations over about 40 years. Never in your face, it still makes you think about the changes in our country and the work that remains to be done."
5,Driving Miss Daisy,"Daisy Werthan crashes her car in the driveway, and her son Boolie forbids her from driving. Daisy's an independent lady, and is determined to get out and about, taking trolley cars and the like instead. Boolie would prefer it if she used the chaffeur he hired, Hoke Colburn. He's a friendly guy, but Daisy's stubborn about the idea, and doesn't like the idea of her personal space being invaded so frequently. Still, she eventually lets Hoke driver her places, and as the years go on, they become good friends.""Driving Miss Daisy"" is an interesting little drama, starring Morgan Freeman, Jessica Tandy and Dan Aykroyd. Though its set mostly in and around the car, dialogue does most of the driving, and it's interesting to listen to.Worth a look for fans of drama, I think."
4,We love Marilyn!!!!,"I just have to say that Marilyn Monroe's voice seems to just call out to the listener.......her soft quiet and sexy whispering made men adore her and women admire her, what an album!"
3,Julian close ups,"Wow, this is a good one. Not so much for plot, but because I'm more of an ""actor person"". There are some fantastic close ups of Julian's face and hands in this. Brigitte Nielson is quite a beautiful tall woman too (even if her acting leaves something to be desired). Nice people to look at. Nice film work."
5,very good,"It was really good. There was a ton of violence and some sex. What more do you want. The plot was laid out exelently and it all was very real. It wouldn't be for an 8 year old, but any older would be ok (unless the parents are overprotective). This book I think is better than the original. I read it all in one day because I couldn't put it down!"
3,Good not great.,"The movie is a little better than the books. The problem is that these young men and women just had their home invaded and they labor over taking up arms and fighting them. They are so P.C. that they worry whether or not they should shoot them, and whether or not it was their countries fault for the invasion. (The idea being that they didn't treat their neighbors good enough and had it too good themselves.) The action however, is good and the interaction between characters is rewarding. So put the foolish P.C. stuff aside and it is enjoyable."
1,No more Marsden on Kindle for me.,"This is an excellent book for young adults, certainly the equal of the first volume in Marsden's series.Do not, however, think that the Kindle edition is the same as either the hardback or paperback edition. The quality control on the Kindle edition is appalling, there are so many spelling errors it is hard to believe it had even the most cursory of edits. If this is the quality that Amazon is prepared to sell on the Kindle then ebooks will never become popular.Buy the paperback, but not the Kindle edition."
1,Part Way through the season and it was removed from Prime,I started watching this thankful it was on Prime. Now I can't finishing watching the season without paying per episode or the next season for that matter.
1,check it out at the library first!,"I'm not sure what I was expecting but this book reads like a compilation of old Mother Earth News articles. I don't know where the author lives but the limited suggestions for businesses have been done to death around most parts so that leaves you with his ""wisdom"" such as; don't throw money around or keep a low profile to the government or to neighbors if you are operating a business out of your home...whoa...just slightly obvious. I was hoping for new thinking on finding niches in order to make a living, not suggestions that are marginal at best, such as collecting pine cones or working on cars in my backyard and oh yeah, the classic advice; don't blow your cover by buying a Mercedes with cash! Sheesh! Save your money."
4,Good advice but a little short,"While I agree that people should learn a secondary trade to have something to fall back on if the economy goes down the tubes, I do not like to place honest hard working people in the same category as ""underground"" merchants. This book is excellent for those of us who mindlessly followed the law for years and are fed up with unions, work permits and filing taxes. However, the REAL underground economy is much darker than simple tax evasion or ""collecting syrup from maple trees"" (a good idea nonetheless). What would have greatly enhanced this book would be sections on how to obtain things like apartments, used vehicles, and guns through shady channels. An especially good section would have been ""How to contact and conduct business with smugglers and assorted ""dealers."" Otherwise, another good read from Uncle Ragnar."
3,"Generic, outdated information for the unimaginative","I was expecting more advice on how to find opportunities than provided. This book really just provides the basics to people who are not already working in blue collar jobs where under the table payments are commonplace. The ideas for money making are pretty limited and really don't apply much to city dwellers. Cutting wood, fixing cars, etc is great provided you have the skills and means to do these things. I'd like to see an update version that gives more ideas that apply to today's economy and demand for jobs."
5,Very Good Book,"Love Ragnar Bensons books, i own almost every one. Few very good ideas in there about dropping out of the system. Me i dont have alot of ""skills"" when it comes to being a handyman. If anything this book will help you understand whats going on."
4,easy-to-remember words of wisdom with daily applicabilies,"The essence of experiences of journeys of men of virtue throughout centuries, This book is like a shining light in words on paper. Human nature, capacity, capability and quest for meaning is universal and unchanging. As we find through the book that age old questions of identity of humanity is answered in understandable, yet simple language. A good book for a thirsty soul."
4,given the alternatives...,"I'm not a big fan of the taste. I've tried mixing it with water (as instructed) and with soy milk. It just doesn't taste very good to me, but not bad. For an easy vegan meal replacement, it does the trick, and the price is good. I'll try the vanilla next, as that might mix well with some fruit in the blender."
1,New and Improved Formula Much Better!!!!!!!!,"I have been using this brand for about two months, but I was using the one with the new and improved formula. I decided to give this a try since it was cheap and I thought the Bavarian Chocolate would taste more chocolate-tier than the regular chocolate. I was wrong this one doesn't dissolve as well and it doesn't taste like chocolate, it's more of a bitter taste. Also it doesn't keep me full 4-5 hours like the other one does.I will be going back to the one that is sold in the bag since it taste amazing and it's $20 at Sams Club!!! The new and improved formula is the way to go!!!!"
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these Scotts Ortho Home Defense Max ant Baits","I steamed my living room carpet and later on that day, I saw lots of tiny dead ants on top of the carpet. YuKKKK! I was going to call a pest service, but decided to try these first. They worked perfectly and no more ants! I also love the fact that they are safe and much nicer than other types. The ants go in and are trapped inside and one doesn't have to see dead ants every where. You can also also use them outside."
3,Skips on small computer,"Fun story/activity for 2 1/2 year old, but the disc skips. Might be the computer, a fairly small lap top."
3,Two catchy tracks,Genie in a Bottle has aged pretty good.catchy cut.come on over baby has a decent Hook&Groove. a nice light vibe that fits Christina's vocals.I would hope in the future that she gets the kind of material that fully highlights Her vocal Range.
4,an excellent vegetable bowl,"An excellent bowl from a renouned maker. Also has matching dinner sets to go with. The design is a great play of yellow and green and the size and shape suitable for many uses. A tough piece which is oven, dishwasher, freezer proof, and has a 3 year warrenty too. In short a lovely piece, with or without the dinnerset."
5,Hmm..,"I think this is a great algebra 1 textbook. It covers alot of needs and has odd-numbered problem answers in the back of the textbook.It has examples, etc."
4,Algebra book,The Algebra book we ordered arrived in good shape and in good time. It is a great help to have an extra copy at home.
3,"Danaher-Eyes That See, Ears That Hear",Danaher's approach is strictly academic. It is not what I had expected.
2,Translation wasn't enjoyable,"I bought this for a 20th C. philosophy in the wake of Nietzche class and found it an awkward read. Much declamation and lots of ""THEE"" and ""THOU""'s. I found the Hollingdale 1961 so much more readable and easy to understand. I plan to reread the work in the Hollingdale translation since I don't think this translation made the work very enjoyable."
4,German Literature at it's Best,"I don't like Nietzsche. His theories are inhumane, and his insights psychotic. But anyone who reads the man's work knows that even after translation (by the prestigious RJ Hollingdale), Nietzsche's ability to write beautiful prose is an indisputable fact. One must often wonder where his ideas would be today if he had been a mediocre story teller?Thus Spoke Zarathustra is, in my humble opinion, the place where anyone who wants to read Nietzsche should start. The ideas are deliniated clearly and the fashion in which they are strew is fully comprehendable. Or, if you prefer, try Beyond Good and Evil.RSM"
2,PRATTLE OF A LUNATIC,"A prattle of an impatient and shortsighted man who lost faith in God, love for humanity and hope for life, and as a result experienced constant depression and eventually ended up in a nuthouse. This is the faith of all atheists.No doubt ALL of Nietzsche's ideas are sheer lunacies, but I would still recommend reading them -- this book would serve as a stark warning against atheism."
1,Not a great add-on,I am not thrilled with this add-on.The cab-views are ok - the landscape looks more like a lunar-landscape - Didn't know that everything in that area is grey in grey.Unless you want to stay around the year 2000 with the era of the add on I recommend German Railroads 2 instead.
1,Buy this un-returnable item and beware,"This product is in now way as described. The filling is compressed to the point where you sink immediately to the ground. It does not feel like sleeping on a cloud at all. Bits of trash poke as well. Additionally, once you open it- it is impossible to replace in the box for shipment back to amazon for a refund. I highly doubt it is safe for children as my cat sunk right down and was caught in all the loose fabric. This is not a chair in any sense."
3,less than perfect,The motion detection is not very accurate. The light sensor works as expected. I would not recommend this product.
5,Birthday present,"I bought this as a birthday present for my boyfriend. I haven't yet had the opportunity to open and listen to the CD's but this is just what my boyfriend wanted! It arrived on time, and was exactly as described."
5,Beyond Devotion,"Amazing 12-cd set.Great for any starter interested in the Grateful Dead or any DeadHead lookin to expand to their collection without having to pay $13.00 an album at Best Buy. Great History Lessons on the start up until the finish with their Warner Bros. Days. Every Album is a must have and to get over 154 songs for less than a dollar each, you cant go wrong with this box set. The Live Albums are the best and I couldnt purchase The Golden Road without Beyond Description Box set. totally kicks butt- which by the way i waited about a year and a half to purchase that box set. Its nice to have all there studio albums & start out as a freshie when it comes to the history of great american music.Great reading material, discography,music& old school pics of the dead in their early days. Couldnt ask for a better box set really."
5,There best years where 1965 -69 this is a great box set !!!,I am a big fan of Psychedelic Music of the late 60s. So that being said you know where I am coming from. I am also not a country / folk fan. I'm a Rock & Roll Fan. So that being said I love the Dead from 1965 to 1969 and after that its hit and or miss.I like some of there later songs and some of there live jams.This is an Awesome !!! CD if you are into 60s Psych music.I consider this the Deads best Album right with Aoxomoxoa then Anthem of the Sun then Live Dead in that order there best four Albums.My reaction to Workingman's Dead and American Beauty (Both great Albums if you like that type of music) is this a Rock band? Where are the electric Guitars?Sorry I love the Deads early Rock Music.
2,Depends...,"If you already have most of these releases on CD, this collection will not add much to your collection that is new. The bonus tracks are mostly alternate studio versions of the same songs that are already on the CD, and do not add much else. I don't find myself greatly appreciating the remastered sound and essays and pictures are not why I buy Grateful Dead CDs. What we need is more fantastic music from concerts, CDs like Phil Zone, or Ladies and Gentlemen..."
5,"Very satisfied with the purchase, great grip, smooth peel","Very satisfied with the purchase, great grip, smooth peel.And appearance is extremely sexy."
5,Great! Great! Great!,"Two of the basic kitchen specialty items included in one package deal! Easy grip handles, stylish and quality design will assure that these items will be around in my array of often used gadgets for a long time to come!"
5,very nice,"I bought one each in every shape and color that was left, and very glad I did. The bakers come in plain brown boxes, but I was taken by their beauty when I take them out. The blue color I received is deeper blue, like navy blue, than what is shown in picture, and the red is deeper red, but I still like them very much.These are individual bakers, for one person. At first, I thought I would use them as individual appetizer/soup, and/or desert. I have in mind picture of a 2-cup measuring cup when I order them, but for some reason these bakers seem bigger(deeper) than I thought. The round one measures 5.5"" across with out the handles, and 3"" deep, the oval one measures 6.5"" X 5"" without the handles, and 3"" deep, and they come with lids. I think they are more appropriate for single serving of the main dishes, like beef-stew, dinner soup, or pasta.They also would make great gifts for single persons. Going to order more of the bigger size on what they have left."
3,"Good product, but missing two important features","This product has many nice features, and the sound quality is better than FM radio and MP3s (but not quite as good as CD). However, this product does not contain two features that are important to me.Feature One: Channel Surfing. While watching TV, I like to channel surf by pressing the Next Channel button on the TV's remote control. With one button press, I can jump to the next channel (example: I'm at channel 40, pressing the button sends me to channel 41). The Polk tuner does not have a Next Channel button, instead, you have to press three buttons to move to the next channel. The Polk tuner has some sophisticated features for moving through channels, but lacks basic Channel Surfing.Feature Two: Headphone Jack. I want to listen to this Tuner with headphones in my bedroom, but I had to buy a Receiver just so that I could use the Receiver's headphone jack."
3,XRt12,Good over all product. The gray buttons on the reciever stick sometimes and I was dissapointed with the remote control. The remote is much bigger than it needs to be and is just a plain rectangle that feels akward in your hand. Sound is good though and the menues are easy to use. I also like the bright display which is big enough to read without to much effort. Keep in mind that if you want xm in your car also you might be better off with a portable unit and a home docking system or you will have to pay for a second radio which isnt cheap.
3,"Decent, integratable with your HT/HA PC system.","Product is decent, most importantly it is integratable with your HT/HA system via RS232. I can control it via my package (CQC) that also controls CDs, DVDs, TV, HVAC, irrigation, lighting, & security. The Polk XRt12 makes the perfect partner for myhometheaterpc."
5,Tattered Tapestry,Very well written and an important piece of work for those suffering from Bipolar disorder and for their caregivers.
5,buen perfume,"buen perfume, llego a tiempo muy bueno. el olor es excelente100% recomendado para todos en la comunidad..good night"
5,Es un buen material,"Me agrado lo que pude escuchar del disco parece que es una buena opción musical, es un disco con una melancolia tanto en la musica como en lo que puede apreciarse en la letra espero ecuchar mas material de la banda posteriormente.Llega a México el disco? espero que si"
1,SOUL SPECTACULAR (BOX SET),EXCELLENT ..EVERYTHING THAT TAKES YOU ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE GOOD OLD DAYS AND REAL LOVE..
4,Good Chocolate,I love Aero bars. The problem is that they are difficult to find locally. I personally like to put them in the freezer prior to eating them. The product arrived in good condition.
1,OLD & CRUMBLED,"The bars I received were crumbled on one end & light tan in color, which indicates OLD chocolate. That end of the bar tasted awful. I have seen that a million times & I recognize what it means. The other end of the bars had melted & reset, but still tasted OK & were the correct color for fresh chocolate. A second set was sent to me at no charge, however, the same was true of those. Also appeared that the company was not too happy with my complaint, as the second set arrived in a small, smashed box with a tiny piece of bubble wrap floating around loose in the box & had not been secured to the bars with tape to protect them."
5,Audio adaptor,Item was exactly as expected and as described. Works perfectly. Price was reasonable. Shipping was better than anticipated. Efficient design tak4es a minimum space to use.
1,Do not use with Thrive pad,Male prong is not long enough to work with a Toshiba Thrive pad. Find another product if you need for this device.
4,Handy and Quality,This item was very useful for hooking up sound system to tv without audio out jacks. Also use another to connect my computer to the system. Very useful little tools and they are quality products. The price is amazing on them. Would recommend to anyone who is looking to buy.
4,Both outputs colored RED,"This adapter works perfectly fine. However, if you care about which RCA output is RIGHT (typically RED) and which is LEFT (typically WHITE), you will have to figure out which of the two RED outputs it is on the adapter you will get.The one I received did NOT look like the picture with both colors, but, as I said above, came with both of them being RED. Of course you can figure it out with some trial and error or use a multimeter to figure it out, but kind of a pain.Otherwise, it did what I needed it to do."
3,it works,"what else to expect when you pay so less for an item, you get what you pay for. cheap product as the price says, but it works"
3,Product may vary.,"Be care that the adapter you see in the picture may not be what you get. The one I received is black with golden shields and yellow sockets not red and white. Not that that matters, outside of the fact that the shield pieces are rusty on the one I received. It looks extremely cheap, but then again I only payed a dollar for it. It gets the job done just the same as I need it to. Compared to the eight or nine dollars I probably would have had to pay at Radio shack. Overall it does as it is supposed to, but looks cheap and I would have payed another two dollars to have one I felt was of better quality."
2,Does not work as it should,"I was going to use this to connect it to my xbox 360, so i could hear the sound through my headphones. Once connected, sound only came out through 1 headphone speaker. I don't know why there is that many good reviews for it."
1,this is not that great,let me start of saying that it is not 3.5mm the second thing is the quality it is absulutly horrible I cant describe how horrible this product is
4,It works,I used it to hook up my ps3 to my computer speakers and it works as needed. No problems with it here.
4,It does the job,See this tiny little thing?You know what it does?It takes audio over the red and white and makes them plug into things like your computer.It does this properly.There has been no sound distortion or muffled sounds or any problems after I switched to this.
3,Cables To Go - 40645 - 3.5mm Stereo Male To 2X RCA Female Adapter,"I think the product will work just fine. The one thing that did surprise me was that the photo in the add showed a RED and WHITE female connectors (indicating which was left and which was right). The product I received was NOT RED and WHITE but both are YELLOW!!!When I order a product, I do so based on the information provided me. When the product I receive does NOT have the appearance of the photo I saw when I ordered, it leaves me with mixed feelings about this source of products and unsure whether or not I would order from this source in the future."
4,Where's The Color??,"This product works great!!! However, sometimes it's the smallest things that customers (especially a techy one) pay attention to! The RED and WHITE audio colors were NOT there! It was a dull yellow color on both RCA female ends. Not a big deal...but still. Buy if you don't mind this issue. ( Keep in mind that speakers give you sound location. Example: If you play a video game and someone comes up to you from your right side, you should hear footsteps or something on the RIGHT SPEAKER, which is were the color code comes into play) Thanks to someone who recently told me that this review should have the marketplace seller who sold this item, I can now say that the seller was Amamax. There is a link in the comments below."
4,Ps3,Got it to hear sound from computer speakers works great just what I was looking for so if you thinking about it get it because it better to play on a moniter
3,I think I'm not doing it right...,"This is a part, but not necessarily the problem-causing part, of a problematic sound system. That is, if you can even call it a sound system when it's an old GameCube connected by this piece into an old computer's microphone jack, with sound then being put out from the computer through two audio cables with a coupler between them to the actual speakers. To me, that sounds like an awful setup, and it does in fact produce awful sound."
5,Audio Adapter at Amazon,Excellent adapter! Well worth the price! The price was very economical and adapted to my needs extremely well. Highly recommend this adapter!
2,Half-broken.,"When I received it, it was half broken, and I managed to glue it back together, this was probably due to bad packaging combined with improper care by postal workers. It took a few months but eventually it stopped working, (After a few more repairs along the way.) I would recommend just buying one from a local store to prevent damage."
3,"A little cheap, but who cares?","Works for my purpose, and is hidden so even though its sore on the eyes, in my application, it doesnt matter."
5,Forget about cables,"If you need to convert from an 2-RCA audio to a 3.5 mm plug, forget about using special Y cables to do the job. I've tried several with no success. If you find one that works, it will be broken shortly. I guess it must be difficult designing a durable cable solution for this conversion. Instead, use just a normal 2-RCA male to 2-RCA male, plus this adapter. This is a sound design that works fine, will last for a long time, and it's very cheap."
4,"Less than $2, can't complain","This piece has worked well for my gaming headphones. I do not have proper audio output on my tv for my headphones, so I had to purchase this adapter. For less that $2, I figured I would take a chance. It has worked great and I have noticed no lost sound quality compared to my last tv in which I was able to hook the headphones to directly. The only problem with the adapter is that it is made from the cheapest material possible. It hasn't broken or quit working, it just looks and feels cheap, but again, for less than $2, I can't complain too much."
1,Item does not match the photo,A waste of money. It does not look like the photo at all. The two RCA female connectors are all in yellow but not red and white.
5,Works Great.,"One can never have enough of these things. It's always good to have a few lying around, you never know when you'll need one."
4,good for the price,"very cheap. the left and right inputs were a little bit off center, but completely workable. Plastic is very flimsy/cheap."
5,"Great converter, Love it","Excellent, compact, just great, works fine, love it, nice, bought two, low cost, just what I needed, bought two, everyone should get two"
4,It works.,"I received the adapter in a reasonable amount of time, it was packaged appropriately, just as described/shown in the pictures here... and best of all, it does it is supposed to. Good to go!"
4,Just what we needed :),We finally able to play our portable DVD player in our car when we travel using our car speakers as surrounds.:D
4,easy conversion to stereo hookupfor ipod,"easily converts rca cables to 3.5 for hookup to your older stereo system for all ipod and other mp3 players, works great, sounds great...."
4,OK,"This is a report on your RCA plugs, They work as presented. I was surprised that they came so well from a great distance."
5,Works as advertised,"Currently using it to route the sound from my PS3 to my Klipsch Computer Speakers - sounds amazing!Great quality product, fast shipping, perfect!"
4,Great Item,The item i received was great. shipped extremely fast and was at my door step in no time. was happy with product over all.
1,"works well, good construction","Product was exactly as described and worked perfectly for connecting the RCA out of my xbox 360 to a set of computer speakers. Very high quality construction for the price.**UPDATE: This product BROKE after being used about 4 times. I was very careful with it, and somehow it still broke. I opened it up and found that the internals are ridiculously cheap, it's a wonder it didn't break during shipping. DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,wrong order :(,after research the product I was sent 40650 rca maleto dual in stead of 40645 3.5mm. This is the first time this has happen to me and it the last.
1,priced is right-does not work,"My head phone connection for my TV are female RCA plugs and the the cord is male RCA to male 3.5mm. Some TV's only have a female 3.5mm and a male 3.5 to female RCA adapter is required to use with the head phone cord. The cord works fine with my TV . The adapter does not work on TV's with only a female 3.5mm out. Using a male to male 3.5mm cord on those TV's works. Conclusion adapter does not work.The specs does not state it is an ""in or out"" just looking at I assumed it would work as an out ."
2,Not sure it fits properly,"I bought these to feed an audio signal into the microphone jack of a MacPro. There were no problems on the RCA inputs, but the male end seemed to be slightly small -- it needed repeated ""jiggling"" to make the connection. Since there are no problems with the female jack on the same unit (when we use earphones) I think that the adapter may be slightly smaller than it should be. I can also say that it doesn't fit snugly on either of the female connections on the Mac, which also suggests that the male end is slightly smaller than it should be."
1,Do not purchase this adapter,male end of adapter is too small and does not fit 3.5 mm socket. Right channel cuts out intermittently depending on how the plug is positioned in the socket. Spend a little more money and get an adapter that works.
5,Audio!,If you're in need of good simple quick audio. This is the user to get it from. The only splitter I saw for cheap with great value. WORKS GREAT!
2,"Sold as a new item, but obviously wasn't new","I ordered this item as a Christmas gift. It was advertised as a new item. It arrived stuffed in an unpadded envelope, with no box and no instructions. The mane and the tail on the animal were matted and tangled and the toy was obviously not new. I would think twice before ordering from this vendor."
3,I bought this horse.,"I bought this horse for my nephew. He really wanted it but I couldn't find it in any stores around me. Amazon had it, of course, so I bought it. It's a nice looking horse."
3,The toy itself is mainly a stuffed animal with a code,"I'm not too familiar with these so I have to only tell what I know. This was a gift to a friend's daughter who explained to me how they work. You get the animal, it is a cute stuffed animal, they enter this code in the computer and like every other stuffed animal it ends up on the bed or shelf and then they play and learn a lot of things on this ""Webkinz"" site that is educational."
5,CLYDE,"I LOVE CLYDESDALE HORSES AND PURCHASED THIS ITEM FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER FOR EASTER TO ADD TO HER WEBKINZ COLLECTION.THE PURCHASING EXPERIENCE WAS EXCELLENT, SHIPPING AND DELIVERY PROMPT."
4,Gift for niece,Personally I wish they had these things when I was younger. I LOVE horses and I thought that this would be an awesome gift for my niece. (she seemed to love it!) Not only because its a horse but because you're able to get online and do different things with it. I can't really say much about the online experience as I've never done it but I'm sure its pretty cool.The only thing I have to say that doesn't really have anything to do with this toy is the fact that Amazon jacks up their prices A LOT. I paid $14.99 or so for this guy and its now showing up as $9 for this other company. Not to mention the fact that if your a Costco member you can get two of these guys for about $14 or so!
4,Arguably the hardest blowing band he ever had,"I saw this band at the Newport Jazz Festival, Carnegie Hall when they passed thru in '74. Harry James was also on the bill. At the end of the set, Buddy said that he had played with the best, and this was the greatest band he ever had. It had the intensity of a rock concert.Released on groove merchant, it is contemporary, most of the music holds up today as blazing jazz-rock fusion.And, of course, it contains ""Time Check"", which will sound brand new 500 years from now.The trumpet entrance on ""Backwoods Sideman"" will knock you out of your seat.The legendary bassist, Tony Levin (King Crimson and Paul Simon) sat in on this session!!After this record, Buddy broke up the band to start his own nightclub, ""Buddy's Place"" with a sextet. So it was Pat LaBarbera's swan song, although he joined another great drummer, Elvin Jones.The band definitely went out with a roar!! (although less than two years later, BR was back with the full big band)."
1,Not very good,I was looking for some old Buddy Rich and thought I was ordering something that would be good to listen to...it wasn't. Seemed like a album that was an afterthought. Not worth the money.
2,Screech (ouch!) and Roar of '74,"Having owned the original Roar of '74 vinyl, the current CD version retains Buddy's fast pace backup drumming, but the CD is no improvement on sound quality.The trumpets, cymbals, and anything high frequency sound flat and screechy. There isn't enough of that clear and deep thumping bass sound from this poorly engineered piece of work.The sound of Buddy's drumming is placed too far behind the brass section. No offence to the Killer Force, but it's painful to even crank up the stereo to listen to this CD.Normally, Buddy's drumming is distinct and is pleasing to listen to (i.e. Buddy's Live from Ronny Scott's albums are very good engineered recordings).Buddy's infrequent drum solos are extremely short; approximately less than 10 seconds is his longest solo."
3,not the best effort,The leather is nice ... and the places to hold expansion cards is nice ... but ...What is not nice is the size of this unit ... it protects tha palm ok ... but in doing so makes the case bulky ... it takes a rather slim i705 and makes it big and bulky ... there had to be something better in the design minds out there ... something leather that is half the weight and size ... and something you dont have to take the cover off every time you put it in its cradle ...
4,a pretty good game,i enjoy playing this game it is not as good as the baseball game but alot better then the football game. the sim is the best part of the game the coaching part isnt that good. the trading is hard but that makes it even better and also ur team might get bought by another owner then u have to relocate ur team. playing with a salary cap is tough to work around but all in all it is a good game and i enjoy playing it alot. so i recommend to buy it.
1,Slow and boring,"This is not the best game ever made. NBA Live 2001 has a better sim than this game does. First, it takes forever to make it through a season. Second, even if you win the championship, you don't care, because nothing exciting happens. Trades are almost impossible, plus you never quite know how good a player is when you trade for him. There are none of the real NBA players in it, or team names (even though you can edit those). There are not even any player faces, made up or otherwise. Basically, save your cash. NBA Live 2003 is soon to be out, and I'm sure their sim will be a hundred times better."
4,It does what I need,"I am a writer who works at home and I needed a good ""word"" program to prepare manuscripts for the designer. I chose this one because I hoped it would be easy to use and it is. It does everything I need it to do and I am very satisfied with it."
2,"Fine programs, but some really annoying legal items.","First, the programs are fine. Word could run a little faster, and Powerpoint could do a little more than pictures, sound, and text. The real problem is with the licenses. It comes with three different product keys, and I used all three of them, no more than the legal amount. However, since all of the computers with Office share the same network, if one tries to open any Office program while another is running one, it tells you ""Microsoft Office 2004 is already in use and cannot be started. An office program is already being used by (insert name)."" We might as well just have one computer with Office on it. Thanks, Microsoft! I payed you $150 for three programs!"
2,Office 2004,This Office 2004 has been a problem. I will get my software at the Apple store in the future.
4,Microsoft Office for Mac 2004,"Works fine for my purposes, which is to open email attachments. There is a mild delay as it converts the 2004 to the updated version in which any new stuff is written, which might annoy heavy users, but technically the process is smooth.I like having Word on my Mac.Lisa Taylor"
4,MS OFFICE FOR MAC,"The programs (Word, Excel, Entourage) take a bit to get used to...mainly because of the layout. If you are a ""new"" Mac user like I was coming from a Windows based platform....everything takes time to get used to. All of the shortcuts that are on the Windows version of Office are the same on the Mac version. Moreover, once you get used to using it....you'll notice it's laid out so nicely. Graphics are nice and most importantly the projects you create are compatible w/ other Office (Windows) programs.So glad to see that MS took the time to create a ""suite"" of programs that are compatible for Macs."
4,easy to use,"it was very easy installing this program, and I was happy to pay less for the 3 microsoft programs that I needs, rather than pay more and get other things that I don't need. Using microsoft on mac has been much easier than I thought."
1,Dumb people,"I rated this 1 star just for the people are reading the 1 star reviews. What do people in 2009, 2010, and even 2011 expect from software designed in 2004? I had the 2004 software and have sense upgraded and i am here to tell you that if you don't want to have 2004 bugs don't buy 2004 software. People are not so bright sometimes. I suggest you buy the 2008 or newer software."
1,What other choices are so widely used?,"From my point of view, Microsoft's Word and Excel are de facto standards. Without them my work is much more difficult."
2,Basically a waste of money,I thought the previous version looks better and even works better. I noticed only very few minor changes that didn't make this one better for me. But may be it's just me...:)
1,How can I respond?,"Why send me this? The product has not been received! The software was to be shipped to my son at the University of New Orleans. Despite my requests, no one would redirect to our home address.Given the state of the New Orleans, surely you realize that we have not had the opportunity to review this product.If I ever get this software, for which I have already been charged, I will never do business with Amazon again. Period."
1,Do not buy - not even used,"Slow. Unbelievably S L O W. And forget the functionality. If you ever seriously used Excel or Powerpoint on a Windows XP machine, you will be severely disappointed -- the functions just aren't there in the Mac version. And if they do show up, they often simply don't work. This product is a joke perpetrated on Mac users. Don't waste your time."
5,Good value.,"For under $150, this mac office package is a great value for the four programs included."
5,Love it!,Looks phenomenal on my macbook and I really love using the different programs for work as well as university studies. Great product!
4,MS Office 2004 for Mac,Office continues to be a good product from MS. I'm new to Mac's and Office is doing it's job.
3,Microsoft Office 2004 - Macintosh,"I purchased this product on black Friday solely because of the free upgrade to Office 2008. 2004 has fallen behind its Windows counterpart - but the 2008 upgrade promises to not only catch-up, but have features not found on the Windows version."
5,Mac Office 2004 student version,Works as advertised. No features that the average user would miss. Opens Mac & PC files flawlessly on Macbook Pro with OS 10.4. Should also be upgradeable to offfice 2008.
3,Word,"I did have some difficulty installing using the setup assistant, so I had to do a drag and drop installation.I found this product to be what I needed, a good word processor, plus a lot more than I use currently. It will be fun exploring all the options."
3,It's OK but lags far behind Office '07,"Office is the deFacto standard so having it on the Mac is almost a necessity if you use it for school or business. Office 2004 lags far behind the current Windows versions. Hopefully, the newer Mac version will be released soon."
4,"arrived by turtle, but works.",Took a very long to to arrive but it works. came packaged and easy to load. I think it came by camel riding a turtle. lol
5,Another great product from MacBU!,"I love Office for Mac, and I couldn't work without it. I have a MacBook, and it runs quite well on my Mac. I have absolutely no complaints about Office for Mac. I have no issues going back and forth between Windows and Mac Office, so it's great when I need to use a PC to write a document, and continue working on my MacI have also used Apple's iWork, and I much prefer Office:Mac, however, I have been using Office for Mac since Office 98, so I am used to the way Office works."
5,Upgraded from Office X - Looking Forward to Office 2008 Media Edition,"I just did a simple upgrade of Office X to Office 2004. Easy, straightforward, no problems. I like it. But my real reason for buying was the free Microsoft Office 2008 Special Media Edition. My order with the $6.99 shipping fee was sent today. I'm looking forward to Office 2008, but having Office 2004 will make it an easy wait. In any case, preferences are being set and tested. They will transfer automatically to 2008."
4,good product,"Overall its a pretty good program. I always used it on my PC so I just had to get it for the mac. Biggest issue is that I still have not been able to find how to change the document size in Word. Also when going from Mac to PC fonts do not seem to stay. Glad I purchased it though, Powerpoint has beautiful design I honestly don't use the other two programs so cant say much about them."
4,WORD froMAC,"Once you become familiar with it the program is easier to use, especially embedding pics and graphics. Windows could take a few tips from the MAC program. (I know. I use both.)"
3,PC2Macconvert,"I recently gave up on using a PC, to many problems with automatic windows updates crashing my system. I am a small business user. Using MS Office for Mac 2004 found that most everything works pretty well. Have some trouble getting used to the differences and have problems with cut and paste from documents created in Word 2007 to the Mac version. Excell is OK, I use a statistical macro add-in package (QI macros)that works just fine (do SPC, PPAP's FMEA's, CpK's, ANOVA's and Gage R & R's etc for automotive submittals and all have worked). Dissapointed that not all the templates for Word are not in the Mac version. MS arrogance I guess. On a scale of 10 I'd give it a 6."
3,no real problems,"I guess I'm just a creature of habit. I prefer my older version of MS Office. I'm sure I'll get used to it over time. Yet, like my title says, I haven't run into any operational problems."
3,MAC version of MS Works,"Not a bad product. I do not really like the Entourage feature. There really is not a need for it. I have an email account or two already. I have a planner that I live by and you can't do anything with it except track stuff like that.I am also not satisfied by the way there are not the regular office options in the word section--no resume template! i feel that is a must for a student product like this!! I had to create my own, which did end up coming out better than the one on Word for Windows, but still the function should be there!I just think more should have been included. I also feel that this program does not work as well as the Windows verison. More should be done to make the similar!!This verion for MAC is not that great... the only thing good was that I found it for a great price on Amazon!! Kudos to them!!"
2,Not as good as pages,"Unless you NEED excel, I find iWork to be a much better product. Keynote's presentations look far superior, so much so that Keynote was used exclusively in Gore's Inconvenient Truth. Regardless of your politics, I'd like to see Power Point do half as well in such a demanding environment (no pun intended). Pages is excellent once you discover the ""inspector."" The only reason I would get Office is for Excel, which I did. So excel, gets the nod, but as for everything else, try iWork!"
3,crashes on occasion,"On occasion program lock up and have to force quit it, however, data still available after crash."
5,"Excellent Edition for ""light"" word processing needs.","For those who don't need the full MS Office suite, this Student-Teacher version can't be beat. Even with this ""light"" edition you can still produce professional-looking docuements and presentations. It's a great buy!"
2,"Okay, Not Great!","I purchased this because my trial software on my new IMAC had run out. I figured that since I used Microsoft Office for years on the PC, the best bet was this program. While it does do the basic Microsoft Office things, It also runs slow and crashes my nearly un-crashable computer. Also, the conversion between MAC and PC platforms is not very user-friendly, especially when it comes to using Powerpoint. If you only have text, then fine, but any addition of audio or video, you'll have trouble and will most likely have to download some free program to convert your files to PC friendly ones (which then might not play on your MAC).It's not my favorite program and the fact that it runs slow and might crash on me, makes me worry every time I use it. That said, I use it quite often and can't complain about the final product when on my own MAC."
4,Perfect For Recently Converted Windows User,"Let me set the back story...I have been a PC user since 1982. I have used windows since NT 3.51 and always considered myself a Microsoft guy.That changed this year with the release of Vista and the subsequent release of Leopard. I changed over to Mac and didn't look back. That being said I felt I needed some familiarity with my computer. I could have just used my windows version of Office with Parrells, but I figured I bought a Mac I should use mac programs....Fast forward to today. I simply love office on the Mac (and my Mac too). The program performs exactly like I am used to with my windows version (except it doesn't crash)If you are a recent convert I highly recommend getting this product and 2008 once it comes out."
2,"Kludgy, Cumberson & Crashes","Yeah, the title for this review sounds like a law firm. Sadly, there's nothing particularly funny about Office 2004. I bought it primarily for Microsoft Word, and have been very frustrated with the program's tendency to crash almost every time I use it. Additionally, there are so many (ahem) ""features"" that the program has become very difficult to use. Whenever possible, I use Word 5.1, which seemed to hit the sweet spot of usefulness and stability. Word 2004 just isn't stable enough for me to trust major projects to."
5,Microsoft Office for mac is easy to use,"Microsoft office for mac is really easy to use and as a college student, I cannot imagine using anything else."
2,microsoft Office for Apple computers,The instructions are almost useless! One has to find out things by trial and error.
3,It is Microsoft Office,"Office isn't the best design product ever, but if you have to use it you have to use it. Their is not real substitute for OS X."
4,Word for Mac,"This is my second version of Microsoft Word for Mac. My new Apple G-5 wouldn't accept my really old version. I got it loaded just fine and I was off and computing in minutes. It's a product I wouldn't be without no matter what kind of computer I was using, but I am a 20 yr. Apple veteran."
4,microsoft office suite,Awesome package...if only microsoft and apple could begin moving onto the next step of creating a more dynamic market place for there products.
3,Jeep 3-In-1 (more like 1 way only),"We bought this carrier for our 3 month old and she only fits in it one way,facing forward with the top folded over.(She is average size 23"" & 13 lbs)She does enjoy being in it,but I don't know how long she be able to fit.It claims it's goog for up to 30lbs.It is pretty comfortable for us,but the straps need to be tighted often.(Quick tug)"
2,humph!,I had to buy this one because the first one broke and it couldn't be repaired.RENT a paint sprayer and save yourself the trouble.
3,obsolete,Why the heck do I have to write areview? They aren't paying me jackto utilize my literary skills. Ifyou want this thing then just orderit.
4,not bad,"game is great good graphics for the age of the game, runs well on windows 7 32 bit with good hardware have a 2.8 gighz prosseser and an nivida 210 video card and great fun"
1,"Strike ""Biter""","This Sim is a classic example of marketing hype, must have been where all the $$ went for this project, it certainly didn't showup in the software. Save your money and download a few BMP's from a military URL for free. SF should be rated a big zero, but one star was all I had to work with. What a temendous disappontment! Shame on you Strategy First/""Last""BLTexas"
3,Johnstown,"My review of this work seems to have disappeared. Perhaps because it was not all glowing and positive. I have renewed interest in the area because of a recent trip. It was not until I got home from an event that I realized I had bought the book, stored it away Promotional literature about Johnstown ethnic population makes no mention of the Jewish presence. I instinctively knew this was wrong. When I arrived home I dug out the book, and began reading it with new interest. I was delighted that it was entirely about the Jewish experience in Johnstown. What I was basically unhappy about it the lack of readablity. Although this is a scholarly work it is not ""user friendly."" Plain and simple it might as well be written in a foreign language. I wish the author had taken time to see the work as important enough to write it to be understood. It would be wonderful if she would create a second version."
3,Slick but a bit buggy--and not that much fun,"Nicely done and a good bit of variety, but we found it buggy in places (wrong answers, mostly). It's also quite hard for a first-grader: from the second level on up it's got tough multiplication and and three-digit subtraction. More to the point, the six-year-old proclaimed it boring, and I have to agree."
5,this is the movie that made me fall in love with elvira,this is a great movie for elvira fans i want all her outfits unfortentally i can only find the dress love elgunquin too an bob
4,Actually pretty good.,"I decided to watch this movie because I wanted to see what it was like. I wouldn't say I've ever been a fan of Elvira or anything, but I was just a little curious as to what the movie was going to be like. I was glad that it was actually pretty funny! So, for anyone like me, who isn't really familiar with the Elvira character, I'd recommend giving this movie a shot. There's a good deal of sex humor, so if that's not your thing, maybe you'd pass. Of course with a character who constantly has her jugs half popping out, you gotta expect some sexual references/innuendos/etc."
3,Trick or Treat,"Holloweeny. Campy and trashy, but wth, this was fun to watch with a few friends last night on Elvira's favorite night of the year. After a few brews, it was hilarious. The punked out Chihuahua is my favorite. And we have Elvira slinging and swinging the tassels in a burlesque dance at the end of the show. You go, babe, youse the cat's PJs. Err...the bat's PJs."
5,How could anyone not love this movie?,"It seems to me one of the very few movies that my entire family really enjoyed was Mistress of the Dark. It's a little horror, a little camp and a lot of laughs. Even after so many years my friends and family still use lines from the movie and they're still funny! If you're a fan of comedies you should definitely check this movie out, it's a lot of fun!"
4,big tits,this one was funny Alvira is the chick to see shes young and beautiful here i sware on my grave if it wasnt for her black dress or what ever she she wouldnt be as famous as she was 40 so years ago
5,"Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, a horror queen","Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, is a favorite horror host of mine. I used to watch her on late night TV and was happy that she made a film of her own. With the advent of commercial DVD's, it is now possible to own these films for personal use. I have seen the film several times and like to watch it often.The setting of New England, a past center of witchcraft, is perfect in an updated horror film. The pursuit of a Vegas career is a modern twist. As a fan of stippers, Elvira's stage act is a throwback to old burlesque. All in all, I am happy to own a film favorite."
4,"Corny, Campy Comedy!","A fun romp into Elvira's world, complete with her corny humor. You'll love the clever little jokes interwoven with the story, such as the name of the small conservative town Elvira roars into--Fallwell, Massachusetts as a dig against Jerry Falwell. Ignore Matlin's review--this is an enjoyable film, pure entertainment full of humorous cliches probably borrowed from those terrible horror films that Elvira hosts and commentates. This is especially a great film for Halloween."
1,elvira mistress of the dark,the copy i received was a pirated copy and the chapter stops were very primitive and the quality was grainy
2,great campy movie,"if you like campy movies, busty babes, and like to laugh then this movie is for you. How can you go wrong with watching the funny and busty elvira for 90 mins. This is one of those movies where you shut your brain off and just have fun with it, also check out elviras other movie, elviras haunted hills."
4,"campy, spicy and funny","Campy and sexy, pretty funny also. You find yourself staring at her breast half of the time, but once you get past that, it is pretty entertaining. A bit sarcastic. Middle-class value? Out of the window. Elvira is great in this."
4,Elvira - Love her or Hate her she is the 80s,"Anyone familiar with Elvira knows you aren't watching this because you are a bastion of good taste. She was high camp and this movie was the high point of her career. From the one liners to the sight gags this movie is a romp on the wild side. She takes pot shots at other movies popular at the time and takes her audience on a fun ride all the way through. This is the sort of movie you sit down to when you want a good laugh and your horror on the light side. Can't say I've ever heard anyone not enjoy the movie. You have to see the ""baby"" Elvira if nothing else that alone is worth the viewing. Enjoy."
3,Vamp Romp,"Elvira does a nice job of romping through this comedy based on her TV character. She heads out to find out her portion of an inheritance and finds a disgruntled Uncle wants her Aunt's cookbook, not Elvira's assets. He must be a Eunick. While the town finds Elvira to be a grotesque floozy, the kids think she's cool. Elvira abiding by her own methods sets out to get money for the Las Vegas act by selling cookbook, house, dog, and anything eles not nailed down. Naturally along the way she begins to appreciate the value of them and is almost burned at the stake as well. Many funny skits. One of my favorites is her dream about her inheritance being like a TV game show with prizes offered in the same manner. I recommend it, especially to any Elvira fan. Most the humor is geared towards adults, but I found myself amused in a Jim Varney sort of way throughout the movie."
4,"From reading the reviews, ""haven't had any complaints yet""","This movie is hillarious! Elvira is the funniest movie, and her jokes are absolutly the best. She always has the best comebacks to anyone who gives her a hard time. Buy this movie, well from the looks of it, you'll have to wait untill it is back in print"
1,What is wrong with you people?,"I wouldn't watch this movie again if my life depended on it. Cheesy movies are supposed to be funny. I like Elvira's boobs as much as the next guy, but why does this movie need to make a breast joke every 30 seconds? ..."
4,Great Flower Lessons,I felt the book provided good lessons and beautiful graphic design . The artist does certainly draw radiant flowers. My main objection is the variety of colored pencils and watercolor pencils needed to have on hand from various different companies.
3,Book of copying,"The book is full of beautiful and inspirational flower drawings, I admit. I hoped to get some hints about drawing flowers generally, but the author teaches the reader to copy his(her?) drawings step-by-step, including to use the same pencils/colours. Maybe, if I was 10 years old, it would be helpful, but as an adult, I don't want to copy someone's creation. Yet, the book is not disappointment to me - it introduces a new technique of coloured pencils I never met before."
5,Fit for a queen,I have been searching for a flatware chest for some time that was beautiful and economical. This chest exceeds my expectations. I have service for 16 plus 8 additional teaspoonsand 6 serving pieces. I leave it out on display because it is just too pretty to put away. Extremely well made.
1,Wallace Lacquered Flatware Storage Chest,"I purchased this chest as a gift for my grandaughter. I had purchased a flatware set separately. Unfortunately, the knives do not fit in the slots indicated for them. Therefore, it doesn't hold the service for 16 as advertised. I am very unhappy about this and would like to return it."
5,Did the job well,"We got these to raise our cosleeper to the height of our bed. Although I was concerned about their stability after reading other reviews, our cosleeper is secure and stable even with all 4 extensions on each leg, and I'm glad we bought them. (I wouldn't necessarily move it from room to room with them attached, but they work perfectly with the cosleeper attached to our bed.)"
2,Price gouging,Did we need these leg extensions to safely and properly use the Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper with our bed? Yes. Did Amazon.com have the best price for these leg extensions? Yes. Are these worth $17.60? No. Complete price gouge. I would have been more ok with paying $10 (which would still be too much for these small pieces of plastic). I agree with the other reviewer who said that these should be included with the co-sleeper.
2,Don't buy if you have an older model.,I could not use these because my Arm's Reach co-sleeper was an older model and these were not compatible. I called the company and their only solution was to suggest I build a platform.
2,not sturdy,I love that they make the sleeper level with the bed but... anytime we move the sleeper the legs fall off. This also could be dangerous if one of my other kids lean in to get a look at the baby.
3,Perfect height,"The extensions themselves were a must for us, as we have a pretty tall bed. Made it a perfect height for our need.. My only concern is the ability of them to hold up to the weight for prolonged use."
3,a must have if you have a king size bed,"LOVE my co-sleeper, but you will need the extensions especially if you have a king size bed or a high mattress. Sweet dreams..."
1,Did Not Fit Older Model of Original Co-Sleeper,"While the construction of the leg extensions were sturdy, and the height would have been perfect for both a smaller and larger pillow-top mattress, the extension kit simply did not fit into our hand-me-down 8 year old version of the Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper (The plastic feet on the co-sleeper were not hollow to allow the extensions to snap in snugly, but had a large plastic rib cutting down the middle of the feet preventing anything from being put underneath safely).Had the Leg Extensions fit, they would have been an ideal solution to our tall bed."
1,No instructions,"Instructions do not come with the extension kit. I guess I will ""wing"" it and hope I don't mess it up! OUr bed is really tall, so we need the leg extensions to work."
1,Shop Around,"I agree that these extenders are an inferior product and an obvious attempt by the manufacturer to gouge additional money from consumers. We found a much better product at Bed Bath & Beyond. They are intended as bed height extenders, but work perfectly with the co-sleeper. In fact, they are muc more stable than the cosleeper and they are only $12.99. Definitely shop around!"
2,"Unsafe, unfortunately your options are limited","These extensions should have been included with the co-sleeper. As it is, the co-sleeper is lower than the average adult bed and the extensions are required if you want your child sleeping on your level. The fact that they sell it as a separate item is pure gouging for an extra few bucks, which is irritating. They are simple pieces of plastic and shouldn't add but a dollar or two to Arms Reach's cost.There are twelve pieces, so you can use a max of 3 pieces per leg to increase it to the maximum height. We had to do just that, and found that the three connected pieces are *very* unstable.It's too bad they charge so much for a poorly constructed set of unstable plastic pieces. What they should do is provide a set of pieces of varying heights, to prevent too many connections to a bed that's holding your precious child."
4,Leg extensions are best bet,"To bring the co-sleeper up to the height of the bed, these leg extensions are the best bet. Yes, as someone else said, they do make it a little shaky.So if you are not planning to attach the co-sleeper to your bed, you may want to leave the height alone. (You'll be getting up anyway, so it probably doesn't matter how tall it is.) But once attached to the bed with the anchor strap, rather than free-standing, it was very secure."
2,Not worth it - look at bed risers from Bed Bath and Beyond!,"After reading reviews about poor stability - in addition to the 20 buck price tag - my husband and I decided to get the 5"" bed risers (or lifters) sold at BBY. We are very happy with our purchase - the feet (castor and non-castor legs) both fit in the space allotted. It seems a lot more stable than the Arm's reach extenders - and you can't beat the $7.99 price!"
4,A necessity if you have a thick mattress,"These are absolutely necessary to get your co-sleeper to be level with the bed if you have a thick mattress (which most of them are these days). I used every single one of them. They seem like they wouldn't be very sturdy/stable, but once the co-sleeper is strapped to the bed, it doesn't move at all."
5,BUY THEESE not the bed lifts mentioned in other reviews.,"After reading ALL the reviews on the leg extension kit I decided to go with the bed lifts from bed bath and beyond first. They were HORRIBLE!! All the reviewers who stated that they were better were wrong they did not hold the co-sleeper up very well made it very un stable. I then ordered the leg extension kit and it was great it did the job that it stated it would do. If you need the co sleeper to be taller and very stable next to your bed, then I defiantly recommend the arms reach leg extension kit!"
3,They do make it taller...,"The leg extension kit does what it says, it makes your Arm's Reach taller. That being said, I was a little disappointed with the ""fit and finish"" if you will. The kit raises the co-sleeper incrementally, which is a nice feature, but as you stack the legs higher and higher, the legs get wobblier and wobblier due to about a quarter inch of play being added with each increment. Our bed height required the maximum length provided, so our co-sleeper is a little on the wiggly side now. Of course, there are the straps that reach to the other side of the mattress and you don't exactly move the thing around while the baby's in it, so if you need a little more height to match your mattress, they are a must have."
3,Raises to the right height but not very stable,"We searched all over for these extensions and settled for this color since we can't find the Espresso color anywhere. The extensions raise the bassinet to the right height but the stability is compromised. The bassinet just doesn't feel too stable and if you move it, you better double and triple check all the leg extensions because these pegs tend to dislodge when you move the bassinet. Our newborn doesn't weigh very much or move around much so I don't see the bassinet toppling over while he's in it. We've secured it to the bed for safety. But if you should use it away from the bed, then take the extensions off. It's just not stable enough to be freestanding with the extensions on."
2,Didn't fit our model,"It would have been nice to know that these would not fit our older, hand me down model. I had to return it to Amazon and figure out my own way to raise the co-sleeper."
5,Awesome True Crime Book,"What makes this book so compelling is that you get to hear the perspective of the actual prosecutor in the cases described. Through Marissa Batt's words, you get a virtual tour of the way the Los Angeles legal system works, or in some cases doesn't work. You are introduced to characters that actually inhabit Los Angeles, who actually went through the situations described - cases that are so intense and bizarre, they seem unbelievable. Through it all, you get a comprehensive version of the legal system mirroring human lives and decisions, as seen through the eyes of a person who does their job with integrity, intensity, and strength of character. READ THIS BOOK! It is a thorougly enjoyable read though shocking and extremely upsetting at times."
1,I should've kept my receipt....,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. If I hadn't bought the book I would've quit about 20 pages in and returned it. The author rambled on and on many times about unimportant things. I felt as though the storyline lost itself repeatedly and I was left asking questions throughout the story and even at the end. This Amber person might've ""helped"" (if you can call it help), the family but it's hard to understand why anyone would let a total stranger stay with them for such a long period of time. Anyways. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless you want to be frustrated and annoyed."
2,I didn't get it,"Forgive me, but I just don't get the hype. This had potential to be a really good story, but for me it never got there. The stream of consciousness voice from all of the characters was irritating. The story had some interesting twists, but never really came to fruition for me. I was hoping for something a bit more interesting, shocking, gripping. In reality it was just a family who couldn't get along, each member had their own crisis that a stranger shed light on and in some cases helped cure. Not a lot there for me to recommend."
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible","This has got to be the worst book I've ever read. How convenient that Amazon lists the good reviews first. That means most people won't read this. However, I'll give my two cents worth anyway. Several previous reviews state this book is funny, it's not! The book has no plot, no ending, and only a very fragmented, mostly deranged stream of thought in between. I can only guess that Ms. Smith was trying to be clever with her rambling list of web sites, use of etc. every few lines and endless droning on about cliches. It all falls flat because it all leads to no where and nothing. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Save your money for something by a different author!"
4,"Great virtuosity, small flaws","I come down on the side of those who see great things in this book. Yes there are some weaknesses: eg. I'm sure Smith could have found more effective and direct ways to make anti-Iraq War statements, and I agree with those that find the poems in the middle gimmicky. In my opinion, Smith creates four great characters and four captivating and emotionally powerful motifs whereby ""Amber"" shakes each one of them up. Each situation individually and collectively build up considerable tension. And I thought the prose was quite beautiful. All in all, I think what made me admire this book is that I found literary virtuosity where others found pretension. I will look forward to Smith's future books and will not be surprised if one turns out a classic"
2,"Too Much Writing, Too Little Story","More of a technically impressive book than an enjoyable one. The characters are with quirks that are fun to write -- the hyperintellectual daughter always using ""i.e"" in her monologues, the son experiencing the world as a math equation -- but that make them feel more like vessels for glitzy prose than actual individuals. The story is weighed down by the writing, and I found myself scanning whole pages to get to the next graf where something, anything, would actually happen."
1,An Award For What? Babble?,"This was definitely NOT my type of book. I thought several times of just giving it up. I can not, for the life of me, figure out how this book could possibly be up for an award. How hard is it to babble on paper? That is exactly what this author did. There were very few complete thoughts. Sometimes I felt like the author had written this book after drinking 15 cups of coffee. I find no talent in expressing yourself in a continuous stream of unorganized thoughts. I think the book was about a dysfunctional family who is invaded by an odd character named Amber. Why anyone would let a stranger stay with them for as long as they did is beyond me. Maybe a sign of how dysfunctional they really were. Amber does influence their lives in both good and bad ways. It's just so hard to understand the story line and the conclusion with the way it was written."
3,"Nice Enough wee story but at the end you go so what, bunch of middle class twats who cares.",Nice little story but at the end of the day all the characters ALL of them are so flawed I just didn't care about them and once I put the book down the characters disappeared from my mind. probably would have worked better as a proper short story
3,Less than extraordinary,"The much-praised The Accidental sees the Smarts: Eve, a writer, her philandering husband Michael, an academic, and their two teenage children, Astrid and Magnus, make a strange encounter on a summer holiday in a Norfolk village. The stranger, Amber, though her intentions are far from good, ends up transforming the family and, after a fashion, fixing its fraught set of relationships. The question, however, is whether psychological drama can work in the absence of complete realism. Amber's position amid her stranded, London-based hosts is left too vague, and too many obvious questions remain unasked, for The Accidental to be utterly convincing. This is entertaining, interesting as a proposition, and endowed with lively writing. It is an easily read novel. But it fails to achieve classic status, in my opinion, for a few subtle but essential flaws."
3,Mediocre,"I have to say I've never written an even indifferent book review before, but in this case, I felt compelled. I forced myself to finish the book and though there were interesting tidbits (Magnus' emotional turmoil), I would rate the reading experience as bordering on unpleasant. I found myself skimming entire pages at a time and becoming annoyed at the constant sentence fragments. I will admit that I went into the book anticipating a light read, and perhaps that is why I wasn't fond of it. The writing style requires interpretation throughout. I will even grant the fact that I am not a literary critic and thus may not understand the complexities of the story. I will leave it at this: if you are looking for a page-turner or other easily engaging story, skip The Accidental."
3,An OK Listen,"I listened to this book on CD. It was pretty engaging for the first few hours, but a little maddening at the ending. On the whole, though, I'd recommend it."
1,Horrible Book Club Read,If I did not have to read this for a Book Club I would have thrown it away immediately. It has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. Do not spend a minute of your precious time on this bizarre book.
1,"i.e., i.e., aeeeeeiiiiii","I borrowed this book from my local library after reading the positive and rather enthusiastic reviews. If I liked it enough I will get my own copy. But, no, I HATED this book. I promptly put this title and its author in my TOP 10 WORST LIST.The writing style is truly irritating and pretentious.What's with the i.e.s? I counted 9 within 35 pages, the author is condescending by explaining what i.e. is.She tends to repeat phrases, constantly writes short, 3 word sentences that made me want to throw the book against the wall (I can't because it's the library's).The story line has potential although a cliche. She could have done a better job but too absorbed with her own greatness.I had to finish the book to see if the story will get better but it did not for me. Right after I finished, my reaction was HUH?, EH? WHATEVER. I do not recommend this book unless you love to scream (in annoyance and frustration) for fun."
1,Waste of money,"After reading the other reviews, I was expecting a ground-breaking book with loads of new ideas & recipes. Unfortunately, all you get is 66 black & white pages (with big lettering) of information which is easily obtainable from websites such as millersoap.com (which is fantastic by the way) and others. There aren't even any pictures to enhance the experience. And, with its premium price tag, you just get the feeling you're being ripped off. Any sensible soapmaker should definitely look elsewhere - there are far, far better books available."
2,Better books exist.,"There is absolutely no structure to this book. It almost seems like a rushed blog to book. The formatting is horrible for the Kindle, all the lines run together. The book is hard to focus on as the author jumps around so much that it hardly seems she finishes a thought. Also, it seems most of the recipes use Crisco; if you want to stay away from hydrogenated oils look elsewhere. This is not recommended for a beginner."
3,I OWN 2 CDs 'CAUSE ONE IS BOB DYLAN LOVE & THEFT,"Maybe I missed the memo but the first Cuttin' Heads CD I bought actually had the music of Bob Dylan's Love and Theft CD on it. All the packaging was Mellencamp including the CD's screen printed art - trippy, So I have a Bob Dylan CD that is cloaked in Mellencamp Cuttin' Heads. Anyone else get that version. Let me know if you did or if anyone knows the back story. As far as a review - I am a big Mellencamp fan, but like many of his records you have to be a fan or you're not going to spin it too many times. Not my favorite, certainly not his best, but as a long time song writer with some commercial success (including a number one hit and some awards) I can appreciate the struggle to make your next work better than your last. None the less keep on Rockin' John. On the Bob Dylan version. Well Bob Dylan is a great folk writer and after seeing him live recently I must say his best days are blowin in the wind."
1,cuttin' heads rocks,"over the years i have sporadically listened to john's work. always like his stuff but not so much that i would want to get an album, cassette or cd. But i have this cd and i am glad i have it. if i were to have only one of john's work, this is the one. no regrets on this purchase, except that i can't wear this out like a cassette."
1,Lets hope he gets back on track with the next one,"It has been a real pleasure listening to Mr. Mellencamp evolve musically, but maybe this time he went too far. Rap and other collaborations just don't work here. Don't get me wrong, Human Wheels, Key West Intermezzo and Your Life is Now are three of the best songs ever written (and highly underrated), but nothing on this disc remotely makes it to the level of those earlier songs. Well, an artist as consistent as Mr. Mellencamp deserves at least one miss."
2,Politics again,"I love Mellancamp and especially Mr. Happy Go Lucky. That said, like so many artists, Mr. Mellancamp is at his worst when he goes political. It's not the politics that I object to, it's the way the politics seem to generally result in lackluster music. Too ernest, too strident, too self indulgent and too rightous. There is great political music of course, but not here."
4,Cuttin' Heads,"Out of the whole previous generation of singer-songwriters, the group including springsteen, petty, joel, etc., john mellencamp has turned out to have the most relevance and staying power. His most recent work, ""Cuttin' Heads"" contains another great single, ""Peaceful World"", which pairs him up with a current hot young singer, India.Arie (I'll get to her disc next time)and contains good grooves and relevant insights throughout. He still uses his trademark jangly guitar sound but he backs it up with the sounds of the new millenium and players versed in hip hop and urban grooves.well worth a listen, definitely worth the purchase."
1,In search of good songs,"After John's return to form with his 1998 self-titled album, i expected this to be a huge leap forward to the songwriting powersof ""Scarecrow"" or ""Human wheels"". Apart from one memorable song (""Peaceful World""), this record has nothing new to add to his work. What happened, John??"
2,Disappointed!,"I bought this for 3 Euros. Normally I would listen to his stuff first before buying because he can be very hit and miss in my opinion. Big Daddy was a hit for me, a very strong album, not one bad track, 5 stars, but this one is a miss. I was also disappointed with ""Human wheels"". ""Trouble no more"" was okay."
3,"Not his best work, but okay","Well, it looks like I'm going to have the first review of this CD. I'm better at reviewing books - with music I know what I like and don't like but maybe not the best at saying why. But I'll give it a shot.This CD is less of a hard-edged rockin' CD, it is more of a groovin' CD. (Though it does still have Mellencamp trademark kickin' drums.) I guess getting mellower seems to come with age. I haven't read the lyrics, so I don't know what all the songs are about. The title track, as has been widely reported, is critical of the use of the ""N"" word.Basically, I think that this CD is better for ""grooving"", listening to it while doing something else. If you are seriously listening to it, it doesn't have that many songs that sound particularly original.I'm a big Mellencamp fan. But I'm a bigger fan of Big Daddy and Scarecrow."
5,OUTSTANDING,The last time I bought his CD's he was John Cougar Mellencamp...but this CD definately a must have especially fits right in to the post Sept 11 disaster.
1,Nothing To Get Excited About,"Another let down from the King of Rock and Roll - Nothing To Get Excited About - Also, ""Women Seem"" was the worst Mellencamp concert song bar none"
5,Right On John!,"I met John Mellencamp once near his hometown in Indiana. He's a pretty simple guy, straight forward, calls em as he sees em. Many times one song grabs me, im hooked, im in! Peaceful World, is another song that rides in and out of my mind about real specific times and places in my life, most specifically good things, relationships done and undone, the future the past, and all the rest. Mellencamp's translation of life is as real as I-65 splits the Hoosier state in half. Review it? Yeah, pick it up, kick back and smile, it's more great stuff from the essential mid american artist."
4,Destined to become an essential recording,"Aside from the eerie photo of JCM that graces the cover of CUTTIN' HEADS, this is his best CD in years. Mellencamp's trademark Americana sound still resonates in these tracks but 50 year old Mellencamp isn't afraid to stripdown and focus instead his own lyric-driven sensibilities. The result is a refreshingly mature sound that is bound to win JCM new fans without alienating die-hards. A true message that doesn't have to beat the listener over the head to get his point across, tracks like ""Cuttin Heads"" and ""Peaceful World"" are sobering and timely (especially in the aftermath of the Sept 11 disaster.) I bought this disk yesterday and have been listening to it non-stop. Best tracks: ""Peaceful World,"" ""Deep Blue Heart,"" ""Women Seem,"" and ""Cuttin Heads."""
1,Too Mellow for Me,"I've always been a John Mellencamp fan (all the way back to Jack and Diane). It's been a while since I've bought one of his albums, but I bought this one on a whim. I should have read some reviews first. I'm very disappointed. Cuttin' Heads and Peaceful World are ok songs, but there isn't a standout in the bunch. Too many of them are too mellow. Pass on this album if you like the older stuff."
2,Mailed It In,"I've noticed a trend in the reviews here. Nobody finds the negative reviews helpful and everyone finds the positive reviews helpful - hmmmm. Also, the negative reviews seem to come from longtime fans. Add me to that list. I've been listening to Mellencamp (Cougar) since I was in college 20 years ago. I bought this CD prior to a long trip and listened to it about 3 times all the way through. It was really disappointing. My gosh, it was almost boring. Maybe those of us who remember the early work are still hoping for a return to the gritty sounds of classics like ""I Need A Lover"" or ""Don't Misunderstand Me."" If that's what you're looking for, you'd probably be well advised to stay away from this one. Mellencamp isn't ""fighting authority"" anymore."
5,Comeback of the decade,Just spent a couple days giving this album a good listen. Cuttin' Heads is a throw back to Lonesome Jubilee era Mellencamp. If you are a big JCM fan this is a must and if you are new to his music it is a nice starting point much better than his last two efforts.
4,Typical Mellencamp Album,"Ever since his 1985 signature album ""Scarecrow,"" John Mellencamp has settled into a comfortable groove, releasing albums that are always solid with a few standout tracks. ""Cuttin' Heads"" is no exception to the pattern, though it is his most overtly political album since ""Scarecrow."" The anthemic ""Peaceful World"" is his first radio hit in quite some time and has struck just the right post-September 11th cord. That same could be said about ""Crazy Island,"" another song that explores what it means to be an American. Other excellent tracks include ""Women Seem"" and ""Worn Out Nervous Condition."" Some of the songs are less successful, but there is not a clinker in the mix.Overall, with ""Cuttin' Heads,"" Mellencamp continues to enjoy a steady career of modest successes."
4,Dads Are There More Than Before,"This is a wonderful book for Dads and their daughters to read. I am somewhat perplexed by the criticism that ""mom is nowhere to be found."" In a growing number of instances Dad's are in fact left -- or seize -- the role of primary parent. Most books are mommy-centric and no one has a cow. Should Daddy-centric books be treated any different? When mom leaves children naturally fear Dad will someday leave too. This book certainly comforts daughters who worry if Daddy will be there and reminds Fathers how important it is that we are. Well done!"
3,"Comforting, but with a sense of melancholy","I read this with my 3-year-old some months after her mother filed for divorce (her mother has primary custody). We re-read it 12 times that day, only giving up because Daddy was worn out! It seemed to give my daughter comfort to be reassured that Daddies are always there. However, I do agree with Kirkus Reviews that it is a melancholy book -- the mother is not referred to in this book -- she's probably dead -- and the outdoor illustrations are as lonely as a Wyeth painting.Still, the book seems to acknowledge that not every moment in childhood is deleriously happy and fulfilling, while still giving reassurance of the strength of a father's love. The simple language is easily understood, and the illustrations are skillfully done. It is not a happy book, but a reassuring one, and we like it in my household!"
3,Kim Criswell Does Not Sing,This set is great for what it really is. One description says that there are dozens of vocals by Kim Criswell. She narrates an excellent history of the musical through the years BUT she sings ONE song. This is misleading to say the least.
1,Shakma dvd from Italian supplier,"I loved this movie when I saw it years ago, but was not able to find it on dvd, so I was very happy that this supplier had it in stock. What I should have paid better attention to was the fact that it was an overseas dealer, and the movie that arrived (after waiting approximately 12 or 13 days I think which seemed reasonable) was not even formatted to any of my dvd players (I tried it in 6 different players) I think it might have not even been in English, but I never got to find out because it wouldn't even play! Lesson learned.Be very careful not to order from overseas dealer unless you are absolutely certain of what you are getting. Not all dvds are formatted to play in all players."
3,a classic in monkey movies,"I give the this rating because its not ""All Region"", yes this movie is a classic; last time i watch this film was in the 90's. A must get movie, but copy is not ""A-R"". Unless you willing pay $75.00"
4,shockma...,"...(shackma) has at least 3 good actors in this decent original story premise of a ""2d game""-(i.e.one vs/more suspenseful than the other), w/ shockin action, makes this a somewhat memorable/likeable rare show that was once on scifi in late 90's or so, all to revisit at least once. enjoy, if ya can.the ending was cool; xcept did chris a. survive? c if ya can determine this in the shock-in endin."
5,Disappointed,"I have seen this movie numerous times before and was so happy it wasfinally available on DVD. So I ordered it on Sep 30 2008,and I have yet to recieve it. It was out of stock. Then my shippingdate was revised because it did become available. Now its unavailableagain. I don't know if i'll ever get my copy. : ("
5,It's a great classic!,"The game does not have much game play. The game has three missions, and training missions, which are like mini missions.The game is very realistic, and a lot of strategy is involved in the game. Before a mission starts, you can choose how many soldiers you want for the mission, what equipment they will have, and make plans for the mission.There are already default plans for each mission, so you don't have to make plans yourself.Even though it has few missions to play, the game is still fun.I used to play this game when I was younger, I love it! It brings back memories playing it. Thanks a lot Jewel Case!"
4,One of The Cds didn`t work!,"I think this game is good.But not enough.First, there are only 3 missions inside.Second, I ordered it directly from UBI SOFT.Then I got a problem.The Training CD just keeps crashing.Even I tried English Version WindowsWin XP. Win98...And the UBI Soft tried to help.But I still can`t read what`s inside.By the way, I got a NVIDIA GEFORCE2 MX400 for it.But still no use!"
5,Great book and good advice.,"The book is sound and provides solid advice. If you need tips on money and financial issues, this is the book for you. That's really all there is to it.You won't regret purchasing it."
3,"Succinct, Quaint, but Powerful",This is the kind of a book that leaves a small but indelible impression on those of us who are ambitious.
5,A Lifestyle Classic,"A superb book and absolutely essential reading for anyone serious about making a success in business, or indeed a success in life in general. There are indeed many books about self motivation and success on the market and some are very good indeed, but this one stands out and should be a tool in every serious minded entrepreneurs arsenal. I can also recommend Napoleon Hill's classicThink and Grow Richand anyone into sales and marketing, check out Simon Ashley Richmond'sWRITE AGAIN VOL 1, not strictly a business book, but what bizarre ideas that man has for persistent sales tactics."
5,Timeless Wisdom,"If you're business owner, marketer, or sell products to people, you can probably benefit from PT Barnum's book the Art of Money Getting. It's truly amazing how little things change over the years. This is an easy read, and a great addition to your collection. The particular edition is edited and formatted beautifully, and has a great introduction.The Art Of Money Getting: Golden Rules For Making Money"
5,Leadership is Everything,"PT Barnum knew important truths. He has been misunderstood by one of his most famous quotes, ""A sucker is born..."". I believe he was just recognizing how easy some folks are led astray. At his core he was a visionary. The truths that made him successful would do the same for anyone in anytime. A great book."
3,informative,"well this book was written so long ago yet it still applies to today's society. there r some good moral lessons here and of course sound financial advice, examples and metaphors. a qwik easy read."
3,Quick read,Old age advice that still rings true today. Great reminder for those of business mind and people trying to regain their compass.
2,Wordy and sexist,"There are a lot of quotes from wealthy people, but no other supporting evidence. The many references to men/man may alienate a female reader."
3,Must read but don't pay for it,Its a bit difficult to read through because of the writing style but worth the effort. Do not pay for the book though- look for a free download- this is a public domain work.
3,Not what I was expecting,"Based on some of the positive reviews I read, I went ahead and got the book since it was short and cheap. Needless to say I was a little disappointed. It provides good insight and might change the way you go about spending.. to an extent. It is a very conservative and ""religous"" approach. Short read, not bad. Wouldnt recommend to anyone looking to MAKE money, rather to whom looking to cut down expenses."
4,Succinct,"Of the modern business books I've encountered thus far, being a meager five or six from the past 20 years, this is the most direct communication of the majority of main points of the lot of them."
2,The Art of Money Getting - 150 YEARS AGO!!,"How old is this book? 150 years? I wish, that as part of the book description, Amazon would include the ""originally published"" date. If I had known that, I would not have downloaded this book."
5,Soulful Chicago-style blues & roots music!,"Damn, after listening to this CD, I'm hooked! There's some really catchy songs on it and I can't get them out of my head. The horn section is tremendous (very soulful and powerful). The CD flows with a nice mixture of blues and organic roots tunes. I especially like Michael's version of ""I Can't Keep From Crying, Sometimes"" and his own ""Straight To Her Heart"". This is a solid piece of pure listening pleasure here and, that's just what I'm about to do...again!"
4,Hatcher's notebook,One of about a half a dozen MUST have books if you have firearms and hand load for them.Steve AdamsAdamsQuailHunter on GunBroker & Ancientguns Forums
3,Hatcher's Notebook,"Fascinating classic publication. Hatcher was a firearms/explosives expert with the US army covering both world wars. Much detail on vintage firearms and their virtues and defects. Reports on individuals who managed to blow themselves up, mostly by accident. Details of which way up bullets come back down when fired vertically from a machine gun. Etc. A lot of the technical stuff is probably long out of date, but well worth a read."
5,Hatcher's Notebook,"The classic gun crank's book. If you have the slightest curiosity about any aspect of firearms design, ballistics, or history, Hatcher's been there & done that. One of those books you can pick up, open to any page, and start reading."
5,THE Book on how guns work,"General Hatcher was the Army's Chief of Ordinance during WW II. This book presents a wealth of information on how guns work. The mechanical details, specifications of steels used, heat treatment, testing, gun powder, ballistics, accuracy, records of US rifles, and anything else you want to know about. This is THE guide."
5,SO SORRY TO HEAR HE DIED,1 OF THE BEST DVD'S ON HOW TO PLAY GUITAR FINGERSTYLE.I HAVE PURCHASED MANY OTHERS WHO CAN NOT COMPARE TO THE WAY HE TEACHES.WISH I COULD BUY MORE OF THE BEGINNERS DVD'S OF HIS.OR FRED SOKOLOW.
4,Her Best Ever,"I just received the Duets CD as a Christmas gift and it is the best album that the incredble Streisand has ever offered her fans. I hate to admit it, but when I leave the house, I take the CD to play in the car and when I get home, I take it out of the car and back inside to play again. I can not get enough of this INCREDIBLE collection of timeless duets. I have a 8 speaker Bose stereo in my Concorde and everyone looked as I pulled into a local Dallas service station with Judy and Barbra singing.................I am sure they probably could have heard them in Houston. I can't get enough of this CD...the movie album was disappointing, but this more than makes up for it. I bought 6 CDs for friends and hope that more of the classical Barbra is still to come."
3,Only OK,"This was not the typical Barbra CD? It didn`t wow me like some of her non-duet CD`s usually do. It sounded like these songs were just thrown together for a quick sale. I played it through just one time, and probably won`t ever play it again. I purchased this production because of some of the good singers that she teamed up with. Sorry Barbra, do it alone the next time! I was expecting something similar to one of my favorites,"" A star is born "" with Chris Kristoferson... SUPER. Even Barbra can`t win them all."
4,"Great CD Cover, Average CD","If only the new Streisand ""Duets"" cd was as brilliant as its cover. To be fair- the cd is fine listening. It presents a career retrospect of duets that Streisand began in the early 60s. Barbra really began to understand the power and commercial potential of duets after 1978's enormously successful ""Flowers"" duet with Neil Diamond. The tracks featuring Kim Carnes and Don Johnson are particularily dated and trivial, but others are just weak songs with weak duet performances (Manilow, and Sinatra to name a few). Thankfully Mr. Gibb, Mr. Charles, Ms. Garland, Mr. Crawford, Mr. Mathis and others brighten the overall project. I too would like to see Ms. Streisand duet with others like Linda Ronstadt, Sting, Tony Bennett, or others on a NEW cd- but thanks Barbra for a sampling of the past- now let's look to the future!"
4,"Great, Babs!","A true collector's item. Listening to those duets you notice how Ms. Streisand -like the good wine- got better with the years. The best cuts: the one with Judy Garland, and the one with Ray Charles."
4,A Great Collection---but no more!,"I agree with just about everyone else on here: enough with the recycled packaged hits. Two best of collections in a year--that's a bit much.But, this cd is great. It showcases the wonderful voice and the precision that Streisand has as a singer; no other vocalist can match her.I think a CD of b-sides is a great idea. And maybe a collection of Streisand singing some great jazz standards a la Joni Mitchell or Diana Krall. And whatever happened to that CD of songs from movies she mentioned in her One Voice concert?I only hope she continues to put new recordings out there!"
3,"Lovely, but..........","I loved the CD, however, the price of the CD is not worth it. This stuff is previously released material except two new songs. Let's get out of ""rehashing"" and get into new material for the right price. Barbra, put that God-given voice to use in new material, don't waste it by rehashing the old material for profits for the record company and yourself. Consumers today are ""savvy"" and not dumb!"
2,Un peu mièvre mais si efficace,"Barbara me fait penser à Barbie, la poupée icne ; mais je pense que Barbara chante mieux que la poupée ; ici Barbara chante avec le gotha de la variété US ; tellement US de chanter en duo... les américains adorent ! Ils adorent aussi faire des disques spécialement pour Nol ! C'est comme à ; en tous cas pas de quoi bouder son plaisir, car Barbara a vraiment l'une des plus belles voix du monde. C'est parfois un peu mièvre et souvent très ""broadway""... pour les nostaligiques."
1,Rehashed music,"I am tired of these artists putting out rehashed music. It seems like all they do is put the titles of previously recorded music into a hat and pick out the order and put them on CD and then sell them to the public as ""new"" music. I call it lazy."
1,*RECYCLING TO CASH IN***,"Barbra I hope you read this.I am so tired of you not being a ""hungry"" artist anymore and it shows. In all the years i have been following your career ,that last concert where you gouged the public on the price of those seats for whatever reason....you lost me as a true fan and i now look at you as a RUG SALESPERSON.not to say a true carpetman hasn't any integrity. I do not buy anymore of your albums. How dare you recycle this music on this album.i wonder how many real fans bought it. We all have it. In your interviews where you've said I don't listen to ANY music(I never listen to mine.I understand that you've worked on it).but not to have music in your life.it says that I'm in this business for only the MONEYand not the artistic payback which is richer than any greenbackwhat a talent God has given this human and not to use it is a sin..There wasn't ZERO stars or I would have rated it that"
1,Another Streisand Retread,"When was the last time Streisand actually got in the studio and recorded a new album? It is sad to see a once-stellar artist in such decline. Everything she releases lately has been released before. She adds a couple of new tracks and depends on her loyal fan base to buy it up. No thank you. Barbra, please get in the studio and give us something new."
1,Instead of wasting your money on a recording of this ilk...,"...do yourself a favor and buy the new Linda Eder recording entitled ""Broadway My Way"". Her superior vocal stylings will leave you breathless...guaranteed!"
1,Streisand Duets,"Speedy delivery, very satisfied with the content, nice to hear tracks from a number of CDs compiled in this way."
5,Wonderful!!!,"Barbra Streisand is a musical legend. This is a great compliation! Love the song that she sings with Bryan Adams from the movie ""Faces in the Mirror."""
5,duets,I just love Barbra Streisand and nave nearly all her CDs and DVDs and have had Duets fpr at least one year and of course her work requires stars each and every time Joyce Maric
5,AWESOME CD,"I BOUGHT THIS CD SPECIALLY FOR BARBARA'S AND BRYAN ADAMS DUET,I FINALLY FOUND SOMEONE.WOW !!! WHAT A TREAT I HAD NO IDEA ALL THE OTHERE STARS WERE ON IT !!FRANK SINATRA,CELINE DION(AWESOME SONG)AND RAY CHARLES !! EVERY SINGLE SONG ON THIS CD IS A GEM !!!!VERY ENJOYABLE,AND JOSH GROBAN IN A DUET WITH BARBARA IS THE CHERRY ON THE SUNDAE....EXCELLANT CD,I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANY BARBARA FAN EVEN IF NOT A FAN...THANK YOU BABS..YOU DONE GOOD. WELL DONE !!!!"
3,Enough Is Enough,"Some are tired of the same old songs, and others have asked for remixes. For the ""No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)"" song, I would highly recommend ""Donna Summer VH-1 Presents Live & More"". The sultry Aussie, Tina Arena, sings the same part that Streisand originally sang. However, she sings it the way the song should be sung. Seeing her sing it on the DVD shows her put effort and emotion in to her singing. Streisand's version of the song is rather boring, and Tina Arena brings it back to life."
4,Class Act!,"It is a treat to Barbra fans worldwide to finally have a duet album released....putting her classic duets on one disk and adding two new tracks, one with the legendary Barry Manilow and the other gem with young opera singer, Josh Groban. The album takes the listener on an emotional journey.....there is the tender YOU DON'T BRING ME FLOWERS, the rocking disco NO MORE TEARS, the CLASSIC...MAKE NO MISTAKE HE'S MINE with Kim Carnes....great cd....the only complaint I have is in the remastering of the original recordings....they are still not up to modern day sounds and with the technology out there now, it could have been! But, Barbra's voice is such a gift!"
4,Great addition to my library.,It will be added to my CD folder I keep in my car. I only wish the CD contained more of her more popular duets.
2,"Looks and feels good, but was not the brush described.","The FIRST LINE of the product description stated that this pastry brush has NATURAL BRISTLES. That is NOT the case. They are a translucent plastic or nylon type synthetic fiber - Not at all natural, which is what I was looking for and thought that I was ordering. Other than that it looks like it would be a nice brush. It just does not suit my needs. I'm quite disappointed and will be returning/exchanging it when I'm done with this entry."
4,great value,"This is a great product for the price. It looks sturdy, and fits a small tv with components (which may not be the purpose it was designed for, but that's why we got it). It was easy to put together, my only problem was that the holes for attaching the bottom shelf were hard to find (with the attaching screws, since the holes were covered by the shelf)."
2,Not worth it,"The file drawer was relatively simple to assemble. However, one of the drawers was cracked where the side panels dovetail into the drawer face. The wood was actually broken. This was not something that occurred in shipping, after inpspection, I could see that small nails were driven in such a way to prevent a good dovetail and the assembler at the factory simply tried to jam it in, thus cracking the wood. Also, the bottom file door does not close flush. It protrudes approx 1/4 inch;. It is too much of a hassle to ship back so, with the assistance of liquid nails and some rigging, I'll live with it; altho', I will be cautious in what I oreder online..."
3,"Beautiful cabinet, poor assembly","The solid wood looks really nice, but the assembling of this piece will frustrate you. Most of the assy went together w/o a hitch. However, everywhere where the thin panels slide into grooves (i.e., the back, sides and drawer bottoms) was either poorly aligned or too small a groove (ALL of the drawer bottom grooves were too small...I ended up splitting 2 of these drawer pieces that contained the groove, so make sure you have some good wood glue on hand). One other thing of note (which may have been in the description of the product, but if it is, I missed it) is that the bottom drawer is a file hanging drawer ONLY. It has no back, bottom, or sides....just rails to hang folders on. So I gave this product 3 stars....5 for appearance and 1 for assembly for an average of 3."
2,disappointed,A little bit disgruntled; even though I read the other reviews I was hoping it would be a nice piece of furniture. The legs go wide and the shelf doesn't fit right. The knob also pulled right off.
3,An OK car,"Had fun with this car, but got bored with it quickly. It didn't climb off road very well...not even in regular length grass."
4,A Handy Guide For Beer Can Hunters,"This 157 page, softbound 5 x 8"" book is handy to keep with you as you look for beer cans to add to your collection.

3,"Two boys' review: Transformers fans will love it, other kids will tire quickly","This is a great toy for a weekend, for a costume party, for Halloween. Older kids will enjoy it more than younger children. The helmet has straps but they can only do so much to keep it upright.The pre-programmed voices are best. I wish there had been more of them. The voice changing feature works but it makes you sound more like a generic robot than a Transformer.This was a gift for our 4-year old son. It was a nice gift and made for a couple days of fun but he had more fun with a handful of Transformers action figures.Now, give this to a 40-year old Transformers fan with a case of nostalgia and he'll likely rate this helmet five stars."
5,Even my husband loved this one.,We couldn't keep the grownups off this one. Now my 28 year old son wants one! It was a huge hit with the 5 year old crowd too. It appears to be well made and has withstood the 5 year olds AND the 20 somethings.....
5,Mom plays with it too!!,"This helmet is so much fun!! My son LOVES to come up behind me (while I am totally not expecting it) and say something to me while wearing the helmet. It REALLY does change your voice. This was one of the few Christmas presents my son actually continues to play with. As a matter of fact, all of the adults were taking turns playing with it too! Great idea, and great toy!!"
4,Transformers Voice Changer Helmet,"I bought this toy for my son for his 6th birthday, and it was a big hit - for everyone at his birthday party!"
2,for a few cents more could have been better,"Nice concept. but the straps for adjustment are poor at best. if they would have spent a few cents more a strap the toy would have been much better. Parts do come off, do double sided tape is a must, and the lenses that you look through are so distorted walking more than a few feet would be a danger to any child enclosed. Over all poor at best."
4,"""Wicked awesome!""","""Wicked awesome!"" was my son's first response when he opened up his new Optimus Prime helmet. He uttered more positive exclamations after he had a chance to open the package and try the helmet on. He had so much fun in it, we had a hard time talking him into taking it off at bedtime. He wanted to sleep in it!The helmet is much better, both in quality and ""awesomeness"" than his Darth Vader helmet, and makes way cooler voice-changes! It is by far his favorite toy, and he got some pretty great ones for Christmas.The only educational value is stimulation of my son's imagination, but overall, the toy has provided some great fun for all of us. I am so glad we bought it!"
5,A blast!,The kids - big and small - love this item. Voice changer really works! 5 out of 5 star item.
2,"Optimus Prime Voice Changer- neat idea, but not great quality for the money","We soon discovered that this would be awesome if there was a volume/microphone control. The pre-programmed phrases worked fine, but when the microphone was turned on to change my son's voice, it was too loud and full of static like a blown speaker. It sounded better if he took it off and spoke while it was further from his mouth, but that is no fun if he can't wear the helmet. We paid almost $50 dollars for this including shipping to get it by Christmas and my son only played with it a couple of times. If the glitches were corrected, it would be well worth the money, but as is, it was a waste."
3,Not really for 5-6 year olds,I read alot about this toy before buying and I actually thought when you had the helmet on and you spoke it made your voice sound like the transformer....thru some voice changer.......but it doesn't - you have to reach up and hit a button to make it make sound. I had bought the laser guns with it (which weren't actually laser) and you can't hardly hold on to the helmet while you work the laser guns (guns took 14 batteries!!) The helmet seems constructed pretty good except the back head strap - and it does not look cheaply made at all. I think this is for a bit older of a child - I am not sure what age.
5,Be Optimus and the Rocketeer with this mask!,"with three masks on the market (Excluding batman) Ironman, Optimus and Darth vader, this mask rules them all. It almost looks like the Rocketeer mask as well! its a full helmet it covers everything. You can even use your imagination and be Tom from Toonami! this is a cool toy as it has Peter Cullens voice edition and not that stupid beast wars voice get that one for I have that one. Anyway this is a great mask and has peter cullens voice and you sound like a robot so much fun could be done with it!!! :D"
1,This is what it is,"After a lot of searching, I located Intec's web site and found the product that Amazon was so kind not to describe to us.It is a Power Inverter (adapter) that plugs into your car cigarette adapter. Then you plug your game console (PS2, GameCube, XBox, whatever) into this adapter. Along with one of the many portable T.V.s or screens, you can play on the road.Amazon won't allow a link to the company website, inteclink, so I'll have to settle to tell you to do a search on Amazon itself with the phrase, ""Universal Game Inverter"" to find similar products."
1,Buyer beware,"The item that was offered for sale is not the item I receivied, so I'm not to happy but I kept it so I dont have to go through the hassel of sending back the item."
5,As real as it gets,"A two word phrase can sum up my opinion of Loren Christensen's book, Reality Check. This book's look at what life is like on skid row is an in your face description of what some people have to go through each and every day. At times I found myself laughing out loud, and others weeping out loud, all with the realization that this was not fiction, it was truth. In Christensen's classic literary genius, he was able to not only capture my attention and mind, but my heart as well."
2,Mac Users Beware!,"I thought - cool - this is just what I need to start up my home recording studio with my Mac. Unfortunately, author Ben Milstead has nothing relevant for the Mac user and in fact discourages potential computer buyers against the Mac. All the ""hands on"" uses the Windows operating system and Sonar software. Nothing for the Mac user here. If I would been aware of this beforehand, I would have not purchased the downloaded version, instead opting for a more friendly Mac book. I think the description should have mentioned the non-Mac slant. The other half of the book I can use is good, but I feel I got only half my monies worth. The old adage of ""Buyer Beware"" is still one of importance in the digital age. Mac users stay away from this book, as I am sure there are better alternatives for us non Windows users out there."
3,Content great; condition questionable,"The content of the book is great, see the other reviews here for summaries. Delivery was on time, 1 day early in fact. However, the condition of the book dropped my rating to a ""3"".I ordered this book directly from Amazon as ""new"". It arrived with 2 holes through the front cover and first 20 pages or so, as if from a large staple. Also, 1 corner of the back cover was folded over and creased multiple times. At the end of the day, this isn't a huge deal, but I am somewhat OCD about my books and like to buy them and keep them in good condition. If I wanted a book in this condition, I would have ordered it ""used"" and saved a few bucks.*This is first time I have received product from Amazon in condition other than what is described on the website."
5,Cover's brilliant articles assembled,One of the most sophisticated reflections on law in modern times.The book brings together for a general audience articles by Robert Cover which are difficult to find for non-lawyers.Cover has a brilliant mind and a hard-to-match erudition. Editing and accompanying chapters/commentaries impeccable.
3,"A thought-provoking,worthwhile read.","This is a managable text,even for the novice in African current afairs and is written by the co-director of the Africa Rights group,based in London. De Waal contends that the causes of famine are invariably political and avoidable.He is critical of the activities to date of many aid agencies and observes that they have in many cases paradoxically perpetuated the very crises they have been seeking to end. This work has raised many questions for me and is a starting point for further reading on the subject of how aid to developing countries can be best delivered."
5,delicious and addictive!!!,"i ran across this over the winter and spread about 1/3 of it over a block of cream cheese and served it with crackers. guests ate it up and asked where i got it.i quickly ran out and inadvertently threw the jar away before jotting down the name. went back to where i got it (an emporium), and it was gone. just found it again, and i am ordering several to have for parties as well as to give as gifts.this stuff is fantastic!!!i, too, am not a fan of spicy, but when you serve it on cream cheese, it keeps it calm for the palate.highly recommended!!!"
4,English subtitles at opensubtitles.org,"This is a delightful film - worth the effort of converting to avi, attaching the user-created English subtitles, and burning back to a disc.;-)PJ"
2,Good product for the ankles,"First, this is not a wrist weight. I purcahsed the 20lb wrap and it says that it is a wrist weight. I believe this is, if not false advertising, then pushing the envelope. There is no difference in the design from a normal ankle weight, you just tie it around your wrist. You would think if it could accomodate the wrist, they would design it so you could pass your wrist through the middle for better support. At 20 lbs, you can't have this slipping all over the place on your arm which it does. So, as a wrist weight it gets 0-1 stars. As an ankle weight, it is what it is and gets the job done. I'd give it a 3 if they sold it as only an ankle weight and didn't try to make it more than it is, but 2 stars for misleading marketing."
2,Definitely NOT a wrist weight.,"This is purely a case where a vendor figured they sell one item as another by simply calling it something else. I'm a big guy (6'2"", 200 lbs) and I couldn't begin to wear these as wrist weights. They slide/flop/spin/etc. all over the place. They ARE great ankle weights, securely fastening and staying in place. I wear them on training runs with a weight vest. Originally I had bought them to wear as wrist weights while running as 10lb. per arm wrist weights are pretty much impossible to find. Without a thumb hole (which would allow you to stabilize the thing), they just don't work. So, as an ankle weight 4 stars. As a wrist weight? Hardly. This vendor needs to check their marketing practices."
1,Poorly designed,"Very disappointed Kitchenaid fan. This spatula is not only too large and poorly balanced, but also broke recently when dealt some routine cooking abuse. Snapped right at that pretty narrow neck. Futhermore, the plastic handles are not heatproof like the silcone, so if you leave it leaning on the pan or the stove, it will melt. What's the point?"
2,Too thick.,"The blade is unusually thick for a turner; if I have a slick and greasy pan I find it difficult to get it under the food instead of just pushing it around. And when the pan isn't slick, the extremely soft and flexible edges become a disadvantage, as they're not good at scraping off anything that's really *stuck* to the pan.It does clean up easy, and it doesn't yet show any signs of wear, I just don't find it especially effective to use."
3,"Okay, not great, but pretty nice.","I like this spatula okay, although I agree it's poorly balanced. However it is good for cakes and such. I don't like it on eggs because the eggs stick too much to the silicone."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this spatula/turner because I trusted the KitchenAid brand name. They may make great mixers, but not spatulas. I have used my spatula for turning pancakes, eggs, etc. The plastic has melted at the tip (and on the bottom near the tip) and it's too thick to really be of much use. Don't waste your time or money on this product."
1,The handle traps dishwater,"I ran it through the dishwasher and put it away. The next time I used it, I applied a little pressure to scoop something out of the skillet and a bunch of trapped water ran out of the hollow handle and into my food. I think the dishwasher filled it up with water.Too bad because I generally have a high opinion of Kitchenaid."
1,Don't like it,"I'm not happy with this turner. It isn't versitile and won't handle most of the food I would use it for. I chipped the edge the second week I had it, which renders it even less usable. My cheap stainless steel turner with a good edge that I got 30 years ago is a lot better. I am sorry I bought this one, and won't be ever buying another one. Wasted my money."
4,Goes well with morning coffee any day,"I bought this album several years ago on cassette which I no longer have. I was happy to stumble across it again while exploring music by Mannheim Steamroller. I hadn't realized that Chip Davis was the founder of Mannheim Steamroller, but now that I know, I understand why I enjoyed the compilation of Sunday Morning Coffee so much. I actually do play this album while my husband and I are lingering over our first cups of coffee - a gentle, uplifting, a little jazzy, musical start to any day. Feel free to substitute your favorite morning beverage and listen to this delightful album any time of day or night for that matter. As my budget permits, I'm planning to purchase Sunday Morning Coffee II."
5,One Of John Cale's Best,"John Cale has released many great albums throughout his career, including Paris 1919, Music For A New Society, Artificial Intelligence, his collaboration with Lou Reed Songs For Drella and the great live album Fragments of A Rainy Season. His three best albums, however, were recorded during his seminal ""Island Years."" These three albums were Fear, Slow Dazzle, and Helen Of Troy. Helen of Troy is possibly the weakest of these three, but still remains an incredible album. Cable Hogue, My Maria, and Sudden Death are all stand out songs. The best on the album are I Keep a Close Watch, Pablo Picasso, Coral Moon and Leaving It Up To You. Also, Cale's cover of Jimmy Reed's Baby What You Want Me To Do is just as good, if not better, than the original. This is one of Cale's best albums and is essential to any fan."
2,Drawer was broken,"1 of the drawers on the desk was broken. When it was constructed the wood split. I tried going through the manufacturer to get it replaced, and they sent the wrong color, and also the drawers were in broken even worse!! The workmanship was horrible! buy the desk if you are just looking for something that you don't care if it may fall apart..."
5,Great fot small space,I bought this for my mother when she wanted to downsize her desk. She was very pleased with it.
2,Reads like a PhD dissertation,"Urry seemed to condense what should have been 600 pages into 150. And they were some of the hardest 150 pages I've read. Complexity theory is a fascinating topic and its application to globalization is definitely relevant. However, I found Urry very difficult to follow and I was left unconvinced. I would strongly suggest reading M. Mitchell Waldrop's book ""Complexity"" to get a much clearer perspective on the theory."
3,"highly readable, interesting","...""Time of Hope"" has its Keating analogue do the narrating (it's in first person). Yes, we assume Dominique Francon considers herself superior to Keating, whereas Sheila waffles in this respect over Elliot, but here there is no Howard Roark to compare Elliot to. Yes, Keating is a plagiarist as well as a social climber, but he plagiarizes only Roark, and again here there is no Roark. Yes, Elliot calls Sheila ""schizoid"" and seeks to characterize her as a sort of Zelda Fitzgerald, but her actual behavior in the book has nothing whatsoever of the psychotic about it.So what's the point? Beats me. This is a story of a man determined to rise from the lower class who does--to a point. He comes to decide that his rise is checked by the very thing that engendered it, his mother's ambition for him, but this is HIS reading; he may be wrong."
4,To Be MOVED WITHOUT Moving,"if these vibes don't touch you, you don't have skin, if these sounds don't bring you to tears, you don't have eyes, if the drums don't make your blood pump, you don't have hart, if the trumpet blows and you refuse to hear, you lost your soul."
1,Why is this not text to speach enabled for the Kindle Fire????,"You would think that if you are going to put something new on the market that's suppose to be better then the previous versions you'd make sure that it offered everything the older models did PLUS the new wiz-a-ma-gigs. I needed this to be text to speech for the Kindle Fire, and was siqued that the new Kindle would be color and better then the older models.. to my disappointment, practically all the books I purchased for school, actually all the books I purchased were not, I repeat were NOT text to speech enabled... If I had known I wouldn't have bothered buying the kindle edition of the book or the Kindle Fire."
3,Expensive,"Of the eight books I bought, it was the most expensive (cost per page) for all that I received. Although it was in great condition, so were some of the others."
4,Excellent,"This text gives some helpful insight into the much celebrated Socrates through the eyes of his ""student"" Plato. Reading the chapter on ""Apology"" demonstrates the complete failure of Socrates to discount the charges against him made by Meletus (and others) regarding his ""corruption of the young"" and questionable worship of the Greek pantheon of gods. Quite eye opening."
4,A musto to have accesory...,"Very simple and very useful. You can assemble it without any addional tool, it includes all necessary. It is very light to transport and most convenient then any house-table you can use for your keyboard. You can change height to use keyboard standing up."
1,Automatic Lites,I may have gotten a defective one but I could not get the sensitivity adjusted so that it did not go on and off all night
4,Great motion detection,"I purchased this light to replace a very unreliable motion light, and I have been completely satisfied. Its impossible to sneak past this light. If I had to think of a negative, it would be that it's sometimes a little too sensitive, but this can be easily fixed by turning of the power to the light. Great product!!!"
1,Motion not necessary for this light to work,"This light is garbage. I am sending it back for a refund. All attempts to get it to work properly have failed. Even with the sensitivity turned as low as it goes, the light continues to trip falsely. Spent a lot of time trying to adjust it. It works great in ""Test"" mode. I give it one star as it won't let me give it zero stars."
3,"Good fixture, not flexable in use","This lighting fixture has some good features, good build quality and looks but is lacking in some areas that were important to me but not evident from the product information. They do not work with Compact Flourescent Bulbs (CFB). The light will work when they get a motion signal to come on, but when the timer times out, the light act like a strobe light, flashing very rapidly. Also, I wanted to have some of the fixtures I ordered to operate nightly from dusk to daylight on the photocell and not from the motion signal. You can set this mode by switching the light switch, but you have to do so every day as the unit resets itself each day.So, if you are using standard light bulbs and want standard motion detection switching, this is a five star fixture but not for my use."
1,inferior quality -- don't buy,Two of these units stopped working because the housing container filled with water. I noticed this when I was trying to troubleshoot. I turned the control to Test and a lot of waterr started dripping out.Both units were professionally installed. I am in the process of replacing the second one now.
2,Too Sensitive,"I live in a very windy area and even on the least sensitive setting with the motion detector pointed towards the ground this light will activate. That isn't the problem. The problem comes when it activates and you have it on a 1 minute timer, but it never turns off. The problem is sporadic and is tied to the wind. If the wind is very high, then the leaves, brush or whatever seems to be triggering the light and having two flood lights on most of the night is not only a waste of power, but it probably annoys the neighbors as well.The light itself is nice. It fully iluminates the yard and nobody is going to hide in the shadows with this light on.Motion sensing is the way to go. At least it turns off some of the time."
1,not so good,the cover falls down with the potty inside. there is another brand that has magnets that stick the potty to the cover- makes much more sense. This is very plastic and the front edge of the child sized seat was very sharp. i returned it so my kids didnt get cut on their bottom.
5,New and improved?,"I recently bought this and wanted to note that I think the manufacturer has been reading the reviews and made updates. The package I received said to take the bolts off of your existing seat, but the hinges had bolts already permanently molded into them. It also has a small tab below the front of the child potty to keep boys from spraying on to the adult seat. So far my child, who previously was skiddish about sitting on the big potty, has loved it and I've had no problems."
3,great idea but not working for us,"With young 2 year old twins potty training 2 little pottys just wasn't working for us so we wanted to get rid of 1 and this seemed like a great way to make them feel comfortable with the big potty. To that it works great & they do use it. The problem we have is that when they pee it gets all over the regular seat that's underneath if they're not lined up right over the hole so we're still cleaning up pee after most uses (and if you don't know they've used it and you go to use it, well you just need to look before you sit!). If it didn't cost so much to ship back we would."
4,Mark V,"The over used term ""Heavy Duty"" in not mis-applied to this product.It is large and heavy.Has a nice tall heavy handle.I have not used it enough to attest to its scale's accuracy yet.However the indicator seemed overly simple. It consists of a short piece of round stock ground to a point, bent about 95' and inserted into the guide over the scale AND IT MOVES.I'll have to fix that one day. A small problem, especially considering the cost."
4,Not the Best,"A Book worthy of a read, but nowhere near George R.R. Martin's riveting A Song of Ice and Fire series. Do yourself a favor and make sure to pick up Martin's books after reading this, as all other fantasy will look poor after the enlightenment."
3,good but not great,"I read a song for arbonne and liked it (7 out of 10) and hearing how Tigana was supposedly kays master work i couldn't wait to read it. Maybe i should have. Whereas asfa had a great central character with a weak protagonist Tigana is the opposite. I liked the villains brandin and alberico but the centra characters just weren't that enthralling. And by far the biggest flaw was TOO MUCH EXPOSITION. It seemed kay had to fill us in on every petty detail, especially in the beginning, and ramble on with thick narrative. While this wasn't as bad as some of todays hackneyed fantasy market (hear that goodkind and farland!) it slowed the book down. Althought the book wasn't all bad it didn't live up to the hype."
3,Well-written but lacking in action,"I had read many of the reviews on Tigana, and it seems like a book that many people are divided over. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have wasted my time reading it, and I think there are a lot of better fantasy novels out there. In the end, what bothered me was that even though the characters are likable and it's well-written - nothing happens! The book is over 700 pages, and most of it is basically Season 3 of Lost with a lot of elaborate back stories. I would not recommend this book to a friend."
5,Excellent integration of fantasy and alternate history,"I wasn't going to add my voice to the chorus, but I too was astonished at some of the negative reviews. As a political scientist who works on the medieval period, I find this novel convincing and absorbing in its sweep and political detail (despite some anachronistic nationalism). Truly one of the finest fantasy novels of the last decade, with compelling backstories and intricate plays on historical political and religious struggles. As Kay has matured as a writer, he has also finally successfully integrated expository and narrative writing in a way which would have improved the otherwise excellent Finnovar trilogy."
5,The best book i've read inspite of the niggling problems,"I loved _Tigana_. I loved the characters, story, use of magic, etc. Even though i was confused a couple of times (e.g. what's with the dreamwalker sequences? where do they fit in?) I still love book, have re-read it several times, and will re-read it several more. People seem to always complain (or at least comment) that ""Kay's no Tolkien!"" No kidding! He's his own writer! all i'm saying is this: Read TIGANA once. if you don't like, don't re-read. If you do, you will recommend it to everyone you know. I did."
5,"Fantastical, Magical, Awesome","Another Great author, Guy Gavriel Kay gives this book a magical quality that won't let readers put it down. A novel filled with magic, betrayal, war, love, and fantasy! Certainly one of the best books of all time!"
4,Slow to start but great to end,"I read this book for the Sword and Laser podcast and it was great. The first few chapters were very slow but when I got about 100 pages in, the whole book came alive. I finally got where it was going and why I should read it. I still prefer the world building of Jacqueline Carey but this was so well done. I did not expect how some of the the characters evolved but as I look back now, it all makes sense. The last sentence just ripped out my soul but it was well written and the plot never went exactly where I thought it would go which is a good trait for a book to me. If you can get a copy of the book from the library, you should definitely try it out as it is worth pushing through to get to the full story. Tigana, I will scream your name through the world!!! (that makes more sense once you read the book, I promise.)"
5,A wonderfully complex novel,"Most works of fantasy are melodramas - the author sets up a 'good guy' and a 'bad guy,' making it pretty clear all along that you should root for the good guy. It's something fantasy readers have grown to expect. It's the absence of this that makes Tigana such a wonderful book. Kay breaks the genre with this book, and after reading it, many fantasy novels seem shallow in comparison. He sets the reader up, really - at the beginning, he lets you think you know who the protagonist is. By the middle you're not sure any more. This isn't a melodrama. If you like your fantasy with hard lines between good and evil, this won't be your cup of tea. It's a character-driven story with depth well beyond most fantasy novels. There is no doubt in my mind that this is one of the finest works of fantasy ever written."
1,The title should be: Don't Bother,"Very predictable, slightly cheesy, tedious, no real character development (I absolutely did not care about any of the main characters). This was one of the worst fantasy books I've read so far and it makes me hesitant to pick up another one (Although Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrel gave me hope). It would be better to reread some great books (JRR, Little Big, De Lint, etc.) and not waste time on this one."
4,Wow.,"Okay, not many books get better than this. If you like books that move, captivate, and stun you, 'Tigana' is one of the best. I have to say, it is a book for mature audiences, but I think that it's worth it. Very well worth it. It brings the emotions of a lost people into the open, and gives you two, completely different perspectives. Even though the ending leaves you completely hanging, it is easy to finish it off yourself. 'Tigana' is a wonderful book, overall, if you don't mind semi-sad endings."
4,People have it backwards,"Many people are complaining that they don't have nearly as much sympathy for the protagonists as they do for the antagonists. Perhaps it's because they have them backwards. I think by the end of the book, Brandin IS the protagonist, not the Tigana people.And I agree that he ended the story rather poorly; it seems rather slap-dash and messy, when there are so many opportunities to make it beautiful, meaningful, or tragic.I'm also going to have to add my voice to the others who claim Kay is among the best writers that live. And he shouldn't be compared with Tolkein! It has become a meaningless comparison due to overuse."
4,Good Adventure Story,"It's good, very easy to read, satisfying and predictable, well written. Maybe about 100 pages too long! I liked the book but can't understand all the hype about it. It's not like the author invented the wheel or anything!"
2,Over-rated: Not in Tolkien's League,"I can't believe the number of reviews of this book that try to draw comparisons with LotR. Not even close. Don't get me wrong; Kay is a very good writer, but it's ludicrous to draw this particular comparison. Can you imagine incest as a major plot point in Hobbiton?Other readers have lionized Kay for writing his characters with shades of gray. In this novel, this attempt centered around two characters whose merits I could never accept. I realize that he wanted to keep them ""real"", but I couldn't buy his attempts to make Brandin ""tragically understandable"". Nor could I ever justify Dianora's love for him, given her past and his continued reprehensibility.What I was really looking for was a great fantasy that I could share with my teenage son as we had LotR. This was certainly not it. If what other reviewers write here is true: that this is one of the best fantasies around, maybe I should stop looking."
1,Why does a book so bad have to be so long?,"Over-dramatic, self-indulging, and downright boring.I am writing this review for all of those who are about to make the mistake of reading this book. I already have.I absolutely hated the characters. Why? Mainly because everything is a matter of life and death. Everyone is ever so eager to sacrifice their lives, fight to the death, and swear life-changing oaths. Its typical bad fantasy.Kay does have the power of vivid description. Unfortunatly that has gone to his head as his novle is several hundred pages too long. A lot of the sideplots in the story end up being irrelevant or uninteresting. I finished the book only because I was too stubborn to quit after investing so much time in reading it.Please, there are much better fantasy novels out there. This one is not worth your time."
1,"Finally, a fantasy novel that emphasizes homosexual sex","And consider how many fantasy novels you've read and at the end have thought, pretty good, but where was all the homosexual sex? If that's your bag, then this is the book for you. Fantasy? No, not in the LOTR or Wheel of Time or Song Of Fire and Ice or Malazan or Black Company or Mistborn or Amber Chronicles or Name of the Wind or Belgariad or Shannara or any other great fantasy books kind of fantasy. But definitely the homosexual sex kind of fantasy."
2,very predictable,"Why are people so enthusiastic about this book? It is average at best, with a very predictable plot and setting. The worst aspect of the book is that the main characters are poorly drawn, presented as simplistic, unidimensional, and often highly unpleasant people. The only reason I bothered to finish reading it was because it was pouring rain outside."
3,Political fantasy,"Overall, this was a good book. I never got so frustrated that I considered giving it up, but there were several spots where it dragged, where Kay seemed to drone on and on about things that weren't all that important. If you're into political thrillers set in a fantasy world of magic, this is a book you'll probably enjoy."
4,Unique and beautiful fantasy,"THE GOOD: This is definitely one of the better fantasy books that I have read. He creates a very rich and immersive world, you really feel like you are a spectator to the events. Every detail and subplot is seamlessly woven into the larger story, there are no insignificant characters. Overall, this is a book that will stay with you and is worth reading.THE BAD: The author falls into a common trap for fantasy writers. His female characters are unbelievably flawless. Every last one is beautiful, enchanting, and horny. I wish that the women in the book were more natural and realistic, instead of the typical fantasy babes. This is the only aspect of the book that keeps it from being 5 stars."
5,Another fine outing from Kay,"I have read a few of Kay's novels so far and all of his characters invoke a sense of empathy from the reader that I think only a few other writers can emulate (i.e. Martin). Tigana is another fine book from Kay, and though in my opinion it is not as good as a 'Song for Arbonne' the author nearly effortlessly is able to promote feelings of loss, despair, passion and love all at once in the reader that make this book a must read!"
5,"A Beautiful, Intriguing Story","Tigana is a fascinating read- the story is both beautiful and intriguing, and obviously carefully crafted. Though the world the action takes place in is very different from ours, the characters and issues are refreshingly human. If you don't pick up Tigana now, you'll miss out on a LOT."
3,Not sure why people love GGK so much.,"This book is a 10 maybe on a scale of 1-15! It is an OK read, but I won't read it again. I don't find his world building, or his characters very believeable. Maybe I just don't like books where people's heads explode!"
2,pitty it has artificial sweetners....,"I like the taste, and in the few months I took it I think I can say it worked great. I don't know how I missed it, but it contains Sucralose; so I switched (once more) out to other Protein Powders -- ones that don't contain artificial sweetners... (Whey Protein Isolate from BlueBonnet, Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold Standard Natural Whey, and Body Choice RTD's)."
1,Died after 7 weeks use.,"I purchased one as a Christmas gift. Now on Feb 8th it's died. It worked for a total of 6 weeks. If I'd have kept all the packaging etc, I'd send it back, but of course I didn't. I won't buy this brand again."
5,Excellent Product,"I keep this around my neck - it goes from home to work to school with me and I keep a ton of stuff on it. Well worth the price, I highly recommend this product to everyone."
2,Crashed On Me,"Had it for 4 months and it was working fine. Always safely removed it. but after 4 months it stopped being recognized as Lexar Jumpdrive and when i tried to access it it said Drive not formatted. When i formatted it, it stuck halfway and said. unable to format drive. Maybe i got a bad stick {it happens sometimes} but then i checked it out and alot of people had the same problem. Bought a Kingston DataTraveller and Sandisk Cruzer Mini, had them for over 8 months and they're working perfectly."
4,You might think all USB thumb drives are the same...,"Well, they aren't. I picked this one for my needs based on the reviews, and the recent Ars Technica article on USB thumb drives, which gave me a better idea of what to look for (google it).First off, don't be fooled by drives that claim that they're USB 2.0. What you want is a USB 2.0 high-speed device. If they do not claim to be high-speed, or say how fast they are, assume that it is 'USB 2.0 compatible... ie. USB 1.1.Another consideration is whether the device is a low-power device. If it's not, you won't be able to use it with unpowered hubs (or Mac keyboards).This device is quite fast, at about 6mb/s throughput and is also a low power device. It includes a write protect switch if you want to protect your data from accidental deletion. About the only thing missing is that this device does not support being used as a boot drive. That's not a feature I needed.I recommend it highly."
2,Blocks space of 2 ports,"It works, but too bulky. When I used it in my ThinkPad A31, I was not able to use the second USB port"
1,Never again,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it was dead by March. I'm actually online right now to get a new one...but CERTAINLY not this brand.
2,Read if you have a USB hub,"It doesn't work when plugged into a USB hub on my Dell Dimension 4100 running Wiondows XP SP1. It is recognized as a USB Mass Storage Device, not as a Disk Drive. It works OK when plugged directly into a USB port, but that's an annoying inconvenience since they are all in the back of my machine.Two attempts to contact Lexar Tech Support, one by phone and one by their online system, were unsuccessful."
5,Price + Performance = Great Value!,"I've had a 64MB USB 1.1 drive from another company for a few weeks and really love it, but when I saw the price on this drive, I couldn't pass it up. I've used it on my USB 2.0-compliant system with these results: moving 200MB of files, writes in <50 sec., reads in <15 sec! Very quick! Excellent performance. Excellent value.As I've not had the device for long, I cannot comment on its durability."
1,Mac Users --> Beware,"For Mac users, this product may not be ideal.It will not work from the keyboard USB port on many that I tried Macs .Theyr were all G4's running OSX 10.2.6.This means that I must crawl around to the back of my machines and plug in back there. Or find a powered USB port that works with the device.The techs at Lexar seemed very aware of this issue when I used their online support.The seemed, at first, defensive. Later they were more reasonable.The package was misleading to me. I was led to believe that this is a fully compatable product. Especially since Lexar's Multi-Card Reader does work on all of my Macs' USB ports.Yuk. This is supposed to be a convenience product! I should not have to crawl on my hands and knees to use it."
4,Is the Mail in Rebate scheme a fraud?,"The product works fine for simple data transfer purposes. But my problem is with their customer disservice department. I have been running from pillar to post to get mail-in rebate from the company - no luck.The rebate form asked for the ORIGINAL 12 digit UPC barcode. When I sent this in, after about a month, I got a card asking for a PHOTOCOPY of the 12 digit UPC barcode. I sent this in and now they want the ORIGINAL again.I remember reading other customers complaining in this forum about this company's attitude towards customers. Somebody should call their bluff - I plan to lodge a complaint with the BBB for starters."
2,"Works fine, but only for a little while","I, along with three other people I know, bought this drive a few months ago when it was on sale at a local store. None of the four drives have lasted more than 4 months (mine was the last to die, yesterday). I would recommend you stay away from Lexar flash drives--there's a reason why they are comparitively inexpensive."
1,Beware!!!!,"I have had a Lxar Jump Drive for only about 3 weeks and it has stopped working...totally....no warning, nothing.My entire secure information is now lost, accounts, passwords, source code,everything.Not reliable enough for me to ever purchase again. I can't afford to loss everything again.Sorry. Once bitten....forget it. When it comes to data storage I only give a device one chance."
1,Lexar Jump Drive Problems,"I bought one of the 256 mg drives only three months ago and already it has broken. It cannot be read by either a PC or on a MAC.I asked the company for a replacement but they want the original drive back (with all my personal information on it) before they will replace it. THIS IS A PROBLEM. Who wants to send their personal data to a bunch of strangers? I bought this to use as a backup to my other drives, and to transport information. If I have to back up my back up then that is not gonna work.I would recommend avoiding this company's products and go with one of the other brands, like the intelligent stick.All they had to do was replace my device and I would have then destroyed the origingal (which doesn't work) and returned it to them. They will not allow that so...I'm not buying another one from them.MS"
3,Mac issues 5 months into usage,"It's been a workdog for me for 5 months, and worked great. Then one fine day decided to stop working on Mac systems. Definitely would think twice next time about buying similar products."
1,Recommend buying another brand ...,One month after I purchased this product it broke. Asked Lexar to replace it and they basically ignored me. Buy another brand.
3,troubles trying to restore the equipment,"I have been facing problems trying to restore the equipment. I suppose one user unplugged it without closing the files. Does any one knows how to restore/reset the equipment?I already tried to format it to ntfs as per the other's review without success, the system replys telling that Raw drives could not be formated...?????If someone knows the solution, please advise me.arnoldosoto@cantv.net"
2,It doesn't have a write protect switch!,"Another reviewer says this model has a write protect switch. Where the write protect switch is on his model, mine just has a small hole. I suspect that maybe some early models had a write protect switch, but the one I got today definitely does not. (Lexar never claims this model has a write protect switch).The small whole exposes the circuit board, allowing dust, pocket lint, liquid, etc., inside. (At least in principal....) This is very annoying...I'd really like to have a write protect switch, and bought this because I thought that it had one.Otherwise it's nice so far. I echo other reviewers' that the clip on the cover seems superfulous. The drive is also a little large to be on a keychain. It is nice that the keychain is attached to the base of the drive though. This means you can't easily disconnect it from your keychain, but also means that it will be harder to lose."
2,Liked it while it lasted,"I received it for Christmas and six months later, it's dead. The problems began intermittantly: I would insert it into the USB slot and it would be recognized as a removable drive, but when I tried to access it, Windows would say that the drive wasn't formatted. Usually, after reseating the drive in the USB port a few times, it would work but now it has quite working completely. Finally, I attempted to reformat the drive and Windows said that the drive couldn't be formatted.Note: I did keep the drive on my keychain so it received a fair amount of wear.Other problems I've noticed:Fairly slow (I did not reformat to NTFS as others suggested)It definately requires a powered USB slotI've lost the cap countless times. It needs to be secured to the body.The key loop is about to break, due to wear. It needs a heavier construction."
2,for the non-traveler,"As a fairly frequent business traveler (about 1 trip/month), I got this book hoping to pick up some helpful hints to make travel a little easier. I was disappointed in the book. It seems to be aimed at those at a very junior level who need every detail spelled out (""tell your colleagues you'll be out of the office""), or who have never made a business trip before (some tips seemed aimed at people who have never been on a plane before). For someone just starting in the business world or someone starting an entry level job that requires travel, it may be useful- experienced travelers can skip it."
2,"Some cool ideas, but no coehesion","Definitely dark and a bit surrealistic. The setting is very harsh (and I like that) but it seemed to me more like a string of events with no characters - all extras. I didn't care about the characters and they didn't care about themselves. There was no interaction. These ideas put together by someone like Iain Banks would be absolutely fabulous, but by himself it needs work."
5,Superbikes and Supermodels,"An exclusive up close look at all the top factory bikes of the AMA National and SBK World Superbike Championships together with the beautiful SBK FastDates.com models. The girls include Penthouse Pet of the Year Zdenka and the top factory superbikes from Ducati, Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, Aprilia and Benelli, including Troy Bayless' World Championship winning Ducati 998F and Kurtis Roberts' Formula Extreame winning Honda CBR926RR. Let's race!"
3,Works Well,"D-Pad on one of the controllers didn't work, otherwise, it was in good condition.This is great for PS2 games with multiplayer capability."
4,Highly Recommended,"I have 2 of these remotes, and I'm now looking for a third. My first one is still going strong after nearly 4 years of daily use. I've been able to program everything but my stereo to work with it - it will only power off with it. It will work with all my TVs, VCRs and DVD players. One DVD player will even allow it to open and close the disc tray. Another DVD player I can't turn on or off with the remote, but can do everything else with. Another DVD player I can't do disc select since that one has 7 disks. I can't do all the timer/menu programming on 2 of the 3 VCRs. It allows me to eject VHS tapes on 2 of the 3 VCRs. But after all these years, I have no complaints, and no regrets. It's first starting to wear out now and getting tempermental. The numbers are fading, but considering it cost me $10 four years ago new... I wish I could get another one for that price new."
3,"A great starter's guide, but.....","I have previously used Cakewalk software (briefly) as well as Sonar, and I have a decent knowledge of how to do most of the basic tasks, as well as some tricks and effects and things. That being said, this book really hasn't added that much to what I knew already, although it serves me well as a reference for a lot of things. It also has some good ways of reducing various problems from the mix. But if you already kind of know your stuff and you're looking to get your hands dirtier, get something a little more advanced."
4,"Yes, buy it, but read on...","I have the vinyl not the cd, but whatever. You really have to own this for Cum On Feel the Noize and Skweeze Me Pleeze Me, only because those are probably Slade's most amazing songs ever, and still send chills down my spine. So you know, I consider the melodic, catchy, hyper rock n' roll Slade to be best, which was decidedly innovative and timeless, while other material sounds like cliched 70's nausea. If you are searching further for the magic that fills the two aforementioned songs, I would recommend ""Old New Borrowed and Blue"" (under a different name in some English releases - ""Clap your Hands Stomp Your Feet,"" I think?). ""Slayed?"" is fine for a few songs, but again, it depends what you're after: glammy, anthemic rock n roll, or slow stoner numbers that show their age. ""In Flame"" is pretty good too."
4,Slade Made,"The second album I owned, after bequeathing ""Diamond Dogs"" from my brother. I was 11(!), and shared the aural avalanche with good buddies Jim Plummer, Mike Contestabile, and others when I brought the album into school for music class!. Missing on the import (but included on the American release) is ""My Friend Stan"" (great) and ""My Town"". For loud glitter rock of the era, this is definitive. A true and cherishable time capsule..."
3,A Great Murder Story?,"The back cover of this book says that Emily Stanton is charged with murder and stands trial in one of the most startling cases ever. That may be true, but the murder doesn't come until page 364 of a 453 page book!Emily got on my nerves. She is mostly spineless, naive beyond belief, and easily manipulated. She doesn't seem to learn anything from her mistakes. It's hard to side with her.However I did enjoy the story of New York in the '20's and '30's that was interwoven with Emily's story. It really gave me a feeling of the flavor of those times."
3,"Predictable, but kept my interest.","Lullaby and Good Night was a good story, but predictable. The reader knew up front that Emily would not come out ahead until the end. Also, Emily was very frustrating because she was so naive--unrealistically naive. Despite these frustrations with the book, I really enjoyed the description of New York City in the late 20's as well as the descriptions of the characters. The book kept my attention all the way to the end."
1,the seller said it was new but,the seller said it was new but already had enough use of diagnostic equipment for that reason does not work for all. It is therefore advisable to settle themselves before buying though they say that is new
3,NOT thrilled,"I purchased this disc in May 2004.I has a VHS copy -taken from pay TV. While the DVD was a bit cleare/less grainy ,the video was 1.33:1 ,not 1.85:1 as advertised;also the sound was MONO ,not Dolby Surround as advertised. A good film but a technically inferior disc.Edd.iegolden@shaw.ca"
3,"Wonderful film, but...","The film is really wonderful as the others wrote. But this DVD is really disappointing. It doesn't have any supplement like a director's commentary. It doesn't have any subtitles. (I'm not from a English speaking country and it was really hard to understand the old English accent.) Moreover, it's not widescreen.4 stars for the film, no star for this DVD. Really disappointing."
5,Incredible,"About five years ago, a former roomate rented this film one night. Having nothing better to do, I decided to watch it with him. Needless to say, this movie appealed to both my sense of fantasy and the medieval. The visuals were stunning, the actors were absolutely wonderful getting even the accents of the time correct. But what struck me the most was the soundtrack for the movie. As for the movie, if you haven't seen it, do so NOW. It will be time well spent."
3,A lost classic!,The USA release of this DVD costs upwards of $100.00... So this version is a suitable alternative... although the image quality is not the best... it's well worth the price.This is the story of a boy in small village surrounded by the black plague... he has a vision that the villagers should tunnel through the earth to escape the plague... which they do... and emerge on the other side of the globe... in 20th century New Zealand...beautifully shot...
1,What exactly were the other reviewers smoking?,"I can appreciate a film that is more art than entertainment. Heck, I have watched ""Citizen Kane"" multiple times, which alone ought to qualify me for a medal. But this movie was painful to watch. I kept waiting, hoping, praying for it to get better with the thought: ""No movie can really be this bad..."" constantly running through my mind. Sadly, I was mistaken. This film was officially placed on my ""Top Ten Worst Films"" list.I might someday purchase a used version to give as an excellent gag gift however..."
2,Large and flexable,I have to admit that this is not as handy as I hoped. It is big and clumsy and it's a little too flexable.
3,"Great Tool, But Not Fully Supported","The Garmin-supported Motionbased website stated that the foot pod isn't currently supported, but will be by the end of the year. I would've held off buying this if I knew that at the time of purchase."
1,garmin indoor foot pod accessory,Jury is still out on my foot pod as i haven't been able to get it to sync up with my forerunner 305 (with the latest s/w load) yet. Will need to contact support line for assistance.
5,** Great accessory for Forerunner 305 **,"I bought the footpod so I can train on the treadmill in winter using my 305 and still be able to upload my speed and distance data to the PC and web. It works great. The 305 recognizes when the footpod is on, and asks you if you want to turn off the GPS. As far as accuracy goes, it does not display the same level of accuracy across a range of different running speeds. So if you walk 2 miles (8 laps) and then run 2 miles (8 laps), you would not get the same distance readings for the two activities. But it's accurate enough for me, to give it a 5-star rating. I have not seen a bad product from Garmin yet."
3,Nice little food pod,"The foot pod seems to be accurate and its very easy to sync to your 305, however, I'm not super happy how it laces up on your running shoes. I suppose it's difficult to design something like this, but they should have angled the holes for the laces differently."
2,"Works good, needs batteries often and a pain to install","Often is not exactly how I would put it. How about, ""More often than I would have thought"". I need to change about once every 4 months. The battery issue is much less annoying than the fact that I have to unlace my shoes to ""install"" and ""uninstall"" the foot pod. This is a pain anytime that I want to use a different pair of shoes on the treadmill. The unit is also quite big for what it is, which is less annoying than I would have first thought. The weight has not been an issue, and I hardly even notice it is there while I am running. Overall, just an acceptable design."
4,Now I can run indoors with my Garmin,"A very nice add-on to the Garmin Forerunner 305. Out of the box it is about .06/mile off (short) but I haven't done the calibration yet. It should be spot-on after that adjustment. I also like the cadence feature when outdoors so I can maintain my pace.It's a tad big for my taste but doesn't interfere with my running or gait and it doesn't weigh much at all. The size is probably mostly due tho the AAA battery it uses. If they'd use a watch battery instead, they could make it smaller...just a suggestion Garmin.It's worth the money."
4,Work well,Works really well. Easy to set-up and is very accurate. Only negative is that it is a little big.
2,works great but battery access terrible,I like this pod for running/walking but will not work on a stationary bike also biggest complaint is getting to the battery I have striped out 2 pods already getting the cap to release; they need an improvement. also to big.
4,Forerunner Foot Pod,The item was delivered promptly and preforms as described. The only downside I have for it is it would be nice if there was a quick way to get the pod off of my shoe when I don't need it. I switch back and forth between running indoors and out so I don't need it constantly on my shoe. But other than that it is sturdy and works right out of the box. I would by another when the time comes.
4,So far so good...,"... I've only had to use it a couple of times for my bike, we'll see after this winter ..."
4,The Charge Master,"Charges quickly and I do like it's compact size.With 3 riding mowers, 2 jet skis, 1 boat, and5 cars, this charger is more than handy. Priceis more than reasonable as well........"
5,Great item,"Do not bee fooled by the size of this charger, it a tiny little piece of a monster, it's easy to operate, I thinks it's clamps were made by a person who has used a charger before and knows that not all battery poles are the same."
3,"Good unit, but slow.","Purchase this unit because my car battery is not recharging correctly. After going through numerous mechanic and the Acura dealership, found out the best solution is just to get a battery charger and charge my battery every 2 or so weeks.Here are the Pros and Cons for this unit.Pro:- Small, Portable, definitely not a piece of equipment that will take up space in your garage.- Does not overheat, I've used it for close to 12 hours, the unit is just warm, not even hot.- Come with all the connectors you need, including charging through the cigarette lighter, does not work for my car though.Con:- Since it is only 3 AMP, takes quite awhile to recharge a car battery. Note that my car battery is not drained, just low. From low to fully charge took me 12 hours.I was thinking about other charge unit with higher AMP, however, being an engineer myself, the last thing I want is the charger or battery overheating and cause a fire in my house."
2,Not even a placebo effect.,"It did nothing for me. Absolutely nothing, tried it for around 4 weeks, no side effects though.I gave it to my mum, she didn't report any interesting effects so far.I'm giving it two stars because I did some research on it before buying and I do believe it might work for some people, and personal experience doesn't really count with medical treatments, but that's why you have lots of reviewers for!"
3,"Good, but could have been better","The book is comprehensive in its overview of the features, but lacking in feature applications. There could have been more and better examples of how to apply Sound Forge in daily use, lists of settings for different applications, and explanations for why some settings might work better than others. I definitely felt like I needed more after completing the book."
3,I REALIZE THAT....,"AFTER WATCHING THIS MOVIE FOUR TIMES IN A ROW, I NOTICED THAT EVERYTHING IS GREAT; EXCEPT FOR DOLORES HEREDIA'S PERFORMANCE.IT ST NKS. THE MOVIE DESERVED A BETTER ACTRESS.THE MUSIC IS OUTSTANDING!!!"
4,"Very good, a little too long","Great visuals, amusing story. Should be a little shorter IMO. Would see again."
1,Kindle Version is Not The Same!!!,FYI The kindle version of this book has different stories than the printed version of this book. It is supposed to have:The Queen of SpadesThe Tales of the Late P. BelkinAn Amateur Peasant GirlThe ShotThe SnowstormThe PostmasterThe Coffin-MakerInstead the kindle version has:The Negro of Peter the GreatDubrovskyThe Queen of SpadesThe Captain's DaughterDon't get the kindle version if you actually want t he same stories as the paperback.
3,Quirky and Amusing,"Knudson's not your typical YA novelist. She has a sly sense of humor that many other authors in this genre lack, and that definitely gives her a leg up on the competition.For instance in the present book, Zan Hagen, all around sports nut, turns her nerdish best friend Arthur into a world class power lifter able to best all the confirmed jocks at their school.The quirky characters and situations alleviate the threat of predictability. One cannot help but like these young people for the zealousness and even joy in pursuing their goals.It's a nice message for folks in similar situations."
5,"Calvin and Hobbes, Zits and now Shermans Lagoon...","I bought one collection to try, then wound up purchasing the entire published collection of Sherman Lagoon books for my 13 year old son who absolutely loves them. The setting is the ocean world, but all that transpires reflects the ""real"" world above. The humor is insightful, a bit cynical and the characters colorful. We're waiting for more...."
5,Perfect for the classroom,"This book is perfect for the classroom and professors who are interested in teaching Latin, Cicero in particular, at the college level. The book contains relevant information, vital to the understanding of Cicero and his writing style as well a running list of vocabulary. Students learn easily from this book and complete the course with a much better understanding of Latin and Cicero. This book is particularly good for those students who wish to pursue a career in the field of classics or just enhance their knowledge of Latin. Buy this book!!"
4,I had to return due to my error.,"Looked great and easy to install. I unfortunately, did not pay enough attention and ordered the wrong size. All my fault."
3,Very Basic,"If you don't know ANYTHING about SQL/Analysis Server and need to learn about its implementation of data mining, you'll enjoy this book. In addition to data mining there's a fair amount of discussion on DSO, DTS, data warehousing, etc. (Of course, if don't anything about these technologies jumping into Analysis Server's implementation of data mining might be a bit premature.)But, if you are familiar with Analysis Server and data warehousing and want to learn a little data mining, then there's about a hundred pages of good reading. Seidman covers the basics of the two data mining technologies Microsoft implemented - decision trees & clustering.Finally, be prepared for some serious grunt work if you like to ""read and code"". The author does not include any helpful downloads to get going quickly."
2,"a seminar paper, not a book",This book just likes an academic seminar paper. It's hard to understand. It's not a practical book for study data mining.
4,good product,"Good product, but really bad instructions. Leatherman tools are really good, but for the money, one would think they'd provide better ""how to"" instructions -- like how do you attach the belt clip (I finally figured it out). What are the side tabs on the case for? I still dont have a clue.Oh well"
2,not for hiking but great for camping were hiking is not invloved,this product is built tough for sure. . . . but do not take it on long hiking trips because it is heavy and bulky. Other than that the tool is great
3,This is definitely no childs toy...,"It is a great tool to have, but not carry around; quit heavy for carrying around on a daily basis, especially if you do not work in an industry where such a product sees a lot of use. Do your research and make sure you look at the weight of the product; no fun when product is (slightly) stretching the belt holding up your pants."
5,Leatherman is the standard,"This is my first Leatherman tool, I had always bought the cheaper brands before hand, thinking a multi-tool is a multi-tool, but this Leatherman has changed my mind. It is definately the multi-tool to which all others should be compared to. Everything is easily accessed, and is made to last a lifetime, I can even buy add ons such as extra bits for the screwdriver. I definately recommend Leatherman multi-tools, you can't go wrong."
2,Too damned big.,If you have large hairy hands that drag on the ground and you watch a lot of football then this is probably for you. Otherwise it's just too damned large and heavy for practical use.
4,good tool,nice tool it serves my requirements it is handy and light weight but you need to protect your hands when using it because of the sharp edges when it is open as a pliers
3,Love the tool but a little disappointed in quality.,"I love this tool, and think it's my favorite as well as most carried. The weight is a bit on the heavy side, but a small price to pay for the larger blades and stronger pliers. The tool is larger then my Wave, however nothing ridiculous. Although I'm sure the QC will not take away from the general use of the tool. I was disappointed with the Surge compared to the Wave. Everything in comparison to the Wave seemed less smooth both in operation and overall finish.Although the Surge is not as well made as older Leathermans such as the Supertool, Wave, etc., it will still get the job done with ease. I prefer to carry my Surge with the extra bit kit."
2,Sharp edges,"This tool is heavy duty and is designed well, but the sharp edges on the handle could cut your hand. I have several victorinox products, and their fit and finish is much better. The Surge I got also had loose sissors just like another reviewer. For a tool that lists for $93, this is unbelievable."
5,Great tool,"I bought the Letherman Surge after it was recommended to me by a friend. After having it for a few weeks I found that it can do almost anything and I haven't had any problems at all with it, although be warned it is kinda heavy and takes a little getting used to. I do recommend getting the bit extension though cause the stock bit holder is too short to get into tight areas."
4,Gets it Done....,I had to give up my original Leatherman at the airport recently. I had left it in a bag and did not even realize it. When I replaced it with this newer version I was not disappointed.
4,Its a nice tool with good quality,"Its a nice tool with good quality, should try using it in different weather conditions and check it out about the quality.Though it weighs a bit heavy it does its job perfectly and I found it veryful !As usual Amazon shipped it perfectly on time :)"
4,Leatherman 830160 Surge Pocket Multitool with Leather Sheath (Purchased on 12/01/2008),"It is an excellent product, you will do what do you want with this tool, It has different tool that is very usable. I recommend this tool because its quality is unsurpassable, it is very resistant and easy to use. Its sheath is good and resistible."
2,had to be fixed,"This item was purchased as a gift to my dear uncle who lives outside US. I took it to him this summer. He was very excited about this instrument at first. Unfortunately, one part would not open as it was supposed to. Luckily, my uncle is quite a handyman and has a collection of fine instruments at home. He was able to get it fixed! Or he is saying he fixed it so that I don't get upset (I hope not!). This is a major disappointment. As you see, returning or replacing the item wasn't really an option. Was it just really bad luck? I expected good and reliable quality from Leatherman."
4,powerful tool,"I am now a proud owner of leatherman tools.I've bought a surge several weeks ago.(The first time I opened the package I noticed it's appearance was not the same as that on leatherman's webset.Does leatherman usually change their product's configuration?)when I opened the pliers,the operation was smooth.The wire cutters can cut off thick iron wires easily.It's not only rugged but also flexible.Thank you leatherman for producing such an awesome multi tool!"
4,Excellent multi tool- but heavy,"All in all a great multi tool! I have used a few different models and this one is the best so far. Very functional, accessible, and user friendly. Blades keep an edge and are very sharp. Plyers are great. The tools on it are very good and some of the best scissors I have seen on a multi tool. One draw back. This thing is heavy. Unusually heavy for a multitool."
4,little stiff out of the box,"just recieved my leatherman surge in the mail the other day and i couldnt be happier with it. it has everything i need on it and more. the only problem i ran into was it was a little stiff to open and close. i called the leatherman company about it and the said they are made that way to last longer and recommended i go buy some lubricant. they recommended tri flow superior lubricant and with using that and constant opening and closing it, it has loosened up some. all in all great tool and i plan on using it for years."
5,Awesome!,"I purchased this item to replace my WAVE which was misplaced. As a homeowner I am lost without this on the weekends, it is always handy for making quick repairs without fumbling through my toolbox for pliers, knife, screwdriver, etc. This along with the driver set is only needing a hammer to make it a complete toolbox on your belt. I recommend this tool for everyone."
2,Leatherman Surge Breaks 2 months after purchase,"This product looks great but can't stand up to mild use. The lock release for the bottle opener and other tools broke after only two months of very light use. I am sending it back for repair under the 25 year limited warranty, but would NOT buy this product again and only hope it lasts longer than two months after warranty service return or replacement of the item."
5,Just right for Papa Bear!,"I read these reviews after ordering this as a pro deal from the manufacturer. I was a little scared after I read some of them.Now that it arrived and I have had it in my hand all my worries are gone.It fits my hands just right. It feels like a solid and bomber tool. I love the easy blade access.Now, in the case it seems about cell phone sized. So, on a belt it does feel big. I don't really mind though. The case would get a 4 or so and the gadget would get a 5 so really this should be a 4 and a half.Now, as you read that this is just right for my hand, bear in mind that I am 6'2"" and 250 lbs. This may feel big to average people. To me though, just right."
4,Leatherman,I really like this knife except that it is a little bit bigger than I thought it was and a little bulkier than I expected.But other than that I like it.
4,Leatherman Surge Multitool,"The leatherman surge pocket multitool is an excellent item to have when working with electronic equipment, boxes, small tubing and connectors. The nylon sheath easly slides onto one's belt for convient storage and access. The interchangeable tools and bits are a great addition to this item."
5,love it,"I bought this surge and i have used it every day since buying it. i love it! i have used this and the wave wich is still a great knife but i like the bigger size of the surge its not to bulky but big enough when it needs to be. if you use a multi tool alot i'd go for this one if you use it not as often or just have one for ""just in case"" i'd go with the wave."
5,Great Handy Tool,"It's just so great to have a multi-tool on my belt that I can use for just about anything, anytime the need comes up without having to run out to the garage and search for the tool I need."
3,Weak Pliers,"I use my multi-tool several times per day. Over the years, I have busted multi-tools manufactured by Gerber and Leatherman. Three months ago a coworker convinced me to by a Surge because it was made in America. Now, three months later I am returning it because the pliers snapped in half. I wish I had bought another Swiss-tool by Victorinox instead. i have lost a Swiss-tool before, but have never broken one, no matter how hard I use them.The Surge has some good features, but for the price it shouldn't break after three months. My current Victorinox is 6 years old and is still going strong."
3,"Lots of tools, but bigger than I would like","I had an old Leatherman II that I really liked but I was forced to give it up at an airport (I wasn't trying to sneak it in, I forgot it was in that bag). I looked around at some different tools for various brands, but I kept coming back to the Leathermans. The Surge was on sale and looked like it had everything I needed so I ordered it.I don't use a Leatherman often, but I like to have it around when camping or on a motorcycle ride or road trip. This one is a little bigger than like but it does have a lot of tools. I use the screw drivers most, the eyeglass on is nice, and it is nice to have the normal blade and scissors on the outside so you don't have to open it up every time.I it a good tool, but maybe a little big and hefty to carry on your hip on a long hike or something."
4,Chistmas gift,I can't write a review on how awesome this is yet because it's a gift for my husband. What I can write about is how fast this was delivered. I am always extra satisfied when what I order is shipped out and arrives as promised. I'm certain the leatherman will be a huge hit.
3,High expectation for the pliers is not fully met,"This Surge multi-tool is an excellent, high-quality tool. However, I am going to be very harsh in this review and take off two stars because the pliers are not ""spring-loaded"" (or whatever you call it). This is the main tool and I had very high expectation for it.I would still recommend the multi-tool, though. For all the Leatherman fans out there, please feel free to yell at me for this critical review, but I stand by my opinion."
1,leatherman surge review,"i have owned and used many leatherman tools and this SURGE falls well below in craftsmanship of manufacturing. it certainly has all the bells and whistles but is just poorly put together.if i hadn't completely destroyed the packaging it came in when i opened it, i would have immediately returned it"
5,Absolutely the best.,"Don't bother buying a knock-off. There's nothing like a Leatherman tool. Their guarantee is rock solid- if anything goes wrong, they have your back- no questions asked."
5,raddness,its heavy but its be best multi tool that they make. and they are the best in the industry.the quality is through the roof
5,This album is real,This album was put together good. The tight beats by Big Hollis and the tight raps by young fierce and the perfessional producing by luni-corleone. It's like a good recipe with the write ingredients. If you like under-ground rap you need to hear this album. THIS ALBUM IS REAL!!! WE NEED MORE REAL PEOPLE LIKE THIS IN DA GAME SO THE REAL CAN STAY TRUE AND ALIVE!!!ARDIVILLIDenver CO. Da mile High!!
3,he sounds a little like tech n9ne...,"but the album is still decent at best. it has good guest artists with the likes of coleone, quinn, guce, and so on, but im not feelin it. the only reason i didnt give this a 1 rating is becuz of the guest stars and the tight beats from hollis. but unfortunately, i bought the album a while back and havent listened to it since just recently, so now that i know i dont like it, i gotta get rid of it. oh well."
2,"Concentrate, really?","I purchased this to add to my washer tank when the weather got really really cold and the tank froze up (the folks that did the last top-off apparently didn't use cold weather fluid). After reading the directions, however, this stuff appears to have the same properties as standard cold-weather washer fluid. In fact, it says to use it at full concentration in extreme cold conditions. Adding it to a frozen solid tank did get things moving again, but so did regular -20F washer fluid (which I can get anywhere at a fraction the cost)."
4,"Great bargain, looks decent and reusable.",They were great for the type of event I used them for. I purchased inexpensive trays to be used for outdoors.
1,Terrible Experience,"I paid extra for these items to arrive in time for a dinner party; they arrived two days after the party. When they arrived, they were full of scratches and they look very cheap. Horrible experience."
2,Dollar Store Quality,"Received these trays quickly from Onesource. Very disappointed as they all had indentation like lines. They are very thin almost like a frozen pie plate, I would expect to find these items at the dollar store. Never received a reply for a return from the seller. They are not worth $25.00."
5,Looks great and durable,"I had been looking for a metal platter to use specifically for cooking on the grill. My last metal tray got ruined after just one use when the marinade I used discolored the metal finish. I considered glass or ceramic, but too heavy. Plastic and acrylic have the potential to melt. I also needed something large enough to accomodate 12"" skewers. The large tray is perfect for skewers coming off the grill. The trays are solid but light weight. The 2 smaller trays are perfect for cooking small amounts of food. They look great so can be used for multiple purposes. Stainless steel is the way to go. Great value."
5,Beautiful Platters,"I love this stainless steel platter set. In fact, I have brought 2 sets. The quality is wonderful, well worth the money for these products. I have also brought other products from this seller too. I look forward in buying again when I plan a retirement party for my family member. Excellent and Superb services. AAC"
2,"NEW, Stainless Steel Serving Platter Set, Serving Tray Set, Oval-Shape, Catering Party Tray, Hors d'oeuvres Tray, Horderve Tray,","Trays are very nice, the only problem is fingerprints, no matter where you pick them up from or how many times you wipe them."
5,Excellent Pasta Machine,I like this pasta machine and think its a good buy. I had bought the exact same machine 12 years ago and it finally broke (my fault). I had such good luck with it I decided to buy the same model again. The key to using this machine is getting the flour mixture right. My suggestion is to take your time adding the liquid as the instructions state and your pasta comes out perfect each time. I tried other cheaper brands in the past before buying my first Lello 12 years ago and have learned you get what you pay for when it comes to pasta machines.
4,Pasta Possible,"Great pasta machine that does the work for you. It kneads and pushes the pasta through different sized discs, depending on the shape desired. Two major drawbacks, though. It is very heavy, so make sure you store it in an easily accessible place, and it is also time consuming to clean. I suggest you use it several times in a row to familiarize yourself wth all the working parts. Then you won't feel overwhelmed each time you drag it out."
1,Had to return the item,"Not a good product for a new pasta maker. I followed the directions to the letter and it was not allowing the pasta to flow out to make the noodles correctly. Again, could have been me, but if you are new to homemade pasta, this is a horrible machine. It also stopped working on me during the first use so I returned it. I ordered one of the hand crank machines with a motor on it, which I am sure will be much easier and full proof than this machine. Also, the instructions tell you that the machine could stop working if you get any flour down in past a certain part -- now tell me how you are suppose to keep flour that gets in any crevice possible out of the area where the dough is suppose to flow out of the machine? Too risky for me."
5,Works just like it says it will,"I checked out several brands before deciding on this one. I followed the directions exactly, and the pasta came out perfect. it makes up to 3 pounds of pasta each time.That's a lot of pasta. But, you can freeze the leftover that you don't need right now. the noodles are not sticky and they cook fast. the fettucine cooked in 3 minutes after water boiled. I have no regrets."
2,"Probably would work for lighter, basic pastas","I have been using an old CTC pasta machine that is on it's last legs. I liked that I could make a hearty, all egg, semolina flour pasta with the CTC. The Lello requires bleached flour at all times, either 100% or at least partially with semolina or other flours. Plus, all flour must be sifted and weighed. As an experienced pasta machine operator, I am familiar with the different and certain consistencies that seem to work best. The Lello seems to require a more moist yet lighter dough mix, with smaller coagulations. I had a difficult time getting the mix to fall into the 2nd stage auger for extrusion. While I feel that the Lello may make decent lighter and basic pastas, it failed at making the heartier, all egg, semolina pasta that I enjoy."
3,Great Homemade pasta with little effort,I ordered this to replace a pasta machine I have had for years. It is very similar and works great.
3,Lello 2730 Pasta Machine,"The finished product was very good. It is very important to weigh the flour as opposed to using a measuring cup. It seemed to have a couple more steps then the machine I had used previously, but the end results were very good. I have not had this machine very long and have not tried all the different cutters, but I do not expect any problems as long as I follow the directions."
1,piece of junk,"save your money. do not buy this product !!! takes 15 min to make a pound of pasta. very slow. to extrude pasta, you have to remove a small plastic divider, after mixing dough. when removed there is a opening for dough to come out of all over the counter !!!"
2,I don't know what this is good for.,"This spoon (and accompanying spatula, etc.) is so BIG! It would be great for stirring a pot of chili for 20, but it's just too big and awkward for regular use. I'm sorry I bought it -- I would have been smarter just to go to Target or wherever for my kitchenware."
3,Rehash,"While the CD is fine, it is a UN-new work as it uses material from previous releases. I guess it is good to put the string together for workouts and such. As long as you like Steamroller of the past, it works well. Those that put CD material on an MP3, it less worth obtaining it. I like it but was not aware that it contained ""old goodies""."
3,Expected More,"Based on the reviews, I expected more. If you want a checklist of the most rudimentary things a sales consultant or S.E. should know - this is a good source. While I doubt anyone could argue with any of the things the authors say, most of what they say is so obvious and non-debatable that the question is - was it worth saying?"
4,Worth reading,"I have been a sales engineer (SE) for a major telecom equipment vendor selling to a billion dollar customer for about five years. I spent fifteen plus years deep within the development lab never really even seeing a customer let alone selling successfully to one. This book does a good job covering all the bases for SEs. I wish I had read it in the beginning of my career as an SE, and would recommend it to anyone who is an SE or considering becoming one. Even for very seasoned SEs, there are techniques in effectively speaking to the customer that would likely make the book well worth reviewing."
1,Not for Salespeople,"As a seasoned sales professional coming from a lightly technical background, I had hoped that this book (although targeted to technical folks in a light selling capacity) would provide some insight divergent from a traditional industry. As such, it completely missed the mark. Indeed, I am not sure that it would be well worth it for its intended audience. It is not at all useful in 'making' the technical sale in the least. However, it might serve a purpose for engineers and other technical types in understanding the business component of their respective industry. With some modification to the text, I would retitle the book, 'Why do sales and business people do that?'."
2,This book it not for everyone.,"I loved the Ways of the Superior Man and Dear Lover. This book's characters, stories, and lessons were over the top, and pushed the envelope too far for me. While compelling and erotic, the lessons were somewhat lost on me."
1,fiction,"This self absorbed story was not a great read. I found the writing choppy and uninteresting and the gist of the book did not translate well into the human experience. Not insightful and not translatable to the real human experience. A story of the self absorption and denial of what in reality is an addiction process normalized. This book even deceptively tries to come off as ""spiritual"" guidance. All around this book is a bore of a read."
5,Jacob's Magic Box Discovery Series,Wow! My 2 year-old LOVES these books and we think they are wonderful! This is really a cute and creative concept. Jacob is a darling little boy and his grandma takes ordinary things out of the magic box and makes them exciting. These books are favorites and we read them a lot every week at our house. My daughter is always ready to hear her magic box stories. The books keep her interest and she never tires of them. The words are interesting for her and the pictures are adorable. I would recommend these books to anyone looking for an entertaining way to teach young children.
1,Video editing-no way,"i searched many programs, looking for a simple way to capture my own video from vcr, camera or t.v. and then record it back to the vcr or cd. This isn't the program. I searched the manual (very nice) but it doesn't enabale you to record back to your vcr----so I am returning it."
5,What I've Been Looking For,"After my Oxo spinner broke (and it's the second Oxo item of mine that has broken so I'm kind of put off by them now) I was looking for a spinner that wasn't going to break. The choices out there are mainly the Oxo and the Zyliss. My problem with the Zyliss is that if the cord doesn't break, pulling it is bound to make the top come off sooner or later. I just wanted a handle to crank. I came here to Amazon and found the Pedrini and this Guzzini. The Pedrini had disappointing reviews (the most common theme being gear slippage) so I took a chance on the Guzzini (no reviews here but I did some Googling that gave me confidence). For starters, this salad spinner is gorgeous. Salad spinners are never going to be works of art but they can have a little style and this one does. Does a great job of spinning with no gear slippage. That's pretty much what you want, right? Dries the salad and looks great. What more could you ask for in a salad spinner?"
1,Ships in 12 day my butt!!!!,"I have no complaints about the DVDs... I have a complaint about Amazon! I ordered this set in August. The people at Amazon told me it would ship in 12 days at the latest. They've now bumped up the time to sometime this month! I have received all my other orders I paid for at the same time as the DVD set, but have I seen my ""Dr. Who"" set yet? The answer: NO!You're better off buying from someone that is not Amazon LLC, or else you'll be waiting a while like I am."
5,aaaahhhh the good ole days,"I really miss billie p. Not to take anything away from the new chicks, but she was great the first two seasons."
1,It's been 5 years and the price has gone UP?,This used to sell for $78 on Amazon. Why is it suddenly $122?This is a 5 star series...but 1 star because of the price.I love the series but coupled with the fact that this show goes for $20 a season (new) in the UK I find it hard to justify this excessive price for 13 episodes per season.It's not even blu-ray.
5,Great comparison of the two Doctors,"With all the deserved hoopla over David Tennant as the 10th Doctor, people forget that when Dr. Who reemerged with Chris Eccleston as the 9th Doctor there was an equal amount of hoopla. Now he's overlooked. So buying these two years together, year one with Eccleston and year two with Tennant, bound together with Rose as the companion offer a good comparison. I never want to forget Eccleston's perormance. Had he continued, the series would have been every bit as good, albeit in a different direction. He is the least quirky, or most ""normal"" of all the Doctors I am familiar with and that leant a level of believability to the character. He's almost the ""superhero space alien next door"". Kind, caring, and an ironic sense of humor, somewhat distant and mysterious with none of Tennant's manic qualities"
5,Doctor Who rocks,"I really love the new series, they are doing a fantastic job with it all. I can hardly wait for season 4. If you have never seen Doctor Who, I would suggest you do so, this also means that if you have the chance, watch the old shows too.James"
2,"Great show, defective dvds","I absolutly love Doctor Who, and think it's a great show, but when I bought this set, I recieved defective dvds, which I then returned only to recieve another set of defective dvds, and now I'm still waiting on a refund. Therefore, you may want to consider buying this on iTunes, unless you really want the special features and the Christmas episode, which is not currently on iTunes. Either way, I would recomend buying it from somewhere, it's fantastic."
1,Mistaken identity,Another misdirection: this 'Jim Dodge' should be illegal: this is vanity publishing at its absolute worst. This is NOT a book by the poet of the same name.
5,Best Nokia yet,"I have used Nokia phones for 11 years: 2100, 6100, 5100, 6200. I was nervous about this one having read the 6210 reviews, but all my concerns were unfounded.For those who complain about low volume through the earpiece, try setting the ""automatic volume control"" to on. With this option set, earpiece volume is more than loud enough."
3,"A good phone...nothing less, nothing more.","This new phone which I bought through Cingular at a discount is good, but not great. The ONE thing I really don't like about this phone is the volume. I can barely hear someone on the other end. Even after turning the volume all the way up and turning the noise detection program on and off...still nothing. My Nokia 6010 was much better. The camera is okay, nothing great. Turning this thing on and off takes forever....much slower than my other Nokia, which was 3 years old. Yes, it has a radio, BUT you have to BUY a headset to be able to listen....rip off!I like: The MP3 ringtone, speaker phone and Bluetooth capability. I love Nokia's customer friendly/ease of use. I will keep this phone because it was cheap and it's not really, really bad. But if you want something with better volume/ speaker and higher resolution camera, look elsewhere.Moses W.Harrisburg, PA"
2,Would not buy again,"I had to get a new phone since my old motorola phone stopped charging, so I thought I would try something new. There are a couple pros, but more cons with this phone.Pros:-Long battery life-Good size-Buttons are easy to pressCons:-You have to hit waaaay to many buttons to send a text, extremely annoying-Feels weak and flimsy (I dropped it for the first time after having it for months, and it won't open and close correctly anymore.)Overall, I would not buy this phone again, it has a cheap feel to it, and from what I have experienced, it functions like a cheap phone."
3,It's lasted,"I have a tendency to go through phones very very quickly. This one has actually made it. Yes the antenna casing fell off, lil glue and its fine, and the casing chips. Ohh and in the summer the screen gets a little distorted at the bottom. But even with all my phones attraction to cement, it has survived. One other thing, you have to save the phone book on the phone and not the card, everything saves to the phone so it's gets tight, but I have yet to break it, so that gives it an extra star."
4,A SORT OF DALLAS OF THE FIFTIES,"Part three of the so called AMERICAN trilogy by director STEVENS after A PLACE IN THE SUN and SHANE.Before making this film that gave him his star status, ROCK HUDSON had made a few romantic movies with SIRK.Basically, this is an elegant soap opera with a few overblown touches that fortunately don't detract the overall effect.The set pieces makes the film quite unique as a whole.JAMES DEAN in his last role gets the MARLON BRANDO award for making all his gestures count.ELISABETH is at her best, even if it's hard to imagine she can age so fast during the film.Of great historical interest since it was probably the most awaited movie of 1956."
3,doesn't live up to it's title,"was expecting a big movie but the title ""giant"" doesn't live up to it's name.would have expected a big movie full screen etc.the extra's are ok but nothing flash or interestingneeds a remaster"
1,Movie Purchase - Giant,"Playback was not smooth. The movie was interrupted several times b/c of ""Loading"". I would prefer to download the movie to my computer and watch without the buffering or ""loading"" screen coming up every 5 minutes. Do you offer a download of this? At the very least can I download it to my PS3? What are my options since the download option is not given from my computer?"
3,Why?,"In all fairness, I would rate this film 5 stars and the transfer 1 star. At a time when almost every film issued in widescreen is also 'enhanced for widescreen TVs' (or anamorphic meaning the same thing) Giant comes out LBX. This means that unless it is expanded (which ruins both the color and the clarity) the picture will be crunched. Many older films (Gigi for one which came out around the time of Giant) have been issued in an anamorphic format, so why not Giant? An anamorphic format can be played on a 4 by 3 TV or a widescreen TV equally well but an LBX can be played well only on a 4 by 3 TV. So I am waiting, hoping for an anamorphic issue or - wouldn't it be great! - Blu ray."
1,GIANT. A stunning disappointment in DVD!,"GIANT. A stunning disappointment in DVD!I have been a fan of Giant for many years, and have seen the film many times. I had looked forward to the DVD re-issue, anticipating all the benefits of DVD quality and presentation. What a disappointment this disc has been! Although the blurb for the set describes the film as being transferred from ""revitalized film elements"" it is, as far as I can tell, nothing more than the same video tape that was used for the laserdisc version several years ago.It is NOT a new digital transfer, and it is NOT anamorphic. Detail is appallingly bad for a DVD, color has been hyped up but surface texture is poor. Zooming the picture to fill a 16:9 screen produces picture quality hardly better than VHS. It really looks no better than the laserdisc, and it is a crime to have lavishly re-issued this set without a new anamorphic 16:9 compatible transfer. This is one for the resale bin immediately."
2,"A great movie, but very poor restoration work","I bought this DVD with high expectations having first seen this film as a child - and should be giving it a five star rating. But I was extremely disappointed upon viewing the DVD which contains some of the worst edge enhancement I have ever seen. Hence the two star rating. In many scenes people and animals have glowing neon-like halos surrounding them! How can this film be said to have been restored??!! It would seem the Studio was in one big rush to get this DVD onto the market and had I been aware of this awful transfer, I would never have bought it.Older movies than Giant have been restored to pristine quality - take a look at Spartacus as an example. So, Warner Bros. please go back to the drawing board with this film and restore it the way it should have been done in the first place."
3,Giant movie,"The movie is good But, the disc is jumpy it starts and stops all through the movie. I do not recommend the DVD from this source."
1,No better than VHS,"I love this movie and watch it once a year and every year I am reminded just what a bad job they did building this version. Colors are way off, picture is stretched from original aspect ratio so all the characters are short and wide. I have watched this on a very high end projector, 47"" LCD HD flat screen and 27"" CRT. It looks best on the smaller screen because of the lack of detail and poor color rendition. Don't buy this DVD if you still have the VHS. A competent production studio needs to overhaul this movie by returning it to it's original aspect ratio and correcting the color in a BLU RA version."
3,GIANT video,"I received this video, and was anxious to watch the movie, but all I heard was a whirring sound. I looked at the tape and determined that it wouldn't work. I couldn't move the tape manually, so I got a small screw driver and inserted into the small hole that releases the tape so it can feed. The plastic at the bottom of the hole was stuck. I pushed down hard and the trap door popped loose. It worked fine after that."
5,Giant,Ordered and received this item in a great transaction. Item brand new and still in it's original wrapping. I received this item quickly and overall am very happy with it. Thanks! A+
1,Was Not Pleased,I was disappointed with this order. This was sent to a friend and when she went to play it the disc had nothing on it. She has wanted this Film for a very long time. It was sent back to Amazon and she has heard nothing to date. I tried to call but got no response. You don't make it easy to reach you customer service. I will give you a second chance because this is the first time this has happened. Please take care of this problem and when I watch the movie I will be glad to write a review on it.Thank YouB. Camarra
4,On eof the greatest American films ever made transferred to DVD with dismal sound.,"I have nothing but affection for this wonderful George Stevens film of Edna Ferber's novel about Texas. Elizabeth Taylor is luminous and this makes it a real tragedy that this DVD edition of ""Giant"" has the worst sound I've ever heard. It's so weakly inaudible, even at the highest volume settings of my player and my stereo, that it's almost whispered. I found myself wondering if I had a bad disk copy. But both the Special Features disk and the main movie are exactly the same. I will anticipate the release of a re-mastered Blu Ray version."
1,Very poor sound quality,The sound on the DVD was out of sync and totally incomprehensible at times. I have contacted the seller for replacement or refund. I have not heard back yet.
5,One of my favorite all time classics,"This movie is one of my favorite all time classic movie to watch. If you love James Dean, and Rock Hudson this is the movie for you."
4,Definitely Earned Its Oscar,"I had never seen a James Dean or Rock Hudson film and was impressed by their performances here, with a theme that still resonates today.My wife had been talking about this movie for a while and so I finally bought a copy here on Amazon. It is a long movie, but that really gives you time to sit with the characters and develop a caring for them.The movie shows the growth and development of that characters over a 30 year period and deals with issues of racism, greed, jealousy and family.A great family-friendly film with solid performances from all involved."
1,TENGAN CUIDADO LOS HISPANOS,"EXISTE UN ERROR EN LA DESCRIPCION DEL PRODUCTO, EL DVD NO TIENE OPCION PARA VER LA PELICULA EN IDIOMA ESPAÑOL.YO COMPRE ESTE DVD CON EL FIN DE VERLO EN EL IDIOMA EN ESPAÑOL Y ME DI CON LA INGRATA SORPRESA QUE SOLO ESTA EN SUBTITULO EN ESPAÑOL.AMAZON DEBERIA REALIZAR LA CORRECCION RESPECTIVA Y TENER MAS CUIDADO EN PRESENTAR LAS CARACTERISTICAS DEL PRODUCTO."
2,Disjointed narrative,"Maybe you have to be from Texas or over 50 or something to enjoy this movie. It had some great characters to be sure, but the narrative was just a collection of unrelated events--an extremely LONG collection of unrelated events. Couple meets, gets married, sister in law dies, have kids, kids grow up. The only threads: an occasional fight would erupt with the jerk played by James Dean, and at the end it explodes. And Dad learns to tone down his racism a little bit, but not too much.It's really a three star, but I'm taking off an extra for sheer length. Three hours a movie that's neither good nor bad."
5,Very Good Movie,"This is an excellent movie for the entire family. It touches issues of racism, feminism,class and family dynamics. Visually great!"
3,Giant,"Remembered thizs older movie differently---not so corny and with better acting particularly on James Dean's part. Liz Taylor was her normal gorgeous self,"
1,Giant,The movie was great it brought back old memories of the first viewing years ago. The only problem I found was that the disc that the movie was on did not have any label stating that it was the movie and that it was part 1 and part 2 was on the other side. Other than that I was well pleased. Alton
5,Geek TShirt,"My son loves this shirt. It hits his sense of the absurd and yet intellectual.The idea that folks struggle to read the binary code only to find the words ""You Are Dumb"" appeals to his sense of 14 year old humor.Shirt was of fine quality too."
2,I guess I'll never know,Purchased from cosmetic solutions on amazon and the tube arrived used! I contacted the seller and didn't get a response. It looks pretty enough but I guess I'll never know how it looks on(me).
4,Highly recommended!,"First of all, double umbrella strollers are quite hard to come by. This one is exceptional, especially for the price. I use it traveling - it's quick and easy to fold up, even while holding two babies. It's very sturdy, rugged enough for multiple flights and mass-transit uses throughout San Francisco, Berkeley and New York, so far."
3,Nice stroller but difficult to assemble,"The stroller was good for travel. Sturdy, but easy to travel with. It was difficult to assemble, especially putting on the canopy. I had to call customer service because I thought it was defective. The directions are terrible! Once assembled the canopy did pop off a couple of times on one side. I think the engineers need to rethink how this stroller is put together!"
4,GOOD BUY!!!!,"I really like this stroller! It is super light, easy to manuver, folds up nicely, my girls love it..and the really love being next to each other! With my stadium stroller someone was either kicking the back or pulling hair..and fighting who is in back or front...the only thing I would say about it...it does just about make it through the door ways..it makes it but a tight squeeze. The canopy I can't figure out for the life of me ...but that is minor...cup holder is decent and at least it holds something. No storage bin but I hang everything from the handles...it's a good buy for the money and my kids love it and that is all that matters!"
4,Great shave and scent,"I've purchased this several times, whenever I have a spare $20 on hand. This stuff smells great and helps give a razor burn free shave nicely. Leaves a bit of almond smell and smooth .. Momma sure digs it! Just wish it wasn't as expensive. Will keep on buying from time to time, I'm sure."
3,"Works great as an oil, the scent migt as well not exist","While as a lubrication to your face I found that the product does a great job, I was dissapointed with the scent. This is basically the first thing I smell in the morning and I was hoping for something with a bit more of an aroma."
2,"Some good pictures, mostly a let down","This large picture book had some interesting photos of true cowgirls, but mostly it was just old 1950's artists' reditions. Not really what you might hope for. Like the cover? That is pretty much the entire book. Really no inforamtion about true American cowgirls, just some over used pictures."
2,Failure is in the execution,"The positive reviews had me so hopeful. The best part of this baster is the cleaning brush to clean other stuff. This oval mouthed baster sounded so great, but it WILL NOT hold hot liquids. It spills, pours out and is utterly worthless as a baster. Yes if you hold the oval horizontal is doesn't spill AS FAST as if you hold it vertical, but it still pours out. Maybe it would hold thick cold liquids like maple syrup, but for basting a turkey it is a failure."
5,Everything you ever needed to know about the Bible!!!!!,A consise; well written dictionary that answers all the questions that you could ever think to ask. It is so complete that I am amazed at Fr. McKenzie's ability to author such a huge body of work.Surely it was with Divine Intervention. This book deserves a place in the book case of every Catholic.
4,Dictionary of the Bible,"This is so much more than the dictionaries I have used over the years. It gives detailed explanations of words and concepts that link those to other personalities or relationships and times, and not just a brief interpretation of a word. Very useful to connect and understand events and philosophies of both Old and New Testament times."
3,further adventures of poor Wilt; not amongst the best,"'Wilt on High' is another installment of our hapless suburban lecturer Henry Wilt who somehow gets into a total mess with his befuddled wife, demonic quadruplet daughters, the neighbours, the police, and the militia. The story is typical Sharpe craziness; it really isn't worth trying to explain it all. However 'Wilt on High' strikes me as one of Sharpe's weaker efforts, which is especially disappointing since the book starts off rather nicely.It is advisable to read 'Wilt' before 'Wilt on High' since it is more or less a sequel. Besides 'Wilt' is a much better read - a classic."
2,Brian Evans - Abu Dhabi,This book suprised me because I did not find it at all funny and this is a first for this author. The usual dark humor and madness was mostly of a cruel bland content. The quadruplet daughters lacked depth of character to be believed in their antics. The humour is just not up to the previous standard which make me wounder who is acutally writing this book. The first book 'Wilt' was really 'Funny' but sadly this sequel falls a long way short.
4,An old but good game.....,"I have had this game on my hard drive for several years. This game is much better than Silent Hunter II. This game was done right and it's a lot of fun to play. Doesn't seem like developers know how to make a good submarine sim today.Be warned, this game is old. It may not work on new computers."
3,Silent Hunter,This game is quite advanced for a DOS game. It is stable. The learning curve is no too steap. Game manual on disc. It installed through Wln Me. Ran under pure DOS.
3,Some Outstanding Moments,"Josh Ritter's ""Golden Age of Radio"" is a passable singer-songwriter album that bursts through with the occasional decent tune. Unfortunately, there aren't quite enough of them to give the album an unqualified recommendation. At his best, such as on the songs ""Me and Jiggs"" and ""Lawrence, KS,"" Ritter's music is cathcy and melodi and punctuated by some memorable lyrics. ""Jiggs"" also features an uptempo energy that is decidedly lacking in the rest of the album. Most of the tracks are slow and accoustic, which wouldn't be a problem if the overall songwriting were stronger. Bland songs are bland songs, and they can't disguise themselves in such a format. Ritter leaves you with the impression that he's an artist with the talent to record a great album, he just hasn't done so yet.Overall, an average album with some very fine moments."
4,Golden Age Of Ritter,"I have at least 3 John Ritter CD's now and he is the real thing. This is one of the CDs I own and it is a keeper. It seems that every track on his albums are well thought out and very well constructed. A lot of quality here. He's become for me the type of artist that you can just go ahead and purchase his stuff before hearing it, in other words, well trusted. I give it 4 stars now because it is so recent, in a few years, with time, the almighty judge, who knows, it may get that 5th star and become a classic."
5,very pleased,I ordered the 180pc bottle and it arrived very quickly thanks to my amazon prime 2 day shipping. the bottle is pretty small i figured it was going to be larger im wondering what the 90pc bottle looks like. but thats not anything to complain about the pills are very small and easy to take. I am actually giving this to my dog in half doses for his hair growth and anxiety. its too soon to see if its really doing anything but i would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for Melatonin especially if you want Melatonin with out anything else added to it.MC
2,Bad taste and Vitamin B6 is added,"I think this product works okay, but the taste is not good. Most melatonin products taste decent, but this one tastes pretty bad. Also, for those of you looking for Melatonin only, this product does contain B6. Even though it's more expensive, I like Source Naturals orange melatonin tablets better. They have a great taste and no B6."
1,"Tastes really, really bad","I'd been using Vitamin Shoppe melatonin lozenges, but I tried this out because it's cheaper. The taste was just really, really bad. I can't attest to how well it works, honestly, because I couldn't bear to let it dissolve. Given the otherwise good reviews that this seems to have I suppose that others don't have such an adverse taste reaction to it, but personally I can't tolerate it. Source Naturals makes the best tasting one I've found, but it's also the most expensive of the three I've mentioned."
2,Vitamin B-6,"This has 150% of the RDA for Vitamin B-6. I was looking for a product that only contained Melatonin. I see now that B-6 is listed as an ingredient in the list, but I overlooked it. A picture of the ""Supplement Facts"" should be with this listing so people do not miss this important information.I have no other reviews being that I'm not sure a child can even have this much B-6."
1,NOW Melatonin lozenges,"I regret ordering this product. I think that NOW products are inferior as they are loaded with inferior binding agents and such. This particluar procuct has a synthetic sweetener, which really disappointed me. I will not be taking this product!"
5,Hard to decide but...,"This is definitely the best DMST album to date. Hard to decide between this and Winter Hymn Country Hymn Secret Hymn but this one tops it because every song is memorable. I've had all their albums for about a year now and this is the only one i still listen to without skipping tracks, its all good. If your real enthusiastic about this you should get WHCHSH if only for the first track, ""Frederica"". Then stop listening to post rock."
4,Flowing away,"4 1/2I might have overstated a bit in calling this still underrated group's latest their best (one of the only reviews I ever rated immediately on release), when fans make it obvious this was always the one. Revisiting it, especially on headphones, all the production intricacies around deceptively simple heavy jams become stunningly obvious. It is a little light as a whole, but flows more compellingly as such than most post-rock entries. This quantum songwriting leap from an already fascinatingly played school-of-Tortoise debut solidified the group as true artists in a genre filled with predictabilities."
4,The landlord is dead,"One of the best things out of Canada. The track ""The landlord is dead"" is one of my favorite instrumental songs. If you like Explosions in the Sky this band will interest you, but unlike explosions their songs dont flow together, each song is presented as its own song. Great solid album. My only problem with it is that at times, it seems repetative, because usually once the song establishes a riff, it stays throughout the song. But other than that, it is a great album."
3,Not as engaging as her other books,"I've read several of Wick's novels, and although I enjoyed the subplot of Rusty's growing relationship with Quintin, I thought the romance storyline was flat and unemotional. Chase was too stiff and aloof, and it was unbelievable that a woman with Rusty's personality would fall in love with him. I truly enjoy reading Wick's books; so far I think Sean Donovan is the best. I'm working on reading all of her novels."
5,Promise Me Tomorrow (Rock Mountain Memories #4),"If you enjoy reading, order. Make sure not to order from pt-textbooks."
4,"Good series,but another incident of a character name change!","I have liked all 4 books in the Rocky Mountain Memories series,but I was disappointed when I immediately noticed that the character of Kaitlin was now suddenly called Katherine! I don't understand what the problem is that an author cannot keep either the story-lines,and/or the character's name straight?This is the only reason that I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 stars. Otherwise I think it is a very good story,and I enjoyed it.It was refreshing to read about such nice people with no evil character for a change,and I love the inside view we get of the growth of the different character's personal relationships with God."
4,The price is right,"The music is eclectic but mostly interesting. It is a cheap CD with 62'46 of play time. The first piece, Frank Nuyts give me your bunch of fives, is really great. That 2'17 is almost worth the money. The middle of the CD is dominated by a twenty minute work for organ and percussion which can either take you back to silent movies accompanied by organ and sound effects on a welcome visualisation trip or bore you to tears. It is curious that tracks 13 and 14 don't make it in with the list of the rest of the tracks on the back of the CD. Maybe the label skipped the editor to make the CD cheap. For all you percussionists out there, this might be a fun one."
4,GOOD PET STROLLER,"This is a decent stroller. It will hold 2 small dogs between 6-10 lbs. I previously had a bigger stroller which gave them more room, but was difficult to fold and lift into the cargo bin of my SUV. This stroller is smaller and much easier to fold and lighter weight. However, this stroller would be difficult for a person taller than 5'5"" to push due to it's height.Regarding customer service: I called Petzip to help with a small assembly problem and they kept putting me off in 30min increments. Then they wanted me to email them pictures of the problem and promised to call back the next day. When you are trying to assemble your stroller you do not wish to wait until the next day for help. I consider this very poor customer service!So, I kept trying to assemble the brake assembly unit myself and figured it out without their assistance.Just wanted other buyers to beware of the poor customer service with this company."
2,disappointed,"I at least expected the wheels to be rubber, rather than hard plastic. For the money, this stroller is not worth it. sorry. I got just about the same quality from a stroller I purchased for $29 on Amazon."
3,No Pictures?,"I confess, I haven't bought this second edition. I was going to buy it...which is why I looked it up. I have the first edition. But what I find puzzling is that apparently, judging by the product description, the photos in the first edition have been removed, rendering the book merely a research guide...though based on one of the customer reviews, even that is woefully out of date. I'm disappointed!"
1,A MISGUIDED PURCHASE.....,"Oh, the pain of modern research! Yeah right. This is a painfully thin and disappointing ""guide"" for movie buffs--or more specifically fans of movie ""buff"". Precious few items of value here unless you're still a VHS junkie. Only a handful of the films listed are available on DVD which makes this book outdated. Even more disturbing are the listings featuring children naked. YUCK! What kind of audience do these people have in MIND? Who cares if this or that is ""glimpsed"" or a ""brief shot""? And needless to say a lot of these titles are out of print so why bother? Skip this waste of time and look for something more accurate, in depth and less pedophilic. Somebody should yank THIS out of print."
5,Mrs. Miniver,"A Classic of WWII and England. This movie embodies all that was good about the people of the UK back then. This is a production like no other about the major events of WWII, as seen by the British and their unique point of view. After all, they were the ones being Bombed and Buzzed during those days. Cast is excellent, right down to the 'bit' players."
3,Mrs. Miniver,"I remember seeing this film years ago and wanted to add it to my collection. While still a good film, it does show it's age. I got a kick out of seeing Mrs. M. waking up in the morning perfectly made-up with not a hair out of place. Such was Hollywood in the 40's and 50's. The story of the bravery of the British people during the war was touching. I have always admired them for their courage and dignity."
3,Mrs. Miniver,I ordered this DVD for my mother-in-law for Christmas and she was very excited to get it until she went to watch it. The audio was very poor quality. I tried it on my DVD player and it was fine. I don't know if certain players are compatible for certain movies.

4,Great Beginners Book!,"Paint Shop Pro Web Graphics - Third Edition focuses on using Paint Shop Pro 7 program by JASC Software, with a few diversions. Chapter 5, for example, covers Web Graphic Basics, which may be useful to some readers.If you are familiar with Paint Shop Pro 6, or work with web graphics on a more advanced level you may find this book not extremely helpful. I do feel it is a very good beginners book for using the latest version of this software. JASC Software has made tremendous leaps to improve this program and with a few exceptions this book covers the software in a concise manner.On the downside, I was extremely disappointed in their not covering a few topics that the advanced web graphic artist would need, and those were Alpha Channels, Adjustment Layers, Actions, and Masks. . I wish these types of books would come with the images used in the book on a CD. The examples in this book are available on-line as an almost 3 MG zip file."
2,Luke warm book on PSP web graphics,"I found a lot of the explanations to be too brief or dificult to follow. Many of the questions I have are not cover at all and when I needed help with roll-over techniques, the section is completely missing from my copy. I realize this is not the author's fault but it was the preverbial straw."
2,Disappointing,"I read the reviews here and bought this book hoping to learn to use PSP7 to make exciting Web graphics. Aside from a couple of useful chapters, I found the book lacking in substantial information. The writing is very dry, like a text book. Further, the graphic samples used to illustrate this book are amateurish and...well, just awful.The tutorials in the Getting Started book that came with PSP7 are much more useful than what is found in this book. I was hoping that Paint Shop Pro Web Graphics would serve as a great supplement to the documents that came with PSP. Unfortunately, I was disappointed."
3,In retrospect I should have gotten a bigger one...,"I bought this one based on what I thought my needs would be, it's great cost and it's smaller size (making for easier storage). In restrospect I was a bit short sighted. While my reasons were all quite valid and for the right person this would meet someones needs it didn't end up meeting all of mine.The first problem is that even if it is big enough most of the time, there are times it isnt quite big enough (say for a large amount of pasta or washing a large amount of lettuce). It also isn't wide enough to hang off a *large* stock pot (to sit the draining pasta back in the pot) all that well. I would also say that one that *stands* taller in the sink for draining is a bit more convenient.If I had to re-buy this I would go with a bigger model (which I ultimately had to buy anyway). All that said, this is an item that would be excellent if it met the needs of the buyer."
1,Rip off,Never got the product--what a rip off. I have had one for 12 years but when the gift order is not delievered quality does not matter.
4,Small Bar Pan,I ordered the wrong size bar pan. Made a great deal and ordered the large one for a good price and kept the small bar pan. Like both.
3,"Not her best, but still worth the time","If you like Binchy's work, you may find this one a bit of a disappointment, but it still has the Binchy touch of life. I found that the mini-stories weren't as developed that they could have been and I was left wondering about a few things, but overall, I did enjoy the stories. They were intersting, but just not as good as some of the other one's I've read by this author."
3,"Great story-telling,Binchy repeats herself.","Characters are so real and credible,the story is so simple and engaging,yet I have the feeling I read it in another book...another Binchy story collection.Still despite repetitions,it's nice to re-read what you like.Great story-teller,keeps you turning the pages,yet I'd like her to reinvent herself with the addition of some new content,strikingly different."
2,Skip this one. Not up to par with MB's other books,"This book was chock full of short stories. One chapter each. MB's meticulous writing style and strength of character development are what make her books wonderful. Chapter long stories just aren't her showcase. Even if you've read every book she's written but this one, don't do it. You'll be disappointed"
2,London Transports,"Since November 2011 I have read all of Maeve Binchy's books and London Transports was the last. I was very disappointed. Not anywhere up to Maeve's usual standard. Some of the stories barely get started and then they end. In fact, I was contemplating not bothering to finish the book but I pressed on in hopes that it would improve. Some of the stories towards the end of the book are better. Having said all of this, I still would heartily recommend any other of Maeve's books. They are all quite captivating. Just don't read London Transports first or you may not want to continue to read her other books and that would be a shame!"
1,disappointing,I was very disappointed in this book of short stories and I am a huge Maeve Binchey fan. I liked all her other short story books so much. It was hard to believe she wrote these. i did not like any of them. Every other book has been so good.
4,"An easy, readable book","Maeve Binchy is, by far, my favorite author and I find it difficult to criticize anything she writes. London Transports was definitely a readable collection of short stories, although it wasn't her best. She repeats herself in one story...it shows up later in The Return Journey. On the plus side, however, some of the stories deal with topics not presented in her other books. They shine with Binchy's wit and style that I always enjoy in all her books, and I never thought once about stopping. If you are a die-hard Binchy fan who has made it your goal to read all her works (like me), go ahead and read this book. It's worth it."
3,A Little Disappointing,This book is disappointing in that it is a collection of short stories instead of Binchy's classic epics. Just as the reader gets involved in the character or plot the story ends and proceeds to the next one. Binchy's books that stick with one grand story is definately better.
4,Good tub reading,Great Book to read in the tub and forget about your own life. Bincy blasts you in and out of the lives of strangers. Strangers who you can identify with on some level in each story. Somehow you end up wishing the short stories were each one book.
2,Illegal?,"The songs on this cd are great, but NOWHERE ON THE CASE DOES IT SAY THAT THE SONGS ARE SUNG BY OTHER PEOPLE! I bought the cd under the impression that they were originals...I feel like I was cheated out of my money. I plan to return it."
4,yearly replacement,"I use the Iomega Zip Drive. The disks work well for quite awhile, but eventually for no reason, have to be replaced. The three pack is the best deal."
5,zip disks,Zip drives and disks have been a favorite of mine as they are easy to use.The product I ordered was exactly what I wanted so I am very pleased by the experience.
4,Very Funky!,"This album of 20 Fingers is very funky and some of the language is x-rated, and the beat is incredible! It is an acquired taste, similar to Nina Hagen of Germany's 1980's Punk Era."
5,Great Anthology Of Early Chris DeBurgh,"BEST MOVES is a great anthology of the early work of British singer-songwriter Chris DeBurgh. The obvious influences here are Donovan and the Moody Blues, and the songs are very relaxing. This is true even of the more intense numbers such as ""The Traveller"" and ""Spanish Train."" Granted, there are moments that might appeal more to devout Christians than to the average person, and DeBurgh would improve by adding a Steve Miller/Bob Seger influence on the harder-rocking THE GETAWAY and MAN ON THE LINE, but if you want to hear his early work, this is the CD to get."
5,"Amazing, i cannot believe i'm tatting! ...from a book!?","I don't learn from reading. I learn from being taught in real life, by a real person. Well this book taught me. This book is definitely for anyone who is just like me. It is amazing and i cannot believe it but i'm tatting. I picked it up and did it like i always just knew how and could. I will post some images from all i've done in about 3 days of having this book. I'm hooked and i would have payed upward of $50 for this book. Amazing. I'll be using tatting in jewelry making, crazy quilting and much more."
4,Good book for a complete novice.,Clear instructions with good pictures for visual learners. This was so simple that I was on the internet looking for new patterns within two hours. A very good explanation and instructions. Since the needles were included with the set I didn't have to go searching for them elsewhere and the multiple sizes of the needles will keep me going for a long time.
4,Engaging look at the place of music in 1950s America,"While Barzun's presentation seems a bit stream-of-consciousness in places, one hardly minds because of the comprehensive totality of his approach. Much like his magnificent (and far more recent) tome, From Dawn to Decadence, this book captures a picture of history as revealed through people, places, art, politics and all the various components of humanistic experiences.Barzun provides the reader with a glimpse of the place of music in American society in the late 1950s. In some areas, his criticisms are blunt, but even-handed. He does not vilify academia or popular music, but is not afraid to point out their limitations. He asks the reader to be aware of pedantry in all its guises."
3,Not nearly as pink as pictured.,They have a pink hue but don't show a big difference from my white pearl earrings. Didn't bother returning.
3,"Barely pink, but pretty anyway","Unfortunately, I agree with the other reviewers who have said these pearls are not nearly as pink as the picture makes them seem. They're more of a grayish pink - think storm clouds at sunset. On the plus side, they have a beautiful lustre. Another reviewer stated that she bought these earrings as a gift for her little girl. Though the pearls are small, they could be worn by an adult. In sum, they are lovely earrings as long as you don't expect them to be truly pink. I paid $13.19 on sale for mine and will keep them and wear them."
5,Buen Merengue!,"Este cd de Melao criollo es muy bueno. Todos los temas son bien bailable y pegajosos. Te gusta el buen merengue,Pues toma melao....Melao Criollo..."
4,Pleasant Memories and Literary Pleasure,"I found this book to be a beautiful, well-written distraction - a great rainy-day-long-weekend-nothing-better-to-do-but-relax-and-read read. I loved the characters, the unfolding story, the atmosphere and the solemn, albeit joyful ending. Uncle Joseph...and the surly Andrew Treverton, characters whom you might regard as one-dimensional give the novel dimension and feeling.A book I have borrowed and will part with soon enough, I think it is something I would eventually like to add to my own library. It is a novel that nourishes... the pages often fly by without you noticing. I put off reading the end because I didn't want it to end. What else can one say? If you like Collins - and this is perhaps one of the better earlier novels - I'd say jump in. (I still have to read ""The Moonstone"" and ""The Woman in White""...getting there...things to do, books to read... if there was world enough and time....).That's that."
3,early Collins work shows promise..,"Wilkie Collins has written some brilliant crime/mystery novels during his career, most notably The Woman in White / No Name / The Moonstone. His earlier works are almost unknown nowadays. But such obscurity is unwarrented, at least in the case of The Dead Secret.The Dead Secret tells a simple story of a mystery surrounding an untold secret of a dying wealthy woman. This woman's secret is shared only with her servant. Despite the woman's dying wish, the servant does not divulge the secret ... with unpleasent results. Eventually the secret is revealed and all is understood.The novel works well mostly because it is fast paced, and it has all the richness of a Collins novel (ie, it is well-written). No, it isn't as clever or suspenseful as Collins's later works. But Wilkie Collins fans should place The Dead Secret on their 'must read' list."
3,An early Collins work with a taste of greatness to come,"Wilkie Collins wrote ""The Dead Secret"" early in his career as a novelist, and his inexperience shows here--but the Collins aficionado will welcome the opportunity to see how his gifts first manifest themselves in this relatively simple story. He gathers together all the usual suspects: a wealthy family, an old house, a charming child, and the member of the house staff who harbors the secret in question. While Collins falls short in his effort to sketch an unrequited yearning (I can't go into more detail if you haven't read the book), he does a beautiful job of portraying the subtle class differences and behaviors in this particular house."
1,Too Flowery,"The idea of a journal of a divorced (and betrayed) mid-life woman who must be present for her dying father and suffering mother is not only relevant for many, it is a needed genre. Unfortunately, this treatment was designed to expand the author's use of adjectives rather than substance. If you read carefully, you will find the tidbits of heart-felt emotion, but you would be better off to spend your money on a book that doesn't make it so difficult to connect with authenticity."
1,YOU CALL THIS A MOVIE?,"People like me who've seen the first one know that this one was nothing but a money making ploy by the movie producers & people at the company. (Artisan Ent.??) THe first one had humor, heart, and that loveable, bumbling Felix & his dog Rambo. The sequel--if you can call it that--is unoriginal, unimaginative, and downright boring. They reused the same theme from the first movie. How unoriginal is that!!! If there was a 0 on the rating system that would be my real rating for this movie. A BIG FAT 0!!"
1,Why?,"While the original movie was cute, this follow-up was insipid. Why do the people behind films find that stereotyped Gay characters are acceptable? Hollywood is a travesty and is what middle America will think all Gay men are like."
3,A different live mannequin,"This sequel to 1987's MANNEQUIN was a flop. Nobody from the first film appears in this one. This film stars William Ragsdale who starred in 1985's FRIGHT NIGHT. Kristy Swanson is the mannequin. This film is somewhat memorable for me because Meshach Taylor of TV's Designing Women was part of the cast. The only recycling is Starship's recording NOTHING'S GONNA STOP US NOW which was played during the end credits like the first film. Swanson would later star in ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"",that film later inspiring the TV series starring Sarah Michelle Gellar."
4,Sound Is Too Thick at Times,"About every other Kenny Wheeler record seems to be really outstanding, and the others are always at least pretty good. This is one of the pretty good ones. The core group comprises Wheeler on flugelhorn, John Taylor on piano, and a name new to me, John Parricelli, on guitar. The core group is augmented by a brass choir consisting of four trumpets, two trombones, and two bass trombones. All the music was composed by Kenny Wheeler, and as you might expect, it is tuneful, complex, and introspective. To these ears at least, the sound of the brass choir seems a bit thick in spots (musically, that is), with the most enjoyable moments in the recording to be found among those featuring the core group rather than the full ensemble. Wheeler is certainly a remarkable musician, and brass fans are going to love this recording, thick textures and all. The sound quality seemed just a notch below ECM's very best--but that's still pretty good, just like the music."
1,If you didn't write this software...,"...then don't try to use it. I've been waiting a month for any response from thier technical support. The documentation is hysterically bad. There are sections describing how to use one's mouse and what ""selecting"" means, and the rest of it is diabolically confused. There's never any indication of where functions being discussed are found, how to interpret the constantly shifting barrage of hybrid computer hardware/technical recording industry/made-up control name terminology, or... really, anything. It's useless. Several of the keyboard commands don't work, the icons are impossible to interpret, and there's no way to guess what parts of the intricate interface are active and which are merely display. If you have weeks and weeks of time on end, as I do at the moment, to play with it, and are masochistic, like me, then by all means purchase this product."
2,not a cool music studio!,"After installing the Magix music studio into our computer we soon wished we never had!(pc) The digital audio recording didn't work well: it was only possible at a VERY low volume and often the sequencer started 'skipping', so that no recording was possible. Using this program also caused a lot of 'damaged files' into our system and finally we had to restore the whole computer. The notation in the program was OK, though. And if it works in your computer, it's quite easy to use and has a lot of cool stuff.Cool effects and a nice mixer."
4,PhotoImpact Solutions,"While the book has some excellent areas for beginners, it lacks detail on the myraid of the tools available with this excellent software. The book is worth the investment, but for beginners, it requires the manual supplied with the software to truely understand the tools available and their use."
1,Disappointed,"I am a new user to PhotoImpact, so after reading the reviews here, I purchased the book. A picture is worth a thousand words..well, the illustrations in this book are the worse I have ever seen...you can hardly read the lettering on the illustrations...even the illustrations are fuzzy. I am so very disappointed."
1,Disappointing,I bought the book. Luckily I bought used. The binding broke not long after I bought it (without much use). I had to wade through the book. It has some good pearls if you can last that long.
4,Native Boy Tale Charms Kids of All Cultures,Naiche is described so stirringly in this book by Dr. Tayac that any native or non-native American would want to know him. Many American children in 2002 grow up multi-culturally and this wonderfully written children's book clearly evokes a compelling portrait of Naiche's world. The richness of Naiche's Indian culture will expand the horizons of any child who reads this page turner.
1,battery powered trash,"cute idea at best. my cat jumped on it twice, and that was all she wrote. can't take much cat hair, either; but then, who has cat hair on the floor anyway?"
2,Good Idea -- Poorly Made,"Worked great for a short while. Now that the cats are interested in it, it doesn't hold the charge any more. What a disappointment to both me and my cat."
1,Horrible,"Not sure if it works or not because the screw on the battery door is stripped and nothing on this earth will get it out. If it was meant as a way to keep a human busy for hours then it works as it should. As a cat toy, well I wouldn't really know since I can't even put a battery in it."
1,Remote Control Mouse Toy - DOA,"The recipient of this gift stated that it took her 45 minutes to get the mouse to work. Then she kept pumping batteries into the toy, only to have it die after a few minutes. The toy was broken on the first day. Dead on Arrival! Sounded like a great idea for an indoor cat."
5,GREAT TOY (but make sure you put it away afterward),I love this toy and so does my kitten! I have tried numerous moving mouse toys such as the cy-purr mouse and the battery opreated mouse in the plastic ball but he didnt like those because they are way to slow. He chases it everywhere and especially likes to swat it when it goes too close to his food bowl. The only problem with this is that it is small and white and so is the kitchen floor where it works best. I forgot to put it away and a few hours later I stepped on it so now im buying another. Hopefully this one will last more than 2 days.
3,Maybe look for something else.,"My cat didn't enjoy this at all. She seemed more scared then anything else. My sister and I had a better time steering it into things and scaring family members with this item, then the kitten did playing with it. It's more for the owner then the cat."
2,Works for a little while,"This is a great idea but it's very cheaply made. The charge doesn't last long and cat hair clogs the wheels. It works best on non-carpeted surfaces. It's an ok toy if you don't mind taking it apart and cleaning out the cat hair. But, my cats love this mouse so I've continued to buy new ones after they break. I'm on my 4th mouse in less than a year. First one stopped taking the charge, the second one would only turn left, 3rd one never worked from the beginning. I'm looking for a little R/C car to replace the mouse all together."

1,Unacceptable amount of information provided.,"I am amazed that the authors of this ""publication?"" expect anyone to purchase their product on the amount of skimpy information they provide about content. Where are the sample pages? Their editorial review is totally inadequate.These authors are saving a significant amount by using the PDF/download approach to marketing. Too bad they didn't decide to pass their savings on to the consumer!"
3,This is a new release,"This DVD is released on Oct 12, 2010, so the first two reviews from 2004 & 2005 are not applicable to this DVD (contains 44 movies as correctly listed in the 3rd review)"
1,Disappointed,"I love these cheap multiple Disc sets, they're loaded with all the B movies I used to see at the Cornell Theatre in Burbank (which has long ago been torn down). The 1st movie I watched was ""China 9 Liberty 37"", it stars Warren Oates and this Hottie name Jennie Agutter, it's about this Gunman who stops to visit Oates and and his wife, there's lots of chemistry between the vistor and the woman, and Warren senses it, he starts to beat her, she sticks a knife in his back, assumes he's dead, runs away with her new boyfriend, Oates recovers, forms a posse, tracks them down, takes the woman back, the gunman chases them to rescue her, a shootout breaks out! ..... and then the movie STOPS! and goes to the menu! IT DIDN'T FINISH! ... I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED! ... Also, every time you were about to see Jenny naked, the film is cut! ... I HATE THAT! ... I don't know if I want to invest the time in another story, only to be disappointed again!"
2,Spaghetti Western Collection (11pc),THE Quality Of DVD's Are very bad The picture are recorded from the orignal tv or original movie so the quality is very bad
2,Very Disappointed,"As a true die hard Spaghetti Western lover, I have seen many films that rightly should have never made it out of the Europe. After several reviews hailing this collection for a couple of rare but great movies, I was excited. Unfortunately, I sat through they entire set and never saw what other reviewer were raving about. The biggest issue is the quality of the film. Most are almost unwatchable. Buyer beware. You purchase at your own risk."

4,Excellent collection at great bargain price,"This is a wonderful collection of 44 western movies (in 11 discs). Though a few copies have slightly weak prints at certain places, with a wonderful collection of movies such as ""3 Bullets for Ringo"", ""And God Said To Cain"", ""Challenge to White Fang"", ""Death Rides a Horse"", "" The Deserter"", ""Find a Place to Die"", ""Grand Duel"", ""The Great Adventure"", ""Johnny Yuma"", ""Keoma"", ""Mannaja"", ""Minnesota Clay"", ""Run, Man, Run"", ""This Man Can't Die"", ""White Comanche"", ""White Fang and the Hunter"", this is a great pack for anyone interested in spaghetti westerns."
2,Ghost stories.,"This is some of the most famous stories that he has gathered. Famous writers like Poe, Dickens and Wilde... In my oppinion this book is just as many others of this sort. They have the almost the same stories in every book. And after some of them you get pretty tired of them. I didn't like it at all, but i Know that some of you will."
5,Train Ride,"No matter how you feel about abstract music, minimalist music, or whatever you want to call it, this work has the effect of pulling you in and making you listen. It is a wild ride on a train into infinity. For all its churning energy, it's breathless almost screeching syncopation, in the end it is about humanity."
2,Wish I'd spent more money for a better one...,"This is OK. I picked it up at Toys R Us when I got my daughter's new carseat for our new Subaru. In fairness, it does keep her feet off the back of my seat, but it never fits nicely against the seat back. It's always turning to one side or the other leaving a gap between it and the seat, sometimes even getting in her way when she tries to climb into the car. The string that ties around the back of the seat never far enough back on the driver seat, either.That pocket up at the top isn't very big. I never put anything in it because there aren't many things that would stay well. I can't recommend this product."
2,Rips easily!,"I purchased this for my new Envoy Denali which had shape similar enough to the seat protector for it to do its job. My daughter liked to rip her socks and shoes off to grab at the net bag with her toes. Within 2 or 3 days, she had this ripped. I will purchase another to try to flip the bag to the back. I like the black color which matches my leather seats. I rate it so low for quality of manufacturing although I am purchasing another today because there are so few options available."
4,Good for what it is,"I guess I can't say anything real bad about this item. I mainly have it so my son's muddy shoes won't ruin the back of my seat. It's great for that. The stringing that holds it to the seat could be a little different, but I'm not sure how....just seems not finished well for that part. Then again, no one sees it, so who cares! Other than that, the pockets are good and the material is sturdy and very easy to clean. I'm glad I got it."
1,Broke after 3 months of use-Bad Customer Service!!!,"The ties on this item broke off after only 3 months of use. Very cheaply made. I purchased this item at a Toys R US but could not return it without a receipt which I had misplaced. They wouldn't even do an even exchange...I tried calling the makers of this product directly (SunshineKids) which was a waste of time because although they have a one year warranty, you have to show proof of purchase. The only way to show proof of purchase is with a receipt. Well, things happen and sometimes you lose receipts which I did, so basically there is nothing that can be done. What a waste of $10 bucks as it is now headed for the trash can."
1,not enough room,"Not at all what I expected a lot smaller and not enough room for paper towels, tissues or anything else with any size to it."
2,Kinda disappointed,"I purchased this to protect the interior of my car, however I cannot get the bottom strings to tie around the seat. It basically just hangs there from the neck part. I wish they had a better attachment system than 2 strings at the base. Also, I have not been able to utilize the storage because of how it hangs."
4,Good & cheap,"It works good and was easy to install. The pocket is pretty small, but that's more of a bonus to not having a dirty seat, the main reason to buy the product!"
2,Wouldn't stay on,"This is a very cheaply made product, and wouldn't lie flat against the seat-- a corner would always stick up oddly. If I forced that corner down, the opposite corner would just pop up instead. I tied it in place possibly every conceivable way, but it kept coming untied at the bottom anyway, and would not stay still. You know that wire and thin material manufacturers use for things like pop-up tents and cheap hampers? This is like that. My 2-year-old seemed to think it was a fun game to try to kick it off.Anyway, I recently gave up and threw ours away. It was more trouble than it was worth."
2,Won't stay attached to the seat!,"I purchased two of these because my 21 month old has taken to kicking the seats while we're driving. However, within 1 hour he had removed the Stuff n Scuff. It doesn't fasten very well, so he was able to pull it right off. This item isn't worth the money. It just can't withstand the stregnth of a toddler."
3,"Good, but not held down enough...","Great concept, however even with the ties to hold it down, they're not very durable. Though it is def doing it's job and my 2 year old isn't ruining my leather seats! So far so, so good!"
3,Needs to be stronger,"Great concept and the mesh pocket is very handy. The product however, comes apart at the seams, and tears easily away from it's trim. I have gone through a few now because I liked the color and pocket, but will be trying another type."
3,"Stylish product, less than perfect","While I love the stylish look in my green kitchen, this ""Poly-Board"" is not anywhere near as durable as the acrylic one I replaced after 10 years. I used that so long and so hard the pebbles wore off, and it was smooth. It does not slip (as my acrylic did when it lost it's ""feet""), but I've had it for 3 months and it's covered with knife slices, which have stained (mildly), on both sides. Polyboard is too soft, and damages easily. Size is perfect, don't get the smaller one, but don't use sharp knives if you want to keep it as lovely as the day you bought it. One-year replacement warranty sounds good, limited Lifetime is questionable - but I haven't tried either, so I can't speak for Kitchenaid. They are a first class company, with quality products.2 Stars because of the knife cuts, with consequenting stains.4 Stars for looks and non-slippage.I had no adhesive problems - they must have fixed that after the complaints.Marianne, Toano, VA"
1,Buy this if you like glue.,I just received this cutting board. There was a label on each side attached with glue which hasn't come off yet after several minutes of scrubbing. I am very disappointed.
3,How to make *ANY* cutting board NON SLIP,"3 stars, 'cause I'm neutral on this cutting board.For those of you ""wowed"" by the non-slip factor or for those of you that find $$ for a polypropylene hunk 'o plastic too steep here's some words of advice.#1) Put a simple tea towel (kitchen towel) under your cutting board next time. Reduces both the noise _and_ the slippage.#2) Head down to your neighborhood tap plastics and buy pieces of polypropylene. Guess what? Same material...works just fine and well under half the price.My 2 cents."
3,Read review of RED version of this item,"I am considering buying this item - HOWEVER this ""glue issue"" is definitely cause to pause before purchasing. A review of this same item but in RED states that soaking the ""glue area"" in vegetable oil for about an hour - followed by wiping of course - removes the glue. Hope this helps anyone else considering the purchase. I give it three stars simply because I do not own it and am remaining neutral"
1,Don't buy this cutting board,"As the other posters have said, they're not kidding about that glue. Don't buy this board. It looks very nice, but after scrubbing with sponges, soaking in hot water overnight, putting it through the dishwasher a couple times, etc, I cannot remove 4 sticky wads of glue (two on each side). DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS THING."
5,Love It!,"Fantastic cutting board. Stable, doesn't slide around on the counter and if using for meat just throw in the dishwasher when you are done."
5,Don't read this on an empty stomach!,"I bought this book after reading Julia Child's glowing review of it... Ms. Simeti's narrative is engaging and witty, and most recipes are easy enough for a beginner to follow with great success. My favorite is the recipe for Caponata (Sweet & Sour Eggplant). The narrative is beautifully complemented by the prints and artwork used throughout and it is truly difficult to set this book down without first becoming ravenous."
4,"Oh, Yes - This Gets Us Closer","Having read every book by this author - I can recommend thiswork to anyone who'd like to know what it was like for ourancestors over the last 2500 yrs in Sicily. Within the pages, I found receipes that were handed down from my immigrant Girgentanograndmother, Gesuelda. (Sicilian for Jesus). My family history project is only 10 yrs old, but by reading this book and making the receipes, I have come close to feeling and tasting the foods my Grandparents and their anscestors shared during their life time. Mary Taylor-Simeti has given Sicilian Americans a huge gift by writing about our Siclian history. If you want to know and understand more about why you are the person you are, Simeti's book can help in that journey."
2,Too much going on,I just didn't love this book. The story was too convoluted. Too much going on. It was a disappointing read
3,"Slow, Tedious Over-Detailed Writing...But Read It Anyway","I really wanted to like this book...I really did. And it's not really that bad. DuBois grants us a very revealing look at his young life, along with his education and intellectual development. His early observations and analysis of life are insightful and thought provoking. Still his writing lacks pace and fails to flow in any way other than tediously. Despite being regarded by many as one of the great men of the 20th century, his memoirs grant little to convey that greatness and leaves the reader unfulfilled at truly grasping his many accomplishments. However, DuBois' revelations regarding the N.A.A.C.P. are very interesting, and one of the better parts of the book. If you have plenty of time to spare (it's over 400 pages long) you may attain more from it than this reviewer did."
2,Disappointing,"There are worthy moments on this CD, but mostly it's a disappointment. Godspeed You Black Emporer is more interesting, both texturally and structurally; this music tends too often towards pure minimalism, and in a very tedious way (straight 4/4 meter and descending minor scales). Also, the tracks with singing are very ill-advised; the vocalist sounds like he's trying for Wayne Coyne's goofy fragility, but with this music it just doesn't work."
5,just to reiterate....,"The reviews posted above perfectly reflect my own opions of this recording...so why write another review? Because maybe you (dear reader) need just one more bit of praise to convince you to spend! your hard-earned cash on this disc. It's awesome. If you do like GYBE! you will like this, but perhaps in a different way. The same feelings of despair with hope are here. Feelings I personally do not tire of."
1,really not worth it,"""Eric Musall"" hit it on the head: it sounds like Godspeed You Black Emperor minus the interesting parts. I'm sorry to say it, but this album is just boring. There are none of the gradual crescendoes of GYBE, or for that matter, anything much at all. Even without all the comparisons, The music of ASMZ is still ugly and souless."
1,Too bad to believe!,"My command of the English language is inadequate to accurately describe the complete lack of musicianship present on this disc. It's not somber or depressing or minimalist in nature, it's boring, bland, and inane. It fails to engage me at any level.I've been listening to indie for years and I despise anything pop so don't accuse me of only listening to accessible music. These days, I'm used to discs with one or two good songs and then a lot of filler, it's the nature of the beast. But this one has no redeeming value at all. This is truly the worst disc I own. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy for fear of insulting him or her."
5,GREAT presentation of material,"I cannot count the number of organizational change textbooks I have read in my life. No, I am not having a senior moment; it is just that none of my readings have been inspiring. Thus, none of them are memorable.Proehl's book ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE IN THE HUMAN SERVICES does not fit the standard mold. Proehl's writing is inspiring - almost to the point of being exciting. I believe she will be able to induce students to think more seriously about pursuing management and policy as an area of practice. Those students who do not pursue the macro path will have a greater appreciation for agency policy and management. In addition, clinical graduates who read Proehl's work will be able to effectively integrate macro concepts into their clinical repertoire.I am particularly impressed with her examples, use of measurement to address change, strategies for implementing change and most importantly - her writing. I highly recommend this book."
3,Wolf in Sheep skin,I dont know if these people just wrote reviews and never played or what. But this game is hard. I bought this game as a little time killer. Thinking this games target audience was kids it should be easy. Well its not. If you're looking for a challenge and like Zoids get this. If you're looking for a game to sit back and relax with this isn't it. You'd have a more relaxing time playing Resident Evil 2 only using your knife. Still a neat game through and through but I can't see non-Zoids fans getting into this.
4,a game master,"i only bought this game at first because i'm an anime fan, but i was pleased. The game has great graphics, and lots of action. You can customize your zoids, and in the zoids battler story line (blitz team, etc..) you purchase new zoids and parts. In the chaotic century like mission mode you are either republic or empire. You start of small, but with each mission you earn new and better parts. EAch type of mode has four save files, but they all go by very quick. Fortunately the battle mode you can infinately play over, but it will get boring. In the 2 player modes, you can load zoids from the battle missions. This game is very much worth the price, and you should by it."
1,an honest review from a zoids fan,"Zoids battle legends is a "" possibly"" good game buried under alot of garbage. i am a fan of the series and was excited about this game... then i played it. whats wrong you might ask? well lets see, first the controlls are sluggish and non responsive; this is a flaw that will frustrate any person. next is the degree of difficulty. I couldn't get past the first level in the tournement mode! It was so bad that me and my friend had contests to see who could last longer before losing. In closing to summerize my experience with this game: BEFORE I SOLD IT HAPPILY FOR 4 DOLLARS I WANTED TO TAKE THE CD OUT AND SNAP IT IN TWO! Save your money and avoid at all costs NO MATTER HOW HARDCORE OF A FAN YOU ARE"
5,AWSOME GAME!!!,if you want a game that has stragety fighting and fighting in a lion looking robot this is the game for you!!!
1,STINKS!!!,"This is one of the WORST games i have ever played. Slow controlling, bad sound, bad plot overall, bad everything. I tried to do republic mode, and i can't even get past the fifth lvl. The ONLY thing you do is maim eachother. The zoids you get are crappy, and very weak."
1,WARNING,"(...).THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE. Bad story, clunky controls, it is the absolute worst game I have ever played, and I have been forced to play a barbie game before."
5,very fun,"i find Zoids Battle legends very fun, battle mode is the most fun and its really easy if you sell all the zoids you begin with except the comand wolf then buy the blade liger (but make sure you are Bit and yoour partner is lena so its easy and you can get more $/BP.) Also if u want 2 be able 2 beat the harder battle mode save enough $/BP and buy Goldious Giga and buy the large pulse cannon and active camo for it.the mission mode is a pain because they expect you to beat a crud load of enemy zoids when your zoid sucks and u dont have any good weapons, but aside from that its fun and challanging.I strongly recamend that you buy this game if your a fan of the anime series."
4,Good game if your a fan,"I'm a huge fan of the TV show so this game was great to me, but I would not recommend if unless your a huge fan like me. The actual game play and graphics are great but the story plot and the voice actors are horrible."
5,WHAT A GREAT GAME,"I am a great Zoids fan, and I don't know why some people say this is a bad game. The graphics are excellent; the zoids look very real, and the option where to customize your own zoid is great. Just a warning to those who buy this game: in the battle mode you have to constantly view your partner's work."
4,OK.,Zoids battle legends might be cool for Americans who have never seen a decent anime game but I know better. I have all 3 of the zoids verses titles and zoids full metal clash. Compared to these games bl is like a -10it really is sad. I would recommend that all of you who want to get some serious anime games to go to play-asia .com and by a freeloader which will enable your cube to play all of the Japanese Zoids games you heart desires.
5,It might not come,well i love zoids as much as the next kid but this game might not come to the states although i have preordered this game atari (i tink it was) doesnt think it'll sell well. anyway i think they'll still ship it. >_< if they dont. well this game is going to be great it'll have tones of zoids to pick from and a story mode. if u want more info go to zoids gc and check out the music videos. they show the graphics and ways of gameplay (and the music's cool too ^_^).
3,Difficult but Cool,"Two-player mode (vs. or battle fist) is pretty fun, but going against computer players is not. I played battle mode (1 player) against a RED RHINO (I'm not to sure of the zoid's name, but that was what it was)! I barely had enough money to get a zoid and a few weapons, but it took me 5 times with the Rev Rator to be him! I do suggest you get this game, but don't get upset when you lose. If you do play battle mode, the Rev Rator is usually the best. BUT, if you want to be a Megola (the catterpillar zoid) you have to play battle mode and save."
5,AWSOME!,"You really need to know that if you buy this game,HAVE FUN!lots of zoids to choose from and plenty of stratgy(cunsult a walkthough for story and tornement mode tips its big help).I'd say to...READ THE BOOKLET IN THE CASE OR YOU WILL GET SO FRUSTERATED!I'd buy this if you are not a sore loser because its a bit hard at first."
2,meh its okay,This game is all i ever wanted. A real time game with zoids. I was a zoids fanatic about a year ago(yes im a kid) and this game is based on the series. The bad things? The controls are extremely hard to learn and mission mode is very hard since you take on many zoids at once with an ally part of the time(once or twice in the beggining). Sure its got great graphics and has many characters from the show but the voices are horrible. fiona sounds like a school girl on hielium!You can get this game but only if youre willing to play for hours before you start to get decent.
5,"Good game, but dont buy form overstock.com!!!!!","Mae govanen melon! This is one of the best games I've seen in a while, two player, over 50 Zoids to select from, and good story line on either the Rebublic or the Empire. OH, NO!!!! It comes out the 14th here even though it came out on the 7th at overstock.com. BUT, don't buy form them because it takes about 4 weeks to ship and then another 4 to reach it's destonation!!!! With that in mind if you order it here instead of a overstock you'll get it about 6 weeks earlier than there!! Choose wisely!!"
4,the b-o-m-b,this game is the best my friend is in japan and played it and it was tight liger zero and blade liger are my favs well gotta jet
3,It's an ok game,"I got this game because I loved the Zoids show when it was still playing on cartoon network. I have to ask, why did it take so long for this game to be released? It's obvious that this game is from a few years ago as the graphics, sound, frame rate, and just about everything else are sub-par. Not that these issues would keep me from playing it (I still enjoy a good game of Robotron) but come on. We could have easily had this game out when the show was still playing at least.The gameplay isn't so bad, but it really requires you to read the instruction book as there is no tutorial. (When was the last time I actually read the booklet for a game?? I think it was playing Age of Empires or SimCity!!)Overall its a bit disappointing. A good game for a Zoids fan but rent it, don't buy it."
4,This is a decent game.,This is a decent game. I mean it is good but it could have been better. It's not that it is bad or anything. They could have added some more modes like 2 vs. 2 or capture the flag or something. overall it's was better than i though it would be. It's a thumbs up! cya later. ^_^
5,Zoids: Battle Legends A must for Zoid Fans,"I personaly LOVE this game. The mission modes can get hard if yuo don't know how to control the zoid or modify it. This is actually Zoids VS 2 so you can pilot Liger X, the new ""Liger Zero Phoneix"" and so on. The only donw side to the game is there are NO cheat codes what so ever so you have to really work for Ultra Zi and otehr parts. Overall the game rocks and is much better then the game boy advance counter part. Graphix kick and the Saix is ALMOST 100% like the real then in its movement Atari really had it work cut out. I waited 3 years for the game and it's the soul reason I have a gamecube. This will surlly become a player's choice in time. Anyone will enjoy fighting with these Zoids."
3,Find another book withe analects of Confuscius,"This book does not have the complete set of analects, and what's worse; the author selected analects that seem to match the 64 trograms of the I ching.As an example.On page 86; the author lists trigram #36Then on page 87 lists the following analects 6:11, 14:32, 1:16, 2:17, 8:1, and 15:29.I would suggest that you leave this book alone, and buy a book with the full analects."
5,One of the Best Ever,As good as music gets. A rare jewel. This classic holds up year after year with the very best. The intelligence of the lyrics and musicianship is seldom matched. It's not hard to understand why George Martin wanted to produce this group. The fact that they never caught on says more about us than it does them. It will remain one of my all-time favorites and the standard by which I measure other albums. Seatrain and George Martin showed me what music could be...
4,At Last!!,At last! I found the album from Seatrain. I've been looking for years and I found it at Amazon.Willem from The Netherlands
5,Classic late 60's,"The Seatrain recording is still amazing after 40+ years. (Any Jewish connection will find two cuts in particular timeless and fascinating:) Marblehead Messenger merely a followup album w a couple of worthwhile cuts. I would never have seen Peter Rowan's country future from this recording but the ""country""vs""rock"" tension is definately in evidence, even more so in retrospect."
3,Half great,"The first CD in this set is great. I'm Willin' and 13 Questions and, perhaps one of my all time favorites, Creepin' Midnight are there.The group has more than mastered their parts, vocal and instrumental. They're tight and clear.But all the musical talant and skill that was brought to bear on Marblehead Messenger could not cover up lousy song writing. Nothing there captures my imagination.I don't regret buying the set because I adore most of the first CD and I'm very glad to have it. But, don't get your hopes up for the second CD."
1,Don't say you weren't warned,"Old enough to know has it right. This is not the original Seatrain from 1971 that we know and love. It is a re-recording that is no good, a poor reflection of the original, a major disappointment and a waste of time and money. If you can find the original, get it, otherwise don't bother."
4,un buen grupo de rock,"Tengo este Lp desde hace 28 años, y es uno de mis mejores lps. lo que pasa es que es España lo editaron sin la imformación de los musicos, que lo grabaron etc. Se que el grupo lo formaron antiguos musicos de BLUES PROJECT, por favor si alguien puede mandarme esa imformación, les estare muy agradecido."
1,"Run, don't walk away","1970's schlock pop at its worst. I heard the Orange Blossom Special track on satellite radio, decided to check them out. After reading reviews by the likes of jerseytomato, I thought how could I go wrong. Wasting twenty bucks is how I went wrong. There are MAYBE two or three songs on the whole of these two albums that didn't make me ill from being so saccharin and loaded with empty drivel. Maybe in fond memories of a 70's drug-induced haze someone can force themselves to believe this stuff is good. There's a reason these guys never made a big name for themselves. This one's ending up as a white elephant gift."
1,This one is a waste!,"Boy does this CD suck. After 2 listens, I remembered why I didn't buy the LPs when they were first releaded. They are both so inferior to the original SEATRAIN album released on A&M and now available on Edsel. The original band with Roy Blumenfeld, Donald Kretmar, Andy Kulberg, Richard Green and John Gregory on guitar and vocals was far superior. With Blumenfeld, Kretmar, and Gregory gone this band is less than average. Why they would remake Out Where The Hills, and As I Lay Losing is beyond me. My advice...if you want to know what SEATRAIN was really all about, get the Edsel CD and try to find The Blues Project -Planned Obsolescence which was the same band(Verve Forecast). I wish I could give minus stars for this one! Heck, I would give this away if there were any takers."
1,Garbage... I got suckered!!!,"I ordered the classic 5 star self-titled album 'Mashmakhan', and this junk album was recommened along side by Amazon. I figured they were of the same callibre, so I clicked on the 'order both' deal figuring I've scored big time. Well to put it short, this album sucks bad. Funny enough, the linear notes conveys such a surprise of the fact that this group never made a scratch on the surface of fame and recognition. Well this album couldn't highlight this point any stronger. Straight up wack and not even close to the funked out rock of Mashmakahn's debut album. Be leary of Amazon's recommendations, I think it's an sly way of pushing crap that can't sell along side stuff that does sell. A hard lesson learned!!"
2,a few good songs,"I bought this because I had to have Song of Job and it wasn't available on iTunes or any other CD. There are three or four songs on here I like: Song of Job, 13 Questions, Waiting for Elijah, and maybe one other that is at least listenable. I didn't even bother to copy the rest of it to my iPod. Just not my taste in music - but your mileage may vary, especially if you are a diehard Seatrain fan, which I'm not."
2,Maybe there's a reason they weren't big?,"Seriously, I bought this CD for only two tracks which I enjoyed in college (Story of Job & 13 Questions), but overall, most all of these tunes sound very dated and too similar to one another. The audio quality is mediocre (at least compared to many digitally remastered albums I have) and for this genre, The Band, did it better. Too much fiddle mixed up front. If you were a huge fan of Seatrain, you'll like two albums being squeezed onto one disk (makes sense as they never did any long jams on vinyl)."
2,Dancing around character developement,I'd like to know what the other reviewers read- because this book was neither compelling nor very entertaining. I found the writing to be just o.k. and the characters not compelling enough. This could have easily have been a novella instead of a short book. At times Marea the main character seemed self-destructive and not likeable. I just didn't like the unfinished feeling of the true intent of the story for Marea to find herself and figure out her fathers mysterious death that supposedly infulenced her past and somewhat current lifestyle. Also the sex in the book was illplaced and illneeded- it didn't help the book. If you are a Wenner fan then obviously you like her style and this book. This was my first and probably last time of reading this author.
3,Ultimate Training,Its basically the only one I found but a little pricey for what you get its a good product but learning from him you just get the feeling he's just a kid and not many strong motions its jus whatever considering its one of the only updated sai versions on the market.
4,Good movie for it's time.,"This is a classic movie from a time where movies were different. It's hokey at times, but over all it's worth watching."
3,Staid Black and White Movie,"The movie is filmed in black and white and has rather dark background colors, which gives it a gloomy appearance. The film is also a victim of the Hollywood censor: We are expected to believe that members of the crew, stripped to the waist, and able to engage in sexual intercourse with the Tahitian maidens at will, never exposed their navels to public view!!!"
3,"Hopelessly dated, fascinating never the less.","One thing to keep in mind when you view this film. Laughton plays Bligh as he REALLY was. Folks, this is not a characterization. Bligh was a great navigator, but a horrendously incompetent leader of men. He had no business being the captain of any ship, much less one that had to sail around the world. Where ever he went, mutinies followed him, culminating when, as governor of Australia, Bligh was thrown out of the country after a disastrous period of ""rule."""
3,Clark Gable?,"If this is the 1962 version of ""Mutiny"" it must be the Marlon Brando version and not the 1935 original that the synopsis suggests. This was filmed when Brando began to enjoy the fruits of his acting labors. In an era of tight white naval dress pants, he reportedly went through over 20 pairs due to tears from weight fluctuation. He began honing the behavior that characterized his later persona (difficult and odd) while on set and fathering the first of his children off it. In love with the location, he later bought an nearby island and married his co-star. All this attempt at contentment didn't help his performance or MGM for which he spent needless millions through countless retakes and bizarre demands.UPDATE Since written, Amazon has corrected the description"
2,Mutiny on the Bounty 1962 version better,"I wish they would release it in DVD, I saw the 3 versions.I prefer the 1962 version it's a lot better, can't wetto buy it (The DVD 1962) rate 4 1/2 stars.michel lebrunsherbrooke, qué."
2,A FAIR POTRAYL OF A NOTRIOUS MUTINY,"I would've liked to recommend this movie but I can not although CHARLES LAUGHTON and CLARK GABLE do outstanding jobs in thier roles. I found myself saying this why GLYNN CHIRISTIAN has never liked the way they potray the story about the mutiny and his ancestor. I felt that times this story went off the track of what it was trying to say, about what happend on that fateful voyage and why things turned out the way they did. This movie is'nt great by a historian's standpoint. Oh well if you like sea adventures you'll like this story but my advice is enjoy it and don't pay attention to the above or you'll be dissappointed like I was."
2,Dull Black-and-White Sea Voyage,"Filmed in 1935, this film is in black and white. The colorized version seems livelier, but there are several historical flaws. The most serious demonstrates how the film was caught up in the artifical morals of 1930's censorious Hollywood. For example, we are expected to believe that British sailors, impressed from the lowest levels of British society, and able to have sexual intercourse on demand with any of the Tahitian maidens, never exposed their navels to public view!"
5,Give this film an Oscar!!!,"This is one of my most favorite movies, mainly because my great grandfather directed it (Frank Lloyd). His direction was spectacular in this film. Charles Laughten played Captain Blight better than any recent actor has. This a superb black and white film. See it now!"
5,One touch Jar Opener,Best jar opener ever invented. especially good for people with arthritis.Retainer brite does a good job cleaning my sleep apenea retainer.
4,Mutiny Of The Truth,"Oh for the good old days when you could take a historical event and change it willy nilly in order to suit the story you want to tell. the real story of Mutiny On The Bounty is possibly more interesting than in the film, but to have the captain as the good guy didn't suit the times during the Depression when you were supposed to barrack for the underdog. But having said that and taking this film wholly as a work of fiction, it is a rolicking sea yarn full of whipping, chains, tropical islands, keehauling, evil ship captains, terrible storms, drownings, starvation and bravery.According to a newsreel that comes with this dvd, Mutiny On The Bounty was very expensive and it took about two years to make. The special effects are fantastic for the time and the acting, especially Laughton and Grable, but not excluding the others, is superb."
3,Inspired by a true story,"This is a very good film for its time, but the deviations from what is held to be fact in relation to the actual voyage of the Bounty are a problem.As mentioned in other reviews, Charles Laughton is excellent throughout the film and clearly the standout performance. However, deviation from historical fact, while it was actually based on a book with the same deviations, did bother me. The character of William Bligh was portrayed as excessively cruel, whereas Fletcher Christian probably should have been more villainous. In terms of historical accuracy, I do believe that The Bounty, made in 1984, is far superior. The accents of Gable and Tone were very American, which was out of place on a British ship. However, since this film is available for a small price, it is well worth a look, as is the 1962 version. The 1984 version with Anthony Hopkins and Mel Gibson is undoubtedly the best."
1,mutiny on the bounty blu-ray,WORST BLU-RAY TRANSFER I OWN. BLURRY AND FUZZY PICTURE. DID NOT EVEN TRY TO UPDATE PICTURE QUALITY. NO BETTER THAN REGULAR DVD.
5,I'd hate being in THIS Navy,"What more can I say about this classic film? It is simply one of the best sea epics and even more so because it's relatively factual about a brutal sea captain of the British Navy. The acting, direction, art direction are all excellent. While mutiny is usually not a good thing, the true story guides the viewer to understand why Mr. Christian felt that he had no choice. And for this choice, he and his crew were punished, not by the courts, but by themselves in a self imposed marooning in a desolate island. The film makes us feel the agony of land lovers being pressed into service on a naval ship and abused by a cruel and dishonest captain, until good men reached their breaking point."
5,Amazing Directory! concise but well laid out,"This is great if you need such a thing. It lists by zipcode, by city (all cities alphabetical, not by state!), and by area code. All cross reference each other as well. For example. Piscataway, NJ shows 08854 and 08855, area code 732 and can be looked up under each listing. Great Book!"
3,"Useful for some things, but didn't meet our needs","This book is clearly printed and easy to use if you know either a zip code or city name. It does have the benefit of including area codes & time zones as well. The area code lookups are particularly well done, but are not our primary need.We need to find the zip codes by physical region. ""Zip Code Atlas: The United States Mail Business Bible (United States Zip Code Atlas) (Spiral-bound)"" has maps of each state & metropolitan area; we find it much more useful for our needs. It mapped areas by 3 & 5 digit zip codes."
3,pity this is the best such reader available,"The editors have attempted to cram half a century of various scholarly musings on the written word, the uses of reading and literacy, the materiality and production of books, the reception and interpretation of meaning in books by readers and consumers, and the evolution of print culture into a couple hundred pages of really teeny tiny print. This has required creative editing and the use of FAR too many ellipses -- a number of important pieces are so gutted here that they're rendered almost meaningless, which is worse than frustrating. However, there is no other book available that provides the same kind of overview of the basic relevant literature on these subjects -- and the motivated reader, I hope, will search out the unabridged versions of those articles she finds interesting."
1,"Total waste... ""F"" bombs used alot in the DVD",Did not learn anything. Lots of foul language. Not a training DVD for sure.
1,The Cutting Edge- The Magic of Movie Editing,I don't know who would need to use this product. It has very little use information about cutting a film.The material is not for any students. Waste of time.
4,"4 1/2 stars but get this documentary as an extra on ""Bullitt""","Released in 2005, it is a well done inside look about the importance of the editor in filmmaking. Numerous editors are interviewed consistent with the movies they worked on. Nearly every top director is also in the film giving their insights into the editor's role. This doc is a must for anyone really interested in how motion pictures are made as well as showing snippets of some of the best movies ever made going back to the silent era.This doc is shot in high definition and is in Dolby Digital 5.1. Be sure to buy the ""Bullitt"" Blu ray or DVD rather than the stand alone package. It's cheaper and you get one of the best action movies ever made."
5,A good way to learn the craft,This film is a great way to see much of the work that goes into the editing side of movie making. From looking at what happens when bad edits are made to seeing Jim Cameron show what would happen if he just made 1 frame subtractions to shorten a movie. It covers many ways of editing from the do it yourself type at home to using Final Cut to make cold Mountain and being completely digital in production. a who's who of directors talking about their editors. A must own for anyone who aspires to make a movie.
4,Edgy and educational,"I have enjoyed showing this DVD to students that are interested in editing. It's educational AND edgy. Not rated for children though! It does have violent scenes, so be sure to watch it yourself before showing it to your audience."
4,Recommended for editing class,"This is a great introduction to what editors do to make movies. Film school, it's not. But it's a great overview of the evolution of editing. I used it in my beginning Final Cut class to introduce the students to the concept of editing and storytelling. Highly recommended."
4,"Excellent, informative, and entertaining",Great piece on the history and evolution of film editing. Invaluable short introduction to the importance of this process from some of the top filmmakers and editors.
1,An education in cheap toy making,"First, let me say that I waited decades for a Maya doll. Unfortunately, I had problems with Maya's boots as well. When I attempted to take the boot off her entire foot came with it. I was initially pleased when I noticed that the line was manufactured in India instead of China, but, wow, I have new respect for Chinese manufacturing. The entire line of toys are flimsy, which is a shame since there are some nice likenesses and costuming here. What should have been a dream come true for collectors is a sad disappointment."
3,"Okay, but not worth the price","Dana Hershman is joined by Terumi and Norbert in this workout. They're outside on the grass near the beach/oceanside of Hawaii and Terumi shows the modified version of each Pilates exercise. The background music is average/unobtrusive. The DVD is chaptered and you can choose from the section of breathing, the actual workout, relaxation and the bonus Pilates mat workout (filmed indoors with Dana alone and the workout is more advanced than the orginal one on the DVD).Dana cues both live and in voice-over throughout the DVD. The production value is mediocre. It's okay, but in my opinion, not worth the price. There are better Pilates media out there that are less expensive."
1,Jump back jets,"This game worked fine for about a day, then it woudn't load for play.I was really disappointed.I haven't had a chance to return it, it's been awhile since purchasing it.I hope I can.I really wanted to play it."
1,Did not work,"I tried 2 different disks, would not run. I am well within the minimum required. Tech support is pathetic. Avoid if you cant return it."
1,Won't run - and ZERO support,"This game looks great - it has a wide following of players with web sites and great tips and tricks. Unfortunately I can't get it to run on any of my three PC's! My primary PC is a Dell P4 with a GeForce 4 card - game runs intro and then pops back to Windows. Does the same on my secondary machine and my laptop. Go out to UBI's site, and guess what - they don't support this game anymore. Go out to a fan site... and find a list of many other gamers with the same problem, so it's a known bug that the developer just doesn't feel like fixing or supporting! So if you plan to get this game, good luck, MAYBE it will work for you. If not, don't expect support from the developer - they want you to buy the next version."
3,You Need A Good Computer,"I had 10x the system requirements but it loads as slow as a slug. My computer is a well-oiled machine. The FPS wasn't very impressive on a GeForce 4 Ti4200. Yet, the minimum is a Voodoo 2?? I was a bit disappointed. However, the simulation is quite good, and if you're a flight sim fan you will enjoy it. You just gotta have some sort of super-computer. If you don't, get Flanker 1.5 It's just as good if not better. Unless you need pretty graphics to be impressed by a flight sim."
5,Spiritual Genius is Genius,"""Spiritual Genius"" is Winifred Gallagher's insightful look at 10 people that are truly touched, or should I say in touch, with the highest, holiest power. Just by reading about these figures one feels more spiritually alert themselves. A great bonus was that I ended up learning a hearty amount of history and of the beliefs that make up today's most popular faiths, merely one of many benefits from Gallagher's interpretation of each ""spiritual geniuses"" path. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in spirituality, becoming a better person or wants to read a book about modern day religious figures that is also page turner."
1,kinda dry,Not much to really say about it. It was to dry to stay reading it. It took a while to get through it.
1,earrings,I thought these earrings would be much darker in color. the rose quartz was almost white therefore not showing up against the skin tone very well..they seem to dissappear on the ear.
4,Be The Change,"Since I am on a path to becoming my personal best I am always looking for practical support...Choose Peace and Happiness gave me that support. I enjoyed turning to a new, out-of-sequence chapter each week and applying the wisdom. Reeve's approach is applied common sense and wisdom. In our fast paced world, Choose Peace and Happiness is a breath of fresh air that everyone should be reading...believe me if we all began to apply these techniques, one week at a time this world would be a better place to live! Great Gift Book!"
3,Good for the basics,"I bought this book because it advertised Guitar Pro and Home Studio 2002...But it actually only covers Cakewalk Pro Audio 9 which isn't even available anymore. That's sorta annoying; but if you read along with the Pro Audio tips, theres a lot in common with what you would need for Guitar Pro and/or Home Studio. I kept it because like I said, it does help you tweak your system for the other programs; and it seems that all 3 programs are a lot alike.So in conclusion, it's not what I thought it was going to be, but it covers what I needed to know."
2,The information is a bit out of date,Since this book was kind of recommanded with Cakewalk's Home studio so I took it then learned that the Home Studio mentioned in this book isn't the same Home studio 2 product currently made by Cakewalk. Some information still applies but it'll take some mental exercise to filter out those no longer applies. If you are looking for current information on Cakewalk's product Home studio 2 then you need to look elsewhere.
3,Disappointed,"What spurred me to buy this book was the lack of guidance in Cakewalk Home Studio regarding the use of the Pitch Wheel. Being a newcomer to Sequencers, I needed this basic information.I was quite disappointed to find that Cakewalk Power didn't have much to offer in its one paragraph relating to the Pitch Wheel except to say that it was there.I just hope that the next item I'll need some assistance with from the book will be covered at least a little better."
1,ocaban1978,Item never worked. Tried new drivers still could not get it to work. It was not worth the trouble returning for the amount I paid. Using for fishing weight.
1,Need to fix the Description,It displayed as PCI E -Then described as PCI Ethernet (But you have to go to details)PCI E and PCI Ethernet is different that made the search result wrong/error.
4,Easy answers to all kinds of questions,"This book is great. It answers all kinds of questions, from beginner to more advanced subjects. I'm working on a project now, and it has saved my bacon 5 times already!"
1,Overabundant Dialog = Frustration!,"Wow, I got this book because of all the rave reviews, but I am very disappointed in its content. The problem with this book is, the questions are not the type of questions your going to ask someone unless you need a lot of help using your computer. But that's not the biggest problem I have with the book. The Major Disappointment with this book is 75% of the book is Fiction. The book is written with the Author receiving calls on a Fictitious TV Talk show. Ultimatly I was expecting it to be like a VB6 FAQ, but it in no way resembles that. This Book gets Zero Stars! Paul Sheriff Teaches Visual Basic 6 (762 Pages) is the same price, and best of all, there is no Fiction."
2,Don't bother,The book is basically a dialogue from the author's class on visual basic databases. I found this writing style to be very annoying and not easy to follow. The whole book is centered around one project and presents a narrow viewpoint rather than the more comprehensive approach to database design I was looking for.
1,This is the worst VB book you can buy!,"I flipped through this book at the bookstore and I saw someexamples of problems that I have run into in the past, so I bought thebook. That was a big mistake. This book is supposed to be based on a TV talk show that doesn't exist, where the callers call in and ask questions. You could take the 485 pages of this book, rip out all the stupid fake dialogue and have a small FAQ but I wouldn't dare charge someone for that information. The book is awful. The writing is terrible. The concept is miserable. The questions are beyond easy. Leave this one on the bookshelf."
1,The weirdest Computer book ever!,This book is so stupid! I don't understand how this book got 4.5 stars? Most of the book is not even about programing!? Its like a novel!
1,The book was ok,Some useful information. My complaint is it took so long for the publisher to ship the books out.
1,This Book Isn't Good,"Hi, i got the book to enforce my knowledge about Vb and Databases. People PLEASE DO ME A FAV AND DON'T buy this book"
5,Learn to Program with Visual Basic - Examples,This book is a must for you if you are serious about learning Visual Basic. Dr Smiley's books are well-written. He makes them interesting and fun to learn. Highly recommended.
1,incorrect product,vender sent me wrong product. not to happy with the service or the reply i had receive from this particular vender.
5,stephen king yay!,"My family was looking to watch ""IT"" on netflix and no success in finding it. So I went on amazon and found it for sale and a good price. It arrived as quoted and my family was excited to watch it. Good quality product."
3,Good for passing the time on a road trip.,I listened to this while on a road trip. It's good for passing the time.
4,Things aren't always what they seem to be,"The author goes into detail about growing up in Washington, DC and then talks about her relationship with her African husband and the other relationships that women and men have formed with Africans. Her marriage at most, was turbulent due to patriarchal customs. She befriended a woman in Nigeria who was an African-American married to a Nigerian who was barren and treated as an outcast by his family and him. Marita has heard from this woman that women have left their husbands not even requesting for their things that they have left behind. The author thought that because she was marrying an African, she would have been treated better. Sadly, she learned that a man is a man, no matter what ethnic origin he is."
3,Interesting read,Long Way Back to the River Kwai. A very interesting tale of a harrowing experience. The author was lucky to survive such an ordeal.
3,kattywatty,Not a bad book ...but something should be done about the editing. Lots of run together words...hope they didn't pay to much to have this done. The story was good..but a lot of things made no sense..like he really liked this one singer (at the camp?) who played the piano? Was the piano in the camp? I don't know. The last part of the book that seemed to go on forever tells of his life after being interned. Seemed he went all over..but what he was looking for was the Japanese race to say they were sorry. Never happened. I found this part of the book very boring. Ok to read but don't expect to much.
3,An interesting read.,"My father was a POW in Burma and I read this book hoping to understand the kinds of experiences he went through. He never talked about those horrible days (and years) and now I understand why. Although this book was from the viewpoint of someone from a different culture and country, it did not negate the fact that what my dad, and all these men and women suffered was horrendous. I now have a better picture of the time. My thanks to all the men who served, suffered and died for my right to live free today."
5,A moving memoir from a unique perspective,"This book is particularly interesting because its author is Dutch and Jewish, and he brings a different perspective to his story than is found in the memoirs of American and British WWII POW's. Moreover, he is a very thoughtful, introspective person. He has spent much of his post-war life working with Japanese businessmen, and the last part of the book describes his attempts to reconcile the horrors of his WWII experience with the ""collective amnesia"" of contemporary Japanese society. I found this memoir moving and thought-provoking, and that's a winning combination."
4,"Gut-wrenching, but worth it","Those who have seen ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" will notice a lot of similarities, and with good reason. But what you didn't see in the movie are the absolutely barbaric conditions in which these prisoners lived. The descriptions of their sicknesses and wounds and the nearly complete lack of care for them is tough to read, but important when trying to understand the author's attitude toward the Japanese, even long after the war. Not an easy read, but a worthwhile one."
3,Interesting personal account,"My grandfather was a POW in Burma and came back with stories that make you shudder and I bought this book to see if there was more I could learn. Although there is preamble on how Velmans escaped from the Netherlands and then moved to Indonesia and his life after the war, the account of treatment by the Japanese and working on the Burma railroad is quite insightful. There is not much on what happened to the Japanese after the war (war crimes) and Velmans does not really give you his opinion of the treatment he received. However, as a personal account, it is an interesting book."
4,love the shampoo not the price,"My sister who has had chemo was told by her hairdresser to try this shampoo and she told me to try it. I tried all the pureology sites and found that Amazon had the best for me. By the time you add sales tax and shipping it gets very pricey. It is by far the best shampoo and conditioner I have used and I have tried all the salon brands. I have a short bob which tends to wave but with these products there is no frizz and it stays straight. I gave it four stars because of the price, not Amazons price just the general price of the product."
3,Conditioner,Conditioner works well but the peppermint smell is overpowering and very difficult to remove by rinsing.
3,Sometimes expensive is not always better!,"For my highlighted curly hair,this product was not the answer I was looking for. It might be great for someone else, just not me. I needed additional products in my hair after using all the Pureology products(shampoo,conditioner and spray)as suggested to calm down the frizz."
3,Sam Balon Rides Again,"Johnstone has found a formula which works for him. He has written a series of books in which: 1. The Devil uses sex to take control of a community. 2. God's warrior (Sam Balon in various incarnations) fights the Devil. 3. Lots of people get killed, raped, tortured, turned into zombies, turned into vampires. 4. Big Battle.Johnstone's discriptions of ""arguments"" between God and the Archangel Michael may irritate thoghtful Christian readers. If you like lots of violence and some graphic sex, you will give the book a fairly high rating. If you are a stickler for logic and theological consistency, you will give it one or two stars."
2,Rather Disappointed,"After the first two installation's of William W. Johnstone's horror series(The Devil's Kiss and the Devil's Heart), I was rather disappointed in the developments, or lack of, in The Devil's Touch... The story was very loosely put together, especially towards the end, where it seemed as if the author was just trying to finish the book.... In all honesty, if one were to read this series and leave this one out.. they wouldn't be missing much.... BOTTOM LINE: Serious drop off from ""The Devil's Heart"", which was by far the best of the first three books."
2,Not what i expected!!,"I have also read the devils kiss and the devils heart and found this book to lack the true intent of the writer.. based on his earlier books. The first two gave you characters to follow and an interesting dialogue.. while it seems the author kind of broke away.. and turned completely to sex, ghouls, and shock this time. What happened?? I think the author was most likely rushed to finish since the publishing is only a year apart.My opinion.. just stick with the first two and leave this one out."
4,Great Dub!,if you like dub. I for my part would like to have some more lyrics. On this cd you will hardly find one. I guess this is just because this is a dub cd. But the rhythms and sounds are great.
3,Ok,"This was a good purchase, fast shipper and am glad that I purchased, but should not have to write so many words"
4,David Hasselhoff is musical magic personified,David Hasselhoff is musical magic personified. This album just proves that he can do much more than just act. It's hard to believe that so many people in America have overlooked Hasselhoff's musical talents. Probably the most exciting track on this album is the Night Rocker [Extended Blaster-Mix]. The first time I heard this song I fell in love with it. I probably played it 20 times over and over again. I just close my eyes and dream of being behind the wheels of KITT from the TV show Knight Rider. I can smell burning rubber with the wind blowing in my 80's feathered chest hair while gently touching the turbo boost. Hasselhoff really knows how to capture the emotions of love and excitement in song.
4,Zoids Legacy,"How much fun is Zoids Legacy? Depending on your interest in Zoids, it most definitely will be fun. It starts you off as a beginner Zoids pilot, as any normal game would. As you progress through the game you will be able to purchase better Zoids, better weapons, and upgrade items. It takes a little while to beat the game, but as you go from one time period to the next on the game, it will get more challenging. The final battle you have to beat......well, you have to play the game for yourself to find out."
4,Even though I don't generally like jazz vocals . . .,". . . I've got to make an exception for Dwight Trible. With an Andy Bey-ish delivery and extraordinary vocal control, Trible, sporting a rich baritone, is the real deal. Combine his rare vocal talent with very tasty and understated instrumental accompaniment, and you have a disc to be contended with.If you're like me and don't particularly like jazz vocal, I suggest you think of his voice as an instrument of uncommon emotional range and precision, not paying attention to the lyrics, which, though serviceable, seldom reach anything approaching profundity. If you are predisposed to vocal jazz, you will hardly find a more accomplished singer than Dwight Trible. In either case, you win.Recommended. ****1/2"
5,Inspiring!,"I've been a fan of Dwight's for a while now and I love this CD. His voice is beautiful on its own, but with the masterful music arrangements behind him these songs can't be beat. He has surrounded himself with some of the best musicians (Daniel Bejarano on drums must be mentioned). You need to check out his cover of ""Little Sunflower"" and his tribute song to John Coltrane. The overall artistry of the music makes this CD a MUST purchase."
5,Just as I remembered!,"I read this book when it was first released in the 1970's. When I saw it was out on Kindle, I grabbed a copy. I love Coffman's Moura series. This book was/is my favorite of them all. Mark is wonderful and Anne is great, both of them are so suited to each other. If you want an historical gothic tale, then this book is one to read!"
1,Barely Functions,"I bought these for my kids.Brand new alkaline batteries last only long enough to take 5 or 6 pictures. When I take the battery out after it dies, it is *hot*.The camera has to pull open to use, but it is so stiff my 9 year could not do it until I worked on it and put wax on to keep the plastic from binding.The pictures are ok, but I don't expect the kids will ever use them. Every time they try, the battery is dead again.A real disappointment."
4,great photographic effects,"If you aren't aware of the type of picture this camera takes search on flickr and you will see the beautiful colors and effects this camera produces. I'd like to give itfive stars but it has a drawback. You have to do one of the numerous mods tokeep it from eating batteries or take the battery out when not in use.I keep one in my pocket at all times and an extra rechargeable battery. Use only rechargeable batteries. My only other criticism is it's so tiny that I like more inmy hand when taking pictures but it is designed to be a small camera. I'm planningon making a bigger frame for it that will also hold more batteries.It's not a child's camera, it's for serious photography. You'd have to pay a lot ofmoney to buy an expensive camera that would give you the same effects as a Vistaquest."
1,It Broke the 2nd Time I used it!,"This is a piece of junk. Not only does it not work, but the second time I tried to use it the pivit attachment parted."
5,Terrific resource,"I have enjoyed the benefits of yoga for several years, guided by excellent teachers. After moving to a new city, I found that I was ready to pass on some of what I know, by starting to teach. This book has been a terrific find -- reminding me to look with fresh eyes at things that I had once learned in class or in workshops which had since become ""automatic"". I found the writing, illustrations and photographs clear and useful, with enough detail to support good practice. The examples of ""misaligned forms"" are also wonderfully clear for the novice -- with a colleague or a mirror, an independent student could make good and safe progress. It is a valuable complement to the other books on my Yoga shelf."
2,Out dated but works,This book feels and looks a little out dated. It serves it purpose - demonstrating yoga poses but your money can be better spent on less expensive and/or more updated books.
1,you don't have a button to click on to hear her!!!,Website is messed up. I want to hear her but there is NO BUTTON to hear her SAMPLES FROM CD. FIX THIS AND I can write a real review.
2,Cheesy!,Its OK for the price! Was expecting to actually be able to see outside at night with it. Its great inside only
1,The cool dog,First of all this product shows a bright light so people see u before you see them so in that manner it doesnt work and I would recommend to just upgrade and get the nicer ones
2,"misleading title, really just a flashlight","This is just a red flashlight, it is very small and too childish for my stepson who is 9. Title of this product was misleading."
3,light,"This is a red light which shines pretty far, not as far as a lazer light but pretty good anyway."
1,Why do they even call it a toy?,"I purchases this item which I refuse to call it a toy, looking at the very positive reviews at Amazon and I am very disappointed. There is absolutely nothing of a 'spy' factor in this thing and all it has is a red LED which lights up at the push of a button. You can not view anything in the view finder and it has no magnification at all. I really don't know how come this product came up with such a good reviews so far. The bottom line is that I bought this for my nephew and I don't think i will give him now that I have seen it. There is no cool factor in it. I understand I would not expect much in this price range but its really worth nothing - just a red LED!"
3,Nice buy,"We purchased this for our 5 year old along with the spy goggles. He immensely enjoyed both. As a matter of fact, the adults were quite taken with it too!"
3,Nightspyer,I boight this for my 11 year old brother. I did not realize when i bought it that the reason it makes you see at night is a red light. I was somewhat disappointed in this because it is meant for younger children and in the description it sounded more high tech.
2,Miss Julia is a wimp,"This book made me angry. Very angry. I don't like people who let themselves be victimized and thats exactly what Miss Julia did. After the rather incestuous first book, this book was just another disappointment. I had had high hopes for this trilogy. Happily, though, the third and final book, Meridon, has a genuine, strong female lead instead of either a crazy, plotting witch, or a pathetic, weak country miss. Jst skip this one and read Meridon."
2,unlikable,"The one fatal flaw in this book is its characters, ecspecially richard. What drove me to hate the novel was that the one bad guy, who i hated from the very first pages of the book, consistently got away with his evil deeds without being punished or killed until the end. I don't mind telling this audience that he dies...all though potentially good the author made me hate it. In my opinion an author is able to make the reader dislike a character for a short period of time, but for a novel as long as this one, a character cannot be despised as much as richard is for the whole novel without driving the reader insane, and as in my case does not drive the reader to totally and utterly disliking the book."
1,Gregory Disappoints Once Again,"What I find so troubling about many of Gregory's books is her failure to present a heroine who isn't insipidly weak. This book, ""The Favored Child,"" and ""The Virgin's Lover"" both spring to mind. ""The Favored Child"" had great potential in terms of Gregory's beautiful writing, but Julia's consistent inability to stand up to Richard ruined the book for me. I found the characters neither realistic nor sympathetic. After 400 pages of drama, I quickly flipped to the last page and read Julia's letter to James. I immediately threw the book down because I was so disgusted. I would ask Gregory to write a book where the heroine actually has a backbone.I understand that the modern mindset greatly colors my thinking when it comes to a woman's role in society, but no one expects that degree of historical accuracy from 'pleasure' reading such as this.I'll throw one bone to Gregory - her descriptions of Bath were marvelous."
3,Just Ok,This book was better than the first. I don't hate either of the books and I dont regret reading them but the first ones sexual content is disturbing. The fact that in each book the charactes get more and more inbred and that the author tends to write hundreds of pages of nothing tends to bring the story down. The book is not horrible but I was disappointed.
3,author may have exhausted the subject,"While I had to finish it, this book was just not up to par with either the ""Other Boleyn Girl"" trilogy, or Wideacre. Its just not believable in places. The characters cannot be reacting the way they do, which makes the story hard to swallow. Slow in the beginning, picks up around page 300. And thats too late for me. Now, I am not sure I want to read the third in this trilogy"
3,Eh was OK,"I cant say it was a great read, was entertaining up to a point. Not one of her best books. Very predictable and the story plot was to depressing for me."
4,Addictively Infuriating!!!,"I have become a fast fan of Philippa Gregory, starting first with The Other Boleyn Girl before beginning the Wideacre trilogy. I cannot put them down. In this second work I find myself sad for Julia Lacey but infuriated with her at the same time. I want to jump into the book and strangle her for her stupidity and weakness but then check myself on the time which her character lives. You cannot help but pity little Julia and hope that she will summon the strength of her mama/aunt Beatrice, the Wideacre witch, and break from the intolerably cruel rule of her cousin/brother/husband Richard and give him his just desserts. I cannot wait to learn how it all ends. This trilogy makes great summer reading. A MUST READ!!!"
3,Interesting Sequel,"I LOVED the Wideacre book - I was prepared to love this one. I enjoyed the interesting story, but I hated all the characters except Ralph and James (secondary at the most). My biggest issue with this book, however, is the glaring discrepancy that we are told on the first line of the first paragraph of the first chapter that Julia lives to be an old woman and is telling this story as an old woman far removed from these memories. We find at the end of the book *spoiler alert* and in the middle of Meridon that Julia dies soon after giving birth. At the ripe old age of - 17 or 18?I do not like sloppy writing such as this. If this was meant figuratively - it should have been clearly stated. I read the entire book ""knowing"" that Julia would live long. I was frankly angry to find her killed off. ""I am an old woman."" That was unfair to readers."
2,BLECH!!!,"It's bad.It's painful to read.I think Gregory enjoys torturing her characters a little TOO much.I read pretty well until about page 450 or so, but I just couldn't take it anymore. I skimmed the rest. I HAD to see what happened but I didn't want to actually READ it."
4,The Favored Child,"This is the second book in the Wideacre series and follows Beatrice's daughter, Julia. Out of Beatrice's two incestuous children, Julia inherits her 'good' side (in tune with the land and a natural with animals) whereas her son Richard encompasses Beatrice's worst traits. The Favored Child lacks the eery, shocking, almost disturbing quality of Wideacre, and the more lively (and likable) characters of Meridon. However, I didn't regret reading it- it still has the typical Gregory descriptions and historical traits, and is not a boring story."
3,Where is the Kindle Version?,"I am a huge fan of Phillipa Gregory, but I am also very disappointed that many of her books are missing from the electronic version. Particularly, the Wideacre Trilogy has the first and the last books in the Kindle version, but where is The Favoured Child? I'm not sure is this is an issue with the publisher or with amazon... but seriously, guys, get it together. You don't publish a trilogy in the wrong order... even if it is electronic."
3,historical novel,"I don't think I'd recommend this series - too lengthy and too unpleasant and not enough real history. Somewhat interesting but not totally satisfying. Ending OK but not great. This series is strange, but probably believable for that time period."
2,She loved him??????,"I bought this book because I had read and enjoyed some of Phillipa Gregory's historical novels. This one did not fill the bill for me. As a supposedly independent-thinking woman of spirit, I found Julia to be incredibly naive. Love is not an emotion that any female could possibly feel after being raped - especially after suffering abuse since childhood at the hands of her brother / playmate / husband. I found her characters to be either psychotic or dazed by all that laudunam (sp) they took. After reading THE FAVORED CHILD, I have no desire to read the first or the third in this trilogy."
1,Her worst book so far!!,"Have read Gregory for years. This is by far the worst one by her. The climax was vile in nature, not to mention the hard to swallow reading of Julia's abuse, time and time again. After reading the ending, not only would you want to slap her silly, you'd want throw her off a river too!.This is definitely one book that I would not recommend reading."
2,Quite Annoying,"I'm not one to place a book down, especially after reading more than half of it. But after reading page after page, waiting for this intelligent yet ridiculously stupid girl to wake up and realize what's going on, it's a bit annoying. Save yourself and don't even START the series. It kind of sucks you in, making you read all the novels even though you know you'll regret it."
1,A Downer,"After enjoying the first novel in this series I was really looking forward to this sequel. It started out pretty well but soon went downhill. The plot is barely believable and the ""woe is me"" and handwringing gets old. I don't think I'll even bother with the third book - wish I hadn't already bought it."
4,Loving and Hating,"This book has many twists and turns in the book. There is a lot of irony and sinful secrets. It has a great plot although Richard, the male antagonist of the book, was so hateful and evil. I really despised how he treated and stole away Julia's life. He toyed with her feelings and destroyed everything she worked for. Julia has a lot of flaws, but in the end she always wanted to make everything right. Personally, this book made me cry and felt miserable but at the same time loved the book.If you love English history, and the difference between social class, I assure you that you would find this a unique and hard-to-put down novel."
1,NOT WORTH IT!,"I liked the 32 ounce capacity and that was about it. The pump was defective and the replacement was also of poor quality. The stainless steel rusted super easy. Don't waste your time! I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and purchased a pump/scrubber holder all in one. I am satisfied although I do wish it had a larger capacity. PS I only gave it 1 star because it wouldn't allow me to give it 0 stars. It did ship fast and the replacement too, but again, it's totally not worth it."
1,No Go,This product does not work. It did not work from the beginning and it was a complete waste of money.
4,"cool, but kinda freaky","This game is really cool, considering the guns and gadgets, but 1: It's too hard, 2: you have to remember the passwords because you can't save, and 3:when you die, it says ""you're terminated""and shows your robotic head, all bloody, rusted, and stuff. but most freakiest part is your bloody red eye. It scared my friend out of his wits! Other than that, this is a greatt game, and I recomend it for people who like adventure, sweat, and bravery."
4,like it,this really make u dance so much so fast. what a master of music. love this so much. great stuff
3,not as good as i thought,There are some sophomoric songs and I like will Smith but I wish he would have stuck more to either his music or acting. most of the songs are from a film - not so hot
2,Too Few Songs,"I assumed this product was Mr. Smith's discography -- clearly, all of his songs can be considered his ""greatest hits."" I was disappointed to find that this album only included a few of his tracks. How someone could make the argument that Big Willie style doesn't belong in the set of Will Smith's greatest hits is beyond me."
3,Would be 4 stars if...,"it had ""He's the DJ, I'm the Rapper"". Seriously folks, that old-school number is one of DJ Jazzy Jeff And the Fresh Prince's best. But I guess since this is just the best of Will Smith it was left off. Oh well."
5,What people don't give Will credit for...,"that he gave a real boost to rap music because he is the one who got all types of people to listen to him, maybe because they had watched him on TV, but whatever the reason, not enough credit is given to this super-star, multi-talented man who sings for everyone to enjoy, and while being street-smart is constantly funny and seems to know how to sing a song for everyone to enjoy. Believe me, I am an ""older"" middle class white woman who listens to his music and thinks he is the greatest and respect him for staying clean while many other artists have not. Thank you, Mr. Smith, for giving us great music and talented movies that are enjoyed over and over again."
4,The Definitive Will Smith Collection,"Will Smith isn't one of the greatest lyricists of all time, but he has made some noteworthy hits, and you can find them all here. From his early hits like ""Parents Just Don't Understand"" and the laidback ""Summertime"", to his biggest hits ""Miami"" and ""Gettin' Jiggy With It"", and even his soundtrack efforts ""Wild Wild West"", ""Men In Black"", ""Nod Ya Head"", it is a perfect Will Smith compilation. If you want to add this artist to your collection, look no further."
4,I love it!,"Normally, I despise rap because most the rap I've been exposed to glorifies gang membership, violent crimes, and killing police officers, but Will Smith and a few others make the rap genre look better with their music. I remember how I used to crack up laughing at the song 'Parents Just Don't Understand' as a twelve year old, and the other songs are great as well. I say my favorites are 'PJDU' and 'Just the 2 Of US'. The only complaint I have about the album is the exclusion of the song about fighting Mike Tyson. But if you're looking for a CD that's infectious and fun to listen to, you definitely want this one."
4,you gotta love will to buy this one,includes some of will smith's biggest hits solo and with former partner dj jazzy jeff includes his new hit with wifey jada pinkett singing personally she should stick to the big screen.
2,Greatest Hits,"Will Smith's lyrics are comical. But if you listen to then too much, and you already know the punch line and all the words, then your left listening to it for the beats and flows. These cuts are on the lower end of the smoothness meter for Smith songs.If you've never had a Will Smith CD and you want one, get this CD. But if you want nice flowing CD get ""And In This Corner..."" by Jazzy Jeff and Smith instead."
2,Better Stuff with Jazzy Jeff,Will Smith re-invented Himself as a solo Artist but basically played it Safe.He has a Ok Flow&isn't the Worst MC but His Material after a while gets to predictable&He got to Watered-down for His Own Good as a Solo Artist.Jazzy Jeff balanced Him out.
5,Will Smith for Quantum Learning,I ordered this CD to use with Quantum Learning. It is good because the language is acceptable for most students.
1,Will Smiths worst hits,I think the best song on this CD is Miami. That's my opinion. I guess I'm not a true Will Smith fan. I like his movies better. I'm just not into the rap music.
1,very disappointed,"this product came very late. it was supposed to come by February 27, which was already a very late date for it to be received. Then i did not recieve it until March 6. I contacted the company and they told me that they were not even able to track it. i would never order anything from this company again. it came from the UK."
2,THIS IS NOT RAP PEOPLE.,This compilation is weak because it has only 2 good songs and the rest are all crap.Will smith is not a rapper but tries to convince you because he already is famous for being a movie star.I would not recommend anyone to buy this cd.
5,Will Smith - Greatest Singer of Men in Black,"This CD was making me so excited tonight, just listening to the songs and playing them over and over, can't get enough. Will Smith is a legend and I have been looking for this CD for 10 years, but never thought I could get it on Amazon. I will treasure it forever, my favourite music of all time. It is so cool, sexy and you can actually hear the words he sings, unlike other artists. Men in Black is a supreme example of what high end music should be, you can dance and listen, the real people would relate to it, I am sure. He is a true star and an amazingly talented vocalist."
3,it's ok...,"The collocations are decontextualized, and are presented in a way that serves to introduce the notion of collocations more than to help build a stronger lexicon with frequently occuring colocations."
5,Fabulous read-aloud,"It's a real shame that this book is out of print. It has magic and fairies, a fabulous, flawed hero, a great sense of humor, and you get to read it aloud with a brogue. My five-year-old was mesmerized."
4,Good live band,"Haven't listened to the CD yet, but I've seen these guys in concert around Cleveland. They put on a hell of a show, and feature good, well-written songs with good pop hooks. Their songs ""Whiskey and Wine"" and ""Eddie Casino"" are real crowd-pleasers, and usually everyone gets singing along to the chorus."
2,Shed your own Light....,"The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are a simple, clear series of aphorisms designed to help a person realize that the human mind is controllable.I read a portion of them daily. This famous yoga author proves that too many words can muddy even the clearest water.As Patanjali himself said, ""There is knowledge of everything through intuition"".I feel there are too many books written on ""how to"" understand spiritualteachings, and that this is another one.There are many translations of the Sutras available. Buy one, and if, after reading it, you need someone elses opinion, buy this book."
1,not the same edition I received,"As you can see from the picture, this edition is not the one I received. That was a disappointment."
4,Good info,I got this for my husband because he likes to learn how to grow all kinds of things and he likes it a lot. I wish it was legal to grow so we could actually try out some of the things in the book. We received it a few days ago and he has already finished it! He says it was easy reading and helpful for the future when it is legal here!
4,good but needs more photo's,"The book has a lot of good info, but the author did'nt have to many color photos to follow along with and they keep you hopeing that yours will be just like that, he has some drawings of various grow situations and machines ,, It does cover from the experienced to the begginer it does go good with the other one Jorge 's Horticulture book, between the two you should at least have a better than average start...Peace, Sugo"
2,nothing new,"if you want detailed information and reference, this is not the book. nothing different then the other books. i wish a bought another one."
4,Still a fun read,"I read this book back when I was in sixth grade, and a few months ago I read it aloud to my little sister. It is still one of my favorite books. Full of action and description... very easy to get into."
3,"Story line is great, but the writing isn't.","This book has a fascinating story line which lets the reader view the parallel lives of two 14-year-olds from very different times. However, the writing itself is not up to what the author did in ""The Monument."" Sentences are sometimes too long and rambling, other times too short. Also, the main character manages to run about 70 miles across the desert in a day and a half... something that seems not very realistic, at least to this reader."
2,Canyons,"Canyons is an interesting book. It is about Brennan, a boy who lives with his mother. His father left the family when he was very young, and he has never forgiven him. Brennan liked to run around to free himself from all the problems he was going through. One day, Brennan went camping accompanied by Bill, his mother, and some children. It was then that Brennan found a skull. Later on, he realized that couldn't talk about the skull and somehow he felt attached to it..."
1,Worst book I ever read.,"I read this book for a school project, and I found it disappointing. It took a day and a half to read, there was hardly any plot, and the ending was mundane. This book will get you bored in 3 minutes because of the lack of entertainment and quality. Just don't buy this book, it's a total waste of time and money."
1,Chanel's Opinion,This is a fairly decent book. It is about two boys but the author hardly talks bout Coyote Runs. In this story it talks about Brennon going camping up in the Canyons. It is a decent part of the book but it really doesn't give any giggles or smiles. It's not romantic or mysterious its just a typical plain story. Towards the end it kind of jump to excitment but that's the only reason I give it a won because it starts to have some stuff that gets you interesting in the book. Brennon goes off and sleeps away from he people he was camping with and walks up sleeping on Coyote Run's skull. He got murdered during a raid that he always had wanted because he always wanted to be mroe manly. This is my opinion and I dont know how other readers would judge this book so I just wanted to give the future readers a breif descripition of the book. Thank You Very Much and Stay True!
3,"Give thise book a chance, and it will pull you in!","This book is about an Apache boy who was on his way in becoming a man, but was killed. About 100 years later, a boy around his own age named Brennan was camping in the same canyon, where he was killed. The Indian spirit then begins to hount Brennan, and he becomes obsessed in finding out what happend to the Apache boy. In the prosses they become freinds and they both help each other out. I think thise was a good book. It kept me in suspence, and it made me just want to keep reading on. Because of how it wouldn't tell exactly how the boy was exactly killed at first. This is a good book if you like susspence, and are interested in how a relationship was formed between two boys about 100 years apart."
5,My mom likes it,"I got this for my mom, and she really likes the music from the movie. Moms happy, so Im happy."
2,A big disappointment,"When I saw the movie what drew my attention was that in some cabaret scenes French music was heard with a singer and a band performing wonderful songs in early 1950's style that helped a lot to enhance the excellent period feeling of this motion picture.But when I finally read about the release of the CD with the music from this film I noticed that none of those wonderful French songs made it to the final selection. To me it is a big disappointment, and a strong reason not to buy it.Is there any rational explanation for not including the French songs in this CD? If anyone can answer that, please tell me."
1,Disappointment,"The cabaret scenes are just so 1950's Siagon but what did they leave off the soundtrack? That's right, those haunting French cabaret songs, the best part of the movie's soundtrack. And who was the singer? Alas, fabulous but unknown."
2,rumble fish,"rumble fish is a story about rusty-james, steve, and the motorcycle boy. the book was boring at times when the charaters where narrating back and forth. i found the book interesting when rusty-james was fighting or in a conflict.it took place in a big city. it was not really predictable."
3,Rumble Fish,I thought that this book was ok.The only part I liked was when they got into the knife fight.Overall I thought this book was kind of boring.
2,Luke's review for Rumble Fish,I read Rumble Fish and thought it was O.K. It was a book that went on and on with no story line. Overall I didn't like the book very much.
3,Rumble Fish by S.E. Hinton,"Rumble Fish is a novel made more for teenagers because the characters talk about drugs, violence, and partying. The main characters in the book are Rusty-James, Motorcycle Boy, and Steve. The book is about junior high kids who are involved with drinking, gang fights, and drugs. They do not have any guidance in their life because their parents are not involved in their life and they do not care about school. Rusty-James and Motorcycle Boy are brothers and Rusty-James looks up to his brother. Rusty-James tries to act tough like his brother but he gets into a lot of trouble.Steve is Rusty-James best friend who hangs out with him all the time. This novel is not one of the best books S.E. Hinton has wrote. I would not recommend this book to anyone beacuse there is not any intersting parts or cliff hangers that keep you on your toes."
3,Rumble Fish,"S E HINTON was the guy who wrote the book Rumble Fish. Rumble fish is a good book and an exciting one aswell as just good. the book is about a guy called James, he always get into fights with other kids and wastes them. this book is filled with action and violence which is cool. I like the book especially the fighting parts and humour, it is cool. If you want to know more, just read the book and find out yourself."
2,rumble fish,"I thought this book was preaty good.The only part I did not like was that it was repetitive. All Rusty James did was get drunk, get in fights then tell about his life and how it changed."
2,Rumble Fish,This book is about a kid named Rusty James. He is growing up in a bad neighberhood on the wrong side of the river. He is a tough kid and he is always trying to be as tough as his brother. All that happened in the book was fighting. It just kept repeating. I thought the book was going to be good but it got very boring.
2,Awful,This book is about a kid living in a bad neighberhood.He is in a gang.He gets in fights the whole book.It was a repeating story. I didn't enjoy the book as much as I thought I would.
1,Rumble Fish,Rumble fish is somewhat of a mystery that takes place in an urban setting.The reader is left wondering what Rusty James is up to do next.The reader might also feel confused about steve and Rusty Jame's relationship are they friends to the end or not?The motorcycle boy is a mysterious rebel that has a great deal of influence over Rustuy James as well as the characters.just when you think the book is predictable it takes a wild twist.Rusty James finds himself in a perdicament where he cannot control what is going on around him.This book is not for people who are into happy endings.
2,Okay,"I thought that ""Rumble Fish"" was okay. It had some exciting parts, but not a very good storyline. I think that S.E.Hinton is a great author, but this wasn't her best work. I thought this book would be more like ""The Outsiders"", in the elements of many plot twists, and the brotherly love that was clearly shown in outsiders, but Rumble Fish just didn't have it. It's about a fourteen year old kid who looks up to his big brother, but his brother barely notices him. They live with his alcoholic father, and the Motorcycle Boy always leaves. However, they never say why Motorcyles Boy takes off. It wasn't a bad book, I finished it in a day, but that was mainly because I kept thinking, just a little more and it'll get better. Well, some people might like it, but I don't recommend it; it depressed me."
4,Rumble Fish,"While this book was exciting and interesting and kept me reading until the very end, I was confused.He wanted to be like his big brother so badly, yet he still thought that he was ""crazy""? I don't understand that.Yet again I don't understand most things, I still think this was a really cool book. Worth the read, very short. Yup."
4,Good Book,Rumble Fish was a good quick read. S. E. Hinton is a great writer and I love reading her books such as THE OUTSIDERS. The book had plenty of action and kept me interisted from start to finish. I think anyone who likes excting book should read this one!
5,rusty-james isnt so tough after all,rusty-james tries to fight everybody until he promises his girl (Patty) he wont fight anymore..until biff comes to him and wants to fight....rusty-james gets slit with a knife in the fight and doesnt do anything about it.
2,Not the Best,"Though it had its moments, I thought that Rumble Fish was S. E. Hinton's worst book. I didn't like the characters that much. The main problem with this book is that it tries to be as good as the Outsiders, but dosn't even come close. The title is awful!"
1,desperate reading,The worst S.E Hinton book ever. I felt more compassion for Freddy vs. Jason then i did for the characters in this book. Motorcycle boy was a spokesmen for medication. His bipolar gave a new divination of metal illness. And worse was the losers who crowned him king of the streets. The film version was even worse. I thought the photography was down by spike the rugrats dog.
1,The book wasn't that great,I don't think the book was that great because it was really slow and unexciting. The only reason why it was an okay is because that's how life really is out in bad towns like that. And I don't like how they don't tell you where they live. That is my reveiw with Rumble Fish.
2,A disapointment,"Honestly, I hated this book. This book had no perpose at all.The plot went no were,and even if it had, I doubt I would have cared. Rusty-James, Motorcycle boy, and Steve have no depth,you don't see them as any more than this: A dumb gang leader wanna be,a motorcycle stealing drifter/loser,and a scardy cat. The book caught my interest in the beganing chapters,but later on became hopelessly dull. I read this book hoping it would be as engrossing as ""That Was Then, This is Now"",and was endlessly disapointed. If you want to read a truly good book by S.E.Hinton, read ""That Was Then, This is Now""."
2,RUMBLE FISH,"RUSTY JAMES is the toughest guy in the goupof high school kids who hang out andshoot pool at Bennys .and he enjoys keeping up his repataion.what he whant most of all is tobe jiut like hisolder brother .the moter cycle Boy he wents to stayn calm and laugting ,wheen things get dangerous,,,,,,,,tobe the toghest steefigher and the most respected,But rusty james drive to be like his bother eataway athis world untilit all comes apart in on enplosive."
1,Rumble Fish,Rumble Fish was not an exciting book.Infact it was horribe I would not recommend this book to any reader. This book was written for special minds. This book is about Rusty James and his brother moter cycle boy they think that they are all bad and all but they are not. they end up loseing it all in the end.
4,Tim's review,"This book was awesome. Its ending was confusing. I didn't understand. I didn't know if the end took place when he was older or just a few months or years older. I'm thinking he is trying to forget Steve who was his best friend.The book Rumble fish is about a kid named Rusty James. He is a kid who likes fighting. He wants to be as tough as his older brother, the Motorcycle Boy, who has taken him out of bad situations so far. One night The Motorcycle Boy decides to break into the pet store. Rusty James is with him when the cops come. While the Motorcycle boy is trying to bring the Rumble fish to the river, the cops shoot him. Rusty James triesto break the windows of the cop car, the cops bring him to the hospital then a few months in a reformatory.I think anyone would like this book if they like action, adventure, and a little sadness."
4,Jason's Review,"I liked this book a lot because S.E. Hinton is a brilliant writer and she is really my favorite one also not only that but this book is filled with suspense and excitement.This book is about a kid named Rusty-James who grew up on the wrong side of the river and who is the toughest kid on the block. He wants to be everything like his older brother, the Motorcycle Boy, but he doesn't even know if his older brother is even coming home. But when the Motorcycle Boy does come home, he finds out something horrible about his past that might explain why he is afraid to be alone. Also when he goes to a beer blast that might have been set up, what will happen?I would recommend this book to some one who really likes suspense and excitement."
5,Beautiful!,We lost our first CD so had to order a replacement. Cannot get through the Christmas season w/out our Mannheim Steamroller! It helps get us in the mood for Christmas.
5,One of My All-Time Favorites!,"I bought this when it first came out on cassette, and am happy it's now on CD because I played the heck of the cassette ... and the CD, for that matter. I've given this as a present for years to American and European friends, and everyone has been pleased. My favorite tracks are ""veni, veni"" (I've been known to sing along), ""Greensleves"" and ""Carol of the Bells,"" Very melodic, very uplifting, these are melodies I can hear over and over again and not get tired of them. A very good investment indeed!"
3,Mannheim Steamroller,Nice selections. Was looking for more hard driving music more of what I have come to expect from this orchestra. It was fine.
5,Best Christmas album ever,I have many excellent Christmas albums (including all of Mannheim Steamroller) and I must say that this is the very Best Christmas album ever produced. All songs are excellent. O Holy Night is my favorite (the deep bass from the cellos sounds sweet on a good system). Still still still is the best one with choir and they have a lot of fun with carol of the bells. -- Bennett
4,Wonderful musicians; not surpassing their first album,"I find the album (CD) to be appropriate and, for me, nostalgic music. My wife plays it long after the holiday season. Titles selected seem to lack slightly the robustness of the first Christmas album by The Mannheim. Their full impact remains for me in the first one, but the second Christmas album is surely a worthwhile purchase."
4,Man O' Mannheim!,"I love Christmas music done in ways different from the original, and this album is a great addition to the library of anybody of like mind. It is still refreshing, even though recorded in the early '90s. In other words, there is a good reason it is still being produced."
1,I would NOT purchase again!,NOT even close to what I expected! On television they sound wonderful. But what you get is NOT even the old time Christmas Music.I expected..
5,Good Music for Year around listening,"I listen to this music throughout the year :) I'm not embarassed to admit this either. I also must say that while I was pregnant I would put this music on and put the earphones to my belly for my daughter to hear, she loves this cassette to this very day.I have the first one on LP and I didn't think they could do any better but they did. There is so much music here that is such a compliment to the Holiday Season if you decide to purchase this you will not be dissapointed.Happy Listening"
5,Magnificent,"This Christmas Music touches the heart and soul, and has such a refreshing new harmonic interpretation of the traditional Christmas carols, that it brings them to a whole new height in music. Hats off to Chip Davis and the rest of the boys for their creativity with electronic music! I have the piano arrangements of all his albums, and some really translate well to piano, and others not as good. The ""Veni Veni Emmanual"" really sets the mood for the Sundays of Advent. The ""Holly and the Ivy"" is great, too. They are very challenging to play on piano, and there are no easy arrangements, either. They are worth the effort, and people really enjoy listening to the mellow piano arrangements."
1,Saudi Arabia's puppet...,"This man is on the payroll of Saudi Arabia and by Palestinian Business men who hate Jews and the West. He is the Middle East's puppet. Beware of this mans writing. He is nothing but a shill for the Jihadis. You will find no truth here, only the fifth column. Georgetown University should be ashamed to have this man on staff."
3,I love this book!,"Keep up the good work! That's why I buy computer books, so I can read Fiction! Your book was so EZ to read because it was all Fiction. Good book if you like Fiction! Mr. Smiley has done it again, another Novel! I give it 5,000 Stars!"
5,Great Database Book,"This book is an excellent tool for beginners, and intermediate level programmers. The way it reads is as close to being in the classroom as you can get without paying tuition."
5,Excellent For Beginners - Leaves Nothing to Chance,"This book, like his ""Learn to Program"" book, is so very easy to understand! It is for the true beginner, and unlike other so-called ""beginner"" books, this one explains the ""why's"" about everything rather than the author making an assumption you already know it. I know others criticize these types of books as being too simple, but isn't that what a beginning book is supposed to be? Apparently they forget what it was like to have to learn something completely new, and how you weren't even sure of the answers to what now might seem like the most elementary questions. What's wrong with hand-holding if that's what is needed? It's not as if knowing how to program in VB should be some jealously-guarded secret. This book covers the basic stuff and prepares you to understand what the more advanced books are talking about. And no, no one paid me to write this, and I don't know Mr. Smiley. I like his books, though."
3,Different from What the Other Books I have Read,"Unlike any other books, this book is presented in a manner where readers would feel as though the he / she is sitting in a class lecture room and listening to Professor Smiley's lecture.The reader / prospective reader i.e. YOU will be in class with Valerie, Peter, Kate, Rhonda, Kevin, Tom, Melissa, Rachel, Steve, Kathy, Dave, Ward, Blaine, Linda, Mary, Chuck, Lou and Bob. (If your name is not in the roll, perhaps Professor Smiley missed you out! :) )Readers will be presented with the China Shop Project Database Project. Professor Smiley starts off with simple problems and ascends to more not-so-simple problems.While reading the exercises, sufficient Windows diagrams are presented and it is as if you were doing a hands-on on Visual Basic Database.I personally feel that readers should have some knowledge on Visual Basic before attempting this book."
2,Very basic but educational,"While I learned a fair bit from this book the writing style was contained too much non-value-add dialog. The book could have easily been 30% shorter or contained a meaningful discussion of ADO.I paused before continuing and took a drink of water.Regardless, I would recommend it to someone who was seeking an orientation to database programming in Visual Basic and had little or no programming background. If you have a programming background or are seeking sufficent depth of knowledge to write professional code this is probably not the book for you."
4,Learn to Program Visual Basic Databases,"This book should be the 2nd or 3rd book in a series of books from John Smiley. Start with the ""Learn to Program Visual Basic 6"" and then follow it up with either ""Learn to Program Visual Basic Examples"" and finally this book. After you have read this book and the John Smiley's book on objects (Learn to Program Visual Basic Objects), you will have a solid foundation to building more sophisticated applications. These 4 books by John Smiley help me get a solid knowledge base."
4,Peak Performance,"What can I say that everybody else hasn't? I have 4 of the series so far. This is #3 for me. It's awesome. Why? Because implementing database access (SQL and such) within your program gives you so much more to work with. Only drawback was Access2000 and DAO. Whole book is on that and it doesn't workout without some tweaks. Thankfully, John has posted solutions on his website. I also learned so much in the first 3 chapters about DAO that I just decided to do ADO anyway and it isn't much different. He does such a good job on DAO that ADO seems easy to implement. Maybe a second edition would be in order. Great work, awesome teacher and I can't thank him enough for his brilliant works. Truly a book that is useful."
2,Not the book for ADO information,"Maybe this was my fault, but I bought this book after reading the review and topics covered and thought that ADO would be covered. I guess you could say it is mentioned when he states that he won't be using ADO in this book, rather the older technology of DAO. It looks like a good book for beginning VB6 using DAO, but that isn't what I was looking for.Don't buy this book if you want to learn ADO techniques in VB6. I haven't yet found a good ""BEGINNING"" book for ADO in VB6 but I am trying out ""Beginning Visual Basic 6 Database Programming"" from WROX. Hopefully this one will actually use ADO rather than just hint that it exists. Or, maybe I just need to move on to .NET and get over it."
1,Not a good book for a quick learning experience,"I found this book difficult to use and written in a poor manner. It seems that all he did was record a class that he taught, and then transcribed every word to paper.Reading what eighteen students said word for word was a waste of valuable time. He does not even provide an Appendix where he outlines teh various methods, properties, and explanations of each one.If you need to learn Database programming quickly in Visual Basic, stay away from this one.UGH.Thumbs down."
1,Beware...the Movie Didn't Play,Purchased this DVD and had it sent to a friend for his birthday. Talked to him today and he said the previews worked fine but when they were over the screen went blank and the movie didn't play. Beware of this issue.
1,WWII look on a Vietnam war,"I hated this movie. The acting ain't the best, and it is totally propoganda. In this movie, you don't see one M-60 machine gun or M-79 40mm granade launcher. Those were vital tools of the trade! They were given to every squad! I may not have been there, but I read enough books, watched enough movies and documentries, and listend to enough Vietnam Vets to know somewhat on what it was really like. If you are interested in Vietnam, don't get this movie, it will disapoint you. If you like WWII movies, you will like this."
1,Easily the best of Duke at his worst,I've given this three stars because it's a 'sort of' institution and one of a kind. Otherwise I'd have given it a one-star.I first saw this film shortly after it came out. The Vietnam War was just cranking up and John Wayne was at the peak of his long career. I expected to enjoy the movie. We hadn't yet all formed the opinions we came to have later about the war in Vietnam. America was still pure and clean.The movie is poorly plotted. Wayne's acting isn't up to the standards he showed us elsewhere. Too bad.The movie was a terrible bust. I've seen it several times since 1964 and it hasn't changed.
1,The Green Berets,Whoever produced this DVD recorded only 1/3 of the movie. I only get to watch 1/3 of the movie before it goes blank. I do not know what happened to the other 2/3s. Amazon should not be selling this DVD. I threw away $11.99 plus shipping. Do not purchase this DVD.
5,Two sided disc,"I love John Wayne, and I love this movie. When I bought it, the story just stopped, I turned it over and it continued. I have over 500 DVD's and this is the only movie that has to be turned over. I thought maybe I had an early version, technology wise. I bought another, and it was the same. The movie is on a one sided disc in the blu-ray edition, well worth the extra money. The movie is clearer and you don't have to get up in the middle and flip the disc over !!"
1,"Should have, could have been","Should have, could have been, a good John Wayne movie! Just as well I remember it from many years ago, because this disc had NO MOVIE ON IT !!! ONLY THE SPECIAL FEATURES!!!!"
2,Classic John Wayne. A technical glitch,Classic John Wayne war movie. Just a note. Movie is on BOTH side of the disc. So you need to flip it over during the middle to see the end of the move. Not really workable if you are using a multidisc player.
4,"Outstanding piece about life in the trenches in Indochina, or as some call it, Vietnam","Filmed in late '66-early '67 but releasedin early '68, it includes the outstandingsong by Sgt. Barry Sadler. Watch this thenread Bo Gritz book(s)! Bo REALLY was theGreen Beret Commander this movie was play-ed out from - but eight movies based rough-ly on Lt. Col. Gritz starring everyone fromGene Hackman, to Chuck Norris, to DavidCarradine to Sy Stallone played Gritz toone degree or another in movies like P.O.W-The Escape, Uncommon Valour, The MissingIn Action and Rambo films!"
5,Larry Thorne,"As a Finn, I am proud to tell that the movie and the book tells about our and US national hero Larry A Thorne.Go and get it, yes it is an old one but a good one, John Wayne never did a bad one, right?"
1,I wish i could put zero stars,"Even if you love John Wayne, you have to hate this movie.... Nothing about this film is accurate to the vietnam war. This movie should make every vietnam veteran want to jump out the window!!!! If you know anything about this war you should be laughing to tears during this movie...... its pathetic that they even made this into a dvd... NOT WORTH BUYING AT ALL... i think that the only hollywood vietnam movie that isn't a total embarassment would be GO TELL THE SPARTANS... Green Berets is trash"
3,"This movie is a GREAT ""guilty pleasure""!","Oh man, what a flick! A gung-ho Duke, a morose David Janssen who grumbles his lines, a hyper George Takei on leave from ""Star Trek""... Toss in a wandering plotline and Vietnamese jungles that look like Georgia scrub pine... (oops! That *is* Georgia scrub pine!) and you have one helluva fun flick! Good for an evening of laughs, at least until they put ""Megaforce"" back on home vid!"
1,utter garbage,"This is the worst war film I have ever viewed. It is flawed in every respect. The acting is shoddy. The stunt work is pathetic (using dolls instead of stuntmen), the special effects are absolutely pathetic. The helicopter crashing scene rates as the most amatuerish scene I have ever witnessed on screen. John Wayne is a favourite of mine, but I won't let that fact blind me to the rubbish this movie is."
1,Wow........ what a pice of crap !!!!!,"Whether or not you were pro or against the Viet Nam War, this movie is one of the all-time pieces of crap. Horrible acting, lousy script, lame action, one cliche after another....... it is just so bad in every conceivable way.I'd give it a zero if I could. I've seen it on TV, and you couldn't pay me to watch it again. It was just so godawful. I've seen more riveting action in 'The Brady Bunch'.Want a GOOD 'Nam' film ? Get 'Platoon' or 'Deer Hunter'. Stay clear of this........ thing."
1,P-U!,"I like the Duke, but this is a real stinker...the kind of schlock Chuck Norris has made a career of."
1,green berets,"This dvd was a rip off ,it whent half way it stopped and started over the full movie was not there,I AM VERY MaD,they need to be done over and checked so they get what they buy........"
1,the green berets,it was not the uncut.....i was looking for alot was cut out...i did not like this one...ok this is the best i can do with my review
2,Just a bad film,"Sure, you can argue warhawks just give the movie 5 stars for its propoganda message, and that liberals will just give it 1 star as pussy opposed-to-anything-positive-about-Vietnamers, but if you just watch the film, it sucks. North Carolina topography, obviously hosed-in water, rigid filming, poor acting (anybody remotely Asian-looking will do for a Vietnamese), and dialogue that I have heard 1000 times, and pretty lame action.People just need to honest that this film lacks redeeming qualities, its interesting as a period piece, but couldn't we be using this printing material to reproduce a better movie? Maybe Ishtar?"
3,Historically interesting,Definetely from a different era but enjoyable from a historical aspect. THe BATJAC and filming extras included were informative. Audio and visual quality were good. Not overly exciting.
4,Good movie,"I liked it, but the students were not as interested. If you like good old John Wayne movies, then you will like this."
5,Must Have Video for Any Collection,This movie is one of my favorite John Wayne films. He and Jim Hutton (Timothy Hutton's father) are awesome in this war movie.
4,Truthfully,"This is an older movie so it does not have the cinematic drama and special effects of modern Vietnam War movies such as ""Platoon"" and ""We Were Soldiers"". Nonetheless it is a heartfelt film with a solid storyline and decent affect. I am puzzled by critics who claim ""The Green Berets"" attempts to interject WWII heroics into a film about the Vietnam War. Surely that is commentary by people who know only the stereotypes of this tragic war. Many more of us know the truth. Furthermore the film accurately depicts tactics employed by the North Vietnamese. If anything, this film shows what our soldiers tried to accomplish but our government prevented. I highly recommend the ""The Green Berets""."
2,"Unintentionally funny, with one great battle scene","This may be the goofiest war movie ever made, an attempt to do a WWII-style flag waver smack in the middle of the Vietnam War. Simplistic and cliched beyond words, badly directed and acted, the central part of the picture is, nevertheless, worth the price of admission. A long, sustained night attack on a firebase is memorably staged and shot. Seems a little clunky now, but no one had ever seen anything like this when the movie came out. The rest is laughable, especially the mistakes: Wayne parachuting out of plane without hooking up; smashing what is obviously a Mattel toy M-16 against a tree (see the curved ""magazine""?); and, of course, the classic ending where the Sun sets in the East."
4,A Vietnam movie for the whole family,"Something for everybody, not too bloody & the language not very offensive.This is a DVD that you turn over & play both sides, which wasn't very well marked. We thought there was something wrong with it when Side 1 stopped quite unexpectidly. Good movie though, you can't beat John Wayne!"
3,Green Berets' History,"This was an average video, some interesting footage from vietnam era film. Goes lightly into what special forces did during the Vietnam war but lacked anything really in depth. A good video for those with a simple interest in what kind's of work special forces did, good for a basic understanding. I recommend getting a book for anything more in depth like indside the green berets by charles simpson."
1,Non-anamorphic and a flipper...NO!!!!,The box says it's enhanced for widescreen TVs--and it isn't. That should mean 16x9--it doesn't. It's letterboxed. It's just a repackaging (yellow band across top) of the original primitive flipper disk.
2,"A silly movie, but still good for a laugh","Wayne avoided military service during World War Two, and it shows in the movie. For example, Wayne repeatedly uses his rifle to gesture toward someone, a flagrant mistake that a recruit with one week of training would not make. Appropriately, at the movie's end the sun sinks in the east as Wayne and a Vietnamese child gaze out to sea. The movie's grasp of the war in Vietnam is as confused as its grasp of geography."
1,Green Beret CD,DVD sent to me is defective. Stops mid way through movie. No information on how to return or exchange movie. Very Dissappointing!
1,Green Beret DVD Does Not Work,For the third time the DVD did not play. It stopped 1/2 to 3/4 of the way thru. I thought I was getting it from another vendor but apparently not. I didn't bother sending it back the 3rd time.
1,Green Berets,"I don't like that DVD's hold over 3 hour's a side, This movie is 2.20min long and you have to flip it over for side two, And my side two dosen't work, I'll wait till another company copy's it 2 side's is BS"
3,John Wayne's Viet Nam.....,"There was a line in another John Wayne movie that went,"" When the legend disagrees with the truth, print the legend."" That's what Wayne did in THE ALAMO, and in THE GREEN BERETS, he told us the legend. Maybe it didn't agree with the truth, but it was how he wanted his America to be. He told us his legend. Accept it as that."
1,Pure Garbage,"I saw this at a theater at Fort Bliss, Texas, during the summer of 1968 right after returning from a year's combat in Vietnam. The comments from this audience made more sense than the movie. I was appalled that this crap was being fed to the American public, and they were eating it up. Buy anything but this, Apoclypse Now, Platoon, or even a cartoon, buy don't waste your money with this one. It deserves -5 stars."
2,Malfunction,"The 1st copy sent stopped at 1 hr., 15 min. The replacement disc did the same.Although this flick is just short of government propaganda in support of U.S. action in the Republic of Viet Nam, it is destined to be a classic. It does meet or exceed the standards for a ""John Wane movie"", depicting what our government wanted (or wished) to happen.(Yes, the poor rating I gave it is based on not being able to watch it in its entirity.)"
4,A time capsule of the Vietnam era,"I really like this movie, no special effects, just a good old fashion action movie. No matter that this was an unpopular war, It didn't stop John Wayne from his stand as a true patriot. I saw this at the theater in 68 and it brought back some memories. The only problems I have with it is the letterbox format and you have to flip it over half way through. What's the reason for that? But considering the price it's still a bargain."
3,NOT TOO BAD. BAD ENOUGH THOUGH.,"You found it! Yes. This is ""that movie"" that shows the sun setting in the East! There is a Disney-like quality to this film that makes it watchable. The John Wayne - David Janson chemistry is surprisingly agreeable. It's too bad Wayne's pet project will be remembered as propaganda. Nothing more. Nothing less. Just propaganda."
1,Disappointted,"I was unable to watch this movie ,when i recieved it ( All i could get was - unable to play foreign material ) So no i was not happy with this purchase."
4,Dipping into modern thought in an easily digestible way.,"The editors have put together a book of broad scope and readability that succeeds on many levels. As a dictionary it is a valuable reference work to discover what a concept means in a well summarised form. It is also a great check on your current interpretation of a concept to see if it is compatible with the interpretation of the editors, and is also a great 'dipping' book, for as you flip through the pages you will come to a concept or thought that will be new to you, or could use some revision. It is once more great for finding inter-related topics or further fields of research from a main idea."
4,Love the metallic & shape of these mugs.,"Love the mugs,they can go into the microwave also but love the design & metallic!!"
3,Not for Beginners,"I have had quite a bit of ""old School"" recording experience with tape, but home digital recording is all new to me. While this book contains a lot of info, it is not that easy to understand. It is assumed that you know quite a bit about computers and MIDI. If you you need basic, step by step info, look elsewhere."
1,This book is inappropriate for children,"We borrowed this book from our local library since our 3 year old Son liked one of Nancy Carlson's other books. This was the worst children's book I've ever read and was totally inappropriate for children. Words such as dope, dummy, dumb, stupid, jerk, dumb (2), dumb (3) were used. Maybe Ms. Carlson was trying to make a point but these are not words I want my Son learning. Like a previous reviewer, I too will no longer read books by Nancy Carlson."
1,Not For Non-Christian Families,"Ms. Lewis wastes no time pushing her beliefs. She tells young readers the protagonist's hero is David Robinson, the basketball player but he is no ordinary basketball player. David Robinsonis a Christian. All her books work in Sunday school, Church andThank God's. None of which would be offensive if the covers of her books were just up front about it."
5,Movie review,"Great movie, and awsome price. I saved alot of money, and time by going through Amazon.Thanks Amazon"
5,This is a cool movie to kick back and relax to,I watched this with my son the other night.It teaches the value of not being too greedy.It's fun.
5,Best Bogart Pix ever.,This film is one of the best Bogart films ever. I have personally seen it at least ten times and know other people who have seen it even more times. Truly a classic. Walter Houston is a gem and Robert Blake(lately of muderous fame )plays a small role as the kid who sells Bogie his winning lottery ticket.I hope it comes out soon on DVD. Badges...We don't need no stinking badges...We need this film on DVD
5,"great movie, shame about the previous review","mr . Cerasini, if you don't like this movie, why even bother to show up on this review site....your assesment of this classic movie is so full of spite and totally ludicrous on ALL accounts, it's laughable.....I guess you feel a little better and smarter by having given a contradictory opinion to almost all of the cinema going public and critcs, have you ? See, now I've done the same as you, a vile little piece of critical pap...what a waste of my time...."
4,The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of- Part II,"Take one down and out American in Mexico Fred C. Dobbs (played by Humphrey Bogart). Mix in a young drifter in the same boat (played by Tim Holt) and old codger of a gold prospector (played by Walter Huston) and put them on the trail of gold up in the hills and you have a classic story of greed, corruption and betrayal that can only be resolved one way. Right? Directed by John Huston (who plays a bit part as well) we have here an exploration of what the word gold has meant through out the ages in the dreams of humankind. You know that no good can come from this and in the end those riches will do more than one man in. Of course, Bogart is already familiar with what greed can do to the human spirit having played the gumshoe Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon where everyone was ready to cut each others throats for the damn bird. Be aware this Bogart role puts him down in the mud with the rest of us. But as almost always he carries off the role in fine fashion."
4,Excelent old movie,"Hi, I think this movie is excellent, Bogart and Huston were the best actors. This movie was filmed in Tampico, Mexico, my city, and was very exciting to watch how Tampico was before I had been born. Greetings from Tampico, Mexico"
1,The Treasure of The Sierra Madre,"I'm not reviewing the movie which of course is one of the top movies of all time but the production of this particular DVD. I rec'd from Amazon what appeared to be a perfectly normal, professional grade DVD from Warner Brothers only to find out that they put in the second disc of a two-disc set with no disc one. Buyers beware. Someone at Warner's messed up. I doubt Amazon is even aware of the problem. I'm not the only one. Check with Amazon by email or tx first before ordering the version with Bogart on the front sleeve holding a revolver in his right hand on a light brown/tan background. I doubt Amazon will do anything for me as I threw my receipt away months ago but at least you as a prospective buyer can be alerted."
1,No movie,"Against all indications at purchase, no movie disk was included in my order. Instead, I received only a special features disk. Be advised against ordering the single edition disk if you want to see the movie!"
5,Treasure of Sierra Madre,"One of the best movies ever made. If you don't think so you are so stupid there is nothing to compare you to. You don't see the treasure right under your feet.In all seriouness, this is indeed one of the greats. I have loved this flick since I was a kid. Can you help a fellow American to more great flicks?"
1,TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE,AFTER RECEIVING THIS DVD WE WENT TO WATCH AND THERE IS ONLY ONE DVD IN THE BOX AND IT IS NOT THE TREASURE OFSIERRA MADRE.......IT IS A DVD ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF JOHN HUSTON........SO I FOUND IT TO BE VERY MISLEADING.AND FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CANNOT FIND ANY WHERE THAT IT SAYS IT IS NOT THE MOVIE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE.
5,CLASSIC GREAT,"This film boasts fine acting, fine directing, and a very human story line about GREED. The setting is deep in Mexico where three down-on-their luck Americans meet and participate in the search for gold. High in the mountains, they stumble upon some gold nuggets and follow the trail to an old mining site. Here they make camp, digging the gold out every day, and as they work, they get to know each other as well as their paranoia.Directed by John Huston and starring his father Walter Houston in an Oscar winning supporting role, the film propels Humphrey Bogart into stardom.The second disc is about John Huston and the films he made in his lifetime. This is most interesting. Commentary feature many actors and personalities close to the source and is hosted by Robert Mitchum.All in all, this set is definitely worth having."
4,Chilling,"I enjoyed this movie, the excellent storytelling, the thrilling moments, the dark comedy. What shines here are the actors, especially Bogart, who's performance is actually distressing. As a character, his descent is so chilling you pity him as you are repulsed. While the message is an old one (greed can consume), this film gives it a new impact."
5,A very great movie!,"If you could only watch ""one"" of Bogart's movies, this would be the movie you would want to choose. It's a great film with great acting. Everybody in the film gives 100 percent. And there's the great line by the bandit, ""Badges? Badges? I don't have no sticking badges!"""
1,Defective Item,"I haven't watched the movie... because like the others, I can't. The disc ONLY includes the special features. DO NOT order this product. And no, inspecting the disc won't clue you in - the package is only built for one disc and the disc itself simply has the movie title on it. After spending 15 minutes wondering whether I was insane as I tried to find where the movie was, I at least take consolation knowing I'm not the only one."
2,DVD Worse Than VCR,"One of the greatest movies ever made. One of the worst DVD transfers of a major movie by a major studio. Parts of the movie have a crystal sharp picture than one would expect of a DVD. Others scenes are grainy beyond belief. I have all of Ed Wood's movies on DVD and the picture quality is overall superior. What kind of a world do we live in where Ed Wood movies are restored and John Huston movies are treated like a $ 20 mule? I saw a laser disk of this years ago that had reasonably good video. Wish Warner had borried it instead of whatever they used. Of course it's a great movie. The movie deserves 500 stars and the DVD zero. And to quote Bogie ""Fred C. Dobbs don't say nothing he don't mean."""
3,Badges?,"""Badges? Badges?? We don't neeeed no stinkin' BADGES! Ha-ha-hahahahaha!""Good movie, but the payoff is this one classic line that became parodied in so many other movies."
3,Over-rated,"This movie is good, but surely not a classic its made out to be.The transformation of Humphrey Bogart from a decent, hard-workingguy in to a greedy, blood-thirsty man who wouldnt think twice about betraying his close friends is too abrupt.Its like you missed an important section of the film, I watched it again to make sure I didnt.A fair amount of the film is in Spanish with no sub-titles.Good for one watch , might get boring after that."
3,"Good Movie,not a masterpiece","This is a good movie for John Huston,Boggie,and Bogie gave second best performance next to ""Maltese Falcon"". ""Maltese Falcon"" is another collabaration of Boggie and J.Huston which was a very influencial movie,and it had a similar theme(GREED).Even thongh Treasure of Sierra Madre described greed of a human being and Boggie gave one of his best performance it is not a great movie(only good).The reason is director J.Huston whitewashed the politics of the original story. When Maltese Falcon was released the description of human greed was okay without politics,real situation. Several years after Maltese Falcon was released he made Treasure of... with the same theme without politics. Greed is not good,but he had to describe the GREED in details including many elements. He described greed too simply,neutrally."
5,Huston made a masterpiece,"Huston has caught the spirit of B. Traven's book by the same title. Bogart captures Fred C. Dobb's gradual demise as the disease of gold possesses his mind. And Huston doesn't need to use graphic vulgarities to get the point across. So many ""modern"" dramas rely on vulgar language to depict decadence, which always seem to take away from the intensity of the scenes rather than add to them.I put Treasure of the Sierra Madre at the top of my all timefavorite movie list."
2,The DVD was not the movie.,"The DVD I received was not the movie. The package contained only the 2nd disk with special features. I ordered the movie, not the special features."
3,good story about what greed will get you,"movie was ok, however story line wasnt my cup of tea. good acting as always with Bogart, just not enough action to grab your attnetion throughout movie."
5,Own this video,"This is a classic story by a mysterious author of the lengths to which human beings will be driven by greed and the folly of their efforts. Set in Mexico, Walter Huston, plays an Academy Award winning role as the old prospector. He is directed by his son, John, who appears in an interesting cameo early in the film and who also won an Oscar for this film in 1948. Robert Blake, as a child actor, plays an important part in the story. Bogart is beliveable as the greed-crazed fortune hunter."
5,Brilliant,"A western that will leave you fully awake! Great character study. Even for people like me who don't like most of bogart's material, this movie rocks."
5,Great Actor to Actor work.,Though the stage like background scenes can be distracting-(especially in comparison to today's amazing special effects)the performances between all these actor's is outstanding.Walter Huston got a well deserved oscar and soshould have Bogie.This also is probably John Huston's bestwriting for screen work.A dark but wonderful movie.
1,Like Taking a Bus Trip with Someone who Smells,"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is like taking a bus trip with someone who has needed a bath for a long time. It's not merely bad; it's unpleasant in a hostile way. The dialogue is inane, the acting wooden. This is just a lumbering, poorly photographed piece of derivative drivel, full of grunting extras scampering around in animal pelts and more dank, trash-strewn sets than I ever care to see again. Humphrey Bogart overacts, and this is an understatement. He chews up so much scenery he probally got indigestion when filming was done. Anyone who questions this movie's distinction as being one of the worst of the 20th century, has a few screws loose. A crime against celluloid."
4,Requires a great deal of determination...,"Simply put: This series is not for the faint of heart. This is an intense course in Serbo-Croatian, and it is designed for those who want to truly learn the language. If you are interested in a more basic book, or on simply learning to get by in these languages, you would be better off trying one of the books by Hawkesworth or Magner (both sold on Amazon as well).One common complaint I hear about this series, as well as many others, is that they deal with Serbian and Croatian as one language. Having spent some time in both countries, I would say that they are as different from each other as British and American english (see Magnar's book for more on this).No other book and cassette combo will offer as much as you can get from undertaking this course, and it will be considerably cheaper and more convenient then enrolling at a language institution or university. While it has some small inaccuracies, it still comes highly recommended."
5,Gripping - truely a book never to put down.,"The most enjoyable read in years. This is one of the few novels where you can't predict the ending from the first few pages, in fact it keeps you guessing until the end. The story is fast moving whilst we agonise with the characters & share their joys, in every twist & turn of their lives.Not surprisingly it has had wide newspaper reviews & has been nominated for an award."
3,Its Dragon ball Z! So get it!,"This game is so cool!! I mean like it's like you can do the Kamahamaha very easly , unlike last game, Uramite battle 22. What where they thinking?? to unlocxk people you have to play Dragon wrold!!In dragon wrold it's ,meesed up.Bbabidi can't resurect the daed, but he's magic. napa and Radditz didn't come to Earth at the same time!! Gohan super Buu didn't try to absorb Vegito. Saibermen wewre in the Cell stage!! But this is like a board game and somehow everbody wants to fight Goku! but at least you can selecxt the skills you want to buy. but thats it."
2,dragonballz Taiketsu,whats up.do you know about dragonballz taiketsu?**** its awsome 15 fighters super combos its ****ing cool.Whos your best player? Mine is Gotenks.The worst thing in the game is that Tien and Yamcha arent in the game. Also their music is lame. If you dont have this game get it!
5,will blow your mind away!,"I know everybody cant wait for this game to come out in december, but let me tell you the wait will defiently be worth it! I am a dragonball z fan myself and this game will be like the first one but more added on to it and the same stuff improved! There will be more to the story mode, more characters (not to mention fusions) and a whole lot more. I cant wait till this game comes out. I hope this review help you dbz fans out there and I hope you will enjoy the new game."
4,I Hope This Game Is Worth 20 Bucks,"With my recent encounter of DragonBall Z Budokai 1 I felt un- fulfilled. Let me make a long story short. The grahics were ok, but even myself as a hardcore DBZ fan had to return it. The enery blasts were awesome, but the speed sucked. You could let your gard down and the computer would take days to respond. To just put it the speed was a real let down. I hope this sequel will make me happier. I love cell shading cause it makes a game look like a cartoon. So after I get this I will save up to get DragonBall z Budokai 3 for Gamecube when it comes out for it. I heard you can teleport now that's speed. If this game sucks I will definitly lower the score. Also Vegeta is the best Goku can't compare."
4,Coolest game ever,"This game is so cool.I love it.New characters,new moves,new abilities,new capsules,and new breakthroughs.This game is totally awesome. ..."
5,A smashing-good time!!!!,"My brother's friend left this game at my house and, I was instantly addicted.This game revolutionizes the term ""fun"" when it is applied to fighting games. This game has combonation moves that are larger than those from Killer Instict on the SNES. Best of all, DBZ Budokai 2 is fit for people of all ages. There is absolutely no blood, so it is the perfect, high speed, incredibly captivating game for the young'ns. If you're looking for a ridiculously splendid time, get this game!!!!!"
4,NICE GAME LOVE IT,it is really a nice game well i think the dragon mode is nice because you dont get tierd is like a board game i bought it because i am a dragon ball fan is great i think graphics are super you get the fill of the cartoons can be better they shoud made the combos like street fighter or marvel still good recomend it love the fusions real nice game didnt gave the 5 stars becs of the story mode and is still kind of hard for doing the combos
3,before you click NO on the helpful thin hear me out,"personally i am not a fan of bragon ball z, but the characters are interesting and it seemed like the game was worth playing, and it is, but if your not all about the fighting games or just buying the game for the name-sake (like some final fantasy games ""9"" is you want to get specific) this falls a little bit short of something I would want to spend all that money on. check out soul caliber II before buying this one and you be the judge (my point is there are better fighting games out there so don't waste your money before trying the game first)."
2,Gonna be like the 1rst one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I think it gonna be just like number one, and that {stinked}!!! In the first one the game was just to easy to beat and the gameplay got old really fast, also the graphics wasn't that great they wont solid. Like I said its just gonna be like the first one with couple more ppl and lil' bit of everything else. But thats my opinion but am more into rpgs, sports, and action&adv., games am not all into man to man combat."
4,MUST READ FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING THIS GAME!,"I know a person who works for a Atari and so i decided to interview him about the game, This is how the fusion system works. If you watch the videos of www.ign.com you will see you have to push some buttons, You dont have to push all of them to get a fusion, EXAMPLE: Lets say i push Square, Circle, Triangle and Right i might get Gokule (Goku+Hercule=Gokule) or if i push something different i might get Vegetto (Goku+Vegeta=Vegetto). Sadly story mode is removed... But we got Dragon Mode this is how dragon mode works, Lets say i pick Vegeta and i have to fight Raditz (Either for a dragonball or elimination) Before i fight Raditz, on the map below Raditz's face it will show a circle that means i have to beat him once. Now if i fight Kid Buu then i might have to beat him 6 or 7 times. The controls are the same, so know need to flip through the instructions! GOOD LUCK GUYS BECAUSE THIS GAME IS A LOT HARDER NOW!!!!"
1,It Stinks!!!!! (Mostly),"This game is so stupid!!!!! The story mode is just like a board game! You just move around and try to find the dragonballs and you look like some pawn and the graphics are HORRIBLE! You look like your in a cartoon!The only thing good about this game is the WORLD TOURNAMENT. Yoy can have more than one person play in the tournament with you. I suggest you buy only Budokai 1. But, if you want to buy this game just for the fun of the Tournament,than go ahead,I can't stop you.But if you buy it and play Story Mode (Dragon World),you'll regret you ever bought this game."
4,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!,"I would give this game -55555555555555 if I could. This game is a waste of time and I got it for free (from a blockbuster coupon). There are NO animations, all you have is this stupid dragon mode. The dragon mode is where you fight against some people. You don't get to see the Buu Saga on 3D. If you played the first Budokai game 10000000000000000000000 times for 10000000000000000 years and played Budokai 2, you would still choose the 1st one. I'm serious if you have the first one go play that one instead. You get the same features from the first one too, only you have more cel-shading in this one. I really don't know what M******* person came up with the idea of having dragon mode instead of story mode. Nor do I know what dumb person would let a person put the Dragon Mode on a game. Don't waste 1 day of your winter break on this game. Follow my advice and you won't waste money."
4,dragonball gt and z,i played both dragon ball z games and they ruled but i also played gt that game is the best dragonball game ever you get to be lots more people including baby vegeta and baby
2,I Need Info,I'm suppose to get a ps2 for christmas of course my first game is gonna be a Dragonball z game . I don't much about Boudaki 2 though is it fast game play. I also wanna know what's the strontest form you can reach in supersaiyn is there ssj3 if someone can hook me up with that info please write review. I was thinking about getting Budokai 3 though it's suppose to have ssj4. Also if you can tell me how faster they are when they transform to superaiyn
4,Dragon Ball z:Budokai2,this game isn't as fun as the last game they droped the storie mode and added dragonworld its like playing chess or checkers but with fighting the first one is alot better than the this 1
4,great game,"i love budokai 2. the story mode is much better and much more challenging than the original budokai and you do much more than just fight. the graphics are different, but cooler if you think about them. there are lots of new characters, in cluding majin buu. with goku you can go ss3, and gohan you can use as an adult. what's even better about gohan is you can go to his ultimate form. it's cool cause he is so strong, and blue lightning is going around him as you're fighting. vegeta is secret, as well as many others that weren't in the original budokai. this is a great game, and an absolute must buy."
3,ALL INFORMATION FOR DBZ BUDOKIA 2,"When I first got this game I was so excited.I played Dragon World at first it SUCKED!!!!!!!I mean It was a board game and the players were all cardboard exept for Goku.You have to kill people 1-5 times or more.Why do you have to kill them that much times.I mean I could Understand Cell and Majin Buu.(all stages) but Raditz and Nappa give me a break.You have nine tasks to fuffil.The characters are great,but the fusions arn't that great Gotenks and Vegito are all right.The fusions that bother me are Tiencha,(Tien and Yamcha)Gokule,(Goku and Hercule)and the guy that Supreme Kai and Kabito make.The characters are Vegeta,Goku,Trunks,Gohan,Teen Gohan,Gotenks,kid Trunks,Videl,Supreme Kai,Nappa,Raditz,Freiza,Cell,Recoome,Captain Ginuy,Dabura,Majin Buu,Super Buu,Kid Buu,Majin Vegeta,(after you get a skill capsule)and Mecha Frieza.(after you obtain Freiza's Spaceship)"
3,I liked this before,"This game was good kinda the samething like part1 but with more characters and more stages. So what the storymode was a board game it was still fun but the part when you face kid buu was hard he was a challenge but i beat him, i beat this game long time ago, i beat all the DBZ games that came out, but this was a fun game. That untill budokai3 came out that was the best DBZ game in the budokai series, but this was fun to."

3,Budokai 2 is a video game,Budokai 2 is a video game. Buu is a fictional character. Fusion is when two characters combine.
5,Budokia 2 rocks dude,This game totally rocks dude! It is so cool! It is worth the money! Gokoloco does not exist!
4,WOW! A MUST HAVE GAME!!!,ok. this game is the bomb!if u dont have this game i really recomend it. if u dont have it then i think u should get it.i read and heard some people's revewes and they give it like 1 or 2 starz!i mean really come on! its the best!!!!!well thats all i have to say.LATER! :)ps.its one of the best games for dbz fans.
5,dragon dragon pump the dragon dragonball z!,"this is a rap i made up about dragonball z.yo,this is a really tight game , all them other ones are very lame,goku is tight but kakkerot's his name"
2,A Dragonball Z Board Game!,"I played this game for 5 minutes. I thought that I got the wrong game. All that it is a bunch of heads on pogo sticks. Exept for Goku, who runs around like a dork. I'm a dragonball z fan. If you want a good dragonball z game get the 1 or 3. 3 is the best. There is no movie scenes. The platform is exactally like a board game only with pogo sticks with heads attached. They look more cartoonish than they need to. The fightings o.k, but not good enough to be a good dragonball z game. The only reason that I still have the game is because I have a code to get all of the players. Go with budokai 3 if you want a good game."
5,"dragon dragon pump the dragon dragonball z!, April 13, 2004","dragon dragon pump the dragon dragonball z!, April 13, 2004Reviewer: ronald washington from usathis is a rap i made up about dragonball z.yo,this is a really tight game , all them other ones are very lame,goku is tight but kakkerot's his namewhoever said this is a total idiot this game is awsome the story mode is really good if ur looking for a rpg fighting game this is your game"
4,"The ""BOMB""!!!","This game will ROCK!!!!There will be brand new characters ""android 20,trunks,goten,dabura,videl,adultgohan,supremekai and all three forms of buu.But the best part is that U can fuse ANY TWO CHARACTERS. i'm going to fuse Vegeta and trunks to make the might ""vegetunks""(isn't that a nice name or what).sadly they have dropped story mode and added a new mode called Dragon World.which you and a team of 3 characters are put on a journey to collect all seven dragonballz.but i don't want to get started on that just thinking about it makes me mad.but hopefully it will be tight.You will also get to train with piccolo and master roshi who will teach you about the new assets of the game.OkaY the bestest part (DRUMROLL PLZ)you can finally play as SSJ3 goku (HOLLA LUA).P.S. vegeta is the strongest I dont care what anybody says."
5,A really GREAT Game!!!!!!!!!,"This game is really cool. Here Goten, Guku's son, fuses with Trunks and Guku fuses with Vegeta. They make Gotenks and Vegito. At the end of the game Majin Buu is really hard but Vegito is better because he has major life like Majin Buu and has cool moves that do major damage to Buu. The final stage Majin Buu is easy to beat with Goten. When you drop him you can run and attack him various ways even if Buu is on the floor. Trunks and Krillin would do well too. But Great Saiyaman sucks, he has no moves. He can't throw anything and that little guy that gives Goku the earings sucks too. But still this game is really great you should buy it!"
5,SO VERY HAPPY!,I remember this book from when I was a kid...it was a favorite of mine. I now have purchased it as well as some of the other Little Witch books for MY daughter. I can NOT wait for it to arrive!
1,A waste of time.,"This is really bad. Usually when an author has one character explain something to another (and therefore the reader), the second character does something with that information--which usually moves the story a step further. Not so in this book! One problem exists throughout the volume. It is explained and argued over and over; no one listens, no one learns, no one worries, nothing changes (until the very end, of course). This is very annoying to the reader, who gets it the first time. Also annoying is the fact the reader is the only one (besides the Doctor) who feels any suspense. Personally, if someone told me the universe had ceased to exist except for the tiny bit of space I occupied, I'd be a wee bit concerned, you know? And I'm not even going to comment on the pointless violence."
5,Painstakingly researched and well written,"This is an excellent and fascinating account of the 1940 Katyn Forest massacre. It is well-told and astonishingly thorough: easily one of the best writings of the incident. It's clear Zawodny spent a tremendous amount of time researching the subject. I had the privilege of speaking with the author and he revealed to me that when he began writing this book, he had been of the belief that the massacre was carried out by the Germans. However, as his research progressed he became aware that it was, in fact, the Russians who committed the crime."
3,Good Actor Not Okay Movie,Chris is a very good actor but this was not the role from him. To say that he is a poor actor is not fair if you have seen Greystoke of Highlander. If he was a poor actor he would not make as many movies. They sell a lot overseas. This role was just okay not great. He is much better in suspense and action.
3,If only Christopher Lambert wasn't in it.,"Christopher Lambert is the worst actor I have ever seen. He is completly unnatural in movies, and worst yet he can't even muster movie chemistry with his then wife Diane Lane. She always proves to give wonderful performances, but even she couldn't make poor ol' Chris relax. The plot could have been better, the movie is kind of blah,but with only one real actor (Lane) not much can be expected."
3,Barely live at Buddy's Place: anorexic version of Buddy's big band,"Buddy showed countless times that he could be a responsive, sensitive and supportive small-ensemble drummer when Norman Granz practically used him as a Verve house drummer in the '50's, but as this album makes clear he was not cut out to be a small group leader. Even though he's employed a couple of creative, expressive players on this occasion--pianist Kenny Barron and altoist Sonny Fortune--he's thinking in terms of a driving big band, from the uniforms to the electric bass player. This was an interesting experiment, motivated by financial as much as creative considerations, but the results are predictably unsatisfying. The music is strident, narrow, monotextured. It's small wonder that the group along with Buddy's club did not succeed. Count it a blessing that Buddy found his way back to the helm of a swinging big band.I can think of dozens of unreissued LP's that deserve to be digitized ahead of this one."
4,I surprisingly liked his CD,"Personally, I wasn't crazy about R Kelly's last CD but this one definately meets my approval. When I put on this CD, all I do is sit back and snap my fingers to the songs. I really liked this CD and so did a couple of my friends. I would recommend it. My favorite song on this album would be ""Imagine That"". When I first heard this song, that basically sealed the deal for me and this CD became one of my favorites!!"
3,Typical,"This cd is OK, because I've heard it before. It's typical R. Kelly, but otherwise, he's still one of the best and more original R&B artists out there aside from Babyface and Brian McKnight."
5,Kelly IS TRUELY GIFTED,"Chocolate Factory is definitely a masterpiece. R. Kelly continues to give the fans what they love. I'm so glad that he didn't change his style (with songs like Ignition)just because of a few rumors. I have always loved the way R. Kelly comes up with songs that are both sexual and sensual but can also go from ""Bumpin and Grindin"" to ""I Believe I Can Fly"". From a true fan: Kelly keep doing the [same] thing!!..."
5,"R. Kelly ""You Are The Champ""","With this CD....""I DO WED, R.KELLY""This CD has taken R.Kelly to another level. He have traveled through many music eras with this CD.R.Kelly,""I thank you for the striking music collage""PS...What are you going to sing at OUR wedding??"
1,Does anybody remember 12 Play?,"What is the world coming to? R. Kelly used to be a good vocalist with occasionly intelligent lyrics. Now, he's just another 'homie' of the rap game. I put up with his double-disc crossover set R., but i drew the line with TP-2.com, that was enough. His lyrics are now so senseless i'm ashamed to say i was ever a fan. ""this is the remix to Ignition, hot & fresh out the kitchen, mama rollin' that body got every man in hear wishin', sippin' on Coke & rum, i'm like so what i'm drunk, it's the freakin' weekend baby i'm about to have me some fun""? How much of that can you really stand? Please, get over rap. Buy his classic 12 Play, R. Kelly, and Born Into The 90's albums, hell, why not even pick up R., just forget about Chocalate Factory and TP-2.com, you'll thank me eventually."
1,Stagga lee is infinitely better,"I don't see the hype with R. Kelly. He was a cheesy singer (ie the song w/ celine dion) and now he's trying to act ghetto. The songs r overproduced and seem too manufactured. If you want groundbreaking, innovative lyrics on the cutting edge of the hip hop scene, check out stagga lee. Has better rhymes in one verse than r kelly does in an entire album. Stagga lee is def mvp."
3,melting like chocolate,"Man I luuuuuuv r kelly, back in da dayz this guy was da man and 2 b honest he still keeps it real on this album. Its aight it aint bad by any means and there some real hot joints on this album.Songs to look out 4 are as follows:-Ignition remixSnakesnake remix (with camron)step in the name of loveIts a good album but i really think his earlier work can never be beaten those were the slow jams never to be forgotten.Also check out r kellys new track- THOIA THOING it aint on the album but its a banging club track from the man himself."
5,Chocolate Factory: Classic,"Despite what the media says or has against him, R. Kelly contines to make great music. His latest CD is simply breathtaking and will have you wanting more. His production has definitely improved. Recommended"
1,the only way he can go is up coz this album is down,if it wasnt for the song Ignition remix .i would have rated this album a zero. i do like r kelly but this album is just not my cup of tea . seriously if u want an album that is ideal for dozing off buy this album .its the altemate must sleep album.r kelly can only get better coz this is just the worst of his albums ive heard.He spends too much time writing songs for others ie B2K and forgets he still has his own career to maintain.I aint got nothing against this man except his albumall i can say is Ive heard better and i aint impressed at all
1,the tittle,"I just wonder if the Choclate Factory is where r.kelly makes his doo doo butter. This CD sux, the only song on here that would get attention is ""ignition"", but ""I wanna pee on u"" should have been on this album."
1,sorry R,"i dont have much love for CHILD MOLESTERS and RAPISTSur voice aint bad tho, its a real shame"
5,The R is back...,"I have been an R. Kelly fan since he fell onto the scene with Public Announcement. Although he lost me with R. and TP-2, he WOWED me with Chocolate Factory. He brings real R&B music back to the surface and shows what he's really made of. This CD is mostly filled with love songs....despite the tempo, they're all about LOVE (although Snake is about...well...you get the idea). Regardless of his legal woes, Robert Kelly put some ""stank"" on this CD and brings the real deal. This is his BEST work to date in my opinion. For all those men that find themselves at a loss for words to their women, grab this CD and pick a song...he has one for most situations! LOVE IT!!!!"
5,I loved it!,Its too much! It talks about his life and it got something to dance off of and i like that!
5,Kelly at his BEST!,"This time around Kelly shys away from the more explicit songs and takes the listener through an enjoyful mix old fashioned love songs. Some of the stronger songs include Forever, Heart of a Woman, Step in the Name of Love and of course Ignition and its remix. The Chocolate Factory is a feel-good album and definitely a success for the king of R and B! I highly recommend this album!"
5,"One Word That Describes Kelly, Talented","Man, I like this album. This man is very talented. He hits his notes on point on every song. ""A Woman's Heart"" almost makes me want to get married, LOL! Kelly must have been listening to a little bit of Al Green before he wrote the song, ""You Made Me Love You"". My favorite track on the bonus disc is ""Loveland"", which he should have had somebody rappin' over."
5,Eddy's Online Review for Chocolate Factory,"This album is raw. The songs Ignition and Ignition (remix)are good and make me wan to sing. Another hit song from that album is Snake. Sure R. Kelly talks about sexual things in that song, but so what.My favorite thing of that song is how Big Tigger raps. He raps loud, fast, and clear. This is one of R. Kelly's best albums I've ever heard."
5,U need this in ur collection.,"Despite his trials and tribulations R kelly is phenominal and most blessed. History has proven that those of great calibre have experienced great adversity and stumbling blocks yet still have their own inner turmoils and weaknesses to face. I am not a fan of anyone imperticular but a fan of those with evidently heavanly gifts and great charachter. R kelly most definately falls into this catergory. Yes he may be inspired by Marvin Gaye etc but on Chocolate Factory he comes into his own. R kelly is most definately pioneering R&B/Soul in this time and era and I will state controversially that he is this era's ""worlds Greatest in terms of song writting and producing"". May his saga continue. For those with a sense of spiritually listen to tracks like ""Heaven I need a hug"" where even pastors and preachers need to be hearing to bring validility to their messages. And for those who judge him. ""let him without sin cast the first stone. BLESS U R!"
3,What Happened,"It wasnt that good to me, it has nothing on Kellys 1st solo or the 2nd or the 3rd either I guess u be at the top 4 so long u cant help but to go down no diss its just isnt as strong as the first three."
5,his best so far,"it is very soulful and inspirational. I love this cd, you can't go wrong with it....."
4,The Perfect Romantic CD,This CD is typical of R Kelly's work. I love the way he just came back strong. Throughout the years his music has brought sensitivity to woman and men. We will always need his music around.
5,Don't Be A Critic!,"I've heard enough of the critics opinions. I finally decided to give my own. R Kelly is in one word, ""Talented."" I love to listen to his music. He, in my opinion, is the most talented R&B vocal artist ever, and I'm sure that many would agree. I've never listened to an R Kelly song that i've disliked. Many people are against him nowadays because of the things that were said to be done by him but not yet proven. But even if they are proven, who are ""you all"" to judge someone. I thought that was God's job. R Kelly's music has been hot from his beggining. Let us all remember that we all make mistakes and none of us are perfect. If R Kelly has made a mistake, don't put his music down because of it, because his music has nothing to do with it. His music is still hot. Thats my opinion. ~[]D [] []v[] []D~"
5,A Fan 4Life,"I think this man has got to be the most brillant songwriter of today's time. His songs are so moving and speaks of situations that we all, in one way or another, can relate to. I love this cd, and all the rest of the music that he has produced. Yes, he may have somethings going on in his personal life, but who doesn't. And through it all, he still manages to shin musically. Don't sleep on the man's skills, give him his props."
4,Robert Kelly's Still Got It.,"He's still got that style of his own, he's a great lyricist, vocalist, and composer. I think his producing skills and innovative way of expressing the same feelings, and same songs that have been done over time. Keeps him on top and keeps his audience still interested."
5,I loved it!,"I loved this album! I fell in love with it the first day I heard it. I haven't stopped listening to it since. (It should've came out on Valentine's Day.) If you are a real R. Kelly fan, this album is for you. If you are a real romantist, this album is for you. If you love making love, this album is for you. Buy it! Keep it! Put it on in the bedroom!"
5,chock fulla hits,"every single jam on this cd is straight classic and that is straight truth. no lie, at the end of the seventy-something minutes you're just gonna wanna turn it on again. and don't deny yourself!! the repeat button is there for a reason."
1,The Apostate,"This is the worst book I have ever read. I found it very hard to read. I have a signed edition of this book and have met the author. I wish I hadn't walked into Walden Books on this day, I bought it on impulse and wish I hadn't..."
1,How Not To Write Book,"I don't know what the rest of the ""reviewers"" here read but the Apostate I read was abysmal. When a person picks up a novel, begins reading, and says, ""How did this get published?"" it's a bad sign. It was poorly written, poorly executed, and boring. It was even used as an unnamed sample in an essay stating the problem with small publishers and first time novelists. Paul Lonardo has talent, no doubt there, but it's raw and needs refining. This book should've been left in the fabled writer's trunk as a learning experience."
4,A SOLID START,"AS A FAN OF SO MANY AUTHORS IN THIS GENRE I HAPPENED TO GET AN E-MAIL FROM A YOUNG AUTHOR NAMED PAUL LONARDO.HE APOLOGIZED FOR SOLICITING ME BUT THOUGHT I MIGHT LIKE HIS NEW BOOK.I HAD NO PROBLEM WITH HIS APPROACH AND FOUND IT KIND OF NEAT TO LOOK INTO HIS FIRST NOVEL.I THEN PURCHASED IT THROUGH AMAZON.COM AND WOW!. PAUL CAN WRITE! MY FRIENDS.THIS IS A GREAT STORY THROUGHOUT.A GOOD FEEL FOR CHARACTERS AND MOVES QUICK.JUST TO CHECK I ""PUSHED"" IT ON MY WIFE AND FAMILY AND THEY READ IT IN UNDER 3 DAYS!HAD THE CHANCE TO MEET THE AUTHOR IN A BOOK SIGNING AT THE EMERALD SQUARE MALL AND HE IS AS GENUINE AS THIS STORY! THUMBS UP!"
5,I love my 'polka-bot' tea-pot,"I love my 'polka-bot' tea-pot (my five year-old girl calls polka-dots 'polka-bots') It is just the right size--plenty big enough for me to brew four large cups of tea, but not too large when I want just one or two. It is adorable, bright and cheerful and looks perfect with almost any solid color cups or mugs. I also purchased my daughter the ceramic primary colored children's tea set and we love using these for tea parties..."
3,Some Good Stuff But a Little Too Much Drivel,"The book has a lot of good stuff on Winamp, SHOUTcast and the MP3 file format. Some nice details on configuring Winamp plug-ins and the ID3 Tag format. My only complaints were that the writing is a bit awkward and often tends to ""hype"" MP3 and Winamp. Also, about 10 percent of the book consists of mostly useless interviews with people from the MP3 community. All in all, it's a decent book if you are a dedicated Winamp user, like me, or a SHOUTcast DJ. But I definitely wouldn't recommend it to someone completely new to MP3."
2,Great Title but not so great,the audio book I bought was a waste of money. Her accent makes it hard to understand what she is talking about. Would not recommend this to anyone. save you money
2,I bought this for my girlfriend...,"I like Arianna a lot based on her TV appearances, and I thought this book was kind of a self-help book which would be good for my girlfriend. Unfortunately, my girlfriend didn't think it explained HOW to become fearless, so she didn't get much out of the book."
2,Not Completely Without Value,"While this audio book was not without some redeeming value, it is hard to get past the new-agey, overtones throughout. She apparently feels it is an ""us against them"" world with respect to men and women and most of her advice is geared towards overcoming gender bias. In some ways, it felt like I was being lectured about life on my grandmother's sofa and I'm guessing that is because she meant it as a bit of a legacy for her two daughters. Ms. Huffington has a big chip on her shoulder with regard to organized religion, her political rivals, and men in general. I made myself listen to the end hoping there would be some nuggets of value - and there were - but you had to slog through a lot of almost offensive rhetoric. There are lots of other great materials that would be a much better use of your time."
1,on becoming fearless,"Just Not a good read at all. Scattered, uninspiring, and written from an out of Touch perspective. There are too many great books on the subject to spend money on this one."
3,On Becoming a Little Less Fearful...,"I was very much interested in this book because Arianna Huffington has made herself a political pundit and the go-to female for the various TV shows out there. And although I do admire her in this venue, she really did not come across well enough in this book to relate to me. We are all products of our environment and media influences are hard to ignore, but those influences make it even harder to put a voice forward. There's nothing that can't be gleamed from numerous other books and I didn't come away with anything new or anything that directly inspires me. I'm glad Arianna is out there, is a great role-model not only for her daughters but for many other women but I didn't come away thinking I can be fearless; just a bit more aware."
1,Doesn't stay on!,"I purchased the Stant 10509 locking fuel cap for my 2006 Toyota Tacoma in order to thwart gas thieves. However, I found out that the cap will come loose and can be removed with just a little bit of jiggling, even after turning it clockwise several clicks to tighten and lock it. The loose-fitting cap caused my check engine light to come on. I had to reinstall the factory (non-locking)gas cap to get the light to go out. I am still unable to get the cap to stay on the fuel inlet pipe, and I have not tried driving with the Stant cap again. I wish I could get a refund, but I think I waited too long."
1,Zero quality control,"Thought I would take a chance on this item because it had mixed reviews. I came to the conclusion that they send the gas caps out without testing them and let the customer do the testing. Some work and some dont. If you take a chance and it does work, then it may not work for long, because the gas cap is not good quality. Dont bother with this brand--its not worth the time wasted."
5,It works!,"I bought one of these for my Toyota Tundra. From the very first day, the cap didn't operate properly. It wouldn't lock, and wouldn't come off without real effort on my part. I finally sent it back to Amazon and bought another. The second cap is working well, operates flawlessly, and keeps the amateur theives out of my tank! They hit me twice before I got this cap on, so it pays for itself right away! My advice: if you get a bad one, return it and don't put up with the grief. Maybe your next one will work better too! Hope Toyota wakes up and starts putting either locking fuel doors, or caps on their vehicles; especially the trucks!"
1,WILL NOT WORK!!!,"The Stant 10509 WILL NOT work on the 2005+ Toyota Tacoma. I've ordered three of these locking gas caps, with the assurance from Stant that this part number would work. The first cap fell off while driving, the second wouldn't even go on (resulting in a call to Stant), and the third can be taken off without the key - even though Stant said they were redesigned for better fit on this truck. Calling the Toyota parts dept. has multiple responses, depending on who your get - some saying ""yes"" and some saying ""no"" to fitment. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY (as I have)...IT DOESN'T WORK!"
2,fits 08 tacoma,"fit my 2008 tacoma.Dont work very often,its hard to lock.It does open with some wiggling.I bought it to keep out kids.Hopefully they will see the lock and stop without trying to open it up."
5,Locking fuel cap,"I am always amazed at how quickly my orders from Amazon arrive! This product was exactly as described, and I am very pleased. Certainly could not beat the price anywhere!! Thank you Amazon!"
5,a southern women's pride and joy,"Southerns are sterotype in films as sickos. The movie made me proud of my southern roots. Eastwood, as the director, much like Josey Whales, took on the establishment and did what was right and true. The movie brings tears to this strong women eyes. My southern ancestors were human too. Please show this film to anyone wanting a fairer view of the South. I highly recommed it to all yankees, especially those from new england."
4,outlaw josey wales,I enjoy a good western about the civil war and this is a great one to watch with a bowl of popcorn.
3,Eastwood is great...,"I felt that Clint Eastwood did his ""thing"" very well yet again in this movie. And, really, that's what we always expect from his movies of this era, isn't it? We aren't really dying to see great acting from other cast members, a lot of excellent plot angles/twists or a cinematic masterpiece when we sit down to watch these movies, do we?We expect to see Clint being portrayed as the flawed hero of a plot that includes disturbed villains and weak-minded fools. By these measures, this movie fits the exact pattern and level of quality shown so often.One additional thought... Josey Wales might be a bit on the softer side of some of his characters."
5,"A sight for sore eyes...this blu ray has got to be seen, to be believed!","Of all the years and several formats for this movie to be released in...this IS the best it has ever looked and sounded! Over the years (even DVD) the transfers have been soft and lacking detail. Well, this blu-ray brings back what has been missing all these years. This is one stunning transfer! The soundtrack DTS-HD 5.1 really sounds like surround for the first time. In the past, it seemed like three channel...but now all the speakers are employed (and the subwoofer is used).If you are a fan of this classic and love blu-ray, upgrade today! Throw out that old DVD and do your eyes (and ears) a favor and get this version. I am still shocked how well this film from 1976 looks! It finally shines!!I can't believe what I have been missing all these years! Great restoration job."
5,Clint!!!,Great story. Awesome acting. Fabulous scenes. Cool movie. Clint has done a lot of impressive films over his accomplished career - this is my favorite!!!
5,Clint Eastwood's best western!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,You gotta love that part in the movie where Clint spits on the dog for following his band of misfits...And the camera shot of the dog afterwards is growling at him with the tobacco stain between it's eyes.........Too funny:)Finally in Blu-Ray!!!!!!
4,A good kind of ridiculous,"I haven't actually finished the movie yet, class too much of the time, but I seen most of it. The beginning is a little awkward for me, too quick and rushed: plowing the fields with his son, sudden disruption of life as the civil war destroys his home and kills his family, and then all of a sudden he's a hard-nosed killer. However, can't wait to see how it ends!"
2,Outlaw Josey Wales [Blu-ray],"Unfortunately, this copy has two glitches (lockups) which require movie restarts, then forwarding past the problem areas.Not fun to watch......"
4,Great Writing Great Cast Great Message,"One of the greatest western made, which should rank up there with ""The Searchers"" and ""High Noon"" is this Clint Eastwood film. With fantastic cinematography, writing, and marvelous actors, you will not be disappointed with the story as well as the comic relief between Josey and Lon Watie. My favorite part is the sobering dialogue between Chief Ten Bears and Josey Wales near the end where they meet at the Comanche camp. This discussion between potential enemies is marvelous and the actors display their craft so convincingly in making this not just a talk on horse back but conveying messages about life that anyone can understand. This is truely a classic western but even more so a classic drama which highlights a great ensemble cast. This is a film that has revenge, love, hardship, and peace all encompassing a great 2 hours. I highly recommend this to any true class western buffs."
5,An Eastwood classic,"Clint Eastwood's The Outlaw Josey Wales is one of his best,a tale of revenge by a farmer whose family has beenmurdered by a band of Red-legs during the time of the Civil War. The cast is outstanding and the story line flows from the time the helpless farmer Wales sees his family murdered to the final climax when Wales now a hunted Outlaw and killer gets his revenge. eighty year old Chief Dan George is wonderful as an old Indian who has lost his way as the white man has pushed his people onto the reservation. Will Sampson is also excellent as an Indian Chief who becomes Wales blood brother against the Red-legs."
5,Greatest cowboy of all time!,How could you not love one of the greatest westerns of all time staring the greatest cowboy of all time!
