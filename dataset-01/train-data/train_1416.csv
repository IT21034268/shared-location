2,Too much of anything becomes dreary.,"I have laughed at all episodes of I Carly, even at a rerun or two. But Nick/Disney on Fox makes reruns an extreme activity. Can you die of boredom? Miranda, get a new project."
5,I'm A True Believer,"That's correct. This is excellent and diverse material. This could've at least made gold. Instead, it remains virtually ignored by the general public. I'm Playing For You did have a lot of piano. Better Off With The Blues was really blusey...no wonder it didn't do well on the charts. Hoss Allen Seque(how do you prononce it) is basically radio programming. True Believer was his last top 50 hit, barely making top 30(deserved better). Please Jesus(Send My Baby Home To Me) is the best on here. It's gospel, but not as you'd expect. It's more of a prayer type of song. It is a great Christmas gift that I recently got. It also includes the lyrics in case you don't know what they are. Please don't let the fact that it didn't gain much promotion get to you. Buy it if you can; I hope you won't be disappointed by it, and God bless you!"
4,a good little book,"Originally written in 1954, and recently re-released with a new introduction by the now ninety-two year old author, Portrait of Calvin is both old and new. Two parts biography and one part theology Parker offers a very thin slice of the life of John Calvin, centered almost exclusively on his time in Geneva.Portrait of Calvin is informative and interesting and does not require a degree in theology to understand. Parker provides both a historical and theological window into the life of John Calvin, peeling back the veil on this Christ-driven man of God who has shaped our theology perhaps more than any other man in the last millennium. Portrait of Calvin will serve as a good introduction for those who are new to Calvin, or as a happy refresher to the Calvin enthusiast."
4,Pretty Cool,"The music is good (although not my favorite of Buckethead's)...with decent quality audio and video. Maximum Bob is off the charts; this dvd is worth it just to see him perform on stage. Also some funny non-musical footage of Buckethead when he was younger (with a sock hat prior to KFC era).Overall likely not the best video footage of Buckethead, a must have for any true fan."
2,"Just in case you're a glutton for punishment, there's a Part 2","First, this is a camcorder video... And it doesn't appear to be a good quality camera nor a steady hand.It's apparent this stange guy has studied lots of Mel Bay song books and purchased may different instructional videos and studied them feverously but, it's like this guy needs several classes in music theory to put it all together. A versed guitarist will see MANY different styles in his playing.He's a very fast player but doesn't seem to have the ability to put any of it together to make it fit or make sense of what he's playing.Buckethead appears to be the guy at the party who picks up a guitar and starts rippin' some blistering solos, gets a small crowd thay say ""ooo and ahhh"" and then those spectators say ""play _________"" and he's putting the guitar back down.I don't regret buying this video because it was interesting to watch once or twice just to see his skills but I do regret paying over $5.00 for it!"
2,Flawed design,"This APC device does a good filtering job and has plenty of receptacles for TV and accessories. A good feature is the blue light signaling the polarity of the input current. Yet an overwhelming flaw is the fact that every time there is an interruption, blackout or brownout, you have to reset the breaker on the device before the plug-in instruments work. This fact was not clear before I bought the device, and it made it useles for me. I bought 2, replaced them and discarded these."
5,Wow!,"I spent some time in Morocco as a tourist, and made a particular effort to get to know the people and culture. But, the Morocco described in this book is SO much more interesting, personal, and emotional than anybody could see on their own during a simple vacation. Living ""in country"" allows a far more intimate view of the people and their thoughts. The portraits painted in this book are especially interesting in light of today's conflicts between the West and the Arabs. And, the stories are told in such as warm-hearted way, I felt I was there with the author."
3,Not comfortable in my hand.,"While these knives are very sharp and they do cut well, they are very uncomfortable in my hand. I find myself reaching for the more comfortable knives that are less sharp. They would be great if the handles were more ergonomic. I would not recommend this knife set."
2,Not a cut above the rest,"I have had my Global knife set for about 2 years now and haven't used it more than a couple dozen times. The blades went dull really quick, and I can't seem to get them sharp again. Maybe I just got a bad set."
5,A+++++++++++The Twin Grands Are Back!!!,"Here you have two of F & T's finest albums, all together in one package.....finally!!! Hark The Herald Angels, Snow Bound, and Sleigh Bells from the ELF soundtrack make this a keeper!"
5,Childhood Memories Revisited!,This album was a staple in our home at Christmas. I can close my eyes and I'm transferred back to my childhood home and the wonderful memories.
5,"Good video, great sound","The video is pretty good as concert films go. The band is kind of crammed in together and close to the crowd, which is different from your typical shot-for-MTV performance, but that's an accurate depiction of a small-club Truckers show.What makes this DVD worth having is the sound, which is awesome. Put it on a 5.1 surround system (it has options for either 5.1 or regular stereo) and crank it up loud.The only (minor) drawback to this DVD is what it leaves out--concert staples Let There Be Rock and Zip City aren't on here--but the stuff they include is terrific. But since it's unlikely that DBT will ever play Isbell songs like John Henry or Outfit again, it's nice to have those on here. Buy this and then buy the Austin City Limits DVD when it comes out, too."
2,"great sound, but ???",I was so dissappointed with this DVD... the sound is awesome but did the production crew ever hear about lighting? And a new innovation the focus button? It's like they are playing in the dark? And where was graduation Day and other DBT classic's from the opera's?
4,a question for owners of this dvd,"i have the austin city limits show, which is a cd/dvd combo. i would like to buy this as well but am interested if you can take tracks from it and transfer it to an i-pod, which is where i listen to most of my music. i have bought dvds in the past that allow this, but some that don'tthanks"
4,Smoking Set!,"The only reason I did'nt give this 5 stars is because the song ""Zip City"" is not in the set. Besides that, this is absolute must for any DBT fan or fan of real Rock music, DBT has a sound that harks back to the 70's. This set proves they are the best live band in America today."
3,Good but not Great,"The Drive By Truckers are one of my favorite bands, and so I thought I would give the video a try. While it was great to see the band playing their music, the lighting for the video and the sound quality was not up to par. If you like DBT's music, you will probably be able to put up with the quality flaws in this DVD.Overall, I'm glad I bought it."
5,Revision of previous Apple I-Book Laptop review,"Originally the Apple iBook Laptop that I received was not the requested 600-MHz PowerPC G3, 128 MB RAM, 20 GB hard drive. When the seller was made aware of this, they immediately sent me not just the originally requested laptop, but an upgraded 800mhz/256mb RAM/30gb HDD model, as well as a partial refund!Thanks to exceptional service by this seller, I now have an excellent computer."
3,A KIND OFFER,"I just feel the Apple is OK. I have not used it. I got it all wrong that it has a DVD drive, but no it is s CD Drive. The specs did not show clearly that it has no DVD drive. I hope I can learn more about apple using this."
1,Disappointed,I am EXTREMELY disappointed and feel cheated. The computer turned on for all of 10 minutes and I have not been able to turn it on since then! What a waste of my hard earned limited income! I will NEVER buy another used electronic item. I feel like I just gave my money away!
5,500 MHz ibook,"I bought a 500 MHz ibook.While it's true that the 10 GB model does fill up rather quickly - be realistic - a laptop is a toy, unless you're truly using it as a total desktop replacement. I actually do more of my daily work on my ibook now than my regular Pentium 4 station - and that's a good thing. My ibook rocks.. now I just need an ipod. Granted, you will need to up the ram. I'm maxing mine out at 640 MB. I read one reviewer saying it was hard to exchange files between PC's & Macs... but exchanging files between pc & mac platforms isn't hard. Some programs haven't come to mac yet, but I seem to like the programs that mac has better - for example, itunes rules...Anyway, I'm not gonna ramble anymore - just face the facts. Apple builds an excellent laptop (it's really eye-catching, and sturdy), and when you compare the two, there's no reason to get a PC laptop, in my view (though tons of people still do). :)"
1,Review,"I really do not like the product that I got. It is not willing to connect to the internet, i've tried numerous ways. The screen does not want to turn on unless its in a certain position which makes it impossible to type and read at the same time. I am really disappointed in this product."
4,Nice but the color is off,"Another 'just because it's pink' purchase. It's a nice bowl - not too big, not too small but the color is off. I have several other pieces in this collection, the pink color of this bowl is grayish not the pink color of the other pieces I have. The bowl is great just not quite the warm pink I would have preferred. I kept it and will use it."
5,Just GoingTo The Dentist,This book is about a kid who goes to the dentist for a normal check-up and when it's his turn they go through the check-up and he spots a cavity. He gets scared then he does it and it's all over with. I would recommend this to an 8-year-old. Going to the dentist isn't always bad.
1,Worst 'Going to Dentist' book ever written!,"Out of all the ""Going to Dentist"" children's book I ever read, this is got to be the worst one.Phrases like ""We had to wait a long time"", ""Dentist wasn't ready to see me"", ""dentist was going to drill a hole in my tooth"", and illustration of dentist with a needle in his hand, and dentist handing out lollipop definitely do not make children comfortable. The book further conclude with ""going to dentist just made me tired"". If you want your children to be scared of their first dental visit, you should get this book."
1,AWFUL!!!,"I work in a Pediatric Dental practice. I ordered this book for my son and for his class, my niece and nephews. I threw them all away b/c they show the needle, which NEVER happens and is one way to get your child to be afraid of going to the dentist. In the end, Little Critter gets a lollipop for being so good, and granted the jar in the background says ""Sugar Free"", preschool aged kids cannot read. I was very disappointed b/c I love Little Critter, but not a good idea to get your child excited about going to the dentist."
1,not for preschoolers,Got this for my 3 year old's first dentist visit. Horrendous book. A 3 year old doesn't need to know about cavities and shots. too scary!! Plus the illustrations are not nice to look at. I would not recommend this book to anybody.
2,Scary Book,"Just returned from bookstore with plans to purchase book to help with child's upcoming dental visit. He is already nervous about it. Although this may be a nice book in it's own right, it is NOT a book that seems to comfort a child's fears of the dentist. There are needles and overall dark and busy illustrations that seem overwhelming to a youngster. i felt like i was reading Where the Wild Things Are, rather than a book i was hoping would placate my child's concerns. Even the critters little frog friend gets scared in the book. it might be a realistic book, but i'll have to find another way to prepare my child for his dental visit."
2,Gib Rides Home,"Gib Rides Home was a very sad sorry about a boy who's parents died. There was too much violence, with the teachers beating the children and one boy even died. This story has been called ""heart warming"" I dissagee. The story line was interesting and the charactors were wonderful, but the ending left you hanging. You never find out if any of the other suffering children received help. This book would have been good and ""heart warming"" if the author finished the story not left you wondering if Gib ever went back to help the others."
1,whew,"Lord im so glad i rented this book before i bought it. I HATED IT. absolutely awful. what was the plot? was there meaning? NO. If you want to read something, read the nutrition facts on a box of cereal instead of reading this book."
2,Kind of Sad,"Stepfanie was an attractive, sultry actress on Hunter. She fit her role well. But this is a poor fit. The music is generic and her voice is forgetable.Stepfanie, you should have stuck to acting."
5,"This CD ""ROCKS""",With every word of every song I could relate it to a situation from my past or my current relationship with the man of my dreams. 'The River' makes me cry every time I listened to it. It touches on every feeling I have for the man in my life. This is a GREAT CD and I can't for Stepfanie to come out with another one. She has a GREAT singing voice and hit this one right on the target!
5,Culturally beautiful,This CD was very inspiring. It made me feel as if I were in the islands once again. I listen to it again and again. The Tongans are a beautiful people with a beautiful musical history. This CD perfectly portrays their rich heritage.
3,Dance Music of Tonga -Malie! Beautiful!,"I was mislead by the Title: ""Dance Music of Tonga - Malie! Beautiful. I expected the soft happy Polynesian Music. Instead this CD sounds more like a collector's item of ancient sounds (not melodic) from the distant past. It is recited in the ancient form of the Tongan language that is no longer spoken. I can't figur out how anyone could dance to it. I was looking for Tongan Music like for example by Siale Iongi, which conveys the ""Ofa"" (Aloha, Love) Spirit, which sounds so happy and malie! beautiful! And makes me feel so good! So naturally I was disappointed. This CD seems to be some scholarly thesis of no entertainment value, and therefore I can't really rate it."
4,Quite intriguing...,"Hill's The Art of Dora Carrington is quite an enjoyable read for those who would love to know details, both visual and otherwise, of this eccentric and talented woman. I first became interested in Carrington after watching the somewhat recent film of her life starring Emma Thompson. She had a convoluted and emotionally tormented life; fortunately she left behind some quite remarkable works to lend us a glimpse or two of it. Hill includes many examples of her work in color and black and white, along with photographs and letter doodles to supplement the text. Most of the book is well written--however sometimes she references paintings not included or a painting that you are not sure which she is talking about. Her comments sometimes entirely miss her previous point and organization is not its best. Despite these shortcomings, it is definitely worth the read to art historians like me, literary buffs, or people who like a good scandalous life or two, seen through the artist's eyes."
2,Bottle leaked some of the oil,"I haven't tried the oils yet. But when i opened the box, oil stains were there all over inside. I won't buy any kind of liquid type stuff again through this seller."
2,Definitely not for me,"I bought the sampler pack just to try out something new. The oils feel nice on the skin, not overly greasy. However, the ingredients that give it the warming properties leave a strong taste that I just can't get past to enjoy the actual flavor of the oil. I'll stick with non-warming oil or massage cream."
4,"Wonderful, although a little messy","These bottles are a little messy and have to stay upright, but work fantastic and taste great! If Kama Sutra ever makes a variety pack with more practical bottles for travel etc. I will likely buy masses. Also great for trying new flavors and then buying in larger quantities once discovering which ones are favorites."
2,messy little novelty oils,"Concur with previous reviewers about 'leaking' bottles. No stains on outside of box, but once the box was open there were oil stains even though the bottles looked intact.Flavor is not appealing; got 5 bottles, but only 4 flavors (two of 'original'); these are sticky oils but do impart a slight warming sensation.not pleased for cost vs. useful/pleasantness.2 stars only for warming sensation and novelty ""i cant believe you bought this"" reaction."
4,good but short,This knife has met my needs very well. The blade holds a very good edge but on a sad note.The handle is a little short for those of us with larger hands. Since it has a short handle it forces the user to chock up on the blade.This can be a little dangerous when the hand gets wet from fish oils.-JAX
1,Screaming Eagles: The 101st Airborn Division from D-Day to Desert Storm (G.I.Series.),"I was expecting a large book, full of history and pictures. What I got was a very small book with a few pictures and very little historical content. I sent it back. It's the kind of book I'd buy in a book store in the stack of reduced to $5.00 books."
5,"If you need an extra knife , this is the one to get",If you like global knives and already have a Chef's knife and a bread knife and want to get something usefull get this. I have used this knife to fillet fish and bone meat. The flex in the knife is great and the knife stays sharp for a long time
4,Awesome Dance Mixes =),"I bought this CD the week it came out, and I'm definately not disappointed. The first and last third of the CD (tracks 1-9, 17-22) are high energy, and work well for long-distance driving or working out at the gym. There's a strange section in the middle (10:Scar,11:Key,12:End of the World) where the mixers did some strange slow-reggae-like mixing. And ""teddybear"" probably shouldn't have been a dance-remix. Which is why this gets a four, not a five.Strangely enough, Amazon lists this as a single CD with 26 tracks, but it's actually a two-cd set, where the last four tracks on their track listing is on the ""Extended Vox"" disc (full remix versions of those songs)."
4,"Good, but not enough information when ordering","I love the music of Bond and was looking forward to the DVD included in this collection. I was very disappointed to realize the DVD is not coded for our region here in the USA. It isn't playable on my DVD player (or most players here in the USA), so I won't be able to watch it. It would have been nice if the production description told us that; I may would have made a different purchase.I love the audio CD's, though. The music is beautiful!"
5,A Must for Buckeye Fans,"This is a great idea for a book, get some of the greatest players ever that played Football at Ohio State and let them tell stories about what it's like to be a Buckeye football player. There are great stories about how they were recuited, the big games ,their team mates, and most of all coach Woody Hayes and what an impact he left on all their lives. I can't wait for a 2nd addition there are still many big name players and coaches who could contribute. Thanks Jeff Snook for a great book!"
3,"A good, well written book, but too short","This book has a lot of very good information and the writing is really excellent. The explanations are very good, easy to understand and never leave the reader confused. However, the book is way too short. It is listed as having 73 pages which is already a short book, but even that is a stretch since there are many pictures, blank pages and other content free areas. I haven't done a count, but I would guess there are no more than 45 pages of actual written content."
1,"This ""science"" is a bad joke","I decided to to a study of tree rings when I read how they supposedly matched up the tree rings from some 8000 year old tree to some dead older tree to extend the timeline to 12,000 years. Well, I examined the tree rings of six trees, all cut down the same year in the same park and all dead from Dutch Elm Disease. I saw NO correlation between the rings.So, I did the same thing at Lake Tahoe. Still, no correlation.So, no, I didn't WASTE my money on this book."
5,Excellent Pink Documentary,"I was really pleased with this purchase. It's a docu about Pink and has really interesting material all the way through - great interviews, good footage and a lot of her close allies contributing and telling what the early days were really like for her. This is very well made and is recommended to any Pink fans."
5,So right on its scary,"This book is a must for any woman. It gives you tremendous insight into your own personality. What really convinced me is the little details that she gets into, stuff that is just so part of you, you don't even think about it until you read it as a characteristic of your sign. This should also be required reading for the man in your life if he is to understand you as well! This book gives you insight into many aspects of your life as well as alternative scenarios that I found amusing, such as the same sex relationship. If you want to learn a little about yourself, buy this book! You won't be disappointed!**Pandora"
5,Phenomenal!,"So accurate, at times its almost frightening! Sex Signs has become my astrological bible. i love it! Ive had to buy 4 copies because EACH TIME i've lent it to someone, it has disappeared! It seems that Im not the only one who loves it!"
5,Dead on...,This book was dead on for my sign which is Gemini. I read things about me that I sorta knew was true but in denial. A true gem!
5,The title is misleading.,"I have mixed feelings about this book. If you seek more personal and/or intimate knowledge of your man, DO NOT BUY IT. This book will tell you what kind of man you need, but nothing about the man you presently have. If you are interested in knowing more about yourself, BUY IT. It is wonderfully true! I obviously already knew most of what I read about myself, but it did occur to me that this book could be easily considered biblical to most men. IF YOU ARE A MAN, BUY THIS BOOK AND READ IT WELL!"
5,Great,"Beegie Adair is a great jazz pianist. As a listener of Erroll Garner, Bill Evans, Oscar Peterson, Gene Harris etc, I didnt know Beegie Adair. In fact, I discovered Adair because of the reviews of my Amazon friend Mr. Jim (J. Lovins).I liked very much her interpretations of the standards.Instead of writing more, I ask you to download the free Jingle Bells mp3 file and then say me if we are right or wrong.Ah, listen also the the Christmas album by Carmen Cavallaro.(I have bought and reviewed this item too)."
5,Great Combination of Jazz and Classic Christmas Tunes,"I am a big fan of Christmas time, and since I don't listen to the radio all that often, and avoid malls and stores as much as possible around the holiday shopping season, I don't get overloaded with Christmas music. So I do enjoy hearing a good Christmas tune. But even with that infrequent listening, your classic versions of Christmas songs can get old quick.Now being a Jazz fan as well, I thought I would take my first venture into the Christmas-Jazz fusion with this CD. I have to say, I really enjoy it, as did the rest of my family. We found this CD to be the perfect background soundtrack, while we were cooking, hanging out, or having over family for the holiday.If you enjoy a good Christmas song and want to mix it up a bit while still feeling classy and cool, check this CD out. I highly recommend it."
5,Perfect adaptation of classic Christmas songs,"I have heard many Christmas songs upgraded for modern listeners not always with success, but this collection kept the musc recognizable and very pleasant to listen to. My favorite jazz style."
3,"Good Cocktail Party Music, Short Running Time","The upbeat instrumentals on this CD, as well as ""Bossa Nova Christmas"" also by Jack Jezzro, are fine Christmas background music for cocktail parties, offices, easy listening. But note that the running time of each album is only about 46 minutes. Not a lot for the price."
4,Good Introductory Harmonica,"This harmonica has a fairly good sound. It has a plastic comb, which has personally lasted for over ten years. This is a perfect harmonica for beginners. It has been suggested that for a higher quality sound to go for a marine band harmonica which has a wooden comb and is slightly more expensive."
2,Not good...,"This book just wasn't good. I really enjoyed another one of the author's books, Always the Bridesmaid, and I had a hard time finding her other books in the US. So, I was quite pleased when I found this one and I was looking forward to a great read. Talk about a letdown. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. The story really dragged, and the trajectory of the characters was very predictable. It could have been a great story about three women, but instead it was a boring, mundane chick lit novel that can be described as average at best. The struggling mother was not convincing or well written, nor were the two single gals. I would not recommend buying this book - check it out from the library if you feel so compelled."
5,Engaging and Colorful,"This book tells Biblical stories in a way that engages children through sights, sounds, and smells, to imagine what a day in the life of Jesus or John the Baptist or another Biblical person would be like. It's cartoon-ish and colorful illustrations are pleasant and the interactive endings encourage children to think about and respond to what they learn. On a recent visit with close friends, my three-year-old son and their four-year-old daughter asked for this book every night before bed."
5,Really amazing,"This book was very inspiring amazing I read it my husband read it we both loved it, it was amazing"
2,Outdated Equipment,"These rings are alright for a beginning drummer looking for that sweet-spot sound in his/her kit. However, as someone who plays a lot of music a lot of the time, I can't recommend this product. I have knocked these things off of the drums in the middle of a song, got them caught on my sticks several times, and never really enjoyed the muffle they bring. I strongly suggest going with MoonGel damper pads, or the Evans brand mufflers, as these are small and inconspicuous, less likely to fall off or get hit by a flailing stick, and around the same price range, if not cheaper. plus the sound quality, in my experience, is way better from MoonGel."
1,Third semester of crap and counting...,I had the misfortune of using his Electronic Circuit Analysis book my sophomore year. I'm impressed - he's actually managed to write a book that is more worthless! The examples are poor and few and definitions of symbols and constants was almost nonexistent. Get yourself some note cards or you're going to lose hours of your life flipping through this waste of paper.
1,This book drives me nuts,"There are some formulas which only appear in example problems and never in the text. The questions from the back are organized by subpart but frequently use parts of info ""taught"" in future subparts. There are some ""standard values"" listed in various tables which conflict both those posted in Wikipedia and the ones my instructor uses. The ""use this chart to find the value on the curve"" are tiny charts with low resolution and ridiculously unusable. The example problems never have units on them making it difficult to follow along. There are constants which are used in examples (and, worse, needed for book questions) which are never discussed at all.But, hey, you don't have a choice, do you? So just go ahead and buy it."
2,A Little Detail Please,"This is used for an upper division intro to semi's class at the Univ of MN-DuluthThis book is at best a poor text, but more likely it would be better with a reference book that actually went over the material, and used this as an overview.I like what other students say about the answers in the back, ""If you get that answer, you know your wrong.""Either the author doesn't really want the student to know how to do the material inside, wants an instructor to figure it out and teach it, or just doesn't care.A poor purchase at 10% of the price."
4,"organized, easy reference","This book is used at the University of Washington for an upper level senior, lower level graduate course on semiconductor physics. I've found it a good for breakfast reading. It's a well organized and complete reference to many topics. There are lots of equation numbers and the important ones are boxed in blue (for those like that). Don't read cover to cover."
3,it could be so much better,"I used this book the last two times I taught ordinary differential equations at the graduate level. It's a decent book and it covers a lot of topics, but it has an amazing amount of errors, given that it is already in its 3rd edition. Some proof techniques I find archaic (for example, the insistence on Picard iterations, where a single call to Banach's fixed point theorem would be much clearer). A good point are the many exercises, but again, they can contain typos."
4,A Book on Advanced Dynamical Systems,"This book is a useful textbook for advanced courses on differential equations and dynamical systems for senior undergraduate students or first year graduate students.The book presents a systematic study of the qualitative and geometric theory of nonlinear differential equations and dynamical systems.The book has a sketch of the proof of the Hartman-Grobman Theorem which was useful for my second undergraduate course on dynamical systems and nonlinear differential equations.I liked the book and I am quite sure it will become a classic textbook on this very useful branch of Math that has so many old and new applications in Physics, Economics and Finance."
4,not bad,There ok you get what you pay for..I put them in my cerwin vega box the cerwins blew them away...What do you want for 30 bucks anyway?
4,subwoofer,"I used this to replace a factory subwoofer in my expadition, It works good for the price, factory replacment was over 250.00"
5,Quality subwoofers at an unbeatable price,"I dredged up some old speaker cabinets from 1979 that my family had been storing, hoping that they would magically sound amazing. They didn't. However, upon finding these gems I quickly replaced the old subs with the Pyramids to great effect. The sound quality is excellent and they can handle quite a bit of power. The only slight problem I experienced was that the screw-holes didn't quite match up with those in my cabinets, but the metal housing of the subwoofer was just flexible enough to accommodate the difference. These speakers also shipped with fresh wiring should you need it. Note, these do require a bit of soldering to achieve a good connection and eliminate any buzzing or crackling. The old cabinets now sound amazing, and I bought two of these basically for the price of one. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to refurbish their old speakers or simply embolden their stereo system."
2,cheap,I have purchased this sub to replace a blown one. I put it in a 6 ohm cabinet and it sounds good. I haven't broken it in yet but I can already tell that it wont be able to handle the 250 watts it was rated for. it also seems to struggle a lot with the low bass. If you are looking for a high powered sub do not get this product. But its hard to notice when i have 5 other better subs... in the future i will get a different brand when i end up blowing this one. but over all its a ok product if its not your main source of bass.go with the grs 8 instead...cheaper and sounds better...update: replaced with polk db840dvc and there was a huge difference...monumental..
3,"Lifetime worth of information, but is it practical at all?","As explained by other reviewers, the book is a sort of ""revelation"" or coded text dealing with everything under the sun from religion, language, history, science, DNA, futurism, apocalypse, spirituality, and occult theory.While very interesting, and possibly providing a lifetime of ""data"" to ponder over, it is not at all practical or usable in any way (IMO). The writer or ""reveal-er"" needs to give some practical instruction in its usage (an appendix?), and results of those who have done so and are doing so now."
3,"it arrived fast, good watch, but bad watch strap.","it's arrived fast. the quality of the watch itself is as good as expected. however, there are cons. the canvas strap is very bad, really frustrates me. the metal strap connector destroyed the canvas material by abrasion. Thus I suggest if you buy this watch, please order a genuine leather strap for it."
3,"Not bad, but not for the depressed","What do you say about a book where the hero looses his entire family, and it makes no noticable change in his behavior? Because he's so depressive anyway?I find the Nick Seafort books oddly appealing. I loathe Nick Seafort, who's desperate persistance in a black and white view of the world persists. But I want to read more.Fenituch has created a future dystopia under the guise of Military SF. And it's some of the underlying ideas of the series that lend interest.But if you are depressed? Go read Bujold. Because Miles Naismith Vorkosigan is a vastly more engaging, and cheerful character."
5,Exciting SF series/worth the price,"CHALLENGER'S HOPE, second in the Nicholas Seafort military science fiction series that liberally borrows its themes from the Horatio Hornblower sea adventures, is one of the most exciting and satisfying sf series I've ever read. Quite worth the price and highly recommended.Arroyo"
1,"Boring, unbelievable, and unlikable","Sub-par military sci fi with inconsistent characterization and a plodding plot. I don't mind unlikable protagonists, but the author's characterization of Nick Seafort is all over the place. Jumps in motivation and perspective that make no sense at all and render him complete unbelievable. Not much here to redeem this book. Those interested in sci fi military novels might want to check out Bujold's Vorkosigan saga, the Honor Harrington series, or ""Old Man's War"" instead."
5,I love this whetstone!,This is a great buy if you need sharp knives. I am a line cook and use the stone about once a week. It doesn't take long to get a great edge... whichever technique you use. The pink side (very coarse) does most of the work for you. Then run the knife over the blue side a few times and voila...a super sharp knife. I also like that the stone came with a plastic cradle to rest in so it doesn't slide all over the place. This stone is worth its weight in gold...and it's worth it because as long as it doesn't get lost you'll never have to buy another one.
5,Hosemobile can rock. Hosemobile can roll.,"I saw this band open for Shellac in Cookeville, TN, and they knocked my socks off. It took a while for me to find any recordings of theirs anywhere, but then I learned of this, their second (and unfortunately, last) full-length album. The music is mostly instrumental, with sonic references to King Crimson and Rush, with some Tool influence as well. I bought the album on a whim and it has become one of my all-time favorites. This is music with as many textures as a growing mind needs while bringing rock that does not stop. You will NOT regret picking this up."
5,Plodding?? I don't think so!!,"One of the editorial reviews said 'plodding"". NO!! Great read, hard to put down, engaging characters. Loved it."
3,Good Read,"I enjoyed this book, as I do all Ms. Clark's novels.This one wasn't as good as some of her past work. I found the shifting viewpoints distracting, especially in the beginning of the book when I didn't know who half these people were. And even as the book went along, there were so many characters and viewpoints that I often found myself skimming back to see who someone was.But a nice surprise ending and enough suspense to keep you turning the pages until the end."
3,interesting chase film,"This is an interesting 1990 television mystery that amounts, actually, to a chase film through some of Europe's most beautiful areas. The plot involves a young EEC bureaucrat who finds himself surrounded by crooks who are trying to pin crimes on him. Wherever he goes, a sort of guardian angel, with whom he sleeps, keeps arriving on the scene to assist him. We never do find out who she is or who she works for. Lots of chase, little action, and almost no humor (despite this being listed as a comedy). The acting is superb, and the director is above average. In short, this is good fun, but don't expect laughs or any depth of story. This package includes the sequel, The Gravy Train Goes East, shown on British television the following year."
2,Wasted Talent,"Seemingly never-ending, thin storyline with superstar cast that barely holds it together. A waste of the mega talenta of Ian Richardson and the lovely Francesca Annis. Put this one down as a travelogue of eastern Europe and you may see it through."
2,Not as shown,"Besides the size and the fact that it matches a binder I already have, one main reason I ordered this binder from Amazon was that, in the picture above and at the right, it has the black, angled end pieces to enable easier closing. When I received my binder this morning, there were no such black (or any other color) end pieces. I have been a satisfied and regular customer of Amazon's for quite a long while, and this is the first time that I can remember that I didn't get exactly what I THOUGHT I had ordered."
2,"Cheap, but you don't really get the quality of the big name brands like Avery","I bought this binder for long-term storage of some papers, which the product accomplishes fine. However, I wouldn't use it if you plan on accessing the materials in it very often. The rings in the binder are completely round. Therefore, pages near the end of the binder get ""curled"" near the edge attached to the binder. Other products have rings that are flat near the ends, which remedies the aforementioned problem and makes flipping through pages much smoother.Pros-CheapCons-Curls paper near the ends-Doesn't feel sturdy enough for daily use"
4,A new breed of celtic-style music,"This album is a little tougher than one might expect from a celtic band. While you can't divorce the celtic influence it is definitely supported by an American twist.This cd is fun as in the exuberant ""Funky Ceili"" (a great song, great story, in neo-celtic style,) ""40 Shades of Blue"" or ""Rockin' the Bronx"". More often however there is an edgy darkness here whether in detailing Irish history (""James Connolly"" or ""Black 47"") or in the contemporary (""Banks of the Hudson""). Don't expect the Irish Tenors here or even the Chieftains. The beauty of those artists aren't here (although the artistry is). This is more thought-provoking, more raw, more contemporary (lyrically and vocally)."
5,Brilliant Lyrics Matched with Superb Melodies!A Sure Winner!,"I never tire of playing this CD: it is my favorite , from my favorite band: Black 47! Its rare to find lyrics with such depth and feeling written today, and rarer still to find them matched with catchy infectious music, but this CD contains both in abundance. Black 47 takes the best of traditional music, retains its heart and soul, and adds their own stylistic touches to create something that is both fresh and new, but with roots firmly anchored in the heart and soul of Ireland. Their creativity has caused some critics to scorn them for their unique sound, but it is said that you are as distinguised by your enemies as your friends, and never was this more so than in the case of Black 47. Beyond all that I must add that when they sing of the sun rising over Fordham Road, it makes the heart of this expatriate Bronx boy rise in joy!"
3,Super Reader,"Professor Challenger, he of the bombastic and aggressive disposition has gotten himself involved with a spot of digging.In a big way, the whole drilling into the earth scenario. He invites the usual lads down to come and have a look, and they are a little disturbed.This is nothing to what happens the second time when a big even is made of inviting a whole lot of people to have a look at their project. Something down there has more than a bit to say about the whole thing."
5,Soy free crackers that hate being shipped,"I am always on the look out for soy free food and when I found this at my grocery store I literally screamed with excitement. Truthfully these aren't as good as saltine crackers, but hey, they're made with better ingredients and soy free. I ordered these from amazon and I'm very disappointed with how they held up in shipping. I generally end up with about 15 whole crackers and the rest ranges from 3/4 of the cracker to a crumb per box. I can't recommend getting these delivered to your door unless your area doesn't have them stocked at the grocery store."
5,The Battle Rages,If you want the truth about what REALLY happened to Judge Moore read this book! If you think we live in a country where you are allowed free expression of your religious beliefs---think again. Adrienne Raborn
4,Inspiring story of a modern-day patriot,"Roy Moore gives a convincing rationale for the controversy he courted over the acknowledgement of God in this book. Neither completely biography nor legal primer, it contains elements of both and might have been worth five stars if it had chosen to be more completely one or the other. But Moore comes off as completely honorable and convincing."
5,framers support christianity but without enforcement of govt,"judge roy moores excellent and well researched writings delicatelyshow the breadth the height the depth of both our history and ourforefathers thought life.enabling us to see and appreciate theirdiscerning intellects at work to preserve our form of govermentconsisting of a predominately christian people and for the same.itis manifest and undeniable to any learned, truth loving reader thatthe seperation of church and state is not open to modern constructions of unchristian people groups when all relevant writings are considered as helpfully interpretativedocuments."
3,A mixed review,"First, here's the positive points about this book. I greatly admire Roy Moore's courage in standing up for his convictions, even in the face of harsh criticism, and even when it meant defying an order he believed was unlawful. Roy Moore is a very educated person, who knows more about American history than most people do. He also had many admirable accomplishments, even before he became a judge.But some parts of ""So Help Me God"" are very tedious and slow to get through. Also, Roy Moore could use a more humble tone when he writes. He calls Christians who disagreed with his actions regarding the Ten Commandments display ""hypocrites."" It's one thing to denounce the actions of anti-God groups like the ACLU, but Roy Moore should treat fellow Christians who have a differing opinion with more respect.But if you want the inside story of what really happened in Alabama a few years ago, this book is worth reading."
5,Wonderful Book,"I loved this book. The men of the 761st put 2,000 miles on their tanks over 183 days while in combat. After the war these men came home to an America that would not let them vote, get access to good jobs or even acknowledge their accomplishments during the war.As I read the book I hoped that some producer would film this story like the ""Band of Brothers"" HBO series."
4,Vivid Re-creations,"Once I received ths book, it took me three days to read it cover to cover.The recollections are told in a way that brought me into the Black tanker's world. It is a reminder of the events that have not been told or have been pushed to the side."
4,"The State, Religion and Ethnic Politics: Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan (Contemporary Issues in the Middle East)","A comprehensive collection of academic research presented at a symposium in November 1982. Messrs. Banuazzi and Weiner have edited over 12 preseentations. Although somewhat dated, the material covered is a relevant today (2006) as it was over 14 years ago. I do not consider myself an expert in the political and econoic dynamics of the area. I do desire to learn and found this book a good foundation."
4,Great CD,"A lot has been said about the music itself which is great if you can overlook a couple of Lawrence Welk-like tracks such as ""Calcutta"". Not a lot has been said about the stellar remastering job. I was blown away by the high quality of the remastering, it sounds like it was recorded last week. Much better than even the Led Zeppelin box set remasters done only two years before this re-release. Highly recommended especially if you are looking for a ""first"" buy Ventures album."
3,Too Much!,"Remastered versions way too heavy on bass! Original version (we compared) was far easier on the ears and allowed the music to permeate, not the thump. Realize that this was done for broader appeal, but we feel gypped."
4,Very good Ventures CD,"The Ventures and the Beatles were the reason I started playing guitar. This CD brings back those days of garage bands. Their version of Telstar and the Lonely Bull are OK, but the Ventures in Space segment (tracks 13 thru 24) is my favorite. Good sound quality, original versions of the songs - what more could a Ventures fan want? Worth the money."
4,still get me,this cd is fantastic. my favorite of the ventures is on it - Apache. if it were an old record that band would be worn through with needle grooves!
5,Pure music from a simpler time,"If you were to be stranded on an island with only one album to listen to, pray you have this one. Excellent production values added to totally awesome guitar work blend to create a sound innovative and unique. The sound created by Ventures in Space has often been imitated by most of the better known ""supergroups"" of the 60's and 70's, but none, absolutely none have come close to Nokie Edwards' strange use of his Mosrite guitar. When listening to this album, try to remember that they are only using 3 guitars and no fancy electronics, just pure musicianship. Truly an inspiration to all rock and roll lovers everywhere."
5,The Ventures,"The ventures sound great on CD, just like the original records.The cds are hard to find and amazon is great for having this music available. The Ventures bring back many memoriies and now I can listen to the great sounds all over again. Great music, great tracks."
3,The Ol' Grey Mare......,"""She ain't what she used to be"" This music used to feel so vital. The sound was raw and tough. .... Now it seeems tame and lame. Good recording. Fine musicians. It just didn't pull the plough like it used to"
5,A great trip back to my childhood,"I have my parents to thank for turning me into a Ventures fan. My parents had both of the original LPS. I listened along with Mom and Dad to this great band so much we wore out the albums. By that time, the albums were no longer being produce and were hard to find. Now, thanks to today's cd technology, we can enjoy the Ventures once again."
1,What do you use a dorm fidge for...,You use it for BEER! This is a horrible fridge for bottles of beer. You have to remove the one and only shelf to stand them up and then you can only fit a six pack in with two on their sides in the door. The next size up fits more than a case and is only (usually) $50-100 more and well worth it.
3,incredible!,"although my rating for this product was only three stars, i was overwhelmed by the design of this product, it was just so captivating in sight and everything about this ""dream"" refrigerator is just simple remarkable and high tech, so ladies and gentlemen, my final last words for this is... INCREDIBLE."
5,Tight West coast album,"After being delayed for YEARS, No Limit has finally released its 3rd installment of the West Coast Bad Boyz Series, and Volume 3 ""Poppin Collars"" does not disappoint. Some of the songs are taken from previous albums like Snoop Dogg and Master P's ""Poppin' Them Collars"", Krazy and Snoop Dogg's ""What Ya'll Want"", and the Timbaland produced ""Nobody"" by Westside connection. Other stand out tracks include the first single ""Pop Lockin pt. 2"" with Snoop, Daz, P, Silkk, Eastsidaz, and E-40. I also like ""It's On"" by WC, Hateraid by Jake Movez/Walter Goldstein, ""Matrix"" (Possibly best track on album) by Bad Azz and Roscoe, ""Official"" by Blaqout, and ""Final Outcome"" by the Eastsidaz. This CD is chocked full of hot Westcoast songs and has a great variety of artists. Definitely worth picking up--dont sleep on this!"
5,tHE BEST NO LIMIT CD RIGHT NOW EVEN THOUGH IT'S PURE WESTSID,"THIS IA A MUSTHAVE IF YOU MISS THAT LEFTCOAST GANGSTA STYLE. SNOOP, E40, WC, CHICO AND COOLWADDA, SUGA T, EASTSIDAZ THIS JOINT IS BANGIN ALL THE WAY IF MASTER P PUT THIS OUT BACK IN 99 NO LIMIT WOULD STILL BE ON TOP."
4,Expected A Little More From It,"West Coast Bad Boyz's Poppin' Collaz is tight. I love West Coast music, it's my favorite. I expected more from it. Some of the songs are off of other albums such as Jayo Felony's song ""Came Around"" off of his Crip Hop CD. Oh yea make sure you get that one. The songs I like are Bad/AZZ & Roscoe's ""Matrix"", W.C. ""It's On"", ""Poppin' Collaz"", The Snoop & P joint, and a few others. I see that there is no Kurupt, one of my favorite MC's. To me, it wasn't worth the wait, but it's still a good CD to add to ur collection."
2,Poor editing,"The kindle edition is full of truncated sentences, poor formatting. There's no table of contents. Clearly no proof-reading of any kind was done. What a shame. Given the price, a robbery. Too bad; it's an excellent book."
1,August 2012: kindle edition still sucks,"The kindle edition of this book still contains no TOC, no formatting (intros bleed into titles which bleed into stories), many typos, and is generally hostile to the reader unless you just want to read it cover to cover. Forget browsing to specific stories unless you are a very patient person."
5,Wonderful selection of well-written tales,"The most amazing thing about these stories is that they were written around the 50s, but it sure doesn't seem so. Clarke is a scientist, to be sure, but he doesn't overwhelm you with it. I think that's especially admirable since he could have easily fallen back on the science as a crutch and let this guide his stories. Instead, he spends equal time working on characterization, and the stories are better for it. His characters are supplied with quirks and attitudes which we can all relate to, even if you're not the captain of a space freighter or an envoy to a mysterious alien race.This collection was actually released about 15 years ago, as I recall. It was definitely due for a reprint, as it was in my mind an instant classic... a perfect combination of carefully-selected stories, informative intros, and beautiful illustrations by Lebbeus Woods. Cheers to iBooks!"
2,WARNING,"This is NOT a compilation of Houston's many Muse sessions 1977-1991 most of which are unavailable. It is a compilation of his sideman or co-leader sessions for the label. There are 4 vocal tracks. Charles Brown sings Late Night Lullaby and Sweet Slumber while Etta Jones sings Laughing At Life and Don't Misunderstand.---- See also Richard Groove Holmes TIMELESS for more Houston Person as a sideman. He is on all the tracks and is joined by trumpeter Cecil Bridgewater on half of them. These tracks were recorded by Muse records also, in the 1980's"
4,Great tune up - Daily reminders.,"I'm a big fan and a true beliver in all that is Tony Robbins. I've read and reviewed most of his books, listened to most of his CD programs and attended several of his live programs. So I feel like an expert on his work.This little book is a great reminder of all his teachings and serves well as daily affirmations to keep you in step with your goals. Its like having Tony there as a coach to remind you and keep you moving forward.I like to think of it and use it like a tune-up every time I slip up or feel a little unsure of myself. Its never far from my reach. Lets face it we all need a little pep talk once in a while and this book serves that purpose well. I've flat worn mine out..."
5,awesome,"Nothing more to be said, I am a huge fan of tony's and this was great. I can't say enough about his books, cds and programs, do yourself a favor and pick one up now."
4,Repeat,"I recently purchased Awaken the Giant Within on CD. Now I am listening to Giant Steps on CD. It seems to say the same thing. I liked Awaken the Giant Within, though seems the CD is probably shorter than the actual book, but not sure. I was trying to get something from Robbins that would NOT say the same thing. I guess if you like to hear him talk, I recommend this."
5,"Easy style, good ideas!","I always listen to Anthony Robbins tapes in the car. What I like about them is that his style is so easy to listen to. He is both engaging and informative. I think Giant Steps is a great addition to any self development programme you might be on or contempleting at the moment. There a lot of good tapes and books out there by various self-help authors, but what makes Robbins unique is that he not only tells you what to do, he tells you HOW to do it, and how to integrate it into your life. In Giant Steps, the bit I like the most is about self-talk and how it can a change in your self talk can lead to a change in your perceptions which can ultimately have the power to change a part of your interaction with people and your life. He tells you what to do then says do it for 10 days and see what heppens."
4,Nice tool for the big switcharoo,I play guitars and sax in a live situation. This is the second stand I have purchased. It is sturdy and allows me to put the sax at standing height for a quick solo and back to the guitar without a problem. My 4 star rating comes from the fact that the bolt that tightens down stripped after a few years but I went to the hardware store and replaced it for about 50 cents.
1,review stl,"My tenor sax fell off of it and was seriously damaged. I recommend laying your sax down sideways in the case, this stand is a menace I gave it away."
3,Ann landers in her own words: personal letters by Margo howard,Took awhile to finish this on kindle. What a life Ann landers had. I used to read her column daily as a teenager. She gave advice on so many topics. I never really knew much about her personal life. She seemed very devoted to her daughter. It was special for Margo to share her personal letters from her mother.
3,Too tame for my tastes.,"I was a little bored with the subject matter. I was expecting something else. I am putting the book aside and maybe I'll go back to it sometime. Regardless, I like the way her daughter writes."
2,Fred's Lounge--Are you sure?,"I'm sorry, but this CD seems a little amateurish and not up to the level of the live music that I have heard at Fred's on Saturday Mornings. Some of the vocals are even a little off key. I have an extensive collection of Cajun Music (over 400 CDs) and this one sounds like some good old boys just sitting around playing for themselves. It has no umph..no drive or soul. There are a couple of good songs here but unless you are a serious collector, wait for another Live CD from Fred's. Or,if you want to see how it's done, listen to a hot live CD: ""Live from Breau Bridge"" by High Velosity."
5,Cute-for any cat lovers,"This is a case cover for the older style nano. Its cute. Everyone comments on it. Its nice to hold while walking, fits in your hand perfectly. I have had mine for a couple of years and spent around $40 on it. I couldnt believe I saw one on line for $5 today."
4,Food For The Soul,Greg Middleton's love of God and the Scriptures come shining through the body of this work. He takes Biblical passages and breaks them down into manageable and understandable portions that are pertinent to our daily lives even in our modern times. A quick read for a quiet moment.
3,out of date,"Milne's Practical Bengali Grammar is a wonderful resource if you are doing research on Bengali grammar. It is NOT suitable for people who want to learn Bengali. Milne wrote this in 1913 and it was reprinted (with 13 pages of errata still in place) in 1993. His interpretation of grammatical structure is often idiosyncratic and his example sentences far from everyday normal language. He has a lovely section on idiomatic expressions, proverbs etc where you can find all sorts of weird and wonderful things: 'we lose in hake but gain in herring'. In many ways this is a delightful book, but in order to appreciate it you need to know Bengali well and enjoy grammatical speculation. For help with learning Bengali I would recommend something more modern."
3,Cadence for My Hubby,"This album is ok. Bought this for assistance with call cadence during PT. Was thrilled at first, but upon further listening all the cadences sound the same. So back to writing my own....UGH!"
1,Very Unhappy,"This item is NOT what was advertized. It is of VERY poor workmanship, and quality. A TOTAL waste of my money. I will NEVER buy from Amazon again."
4,Not a tin,"This product did not come in a tin. Instead it was a very pretty box, but not nearly as sturdy as a tin. I gave it as a bridal shower gift, and the recipient seemed very happy with it."
4,KamaSutra,"I haven't used the product myself, but instead this was a random selection from the shelf as a gift for a good friend. I believe he liked the product as he mentioned about it few times."
1,DON'T BUY THIS,It doesn't look anything like the picture and the sizes are all wrong. The hat doesn't stay up and the tail fell off after an hour of use. Cheap piece of junk!
3,A Gifted Folk Artist Break Through,"Cassandra Kubinski's second album displays her ability to craft the piano and her voice together fluently. She has a texture to her voice that at times sounds hollow when she sings a sad love song- and at times can sound very strong when she jams out a rock song.She is never entirely one or the other. She is in between rock and folk and piano. Her piano tracks are sweet like Nora Jones, but with a little voice like Taylor Swift. She has an innocence about her that craves attention.Her songs are unique. Sometimes lacking in the lyrics department, but if you can overlook some missteps, you will definitely be in for a treat. Her song, ""Cradle the Moon"" is beautiful. I remember it and can sing it on cue. This, along with ""Twisted"" are my favorites."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MAP,I purchased these maps as mothers day presents and never recieved them. I contacted the company and recieved no response or refund. I would highly recommend buying maps from a different company.
3,Track Listing,1. Someday (New 7'' Jackswing) 4:432. Someday (New 7'' Straight) 4:203. Someday (New 12'' Jackswing) 6:594. Someday (Pianoapercapella) 4:155. Alone In Love - 4:11
3,Maybe Someday,Was very excited to pick up some early Mariah remixes. As in other reviews the track listings are correct. Good for what it is..just be careful where you get it from. Mine arrived with only the back cover in a plastic slip case..cd is still in good condition. Incidently you can get other remixes on the net..longer and funkier...this is purely for die hard Mariah fans.
3,Not Vintage!,"I wish I had checked out this disc at amazon.com first! Instead I made a foolhardy impulse buy at the Tower Records. This is not a reissue of the Mannix score from the sixties. It is a nineties re-recording with some additional material. The cover makes no mention of the recording date, though, to be fair it does not say ""original"" soundtrack. Just another in an ongoing unscrupulous practice in the music biz. How hard is it to say ""recorded in 1999"" on the back cover? Do I regret my purchase? Nah. ""The Shadow"" and ""The Girl Who Came in With the Tide"" are among the best '90s recordings of the genre. Had I been adequately informed about the recording date, however, I would not have purchased it."
3,"not as expected, but not bad either","I'm a big fan of the series, and had always found the music interesting. Vinyljunkie1960 on youtube has a clip of the original LP, got my interest up again, so when I found this I bit. The product is not the original theme as done on tv... It's better. Interpretations don't stay static for 40 yrs in music with a virtuoso composer like Schifrin, so the work is different. Elevator music? no... Something I'd play every day? Also 'no'. Just good work by a real master of the craft."
5,Tears in my eyes.,"Forgive my cliche. I love Kate Rusby and figured I would check out this duet CD. Wow. These songs are simple and pure. You can only get away with such minimal instrumental accompaniment if you have the voices to fill the whole landscape. These ladies have it. Roberts adds a rich and intensely beautiful counterpart to Rusby's magical voice. Together --- I just get tears in my eyes. I put this CD on, lie on the floor, spread my arms out, close my eyes, and let my imagination go. I love all my Rusby CDs, but this is my most favorite of favorites."
3,JVC DR-MX1S,"Great machine if it works, had it two days and then it froze. I could not finalize in video mode. sent it back and got it fixed,first day I had it the same problem occured. So sent it back again. I ended up getting a new one as the repaires did not have a clue and throught it was something I was doing."
2,Great Machine - When it works!,"I bought this machine several months ago. It does everything I would like it to do. It has all the bells and whistles you could ask for in this level of a machine.Unfortunatly, after a couple months of use the system would freeze-up, go into ""Loading"" mode, and then eventually shutdown. I talked to a Customer Service Person and they said this has been happening ALOT! I sent it to a JVC Factory Service Center for repair. It took well over a month to get it back. I used it for two weeks and the same problem came back. I sent it back in for the second time and am waiting to see if it happens again. This is completely unacceptable for something that costs nearly $700, and if this is a major recurring issue why isn't JVC doing something about it? why aren't they recalling these or replacing them with a second generation unit that has the problem resolved?If it wasn't for this problem I would probably give this unit 5 STARS."
3,"Great product, but has issues.","I love this product. It does everything that I need it to do. However, when I went to finalize my the first DVD-R that I had recorded, the machine froze up. The display went blank, HDD and DVD-R parts of the component stopped working. VCR kinda worked but sound was terrible. I had it exchanged and its replacement has been working flawlessly.It has great functionality. I use it to copy VHS tapes I have of old movies I taped off of TCM and sports events I want to save. I copy the tapes to the hard drive, create a play list that consists of the show minus the commercials, then copy the playlist to the DVD-R. I also use the HDD instead of VHS tapes to record shows from now on. The manual is a little harder to understand than it needs to be, but the menus are easy to use and easy to remember."
1,Not very reliable,"This item worked well for two months. I consider it a little slow which does not equate with the manufacturers claims. Mechanism would stall while playing a DVD. The drive died after about thirty sessions. Tray mechanism very loose, I consider shoddy workmanship."
4,Excellent!,"Good information on pottery, how to build primitive kilns, could be more detailed on mining the clay for pottery though"
4,Oistrach does it perfectly.,"The only thing that could be better is the re mastering; more sharpness, clearer. With today's technology EMI should do it."
5,Packed full of Omega 3's,"I love flaxseed oil. It's such a great supplement. It's full of Omega 3's and helps support your cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems. Also contains Omega 6's & 9's. One serving is one capsule. And each capsule contains 450mg of Omega 3, 110mg of Omega 6's, and 110mg of Omega 9's. I take this in conjuction with Fish Oil. Even though this may be overkill, it helps support my joints and my active lifestyle. Very cheap price per serving. Optimum Nutrition is one of the best supplement companies out there. Great product!"
5,Optimum Nutrition Flaxseed Oil,"Great product. I added this to my OMEGA 3/6/9 regimen and it has not let me down. When teamed with Congegated Lineolic Acid (CLA) and Fish Oil supplement, you have a powerful anti-oxidant trio. I've lost weight, more importantly, inches around me mid-section since adding Flaxseed Oil to me daily routine."
5,Nice dha,Nice vegetarian dha. . . i find this brand's DHA to be more effective than solgar's. . . . .
5,An A+ for AAA,"Before traveling to London, we purchased many travel books, but AAA's London guide was the only one we took with us. The book is filled with beautiful color photos, great descriptions, planned itineraries, and a fantastic detailed map. We are planning on traveling to Rome this summer and AAA's Rome guide is the only travel book we will be purchasing before we go."
4,Best pictures of the city!,"Took 3 guides to London for our 2005 trip. This guide has the best pictures of the 3. Most of the information is very good. The walking tours are the best! It even tells you when to stop and eat.hmmmmmThe guide doesn't really cover all aspects if you are new to the culture and city. No real tips on staying out of trouble and the detailed city map is combersome. That aside, the book is well put together with wire spirals, the cover is a hard paper for good construction."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The book was ok, but the CD was so bad that it wasn't worth what I paid, and I checked it out from the library, so I didn't pay anything! The CD installation is time-consuming, the application is overly complicated, and it just stinks. You can only take each practice test once on the CD. Of course, the CD questions are so poorly written I'm not sure why I want to take it again!Save your money and avoid the brain damage, get the Kaplan book."
3,Cute but far from perfect,"Loved the way it looked on the computer screen! I had been looking for a lightweight denim skirt I coud use for home, travel, even work. After having read the reviews, I was hoping that was IT. Well, I have to agree to one of the previous reviews - it needs tailoring on the top if you do possess a visible waistline. It's too loose on the waist, but a bit too tight on hips. I put a belt on it, but it doesn't do much. So, as much as I love the look and feel, the ""wear"" brings my score down to only 3 stars."
2,Broke after 2 weeks,"This worked great for about 2 to 3 weeks. I was using it daily with excellent results. Then, on occasion, it started to not give any results. This problem has gotten worse and worse, and now it almost never gives any results."
4,My son loves John Deere,"I bought this for my son after he watched the All About John Deere for Kids series and wanted a combine harvester. It looks just like the one on the video, which is great. The harvester piece just snaps on and does fall off easily. He lost the piece the first night he had it (luckily my mom found it with a flashlight). The next day, I glued it with Krazy Glue and it works great."
4,Two Year Old Daughter,"My two-year-old daughter has a book about tractors. One page shows the combine harvester, and she has become fascinated with it. So I decided to get her a toy one. Once I removed the cutter piece from the front (it snaps on and off) and the rack piece from the back, it seems durable enough. She takes it to bed with her."
2,Sunday Bloody Sunday re-lived,"Once again it is proved that only U2 can play U2. Could have been done right, but once again the artistic license of the creators destroyed the good idea which this was, but failed to be. It should be burried ""Where The Streets Have No Name"""
1,very disappointing,"I have been a fan of U2 since 1982 and enjoy different versions of their songs and hoped to find that here on this recording. I longed for a moving, string version of say, One, or All I Want Is You but found nothing of the sort. This cd was worse than Muzak, it was disappointing."
1,What The Heck Happened Here?,"This is only proof that songs cannot be redone with the same feeling and meaning as the original. If I was in U2, I would be insulted that a song I wrote could be brought down so much. I liked one song, Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses, but not enough to make me feel that my dollar was well spent. All of them sound like different songs and should not have the same name as the greatness that was created originally."
4,"Faraway, So Close!","The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra does an excellent job of playing U2's songs in different way. Yet some of the songs they did really didn't sound right like ""When Love Comes To Town"" and ""Desire"". Although I really like the Jazzed-Up version of ""Two Hearts Beat As One"" and the Slow and Relaxed version of ""Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses""."
1,Coming Soon To An Elevator Near You...,"I don't know where to begin with this disaster of a CD. I admit that when I saw the CD in the bin, I thought it was an interesting concept... if done well. This was not done well.The RPO took some incredible songs by one of the greatest bands of all time and churned out a bunch of arrangements that High School marching bands will be using in upcoming competitions. I find it an insult as a fan of a still alive-and-kicking rock band to have their music turned into Lawrence Welk fodder.Yet, it's still better than the ""We Will Follow"" tribute album if only for the cleavage-showing cellist on the Jewel Case artwork."
1,Shallow and Disappointing,"It's just like a high school band has gotten a thin arrangement of their favorite U2 songs for the pep rally. Furthermore, it sounds as if it was recorded in their band room. I was expecting more. It is very shallow and disappointing."
1,Not classical and worse than muzak,"For a good reference on how a song should be covered in a classical style, listen to Mancini's version of ""With or Without You."" Wonderful buildup, delicate arrangement, good use of a rhythm section to keep the song on tempo. This CD is nothing of the sort. A shame. It's flat in sound, classical songs shouldn't be ""normalized"" at a constant volume!It's hard to figure out what the intent of this CD was. Electric guitar with distortion? Instead of attempting to reinterpret the songs with the feeling of an orchestra and the wonderful sound of a full orchestra, it sounds more like a high school rock group renting a 10 piece orchestra.Maybe of more concern than the lameness of this CD is the fact that some U2 fans seem to like it. Apparently anything of U2 must be good? Shows that if Bono made an album of himself using a urinal, a U2 fan would somehow find something artistic about it."
2,I felt upset how The RPO plays U2,This is a very-very terible for The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra plays U2's music. The sounds does not match at all and not even a bit especially when I listening 'Desire'. I'm very big fan of U2 and I'm very mad of it. Thanks.
3,Durable,"The rug is durable, but I was hoping for a purple looking rug. It is more pink and muted yellow with just a hint of lavendar."
4,Like this stuff!,What I love about this cream is that it is not greasy. It absorbs easily into the skin and does help to make my skin more supple. Just wish they had the tubes of hand cream in stock.
5,Excellent!,"Each song on this cd is energizing. One of my favorites. My daughter and I sing and dance together to this cd more than any other. This is the type of ""happy, fun"" music that gets people motivated to move."
4,My kids love it!,"These are probably the songs my grandparents didn't want my parents listening to when they were kids. Oh, well. Change happens. These tunes are super fun for my grammar-school-aged children. They get such a kick out of the ""Purple People Eater"" that they have to play it for any new friend who comes over. They have had hours and hours or fun singing and dancing to these old classics from the early days of Rock 'N Roll. And parents will enjoy it, too."
3,I loved it,"I loved this C.D. it has all the songs that my Mom and I listened too, my kids didn't like it so much, they only like 1-2 songs on the whole disk, I guess I am starting to get out dated with the new generation, my children are only 4 and almost 6 and I thought they would love all the catchy music, but not so."
3,I HATE THE STUPID NAME GAME,"I think the Name Game is the most stupid thing ever recorded. How did it ever reach the public? It is just a string of gibberish with too many bananas and stupid name butchering for me. I hate it and I wish I had never heard it. It is really vile. The other songs on here are all ok, just not the stupid name game. I think the Name Game should be flushed away forever!"
4,Toddlers Love Rock 'n' Roll,I purchased this CD for my 18 month old twins who absolutely just love it! It's great music for family gatherings because the old and young alike can enjoy singing and dancing along to it.
5,Fun with the kids,"Our two year old loves dancing and singing along to these 50's classic rock n' roll songs. These songs are the pure essence of the fun music can be. Yes, they are nonsensical. But that is the fun of it for the child. They are performed by the original artists. No cheesy dubbed kids vocals like other cd's we've purchased. This has been a treasured find for our family."
5,Children's Celebraton of Rock and Roll,"I am a Preschool teacher and the grandparent of a almost 3 year old. I sent for the tape for my granddaughter and loved it so much I have bought one for school. We use it at school for exercising, dancing and using with instruments. Great music to move to. Have recommended it to many parents."
3,A bit technical,I was hoping for a bit more of a plant by plant explanation. What I got was an overview on the history of naming conventions starting with Linnaeus. The more helpful portion is in the back of the book where they provide a list of scientific names and their meanings eg. maculatum means spotted
5,Great Family Film,"As a parent, I love it when I can find a movie that I feel comfortable viewing with the whole family. I find it extremely refreshing to see a movie portray strong family values and such a heart-felt message. To see the legendary Mickey Rooney AND the beautiful scenery of rural North Carolina in this film were an added bonus! I definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a Great Family Film!"
4,Serviceable Tchaikovsky Ballet Interpretation by Andre Previn,"This is a good rendering of three of Tchaikovsky's most well known ballets--Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, and the Nutcracker. Andre Previn conducts the London Symphony Orchestra.The sound is crisp, the orchestra plays handsomely, Previn leads the orchestra well. The Nutcracker, for example, is a nice interpretation and, at Christmas time, adds an enjoyable element to the household as one plays the music.I would not say that this is an inspired CD, treading new territory in interpreting Tchaikovsky. But it is a well done work and will be pleasing to most listeners."
5,Best collection of Tchaikovsky,You'll hear many selections of music you have heard and the ones you haven't heard you'll come to love. I enjoy every track on this CD.
2,dull previn,"i like the playing at times from the london synphony but previns interpertation ruins it.these are great masterpeices that deserve better,iv never liked the way previn does his music to begin with to dull,not a good conductor,and when the london synphony got him in the late 60s he was pretty inexperienced as a conductor of classical music and it shows here"
1,WAYYYY too strong,"I don't know about those who rated this 5 stars, but no one I know likes this so called perfume. It is way to strong to point of nausea, too sweet and overall it just smells cheap, like something you'd get a dollar store. Please, save your money, plus a little more and do yourself a favor and get something a little more expensive but well worth the price from a proper department store. If you can't, do the world a favor and just bathe properly and don't wear any perfume at all."
1,. Bad service,"Still waiting for delivery. It appears Company does not have merchandise, buys from Natures Life as orders are received...In the meantime promises, promises and no delivery-"
3,"Great Music, but...","Although the cover of this disc was slightly cracked on arrival, it did not affect the disc itself. Anyone who loves Schubert lieder would want to hear this. Unfortunately, there was no accompanying printout of the words and translations which usually come with discs of lieder. Even being familiar with some of the songs, this lack is obvious because not all of the words are known by heart, and not all of the songs are familiar. If I had known in advance that this was missing, I would have chosen a disc other than EMI."
3,Words,I certainly can't fault Fischer Diskau and Moore. I certainly do fault a Leider recording that is supplied without the words!Lieder are song settings of poems. Without knowning the poems it is imposssible to fully appreciate the music.A sad disappointment.
5,Lou Martino - Analyst,"This book is a great resource. The points discussed are practical, immediately applicable, and will increase the effectiveness of any manager when applied. I intend to keep this book on my desk as both a reference tool and a reminder of what it takes to be an effective leader."
5,Another Great Book from Pacelli,"This book really gets its point across! It provides all of the basics of clear and direct business communication, succinctly and effectively. If you are new to the business world, put this book in your library *now*! I can't think of a better college/business school graduation gift under $50!"
5,FILLED WITH SOUND ADVICE!,"Presents 59 ""truths"" about:your recipients;setting direction;running meetings;developing effective presentations;writing status reports;brainstorming;problem solving;interviewing;giving feedback;being a good listener;informal communications;influencing those who don't work for you;and communicating globally.Pacelli makes his points with clarity and brevity. Filled with sound advice. Highly recommended."
1,Silly first person,"This book came recommended highly. I liked the overall plot and premise, but the narrator was an annoying character and the first person style silly."
4,A good summer read...,"A lighthearted romp while still being somewhat literary. It is a good summer time read in that it can be read quickly, the characters are realistic, and there is enough intellectual dialogue to keep the reader interested."
2,Not much to read,"This is a fast read, chiefly because you can skip half the text. In fact, I had to skim, otherwise I'd have gotten too frustrated with Abby, the main character, whose personality is nonexistent and inertia more than annoying.Other parts you can skip: the narrator's endless cataloging of antiques. The silly encounter with a reporter, the whole of which was a hoot, being so badly overwritten. The soppy pity parties in Abby's apartment. The conversation with the make-up artist on Antiques Roadshow. The deposition scene. Anything Lavinia is made to say. The caricatures who pass as men in the novel.I came away despising Abby, rolling my eyes at most of the characters (except Gus, Mary Agnes and Clyde -- Clyde's ""apologies"" are the best reading!), and feeling anxious for the chamber pot. It's pretty bad when you're more concerned for the fate of an inanimate object than the main character. But then again, I think the chamber pot is the main character."
3,Nothing special. Upscale chick lit.,"Moderately amusing, lite, adequate, but not as ""smart"" as many reviewers suggest. Not sophisticated despite its title and frequent references to all things humanities. It was fine, no huge criticisms, but it's just not a four- or five-star book.If you like Eleanor Lipman, you'll really like this. Unfortunately the big reveal about the chamber pot -- the high point of the book -- occurs right at the beginning, and the story is less interesting afterward. I think the tale would have been more interesting if the events had been presented in chronological order rather than in a jumbled fashion.Not my most inspired review but I just wanted to let potential readers know that 4.5 stars is not the consensus."
4,"Dated as 60's, but awesome reference","This is a very good reference on interior designs. Despite of the lack of metric system usage and outdated examples (hat closet, vinyl albuns, CRT televisions, etc), the book is an excellent overview about a spatial layout and where things would be best located."
3,Underground Oldies Christmas Album,"I had a chance to listen to this album on Xmas day of 2001.A friend had just purchased this new release and it is truly a great album which some 'Oldies' Stars of the 1960's and '70's apparently recorded for this label (I think it is !.T.P. Records)I thought the artists (some of whom were Gene Chandler 'The Duke of Earl, Barbara Lewis, Barbara Lynn, The Escorts and more who don't come to mind at this moment) were very innovative in singing some of the best of the Christmas standards.All, who were listening to this album at the Xmas gathering loved what this label did. I, personally would give it 5 stars."
1,IS THIS SOME KINDA JOKE?,"This cd is not music, steps are not music artists in the slightest! they are just a manufactured group of dancers who are laughing all the way to the bank. This cd is so unbelivably bad that i can't believe that anyone over the age of 8 would like it! It is really depressing to have groups like steps in our charts - they are whats wrong with the music industry today!"
4,Its spectacular!,I love this cd i dont see how anyone says steps cant sing those people obiously dont realise how unbelievably hard it is to get your voice as high as Claires in 'loves got a hold of my heart' and 'after the love has gone' which are one of the many good songs on this album amongst 'say youll be mine' and 'deeper shade of blue'. Some other songs show a new side to steps like 'when i said goodbye' which is a slow song. I love every song on this cd and say anyone else who likes pop will too. There a truly talented boy girl-group
3,A published dissertation - and just what that says,"This is the published form of the author's dissertation (which presumably means he is now Dr. Hasan). And naturally it reads like a dissertation. As such it is of interest only to people in a few fields. A person writing a SQL implementation for a multiprocessor would benefit. More generally a person writing implementations for multi-processors could learn something. The measurements of how to estimate and minimize cost of interprocess communications could be singnificant.However, it is of little use to a person concerned with optimizing SQL queries for general implementations (much of Hasan's work was at very low level, such as bypassing SQL's built in optimizing and at the implementation level below that normally available to SQL users).So if you need the specific area of interest then it's excellent but otherwise it's too limited in scope."
2,It's a shame...,"that the zulu chants aren't on this compilation, as that was the only interesting and memorable music in the film. In the final scene, where the zulus make their final attack against the british, the warriors sing a beautiful and haunting chant with oscillating harmonies which quickly become annoyingly interrupted when the british start singing one of their stiff and totally uninspiring anthems."
4,So it isn't politically correct...Jeez!,"No Zulu war chants? This is a CD of music John Barry composed for the film Zulu. I imagine that the composer of the war chantswas someone very much entirely different. The chants are magnificent, don't get me wrong (didn't Ridley Scott transpose them to Gladiator, god knows how), but they don't belong here.Another case of taking political correctness to an absurd extreme. ""Color Sergeant Bourne, what's that shooting?!"" ""A rifle, Hughes."" Zulu is only a great movie, made better by crap like Gladiator and Troy, and Barry's score is one of his three or four best."
1,I don't like Ethan,"Ethan is a fake person He talks about people all the time and then he gets in their face I feel sorry for his family, you shouldn't do things like that Ethan you can hurt people's feelings and it is some crazy people out here"
4,tight Jam,hard to believe it's been 13 years since this Jam came out.the video was classic&this Song still sounds good to me.the Groove was tight&the lyrics were reflecting where He was at the time.
4,Am I surprised!,"The only other review for this item (that seems to go w. the Independance single CD) is A B S O L U T E L Y right! Great music! I bought it this pm in a used record store, and curiosity doesn't kill the cat: I love it! I knew LuLu from the To Sir With Love song, and I felt like trying this single CD (wint a nice and clan pic, it attracted me). Wow! I'll go further now, let me tell you! Thanx for still holding on LULU!"
2,difficult to connect,this connector is difficult to connect and also sometimes leaks during connection. I would prefer a better engineered and designed product.
5,Amazingly beautiful,"This version has the highlights of The Messiah. All the ones you know. Enough that you will have the whole gospel story presented.In beautiful baroque style with artfully added embellishments but defintly not overdone.The soloist all pour every ounce of musical perfection to this recording.I second what the previous reviewer said. Ms Battle brings heart and beauty as I have never heard to ""I Know That my Redeemer liveth""My onlynegative would be that the trumpets are sometimes too brilliant. But for heavens sake they are shouting the Glory of God can't really complain about that.ENJOY"
5,All the walls of misconceptions must crumble to the ground.,"It's me again. I just wanted to rectify the names of the scholars from whose translations of The Holy Quran, this book by Camille Adams Helminski is based. The names of those scholars are Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Muhammad Asad."
4,The talented De Anre',"He died some time ago and in this album you can really appreciate his sophisticated way of doing songs. The best is Fiume Sand creek, beautiful ""Country"" ballade. Then there are other, such as ""Bocca di Rosa"" that really made him famous and that are milestones in Italy's music history. This album really includes all his biggest and most famous successess. All the songs are written, sang and played by him. All fantastic songs. Rhytmated and with fantastic words. This is ""high music"". Is not pop, is not classic music...this is the music of De Andre'."
5,Excellent product.,"Product arrived on time, good shape and the material is tops. Happy with it and much more on the original arrangement is a bonus."
2,Not essential,"As expected, the usual fireworks from the Labèque sisters. Not very subtle, though. The dynamic range is rather limited. Also, the 1987 recording sounds disappointingly metallic. It is still possible to enjoy this album, but it could have been much better."
5,dimestore criticism,"""I'm generally not a fan of live recordings..."" Obviously not a musician. ""Trading precision for immediacy?"" What is that supposed to mean? Was 'Four and More' too ""imprecise""? I mean, what piffle. Jazz does not ""operate"" either."
5,A Classic...,This exceptional recording is long overdue. Wayne Shorter is one of our most gifted composers and an excellent saxophonist. This live recording captures him and his quartet at a pinnacle in his career. I have often thought that Wayne would fade off into the sunset after his duet recording with Herbie Hancock. But this recording shows that his creative juices are rising and new territory is being sought after and conquered. This Quartet is very tight and approach the creative interactiveness of Dave Hollands Quintet. This music absolutely smokes. This will get a lot of votes for record of the year. I am looking forward to the follow-up CD. Welcome back Wayne. Your vibe is strong. Peace.
4,The Dancing Healers,"This is a great read for anyone in the helping professions. I am a Social Worker, and I enjoyed this book. It shows us that we need to be able to help ourselves, before we can help anyone else."
5,Voo Doo Bop moves close to the top!,"They've done it again! The boys from the big easy have made another leap out of the box, and into the future. In comparison to earlier efforts, Voo Doo Bop is more daring. It includes elements of live performance and free form exploration not fully evident on their prior release, Elevado. They are obviously commign of age in the recording studio, as this CD evidences no holding back from what, and who they are as individuals and a musical collective. AND...Johnny gets to sing! Each member represents himself well, and all but one are represents with compositions. (Next time, Tork?) Buy the disc, and hold on. You will learn why ""The Queen is Slave to No Man."""
2,suspicious substitute bags.,"Bags showed up in mailbox in a prompt manner. Bags look decent. However.........The bags received are not those shown in product display, and don't bear the Panasonic brand name. They are manufactured by DVC Brand. They bear the marks U, U3, & U6. The main reason I ordered these exact bags was that the product display matched the original equipment bags that came with my vacuum. I feel that this vendor is being somewhat devious by substitution of a different product. Proceed with caution."
1,Warning! This book is awful!,"Worst coverage of any book I've ever used. I'm a big fan of the Mike Myers Passport books but I guess they don't make a 70-296 book and a colleague recommended Exam Cram. Don't waste your time or money on this one. I don't know if all Exam Cram books are as bad as this one, this was the first I ever purchased. Maybe it was just this author?? I also bought the Microsoft Press 70-296 book. Much better coverage and a far more knowledgeable author."
2,Definately not a one-stop study guide ....,"This was the second study guide I purchased to help with the 70-296 test (after failing the actual test a couple of times).The book reading wasn't in-depth as I had thought it might be (MS Press 70-292/296 Training Guide was the first book I used).I was definately disappointed in the CD-ROM material. If you're looking for practice exams: move on, look at another product because this isn't it. Their practice test contains 65 questions, that's it. Oh, there's a teaser to purchase more questions but 296 isn't on their list.IMHO, this book isn't for an in-depth review of areas that might crop up in the 296 test. And as I mentioned before, forget the practice tests -- go out to Transcender instead."
4,"Very sturdy, but also quite heavy.","This is a good ironing board if you are wanting something heavy duty and far from the typical ""rickety"" type.The board is quite broad and the pad allows plenty of steam to go thru.I took one star away due to the platform/hanger in the back getting in the way of actually using the back of the board, which I used to iron the backs of my button up shirts on my other ironing boards.I would have taken another away for the weight, but they added small wheels to ease moving.I can suggest this board to anyone who wants a ""beefy"", stable ironing board. But If I could do it over again I would have invested in a deticated ironing station."
5,Heavy Duty,"This ironing board is awesome, it is very heavy duty and well made, not inexpensive bujt well worth the money"
2,Portrait of the Artist as a Madman,"Hmmm...am I the only person who saw the ending coming pretty early on in this story? Though well done, this was just a detailed depiction of a dopey guy going nuts. But Goldman does have a point about those dummys--they sure do seem sinister, like they're itching to commit...murder."
3,Magic,"Mine is more of a question---I read Magic when I was a teen and it scared me pretty bad. I just re-watched the movie with Anthony Hopkins and it doesn't seem like what I rememeber way back when. I seem to remember a scary movie about a ventriloquist doll that chanted ""abracadabra, (something) and hocus pocus, I see you die."" Is this one and the same?"
4,"Good, Interesting Book","A long-forgotten little gem of William Goldman's, it's becoming more and more difficult to find this book anywhere. I was lucky to have found my copy in the library. The book is both very funny, touching and violent, with moments of brilliant humor, suspense and romance scattered throughout. Goldman can make a somewhat silly idea seem unquestionably plausible. The book switches back and forth from present time to the past, then back to present time. Also, the movie (starring Anthony Hopkins and Ann-Margret) is wonderful if you can find a copy as they too are scarce. Great to read and watch if you can find copies."
4,Great psychological horror novel,"Too bad this book from novelist/screenwriter William Goldman has fallen out of print. This is great psychological horror that reads fast (most of the book is dialogue) and has some genuine creepy moments. It's a kind of combination of Jekyll & Hyde meets The Tell Tale Heart mixed with magic and ventriloquism. It seems a mixed bag, but it works.If you like the other horror books of the '70's -- The Other; Rosemary's Baby; The Exorcist; Carrie -- then you'll like this one. I've read people complain that this is like a long Twilight Zone episode, but since when is that a bad thing? The jekyll and hyde theme is one of the most basic in all of literature. And creepy dolls are SCARY! Try to find this at your local library, used book store, or garage sale. It's a great weekend read."
2,Worked great until it broke,"I loved this product, but after a few months, the bottom popped off while I was pumping it. I don't believe that I over pumped it - I just think it's not stong enough to hold the pressure."
2,Great before it broke!,"This product was great before it broke after 6 months of use. I had contemplated buying a few more for different oils, but it recently sprung a leak in the bottom. What a bummer! It sprayed great and never clogged, but one day it just stopped working and had leaked all over the place. I had even taken extra precaution by releasing any extra pressure by unscrewing the cap after using it, because I had read about sprayers that would stop working right. But maybe the other reviewer is right about the oil eating through, because the leak is right at the seam."
4,Great Product,This little sprayer is great. After reading the reviews I bought this one for my wife. It has worked great and we ordered a second.
1,Broke within one month,I was pumping it and the bottom blew off and left oil all over myself and the kitchen. I've haven't even had this thing for a month.
1,Leaked from day one,"I've used the brushed aluminum misters from Misto previously, and the one I used for quite a few years finally got clogged. Bought this as a replacement, and noticed the very next day after first use that it was leaking from the bottom all over the counter.From the other reviews, this appears to happen more often than not."
1,Not very good,"I was hoping this would take the place of my Pam, but the spray is splotchy and very little comes out with each pump. I used canola oil in it. I do not recommend it and I would not buy it, if I had it to do over."
3,"very nice, if it doesn't break.","I am on my second one of these. The first broke within 3-4 months. The second has been going strong for 7-8 months now. If you don't break it, it is great."
1,OK - but not the whole truth,This book really gives you important facts about the threat of millions of illegal immigrants in this county. But I think the book should also talk about legal immigration. I am an immigrant from Germany and my goal was to become an American and leave everything else behind. I promised to never rely on any welfare and in all the past decades I never have. There are rarely people who recognize that I wasn't born here.
5,Can't beat it!,"This snake cable works great, doing exactly what I need it to do. I'm using it to send eight channels of audio from a Carvin mixer into a Zoom R24. It's a great cable for the price!"
2,The Incredible So-Whatness of Being,"I was lured into reading Under the Volcano after seeing its inclusion on the Modern Library's One Hundred Best of the 20th Century and after reading a reviewer compare it to James Joyce (I am an amateur Joycean who tries to read Ulysess, Portrait of the Artist, and Dubliners at least annually). Lowry has nothing that likens him to Joyce. This book is leaden and tedious. I forced myself to finish it because I hate to start a book and not finish it. But it was no labor of love. It was simply a labor."
2,Very Slow......,Positives: Lowry writes a very good insight about an alcoholic's existence. Also the descriptions of the scenery make me want to travel to Mexico and view it myself.Negatives: I found myself begging the book to end from the halfway point. Too much imagery and not enough substance to the story. You better be up on your Spanish too.
5,the best,"Along with Sometimes a Great Notion, An American Tragedy and From Here to Eternity, this is the greatest novel I have ever read."
5,This is an exceedingly beautiful novel.,"To focus on the picture and miss the brush strokes, I think, is to miss the point. To spend your whole life and all you could produce is one beautiful sentence, would that be enough? Or a whole novel of beautiful sentences? If this is all you had to recommend you, your entry into heaven would be guaranteed. Mr. Lowry probably finds heaven boring. I think the fact that there is not a real plot points to the fact the writing is what matters here. This is an exceedingly beautiful novel. I read some sentences over and over again in wonder. I read the sentences to my 8 and 10 year old who found them fascinating."
4,Self destruction in T-minus 12 hours....,"Under the Volcano is a complex and beautifully written novel about one man's pitiful course towards destruction. Rich with dark portents, immense detail, and symbolism; its tragedy will draw forth uneasy laughter and unrestrained sympathy from the reader. ..."
2,Verbose stream-of-consciousness,"Interesting book, but very stream-of-consciousness. Knowing French, Spanish, German and Hindi would also be helpful here. If you liked Ulysses or Sound and the Fury (and I sure don't) then this is for you. Too many other good books to read out there!"
3,The (Mostly) Dormant Volcano,"This is a well respected book often mentioned in the same breath as Ulysses, and (somewhat) deservedly so. The prose is rich, the setting inspired, and the dialogue, at times, is world-class. But it's not a completely untarnished gem. The narrative is stodgy at times, and the plot was presumably ignored by the author in sake of character development. There are other similar books that I enjoyed more. For a study in self-destruction, Hunger is vastly superior. For a jumbled, three-way love affair, Greene's Heart of the Matter is far more polished. There are some brilliant moments in this novel, but they are surrounded by too much overly dense prose and unfocused narrative. It's a decent enough book, but the good things it does are done better elsewhere."
3,Under the Volcano by Malcolm Lowry,"This is a most discouraging and yet thoughtful novel. Set in 1938 in a small Mexican village it tells of one day in the life of Geoffrey Firmin, a perpetually inebriated ex-British consul, his estranged wife, his half-brother, and his friend, a French film director. At the simplest level the day consists of the relationship among these characters. But the narrative leads one to consider any number of more complicated issues. The social conditions of rural Mexico, the abuse by the legal establishment, the social/economic/political upheaval in Europe, questions of individual self-respect and motivation, trudging group nihilism, apparent drug-induced lucidity, the futile efforts of marital reconciliation are but a few. It is a bit like Hemingway, but not as direct; more complex, like Joyce. One comes away defeated, what's the use? ""Someone threw a dead dog after him down the ravine."""
1,caveat emptor,"BEWARE this wretched edition of an otherwise unique novel. There are typographic errors on virtually every page. Some of them (""himse;f"") suggest that an earlier text was scanned for this reprint. But if so, it's clear that the publisher didn't bother to have anyone proofread it. With some books it's easy to spot typos, but not _Under the Volcano_: in part because much of it is written from a perspective of maximum alcoholic intoxication, so you'd be justified in thinking the sloppy spelling is somehow meant to approximate that state of mind; but the typos are also misleading because the text is filled with obscure references and a medley of foreign languages. If you're really intent on reading Lowry's masterpiece, find an old hardback or look for the British Penguin edition. This one's a wreck."
1,Can't go any further,"I slogged through the first 100 pages and ave decided to give up. I spent the last 3 days trying to get into this book and from what I can tell it's not getting better. Long, confusing sentences, lots of symbolism and detail with no discernible plot. I don't care about any of the characters because I can barely figure out what they are thinking/doing. Another overrated ""masterpiece."""
2,100 Words or Less,"Wow ... but not in a good way. My reaction to Lowry's novel is a realization that page after page of such stylized writing, such carefully written sentences, is packed with so much. Too much.It's all a rush of style but so little substance. The struggle to wind my way through this maze removes any hope of actually enjoying the characters or plot. It's dense. It's thick. It's convoluted. It's so overwhelmingly heavy that it sinks with each minute. Ugh."
2,Couldn't read it,"I found this book very uninteresting and difficult reading. The sentences seemed to me unnecessarily complex and circuitous. The story itself did not compel my interest enough to make the effort worth while. Therefore, I have not finished it and probably will not."
2,Miserable lives,"Miserable lives. Miserable lives lived in a miserable place. Miserable lives lived miserably in a miserable place.If you are not depressed before you start this book, rest assured that you will be if you see this book to its end."
2,"Well written, but too much innerthought","The author has a great way with words, but most words are inside the head of the characters.I had to put this book down a few times because I found it dragging and I could only handle so many inner-thoughts. There are moments where pages are the result of a moment's thought. I found myself speeding through to get to the next moment of the story.I can see the author is talented, but this is not my style of read and I cannot say I enjoyed this read."
2,Underwhelming volcano,"My immediate and continuing impression of the book was: This is the work of an amateur, and should never have been published. It's tedious, poorly executed and unsatisfactory in every way."
5,A convincing tour through a troubled mind,"Under the Volcano takes the reader through the troubled thoughts of Geoffrey Firmin, a British ex-Consul who destroys his life with alcohol. Firmin's wasted brilliance is exposed in between drunken musings and misapprehensions. He is accompanied in his travels by his ex-wife (who, in trying to save him, in a way does the opposite) and half-brother.Some passages can be hard to get through (at least one sentence took half a page), but they are well worth it."
5,"Lowry spells ""fart"" P-H-A-R-T...","This book is a complete masterpiece. No question about it. However, if someone told me they'd tossed it after five pages, I'd understand totally. Not that there is an intellectual baseline for enjoying it; rather, it's a question of the style of book one enjoys. This book is an elegy, a tone poem, prose for the sake of prose. Where one word suffices, Lowry inserts two. Where one metaphor is appropriate, Lowry inserts three. The stylization and the facility with words are the genius of the book, not the plot. (A drunk guy drinks a lot, interacts with his ex-wife and half-brother, then is shot by a policeman.) You'll know quickly whether this is your cuppa. Even if it isn't (as it isn't mine), the slog through pays dividends."
1,"Great Novel, Crappy Edition","Under the Volcano is a great novel--one of my favorites. But this edition has many, many spelling errors and typos...so many that they're a distraction. It's a shame, because otherwise I think this edition's design is clean and very readable. Definitely read the book if you're interested, but not this edition."
3,All the more surprising then was it form him to discovery,"I really can't complain enough about the editing of the Harper Perennial edition of this book. As you get near the center of the novel, typos, dropped letters, misspelled and lost words just start to multiply. The title above is only a portion of a sentence I found on page 168, which reads, in its entirety, ""All the more surprising then was it form him to discovery it his duty each day to heave vast quantities of this miraculous food over the side."" I think vast quantities of the NOVEL have been heaved over the side. Something happened. Whoever did the editing job was either asleep or angry, since the book reads like the task was performed either as an act of somnambulism or willful revenge. (Thankfully I have an older copy to consult when things get hazy.)That said, Under the Volcano is an otherwise extraordinary book. Just find yourself an old Penguin edition at your local used bookstore."
2,Not too happy !!!!!,I put this on as soon as I got it and it almost completely broke. The seam on it broke and the the material started tearing. I was so excited about getting this and now that I have it I already need a new one because it is broken.
2,Big disappointment,"I bought this steering wheel cover about a year ago. it looked amazing before I put it on the wheel. It was exactly what I wanted but...getting it on the steering wheel was extremely difficult and I was never able to get it on completely straight. Also, the white edging around the stars started peeling off almost immediatel. Now the seams are coming apart and the little bit of stuffing in it is coming out."
5,Excellent Map,Map holds up well due to lamination. Easy to read. Has all bus and transit lines. Have used it for over 4 months since I moved to San Francisco and it is still like new.Highly recommend this map.
1,could not read it,the map was unreadable........... I could not locate any street or transit station.......I could not find fisherman's wharf orheight ashbury
4,Handy,We used this map on our recent week long trip to the city. We like to walk and it was super helpful to help in our 5 hour walks around the city. The only bummer was that I wish it showed more of Daly City at the southern edge a bit south of San Francisco State University.
5,Very Durable,"I took this map on a backpacking trip in CA, it held up throughout being repeatedly stuffed into an overfilled pack and pulled out multiple times daily when we were in the city. One of the most helpful aspects is the inclusion of the BART and MUNI lines. I don't know how we would have survived without it! This map was our lifeline when we were navigating through San Francisco."
3,hard to read,The scale on this map is tiny. You will need very good eyes to read it while walking. Do not try to read it while driving.
4,excellent map!,"Handy map, with excellent info on bus routes and all manners of public transit!!!! Can't do without this map if you're on your own and want to use public transit!"
2,"Hard to read, not recommended for tourists","I found it difficult to read. The colors are much darker than in the product image, and it's hard to read black type on darkly colored backgrounds. Most maps use light backgrounds with crisp, black type for optimal contrast.I also found it difficult to scan. Tourists don't necessarily need to know all the street names, they just need a general guide that highlights main roads and neighborhoods. I think this one has too much info for the average visitor and ends up making the map crowded.If I'd just moved to SF, this would probably be a great guide because it packs so much detail into a small space. But I don't recommend it for tourists.The best map I've seen so far (for tourists) is the one that comes withFodor's San Francisco 2012: with the Wine Country (Full-color Travel Guide). Unfortunately the map can't be purchased without the book but it's a pretty good book to have anyway."
2,Inaccurate,"I bought this map as I am a new resident of the city. I tried to use it to navigate around the Twin Peaks neighborhood and it got me lost. Streets on the map are not in the city. Streets in the city are not on the map. I got home and checked maps.google and sure enough, Streetwise just has it wrong. Maybe other parts of the city are better but I had a similar experience in Diamond Heights only I blamed myself. Now I'm wondering if it was the map."
1,Free maps that the SF hotels give out are just as good,"And while the laminate would be nice in the rain, I guess, it makes it bulky to carry around."
2,Not a great tourist map,I have an awesome laminated map of S.F.San Francisco Map & Guide Pocket-Pilotbut it is several years old and I have a trip planned for next month and wanted an updated version but the one I have is no longer being published so I bought this one since it was fairly updated. I am very disappointed in this map. It is good if you are just wanting a street map that includes transit. I was looking for more of a tourist map that was easier to read while out and about. The ironic thing is this map has a small section of Chinatown & Union Square that is exactly the type map I wanted but for a larger area. The map is laminated and folded with 7 panels on each side. It is a decent map if you are looking for a particular street but the print is small and it covers a large area on two sides with a good portion of one side taken up with the street index. I was disappointed that Amazon didn't have a larger selection of S.F. tourist maps that are current.
3,"Good wine book for your coffee table, but not for beginners","This book is packed with beautiful pictures and some good information on wines. If you want to learn more about wines, this book is beneficial if you're already at an intermediate level of wine knowledge; if you're a wine novice who wants to learn the basics and how to taste wines, this is NOT THE BEST book to get.Pros on the book: Stylish, beautiful pictures. The author offers a tasting wheel, which displays the various flavors that you should taste for the respective wine varieties.Cons on the book: A little disorganized; not detailed enough; does not go through the basics.Overall: Big on style, a bit boring to read. Good for those with intermediate wine knowledge. Looks great on coffee table."
3,Barenboim needs to loosen up,"On the good side, Barenboim avoids use of the pedal and plays all the right notes. Everything is clean and clear. I suppose clarity was the primary goal in his interpretation. However, this over-emphasis on clarity made for an extremely dry rendition. The third movement was the worst, missing the sweep that is so crucial to this fluent score. The dynamics, as part of this problem of dryness, were flat. This is supposed to be Romanticism in its full bloom. Where's the optimism, the lyrical tenderness, and unfettered passion? Not in this recording.I cant make an educated opinion about the du Pre performance."
4,**New strategies ** for success by Tracy,"Although some of what Tracy has written in this book is similiar to what he has written before, there is also much more new information. What I like most about Brian Tracy is that he spends a considerable amount of time studying the most modern material to help make you successful. Brian's material is fresh and up to date."
5,SPLENDID BOOK,"I have read this book over and over again, and my life has never been the same. Through the book, Brian Tracy splendidly teaches how to develop habits leading to greatness.By Wilbert R. Mutoko - Speaker and Author of 15 Secrets for Personal Financial Success, A Simple Step-by-Step for Financial Freedom"
5,quality and motivational read,"Very easy to read, you can pick it up at any point. Not only for sales people, you can take parts of the book no matter what you do in life. Nothing groundbreaking - but the message is delivered very well."
3,Fantastic,"This DVD is 32 minutes of Frank Gilbreths original time and motion studies. All are original B/W no sound movies from around WW I. It's amazing how much different professions Gilbreth has studied to try to improve the skills. Not just manufacturing, but baseball, surgeons and even soldiers.If you are interested in history and historical images of the early time and motion studies, then this video is absolutely for you. For most people, it will probably be an old movie with people repeating the same moves with a clock next it.I liked it a lot. It makes time/motion studies and that part of history more concrete and clear.Thus for most people, probably only 3 or 2 stars. If you like these things, 4 or even 5 stars. I averaged out to 3."
2,Product Literally Stinks,"The shower curtain looks as advertised, but has a terrible odor that is still lingering many weeks after installation. Even after I left the ventilation fan running for several days, the room is almost uninhabitable. I don't recommend buying this product unless you have a window in the bathroom that opens and don't need to use the room for at least a week."
3,It's Just The Dub Foundation,"I have to say, if you're a fan of ADF avoid being disappointed.They've lost their soul. ADF should consider dropping Asian since all I hear is the usual jungle, dub and rasta with some metal guitars."
3,NOT DUB,"this is fast paced techno with lots of vocals and mediteranean, asian, and reggae influences. not what i expect from their title. its like buying ""dub syndicate"" and getting heavy metal. preview at least 1 of the songs before buying as they are all very similar, and similarly paced. song 8 take back the power is their best.. very far from dub. they should get zero stars for having such a misrepresentative name"
3,Not a bad addition to your collection ...,"I own several Bing Crosby Christmas albums and was pleasantly surprised to find several recordings on ""Bing Crosby & Friends"" that I had never heard before. The recording quality is so-so, but consider the age of these tracks. I don't want to be the Grinch, but my major gripe: a useless CD booklet. Couldn't the record company at least tell me when each track was recorded and exactly who is singing along with Bing? Maybe include some photos? Happy Holidays"
4,Just what I needed,"Keeps all those credit card size cards, (insurance, rewards, airline etc. . .), organized in one place, in a convenient carry. Good quality. Card slots are tight, but should loosen over time."
5,Wallet is amazing!,This was just what I have been looking for. I am replacing one I bought years ago. It is very sturdy. A wonderful product.
4,very competitively priced female jazz voval collection,"This is a sort of problematic collection consisting of the originals from which the Verve Remixed disk remixes were derived. Ten of the twelve cuts are female jazz vocalists bookended by Willie Bobo's opening cut ""Spanish Grease"" and the closing chanting of Tony Scott's ""Hare Krishna."" If one just thinks of it as a female jazz vocalist compilation (or if one is energetic enough to program the player so that it becomes a female jazz vocalist compilation), it is enjoyable though not definitive. The Willie Bobo cut stands out because it isn't female jazz vocals, but it's a nice tune. Tony Scott's chanting will probably send many listeners scrambling for the eject button."
4,180 degrees from the Verve Remixed CD,"This is a CD comprised of original versions of the 12 songs that appear on the critically-lauded Verve Remixed CD. The music here stands in stark contrast to the reworking of the material on the Remixed CD, and can only be safely recommended for people who are either so curious about where the music for the better known CD came from, or are SERIOUS jazz heads. The tone is 180 degrees away from te Remix CD, but the power of the old songs in undeniable, just not necessarily for anyone who's not into jazz."
5,Excellent counterpoint to the Verve Mixed disk,Most purchasers of the Mixed disk will be unfamiliar with the original Jazz standards versions of the songs. This CD exists to fill in that gap. It's hard to make a direct comparison between the dance and the jazz versions. Each in its own place I'd say. Great music regardless of the technology or the era. This disk highlights that good music is forever.
3,Wasn't blown away...,"Nice group of players, yet it wasn't exactly what I was hoping for in terms of fingerstyle technique."
4,If your into acoustics this is for you.,This CD will fill your head with great acoutic sounds and clears your mind for possitive thinking and relaxation.
5,Unnerving and creepy,"This is my first novel by Ramsey Campbell, but most assuredly it will not be my last. Amy Priestly and her widowed father Oswald are headed toward a collision course with unnamed horrors, all of which reside in their home of Nazarill. I admit that it took me awhile to get into this novel, the style of writing is often difficult, especially the cadence of Oswald which only grows more archaic as the story progresses. The final few chapters are superb, with the level of tension building to an almost unbearable climax. If you are looking for a well written horror story that delivers, this one does the genre proud."
4,Disturbing,"Nazareth Hill is without a doubt one of Campbell's finest works. The story is very well written and keeps the reader interested despite some moments that drag. The overall story makes you ignore the slow moments simply because the reader want's to find out what happens next.Now i should warn most of the horror fan's like myself out there that this really is not a typical haunted house story. When some of the events that take place in the book happen they will downright bother you, i sure know they bothered me a great deal. This is not for the faint of heart and the way this book ends will not please a great many people.I recommend this book to any horror fan out there simply because you probably won't read anything similar out there with the exception of King's The Shining, but even saying that King's novel doesn't hold a candle to the outright brutality that takes place here. Enjoy...."
4,"Very creepy, indeed!","This is the first book I've read by Ramsey Campbell and I have to say I was rather impressed. The writing showed talent and focus, though as an American it took me a little time to get used to the very British cadence, especially in the dialog. This book is the kind of horror I like best. It's scary because we can identify with the characters who find themselves in this impossible situation. I never felt like the ""idiot plot"" was in effect -- you know, the feeling that everyone's just too stupid to save themselves? Not a problem here. More than anything this book reminded me of early Steven King (especially The Shining). After trying to get through Bag of Bones and giving up after the first quarter of it, I'm happy to have Mr. Campbell to go to now for a good scare."
5,horror at a slow boil,"This is only the second Campbell book I've read and already he's one of my favorite authors. I find him fabulously able at writing suspenseful scenes that make me cringe (in a good way!). ""Nazareth Hill"" caught me unawares -- a rare, ""slow-boil"" horror novel in this time of easy, in-your-face, bombastic scares. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,Waste of money,"I wish I had read customer comments more closely and saved money on this book. If you want to read it, get it at a library and spend your money for a better book. I love Ramsey Campbell as an author, but he sure missed it on this one. Much too slow moving and extremely hard to get into."
3,"Entertaining, but not a masterpiece.","I'm finding it difficult to be terrified by fiction these days. Nazareth Hill is entertaining, the psychological excalation somewhat fun, and its elusive gore-ghosts neat to watch out for. Its conclusion is inevitable--though not down to the least detail, nevertheless inevitable. Some of the metaphors, especially the more obvious spider one, feel ocassionally forced...the inevibility of once being trapped, eventually undergoing the torture of desanguination--i.e., you will die...The language in this book is pretty smart, pretty formal--sometimes not stage-shy enough.This is the story of Nazareth Hill. The ghosts are incidental in a sense to human psychological makeup. And this view leads to my primary criticism: fleshless ghosts reign a-okay, but other characters could be more fleshed out. After all, the more critical demons reside in their own hearts and heads, not in the walls of Nazareth Hill."
5,"Unnerving, devastating... unforgettably sublime","A real gem of occult horror.Is teenage Amy psychically sifting in time to relive the torments of the dead of Nazareth Hill? Is it a vicious scheme to drive his fragile and stubborn dad out of his wits? Is this a revenge from beyond the grave?In the grand gothic tradition of James' ""Turn of the Screw"", the fine line between reality and nightmare is blurred, and soon enough the reader is trapped in a downward spiral that picks up speed to collide in a shocking, eye-widening and unforgettable conclusion.A must read for the horror fan."
3,Disturbing and Suprising,"First the bad news: Nazareth Hill was slow and way too lengthy (this story could have been told in about half the pages). And now for the good news: It was pretty gruesome and scary, with a suprising twist to it. What I expected to read was not what I actually read, and I like it when someone throws me the unexpected. A very dark and disturbing read if your patient enough to stick with it."
1,Poorly written and edited,"This book is flat-out terrible. The writing is poor, it seems like no one ever bothered editing it, and the contributions from the various converts are at best incoherent. Each chapter is supposed to be the ""story"" of a different convert, but one chapter is a stream-of-consciousness random thoughts about the sunrise, another is a pretty incoherent back-and-forth between conversion and loving your parents. It is completely unsuccessful in presenting a clear rationale for conversion or frankly, even presenting an interesting story or two. Awful."
5,Handwriting of the Famous and Infamous,I love this book! It is very well done and I also love the photographs that appear along with the handwriting sample. Great pics of the individuals. Thanks to Sheila for putting this book together. A wonderful addition to my ever-growing selection of analysis books. Aysa Armitage
5,Compelling and incredibly Interesting!,"Handwriting of the Famous and Infamous by Sheila Lowe has brought me hours of entertainment. I spent so much time comparing my handwriting to that of the various personalities in her book. Then, once I found some similar, I read everything that Sheila wrote about the handwriting sample in the book to see if I shared any of the qualities. I did this completely for entertainment's sake ... NOT for analysis of any kind. For that I would just refer to my copy of The Complete Idiots Guide to Handwriting Analysis.Definitely a great book to have on the coffee table. It has generated many interesting conversations.I highly recommend this book!"
4,Great pop-dance cd!,"Step One, is a great dance-pop cd. It's full of peppy tunes to keep you dancing. The best tracks on here are probably Say You'll Be Mine, One for Sorrow, Better the Devil. If you like acts like Britney Spears, Nsync, and Mandy Moore than you will like Steps too."
5,This is sheer talent.,"This album combines many stlyles of music into one. In a word, it's techno-pop. But Steps isn't like the faceless talent that's going around these days. This group combines great dance beats with truly wonderful, inspiring lyrics. Not only are the lyrics and music fantastic, the vocalists are greatly gifted. How gifted? They would sound great even with no music playing in the background. If you like modern, talent-beyond- compare music, pick this up. You'll be glad you did."
4,ABBA Returns!,"That's right. These young folks sound like a ""Fresh"" Abba. The songs are catchy and fresh and danceable. A pretty decent cd. I enjoy it!"
5,BACK FOR REVIEW NUMBER TWO.....,Well fellow surfers I have follow this group on both albums and the U.S. version has three new songs which are very good. Let me tell you when I marry in the future I will plan on using steps to tell her how I really feel about her. Just like Abba told us in the 80's..
2,Step One review,"They must be really desprate to get fans in the US. Instead of releasing the original Step One they decided to release one with the songs that got into the British top 75 singles.Unless you can't find any other things you wanna buy, don't buy it. If you really wanna listen to the songs, go to stepsofficial.com(30 secs) or steptastic.co.uk(full track & music videos)"
1,what a load of TAT,this music is an abomination. i think that music produced by the corporate machine known as steps is full of the stuff that comes out of the rear ends of dogs. i think that tragedy is the biggest monstrosity since depeche mode. this is shameful to everyone who buys it. the only good thing about steps is that they cannot live forever
3,"Okay, but Steptacular is better","I bought this because I enjoyed Steptacular so much, but I have to concede that this album is nowhere near as good. It's okay to listen to in the background, but even by the fourth time through there is no track here, which makes me stop what I'm doing to just listen. Single releases such as One For Sorrow, Last Thing On My Mind and Better Best Forgotten are good to hear again, though I have to admit to hating 5-6-7-8. Track 6, This Heart Will Love Again, is particularly good: I'd suggest it's the best on the album, and the final track is also worth a listen. But who decided to include that first one-minute track Steptro! At least I'm listening to this on my PC's CD drive, so I can programme out that track! As for Tragedy, included on the US edition of this album, can I please wipe that from my memory! They haven't a clue what it's about, and their rendition gives about as much sense of tragedy as their inane grins. The BeeGees' version was far better."
4,ABBA with a contemporary beat...STEPtacular!,"This is a collection of bubbly pop songs heavily influenced by the `70s quartet ABBA, but augmented with a contemporary dance/pop beat. Tracks such as ""5, 6, 7, 8"", ""One For Sorrow"" and ""Last Thing On My Mind"" are great, fun dance tracks that will get you up on the floor in a heartbeat. Speaking of ""Heart Beat"", that song is one of the stand out slow songs on the CD, where the ladies of Steps show that they CAN sing. Other standout tracks, particularly for their ABBA-ness, are ""Love's Got A Hold On My Heart"", ""After The Love Has Gone"", and a cover of the BeeGees' ""Tragedy"". This release should signal the beginning of a fruitful career for this British band."
5,Love the CD....tour the US!,I have seen Steps live in London and can't get enough from this group. They play to the fans and can get the house rocking. The female members have incredible voices and I hope the songs written for the male members can show off their voices better on the next CD. I am also a big fan of ABBA and enjoy Steps' ability to use those successful sounds in the new millenium. I have both CD's that Steps has made (which were bought in the UK) and really enjoy the energy and youthfulness they share with their fans. I do hope as the group matures they can begin to work on a more sophisicated sound and send deeper messages to their fans. The dance songs are great for parties and their ballads do hit the heart strings. I am in my mid thirties and truely enjoy Steps and eargerly await their next CD! It is music for the young at heart. When will a tour hit the US?
4,"Love Steps, look for the UK releases","I am 31 years old and still love these teenybopper groups. Must be due to too much exposure in the 80's to Erasure, Depeche Mode, Duran Duran, etc.Steps are not quite in the same league as those guys but the music is infectious and fun. And unlike some of the other teenybopper recipe groups, these girls can really sing. It will certainly be a frequent CD in my car stereo.For some reason unfathomable to me, the US version of Step One is a ""combo"" of their top singles from their two UK albums (Step One and Steptacular). You can get either from amazon.co.uk for just a little more than this album in the USA. Anyone who is a fan of this group should take that avenue."
5,New Age Generation Rules!,"This new young generation style of upbeat positive, nonviolent hits is sure to be a winner...fast. The song ""One For Sorrow"" should be a definate hit and take over the charts at #1 soon. Welcome to America Steps!"
5,STEPS ARE THE BEST EVER,EVERY SONG ON THIS CD WAS REALL Y CATCHY . THE MUSIC IS A MIX OF LOVE DANCE AND POP MUSIC. IT WAS REALLY WELL WORTH BUYING
5,Steps to the Stars,"I got this CD about 2 weeks ago when it was finally debuted in the US. Steps is hugely famous in the UK and now I can see why! This album is so awesome. It's all upbeat songs, some about love, some about sorrow, and even an old Bee Gee favorite that they beautifully remake. I really enjoyed this album! If you like N'SYNC and Brittany Spears, you'll love Steps!"
1,This Album is Better best forgotton!,"Tragedy? you took the words out of my mouth. As your typical polite Englishman I must inform all you lovely Americans that this is the biggest pile of [rubbish] since the Spice girls brought us SPICE. But if this is your type of thing then buy it. But please listen to it alone, for god sake don't inflict it on others. I feel like I have a duty to inform America about British acts but this is the sort of thing that makes me ashamed to be English"
5,Steps the UK Pop Phenomenon,"Steps first US album Step One is just the beginning of what they have in store for us Americans. It starts with the BeeGee's classic ""Tragedy,"" which is brilliantly remade the fivesome. It gets into the ""upety, bouncy"" ""Say You'll Be Mine"" and into the ever classic ""One For Sorrow."" ""Last Thing On My Mind"" and ""Stay With Me"" are pop filled songs that are followed up by ""Love's Got A Hold On My Heart."" These three songs are very catchy. ""After The Love Has Gone"" has a very Asian feel to it. ""Heartbeat,"" one of my favorites, is a pop/rock song. It shows off their talent in harmonies and as individual singers. ""Deeper Shade Of Blue"" is one of the best songs on the album. It is very dancy. The final song is a remake of Abba's ""Better The Devil You Know,"" again a great song that shows off their ability to harmonize. This is a great album, which is the beginning of more to come. I recommend this album to anyone who wants to dance!"
2,Disappointing CD,I have several of the Hearts of Space Collection discs. I was disappointed with this one. It was dull. The music had no energy to it unlike some of the other HoS discs.
4,better than expected,"i didnt even kno this show had an album it has alot of the goodmusic featured in the show including the shows version of ""im ready"" completely different from the itunes version or the original..better^^i was very pleased with it"
4,Love Kim Possible!,"I LOVE Kim Possible (at 40 years old with no children!).The theme song is the reason I bought this CD, but I was excited that ""The Naked Mole Rap"" is on here too. I LOVE Rufus!I was looking forward to hearing the theme song exactly as on the show, however the 3 versions on this CD are NOT the version in the show (hence, the 4 stars instead of 5). :-(But the tracks I really enjoy are:It's Just You (upbeat song about how great Kim is - go Kim!)I'm Ready (graduation from high school)Get Up on Ya Feet (upbeat song from ... ?? Great beat!)Say the Word (Kim sings this at her ""talent show"" at school)Could it Be (when Kim & Ron finally hook up at the dance)The Naked Mole Rap (GO RUFUS!)Rappin' Drakken (Go Drewbie!)All in all a great purchase.(I found the show version of ""Call Me Beep Me"" online somewhere, so I have my complete Kim Possible library.)Sad the show has ended, but glad to have the music from it. Enjoy!"

2,Not Great,"If you are looking for a lightweight thin plastic/rubber molded liner, then this is your product. If you are looking for heavy duty all rubber liner that will hold itself in place and not bubble up in the middle and slip around, look elsewhere. This liner is light weight and of what appears to be a mostly plastic with a little rubber mixed in. The price for this is in line with an all rubber heavy mat, not a piece of thin plastic. When I installed this, it will not sit tight against the molding under it. It is rigid plastic, so it wont lay and hold flat. Not impressed for what you pay for this. If it was only about $35 to $40 I would have given it 4 stars because this is what you would expect to get at the price point."
5,Perfect Fit for 07 Tahoe LT,This fit perfect in my 07 Tahoe LT. I have 3rd row seating that I never keep in the vehicle. This cargo liner is perfect as it molds to the groves from the 3rd row seating. Fits like a glove. Included with the line are directions on how to make cutouts (if you want) so you can install the 3rd row seating over the liner. I'll be purchasing the liners for the 2nd row once I get a few extra bucks. Great product!
4,Great music poor packaging,"Beautiful music. I have no complaints about his work, but why no liner notes? The package was so tight I had to tear it to get the CD out of the package. I give it 5 stars and deduct one for the poor packaging."
5,The Land,The Land is an interesting story that will make you want to read it evrey second of the day.-BW
4,the land review,"I liked the book because it was a very adventures book. She wrote the book about the post civil war. It was about a young colored boy growing in to a man when they were mistreated. There where tragic events in his life were he got beat , his freind getting shot, and his father and mother dying. The conflict of the story is a colored boy growing up in a white mans world. The resolution was he got what he wanted in the end he setteled down with a fine wife, his land, and having a great family."
4,HISTORIAN LAND,This book is a multi cultuer book about how the white people owned the color people.When the none color people owned the color folks they put them into hard slavery.The theme of the book is about a slave owner child who feels bad for his slave.The setting is on a farm where it's a dirty barn house and in the real house the rooms are small.The conflict is that the people besides the boy hit the slave many of times.One specifics about the book is that most of the people in the state love to own the slaves so the white people won't have to all the hard work around the bulding plus so the slaves have to do all the heavy lifting to make a brick wall for the house.I disliked the book cause I did not like the part when the people forced the slaves to do the hard labor.
2,Ummm.. Maybe I missed what was great about the book,"When i heard about Walk Like A Man I was excited, thinking that Ms. Brown was writing an erotica book about lesbians and butch/stud women. But once I started it I almost couldn't get through it. I kept reading it hoping that the next story would be better than the one before, but it just never happened.Some of the sex scenes were alright, but overall it was boring. And the stories involved were even worse. not worth my money."
5,Laurinda D. Brown does it again....,"Another exceptional book by an exceptional author. Ms. Brown combines all the aspects of a good book; romance, danger, mystery,love and drama-How else best to cover the gamut of lesbian relationships as this book does? Short stories of all variations, all surrounding a central theme: love, life and lust in a lesbian relationship. A MUST READ book if you like lesbian erotica and romance."
3,not for me but my partner really likes it,"i read a few stories in this book which was recommended to me by a friend as a ""good read"". however, i could not connect with any of the characters in the stories. mainly because i identify as ""femme"" and many of the characters identify as ""boi, butch, stud"" mentalities. So i passed the book to my partner and she has not put the book down since i gave it to her. i'd say she likes it... :)however, do not pass this book up b/c i couldn't get into it... it obviously has ""something"" to it b/c my partner is an avid reader of lesbian erotica and says she is enjoying it."
5,Need more man walking,This was a good book I enjoyed every story. I would love to read a second one of its kind.
5,Great Look at the 100 Natual Wonders of the World,I was looking through amazon.com for an interesting book on world geography. I saw this book and I noticed this is what I've been looking for all along. Great book for the geography enthusiast and the inquiring minds. BUY IT!
3,The Return Of Sailor Moon,"...First of all, I would just like to point out that this book wasn't written by Naoko Takeuchi. She is Japanese. She lives in Japan....And she has no control over Scholastic or Tracey West, who is the author of ""The Return Of Sailor Moon""(And now,the actual review)I don't think this is the best book to get for someone who is new to Sailor Moon,because the story starts from the second season,which can be pretty confusing if you haven't watched the show before. However,if you are a fan of Sailor Moon,and are not embarassed to read and/or buy picture books,it's worth a look. At least they haven't got Serena wearing clothes from The Gap and listening to the *shudder* Backstreet Boys...Although I didn't understand why they wrote in the theme song at the beginning of the book. That was pretty pointless..."
1,Take it away!,"How I think this works-The Sailor Moon Manga by Naoko Takeuchi-Wonderful.The Japanese Anime-OKThe American Dubbed Version-Just Plain SorryThis Book-HorribleYou notice how it keeps getting worse? I can barely see ANYTHING from the manga in this book. Please Naoko, I beg of you, make it stop!"
2,Trouble,"This is the 2nd time I've purchased this CD & found it faulty. Both times there were so many 'skips' in so many of the pieces, it was ridiculous. Unfortunate, as the few that were OK sounded great! I will NOT try for a 3rd time."
4,Best Free Book ever,"The best Free Kindle book I've read this year. The minute you start this book you are hooked. There are hidden secrets, love, lust and danger from beginning to end. You won't be disappointed."
5,I loved this well-written novel with its great characters,"In my opinion, Ms Jackson is among the finest authors I've had the pleasure to read. Her characters are real and believable. The beginning hook brought tears to my eyes. Kara's mother believed her sacrifice would help the man she loved and that was touching. Kara and Brent are realistic heroine and hero, and I was happy they got together. I don't agree with one reviewer that the senator wouldn't have done the things he did. That person is not living in the real world. I want to read everything Monica Jackson has written. It's about time an author came along who dared break the romance mold and write really terrific novels."
5,Stimulating!!!,"This was one of the best novels I have read in a long time. I especially liked the characters Brent and Kara. I was so elated when they finally got together. However, It was a shame that she found her father was a total jerk!! Because of him, his whole family suffered. Nevertheless, the ending turned out beautifully. This is my first novel by Miss Jackson, and I am looking forward to reading more. Keep up the good work!!"
3,This book was not what I expected.,"Manica Jackson' Heart's Desire was an very time consuming book to read. Although this book is non-fiction, I felt the story line was too too unrealistic. The characters, Kara and Brent were well developed and fun to get to know. The idea of a US Senator going off like that and trying to kill almost everyone in the book was quite unbelievable and unexpected for this type of book. Athough I wanted to put this book down and start another one, my sister loved it and could not and would not put it down. All in all, I would suggest you read this book."
4,"Tons of Fun, but Violent","My eight-year-old loves this game. For about six months straight, this was his favorite game. However, it is a fighting game, so it contains quite a bit of violence. In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have bought this for him, as it seems inappropriate for children under 13. No blood and guts, though."
5,Classic Salsa title,There are not many recordings in this genre that are more important. Outstanding blend of vocal talents and superior musicianship.
3,I like the charecters but it was very perdictable!!!!,This is the First book i have read by Mary Daheim. She is a Good author who makes very good charecter development but she should focus more on the plot and the mystery. I am not a person to give awayt the story or to tell you parts i like and dislikes because that will be something that you will have to decide for yourself. I will continue to read more of her books but i hope her others are a lot more exciting and with alot more twist and turns!!
4,Very entertaining,"This is one of the earlier books in the series. Judith is getting ready for Easter on the Hill. The annual SOTS Easter Egg Hunt is Easter Saturday, so Judith brings some of Gertrude's famous potato salad to the event. Neighbor Wilbur Paine is the Easter Bunny. Judith thought that all had gone pretty well, until she is informed that one of her neighbors, who had just received a big inheritance, was stabbed to death in the nursery. Joe asks for her help and she of course can't say no.This is one of the best books in the series. Judith and Renie's attempts to investigate are hilarious, as are their neighbors and family. Every time I pick up one of Daheim's books I hope for one like this but unfortunately, the later ones are less and less funny and more silly. I hope to find more like this one."
3,Holy Terrors,This is not as good as the other books I have read by Mary Daheim. I get tired of her Mother who is spoiled and selfish and lets Judith do all the work.
2,Holy Terror!,I was less than impressed with Mary Daheim's Holy Terrors. I thought the book description sounded fun and interesting: a murder by a bunny-suit clad perpetrator to be solved by a Bed-and Breakfast owner. I thought this would be a laugh out loud book because a few reviewers described the book as hilarious. I was wrong.I thought there were too many characters. Keeping track of them was a bit cumbersome at first but then the main suspects and characters were more front and center so remembering who is who became easier. I felt the pace dragged a bit and then towards the end came to a screeching halt. I found myself skimming just to move forward and had to go back and re-read. I thought there was a very strong Christian/Catholic influence. I think this book should be listed as Christian Fiction. I understand that this is an older book and earlier in the series so maybe it's not as polished as the later ones.
4,Solid Bunny Read,This is another good read from Mary D. Cousins Judith and Renie entertain you while trying to decipher the Easter Bunny murder.
4,Wow...another winner in Luc's discography,"This one is quite special as it includes' Saliceburry cocktail', probably his last piece (finished one month before Luc's death) and it's a tape and electronics mayhem made in hell and heaven at the same time. A masterpiece of 'modern' electronic / electro acoustic music.The rest of the cd includes 2 other pieces which are more in the 'Presque rien' style of tape and field recording manipulation with minimal electronics. Great too! Recommended!"
4,Difficult music indeed..,"I think you have to know the Shakespeare characters to really get involved with this music, but I'll give it four stars for effort, both from David Tanenbaum and Hans Werner Henze. Certainly any really serious guitarist should check it out just to hear what can be realized on a solo acoustic guitar!"
1,Past expiration date......,Product was received past its expiration date. Product would not harden. I had to go to my local auto shop to purchase new material that WAS NOT past the expiration date. At this time I also realized that I had paid approximately 3 times the regular retail price for a product that did not work. Plus shipping. A waste of money.
5,excellent gps,This is the best GPS system ever. It comes with TTS and has an extra widescreen viewing area. It great for the price and is very accurate. You'll never get lost again!
3,hot rod girls,this movie idea had so much potential with out special effects it didnt really come off very good but for being different with some folks youll never see in movies it worth seeing or buying.
1,Dark and unnerving. A parents nightmare.,"After describing this book to a friend, he said ""Well... why should every book need an upside?""I suppose my friend is correct. This book is recommended if for no other reason than its unwillingness to deliver the expected.This book is disturbing and if you have children, you may wish to skip it. If you can handle the dark side, this book is well written and a quick read.I admit on being torn about recommending this book or not. It certainly made an impression and if a book is rated on how much emotion it elicits from the reader than this book would have to rate a 10. On the other hand, if you rate a book based on the amount of pleasure it gives the reader, I would have to rate this book a 1."
1,How can so many people be so wrong?,"I just finished this book today. Yes it is fast paced. Yes there is a lot of action. Disturbing? I guess so., BUT in truth, I'm embarassed to have spent my time reading this stuff. In general, this book was poorly written. It was impossible to connect with most of the characters. The actions of the main character never really made sense. I found myself asking why he did what he did, and hoping against hope that he'd figure things out, and do the right thing. It never really happens...."
1,Too close to Hemingway for comfort...,"When I initially read this book, I would have given it a higher rating--after all, Mr. Morrell was a prof at U of I; ""First Blood"" was an all-time favorite of mine; and the technical detail of ""Testament"" was superb. BUT... I later read Ernest Hemingway's ""Big Two Hearted River"" for a college lit class. The similarities between Morrell's Rueben dining on ""canned beans and canned spagetti"" were very, um, ""similar"" (eerily so...) to Nick Adam's dining experience in the wilderness of Michigan's Upper Peninulsa... Right down to both characters uttering happily through a mouthful of hot food: ""Crise, Jesus Crise..."" Coincidence? Well, probably--after all, a couple of letters weren't quite the same (sub ""t"" for ""e""). Still, I was pretty disappointed... It certainly tempered my enjoyment of Mr. Moreell's subsequent offerings. Has anyone else ever noted this coincidence??"
5,"The man and his wife, his daughter and his son....","This thrilling and captivating story caught my interest after the first sentence.This is truely a great story of a man struggling to keep himself and his family alive and away from the wrath of a 'violent enemy'. This book is very well written and at the turn of each page you remain spellbound! So involved with this book, I found myself regretting to put it down. You soon find yourself getting wrapped up in David Morrell's plot and you may end up putting off everything in your life just to find out how Reuben Bourne intends to keep his family safe, without being able to trust a living soul...."
2,Starts well.....,"This book starts off real strong.......then it gets a bit unbelievable as the main character, a writer, becomes the best frontiersman ever...comes across a ghost town no one knows about ...... complete with a stranger who lives there of course ....... then the ending falls completely flat. Disappointing for a book that did start off with such a compelling (if disturbing) beginning, especially for a reader with a older daughter and a baby son."
4,Thoroughly depressing.,"It cost me about two dollars for a beat up copy of this book. Gritty story, no apologies, no candy-coating. Has an 80's vibe to it, but I will certainly remember this book for a long time."
2,David Morrell's worst book,I've read many books by David Morrell but this one is the worst. The story is good and I could sympathize with the book's main characters. But the story seems to drag on and on about their never ending escape from the evil white supremacists. The story's ending is unique and very disappointing.
4,very disturbing for a poppa,this is the most upsetting novel i have ever readbrutal violence and unforgettable despairbut some how morrell and his great writing keep me from being upset with himand its a hell of a storyread it at your own risk
1,His worst,"This is a depressing and disappointing book from a really great author. I'm sorry I read it. If you want to believe that there is good in the world, or that adversity can be overcome, do your self a favor and read any other book by David Morrell. Skip this one."
3,Good book w/ a bad ending.,"This book was typical Morrell, impossible to put down. However, I found the ending too be inconsistent. I really feel that the character's final actions did not justify the means for which he traced down the leader. It was disappointing; however, the rest of the story was excellent"
3,So so,"Birelli Lagrene, Steve Grossman, Sarah Lazarus and Philippe Catherine are the pullers for me (having bought many great Dreyfuss recordings), and while they deliver quite well, the overall DVD is a disappointing performance. The selection of songs is ok, but it is of rather a ""spotty"" enjoyment value. Sound and video quality is excellent. Not especially recommended, alas."
3,Insight into a racist doctrine,This is an excellent compendium of information on the Indo-Aryan mythology that inspired Wagner and Hitler and has become a touchstone belief for many modern neo-Nazis and racists. A must study for those wishing to understand and counter their particular form of poison.
1,Racist Drivel,"The mere mention of the name ""Wotan"" in the title of this book dishonors that God, and all those sane individuals who revere him. Make no mistake, this book has NOTHING to do with the pre-christian religious beliefs of Northern Europeans, and is no more a ""holy book"" than Hagar the Horrible is the Pope."
5,GRE Review,"The product consists of a text and DVD. The text is very readable, although some questions run afar from everyday practice except for mathematicians and the engineering sciences. The presentation provides sample reading comprehension and vocabulary consistent with the form and content on the GRE. The mathematics is divided by level of difficulty. i.e. easy, intermediate and difficult questionsThe difficult questions are just that. i.e.GIVEN: Given m+ n = 24 and m - n + p= 15 then 4m + 2p = what numberm+ n = 24m- n + p = 15__________________2m + p= 39 therefore 4m + 2p must be 78The section on vocabulary is helpful to identify typicalwords tested. Overall, the book is excellent; however,parts of the exam are elusive.This is not the fault of the publisher. It is the nature ofthe exam itself. If purchased, the candidate should spend sometime reviewing examination techniques, as well as algebra,geometry and basic statistics.i.e. mean median mode prime numbers"
4,coffee carafe,"Krups 016-70 Coffeemaker/Urn ProCafe 10 Cup Glass Carafe & Lid, White HandleProduct met the description and and worked in the coffe pot"
4,"intense storyline, kind of short","Ana, daughter of Queen Veda, ruler of Ran, has spent the last four years making herself ugly to win her mother's love. She doesn't bathe, keeps her hair unattractively short, and eats only pastries. After four years of this, Ana is convinced that she has finally succeeded in gaining her mother's love. Then she realizes that all of the beautiful girls of Ran are being sent to a prestigious Academy for Girls in the mountains, including her best friend. When Ana is chosen to go as well, she resists for fear of leaving her now-loving mother. But once at the Academy, Ana realizes exactly how much beauty means to her mother, and how much it can influence others. A powerful story about love and standing up to those who mean most to you, it also teaches you that it truly is what's on the inside that counts."
2,Like reading a short story...,"I'm a big fan of fairy tale retellings, and that's what I thought I was getting when I picked up this slim book. Instead, I got a story that seems to take about 3/4ths of the book to set up, and then wraps up so quickly you wonder if pages have fallen out of your copy. Ana is the daughter of a vain, beautiful mother, who only seems to love Ana if she is not a threat to her beauty. To gain her mother's love, Ana gains weight, doesn't wash her hair, and picks up other icky habits. Then Ana's best friend gets an invitation to attend a private girl's boarding school and before she knows it, Ana is send away to join her. Add in a little strange man that follows her mother everywhere and we're about halfway through the book. The story continues to feel like set up to a major plot twist, but the rest of the book just sort of...happens...and it's over. Not recommended."
3,Well written for the most part,"First off, I'd like to say that the idea behind this book is original, which adds a lot to the story. However, there were a few aspects of the book that really bothered me.1. The author refers to scientific discoveries, (for example, genetics), that wouldn't have taken place in the time period the book is set in. Also, the characters use some words which wouldn't have been used at the time, such as ""Yay!"", or ""crazy"" to describe someone.2. The plot speeds up towards the end, which makes the book seem confusing and unprofessional. The author could have added more detail or more events over the course of the book to make the story more involved.3. The twist at the end, (the one involving the father's death), seems out-of-the-blue and isn't properly explained.4. The story lacks subplots, which could have added so much to the book.Overall, Beauty had excellent characters and a good storyline; it just needed a little more added to it."
3,Another Retelling of Snow White.,"It looked like another Snow White version to me and well it was. I thought I would give it a try it looked pretty good but there wasn't ENOUGH substance in the book they just went quickly from one thing to the next, the characters were rushed and the death of Queen Veda? What the heck happened she just died because she saw her husband, and because the Beauty Consultant killed her or something?? Or did she just happen to melt to death like the wicked witch of the west because she found out she wasn't the most beautiful?? It overall was just OK it didn't blow my mind or anything it's like a shorter and rushed version of Snow White without the prince charming."
3,Too short,"Beauty is a story reminiscent of Snow White, about a young girl who takes pains to make herself ugly in order to please her mother. But throughout the book until the end, she remains in denial about her mother's attitude, which I find unbelievable. She was completely unaware of things until several chapters after the reader. Also, the story moved way too quickly. There was only the one solid problem in the whole adventure. No side trips or anything. It was a nice way to spend some time reading, but certainly not the best."
2,Avoid it.,"Carrying three stars on Amazon.com, Beauty by Nancy Butcher, deserves that score. I enjoyed the beginning of this book immensely; Queen Veda is obsessed with her own beauty and will not accept anyone else over passing her. Her daughter knows this, so Ana disguises her own beauty and attempts to make herself as ugly as possible to win her mother's love. But then she is sent away to an Academy blah blah blah...Yeah, as soon as that part of the plot came in, the book unraveled quickly. Many of the reviews say that it is too short and rushed; this is a perfect description.Avoid it, unless you are looking for something to read for an afternoon and have Nothing Better To Do."
2,Shallow,"This novel never took off. It had an original beginning, but the lack of character development of Ana left the reader frustrated and bored. The end came quickly and without the any character development, it was unbelievable that Ana could overcome her mother's anger, save the kingdom and her friends and live happily ever after. This is not a young adult fairy tale I will recommend to my seventh graders."
4,Good CD to run to.,"Like the first CD, but the mixing is much better quality. I don't remember having to adjust step to keep up with the rhythm. The cadences are not as good on this, but if you don't mind the lack of creativity and rhyming ability of a few of the drill sergeants, go for it. Overall, another great CD to run with."
4,Worth the Money,"If you enjoy running to cadence, this is a good buy, They are easy to understand and help get you pumped up for a good run. The cadences don't flow from one to the next as smoothly as I would like but still rythmic. A good buy."
3,A little bit different,"I agree with the other reviews. Adrian Legg is a real artist, and one who really deserves to be called artist. On this cd he mixes in some american influences, where Eric Johnson helped him, adds a poem, and kind of surprise song. While perhaps not the best place to start with Adrian Legg, a very enjoyable listen. And for me a very welcome variation of his other cds. Again 3 strong stars, which in my rating system means VERY good."
1,"the ""s""s drag too much! ""-SSSSSSSSSsssssss"".","I have yet to hear a version of Carmina Burana done by a German or English speaking chorus that does not over pronounce and incorrectly add ""s""s to the end of verse! (No offense.) It ought to be a short ""s"" or not pronounced at all. It bugs me like crazy listening to this version, because the ""s""s are dragged on and on! Suggestion, get a version done by an Italian speaking chorus."
4,GREAT CD! Rockers to Ballads....Recommend HIGHLY!,"I LOVE THIS CD! ""Better Than Ever"" is such a catchy tune. I find myself singing it all day long. ""Seen the Way"" is a true ""Faure"" ballad, sung from the heart...It's a beauty! ""This Is Love, This Is Real"" ROCKS! Looking forward, (with anticipation) to MORE from this AMAZING man!"
4,Fantastic Power Pop!,"Badfinger, Beatles and Elton John fans will enjoy every second of this CD. The single, ""Better Than Ever"" is upbeat and punchy and would sound great in a movie or TV show (Think Friends). Other choice tunes include the ballad ""Seen The Way You Look At Me"" and the harmony heavy ""Way That I Like It"". Pure pop for now people!"
5,A hilarious spoof perfect for any collection,"Richard Moore's spoof of horror cliches continues with BONEYARD V. 3, a fine full-color graphic novel packed with fine dialogue telling of one Michael Paris, who may have subdued the devil himself but now is beset upon by the IRS. The solution beyond selling the yard full of strange creatures: a swimsuit calendar - featuring the monsters themselves. It's a hilarious spoof perfect for any collection strong in graphic novels and comedy.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
3,Darrell Scott - Family Tree,"There are a few nice tunes here, but the album fails to capture the energy of his live shows. While insight into the artist can be interesting , in this case some of these tales should have been kept between him & his therapist"
3,Not a rating -- further information on this title and author,"Arnold Gillette was director of the University Theatre in Iowa City for many years; he received a United States Institute for Theatre Technology lifetime achievement award in 1972. This title went through 3 editions. Gillette also wrote ""Introduction to scenic design"" (1967); his son, Michael, wrote ""Theatrical Design and Production"" (1999)."
4,INTERESANTE Y DIVERTIDO,"Es un libro que muestra las diferentes formas de pensar, la diferencia de cultura, y la trasmision y adaptacion de costumbres al estar en un lugar diferente al usual, en una situcion bastante inusual....."
5,One of the best Morricone collections EVER!,"Any fan of the trademark Morricone sound of the early-mid 70's will love this collection. There are several versions of many of the main themes, with a limit on background action/suspense music. All-in-all, just about the best Morricone anthology I have heard. I am thrilled to be able to own this tunefest! I had been requesting ""The Burglars"" [""Le Casse,"" included here] soundtrack for quite a few years, so this is a kind of dream-come-true. However, a few of the Mantovani-esque selections that were featured on the Bell label vinyl release from the early 70's were omitted, while the Astrud Gilberto songs were added [these were NOT featured on the Bell release, and I did not miss them]. This was a minor disappointment in this overall spectacular collection, with the music from ""Le Professionel"" and ""Le Marginal"" also featuring some of the Maestro's most inventive and beautiful compositions.ESSENTIAL MORRICONE, in my opinion."
5,Black Daschund,"This was supposed to be for my little dog also, but my daughter loved it so much that I had to give it to her."
4,not bad,The front legs are a little too stubby so it's not as flexible as I expected. But overall it's adorable :)
5,great,"I had a dachshund that looked exactly like this. He died a few years back while I was at school and I never got to say goodbye. My boyfriend got this for me for our four year anniversary because he knows how much I miss him. It is very soft and really does look like a dachshund (though my dog had a longer nose).... The only thing I do not like is that the ears are threaded down so they can't ""flap""."
4,Life like dachshund,"This Douglas Cuddle Toy dachshund looks real. It has beautiful shiny, silky fur and it is made of high quality. I had a dachshund for 14 years and miss her, so I bought this product for myself. It is sitting on my couch and it is so life like I half expect it to jump off of the couch. I would recommend this product, especially for people who like the little dachy dogs. You won't be disappointed."
2,THIS JUST DIDN'T DO MUCH FOR ME,"The first story, Frankenstein, is the best of the three, as the storyteller gives graphic descriptions and creates an intense atmosphere. The storyteller has the same voice as the crater faced villager from House of Dracula. The second story, Dracula seems to go nowhere with very little imagination to keep your interest. The Wolfman is the worst of the bunch. It's told by a woman, who by my standards, isn't very good at voice acting. Then of course there are the sound effects at the end. Not very scary. Have heard better elsewhere. I recommend Famous Monsters Speak over this."
2,It's not the whole book!!!!!!!!,"This is the J.A. Giles translation, written in the nineteenth century, but it isn't the whole text! It includes the history, but not the part addressed to the five tyrants!"
1,Buy something else,"If you really MUST have the tracks on this CD & you don't care who the artists are, then buy it. If you want these tracks by the original artists, look somewhere else. At least it's cheap. No wonder the artists aren't listed. No one wants to take the blame for recording this crap."
2,Large error in readings,"This product consistently read my diastolic reading approximately 30 mm too low, although it was very consistent, always giving about the same reading. I took it to my Dr's office and checked it against their readings. The systolic was about right, but the diastolic was 30 low. Several readings were taken to confirm this. I have carefully read the instructions for cuff placement and could find nothing wrong with the way I was using the product.I gave this 2 rather than 1 stars since it was consistently giving the same reading. Maybe this particular unit was bad and others might do better. I think I'm going to give up an digital measurement and go with a completely manual product where you use a stethoscope."
2,Product Not As Specified,"Product that was sent was Ecoline not Samsung. I would have appreciated being notified if the original product purchased Samsung was no longer available to have had the option to receive a refund or to be asked first before sending a substitute. I know Samsung makes good product, I don't know the manufacturer Ecoline. Was disappointed so I haven't even tried them to find out if they work well."
4,A fun series continues.,"I have really enjoyed this series, and feel it keeps getting better all the time, although I can't honestly say that I enjoyed this book as much as the others. My biggest complaint was that the duel took overly long, and that Hallistra would have never trusted Danifae in any way. I felt the other characters were true to their personalities. What I enjoy most about this series is its serious tone and dark characters. I have always thought that Salvatore's drow books were kind of silly, and I find the Spider Queen books much truer to the nature of drow. Thank you for having no silly Bouldershoulder type characters!"
3,Just passing thru,"Not really the best book in the series, but at the same time when you are working on a series setup by one of the best fantasy writers in the Wizards arsenal it isn't all bad. If this book serves nothing else than to be a somewhat half hearted attempt to get the story write between two other great books, and it is only 1 bad book of six it will be alright. Have fun reading this series, the dark elves are one of the most dynamic races in fantasy at this time."
1,"Bad Book, Great Series","It seems as though the author didn't read the other books. Characters' physical descriptions are inconsistent with the other books. Kaanyr Vhok was red, now he's blue. Jeggred was immune to fire, and now his fur gets burned. The dialogue is overly simplistic and is awkward to read. Almost all of the spoken dialogue is broken up: ""Hey,"" said Valas, ""don't go in there."" instead of ""Don't go in there,"" warned Valas. The overly simplistic dialogue dilutes the characters' personalities as well, so they all come off as bland.The climactic events in the story seem very anti-climactic because they are interrupted by extremely minor events and the effect these climactic events has on the party and the rest of the world is never fully explained. Also, some of the tactics in the battles make little sense. It's almost as if the characters forgot how to fight. Skim this one and pray that the final book isn't this bad. Mel Odom is writing it, so I have high hopes."
1,Basura!,"Definitely the worst of the series. Can't believe what Athans did to all characters: none was the same as in previous books.I finished this book beacuse my sadistic mind kept telling me this was just a bad dream of Jeggred who finally awakes at the end! (Yes, that would have been a better plot!)And I agree with many others: (spoiler coming.....) Ryld's death is pointless, stupid, inconsequential, ilogical and, worst of all, boring.The worst is you can't skip it and go directly to book 6.PD. I'll never buy another book by Athans."
2,Derailed the entire series,Up to this point I was excited about the series. Than somehow Philip athans writes a book and does not lead off of ANYTHING the previous authors had done. It is like this is a standalone book. A bad standalone book. I read 1 book a week up until the end of this one than I just stopped. It took 6 months for me to become bored enough to finish the series. Athans left the next author Paul kemp almost nothing to use. It was like they were running a relay race and athans just threw the race and left kemp to try and finish. Very disappointing. This book is not a recommended read.
3,Decent...,"Well, I was a little disappointed with some parts, including everything including Ryld, not to mention the fact that over half of the 350 page book was dedicated to a single spell battle. However, it does progress the story in the direction it was intended to go, and as the the title of this review states, it was all-in-all decent. Worth reading if you are interested in the series."
2,worst book in the series,"I did not like the way the author altered the characters to his liking. To assume Quenthel would be weak and stupid just doesnt make sense. Someone of her power wouldn't waiver in her faith to Lolth.The plot was just plodding to me. The Dyrr/Gromph fight took way too long. The way Ryld dies is just weak to me. He's such a great character and you are gonna off him so easily?Phaurun did appear more powerful in this book which I enjoyed seeing. I hope he gets Jeggred in the final book, that creature is just annoying at this point.If you are a fan of the series then read the book, we can't change what has already been butchered."
1,Not worth your time and money,"The worst book in the series so far. In about three hundred pages, almost nothing happens: three battles, one eventless trip to the abyss, and that's it. The thin plot stretchs dully over all too many pages, the characters behaviour differs completly from their behaviour in the prior books (Distinctly, Quenthel), and there are lot of mistakes in the plot as well (for instance - the way Nimor appears out of nowhere after Gromph got rid of him in Extinction).My advice: read the summary and skip to the next book in the series. Hopefully It'd be better than this."
1,Wow....,"Like really, i mean its bad enough Athans messed up the baldur's gate's 1 and 2 novels (THe problem here i think was that he never played the game, I mean Minsc with long red hair..c'mon!) but now this book?...please stop butchering books, stop writting."
3,Read it to get ot the next one.,"I give this book three stars because it definitely lacks something that the first three had. There are several inconsistancies where events that occurred in the previous book were ignored. Remember a certain character was ""taken care of"" by another character in book IV but then with no mention of the incident the supposed-to-be-gone character is back in the story as if nothing happened. I also agree with the reviewer that wrote that the dialogue between the characters had definitely changed. Maybe it's just because the fourth books was so well done that this one seems weak but I think it's just a weak link in the series. Overall though it must be read. You must push through to the next book. After coming this far you cannot turn back."
1,Killed a good series,"Books one, two, and three were amazing. This book killed my interest in the series. The way the characters interact with other characters seems to have changed and aren't consistent with the other books. Some people claim it is the result of drow being chaotic but it is something more fundamental. It seems like the author didn't really know the characters he was writing about. The way Triel and some over the other priestesses interact with people is more tame and forgiving. It just didn't live up to who the drow are and certainly not the other 4 books."
3,Not as bad as all that!,"I should state for the record that I actually know the author. We played D&D together for years back near his hometown. Now that I've disclosed my bias, I will say that I liked this book. It's not Tolstoy or anything. Understand that books like this are outlined to death in committee with all the authors in the room. So possibly there was little to be done about the actual story arc. And I have to say that it's not my favorite series in the world either. But it was interesting to see the dark elves and their interaction with each other. Hopefully with the Forgotten Realms trilogy he's writting he will be given more creative licence."
2,garbage,WOW Pure garbage this is why I hate reading a sereies written by different authors there is always some idiot that didn't read the previous book and screws up the whole series. I guess I expected more with R.A. Salvatore's name on the front.
3,A drop in a great series,"One of the good things about Annihilation is that some questions are finally answered. As this is book 5, some of the mystery of the series begins to come together. Unfortunately the pacing of this book leaves much to be desired. The book ultimately consists of only a few events which are drawn out over a number of chapters and repeated ad noseaum. As another reviewer points out, the characters seem quite different than they did in the other novels, often for the worse. The book is still an enjoyable part of the series, it just doesn't seem to be up to the standard set by books 1-4. I don't fault the author, it is well written, I believe Mr. Athans was just not given that much material to work with and was limited to how far he could go."
4,Beautiful on the counter and works,"This is a pretty nice looking oil bottle. Simple, but the frosted words give it a bit of interesting look.Four stars out of five.. because there was a slight defect on the lip of the bottle. Not broken, but it isn't perfect. The glass is pretty nice, may come off thin and I worry that if I set it down a little too hard on the granite, maybe it may crack."
1,Awful pillow!,"The pillow is extremely hard. When you lay on it your neck sits up a good 4-6 inches so if you like really soft pillows, this is not the one for you! Also, whatever it is stuffed with is really noisy. Whenever you move your head, the pillow ""crackles."" I put my old one back on and I will stick to buying pillows in stores from now on."
4,okay,Initially the pillow was at a perfect firmness it has been a couple of months and it seems to be loosing its firmness. The ruffling noise it makes is not an issue I just wish it would keep its shape. Regardless of the price one pays for a good pillow they don't seem to last. Kind of sounds like life in a nutshell! Sadly as with life firmness and longivity are the first to go in time our mind will and then all will be perfect maybe that is when I will try to find the perfect pillow.
4,Christian Christmas Story,"I bought several copies of this book to distribute to the children in our church who participated in the Christmas pageant, the script of which was actually based on this book. It's a nice, Christian Christmas story."
3,Interesting insights from first-time adventurer,"My husband and I read this book. We felt that Bane had some interesting insights into the mental and psychological problems/solutions of ""adventurers"". However, this IS NOT the book one needs to find out the best way to enter into any of the 13 sports Bane tried. As wilderness skills instructors (rock climbing, caving, whitewater/flatwater canoeing, mountain biking), we realize that ""adventure"" sports really are about mitigating risk and still having a thrill. Not everyone can push the same envelopes Bane did and live to write about it. (We would have liked to have read in the book the amount of money Bane spent per sport.)"
2,demasiado virtuosismo y poca música,"admiro a cziffra como pianista, pero en esta ocasion he quedado un poco defraudado, sobretodo con el totentanz, creo que lo toca demasiado rapido, sin coherencia entre las partes, a veces de forma un poco caprichosa, con mucho brillo pero sin pasión, como si no acabara de comprender el sentido de la obra. parece un desfile de notas rápidas sin ton ni son, como si compitiera por ver quien toca más rapido.en contraposición, considero mucho más lograda la versión de Steve Mayer, más profunda, más trepidante, con mas sentimiento.como pack puede ser interesante, pero no como version de referencia, si quieres, para poder comparar con otros.en fin, es mi opinión.saludos,"
5,untitled,"If you still believe that Cziffra was just a virtuoso after listening to this CD, I can't blame you. But a great disc nonetheless."
5,Honeybee DVD,"This dvd was produced in Denmark to teach children about honeybees. Adults will also love this dvd. The narative explains what a hive is, the life of honeybees, and how bees pollinate flowers and trees.This dvd is not only education, but, it is fun to watch."
1,40 water? Naw kid 40 piss!!!!,"I felt like I was taking a piss on myself the whole time I listened to this album. What happened to the 40 water of the old days that used to rap with spice 1, 2pac, and mc breed? This clone of 40 raps with the likes of Lil jon (wack as hell), washed up 80 year old too short, and a bunch of losers I have never heard of. The album only gets props because eightball and mjg are on the album and ugk. And they almost played themselves by appearing on this god awful so called ""album"". E-40 has fallen into this commercial west coast version of crunk called ""hyphy"" in attempts to breathe life into his lifeless career. The album has some decent beats on it but there is no kind of lyrical content to be found anywhere. E-40 wouldn't know lyrical content if I slapped him with a Krs-One cd. This cd is wack simple and plain, Pee-40 is a beat waster, and he needs to find the nearest car wash and start drying off cars!!!"
2,Not E-40's best.,"The album is okay 40 seems to be merely picking up where everyone is in mainstream rap. Crack is talked about and publicized so much you would think it was one of the elements of hip hop. At this stage in 40s career I would like to have seen him up his level of conversation, exand his topic matter, and truly show why he has the style everyone tries to emulate. I am also not the biggest fan of lil' jon so I don't think that helped either with my rating. E-40s Ghetto Report Card is barely passing. Hopefully there is another semester for him to bring his grades up."
1,The Ballatician does NOT represent!,"DISAPPOINTING! Some of these reviewers just aren't knowin...definitely not knowin' Bay Area. He let us down by hooking up with Lil Jon, has lost the ""40 sound"" and sounds like a guest on someone else's album----throwing down good raps on messed up, unfocused, too busy beats that have none of the style 40 has been putting out all these years. Might he get some new fans that aren't familiar with his original sound? Yeah. BUT old fans will be disappointed.Big Al"
2,My Ghetto Report Card,"I'm a big fan of E-40 but I didn't like this release. I try my hardest to like the production, but being used to the sounds from his previous two records it's just way out of left field. Some of the songs are pretty bad too, but the album went Gold so people must like the new 40 Watta. I guess you are into the hyphy beats or not, and unfortunately I'm not. Overall there were a few good tracks but I'd say this is his worst effort yet. I don't exactly mean E-40 is bad, he does come with his usual good lyrics, it's just much different than the previous album and again different production. Hopefully he releases another album in a few years and uses a different production style. At least he had Bosko produce a few tracks."
1,worse than Southern Hip Hop,"This smells like grabage to me. I took this CD out from my local library. ""White Girl"" is a shameless rip-off of the classic NY Hip Hop gem ""Fly Girl"" by the Boogie Boys in 1985. All his ""slan'guage"" is just downright wack; no wonder he only sells in his home-town."
5,im not a kid..just dont want to register,aight...for all you idiots saying you want laid back beats..or that its too monotonous....that is HYHPYY!!! its all about goin dumb ass hell and lettin go. not chillin out. thats the way of old..come out to the bay and well let you know.this cd is clean as hell and def. somehing you can get stupid to for hours on end. a few songs are a little bit hard too.. the one with mikejones goes.buy this cd!!!!!!!also...get turf talk keak da sneak san quinn big rich and plenty more!!! they are all golden baby
4,E-40 is Back IN a Major WAY!!!!,"Had a chance to cop the album yesterday. I am a long time resident of the Yay area (Richomnd now live in Fairfield) and grew up listening to E-40 when he was just a young Mustache. This album is very well put together and his delivery just illustrates why he is a musical legend. At 38 years old, he can still flow with the best of them. This album should cement his legacy. The tracks that i enjoyed listening too are as follows.Yay Area ***** starsTell me when ***** starsMuscle Cars **** starsThey might be taping **** starsWhite Girl **** starsU and Dat ***** starsYee **** starsJust F ***** starsHappy to be here ***** stars.The rest are ok but as you can see there are at least 9 slamming tracks on this album."
4,I'm happy,"Well this wasn't E40's greatest album but I found It satisfactory. I was a big fan of his from the 90's and I had always hoped that he would come out with a new album. It's my belief that he is one of the great hip hop legends, that no one ever heard of. That is until this album came out. But I digress, the radio singles are good the rest of the album isn't anything to write home about. Over all though it's enough to keep me happily listening."
5,"Tight beats, lyrics, & collarborations","I'm way over here in Florida I listen to Bay music pretty much everyday, E-40 put his ""ooooh"" in this album...The lingo is original which these days is very rare. If ya have a system in ya ride ..this is the cd to use to test it !..You can ride, bounce or chill while playin this cd...E-40 ya did it again!! oooooh!!!"
2,Strike one,"Hmmmmm....I was not impressed by this release by E-fizzle. There are a few cuts on here, but the majority is not up to par. Maybe I'm just getting old but I liked the old E-40 waaaay better. This album seemed very commercial. But I can't hate on the dude. He has been on the grind for a loooooong time. He just now hit mainstream with this new deal with BMI. And congrats to the Big Homie. The bay needs somebody to hit the general public off with some of dat Hyphy muzik. Hopefully the next album will embrace the streets a lil more and have a more west coast feel to it."
3,Coffeechug Book Reviews,"This book is an old one published in 1988. I checked out several Tao books from the library and am slowly making my way through them in the limited time I have to actually read anymore. What I liked about this book is the fact that you could read a few contemplations at a time and that would be fulfilling enough for a couple days. The first part of the book has several little contemplations for you to read and think about. I took notes on several of them to use in my teaching and coaching of middle school. I find them very productive in terms of thinking in new ways and just taking pause to stop and consider all the things around us in life.This was a nice read for me. I got through it fairly easy and took away some pretty good ideas. I don't plan on purchasing this book like some other Tao books, but I am glad I read it."
2,I could do without this one.,"I don't know if the problem with this book lies in the original author or in Thomas Cleary's translation. At any rate, ""Awakening to the Tao"" reads like a tedious commentary on the Tao Te Ching that says far less in many more words. There are occasional insights that are worth reading, but they could have been condensed into about 5 pages; I would have happily done without the other 100."
2,Don't bother!,"I read this after reading their other title, ""Wolves in Chic Clothing."" Although WICC was not amazing, it was certainly easier to handle than this one. I generally read a book in one day, maybe two. It took me a week to struggle through this mess. You expect a book about ""upper"" society to be pretentious but this bordered on ridiculous and obnoxious. I will not be reading the authors again.Want to read something fun, witty, enjoyable, and actually hard to put down? Then try the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich, anything by Whitney Gaskell or Emily Giffin."
2,No,"I did not manage to get through this book. After page 122, I gave up.The premise of the book was very interesting, but the writing...the writing!!!! was horrible. I felt as though young children had composed the text.Some of the sentences sounded so silly! and not in a funny way.This one DOES NOT hit the mark at all."
2,Simply awful,"I was surprised to discover that the authors of this book actually grew up in the privileged world they write about. The novel was so filled with wooden stereotypes of socialites that it could have been written by anyone. In fact, all of the characters are stereotypes -- the stiff, British butler, the hot-blooded Hispanic mistress, ad nauseum. If you're looking for witty writing (save for a few unusually snappy lines, the writing is below average at best), interesting characters, or an absorbing plot, look elsewhere. I struggled to make it to page 100 before casting this book aside."
2,The dangers of editing by spell check...,"If this book were about anything other than Park Avenue Princesses, I might let it slide. But, to gush over their ""brilliant"" editor and claim an ""elite boarding school"" background when errors such as ""MASON du Chocolat"" and ""petits FOUR"" show up in your book is, as characters Joan and Wendy would snark, ""tacky, Tacky, TACKY!!""Typos aside, the writing is as wooden as one of Artie ""The Coffin King"" Korn's top o' the line teakwood specials.Save your money and read Michael Gross' 740 Park instead."
2,Not Their Best Book,"It's a tired cliche about a lower-class woman from Florida being shunned because she wasn't of right background, upper-class adultery, one of them involving a Mexican housekeeper turned mistress of a very prominent man whose life with his proper wife has been of boredom, yadda, yadda. A ""gay"" man gets murdered in the ""wrong part"" of town.This book has loads of cliches of the upper class. It wasn't well-written. I recommend Plum's book, Bergdorf Blondes or The Nanny Diaries. At least those books aren't boring."
2,"Read, skip, read, skip","I have to admit, I did not know exactly what to expect with this book, and I was a bit disappointed. Parts were funny and watching how some characters, especially Melanie developed and how Joan and Wendy were humiliated was amusing, but overall it was a very hot/cold book. The ""inner-workings of the Manhattan set"" was interesting, especially ""accepting"" an outsider, but overall, I skipped chapters and read ahead because it was a bit slow and wordy in parts."
1,Very offensive,"Trash all the way. The writers not only insult their characters but also readers who may find themselves and their style/taste looked down upon in the most offensive way. Any book that insults and alienates it's readers in such way deserves one star, but the book also comes short in plot, character development and dialog. Don't waste your money and time, if you must read chick-lit, you'll do much better with your money if you buy the B. Jones' Diary or the shopoholic series."
2,Not even a beach book,"I would have given the ""Nanny Diaries"" 4 stars, and the ""Devil Wears Prada"" 3, with the understanding that we are not expecting literature from these books. This one was so formula based I could have told you the whole story after a few chapters. I thought it would at least provide a window to a different world, but it did not even accomplish that. My suggestion, don't bother."
1,A new low for publishing,"How could this utter twaddle make it into print? Reading it was a complete waste of my time and money. It's sufficiently bad for me to write this, my first review. Heed the warning."
2,boring & whiny,"I didn't see a plot or a point to this book. It's incessant whining about rich people's 'lives' as the Social Elite of Manhattan. Plus, it has lines in it like 'She burgled his breath right out of his lungs.' The authors try way too hard for catty and end up sounding jealous. It was a total waste of time to read."
1,Save Your Money!!!,"The only reason that I continued to read this book past page 50 is because it was book club required reading! It is a book where you route for no one. Although I have no connection to the Upper, Upper, Upper East Side world where the book takes place, I find it unlikely that the diaglogue is accurate.This book does not even qualify as a good beach read. Purchase this book at your own risk!"
1,A VERY DISAPPOINTING READ,"I was hoping that this would be a fun book to read, like several of the other books of this genre (e.g, Bergdorf Blondes, Can You Keep a Secret, Trading Up, etc.). Unfortunately, this book was very disappointing and the intended satire was lost on me.This book is definitely worth missing, but if you choose to read it anyway and find it disappointing, don't forget that I told you so."
1,NO NEED TO PURCHASE THIS BOOK,"Boring, very sad description of Manhattan's socialites. I guess the writers had to have ""friends in high places"" to have this horrible and poorly written book published. Save your money and buy something else."
1,The Right Address,"I read about 50 books a year and this is the worst I have read in a long time. I am familiar with the 10021 neighborhood of NYC and I have never met ""mean girls"" like these. The editing also fails to check out the details. For example, on page 79 Arthur orders coffee. When the waitress brings the order, she spills the COKE on his pants. Trivial I know, but careless. I do not have a problem with reading trash from time to time, but this is too trashy even for me."
2,Bof...,"Didn't like it at all. Well written, undoubtedly, but the story is flat and boring. Had a really hard time finishing the book !!!Not worth the price I paid for it !"
2,"Same old story, no interesting twist!","The good news is that I paid only 50 cents for this book in hardback at a thrift store. The bad news is that I would have been really upset and disappointed if I had paid $12 for a paperback! I finished it only because I started it, and it was fairly short. Unfortunately, there is absolutely nothing notable about this book."
3,Entertaining but,"I read this book and found it to be entertaining initially and then midways through it I thought the authors really did the women a disservice. Why not right a book about types like Hilary Clinton, Elizabeth Dole and Barbara Bush? Now these women are powerful and actually help their powerful husbands ascend to their positions. I personally would love to read a story like that. Does anyone know of books like that? If so please email me the titles at kldavis1210@sbcglobal.net"
2,OK ChickLit,"I was initially surprised it took two people to write this book. There were some amusing parts, but the characters were kind of dull, except for the Puerto Rican girl--of course, she wasn't even part of that society--a good twist. Nice easy read."
4,Rare insight into the world of society and social climbing,"Contrary to Publisher's Weekly's review, this debut novel is anything but dull. BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES meets Brett Easton Ellis-style story may disappoint those looking for a mindless, torrid satire of high society. But for those who are interested in self-reflection, Karasyov and Kargman's vivid characters draw you in to the complexities of the New York (or any other city's) society scene. The book holds more laughs if you're more familiar with high society or the NYC scene, but it's a highly engaging and intelligently written work that truly deals with the complexities of human nature and what drives people to want to be accepted, no matter the world they live in. I found it hard to put down, but this was because of the multi-layered characters rather than NANNY DIARIES laugh-out-loud absurdities."
1,The literary equivalent of Showgirls,"Unlike Showgirls however it's not even fun to make fun of, it's just one long, painful insult to your intelligence.It's true that you can't judge a book by its cover because quite frankly the cover is the only good thing about this book.How this piece of drivel ever got into print is beyond me. It sounds like it was written by two mentally challenged teenagers who have been living on a steady diet of soap operas. I did my best to atone for the sin of buying this piece of trash by burying it deep inside the garbage can so that I wouldn't subject anyone else to it."
3,Dreary,"I gave it three stars because it was a quick read that kept me preoccupied for a short amount of time. I find the story to be lacking in depth and perhaps that is meant to be symbolic of the lack of depth demonstrated by the characters. Overall I would recommend this book to those who like light books about the rich, New York set. If you are looking for a thought-provoking tome you should look elsewhere."
2,An ok read...if you aren't really in the mood to think,"""The Right Address"" is often times a plodding, cliched read with more name dropping and brand dropping than a Dominick Dunne Vanity Fair article. If this is what ""society"" in New York is like, than remind me to stay away, though I am sure the authors intended us to have all our ideas of ""rich folk"" confirmed in one fell swoop. However, with that said, it is a quick read that will neither titillate you nor truly bore you. If you're stuck in an airport, or looking for a harmless read (albeit one with a lot of typos), then this one is not so bad.It is all about social climbers, typical unhappy-though-richer-than-God women, and old transparent gossips. If you are a reader like me, that likes to supplement your reading of book club books, classics, and prize winners with fluff, then you will surely not be disappointed. Like the Devil Wears Prada, Bergdorf Blondes, etc, this book is utterly forgettable fun."
1,Don't waste your time,"Unlikeable protagonist, poorly drawn and cliched supporting characters and a plot thinner than tissue paper. It all adds up to irritation that I spent time and money on this drivel. I'm all for a book that dissects the upper tiers of society, in this case New York's. And maybe these people are as banal, uninteresting and hackneyed as the authors portray them. But I can't believe that the Pygmalion story couldn't have been told with more wit and sparkle -- and a lot less predictability. If you want name dropping and brand mentions, buy Vogue. At least it has photos."
2,Meow,"Though it certainly had its witty moments and no doubt much is gleaned from real life, the characters were too viscious, too Stepford too petty too much of the time. Especially for people who supposedly went to the best schools and are ""cuhl-chad.""I cheered when the nastiest of the bunch had their come-uppance. Could have done without the entire Maria storyline - and her only-in-Hollywood denouement - altogether. Such ugly stereotyping of Latinas!!!! Be ashamed!And speaking of stereotypes, is anyone else weary of this genre's hatred of Florida and sterotypical Floridian characters (bleached hair, coarse manners, from a trailer park). YAWN. Lived in both NY and FL and can tell you with certainty that people named Sartomsky don't live in Tallahassee trailer parks. They live in Miami."
5,I'm shocked this got any negative reviews!,"I have read all of Jill Kargmans books and this one is by far the best. The fact that she is from a ""well to do"" family makes it even more interesting since there seems to be a bit of truth or experience in the tale. Her father is the former CEO of Chanel and her mother is a prominent socialite in New York. Very fun read that I couldn't put down."
3,"Worth the read, but don't expect great literature in this one.","This one was pretty good. It was a little hard to get into at first. I am glad I stuck it out though. If you like this one, also try The Nanny Diaries and The Devil Wears Prada."
1,Trash at it's worst,"Althought I finished it after Labor Day,this was bought as light beach reading but really doesn't qualify as that. Nothing redeeming about it. Who did these two gals know in order to get this garbage published. I've read much better prose on salon.com. It's back to school weather and so is my reading list...shame on me."
1,Glad I didn't pay for this book,This book was left in the faculty workroom anonymously for anyone who would take it. After reading only a few pages I could see why. I finished it simply because I hoped it would improve. Not so. Just idle gossip in the most pathetic manner. Anyone with an IQ over 70 will find this to be a juvenile and ridiculous attempt at wittiness. Don't waste your time!
3,Wonderful plot went to waste without humor,"The plot was interesting with plenty of twists and turns but it was useless without clear humor presented in the dialogue or insight. Unlike other chick lit/Park Avenue lit, there were no exaggerations (except to portray the wealth people have), no sarcastic views of things, no, well, no nothing. Honestly, it was sad to see such a good plot go to waste when clearly there were instances where the reader could have laughed out loud if the authors put a bit of work on it."
2,Meh,"It just wasn't that good. I finished it just to be done. There were tooooo many characters, so none really ended up with any depth."
3,For the Neiman Marcus set,"This much-anticipated book takes a bow to the Neiman Marcus set. The mommies who drive SUVs will read it for every morsel of learning. Some will read it as a real inside view of the rich lifestyle. Still others will view it for the People magazine-ish tantalizer that it is. This book doesn't begin to achieve what was done in The Nanny Diaries or I Don't Know How She Does It. Buy it used, borrow it from a friend, or check it out from the library. Not worth buying new."
3,"Fun, quick read - not to be taken so seriously!!","I enjoyed this book and read it quickly. As stated in other reviews, it is poorly edited with several obvious typos. I don't feel it was poorly written, though. The authors managed to keep the flow going throughout the book with many characters, whereas another author might have confused the reader.Unfortunately, many of the stereotypes described in this book do exist, and I'm more familiar with the upper crust of the Midwest! I do feel the authors know their topic, contrary to a publisher's review. The heroine was pathetic for much of the book and I found myself suggesting behavior changes that she ultimately made. In that regard, the plot became somewhat predictable. The ultimate outcome of all the characters seemed a little too tidy, but that kind of ending is what many readers want."
1,Really weak,"I like fun books instead of depressed ""literary novels"" that Oprah always has. But this was boring and badly written. I didn't finish it."
1,Absolute Trash,"Having grown up in 741 Park I've got to say that this book is absolute drivel and isn't worth the paper its printed on. While there are, as in any city, rich trash who abuse their money, this book completely stereotypes New York City society to such a degree that its sickening to read.These two class obsessed ""authors"" (if you can even call them that) have quite possibly created the snobbiest piece of literature in the English language.Bottom line is that this book is rubbish."
1,a waste of time and money.,"Not only was this book an insult to my intelligence, it was full of the most awful stereotyping. The Mexican character Maria is a caricature of a human, something that's not done to any of the other characters in the novel.Some of my favorite moments come when Melanie refers to Asia as ""that backward continent with weird picture letters,"" and when one boy tells another boy that the only reason people think women like Penelope Cruz and Selma Hayek are hot is because ""it's p.c.""The authors must have hired a P.R. firm to salvage their star rating because there is no way this tripe is worthy of three stars.Don't waste your money on this drivel. Seriously."
1,Definitely One Star!!!,I was extremely disappointed with this book. It was not what I expected and I was bored 95% of the time.
4,Another underrated R&B group,"Along with Shai and Portrait, Riff was another underrated four part harmony group of the early nineties. There most remebered for the songs Everytime My Heart Beats, My Heart Is Failing Me and White Men Can't Jump. The group displays a lot of vocal talent on their covers of Voyage To Atlantis and There'll Never Be and the uptempo track Judy Had A Boyfriend."
2,Not as good as the original,"I had low expectations when I streamed this, but it was worse than I expected. It's not often I say this, but it was poorly shot. Numerous scenes are backlit. Not in a good arty way, but in a bad lighting, bad cinematography way. The score was pretty terrible as well. As a guy, the biggest reason to watch this is the Vandervoot eye candy and even that was somewhat disappointing. The plot was ok, but it just didn't have the intrigue of the original. My advice: Rewatch the first one instead of watching this."
3,Glub glub glub........................,"The story drifts along lazily going nowhere, then POW, it wakes up, and we have death, mayhem, and not a little action. The problem is, this doesn't happen until the final fourth of the film and by then it's a bit late in the game to try tossing in a plot. Unfortunately, that plot is a bit too familiar, something seem almost weekly on any TV show you'd care to mention.It works as a diversion but nothing you'd care to keep for future viewings. At least I'm not keeping it."
2,Into the Blue 2: The Reef,"Not bad acting by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort as two scuba diving adventurers. This movie had all the potential to be a great scuba diving adventure film but the writing fizzles out at the end leaving you shaking your head. Maybe ""Into the Blue 3"" will be better.John Marcone"
1,worst movie i have ever seen,this is the worst movie i have ever seen. i hate producers who put nudity in the movie for nothing. makes want to do some negative things to them. if i want to watch a porn im gonna watch a porn. anyway that movie was wack
4,Good value. 3 of 4 mats a perfect fit,"I purchased this set for a 2005 Scion TC. Driver and passenger fit perfect, rear right fit perfect, rear left did not (the right and left rear floors are not the same shape, the stock mats accomodate for this). It's a good value for the money, not as rugged as the stock mats but definitely an adequate replacement considering stock mats cost 3X the price. The black is very dark, darker than the black of the floor itself. The mats are plusher than the stock and look real clean. I'm pretty happy with this purchase."
5,Fun and enjoyable!,"Bought a bunch of different packages of Heroscape. My 11 year old son enjoyed playing it. Alot to this game, lot of math and reading. Didn't take him long to catch on. Had a ball even losing to him. Great game."
5,I've found my new brand of anti-perspirant/deodorant. I ...,"I've found my new brand of anti-perspirant/deodorant. I love this stuff. I used to switch from brand to brand because I never found one I really liked. Old Spice has created a great formula that actually works as an anti-perspirant and smells great. I'd highly recommend this to friends and family; in fact, I already have. I'll continue to buy this product for a long time."
4,This deodorant has a great scent and lasts ...,"This deodorant has a great scent and lasts all day long. The only thing I didn't care for was the fact that it's a cream. I'm not sure I like that. It's easy to use and if I've gotten used to it by the time I run out, I'll use it again. I'd recommend it to everyone who likes cream deodorant or is willing to try it."
4,Fun for the whole family,"Our whole family loves most of this CD and I'd really love to give it 5 stars.First the good stuff - the voices and instruments are fun to listen to, you have a variety of musical styles (polka, ballet, country, classic rock), and the lyrics are cute, funny, and catchy. My kids get some of the humor and can sing along to much of it.The first track, though, starts with a drum roll intro thing that is hard to hear unless you really crank your volume - then the rest is too loud. ""Worms"" is a lounge singer piece which is funny but is just too long for the kids. ""I dig pigs"" is a litle ""scary"" for some little kids. But it's easy to skip a track or two. Basically a great family album!"
5,Perfect,I read this book early in 2002. It was a pity that was published so early in the year as prize jurors completely ignored what was one of the top five books of 2002.I was enthralled by Coady's storytelling abilities. She wove a complex story about complex (sometimes hearbreaking sometimes hilarious) people and a year of their lives. She is a master of voice and tone. Saints of Big Harbour reads like it was written with the mastery of an older author but with the freshness of youth.Saints of Big Harbour is a perfect book.
3,"pretty good, but needs better navigation","This was pretty good, but lacks some pretty familiar terminology, difficult to navigate. We had a lot of trouble figuring out how to tell the Mexican guys taking care of our horses that a colt was being gelded, and figuring out how to tell them a horse is a gelding. Difficult to tell them that this horse needs his legs wrapped, that one needs turnout for 20 min, another one is colicky, don't feed him, and if anybody has navicular or founder, not able to easily convey it. Perhaps could make a differentiation in Mexican, Cuban, Spain, and South American countries, but I admit that is just ""picking"" and this is still a good book to have. Huge thick book, but again, needs to be easier to navigate, in my opinion. that said, it is well worth having."
5,much needed,"This book is essential if you are working with spanish speaking people around horses. It is organized along topic lines so if you are teaching a lesson, you can refer to the terms you will need by that section. If you are talking to your groom, there is a section on that. Or if you are the barn manager and need to communicate tasks, etc., there is a section on that too. And all equestrian disciplines are covered. This book is indispensible anytime you have a spanish-speaking horse person."
2,Argentina,"I bought this book primarily to take with me to Argentina where I play polo. While this book was still useful, there are lots of words and phrases that are just different down here. For instance, nobody calls a polo mallet a ""martillo de polo"" (polo hammer), everyone calls them tacos. Calling it that seems just as odd to Argentines as ""baseball mallet"" would seem to Americans. A polo ball is not so much a ""pelota de polo"" as a ""bocha."" To play ""stick and ball"" is to ""taquear"" (an important verb not in the book). The polo field is almost always called a ""cancha"" not a ""campo."" A match is ""un match,"" not usually ""un juego."" The word ""montar,"" while understood, is never used, using ""andar a caballo"" pretty much exclusively. Some of the equipment and some of the words are also different down here. This may seem nitpicky, but Argentina is the most important polo country in the world and horses are probably more important in Argentina than in any other Spanish-speaking country."
1,terrible,"I purchased this in December and made the mistake of not setting it up immediately. When I discovered the subwoofer was defective (in Feb), it went to the local JVC-approved service center and has been there for the last 4 months.Even for the mere $60 that I paid for it, I am not pleased."
4,good for the money,I have to admit if your looking for an inexpensive speaker system this one is it. It works well with a gaming rig or with one of those generic dvd player amp combo you find at Walmart or target. Works great for the price 5 stars!!
2,speakers suck...but subwoofer it good (5 stars for subwoofer + -3 speakers = 2 stars),the little speakers are horrible - broke when dropped and terrible sound. the only thing worth the money is the subwoofer....it still works and it great...but the other speakers suck!!!
2,JVC (junk very cheap),ok not a bad speaker system for $50...however if you didn't know JVC was always knownto us from back to the 70's as Junk Very Cheapyou get what you pay for here...
4,"Great price, sweet product","What can I say, I needed a subwoofer for my existing 5.1 system, and couldn't even get a decent subwoofer for this kind of money. I figured I was buying this to get the subwoofer (my system is fine without one, but I wanted that bassy boom). After getting this speaker system, the whole thing is going into my living room, These handle more power than the ones I had already, and the smaller size makes them better for my small living room. Awesome buy!!"
3,Good sounding speakers,"These babies sound great! Small and cheap, but very good sound. I'm using the woofer and one of the other speakers to replace crappier speakers on my home theater system. Excellent sound quality for the price."
4,Mighty Speakers,"Great small speakers and compact with clarity sound, subwoofer is excellent, great speaker for less cost."
4,Great speakers for the money,"At the time I bought these Amazon was selling them for only $50. I've never had a 5.1 setup before, and JVC being a brand name I found the deal too good to pass up (I got a used JVC 5.1 receiver for a good price on ebay to go with it). Anyway, you get good, crisp treble from the speakers and nice round bass from the powered sub. I had the sub turned up to the max and there was no distortion or muddy sound. The only downside is that sometimes the plastic on the satellite speakers will vibrate and this vibration is audible. It doesn't happen too often though, and never happens on ""busy"" music such as techno. The powered sub is rated at 100 watts, and the speakers at 110 watts (I don't know if this is per channel or for all of them together). Visibly, these look nice and the box includes long, color coded speaker cables and rca cables as well. If you're looking for good sound at a budget price I wouldn't hesitate to get these."
3,speakers,"The speakers are okay for the money, but the sound is not what I expected from a name like JVC."
2,Just Okay,"When I saw these speakers listed for $50 plus free shipping. I didn't expect much. I figured I could use them in my bedroom to get surround sound for my tv for cheap. They are pretty much worth what I paid. Nothing great, but they do the job. Sound is just okay. The subwoofer rattles a lot, even not at high volume levels."
3,Mellow Tea,"I was not a huge fan of the peony white tea. I happen to like the gentleness of white tea., but found myself not really enjoying the Peony taste."
5,I like the taste!,I researched this kind of tea and were happy to find out that it is great source of many kinds of antioxidants! This particular brand has great taste and is at the right price!
5,Prince of Peace puts only about half as much tea in each tea bag as Bigelow does,"The only defect I could find was that Prince of Peace brand puts only about half as much tea in each of its tea bags as other brands such as Bigelow brand. This shouldn't be a problem for people trying to brew just one pint of tea with one tea bag. However, if you have been happy brewing a half gallon of tea with just one Bigelow tea bag, then you may need to use two Prince of Peace tea bags per half gallon of boiling water to get the same quality of tea. One gram of white tea has more catechins and more polyphenols than one gram of green tea (please click ""Comment"" below). If green tea is stronger than oolong tea and white tea is stronger than green tea, then what would be stronger than white tea? Rooibos tea? No. Honeybush tea? No. Olive leaf tea? Yes! Live long and prosper."
1,Well this is not white tea,"I feel extremely cheated after trying this tea. I bought the Oolong tea and decided to give this white tea a try since it had so much good reviews. The tea tastes, smells and looks exactly like the oolong tea. White tea should have a clearer look to it but this was just a rip off after spending almost $8 on it. Next time I'll stick to the Lipton white tea cause I just feel so wronged. Oh well guess I learnt my lesson buying tea online."
3,Decent Brew,"Prince of Peace Peony White is better classified as a Shou Mei grade of tea. It forms a relatively dark brew in the cup, reminiscent of a green tea or perhaps an Oolong. Nevertheless, its taste is smooth and pleasing with little astringency. All in all, this a good deal on a decent cup of tea - but if you're looking for a true white tea, you should search elsewhere."
5,Great if you're looking for lower caffeine,"I'm a former coffee drinker who's moved to tea. I was finding that coffee was just getting me too tense. I drink a lot of Earl Grey. But I heard about white tea, I hadn't know about it before. It has lower caffeine than even green tea, and quite a bit less than an earl grey or black. It also is supposed to have a lot of antioxidants.I'm finding this tea to taste more like a black tea than a green. Green has a grassy taste to me. The thing I really like is I can continue having several cups without getting an overload of caffeine. If that's what you're looking for, I'd recommend it. The price is right, too!"
4,Terrific Organic White tea,"I had read about this tea, but had never tried it. I was unsure if I wanted to purchase something online, but wanted to try it. I found it to be very refreshing, and would consider buying it again."
4,Really good violent racer for psp,"This was one of my first games for the psp when i got it at christmas time around a month ago. I like this game because for being on a hand-held it has pretty good graphics and sound. I love how you can jump from car-to-car and if you have enough points you can jump in slow motion and shoot the drivers and passangers(you can do that anyway but its cooler in slo-mo). Its a pretty long game because ive played it for no less than 4 hours and it says im about 37% through the game.I got this game for christmas for around $19.00 brand new on ebay. I think for being brand new that, that is a very good price. I think its worth max. $20 but not really much more than that. So if your looking for a cheap shooter/racer pick this game up soon."
2,"Fun at first, but not enough to it","Gotta be short and sweet since I'm at work. While the gameplay in innovative and very much fun at first, once you get past the fact that you're slo-mo jumping from one car to another, and then trying to do the same with the next car in line, it just gets old quick. There is no aiming your weapon, or any other skill techniques for that matter. You press one button to automatically jump onto another car, you hold R trigger to lock on and fire. Sometimes it's cars, sometimes trucks, sometimes boats, but they all work basically the same. I wouldn't pay over $20 for it."
2,Launch pad for practicing,"This is a simple training aid that has an arched plastic base with 2 fold out rubber flaps. Alignment lines allow a user to set up parallel to the target line. A small port allows you to put in your own tees. The device folds easily and can fit into a large pocket in a standard golf bag.Hitting the driver with your own tees is good as any other mat. However, hitting hybrids or irons has a big drawback: The noise when you hit the ball and then the plastic base. It is distracting. It does simulate hitting turf with the flexibility of the arched plastic base. The base is relatively stable but can move with contact.This does take some abuse from contact and is durable except for the rubber flaps.There is a better alternative on the market:TrueStrike Domestic Portable MatVERDICT:Better products exist out there. Look elsewhere.One thumb down."
2,Definitely not as quiet as advertised!,Far from ultra silent. More like a 4 to 5 scone on the rating scale. And doesnt warm all that much even in my very small bathroom.
1,Heater too small,"This heater/fan is a great disappointment. I take my shower early in the morning. The heater is too small at about 2X4 inches. The fan is strong, the light is bright, but the heater fails the test. Our small bathroom has an electric baseboard heater, too. But during the winter, this Broan disappointed me. It hasn't kept me warm until lately when the night-time outside temperature has risen well above freezing . I am usually quite satisfied with Amazon products, but not this one."
3,Broken after 2 years,"For a product that costs over $250, I expected it to last much longer.Installation was expensive, too, since it must on a separate 20 amp circuit.Fan was pretty noisy, too, seemed much louder than 0.9 sones. Other than that, it worked well.Overall, a good product for 2 years but can't recommend with such a relatively short life span.Broan customer service is excellent however. They tell me a need a new heater element - $35- and say I can replace it myself and can even have one of their tech staff walk me through it. Hope that is true."
5,Nice bath fan,"Wanted a heat source in our small master bath, this unit worked out perfect. Quiet when fan is running, and gives off a good amount of heat. As other reviews have stated, the light is not super bright, but works fine with the other lights in our bathroom. Only issue we had was the fan shipped without a part, so we had to wait for the replacement part to arrive. Amazon and Broan were both very helpful in resolving that problem. Definitely would buy again. Love it!"
5,Love it but,The fan is very quiet and the steam accumulation in my bathroom seems much less. I love the heater but I wish the heat would disperse through out the whole room. Overall I would recommend this fan.
1,"Heater crapped out after only 2 years of use, terrible! PAID OVER $200","Heater crapped out after only 2 years of use, terrible! PAID OVER $200Heater worked well within the 2 years however I would not buy another or recommend."
4,Exactly As Advertised,"My bathroom is 12'x 14' with a 9'ceiling. It's a corner room, so has 2 outside walls and stays fairly cool in winter. I turn on the heater 15 min. ahead of time and it heats the room perfectly for a shower or bath. The fan/vent is almost soundless. I wish I could make the light brighter by adding another bulb or using a larger one - if the bath were smaller and ceiling lower it would probably light the area better. I'm very satisfied with Amazon's service and price and would buy again."
3,dissapointment,"my original broan heat,exhaust and light installed 30 years ago worked fine but was noisy.Two years ago we replaced it with the Broan Ultra Silent series and we are happy with thequietness and operation of the heater and fan except the heater element has blown out twice.The first time I exchanged the unit but this time I will have to buy an element and change it or replace the whole unit so I don't go through this ever year.Dissapointed compared to the original unit."
1,Don't waste time or money,"This series has been going downhill for awhile now, but this book just may be the end of the road for me.As the series has progressed, Judith has become irritating and unlikeable, but the supporting cast made the books tolerable. However, not even Renie and Gertrude could save this one.The ""surprise twist"" at the end was lame. But worse was the story itself, with Judith continuing to stick her nose into things that don't concern her and get people to yap her ear off just because ""she likes people."" It's been a lame premise for getting her involved in the mysteries through entire series, but it just came across as completely ridiculous this time.The dialogue is painful to read, the writing has become amateur. Ms. Daheim should put this series to bed and concentrate on the Alpine series, which is still enjoyable."
1,Felt Cheated,"I've read all of Mary Daheim's B&B mysteries, and until this one, generally enjoyed them for what they are, entertaining cozies that chart the lives of Judith Flynn and her family as Judith solves various murders. So I was all set to expect more of the same entertainment from this latest in the series. I don't want to spoil the plot, but suffice it to say I felt disappointed with the trick that the author played on this reader. By the end of the book, I also grew to dislike pretty much all the characters. The gambling casino location seemed to bring out the worst traits in most of Judith's family members. I agree with the reviewer who said this is not one of Daheim's better efforts. I hated this book so much that I revealed the surprise ending to the members of my monthly mystery book club so that none of them would be tempted to read the book and suffer the same irritation and disappointment that I experienced."
2,not her best work,I read all the Bed and Breakfast books and I generally LOVE them all - I don't really know what it was but I felt like I was just really getting tired of Judith sticking her nose into things the twist was nice and I cannot wait till the next book - but it was a major downfall to her last book and to all the previous titles in this series. I think maybe there just wasn't enough Rene in it for me -
1,Worst of the series,"I have ready every one of the B&B series and, without a doubt, this book is the worst and a waste of good reading time. The conclusion to the mystery was ludicrous and unbelievable. I've often found myself thinking, ""Judith, get a spine for heaven's sake"" as she is stepped on throughout the series. However, this book left me thinking that the character has no backbone and never will. When she should have been furious with the solution, she, once again, allowed her ""loved ones"" to belittle her. I'm just thankful I didn't pay for the hardback version of this travesty."
1,Was 84 year old Carl Sandburg in Love with Marilyn Monroe?,"I recently saw on the internet very nice photos of a partyin Hollywood in 1962 at Producers Henry Weinstein. Presentwere Carl Sandburg and Marilyn Monroe. According to therecollections of photographer Arnold Newman, it seemed to him that Carl Sandburg was in love with Marilyn Monroe. He was 84yrs old that year.I wonder if he ever wrote a poem for her.He did write two magazine articles.In Look Magazine Sept 11, 1962 issue he wrote a Tribute to Marilyn Monroe.In CAVALIER Magazine vol 1/63 there was an article CARL SANDBURGTALKS ABOUT MARILYN MONROE, interviewed by Julian Scheer.Carl Sandburg said of Marilyn Monroe:""She was not the usual movie idol. There was something democraticabout her. She was the type who would join in and wash up thesupper dishes even if you didn't ask her""I wonder which of his songs had her in mind. Anyone know?"
3,"nice design, works great, poor materials..","I like this model enough that I've put up with a bad gasket design. If there's any moisture in the bottom of the gauge when it freezes, the gasket will shift and cause the gauge to leak. I blame this mostly on the cheap clear plastic shell. Regardless, it's the best I've found for reading at distances and seems to be pretty accurate compared to another gauge I used to use. For the do-it-yourselfers, applying a bead of adhesive, all weather silicone to the gasket area will prolong it's life."
1,A Guide??,How is this a guide? I was expecting a step-by-step guide to do any of the promised! I feel cheated.
2,"Rhapsody in Bue: ONLY piano, not full orchestra","Just a warning:This Blu-Ray: Rhapsody in Blue: ONLY piano, not full orchestra. Sound is good but don't expect the big sound of the orchestral version of Rhapsody in Blue... Kind of dissapointing."
1,Piano only!!,"I thought this was a rich production with a full orchestra and 7.1 channel sound. Wrong ! It is a Piano Duet that is unaccompanied. I did not notice the posted review warning of this. This is a waste of money and time. Rhapsody in Blue deserves nothing less than a full orchestra and unless you have a yearning for listening to unaccompanied piano, pass on this"
1,Disappointing,"What a let-down. The performance is fine but to live up to the hype of 7.1 dts, a full orchestra is needed. This is like painting a rainbow in black & white."
5,An impactful and educational book,"This is a wonderful book, sharing the powerful experience and stories of Sharon Bray's ""scribbling women"", and a detailed description of the Amherst Writers & Artists method as a means to open doors and draw out beautiful words. I've been taking one of Sharon's writing classes over this past year and it has been a true gift to be able to engage in this creative process among women who have been through and understand the impact of living with breast cancer. Sharon is an amazing storyteller in her own right, and the chance to hear and learn from her has been very rewarding and thought-provoking. If you are directly involved with someone living with cancer, living with it yourself, or even if not, this book has something meaningful to tell you."
5,Fills in the Gaps,"I consider this the best biography of these four scientists going. It has the technical foundation that more popularized treatments lack but it has a great sense for the individual personality too. In particular, it has a through treatment of Freeman Dyson's work and background, something that gets slighted elsewhere. I think the insight into Feynman's personality is spot on and correctly assesses the forces that led him to behave as he did as well as achive what he achieved. Read it for the wonderful section on Dyson if nothing else but the whole book is great."
5,Nice and very detailed historic introduction,A very detailed description of the development of quantum electrodynamics. Would be better if it contains some more material about Tomonaga.
4,"Good book, but too many math typos at least in beginning","Important book, but first part of least has too many typos in the equations!I have realized that the virtual photons really play an important role in the quantization of the Maxwell field - not surprising.Specifically p.p.39-40-41the problem in the 1929 Heisenberg Pauli Feb & Sept papers ""On the quantum dynamics of wave fields"" that the conjugate momentum time like component vanished making a contradiction with the commutation rules. However, that was only for on-light-cone real photons, adding the off-light cone virtual photons where AI^,I =/= 0 solves the problem, no need for Heisenberg to take ""epsilon"" to zero on p.41.[...]Remember it's the virtual photons et-al that anti-gravitate as dark energy, and it's the virtual electron-positron pairs et-al that gravitate as dark matter."
1,Keep your money! Beware of seller!,"This pool cover is cheaply woven blue plastic strands that are just like the cheap blue tarps you can buy at a hardware store - definitely not good enough for a pool cover. We requested return authorization two weeks before the return window expired and Cal Splash denied the return, stating that their product description indicated that the product shipped may vary from the product shown. We never even removed the cover from the box after seeing the material it was constructed from. I have filed a complaint with the BBB regarding this. There is no reason in the world that they should not accept the return."
2,No more interesting than dozens of episodes in dozens of TV shows,"Nothing in this movie is especially plausible. Although the production values (cost) are high, there are hundreds of episodes, in dozens of science fiction TV shows that are far more worth watching.A soccer kid ... amazingly ... has complete access to what would be one of the most secret installations in the world. He decides to ""fix"" a mistake he made in a critical international match. That's cheating? Well, this movie isn't bothered by minor philosophical issues like that!Going back in time to the wrong place in the woods randomly, he is beset by bandits, who try to kill him. That at least is believable. However, he's saved in a nick of time by a beautiful girl who happens to be just his own age. What a coincidence! You can see where this is going. This movie is banal and obvious sci-fi tripe. Worth two stars because they spent a considerable amount on filming, and it's pretty."
1,It doesn't fit!,"poor manufacturing, bad listing, had to send it back,also their measurements are bad, it was skinner thespecified, no 646! I should have gotten EBC!"
4,Better than stock but noisy,"Put these on my 2012 Honda Fit whos brake pads are terrible from the factory (my 2008 Toyota FJ stops way better and its huge comparitively). Took maybe 10 minutes per wheel. They drop right in, no modifications needed that I could tell. They grab much better and I at least feel like they're performing much better. I didn't do any X-to-0 stop comparisons so I have to go by my gut.They're clean too - no more brake dust than the stock pads.My only issue is they rub noisily at very low speeds (like pulling out of a garage or parking space) - sounds like when you rub wet skin on a balloon. It's pretty minor and I wouldn't suggest not getting them for this minor flaw, just be aware it happens so it doesn't take you by surprise. I waited to write this review to see if it went away after a break in period, but I have at couple thousand miles on them now and they still do it."
4,Passionate musical display.,"This is my first experience with Lalo's Symphonie espagnole, so I do not have a basis for comparison, but being a violin music fan, I have heard a few violin concertos with different artists, from the virtuoso to the romantic, and this great recording fits somewhere in the middle. Anne-Sophie Mutter's tone is delicate but fierce, and precise but somehow fragile; her performance in these three showpieces is outstanding, sometimes it sounds like she is playing on the edge of losing control of the pieces, but she makes no mistake and resolves all the technical challenges in the music with ease. Maybe that is what makes this record worthwhile, it has an intense emotion which goes beyond the technical mastery to evolve into a brilliant musical experience. The only downside is the short duration of the record, but the music on it is excellent, and for a discount price, it is hard to get a better record for your money."
1,Duped,"I feel I have been duped by this Import CD of Against Perfection.Little did I realize that there were 2 less songs and that it did not include Sunshine Smile.Had I known this, I would not have bought it:("
4,Buy this for the 1st track,"I have owned this since it was released about 10 years ago - Adorable and their 1st single ""Sunshine Smile"" were absolutley what I wanted to hear back then. I thought they sounded like The Smiths, although most music critics compare them to Echo and the Bunnymen.My favorite tracks are ""Glorious"", ""I Know you too Well"" and of course the brilliant ""Sunshine Smile"" (which by the way was NOT available on the Import version I own - but was made available on this domestic release). Good for you - it's Adorable at their best.For those interested: Their 2nd album, ""Fake"" was quite a bomb in the press & they disbanded shortly thereafter. The lead singer formed a band Polak in the late 90's.If you like this band, check out Lush or Slowdive."
2,And that's being nice.,"This movie is despicable, punk rock? Where? Some of the skate scenes were kind of cool at best. There seemed to be a Romeo and Juliette kind of theme going on here but this movie is low budget at best.I would not reccomend this to anyone. Now I'm stuck with this sorry DVD I'll just donate. Waste of money!!!! No punk rock at all!"
3,BEWARE of shipping!,"Before we start I would like to say that I did not order this from anyone I know of selling this on amazon, I bought at my local petco. Well the good is that my hamster uses it regulary. The bad is when I got it there was a tear in the litter and it went all over the place! With that stated I think there might be a sharp part in the set or something happened to it the factory. I went through the only two peices of it and it didn't break any skin. I do not know for sure about what happened so please keep that in mind when you purchase it."
3,its so so,"I gave this a 3/5 because it came half unsteady. The lid for your hamster can go in and do his business, it was not placing in correctly I wasn't quite happy I had to fix it up with tape just to use it in my hami cage. Not only that but my hamster doesn't use it he puts litter in it & doesn't even use the litter at all. One good thing is he won't eat the litter so I rated it a 3/5."
2,Hamster Potty,I got this product because I thought it would help in having less of the mess.But it all depends on how the hamster sees it.
3,Its ok,I dont kno if its cuz i have a serian an this is kinda small so he likes to go in it an play but not really to potty
1,Super pet hamster potty,"From what I read is that you can train you hammies to use the potty. All I found was that they were either eating it or storing it in their mouth. I couldn't tell if they were actually eating it and that worried me. No where on the box did it say non toxic. So, I removed the hamster litter and placed some of their droppings in it and they actually would remove the droppings from it and didn't use it. It didn't work for me."
1,"Ok, but not the best","Ok, but not the best. Our hamsters do not use this, they dig in it to spread the pellets everywhere. This was a waste of money."
5,Pee Only,"Our hammie loves her pottie, and uses it exclusively to pee. She still poops all over the cage. Keeping the cage shavings dry is healthier for the animal. You can easily clean the potty every day, whereas cleaning the entire cage every day, or even every few days, can be impractical. She used it after about a day of is being there. She's had it for one year, and it's quite funny -- she gets up out of her igloo during her middle of the day's sleep, goes pee in her potty, takes a drink out of her bottle, and goes back to ""bed"" in her igloo.We use a pellitized wood shaving product for the potty. It's sold at the pet store, and is just different enough from the shavings that she treats it as what it is. I've never seen her put it in her mouth."
1,Nice idea,I thought this would be a good idea for my hamster but he didn't use it. I put droppings in it and even some bedding with pee but he didn't get the idea. Also it was too small for him. (He's a syrian).
3,Not into Raspberry's but.........,"Revival Soy is the best out there!! I have tried all of it!! Love the peanut butter chocolate pal best. The shakes are great and so versatile, you can literally add your own fruit too.I love the strawberry fructose shake and I add banana's for added zing. It has helped me to lose weight, maintain weight, increase energy level, and bunches of other good stuff. Better then slim fast and you can't add fruit to slim fast.So Nasty, try some of the other flavors or stick to slim fast or fast food. :)"
1,Nasty,"No actual pieces of raspberry; just pink crispy balls, looks like styrofoam. Chocolate doesn't taste real, more like carob. And it's fairly large, which sounds like a positive thing, until you realize how much you have to choke down! Revival Soy does actually have some other slightly better tasting products, but none I'd like to subsist on!"
3,"A light, entertaining read","This is a short, light mystery set in the theatre world of the Regency era. Kate is an actress who prefers playing ""breeches"" roles to that of the tragic heroines. However, when the actress who plays Desdemona in Othello is murdered, and the actress who replaces her is arrested for the crime, Kate either has to find the killer or take the part herself. The novel is strong on characterization (Kate has a marvelous voice), but a little more detail regarding time and place would have greatly enhanced this book. Also, readers looking for romance may be disappointed, as Kate and her ""friend"" Archie do no more than exchange kisses in a rather unbelievably chaste relationship."
2,Well made but noisy,"This shock mount is nicely made with quality parts, very sturdy indeed. Unfortunately the shock mount makes noise when wiggled side-to-side which is heard in the microphone. My Rode shock mount is dead silent but does not hold the mic as rigidly as this unit does. I am tempted to return it and try out the other four rubber band AT model but it's more trouble than it's worth."
5,Excellent isolation,"I mounted a shotgun in this mount and mounted the mount on the little accessory slot on top of a Sony HandiCam. Then I ""handled"" the camera like crazy and got only very low frequency, low gain, booms when I actually hit the camera with my fingers. The sound of the actual finger slap was not heard; only a low ""boom"" sound when I hit the camera where shock mount.and the shotgun.were mounted. If I slid my fingers across the camera to make a hissing sound then it didn't pick up anything. I like this mount."
5,Focused!,"No side effect! feel very focused, i don't think too much at night and although it does not put me to sleep, it does relax my mind and makes me feel focused."
1,I don't understand positive reviews,This product did nothing for me except make me slightly nauseous and give me a headache. Very disappointed. I would not recommend it to anyone.
5,They Work,"Okay, short of a prescription, these are a great alternative. I really feel that taking them with coffee helps. I think they work very well. I stick to two like the bottle indicates, but I'd like to take three some days."
3,Not sure of its benefits.......,"Maybe to early to tell, but I haven't experienced any of the benefits of this product after four ""doses"" so to speak. Don't feel any more relaxed or sleepy at night time. Will keep on taking it to see if I can feel some change in my metabolism......"
2,Oh Brother!,"See the comercial at hasbro.com!!! I think this toy would be fun for two days for a child (5-10) and out of the question for (11-up). A very young child, not too young for the bear's bottle (choking hazard) would have fun with this."
1,Sony Stinks Again!,"Once again Sony is lagging from making good products. Sony used to be top of the line buy but has fallen further down the line as they think the name can sell their products. Sony products are ""has been."" They lack quality. My television lasted a little over four years and went out. The stand by light blinks 9 times and the tv never turns on. If you do any research this is a common issue Sony buyers have. The worst part is there is nothing we can do. The part is no longer made. Their suggestion was to have a repair man come out and see what they can do. Yeah!!! Thanks for nothing! Buy that time, I can purchase a much better tv from Samsung or Panasonic and spend the same amount for a newer better tv and guaranteed to have it work!!! Thanks again for nothing Sony!!!"
1,With all due respect to the reviewer who follows ...,"I find this very hard to listen to. I bought this CD because I love what Uri Caine did for Mahler's music. That recording is very instructive, inspiring and a brilliant testimony to Caine's genius as a jazz musician.I also have a number of CD's in other languages, whether Hindi, Arabic, American Indian or whatever, that feature singing in vocables - or what I interpret are vocables, i.e. singing without forming actual words. So my negativity toward this album is not based on a lack of familiarity with chant-like performance.Generally, every musical album has something worthwhile in it somewhere. You have to listen awfully hard with this one. What is supposed to be singing sounds more like caterwauling to me.If the prospective buyer is interested in Jewish jazz, the Mahler interpretations are a wonderful place to start - or maybe just buy some standard klezmer stuff.This, I hate to say, is pretty darn unlistenable."
4,A quick rundown of a great CD,"The band: Clifford Brown, Lou Donaldson, Horace Silver, Curly Russell, Art Blakey. (Should recognize at least Brown, Silver and Blakey - big names in jazz.)The venue: Birdland - ""Jazz Corner of the World""The production: Rudy Van Gelder remaster of a live recording. (Hot, but clean.)The verdict: This is a worthwhile CD and should be in every serious jazz music collector's collection in one form or another (see below). It really swings and is seriously hot live jazz by some of the greatest jazz musicians ever to play music.The caveat: You can buy Clifford Brown'sThe Complete Blue Note & Pacific Jazz Recordings, which contains this CD,A Night at Birdland, Vol. 1,The Eminent Jay Jay Johnson, Vol. 1, and another disc of Clifford's that probably shows up somewhere else but I just haven't found it yet.The summary: If you don't spring for the CB set, get this CD, but be sure and pick up volume one as well for the complete picture of an historic night in jazz history."
5,Great Bebobing Jazz by the Art Blakey Quintet,"Another Great CD to add to my collection. I like the great solo's by the alto sax player Lou Donaldson, especially in the ballad ""If I Had You"". And of course Art Blakey's drum solo's were fabulous, probably the best jazz drummer I've heard. The two Charlie Parker hits, ""Nows the Time"" and ""Confirmation"" are nice also. This an excellent selection for bebob lovers like me"
5,The One,"If Volume 1 of A Night at Birdland was a superior and highly energised bebop set, with the spotlight firmly on the dazzling fecundity of star-crossed trumpet star Clifford Brown, Volume 2 looks toward the future, with a more varied and bluesy set that anticipates the 'hard bop' school. It also presents a more cohesive group sound: alto sax player Lou Donaldson, drummer/leader Blakey, and pianist Horace Silver each get features or the kind of extended solos they were largely denied on Volume 1, making this less a Brownie show and more a nascent version of the Jazz Messengers. The only reason these cuts may have been relegated to Volume 2 is that most of them have moments of ragged ensemble work or minor sonic flaws. These, in no way detract, however, from the heated, you-are-there feeling of these two albums. You'll end up wanting to own both, but I really think Volume 2 is the place to start. From the whipcrack opening through ""Lou's Blues"", A Night at Birdland Volume 2 is one for the ages."
1,poor sound quality and incomplete cadences improperly segmented,The CD has very poor sound quality. The tracks are not broken up into singular cadences.
3,Better alternatives exist,"Plagued throughout both recordings on this disc is the overwhelming sense that the Philadelphia brass are almost out of control. That, or they just don't care. Almost any other version of 1812 is better than this and the Mackerras-LSO version of Sheherazade is far superior. Look elsewhere for these works."
2,ok but better live,"ambulance is one of those bands that can't convert the passion of their live shows into a polished recording. i've seen them about a half dozen times and when i got the cd, i couldn't believe how mediocre the songs sounded. then again, i'm not as crazy about the lyrics as i am about the music.the best song on the album is john. idlewild starts off great but then turns into a jig. joe hughes, the lead singer, has a lovely meloncholy voice and can hit the high notes pretty well.try to see them live and taunt the cute guitarist if you can. he deserves it."
5,TWO SISTER,"A mosaic of short poems laden throughout with deep, strong colors and hard-edge shapes of tears. Yet, the entire layout induces with gentle hues and soft graceful movements of laughter. There is no poetic expertise lacking. Dignity, humility and the true meaning of life became the achevements of the authors. Clearly, if any reader remembers ""THE GOLDEN RULE"", then this book will find its way to the lips and hearts of many parents, teachers and my three sisters. This one gets five rose-cut diamonds from me!"
2,"Newer tapes, worse quality",These tapes are designed with a different type of connector at the end (or the beginning) of the tape so that when you rewind the connector actually breaks the tapes. It uses different technology than they did some time ago. Unless these are very old tapes and they have changed since then. Just not sure. I only know that these tapes just received seem to be breaking frequently.
3,Hour that changes the world,While I haven't read the whole book I after just a couple of chapters feel I need to go back and take notes. The information is so good. I recomend this book to anyone who wants a deeper guide to prayer.
3,good for the tractor pictures,"This book is great for the tractor pictures, but the story that goes along with it is kind of BOOORING!"
5,Tremendous Book!,"My 2 year old son loves tractors, and we love reading to him. This book is one of his favorites. He loves looking at the parts of the tractor, and I like that its a bit more colorful and cute than some of his nonfiction tractor books. Its true that the rhymes in this text are a bit difficult compared to some of the other books, but its probably his favorite. I think I will buy this as a gift book for other children with similar interests! His other favorites from this series are Dazzling Diggers and Terrific Trains."
4,Fun dice game for all,"I bought this dice game primarily for the adults in my extended family. We played with 3 dollar bills. When it came to the children - ages 7 to 18 - they used the chips to play. (I bought two sets of the game so I had extra chips). Whoever won got a prize (cash, gift card, etc). They had a blast."
1,"Recognizes my voice, but not what I'm saying","I've had this headset for about 9 months. The only reason it has taken me this long to replace it is a lack of money. It has been driving me crazy the whole 9 months. Here's why:1. To connect to my phone via the bluetooth I have to turn it on then turn it off, then turn it on again. Sometimes I have to repeat this two or three times. (It's not the phone. I've checked.)2. When I voice dial sometimes it doesn't transmit what I say correctly. Ex: I say ""work"" to call my office. It confirms ""Brian"" and calls my friend. (Again, not the phone. I've checked.)3. It's so loose on my ear that I have to hold it tight to my head so I can hear. So much for hands free. And I often have to cup my hand over the microphone and my mouth so I can be heard. I might as well hold the phone!Really don't bother getting this one. It's a waste of money."
3,Great service!!!,"The first bluetooth was not working properly and I did the complaint,at two days I got the new bluetooth...WOW!!!! what a service!!!!"
1,ANOTHER MADE IN CHINA PIECE OF SH*T!!!!,"SAVE YOUR TROUBLE AND TIME,- JUST DON'T BUY Monster Cable iCarPlay Wireless FM Transmitter:I BROUGHT THIS Monster Cable iCarPlay Wireless FM Transmitter 2 TIMES, FROM DIFFERENT LOCATION/STORE.....- BOTH NOT WORKING AFTER ABOUT 15-20 DAYS.-THEN I SWITCH TO OTHER COMPANY CONNECTION WHICH IS{MADE IN TAIWAN}, IT WORKS AND SOUND PERFECTLY, EVEN NOSELESS! ...NOW I'VE BEEN USING THIS- I'VE BEEN USING CAR CHARGER TYPE OF CONNECTION FOR A LONG TIME, NEVER HAVE PROBLEM.FOR ELECTRONICS, REMEMBER- ONLY BUY FROM MADE IN TAIWAN OR JAPAN!!!!!!!!!"
3,The car's antenna seems to matter here.,"I rented a couple of cars with standard whip antenna and it seemed to work ok - thought there was more background hiss than I would like though. Moreso than a cassette adapter.My crown victoria, with antennain the windshield gives poor reception, compared to off-air radio. Since I listen to classical music (quiet passages) it's a bit tedious.Aalso the restriction on number of tunable channels is less-than-desirable. In urban areas all the pre-sets may be taken.If I paid about $25 forthe thing I'd say it was a reasonable deal, but not worth the $50 CompUSA price.Sales guy recommended it - next time I'm buying where there's no restocking fee!"
1,"I remember when ""Monster"" stood for quality","Ever since Monster decided to mass-market everything that they possibly could, their quality has been steadily declining. This product doesn't even live up to what I expect from a budget brand.The transmission strength seems very low, it seems very hard for the car's radio to lock onto the signal. Even after managing to get the car's stereo to tune in properly, there is considerable hiss and distortion. In addition to that, the sound level is very low, so you need to crank your car stereo volume way up, which only amplifies the background hiss and distortions more.I replaced with with a Belkin Tunecast II. The signal from it is clearer (almost as clear as a regular broadcast radio station), stronger, and louder. All around a better device."
1,"VERY quiet signal, lots of interference","This thing is really, really lame. The signal is extremely, extremely quiet. I have to turn up my stereo twice as high as normal to get the music 2/3rds as loud, with a bunch of static (on every station I try) to boot. If I'm using this thing, and I switch to a normal radio station or my CD player without turning the volume back down first, I have no doubt that my speakers would be blown. Monster Cable is supposed to be high quality (although waaaaaaaay overpriced); this item is just another knock in my declining perception of the company.This is the second FM transmitter I've tried with my iPod, and they've both sucked. I'm pretty much convinced that I have to either get a tape adapter (which means getting a new car stereo that has a tape deck...) or find an iPod-integration solution like what's available on BMW's (which also means getting a new car stereo...) if I want to get decent sound from my iPod to my car stereo."
4,"Fine for single-city use, okay for road trip","I got the Monster transmitter specifically to listen to audiobooks and podcasts on a 1500-mile round trip through the Southeast. I have a Sandisk MP3 player, not an iPod, and found the output volume to be just fine. FM transmission strength is pretty good: it ""outcompeted"" external signals to provide an acceptable sound quality most of the time. Lack of a power-off switch is a minus; it means that if you start getting interference and need to switch stations you must (1) unplug the unit from the 12V DC outlet, (2) tune your car's FM receiver to an unoccupied frequency, (3) plug the Monster back in, and (4) press the frequency switch on the Monster until it is transmitting at the frequency found in step #2. With practice you can manage this while driving with only a couple of glances at the Monster, but it's still an awkward procedure."
1,Do you research better than I did mine,"I have an ipod and wanted to get an fm transmitter for the car. My brother had a great Monster ipod transmitter so I purchased this transmitter only to find that it was very different. This one has only 8 preset stations in the 80's (bad if you live in DC) and does not charge your ipod. Monster does have a GREAT transmitter made specifically for the ipod that gets better reception, allows you to charge the ipod while driving, and offers much more tuning flexibility. Worth the extra 20 bucks, and I feel stupid for having purchased this one first because I didn't understand all the intracacies. Don't make the same mistake."
4,Mostly favorable- no extended road test yet.,"Goal: Transmit audio from our portable DVD player in our Honda Pilot.Observations:- The initial trial while sitting in the driveway was impressive: no hiss, static, etc.- A short trip in town in stop-and-go traffic: noticed a ""whine"" that corresponded to engine speed when accelerating. At the time, we were using the 12V-DC power outlet closest to the engine. We plan to try the outlet in the rear of the Pilot, which is next to the side-window antenna anyway, to see if that helps.Overall, this is very convenient. It's easy to setup and use and provides good sound."
4,The best way to play audio in the car for those who do not have auxuliry,I've tried different ways to play the audio files I have in my smartphone in my car and I find this is the best. This gives you the highest possible quality for those who do not have auxuliry input in their cars.
2,poor.,"no matter what volume or frequency, i get static and distortion. i wonder if the quality varies from unit to unit since some have had no problem.i won't buy one again."
1,low qaulity,This product did not clear receive the I-Pod hooked up to it and station was not clear we returnd the product.
1,It broke fast and with little use,"I was concerned when I purchased this item because many people said that reception and sound was very poor. This was almost never an issue in my experience. However, after using the product (scarcely) for only four months, it has broken. All the wires and connections from the outside look perfect. However, the sound started breaking down and shortly thereafter, the radio tuner would not light up, affectively killing this electronic accessory. NO sound gets through and it is gone. So I paid $40 or so for four months of careful use, and the darn thing broke. I won't buy again from Amazon, and will buy a product with the most coverage or protection."
1,Not worth it,"This product is not worth the effort. The static is so loud, you can't enjoy the music. Would not recommend it to anyone."
2,"good transmitter, bad cable","this has the best transmitter out of the ones i've tried. others put out such a weak signal that i got constant static over the music. this one does much better.however, i've had two of these things and BOTH have come apart at the 1/8"" connector within 3 months. are you kidding me? the same company that made its name selling high quality mike and instrument cables for exorbitant prices suddenly can't manufacture a 1/8"" stereo cord that will last more than a few months? come on guys, what's up with that?as much as monster charges, i shouldn't have to be soldering my own connectors onto these damn things. the only reason i'm giving this shoddy item a second star is because i can't find another transmitter that even delivers a decent signal."
3,"Well, at least it works.","I've tried the Belkin and it really turned me off trying to use an FM transmitter, that is until I read about this one. I knew it wouldn't be perfect, hence only three stars. I will say that it does work, I first used it with my Creative Travel Sound MP3 player and the hiss and high pitched whine was terrible. After disconnecting the player from the dc power inverter, the noises went away, must have been a ground fault loop or something. I use it now with my Zen Micro and it sounds great, although I do have to turn the radio volume up louder than normal. I do wish it had some sort of power off function like the iRock. I don't think any of these things are perfect, there are so many variables inside the car that can cause interference. The FCC sets the transmit levels so they are all going to be fairly low power. I think this transmitter is one of the best on the market (...)."
2,1 fatal flaw...,"I have had one of these 'Monster' transmitters for about 6 months. What happens is that the wire will get worn down (from wiggling, use and in my case cold weather) and you will first lose sound in one speaker then the other. Wiggle the wire and the speaker(s) might come back on. The wire is too thin and just wears out way too fast. It's not to be confused with 'Monster Cable'. I would certainly avoid used ones!"
4,Monster Cable RadioPlay Car Stereo Wireless FM Transmitter (MBL-FM XMTR),"It,s OK, nothing too fancy, but adequate."
1,Full price for half quality,"I recently purchased this FM transmitter because I knew how quality the name was. I was excited after reading other iTrip horror stories because this has a power outlet and does not draw power from the iPod itself, so the transmitting power would be stronger. I paid $50 (way too much) and used it in my Maxima all the way home. We have several cars and it didn't work in any of the other vehicles: 2 Chevys and one VW Passat. It was programmed to work on the lower frequencies and it was as if it was not powerful enough to boradcast over them... and there was no local frequency to over power. Besides, when it did work, there was too much static for me to enjoy the music. I would not reccomend this product."
2,disappointing,"Purchased the transmitter for my MP3 player. Reception is poor with constant static through my car radio. The instructions (which you don't see until you have already purchased the product) says antennas integrated into the window can have problems. Since that is the only purpose for this device, I don't understand why Monster is selling a marginal product."
2,Unleashed in Zambia,"The album rocked, we partied hard while driving our jeeps in the jungle and jamming some Schwamm. The major dissapointment was when we saw him in concert in Zambia, he does not rock as hard in concert. At first the radio DJ compared him to a young Ozzy Osbourne but he looked more like a crazy poodle with that fake perm in his hair and he kept taking breaks to smoke. We spent out hard earned Kwachas and we feel like we were ripped off. We hoped he would hang out afterward and blow a blunt with the homies but he just put on his Schwamm World Tour jacket and got on his donkey and left. Never again will we go to a Schwamm concert but we probably will buy the remasters boxed set when it comes out this fall."
5,Another Great Addition,"Since purchasing the Heroscape Master Set for my brother several years ago, the expansions and figures are all I buy him for holidays. They are a guaranteed success as he loves designing the self-build battlefields and organizing his armies. The heroes in this pack were for his fourteenth birthday, and he immediately needed to engage me in a new battle. Setup and play promote analytical thinking. A fantastic game."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - Cheap knock-off no name brand,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT -- This is advertised as a Cisco power supply yet what i received was some knock-off no name brand product that looks cheap and is made in China. I should have taken the advice from the other reviews!! Product is being returned.
2,Cheap!,"I purchased two of these and one of them makes a whistling sound when plugged in. The supplies I received were NOT Cisco OEM. They were very cheap, light, Chinese knockoff's."
1,NOT a Cisco Product,This item is most definitely a cheap Chinese ripoff of a Cisco product. It creates the most distracting high-pitched whine I've ever heard as soon as it is plugged in. This is a complete rip off for the price.
3,Low impact exercisers please read,"I appreciated all the reviews - helped me in selecting this tape. However, I have a weak knee so I do all my exercising without jumping or leaping. Karen claims to have representatives doing low impact, well I had to make a few modifications (nothing new). If I had to do it again, I'd buy something else, but will add it to my collection & just not use it as often. Otherwise it is a great workout if you like Karen's style."
2,Not bad for a kid,"Bell wrote this when he was very young. In the preface he even hints at embarrassment over its overambitious breadth. His later ""What Is Painting?"" is MUCH better."
1,One word to describe this CD.......................,"...................Weak.Rivera is a sad dissapointment on this one, he has proven himself as a superb spinner. This was beneath him. It's dismaying to see all the garbage thats being released."
4,Nice Book,"I especailly like the illustrations. Content is good too. I wish the author had included something of Pasteur's Christian faith, as is was a great factor in his confident and untiring search for answers to the mysteries puzzling him."
3,TMNT 3 Soundtrack,"I liked ""Tarzan Boy"", ""Can't Stop Rockin'"", and ""Rockin' Over the Beat"" the best. ""Conga"" was a nice adaption. I did not, however, like the rap songs that filled the rest of the CD. That's just because I don't like rap. ""Conga"" wasn't too bad though."
3,It's Okay,The color was true to the picture presented but not the weight of the fabric. It was not as heavy as I expected but overall it will serve it's purpose. I would recommend it for the price and the company was quick with the delivery.
4,denim shirt,This is a nice denim shirt and the price is not too bad! Don't forget they are cotton so make sure you get it big enough! Nice shirt though!
5,Super!,"This denim shirt is just what I've been searching for! It's a nice thick weight and fits me perfectly! Overall, a superior product! I liked it so much I bought two more of them!"
5,Great basic denim shirt,"Hard to find denim shirt with no pockets, but this one fits the bill with thick soft cotton. Feels more expensive than it is."
2,Not for self study and full of errors.,"This book is stuffed with more errors than an unpatched Windows 95 box and gives you the answers to everything before you have the time to think.A book for those who dont like to think for themself in other words. Includes no real scenarios that you can actually practice on without having the solution on the next line.The lab book is also not for self study, but that is to be expected as it is a companion book. Many objectives requires preconfigurations by the instructor, and these preconfigurations are not included in this book.I have bought many lab books in my life but this is worst of them all, by far.-CCSP student in Norway"
5,A Class Book For A Class Brand,"Peterbilt: The Evolution of Class is an excellent history about the ""trucks with the Red Oval"". As an intense truck enthusiast and long-term Pete fan, I feel that this book is a joy to read no matter how many times I pick it up. Neither a ""coffee table book"" nor a photo essay, this volume is loaded with facts and figures about Petes from 1939 to the present. Author Warren Johnson skillfully blends text with a collection of vintage literature and spec sheets (both old and new)to chronicle this legendary truck. The production total at the back of the book are a wonderful touch. I wish there were a few more interior shots, but overall I heartily recommend this item. If you like Petes and other big rigs, you MUST add this book to your collection."
3,Expanded on positives from MOM....,"Tommy Lee's Methods of Mayhem release was an inconsistent album as I have ever heard, ruined by a rap partner and guests galore. Never A Dull Moment took the rock foundations of that album and made it the focus of Tommy's solo release. The result is a surprising hard rock album that probably won't get any attention because he is seen by most as a musician from ""another era"". The track ""Body Architects"" was weak lyrically, in my mind. But, everything else adds up to a record that is very underrated. The best track is ""Higher"", and everyhting else isn't far behind. I hope he continues on a hard rock basis if he continues to go solo."
4,Impressive,"Tommy Lee's 2nd post Motley record is impressive and heartfelt at times as any album I've come across in recent memory. The first single ""Hold me Down"", ""Ashamed"" and the Bowie/Lennon remake titled ""Fame 2"" (which I hope is released as a single) are twice as good as anything from his 1st ""Methods of Mayhem"" release and really twice as good as anything I'm hearing on the radio or MTV.I wasn't gunna give this disc a chance but now I'm glad I did, a solid release that shows Tommy's got the goods for solo success."
4,Excellent - Tommy has finally found his groove!,"No one has ever denyed that he has the talent, but Tommy has struggled in the past to find a place in the new world of rock and roll for which he clearly has a great deal of respect. This album is his strongest effort since going off on his own. Clearly, this one is a labor of love, and the hard work he put in, is obvious. Musically, I have not heard anything better in a long time, and the lyrics are top shelf. Definitely pick this one up, you will not regret it!"
1,Tommy needs to go home,"When will it stop? Now along with the current trend of post grunge, sappy, sensitive rock, we have ex Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee jumping the rap-metal boat (which was the trend at the time when his Methods of Mayhem project was released in 1999) and hitching a ride on this current trend to release another ""solo"" project, this time under his own name. And, the results are dreadful. ""Never A Dull Moment"" is full of the most unoriginal, uninspired music I have ever heard (worse than the Methods of Mayhem material). Every song sounds the same, and evry bit of dignity that Tommy Lee once had (he was THE reason I myself started drumming) is quickly going down the toilet. Skip this, I liked this stuff better when they were Soundgarden."
5,BETTER THAN TOMMY'S work PAMELA,I bought this allbum out of nowhere and now i dont regret it its and AWESOME ALBUMEACH AND EVERY SONG IS WORTH LISTENING ONE OF THE BEST ROCK WORKS IN THE CORRODING ROCK DAYS
5,Cocky,just like Methods of Mayhem but more rock and less about drugsAfterglow 9/10Hold me Down 10/10Body Architects 9/10Ashamed 7/10Fame 02 8/10Blue 7/10Sunday 9/10Why is it 7/10face to face 10/10higher 11/10people so strange 9/10Mr. S***y -not a song but a dumb guy talkin on phone
5,Why some of the negetive feedback?,"I have to give Tommy a lot of credit for what he does and what he NOW stands for. He's been through hell and he's come out with great strength and a drive that I can't help but totally admire in a musician such as himself. He put everything he has both mentally and physically into this album and I think it totally shows! Yeah, he's not the best musician in the universe, but the riffs, the lyrics, and the sounds of Never A Dull Moment are awesome! And Tommy was never a rapper despite the flack he got about that.....he sings like a drummer sings..with rythem! Great album!"
1,They won't allow you to choose no stars.,"If you feel like going the ways of mainstream and listening to the same generic rock that they regurgitate every hour on the radio then this album is your ultimate saviour. I find it difficult to believe some record company thought that this was worth producing. I also find it very sad to think there are people out there that say ""God, I feel this music"" and convince themselves that this is the greatest music can be. Nothing clever on this album. Tommy Lee is making music in a genre that gave up on itself years ago. Tommy, you should do the same and give up. Tommy likes music? Great! Just do us a favor and keep it in your basement for friends. Oh and Tommy's friends, you should be ashamed of telling him that what he does is good. Lying hurts everyone."
2,i just hate pride!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,the first point about this book that i wanted to make was that why do they always win or they always lose.and this wasnt even a really realistic problem.i mean even if you dont agree wiyh the rest of my reveiew you should agree that this just wasnt like ashlegh.she just wouldnt have a problem like this.i was just so dissapointed. p.s.-how is the problem slved just like that??????
3,"plot was okay, facts were not","Okay, the racing aspect of this book was alright, although the problem was solved way too easily. That would never happen in real life. But what really bothered me was the part about Samantha learning to jump. I realize that Sammy is a good rider, but learning to jump 3 feet perfectly in a matter of months is absolutly ridiculas. It takes years to perfect the skill of jumping a course, and it takes years to go from low jumps to 3'. Especially if you are taking 1 lesson a week, like Sammy. I've been jumping for 4 years now, and just last year I started jumping 3 feet, and my courses are still not perfect. Perhaps Sammy's horse never makes a mistake. That's possible. I've seen hunters that don't make mistakes ever. But its just not realistic. And it bothers me because it makes it seem like jumping is so easy."
5,Rockin' Cookbook!,"What an awesome book! Not only does it have terrific recipes but it is very entertaining and informative! My daughter wanted to know what every rock star liked to eat Backstage! We're actually fighting over who will read it first! We can't wait to try out some of the recipes! What a nice idea to donate some of the proceeds to Freedom From Hunger. YOU GUYS ROCK! Ron, Mary and Lisa Holcer"
5,A Wonderfully Entertaining Cookbook,"Not only does this book have some great recipes to try in your own kitchen, it is entertaining as well. Along with the recipes from some of your favorite musicians, you get some history on them, and some insite into their favorite foods and backstage eats.This is a so much more than a cookbook, and will surely making cooking fun even for the non-cook. I will enjoy this one for years to come."
4,Hard to find perfume,"My daughter wanted this perfume for Christmas. I could only find it online. The price was fair and I paid for expedited shipping so that I would not have to worry about getting it in time for Christmas. Unfortunately, the shipping was very late. The original shipper assigned it to another shipping company when they failed to deliver it within the expedited date. It arrived literally just in time for Christmas after several phone calls to the shipping company. Definitely a wasted expense to pay for the expedited shipping. However, the product was exactly as ordered and my daughter loved it!"
2,Lacking Something,"I enjoyed the fun illustrations and lol funny moments but the ending didn't hold much meaning for me. Especially when crying, ""sweet!"" results in Little Pig throwing his toys.I guess it means he learned how to eat without being messy and is celebrating. But it's a book for little children and shouldn't be so confusing.With the right voices and explanation this book could be a fun read-aloud, it just reads too much like a short story that's lacking something for me to give it five stars.I say that because I've read a lot of children's books myself and to others and some only have one line of text and sound complete."
5,Even the big kids loved it,"I also got this at the library and had to buy it. I use it for story time for 2-3 year olds, but my 5 year old got such a kick out of it too. The story is funny, the rhymes are almost musical and the pictures are delightful. Get the hardcover-you'll want this one for a long time."
5,Kate Bjorkman's biggest fan raves about a great romance,"The Unlikely Romance of Kate Bjorkman is a fabulous romance story. This protagonist is so real and so lovable that you can't put the book down and when the book is over you begin to miss the characters so terribly, you have to read it again. I have never read a book where I have grown so attached to the main characters. This book is proof that perfect Christmas romances can still happen and it gives hope to a world that is cynical about love. Kate Bjorkman is a wondeful character and you really feel for her, but she has her head o straight, a fabulous family, and an enjoyable sense of humor. Everyone should be required to read this book before they fall in love."
2,Not impressive,"I checked this book out of the library for a quick read, not expecting substance, but I thought it would be fun. I was right, except it wasn't fun. I usually love romance, but it was very dull in this book. I hated the way the main character told her story. It seemed like Louise Plummer was trying too hard.When I read the book A Dance For Three , I could not believe it was by the same author! So you shouldn't let this book stop you from reading a dance for three, which was very good."
2,Realistic? I think not.,"The entire idea behind The Unlikely Romance of Kate Bjorkman was the fact that this was a 'real' romance. She mentioned how she hated romance novels and how this was her realistic romance- it was real. But as I was reading, I couldn't help but notice that this was just another corny romance story. The tall girl with the glasses, who's always loved her brother's best friend, ends up with him. Of course, there's the gorgeous, sexy girl who is caught by the main character kissing the brother's best friend, but he's forgiven in the end. Of course he's handsome, masculine, extremely nice, funny, and smart. There aren't really any faults in his character, and Kate Bjorkman is the typical romance novel girl. I was extremely disappointed. It was way too cliche- even the names were typical! This was no way a 'real' romance, but another corny and hopelessly romantic love story that should have come from Disney."
2,Too many characters,"It's really not the authors' fault, but there are so many people that worked on this case, it is confusing trying to keep everyone straight. Same with the victims. To me, this book never fully developed the characters. It's more like a rundown of what happened, but nothing of substance. This book is mainly about Malvo and Muhammed, but who are they really? At the end there is a brief conversation from Malvo that was very interesting because it gave some feedback on what he'd done, but that's it. I just felt a void, like what was really the point? By the end I was ready to be done with the book and move onto something better. I bought this from a book club and wish I hadn't."
1,Just like disappointed...BUT WORSE,"Well, just like disappointed, my brass connector also broke. This is worse, BECAUSE IT WAS ALREADY IN MY WALL!!! I now have to pay to have a new cable put in the wall."
5,Great cable at a great price!,This is a great cable at a great price. Why spend the extra $$$ on Monstrous (like the company) cables when you can get a great cable like this from Amazon for a much cheaper price. I used it to get 1080p output on my projector using a 1080p receiver and 1080p DVD player.
2,It was great when it worked,"I bought 3 of these cables about 2 years ago from Amazon. They appear to be of quality construction-but they are not. After 2 years we had to move our TV, so we removed the cable. When we plugged it back in I get no signal. Called Amazon as it is advertised as a Lifetime Warranty. They gave the the number of the company, which only takes Email for tech support. I don't need tech support I need a new cable. So far no return call. Bought a different cable and it works fine. Don't buy this cable. Although molded etc. it is poor quality."
5,Great Cable Cord!!!,I hooked this cable cord up to my Samsung lnt40fx 120hz HDTV and my Comcast cable. I almost fell on the floor when I saw the picture. The quality of the picture was amazing!The cord itself was heavy. The quality of this cord is very good. It didn't look cheap at all. I liked the color of the cord it went with my bedroom. I would buy another cord from this company again with no problem.No need to spend $100 dollars on a Monster cord when you can buy this one and get the same results. Also if you buy an HDTV that has 120hz you have to buy an HDMI cable cord that has 10.2 gb and not all HDMI cable cords have that but this one does.
2,"Works great, but never unplug them!","Works great! The cable itself is high-quality and seems to be well shielded. Like other reviewers, when I unplugged them to move the equipement, the inner portion of the plug stayed with the equipment! There is no way to have it fix."
4,Exactly what I expected,"The item is exactly what you'd expect when buying a high end product at a low cost. Are these the best cables you can get? no, but they're good quality for passing the HD channels to my TV and they were rugged enough to be passed through the wall. All and all, for the price and quality I would recommend this item"
5,Full of laughs!,I can't stop watching this show! I'm hoping that they do not cancel this show because I love it! The Jeffery character reminds me of my husband in many ways. (probably why I find him so hilarious) I would definitely recommend this show if you are looking for a good laugh.
4,Welcome to the mid 30's to 40's !!!!,"Rules of Engagement Season 2I have waited for a show like this for a while. When we were young The Jeffersons, All in the Family, etc. then in our teens to 20's was 30 Something, Friends. So now a little bit older and we have a funny show for the age I'm at and can relate to. All the little jokes that hit home. It will remind you when you were single and dating or engaged and at last to be married for a long time Happily too. I do like the fact that kids is not in this picture because it can take you to a mind set that I think we forget when we do have kids. So let it take you back in years or enjoy what you have, and have fun watching the show."
5,Love this Show!,"I love this show, and it seems to get better and better. I just wish they would get rid of David Spade! He's one of the most annoying, obnoxious actors around. NO ONE IS BUYING HIM AS A ""LADY'S MAN""!!! In fact, Spade is the only negative in the whole show. Even as obnoxious and irritating as he is, he's not quite as bad in this show as he's been in most others, and the people running things seem to know when they're getting too much Spade, and keep it balanced pretty well. The others in the cast are excellent (I love Jeff!), and it's just plain funny.Re: this DVD set, it's very good. The whole season, plus a good deal of extras. I'm not big on extras, so those really aren't for me, but I love having the ability to watch the shows right in a row.Highly recommended!"
2,"Decent Show, Terrible Audio Mix","I like the show, but the versions available here on Amazon have a TERRIBLE audio mix that is driving me crazy. The laugh track and music track way dominate the volume of the actors audio track. It's frustrating because you turn the volume up to hear what the actors are saying and then BAM music starts in for a cut scene and it blasts your ears off. They REALLY need to fix this. I tried adjusting my receiver mix so that the center channel (the only place the actors audio channel comes through) was louder, but the music and laugh track is REALLY LOUD on here too. You might want to go elsewhere for this show."
5,Wonderful Cast Recording,"This is such a wonderful musical - Cole Porter at his best - I listen to it over and over and over. I'm very proud to be producing it for a Northern California Community Theater group - a ""Silicon Valley Premiere"" since only A.C.T. has done it before my group. Wondeful melodies, music, lyrics - everything. I can picture the show unfolding and the love that is truly evident between Tracy and Dexter, though she has to learn a few things 'bout life first - and come off her ""holier than thou"" cloud. A wonderful theater experience!"
4,Well-researched; will interest political junkies most,"Elizabeth Drew has brought years of experience and contactwork to the effort to cast light behind one of the mostconflict-ridden periods in recent American politics.Parting the curtains of public affairs rhetoric and thepap spoon-fed to the nightly news shows, she shows thereader both the hard policy considerations and the fragileegos at play in the 1994-1995 battles between Bill Clinton'sWhite House and Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives.Two caveats: 1) for political junkies only; if you don'teat, breathe and sleep political intrigue, you ain't gonnacare; 2) the editor could have done a little better job ofsmoothing Drew's dry journalistic style into a somewhatmore flowing and readable narrative."
2,Well done,"By well done I mean creating so much ado about so little. With so many reviewers speaking out about a record like this, I must say that Ms. Daly has managed to create a topic for discussion. When another reviewer makes a statement about the record being great and then nods to what she disgracingly calls jazz reminiscent of a rugby match, I start to understand why a project like this gets such a big following. I have to congratulate Ms. Daly on making a record filling a hole. For all of you feeling too many jazz records sound like a rugby match (and that must really be a bad thing!?!) and want to satisfy a hunger for mediocre, background restaurant jazz/music, go buy this one. For those seriously interested in jazz, try something else.The two stars are for the great George Garzone, contributing a song and two supreme, entertaining solos."
2,Mediocre.,"I've listened to this album at least fifteen times now, searching for something to thrill me. The song selection is fine, and so is the sound. Garzone guesting on two tracks is the high point for me, other than that I feel the record falls a tad flat. Those who have expressed their love for this one, by giving it five stars (as one would give the most outstanding, classic albums of any genre) are looking at a life of easy satisfaction. In deed."
4,Pure Swing,"This is an honest, from the heart, collection of classic standards that swings very hard. The musicianship is excellent, well crafted, straight-ahead playing, and the recording quality and sound are excellent. Claire's bari sax playing is clear and to the point--great sound, clean technique, well-stated ideas. It is a refreshing change from all the jazz that is the musical equivalent of a rugby match. This CD is about music and SWING so if you want a big ugly note fest, well then, you probably won't dig it. Otherwise, you can't lose with this CD CD."
2,It swings,"(Not everybody can be a Gerry Mulligan, Serge Chaloff, Lars Gullin (Sweden), Gary Smulyan, Ronnie Cuber (despite his sound), Nick Brignola or John Pl Inderberg (Norway). These are some truly great baritone players from around the world, alive or deceased.)This is just above mediocre. Something borrowed, something blue, nothing new. But it swings. The band is good. Garzone is great, as a couple of other reviewers have remarked. I'm sorry, Daly, you don't quite do it for me. Not yet, anyhow. I'm a listener who loves changing my opinion, and with so few good baritone players around, I will be watching your next move!"
3,odd facts,this says its not out till feb 2012 however i just purchases this item last night at my local walmart
5,For a B rated movie,"I know the wrestlers and rappers really don't have the acting experience as real actors but the movie was pretty good, seeing I watch B rated movies and is a WWE fan."
1,Disappointed,This item came with instructions that were backward and parts taht were pictured in the instructions that there was no reference to in the written instruction. When assembled the mirrors would not stay closed and the weight of the double sided mirror was enough to pull the mirror off of it's mount due to imballance. The manufacturer did replace the item that they said must have been defective but when the new mirror came it was exactly the same. The fit and finish of the mirrors was also not up to standards.
2,Rating this overrated product,"This product was recommended to me by more than one source and is supposed to be specifically designed for exactly the application I'm using for - to remove wood-grain applique from a late 1970's station wagon. I had used a couple of cans of ""aircraft stripper"" from the local chain auto parts store prior to using this and quite frankly, it worked much better. When you spray this product it creates a white film over the area you want to remove and anything else nearby but very little of the woodgrain actually came up despite repeated attempts. This product comes in a large can but I used an entire can of it with very little results. I am extremely disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone."
5,Filter...,"What can you say... It is a HEPA filter, and it filters air for the unit correctly... Will continue to purchase from these folks."
5,Nothing like It,To hear the genius at work at age 15 is an incredibly breath taking experience. Thee birth of Romanticism.
5,It does what it says on the packet,It gives a weight reading - what more do you want?Unlike some others .. it gives the same measurement if you weigh yourself more than once - which gives you a certain amount of confidence.
2,Ehhhh...,"Alright, maybe it was just my luck with this one, but our scale hardly ever works. It says there's supposed to be a low battery indicator, but it's never appeared on my scale when it DOES work... which is rarely. No, it's not because I'm stepping on it wrong to get it to turn on, or anything funky like that. There is honestly just something wrong with it. I gave it two stars, though, because on the times when it DOES work it's pretty accurate."
1,Do not buy!!!,This is just a waste of money and the time that it took to purchase. If you are considering one of these scales be advised that it will not be accurate as it states. Mine is approximately 9-10 lbs. off.
3,why I think the scale is just okay,the scale is ok and nice and light but to read the numbers I have to put my glasses on and really stare hard. the numbers are not lit up enough like my old scale or bold enough so you can see them easily.
3,ok...but...,"i think this was a decent scale, but the battery it came with died after 4 weigh-ins. evidently this has been sitting on a shelf for a very long time for that to happen."
3,Bathroom Scale,"It's OK but I wouldn't recommend it. It has a flimsy, plastic frame and only holds up to 300 lbs"
2,Not Impressed,"The scale is not accurate at all. It fluctuates and it does not read right. It reads below my actual weight...which is really bad. I am 115lbs and sometimes I get up to 120lbs for a day or two but it reads about 94 and when I am 120lbs, its says 98. I guess the quality is as cheap as the price."
1,Scale Stopped Working,"This scale worked the first time that I used it, but has stopped working (the battery isn't dead). Since I've already disposed of the packing slip, I won't be able to return it. Oh well, I guess those are the risks that you take buying on-line."
3,Supplemental reading only...,"This slim book offers information on all types of scales but does not come with the absolute basics of where on the fret board do you play them. It's more intellectual than a real beginner ""how-to"" book. It does make a nice supplement and may work for those with a little music theory background (and can already read music)."
4,Scales and the bass ....,"This book is a great resource for begining bass scales. It explains the thoery and practise rather well. As with the `first' book (if thats apropriate), Play Bass Guitar, it takes a great deal of time to understand what is being said without confusion. However, this time the book feels better layed out. All-in-all, it will help u understand bass scale theory, prehaps inprove your timing,while using the CD as a back up. + It contains jazz, rock, and other `styles' of scales. Therefore, hard to read at points, but worth a look."
5,another gem by Oistrakh,Such a gem for less than $6?I also purchased Mozart Vn concerto 4-5.Couldn't be happier.
5,The ultimate text,A must for medical students and residents. This book covers virtually all possible wounds. A must own.
4,Great Book for Emergency medicine rotations,This is a great book that has helped me a lot to learn how to handle many situations during my work at the emergency department.
5,Very good investment,"I am a non-surgeon so I needed a review. "" an old dog tryingto relearn some old tricks"". Very good book for what I needed."
3,"Dr.A.F.Borges in Reference, comments on Dr.Trott's statement","On this book p.17 Dr.Trott references Dr. Albert F.Borges from ""Elective Incisions and Scar Revision"":...dynamic forces on the skin... ""These forces are created by the underlying pull of muscles in any given body area and correspond to wrinkle created by compression on the skin during muscle contraction.""Note that on p. 4 of Dr. Borges book by Little, Brown & Co., titled Elective Incisions and Scar Revision (1973) he states: ""Certain creases formed by muscle contraction in particular area do not coincide with the RSTL...It is common error among surgeons to equate the skin tension lines with wrinkle lines, particularly in some elderly persons, or with crease lines formed by contraction of certain muscles. The wrinkle lines of muscular contraction can be made in almost any direction, depending on which muscle or set of muscles is being contracted..."""
1,"Look out--don't get the ""Miniature Edition""!","Without realizing it (the Amazon page showed the reviews for the full-length book), I mistakenly ordered a little ""Inspirio/Zondervan Miniature Edition"". This is an itsy little 3"" square condensation of the full-length book--NOT WHAT I HAD IN MIND!!! I'm posting this on the page for the miniature edition, and we'll see if it gets added to the reviews for the full-length book. BINGO!--sorry to see that it DID get posted on the page for the full-length book, a very different product than what I was reviewing. Sorry to see that this review reflects upon that product just as I was sorry to discover that all the glowing reviews of that product reflected upon the little thing I purchased.This is a case where purchasing the book at a bookstore rather than Amazon would have had a better outcome. Oh well!"
1,This book is boring!,"My fiance' and I were required to read this book by the chaplain who is performing our wedding; though very FEW points are valid, the book overall is quite boring and extremely outdated! I would not suggest this to any couple. We were unable to relate to any of it, and found many of the stories irrelevant and cheesy."
1,"terrible, super obvious info","My husband and I were required by our pastor to do this before we got married. We laughed through the whole thing. This was such a waste of time, most of the info is just common sense stuff. the illustrations are super lame and cheesy. Also, throughout the book the author continues to promote and advertise the other books he has written."
3,Not what I expected,It wasn&#699;t as affective as I thought. It was definitely helpful but didn&#699;t hit the problems that my boyfriend and I were facing. I would still recommend it compared to nothing. It did start great discussions that helps us.
4,Saving your marriage before it starts,"Saving your marriage before it starts was recommended to me by a friend and I have found it to be a fantastic reference! It is an easy and fast read, and does an excellent job of allowing the reader to think from the other partners perspective."
5,One of the best pre-marriage books on the market!,"As a Marriage and Family Therapist, I highly recommend this book. My husband and I went through it together after being married less than a year and it was a GREAT resource and still is a great reminder of how to keep our marriage working well. I especially enjoyed the chapter on how to fight a good fight- because we ALL do it and need help in not damaging our relationships for the long haul in the process of working out our differences. I use this book (and the workbook) for many of the couples I counsel and find it hits most of the important areas and is an easy read. I actually think it has helpful information for most couples, not the only pre-married."
4,definitely worth reading,"My fiancee and I are in the process of using this book for our pre-marital counseling. It is good, it definitely has some good suggestions and is very thought provoking. Some of the exercises in the workbook are a bit rigid and unclear but overall I have found it to be great. Covers a variety of topics from communication to misunderstandings to intimacy.A good investment."
2,Rather disappointed,"I ordered this book, but either I didn't look close enough or the seller did little to advertise this information, but when it came the book was a 3"" x 3"" book! It was tiny, and it was a pretty pointless buy because I had been expecting the actual human-sized version of the book so that I could use it. There really is no purpose to buying a tiny book like that if you actually intend to use it as a pre-marital resource. The only good thing was that it arrived on time and in good shape."
1,Misleading & Dissapointing,"There is a lot of bubble gum phscyo babble that you have to wade through before you can actually get something out of the book. They could have made this book a 7 page pamphlet and sold it for 99 cents at 7-11. Also - the book is worthless unless you buy the workbooks. Of course, the workbooks don't come with the book and of course, they cost extra.I took the advice of another reviewer and found and read I Pledge You My Troth. Took some effort to find but well worth it. By far, the best literature I have found on Relationships and Marriage."
3,Agree with Virginia Reader,"Yes. This book was a great source of pre-marital questions and awnsers, but it did indeed have a hidden agenda. I too would not have purchased the book knowing that the entire last chapter was based on Christian principals and marriage."
1,Bible-Belt Baloney,"Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts describesmarriage as "" a supernatural event founded upona mutual exchange of holy pledges."" The authorssave this description for the last chapter, however, from the third chapter on the book iscreepily christianic. They ultimately trivializeall advice that can be found in seminars, counseling, mentors, and books, presumably, even their own. All that a marriage really needs is religion. I want my money back!"
2,Decent read (we have a sec ond one we would recomend) Elizabeth and Jameson Thottam,"This our first book someone lent us and thought it was nice at best (see our reviews on the sec ond book on marriage it was a better primer on does and don'ts which covered a lot good tips on how to relate with eachother and drivers most of its analysis from insider trading tips on successful relationships).My husband, Jameson Thottam, and I lead busy work lives working across coasts (him in the mortgage company working for firms such as Battery Ventures/Loan Page, IndyMac Bank, Homestore and myself on the East Coast) and its always nice to get insights from others.This book gave us some okay insights on how to manage both...Hope that helps,Elizabeth and Jameson Thottam(see sec ond book review)"
4,Amazing Resource,"As a pastor of 30+ years, I've used this book as one of my tools in pre-marital counseling sessions with clients. It allows me to help couples dig deeper into their backgrounds, family heritage etc. as they explore issues that might become problems later on in their marriages. It is a great resource."
4,Good enough,We ordered these to use in a structured marriage seminar. It was the old version but it has most of the same data. The cost was great too. So this is good enough for us.
5,Married 28 years...If we had read this book we might still be!,I was married for 28 years....we would not have gotten a divorce if we had read this book years ago! Not just for those thinking about getting married...this book is for everyone experiencing difficulity at any time!
2,Practical but not really Biblical,"I actually did enjoy reading Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts and found it very helpful for my life. I'm sure my future spouse will be grateful that I read it. I would only recommend this to those who understand a Biblical counseling perspective first though. There are some major anthropological issues here...such as viewing man as some cup that needs to be filled by his partner. Also, the Scripture references are used to support the case studies instead of vice versa."
5,Great Resource,"I bought this book for my daughter, who is a new Pastor and she uses it when counseling couples preparing to get married. They all love this book. It has been a blessing for everyone involved in these upcoming marriages."
4,Short and to the point!,This little book is a quick read. Makes good fundamental points. Not big into reading? This is your book. It is very short and has great insights.
3,Peaches,"I would like to see more of the early episodes of Zoom. There was not enough coverage for each group of zoomers. Is it possible to get more episodes of 1972 and 1973? If so, please include me on your mailing list. What are the zoomers doing now? Is there a video or dvd showing interviews or the life styles of how the once before zoomers? I am really a nostalgic fan. Thanks for all your efforts towards putting all of the Zoom episodes together!"
3,Just like the one at the hospital,We got one of these for home since we have a lot of visitors. It's near the door and very convenient to use. I was surprised at how easy it was to set up and use- I just handed it to my husband and in ten minutes we were good to go;) We haven't had it long enough to judge if we have fewer infections - I'll try to update in the spring.
4,good,i like this because i can use it downstairs while working out. the only thing i did not like was it did not come with santizer it came separte and had to buy
5,"Easy, Cheap and Permanent","They work as advertised, the have a clean professional look and they stick to the wall so well that they ain't never coming down."
5,simply stunning,"I was introduced to Patricia Barber via the audiophile route as her cdsrecording quality has always been excellent. Over the years I got to appreciate her music. What I love about Partricia Barber is that she has a sound like no one else, her piano playing is first class, and her songwriting is sublime and original. Each of Miss Barber cd been another step forward, and this one is full of surprise catching you unawareat every turn. I am really tired of the old format of a singer being backed by the standard piano trio, singing the same old songs.Miss Barber is different she is absolutely unique and I am sure in the years to come will be regarded as one of the great innovator in vocal jazz.Coming back to the audio quality, this is simply the best recording I ever heard, natural, dynamic etc it has everything a real show stopper.Can I give it a million stars??Definetely my choice for cd of the year, in all categories."
3,Tries too hard,"While I can admire the attempt at originality, I can't really get all that into Barber's Mythologies. There are enough compelling instrumental passages so as to suggest the nature of this being important work, but this female Jazz singer just doesn't compliment the mood properly, with an overabundance of cleverly conscious lyrics and stiff delivery crushing most musical momentum. Ambition may contribute to the overall pretentious mood, but enough compositional salvation makes the disc at least worth checking out."
2,Trimmer just doesn't cut.,"Product doesn't trim close enough to get that line that you want. Still need a razor to get close enough. You have to slide the clippers multiple ways to trick the hair into getting cut, and even then it doesn't cut evenly along the line.Occasionally the trimmer makes a noise as if something is loose and vibrating around.Trimmer body has marks on it as if it was dropped - probably just shipping though.Decent quantity of kit contents for the price."
3,it's ok,"Great for beginners. There were some challenging parts to it, but I would like more. Amy's breathless body series are much more intense!"
5,Love Amy's workouts.,This is the fourth video I bought of Amy's. I love her workouts. Her exercises are different and fun and she makes you sweat!
5,Wonderful workout,Amy Dixon is a great instructor. Love how she isn't repetitive and gets most of the muscle groups. Make sure to add the bonus section for core and stretch so you truly get the well rounded workout.
5,Great,"I never did any of amy's tapes but this one is excellent, i worked up a sweat and had a great time doing it, she has a kickboxing section and then weights, and her weight section is great A must buy"
5,Great Intro to Fine Art for Children of All Ages,"My 6-year-old daughter loves this book. It provides and outstanding introduction to painting and art history, using a clever story to teach children about symbolism and meaning in fine art. After reading this book one time, my daughter was able to look through one of my husband's art history textbooks and pick out paintings by the same artists as some of those discussed in Dan's Angel. She was also able to look at completely unfamiliar paintings and excitedly talk about how they make her feel and what they might ""mean."" I wish there were more books like this available!!"
4,Excellent movie for young girls,"This is first of the Saddle Club videos and is excellent for an 8-12 year old girl who loves horses and is interested in the interaction between the girls. As one who was not too involved in reading, the Saddle Club videos have resulted in an interest in the Saddle Club books for the 9 year old and she is happily reading through the series and other books too. The Saddle club videos seem to be wholesome entertainment. Along with the horse riding and horse care, the girls in the videos deal with conflicts and problems and sort them out with kindness. There is usually a selfish girl and they learn how to deal with her. Yet the videos don't come across as instructional or sermonizing, but as very enjoyable."
5,Saddle Club,I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter who LOVES horses. Her mom told me that they were happy to get the series because they can no longer view it on TV. I really appreciated the prompt service. The product was in excellent condition.
5,10 Year Old Daughter LOVES These!,We have been getting the Saddle Club DVDs from the library. I bought this collection and it is just fantastic. My 10 year old daughter has watched these 24 (roughly) episodes at least 3 times each already.This is a great collection - can't wait to see if more show up. Highly recommended for kids of all ages with interests in horses.
2,Hard to rate this one,All three CD's freeze at a certain place while playing. I'm sure my granddaughter would have loved them if they would have played.
2,cracked dvd,I received the dvd set and the first dvd had a crack and unable to play. The other two dvd's were fine.
5,Impact Adapter,"I have put it to it. Repeated hard use on a 111 pound impact driver. Has not broken yet, so it must be good."
2,Quality just not there,"I sent this product back. First, it was orange, not red. Second, the quality of the material was not what I would have expected from Osprey."
2,Mario Lanza is great,Mario Lanza is definitive a great singer (and a underrated one).Hm... good idea to make a Soundtrack CD with 2 movies of him. For Marion Lanza lovers would be the CD perfect.But where is Kathryn Grayson?.Hope the full soundtrack will be released one time of both movies.
2,lack of quality,"I wanted to learn how to play a harmonica, and the guy at the music store recommended this harp and this bookThe Complete Idiot's Guide to Playing the Harmonica, 2nd Edition. Unfortunately, not all the notes (holes) work. The #2 (E) doesn't work, and the #1 (C) and #3 (G) are spotty, so no first C chord. I can hear the air blowing through or around, but the holes seem clogged whether I'm blowing easy or hard and make a terrible sounding note (my family cringes and can tell I'm blowing that note when I try). The other notes work just fine and sound good. Most of the other reviews praise this model, but mine is defective and doesn't inspire me to practice. I don't know if it's the reed (which I suspect) or how to fix it or replace it, but I shouldn't have to in a new product. Not recommended (at least for beginners)."
5,"Great Product, Slow Shipping","The item itself was in very good condition, but it took a lot longer than expected to ship. It was expected to come before Christmas, but I did not get it until January 7th."
3,Good Harmonica...but,"I love the sound I can get from the old MB but my biggest problem is that it isn't the most durable for a long time of play. For one thing it isn't made to be taken apart to be cleaned. If you get too gunked up or get a stuck reed you are basically out of luck. Also, the wood comb isn't the most air tight comb out there. For my money the Hohner Special 20 is a better buy. It's about $5-10 more depending where you look but being able to take it apart will allow you to enjoy it longer."
5,Great harp,"Learned to play on a Marine Band - upgraded after it was lost in one of many moves, and haven't been able to duplicate the sound on either of the other two Hohner's I currently have. It's a great, uncomplicated instrument that allows for lots of versatility. I played mine for 5+ years (fairly regularly) and never noticed any problems or loss of tone."
4,Not a bad price for such a great sound,"These really do sounds great!The brass edges are a bit rough, but I'm sure I'll get used to it."
3,"Nice and small backpack, but not good for rain","I bought this backpack to go to work, because my Jansport was too big and I wanted something smaller. In spite of its small size, it's quite spacious: all of my things, including newspapaper, fit. In terms of weight, it can hold a small thermos of tea and a couple of books. However, this backpack is only good for good weather: it is not waterproof, and in the rain the inside gets wet. I found that to be the only downside of this backpack; the price was great; I've had it for a few months now. I discovered that similar small backpack Northface Pandora is not waterproof either; that one cost $40 and got torn within weeks (and I wasn't trekking with it, just took subway to school)."
3,dragon steering wheel cover,"SImple steering wheel cover with an awesome design. I just happened to already have the same picture on my seat covers, so it wasn't a hard choice. It does not provide much cushion for the hands, but still has good grip."
2,"Cool Design, Bad Quality",At just about any car parts store you can find sets of steering wheel covers of much higher quality for the exact same price. So unless you have your heart set on dragons I wouldn't recommend this cover. The raised dragon which is the only reason to get this isn't even that great looking once you have it in person.
1,item tore when my husband tried to install it,I bought this wheel cover for my husband to replace an identical one that was old and fraying. It ripped when he was trying to stretch it onto the steering wheel.
2,"Very nice, but too tight and ripped when I put it on","It looks nice, came quickly, and feels nice.I have a 2000 Toyota Carolla and it was very, very difficult to put on. My father came to help me and commented that it is the tightest steering wheel cover he has ever put on. As he tried, it ripped on one side. With the rip, it fits. So it works, but I now have a rip in it."
5,cute,"nice book, great pics, glad that I bought it, love all of the Tomie dePaola books, can't wait to get more"
2,Ugh!,"Here is a book that seems like it should be great for a Magic player, but in the end, it is a waste of money. PT interviewees have very little to say, and practically no informatin can be gained from this book that you can't get from ... other magic sites."
3,Hmmm~,"This book is very hard to understand...I should say, i dont really understand it..I recommend to buy another book rather than this."
2,very noisy!!!,"I bought this as a gift for my 1 year old nephew. He loved it, however, his mom woke up at 3 am because the pelican would not stop sqwuaking! She couldn't get the batteries out and started to hit it to make it stop! Finally, after about fifteen minutes she placed it into the fridge and eventually the batteries wore out! Very durable, but very noisy!"
3,Great except for the suction cups!,"My 2 year old loves cause and effect toys, and bathtime, so I knew he would love this. I let him use a cup to ""give juice"" to the pelican since he cannot fill the squirt fish by himself. He laughes when the bird squawks 4-5 times after the filled bucket tips over. The sounds stop when the bucket rises back into position. My only complaint has to do with the suction cups. Like most toys in this catagory they just do not stay, the entire things falls, and I don't like the idea of a battery sitting in the bathtub with him. So right now, I have it tied with string at our shower caddy so he can play with it as intended and I don't have to worry about water going in the battery compartment or it falling. (I guess you could go to the hardware store to buy the bigger suction cups too) I would have returned it, but he really does love the toy and even stayed in the bathtub an extra 25 mins just to play with it."
2,Not at all what I expected,"While the book may be of some use to folks who are completely unfamiliar with PI, I was a bit disappointed. It reads almost as a restatement of the PI user's guide (""this button does this..."") rather than as a guidebook to innovative use of PI (""In order to get this effect, use these buttons and filters in this sequence . . ."") that the title rather led me to expect. To be sure, the author does have an excellent and thorough web site with exactly that kind of hands-on ""how do I do this?"" data, but it was a bit of a let-down to find the book contains virtually nothing of the sort."
5,It performs as expected,"Not much to say here other than this product securely holds the INNO in both it's pocket/insert and to my arm. It's easy to put on and remove and there is virtually no risk in fumbling the INNO while attaching it to my arm. You must be careful removing the player from the pocket because it's held in securely and requires a good deal of pressure to remove. Additionally, this armband is of good construction and material qualigy."
2,Okay product but too loose for someone with smaller arms,I wish the velcro portion was a little more substantial on this product. I have to put the cuff over several layers of clothing in order to prevent it from being too loose when on my arm.
4,A Very Good Buy!,"Ya, I have to agree with the other person that has a review about the product. If you are going to run or work out with your Inno/Helix this is a great armband! Very comfortable and I like the fact that the area where you touch the button is uncovered, but the screen is. Because the buttons are uncovered it make it a lot easier to change between MP3's and XM Radio among other features. Truly a must buy for some body that wants to protect their investment."
1,DO NOT BUY. Works horrible for reception.,I bought this product thinking that it would help me to go running outside with my Inno and still get reception. This product completely destroyed my reception. Do not buy it if you want an XM Radio signal.
4,Belkin Sports Armband,I really enjoy the armband. I use it to run and while I am on my bike.Great product.
2,Scaasi....,"Good Book, but Scaasi is a designer of yester year. I enjoyed some of the book, but only some... too dated."
3,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to Chase's story. In all the previous St. John novels, Hawkins hinted that something was wrong with this beloved brother and I was mightily intrigued. But the story just didn't deliver. Chase is being blackmailed by a man he once considered a friend and is forced to flee England so as not to tarnish the St. John name. Along the way he has an accident and is taken in by the Ward family where he pretends to have amnesia so word will not get round that he is there. He supposedly carries an incredible guilt with him over something that happened awhile ago when he was drunk, but you would not know it by his demeanor. He professes that it plagues him, but his actions do not show it. The whole thing seems rather contrived. Still, the Ward family is likeable and Hary Annesly is a dastardly villain indeed. An enjoyable read if a bit of a letdown."
5,Amazing!,"This is my favorite book by Karen Hawkins, though I love all her books. I couldn't put this one down, read it in one day!"
3,"Made the Grade: St. John Brothers / Talisman Ring Series, Book 3","3 out of 5 stars. It was a very cute story. More tamed then I would have liked but it still kept my interest, wanting to see where this sweet romance between Chase and Harriet would lead.Review By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and a few teasers on my blog)"
3,It's just OK,"This book is an interesting plotline and likeable characters brought down a notch by poor dialogue. I like when authors use the correct vernacular of the time period, but this book beats the reader about the head with it - if I never read another ""B'God"" or ""piffle"" again it will be just fine by me. ""An Affair to Remember"" is a better story all around."
4,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book very much, and thought it a good companion to the other Talisman Ring books. I disagree with the reviewer ""Disappointed""...Chase is being blackmailed by someone, and has been trying to cope with it for a year by drinking and avoiding those closest to him. The reader finds out that although he tried to make amends for his actions, he is ashamed of his behavior that caused an accident and that led to the blackmail. I thought his actions (drinking heavily, running away) in light of his history were highly plausible, and the author built up his story from previous books into this one well. His failure is in trusting the wrong person and not those truly closest to him. I enjoyed the author's depiction of the Ward family and Chase's interaction with them, and would recommend this book if you enjoyed Hawkins other books."
1,Worst product ever,I bought this item to hook a aftermarket CD player into my 95 Lincoln town on on of the connector work it was the one for power and the on for the speaker would fit I went to junk yard l were a 93 and a 97 town was and tired the speaker connector on the factory ones in the cars and still didn't fit by far the worst thing I have ever bought for carxtc
4,Review - To Our Children's Children's Children,"The remastering on this is quite good and does a lot to enhance the best Moody Blues album. However, the live BBC show on disc 2 is somewhat of a disappointment: There is a lot of tape flutter and the recording, even after being treated to 2006 cutting edge cleaning and mastering standards, still retains the sound of a 1969 tape recorder with dirty heads. I would recommend passing on this edition and getting a more affordable, single disc remaster."
2,MOODY'S SACD's NOT VERY GOOD,"I own quite a few SACD's and DVD Audio Discs. The Moody Blues have been a favorite of mine since 1970. I was pretty psyched when I heard about the ""Classic 7"" Moody Blues Albums being released in multi-channel SACD Format. I could not have been more disappointed in the sound quality of these discs. I think they sound great if you listen to them in an SACD Player in Stereo Mode but, the surround mixes are not very impressive, considering how great the SACD Format can sound. If you want to hear how an SACD Multi Channel CD should sound, pick up Honky Chateau by Elton John. Unbelievable !Most all of the Elton John SACD's sound magnificent. Dire Straits Brothers in Arms is another fantastic sounding SACD. Compare these discs to The Moody Blues SACD's and you might just toss the Moody Blues Discs."
2,Deluxe Editions too loud for regular CD players,"I am shocked when I keep seeing positive reviews of this edition of this album. If you like your music very boomy with very little detail and clarity in the highest and lowest frequencies, then this version is for you. However if you own a regular CD player, and want to hear all the various details that the group put into this fine album, then don't buy the ""deluxe edition"". The 1986 and 1997 masters are much finer sounding on regular CD players than this version. I can only assume that the glowing reviews were regarding the SACD layer, but that can't be enjoyed on regular CD players. I have purchased about 4 ""deluxe edition"" albums in the past 4 years, including 2 Who albums, 1 Cure album and 1 Stone Roses album, all are overly loud and compressed. I feel cheated for having purchased these, and I hope this review will help warn those that like a fine detailed listening experience like I do."
5,Best value,I purchased this credit card machine printer tape at a very good price and the quality was very good.
2,This book isn't very good for vegetarians!,"Although I like the idea of the diet in the book, and I've heard it really works well, for lacto-vegetarians like myself there are only 2 protein sources for every day - hard cheese and cottage cheese! No soy foods, no beans and no vegetarian protein entrees at all! How can I get ahold of the authors to modify this diet so that it will work for me?"
4,I got the recommendation from Dr. Weil,"If you follow this book, you can loose as much weight as you like. I lost more than 20 lbs. using this book."
1,the two day diet,The book was out of date and not current in content. It was a waste of my money. The diet does not follow current medical reccomendations. I would really like to return it.
1,Not accurate,"The information provided are not generalised and not addressed to specific Needs. i.e There is no information on how much protein or Carbohydrate pro Kg bodyweight is required. Only general Tables that do not differenciate among many factors. To me really sad, that the authors did not come to details..Thats why only one star..."
2,Kadaj,"kind of dissapointed with the overall quality, on top of being difficult to remove from the sheath, the blades are very wobbly and quite uneven..."
3,What I think,"I personally think that the sword is pretty cool, but just a few things that really bug me about it are that the blades aren't sturdy at all, one is slightly bent to the outside, and they both can wiggle back and forth and even touch eachother. And there is a little to much oil or whatever's on it, its gonna take me awhile to clean it all out. There are quite a few scratches along the blade also, a little to many than id hoped for, other than that though, its a very nice sword. The hilt wrappings are very solid and there aren't any scraps on the handguard or other designs on the hilt, and it also just feels great in your hands. I just wish the blades were solid."
5,Simply fantastic,"I am a 29 years-old violin musician. To be concise, you will never obtain so, so much for such a little price. Some of the works were originally written for Spanish guitar, and others exclusively for violin, as those from Sarasate, and the violin performance of all of them together is simply fantastic."
2,Abilene Musicological WL,"There are a few things which really stick out to me about this hymnal which Mr. McCann and Jack Boyd wrote. It is only available in large printed shape notes. This versus Howard's Songs of Faith and Praise is much cleaner and is put together much beter as far as this is concerned. With the Praise and Worship tradition that is occurring rapidly throughout the churches of Christ in the United States today, the hymns in this book which are put together for an apparent ""High Church"" crowd are becoming strikingly obsolete. Never the less it is great for teaching the musicological aspect of our great and rich Hymnody and is a must for every worship leader's library. It is a 2 1/2 stars."
4,h20 is the best,The first self titled album is still the best hardcore punk album i have ever heard i highly recomend it.
2,Is scale playing music?,This CD is basically a recording of scale playing with not much attentionto melody or feeling. It was a showcase of technical talents and becomesnerve wracking quickly. If you like scales you will love this.
3,Even a Great Guitarist Needs Some Help on Occasion,"I am a guitar player. I love to listen to guitar music. However, as you'll read in another of my reviews, I don't inherently love instrumental jazz to begin with.I thought these standards, while played with great technical virtuosity, would have been more interesting had Pass added some ""color"" to the tunes by alternating some solos with other instruments such as a piano and sax. Even though I'm a guitar player, I find songs done with a single tonal coloration and singular style to be boring. Imagine Miles Davis doing So What all the way through with only his trumpet...If you are a devoted jazz lover and/or a devoted lover of instrumental guitar, add a couple of stars. My guitarist friend loves him, but I can pass on Pass."
4,too much of a good thing,"I really enjoyed this cd...up to a point. I have been a guitar player for many years and can truly appreciate the skill that Joe Pass displays on this recording. The phrasing, subtlety and incredible ability are very evident here. As much as I enjoyed it though, I found myself thinking that unless you are a real guitar nut, you might find this style of unaccompanied guitar tiring. It reminded me of listening to Bach on the harpsichord. Beautiful but a little goes a long way."
4,True to the word 'virtuoso',"Joe Pass's album was so liked when it came out he went on to record a bunch of sequels. So how does 52 minutes of solo guitar stand up? Joe Pass tackles a program of standards - only ""Blues for Alican"" is an original. The standards he plays includes some warhorses -- ""Night And Day"", ""Stella By Starlight"", ""Cherokee"", ""Have You Met Miss Jones?"", and ""'Round Midnight"". The solo guitar version is sufficiently different enough from, say, Sonny Rollins' ""Night And Day"", you certainly won't be bored with having another version. The playing itself is a marvel. Pass swings through each song, his notes and clean and perfect, and since he's playing by himself, the differences between solos and verse/choruses are constantly blurred. The main reason I give the CD 4 stars instead of 5 is that the songs themselves blur together a little. ""How High The Moon"" and ""Have You Met Miss Jones?"" stand out the most to me, I'm sure everyone has different favorites. Very highly recommended."
5,Another Great F. Ross Holland book,"F.Ross Holland begins with a few world lights-of-old in drawings. From there the photography captures lighthouses from the British Isles to the U.S., including Alaska and Hawaii. Lights from Canada are here, as well as some from the Carribean. Many of the beautiful photos of today are accompanied by historical images. But this is not a mere picture book; there's plenty of stories and historical information. It's a great addition to any lighthouse lover's library!"
5,Consider your beats broken!,"Tal M. Klein is the DJ! He's a whole lot more, too--he's a professional breaker of beats, and he's put together a great batch o' beats this time out, as well as found sounds, funky bits, samples and grooves. His earlier work was already pretty darned good, but it was a warmup for this, which is tight, funky, without a beat wasted."
4,A Great Start,"This book has a lot of valuable information on the cyberpunk movement, and Gibson's critical contribution to the genre. A little more history of cyberpunk would have been welcome -- for example, the book briefly deals with cyberpunk's roots in Victorian Gothic and hard-boiled detective fiction without really going into much detail. This is nit-picky, I know, but a definitive book on the subject would deal with the movement's history.I'd also recommend Bruce Sterling's instrumental introduction to the cyberpunk anthology _Mirrorshades_, and _Storming_the_Reality_Studio if you're really too lazy to go out and actually read cyberpunk."
3,Too much pride?,"The first time I read this book was years ago. I recently re-read it and this time around I was not as impressed with it as the first time. It seems to me that there was very little or no love between the hero and heroine. Even when they revealed their love for each other it did not seem to be ""real."" The hero had a ""huge ego."" He was actually quite cruel to his wife. By gifting his ex-lover? with a beautiful opal he really hurt his wife. His explanation that it was because of his pride, did not seem to me to be a valid reason. That part was skimmed over and the heroine just accepted what he did. She needed to have more of a backbone to deal with an egotistical male."
5,~A variety that makes you say WOW!~,"One of the best things about this cd is that not just one artist is featured, but over 30! Thats alot, and it's fun to listen to. I have listened to it, and suddenly realized I found more great Christian artists! It is wonderful to listen to people worship with their God-given talents. Wow is for everyone. Those who like fast and slow moving songs, or those who are looking for something new and exciting! Happy listening!"
5,What an awesOme and Wonderful cd! WOW!,"I like many of the songs on this album! I have looked for these songs that were hits, but I didn't want to buy a whole bunch of CDs for just one song. This album has all of my favorites on it. The best songs (in my opinion) are: Consume Me, One of These Days, and Always and Forever. All of the songs, however, are awesome, so I recommend that you go out and buy this CD! You won't regret it!"
2,A very special delivery,It was a very good book. Harlequin needs to make more like them. I love reading these kind of books.
3,"Light and fluffy, needs more wine","A British man in a dead-end job in London gets fired and, on the same day, inherits a vineyard in Provence--that is the premise for this light novel. It was entertaining enough, but a trifle fluffy for my tastes I wish more of the narrative had been spent on wine and food, and less on silly conspiratorial plots and even sillier romances."
5,Cultural Feast,"This book certainly follows the pattern of A Year In Provence with an up-close and in-depth look at the rural culture of a town in Provence. The book, however, starts off in London where the life of the hero, Max, has just fallen apart. His friend, Charlie, helps him travel to the warmer, more exotic environs of southern Provence where the weather is temperate and the people somewhat strange and mysterious. He takes up residence in the house of his uncle which sits on a vineyard that produces a wine of horrific qualities. The story takes off from there into a tangled but fascinating whirlwind of romance, crime, boutique wineries, local culinary customs and some rather unique, local personalities. Mayle peppers the story with witticisms that add extra life to the story...a good read."
3,a good year,"Typical Mayle writing. A good book to take on a trip or to keep by one's bedside. Light weight, but fun."
3,A Good Year is a good read,"Peter Mayle, as always, offers a light, enjoyable read. He writes in such an easy, comfortable pace that one feels they are strolling through the little villages of Provence. His humor is as easy and relaxed as the blue sky and sunshine he conjures up. His novels do not pretend to be heavy, literary pieces - just a lazy afternoon in Provence."
4,Easy read,"Read this on the plane from Toronto to Vegas, a very easy read with pleasant characters. The plot was predictable and the author didnt try to confuse it as he could have and as others tend to do so. Happy to pass this on for others to read and put a smile on their faces."
1,Disappointed,"I found Peter Mayle's latest effort to be boring, predictable and rather juvenile. The Provence well seems to have finally dried up."
2,Pedestrian Provence,"Rather dull account of a man's transition from the corporate rat race of London to vineyard owner in Provence. The characters are all likable enough but I found the writing fell short, especially in the descriptions of the land and wine and food...all the things that make France so memorable.I am rather perplexed that such mediocre fare would interest Hollywood enough to translate this to a movie.A far better look at wine and the men who love it can be found in Sideways..both the book and the movie."
3,Mayle delivers the usual cast of characters,"The great thing about Peter Mayle novels, including this one, A Good Year, is that the author is reliable. He deliveres the usual cast of characters: the sleazy one, the snobbish one and the totally flummoxed protagonist trying to make some sense of his life. It's all light hearted fun. Nothing profound. Just a quick, breezy read, which is why ""A Good Year"" has had such predictable reviews. And why I enjoyed reading it again, the second time. Mayle has carved out his niche and knows how to keep his audience happy."
3,A fun way to soak up the Provencal life!,"Peter Mayle's latest novel is charming and light-hearted and makes for the perfect beach read! His witty prose and colorful characters surely capture the attention of the reader even though the plot is somewhat underdeveloped. The many facets of Provencal life, however, are as delectable as ever, which is likely why Mayle continues to captivate his readers. So pick up a copy of this pleasing little novel, pour yourself a spot of pastis, and indulge your senses in a little of that good Provencal living!"
4,A great airport page turner,"This book was a quick, fun read- I bought it in an airport bookstore and finished it by the end of the flight. It was a quick paced story with interesting twists and some nice tension- great for keeping your mind occupied on a plane, gives you a nice wrapped up feeling at the end, but not a terribly deep book. A great summer/beach read!"
3,A Moderate Year,"I have read all of Peter Mayle's books and this one must have been written in a hurry. The characters were not well drawn as in previous books. It was a pleasant story, but it did not give me the desire to travel to St-Pons, France."
2,sour grapes,"While still a lighthearted, fun read, this book disappoints on many levels. Too much focus on plot, not enough on the characters. Why hadn't Max seen his uncle in years? And was the California cousin really necessary? It would have been more interesting for Max to figure out the deception on his own. And the scant attention paid to the sting operation and the criminals' impluasibly quick exit left much to be desired. For a much better Mayle novel of this type, read Chasing Cezanne."
4,Good fluff,"I wasn't expecting to like this book, I admit. I say the title, I saw the cover, and figured it was another mainstream `Oprah-esque' book (I'm notorious for hating those - don't even talk to me about The Lovely Bones). But, it was a recommendation, and I had to give it a fair shot. And it was... good. The characters were wonderfully written and very enjoyable. The plot started off like a shot, then lagged a bit, but really picked up at the end. There was a hint of mystery, some action, and a flirtatious bit of romance. It suffers in its rating only for being a bit anti-American in spots, or at least my over-sensitive mind thought so... Still, a well-written good story of generic fiction, something anyone would enjoy."
1,A Bad Week,"That must have been what Mayle was going through when writing ""A Good Year."" I was looking for a light read, but this is pure shlock. It inspired too many moans of dismay at the predictable plot, the paper-thin characters, and the poor writing for it to be in any way entertaining. Mayle must have spent a whole seven days writing this. Don't waste your money."
3,"Pleasant enough, but ....","Once again Peter Mayle writes what he knows -- in this story a 30-something, burned-out, over-drafted London businessman inherits a winery in Provence, chucks the rat race and embraces a simpler life. Amusing complications arise, of course, but they're dealt with so easily they're hardly worthy of the term ""plot device"". It IS a very pleasant read, funny in spots, and our hero is charming, but it's also less than Mayle has delivered in the past. Bottomline: A quick, charming read without much oomph! to it, and certainly not worth buying in hardcover."
3,Off to the beach,"Put on your swimsuit, slather up with sunscreen, and don't forget the headphones! This audio version of A Good Year is the perfect beach companion. Light, amusing, well performed, and tres francais! Just the thing for relaxing on your sand chair. You might want to bring some wine as well, as these characters do all but swim in it! Not as good as A Year in Provence, but fun anyway."
2,Same character...different name.,"Repetitious character...bordering on unemployment, single, loves wine, ends up in Provence. Sluggish plot. What a disappointment."
3,Not the best introduction to Mayle's charm.,"I always thought this author had a sort of appeal best classified as ""charm."" Not really adventure, not highly literary, but certainly literate and enjoyable. Here he is a little flat: however, this little novel could provide a pleasant read in an airport or during a short trip. I might even think of it as a pool (but not a beach) book. It's a white Zanfandel to his previous big reds. If you liked his two south of France books, you will probably get a whiff of thyme and rosemary here, but not the full flood of aromas. After the Cabernet, do you really want Merlot? If you have not read the previous works, go there first, they were better vintages, and you can develop the taste.."
3,book and then MOVIE,"The book was entertaining and would have rated higher, in my opinion, if I had not already seen the movie. This was not what I expected. The movie had so many fascinating flashbacks and it all tied together so perfectly at the end. I'm glad they made the movie and I appreciate the book as the basis of a first rate movie. I give the movie 5+ stars."
3,A Good Book,"After seeing the movie, I wanted to read the book. Peter Mayle paints a beautiful picture of the Provence region of France. The book is very different from the movie and if you've seen the movie, you'll be surprised at how different it is. Max in the book is much more of a nice guy than Russell's Max. Definitely worth buying."
2,ok for what it is,"On vacation from thought-provoking novels? Want to laugh and smile without having to think too much? Want a book you can breeze through in a few hours at the most? ...then this book is for you. It wasn't my taste though, to explain the low rating. This was my first and last Mayle book. I consider it a waste when I've read through a book and realized that the author had nothing to say."
5,Book on CD,"I am a big fan of Peter Mayle and in addition just last week returned from a trip to France. I listened to the book on CD during a car trip from NJ to Boston (about 5 1/2 hours each way). I was caught in a traffic jam on the return but spent the time listening to this delightful tale. I also travel frequently to Napa Valley in California, mentioned so often in the story. It was a light and pleasant story filled with interesting wine facts. I would recommend it."
3,A Good Year,"I bough this book because I had recently watched the DVD, it wasn't quite the same as the movie, but still a good read."
3,Movie Verses Book,"After seeing the movie, I thought I would enjoy reading the book, but it was not as good as the movie! Russell Crowe broke out of his serious roles for this comedy and succeeded."
3,Easy reading,This is a fun and light story that makes for excellent beach reading. It also reads fast and doesn't weigh one down.
4,Anecdotal intrigue,"After having read and enjoyed Peter Mayle's first book I wasn't disappointed with his affection for Provence and its people in this romp through the vineyards. As usual in my experience after the novel the film misses the finer detail and depth of character that Peter Mayle seems to effortlessly reach in this fine story of anecdotes and information about customs, the wine industry and the humorous rivalry between the British and the French."
1,Don't waste your money,"Walter Coddington obviously knows very little about the business world. Another case of someone who does not know real world but tries to be a self proclaimed expert in something. He likes to drop names and list sources but the man lacks any sort of charisma or business sense. This is an obvious attempt to publish something just to use it as another reference for himself, there is no useful information in this text that is not common sense. There are much better sources on the subject if you make any effort to look, probably the same ones Mr. Coddington used I'm sure."
2,Not a good book if you are already in the industry,SO if you are trying to get in pharma then I think this is a great book at preparing you for the interview process and what to expect. I thought it was going to motivate me to be a better pharma rep and it was terrible because it only told me everything I already know since I am in pharma sales. But it is well written and I would say totally read it if you are trying to get into pharma.
4,Be Brief. Be Bright. Be Gone.: Career Essentials for Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Sales Representatives,"Was recommended to me from a past co-worker-now a pharma rep. Great overview and way to brush up prior to interviewing. Fairly general, however still a good read."
2,Hitch Grip towable,"Bought this to use on our camper hitch and it didn't fit. We have a weight distributing hitch and it's just a little thicker (still 2"" but rounded edges) than a typical 2"" hitch. The bikes also wouldn't have cleared the propane tanks on camper hitch while turning corners. Looked like a good idea, but think this probably wouldn't work for any camper-- only longer tongued towables like small boats or trailers, and then it'd probably be just as easy to put bikes inside trailer or boat. I was able to return it without a problem, so only lost shipping cost each way -around $20. Live and learn."
5,great bike hitch if you are towing something else,We are towing a trailer around the country and needed a bike rack. This works perfectly.
3,hitch grip trailer towning hitch receiver bike rack,"It works, but really tough to get bikes past first holder or two. Really a two-personjob. Received in a timely manner from Amazon."
5,Life Lessons,I did read a fair amount of this book and I reallly enjoyed it. I need to read more as it is very good reading
5,Clarissa Explains It All,"Clarissa Explains It All ""Ferguson Explains It All"" VHSClarissa Explains It All Season 1 DVDClarissa Explains It All ""Boys"" Book"
1,Claw My Eyes Out,"This sucker stinks. Bad. It really never should've been made. Period. I like Sid Haig, but come on. Nobody is even trying to make this good. What's the point? Save your money."
1,Just plain bad,"To say this movie sucks would be a understatement. I gave the movie one star simply for Sid Haig. But not even he could save this stinker of a movie. Terrible acting, horrible editing and agonizingly bad 3D combine to put this movie at the very top of my list of all time worst movie. Please don't waste good money on this bad movie."
1,Sid Haig deserves better,"If you know absolutely nothing about this flick, let it be known now that Night of the Living Dead 3-D has nothing in common whatsoever with George Romero's all time classic of the same name. This is not the classic zombie movie that started it all in 3-D (you can more than likely figure that out just by looking at the cover of the DVD case), but rather an ultra low-budget, terrible zombie movie that just so happens to bear the same name. Cult actor favorite Sid ""Captain Spaulding"" Haig stars here, and he certainly deserves better than having to be in this. The zombie makeup is horrid, there is virtually no blood to be found, and the film as a whole just comes off as one big joke that no one is laughing at. It isn't even so bad it's funny either, it's just plain awful. The fact that it's in 3-D may coax some cackles, but even the 3-D glasses are just plain lame. Avoid."
3,"Sid helps, a lot","First - not a fan of the red lens/blue lens way of going 3D, for a color film....such an eye strain and even worse, in color. Really needs monochromatic black and white in stark contrast...even then, it is an iffy thing. You can get this in the 2D version and skip that problem - but on to the film. Forget you ever watch a Romero film before, take this as a little film on its own, and you might enjoy it more. Problem is when they do make ups for the red/blue 3D factor; they are not good makeup's....really shows. I liked it and have watched it several times on the strength of the character actors, the humor, and Haig always is a person I enjoy ---even with iffy dialogue. For just an extra film to pop in now and then, I liked it in that regard and suggest a rental, then if you like it and the price is right, you might want to add to your collection."
4,Much better than the reviews indicate,"It's a B movie. It's 3D (if you buy the 3D version). It's based off a story most people know almost by heart.It has decent, non-CGI effects. It is fun. It does a homage to NoTLD but is original in many ways, even the zombie portions. It is not a copy, but that is good!I had seen this before and not thought a whole lot about it (a few years ago). Now, re watching it I find that it is not too bad, actually much better than I remembered. I even ordered the 3D version on DVD. Near the end it reminded me of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (intentional? I don't know). If you are a fan of the zombie genre you should give this one a chance (of course, realizing it is a B movie (like the original NoTLD). Recommended."
2,3D not ready for Home TV Screens,"Obviously, the seller is not accountable for a technology that doesn't seem able to improve on the look of the Fifties. Actually, this film was not nearly as good as some I saw at theaters in the Fifties.The film did arrive in a timely manner and was in New condition. Sorry for late submission of feedback."
3,Good 3-D effects,"Enough has been said about the quality (or lack thereof) of this ""remake"" of George Romero's classic (which surprised and chilled me in its original theatrical release). For my part, I've seen worse. What's worth talking about is the quality of the 3D in this particular entry. It's far superior to anything I've seen offered on DVD so far. I have always LOVED 3D! So much so that I endured ""Spy Kids 3D"" and ""Comin' At Ya!"" which should give you some idea of my desperate, nostalgic passion for the technology. Those efforts left much to be desired, suffering color quality loss and often only marginal effectiveness. Not so with this one. The visual effect is consistent and the color doesn't mutate. In short, if you're NOT into 3D, give this movie a pass. But if you're an addict like me, give it a try."
1,no way,"im lucky cause the dvd in my hand right now was given to me free.Look at the back of this dvd, in small print : THIS IS A NEW MOTION PICTURE FILMED IN 3-D THAT IS RE-IMAGINNING OF THE 1968 PUBLIC DOMAIN MOTION PICTURE `NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD`.GEORGES A.ROMERO IS NOT AFFILIATED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS NEW FILM......do i have to say more !!"
5,AWESOME,Well I have nothing bad to say about my recent order. The DVD is in great condition and I love that it came with the 3D glasses and the order arrived alot sooner than expected.
3,Not that bad,"Okay ... Understand what you're getting into with this movie and set your expectations accordingly. This is a low budget, short, zombie movie with plot holes, and many young actors. This is NOT a Rob Zombie remake of the original Romero movie. Your opinion of the film will be based on your expectations.I am a big fan of zombie movies and a fan of 3D movies so I had no choice but to buy this movie. (Didn't even know I could have 3D at home). The 3D was pretty interesting and enjoyable on my 96 inch projector. It wasn't as amazing as The Nightmare Before Christmas in Disney 3D that I had just seen ... but good for home and it enhanced my experience and enjoyment of the movie.The acting in the movie is not great, although Sid Haig does stand out and shows why his picture is on the cover. Since the movie is loosely based on the original NOTLD, it is predictable. However, all in all, the movie was worthwhile in 3D. I doubt my impression would be as favorable in 2D."
3,It's OK.,"This movie is ok, don't expect anything great. Average straight to dvd horror movie. I guess it was in 3d in the two theaters it played in, but its 2d on the disc."
1,3-D but only just...,"I started watching the film with great expectations but was soon disappointed, the 3-D effects were weak and the picture fuzzy. The glasses supplied with the DVD were scratched and cheap so I used my own. I have been interested in stereoscopic phototography and movies for many years so know what is possible. In short a poor effort and in my opinion not worth buying."
2,Night of the Sell out,"This movie was bad. The acting was bad, the story was bad, the memories are bad. When this flick came out I raced to the store to pick it up, ran home and popped it in the dvd player only to turn it off 30 minutes in. I decided doing homework would be a better way to pass the time. Poor, Poor Sid Haig, this was an obvious selling out for him. He must've noticed the movie was going to be awful too and put forth zero effort into his character and trust me it shows. Old Dawn vs. New Dawn are both excellent films but when comparing Old Night vs. New Night, its like Mike Tyson fighting an infant."
3,not 3d showing,when i saw this movie in my tv i was so happy to see it but when i put on my 3d glasses i was disappointed cause there wasn`t nothing that was in that movie i`m saying two thing that was in 3d the shovel and the cigar that was 3d but the glasses didnt help to showw the effect that why i gave 3 star but the movie was very good they should have left it alone i also love the zombie they were great
1,I Wish I Could Give This Movie Less Than 1!,"Don't buy this movie. Don't rent this movie. Don't watch it if it is on cable. Keep yourself very far away from this movie. The acting is horrible. The SFX are less than C grade. The 3D effects are absolutely horrible. I remember having to take off my 3D glasses to see if the film was supposed to be in black and white, but it was shot in color. The story is just ridiculous. I felt bad for George Romero since they would always try and throw the original movie in the background reminding us this was supposed to be I guess kind of a tribute to that film. I wish I could say that this was a bad, fun movie but it isn't even that."
1,This is an insult to George A. Romero!!!!,This movie was soooooooo STUPID!!!!!!! Avoid watching or buying this movie. A true DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!! This movies ranks right up with Day of the Dead 2: Contiguma. This movie makes House of the Dead way BETTER!!!
3,3D was great,"The movie itself was poor. I would only give it two stars. The acting was really bad, and the dialogue is laughable. Even Sid Haigs performance is pretty bad. Now the thing that makes this worth buying is if you are a big 3D fan like me. Compared to the other red and blue glasses 3D movies I have seen, this one is the best. Maybe having a LCD tv playing it on a bluray player helped, but I couldnt get over how awesome it looked. Now its not as awesome as IMAX 3d with shutter glasses or 3D you would see at Disney, but it was pretty awesome. So if you are watching this for the 3d its worth it, but if you are watching this in 2d looking for a good movie, definetly look elsewhere."
3,Get it for free on his website?!,"This book is great. It will tell you basically everything you need to know about the weight game.It will also (hopefully) help to dispel the myth of the musclemags for most new trainees.However, the author gives away most of the information free on his website!I read everything on his website in order to decide whether the book was worth buying. Based on the website, it is!!Upon receiving the book I saw that not only was it not much different from the website - it actually was the website, word for word!"
2,Why buy a book?,"That is a verbatim copy of a website? I purchased the book because I found the website informative but the book is a some-what abbreviated version of the website. One does not need to pay [money] for a poorly-written 90 page book when all the information is available on the website. I don't care how motivational some people think the book is, they should get the same motivation from the website. ALL the information and workouts in the 'book' are available for free on numerous natural websites.I returned mine the same day. The author accuses the industry of being greedy and wanting our money. I find this ""book"" to be more of the same. Especially when the author has no real credentials. A person that eschues steroids but quotes Swartzeneger?"
4,GOOD BOOK...ENJOYABLE STYLE!!!,"In my naivete I used to perform those five-to-six-days-a-week workouts and 15 to 20 sets per bodypart in the magazines with nothing more than frequent colds and sickness and loss of strength. After reading ALPHA MALE I tried the abbreviated hard-core basic-exercise workouts, doing no more than three-days-a-week workouts. My gains have come at a stellar pace from following the outlined workouts and basic nutrition in this great book in a much shorter time. Mr. Delucia's straightforward style and honesty makes an interesting read. The supplement companies hold a monopoly which Delucia busts through all the hype and tells it like it is."
3,Great info but save your cash and visit the website....,"The information in this book is essential for any beginning bodybuilder. The straight facts and motivational tidbits aid the reader to return from the land of ""unattainable goals"". The book delivers the basics on what you need to build mass without the bull. Bottom line: Save 20 bucks and check the website for the same information. I had visited prior to the book purchase and was disappoint to read most of the same word for word info in the book."
1,Not what I expected,"I was hyped over this book since I got an autographed copy, but it turned out to be just a bunch of nonsense. The author has no credentials. Who is this guy anyway? in his pictures he looks just like a average Joe with no muscle whatsoever. i can tell he doesn't use supplements. He talks trash about proffesional bodybuilders, and then goes and mentiones quotes from them. The worst part is that I learned absolutely nothing.not worth the money, you can buy "" Body for Life"" and learn 1o times as much."
5,An In-Depth Account of Kahlo's Private Life,"Tired of reading all the Kahlo biographies full of facts in a ""documentary style"" format..? Then this book is for you. This Kahlo biography, with a splash of Mexican history, presents an in-depth look at the private life of this famous Mexican painter in the style of a novel. This book is written for young adult readers and is very well written, well organized, easy reading and full of tidbits of information not found in other books. Once you start to read it you can't put it down. When you're finished you will know and understand the real Frida Kahlo. Highly recommend this book to readers of all ages.If you are looking for information on her paintings you won't find it here. Not much is said about her paintings and there are only 6 small color and 3 black & white illustrations of her paintings and 6 black & white photos. In the back of the book there is a very brief chronology."
3,Childlike and Innocent,"Not as strong as the other recordings in Hancock's Blue Notecatalog though. Some of the music is arranged for an 8 or 9 pieceband, and some is stripped down to trio form. None of it blows me away though. The title track is a nice modal piece but not quite as impressive as ""Dolphin Dance"" from the previous album, which it resembles."
2,Overrated,"This session is usually spoken about in the same breath as ""Maiden Voyage"" and ""Empyrean Isles"". Both of those are superior to this 1968 recording, which I found dated, muddy, chaotic in spots and formless. ""Speak Like A Child"" is particularly dated---like a bad love theme from a late 1960s B-movie. Herbie Hancock has done better than this."
3,awful lot of distortion,"... especially in the alternate take of ""goodbye to childhood"". sounds like tape noise & dropout. at first i thought something failed when i'd ripped this to itunes so i tried the cd directly. it's in the disc.sure marred an otherwise fine performance."
4,Let's not get carried away.,"This jazz is very pleasing. But the review below mine is misleading (as far as I'm concerned). Certainly not essential jazz, but worthwhile nevertheless."
2,Not a big fan,I'm in my twenties and just getting started on my anti aging regimen. I used this for a month or so and didn't really see or feel any results. I don't think it went well with my skin either. I switched to St. Ives moisturizer with collagen and I like it a lot better.
1,Not enough time to cancel order,"I think the price is great with the 15% off, I buy this product all the time and never have found it for less than $17.00; however, I am not happy that I signed up for the program and immediately was shipped the item, rather than allow me to order it when I am ready. But mostly I am irritated that when I went back to delete the order, till I was in need of the product, I am unable to cancel it. Within about 30 minutes or less (I'm being generous with the time frame) they are in the process of ""putting the order together and can't cancel at this time"" I think that's ridiculous. So don't sign up for the program if you don't need the product immediately."
5,I love it!,This is a fabulous moisturizer. I absolutely love it and would repurchase. I put it on before my foundation and let set for a few minutes before applying.
5,great moisturizer,I've used this product for years. I love how soft it leaves my skin and it's not greasy. I like how my makeup goes on smoothly after applying the Olay.
3,Not good for acne prone skine,I tried this product for about 3 months and my acne became worse. It's a great moisturizer if you have dry skin. I do not recommend it for acne/oily skin.
3,Do not use if you have acne prone skin!!!,"I have been a loyal Olay customer for years and use their daily lotion for oily skin and cleansing cloths. I have very acne prone skin and I must be very careful with what I put on my skin. Anything that contains oil is off limits. Moisturizers are therefore very problematic, but as I am getting older I need them, while I am still getting break-outs. As Olay is known for their oil free products and their SPF lotion never caused any problems, I decided to give this a try. Big mistake, I broke out immediately. However, for people who have regular skin, I am sure this can be a great product. Olay has great and affordable products, and it is unfortunate I cannot use all of them. But if you break out easily I would avoid this moisturizer, it too creamy."
3,Product okay,I prefer the regenerist product. It seems creamier. This is okay but I will use something else next time I order
4,very hydrating and long lasting effect,"I am applying it before going to bed when using air conditioner as it makes my skin dry but since i used this product, my sking is really hydrated till morning and fine lines are reducing though at a small pace but yes it works well!"
4,Charming,An enjoyable read. I own these books and remember how much I looked forward to each installment.
3,Panasonic Vacuum Belts Okay,"These belts are just simply ""okay"" Very hard to get on. Hard to locate in stores. Seems they don't last too long on the sweeper. Burn up easily."
3,An honest account of the challenges of sailing in the southern oceans,"Firstly - my disclaimer - I am not brave enough to have sailed in the Southern Ocean! I did enjoy Raud's story although it is a blend of 2 stories, one about his personal challenges and rock climbing, and the other about sailing in the Southern Ocean. I did manage to enjoy the rock climbing sections only because of the memories it brought back to me, not of climbing myself but of the many adventurous friends I had that were immersed in the sport at one stage. Again, it may have helped that I am Australian too.If you are obsessed with circumnavigation or stories of the Southern Ocean then you will enjoy this story. If you empathise with the challenges that life brings you, and need some inspiration for how to overcome them, then this book is for you too."
4,Just what the teacher ordered.,"This book was required for completing my online Shaping America U.S. History to 1877 class. I bought a used copy in like new condition to save some money. Each lesson and associated exams required us to frequently jump around the chapters to get the full picture of a person's life or event. I never had a real interest in history and found the text to be dry and difficult to read in the required four weeks. This is more about my lack of interest and less about the writing style though. I did notice that the cover is made from cheap paper which easily curls from normal use.PROS:Required for my online history classInformative detailed chaptersCONS:Cover is made from cheap paper which easily curlsToo darn expensive, as text books tend to be"
3,I liked how easy this product was to ...,"I liked how easy this product was to use. However, I'm not sure about the color. I am now very blonde -- almost too blonde. I think I'd use this product again but I'd choose a different color."
5,Although the color was a bit lighter than ...,Although the color was a bit lighter than I usually use -- I LOVE it. It left my hair feeling very soft and manageable. I've had many compliments on the color. My husband even took me to my favorite restaurant for dinner the night I colored it. This color makes me feel 10 years younger.
4,Good,"It's a good product for what it's made to do. It lasted a long time, even when I didn't use my color stay shampoo."
3,"Johnson/Evinrude Outboards, All V Engines, 1992-01 by Seloc Publications","The book describes the motor systems well. Obviusly written with the beginner in mind. Evin if you don't plan to do the repairs yourself, its a good book to browse through so you know your not getting ripped off at the dealer. Or, you may better understand problems at sea in emergencies."
4,Johnson Outboard Motor Repair Manual,Book was very informative to include pictures and step-by-step instructions. Saved me time and $$$ ; I avoided taking my outboard motor to a dealer.
3,Stunningly Nominal,"First I was drawn in by the hypnotic last track (the only one with lyrics). Then I was intrigued by the name. And when I read the concept behind the album, I became obsessed with hearing it. But I was amazed that such a startling non-traditional idea could yield such a traditional work. I had read one review that dismissed previous critics' characterization of Johannsson's music as ""filmic."" The reviewer believed this was because modern listeners only relate to instrumental music as film scores. But that is hardly the case here. This DOES sound like a score in search of a film. As an evocative backdrop it might have been gorgeous. As a work of art it is disappointingly predictable."
1,Small soldiers,"Was unable to view the movie. It was mailed in from ?Italy? And could not be played in the US. Kept stating ""wrong region""."
1,Didnt work for me!,"I was looking for an alternative to the mineral salts roll on deodorant that I normally use. This had some good reviews on other websites about being natural and keeping people dry. However, this only worked for about the first 4 hours then the stink set in. I usually don't stink with the mineral salts but I just sweat a lot. With this I sweat a lot and stink. Would not buy again."
2,Not long lasting,"I decided to go with this product based on the positive feedback left by Drew. Upon receiving the package, I could tell the deodorant had very robust scent, which I'm all in favor of and was exactly what I was aiming for. However, after applying the deodorant, the aroma simply does not last long at all. I'm not a very heavy sweater but since switching brands, I can smell a slight hint of body odor. I have no intentions on buying anything Nature De France-related again. $8 is quite expensive also."
1,doesn't work,"this product doesn't work. i stank up to high heaven within a few hours. save yourself the money, get something that works."
3,A Bad Rip-Off,"I read ""Cloud of Sparrows"" and the plot, in many ways, parallels the book, ""The Golden Crane"", which is also for sale on Amazon.com. The ""Golden Crane"" was copyrighted in 1997, well ahead of Matsuoka; but I find his take-off not as good. His addition of a hardened American gunfighter seems outrageous at best, and completely improbable in tightly controlled Japan. He makes the Japanese protagonist, Lord Genji, a psychotic visionary. This is also highly improbable in a society that reviles anyone different. In mid-nineteenth century Japan, Genji would have probably been killed before he reached adulthood, once his pyschosis became manifest. Matsuoka's work does offer more gratuitious gore, if you are in to gratuitous gore.However, if you want to read a better story, with many of the same elements, set in the same time period, and with a much more interesting plot, try the ""Golden Crane"", which is for sale as a less expensive paperback book."
2,cliched with occasional charm,"Although I very much wanted to like ""Cloud of Sparrows,"" I found much of it to be cliched and one-dimensional. There were occasional spots of charm, and I liked the super-samurai uncle as well as a few other side characters. Personally I much prefer ""Across the Nightingale Floor,"" which I found more nuanced and original."
3,Average Writing,"In my opinion, the book is not quite as bad nor as good as some readers are saying. I'd say Matsuoka has the potential to become a decent midlist writer. He'll never write a bestseller, because his writing style isn't that good and he is overly obsessed with violence for the sake of violence. Also quite frankly there hasn't been a bestseller in this genre since Clavell. Shogun set the standard. No one else has even come close to meeting it since then. A pity James Clavell passed away some years ago. I think he had a few more great novels left in him."
3,Mediocre,"I hate to pan a first time novelist, but when I plunk down my hard-earned cash, I expect quality work. I didn't get it with T. Matsuoka's ""Cloud of Sparrows"". The plot was terrible and totally unbelievable. The addition of the American gunfighter was not only ludicruous but historically inaccurate by at least twenty years. As a student of both Japanese and American history and culture, it surprised me that this novel was so full of cultural malapropisms. Where was the editor? He might have saved this book, if he had any knowledge himself. Then again maybe he didn't and that's why the novel isn't that good. Better luck next time. I sure won't be taken in again."
2,Pathetic,"I read this much ballyhooed first-time novel with anticipation. Unfortunately, I was let down on a number of levels. The writing was not that good, the plot was wacky, and the characters were poorly developed. All this might be forgiveable for someone in a college-level creative writing class, but a book by a major publisher? Well, that's just incredible! It really made me wonder how publisher's decide who gets published. It also made me question the wisdom of their editors and review boards. However, I will be more discerning next time. I won't be take in by the marketing hype."
2,Poor Writing,"I struggled to get through this apparently strange spin-off of Clavell's novel, ""Gai-Jin"". The author cobbled together some bizarre plot elements, but he fails to connect the dots. Plus his prose is awful. He definitely needs a good editor. The story takes place in Japan in 1860, and spans a little over a year. I could believe the missionary, but the gunfighter was preposterous. The characters were in general cardboard caricatures. The author seemed to concentrate more on bloody action than character development. I cannot recommend this book to anyone."
5,Unique and Unforgettable,"Written with a light touch and a great deal of grace, the story takes place in a feudal Japan of 1860. In addition to all the battles of honor and reputation within Japan, however, there is a new threat posed by The Outsiders. Amidst these intrigues, American missionaries Emily, Matthew and Zephaniah are hosted by Genji, the last lord of the Okanashi clan, reknowned for their great gifts of prophecy and foresight.Takashi Matsuoka&#65533;s Cloud of Sparrows is unique and unforgettable: in fact, I don&#65533;t think I&#65533;ve ever read anything quite like it. Matsuoka provides genuine insight into feudal Japanese culture and more importantly, allows us to see our own culture through the eyes of others. The Americans are very much The Outsiders in this novel, and their actions become almost as foreign to the reader as they are to the Japanese. A wonderful read."
3,"Good read, but the village scene blew it for me.","I enjoyed most of this novel. There's much to like. The action and characters drive the story. A page-turner with the usual first-novel flaws. But I was disgusted when the sympathetic protagonist commits a heinous, cruel act near the book's end. The redemption of another character, an American who committed a similar atrocity, didn't balance this isolated instance of premeditated evil on the part of the main character, who then goes on engage in a new romance without remorse. It would have been easier to swallow with some foreshadowing -- perhaps some sign that this character was being corrupted or had a dark, irrational side. I so wanted to love this book, but I felt annoyed and disappointed at the end."
2,A disappointment,"Unfortunately, I fell for the Delacorte hype and plunked down my hard-earned cash for this hugely disappointing book. I was expecting another shogun, and instead got a weirdo cross between a Louis L'Amour Western and a second-rate Liam Hearn novel. The plot was bad enough, but the writing was atrocious. I literally could not finish the book. It was that bad. And why do so many modern authors, like Matsuoka, have to saturate us with blood and mayhem?This is the last time I fall for book marketing hype."
3,A jr. version of Clavell's Shogun,"I expected a story as in depth and detailed as Shogun by James Clavell (altho his story had some flaws, too). Cloud of Sparrows is less in almost every respect. Less details, less story, less character development. Most importantly, Cloud of Sparrows does not have that core value which makes a novel great. At most, it stresses the inevitablitiy of things to come. Perhaps its a personal preference, but I rather enjoyed the vision of man's potential for limitless ambition, suberfuge, adventure, and love that was contained within Shogun."
2,No Shogun,"It's hard for me to imagine anyone other than a Delacorte marketing executive comparing Cloud of Sparrows to Shogun. While Cloud of Sparrows has a decent plot, the writing is fairly bland, the characters shallow, and the dialogue forced. I lived in Japan for three years, and as much as I wanted to love this book, I quit at page 250. On the other hand, I've read Shogun twice."
4,Intruiging story in mid 1800's Japan,"I thoroughly enjoyed this Shogun-like novel, set in mid 1800's Japan. Once I got the characters squared away, the story of the three missionaries, meeting with Lord Genji and Lady Heiko, was entertaining and fun.I will caution any reader on a Shogun comparison. There isn't nearly as much plot as in the Clavell novels. The story is kind of slim, as feudal Japan is beginning to move again into civil war, just when the Western powers are attacking. But although not as intricate as Shogun, it is a story very well told and engaging. I liked it a lot.The Kindle formatting and writing were excellent. I don't think this is a translated book. I am going to start the sequel Autumn Bridge right away."
3,"Good first novel, marred by unnecessary extremity","Matsuoka is capable of subtlety, rare in a beginning novelist, and I hope he develops that talent in the future and no longer feels he needs to rely on exaggerated characters motivated by exaggeratedly violent and abusive pasts. The plot is decent enough and although I don't know enough about the history or about Japanese culture to comment on the accuracy of the either characterization, both seemed handled well. I appreciated the Zen touches."
3,Quentin Tarantino's next film?,"Interesting mixture of sword-wielding, honor-bound samurais and gun-toting, code of the American West cowboys. The first of the book is low on action as everyone's story (and believe me everyone in this book has a story) is established. Then the action kicks into gear and the rest of the book is nothing but blood, blood, blood! Beheadings, dismemberments, evisceration, patricide, infanticide, and (lest we forget the cowboys) gunshot wounds. Buckets and buckets of blood in all its gory details. Once the story gets going it keeps a good pace and it did hold my interest all the way through."
3,"Clearly a First, But Not Bad","As stated in previous posts about this book, this is the author's first novel. This is clear in some of his writing where the flow is broken, or his continued use of certain phrases or ideas almost word-for-word. However, the book certainly does create an interesting view - I specifically enjoyed his descriptions of the interactions between Western and Eastern cultures. He also creates interesting, though violent, fight scenes. However, towards the end of the book he makes a HUGE break in character for the main character. While it fits with the culture, it does not fit with the gentle, level-headed character he had crafted. It will be interesting to see him grow as an author, as this book was at the very least a promising beginning."
1,Too stereotypical and bloody,"I forced myself to read it, and I don't think the book's that good. Here are some of the problems: prose is difficult to read, not straightforward; too many Japanese and western stereotypes; too bloody (why massacre a whole village of Eta? Samurai were honorable, not genocidal);historically inaccurate (era of wild west gunfighters was 1880s, not 1860); and there were just too many preposterous contrived plot devices (for example, Genji is psychic and sees the future). It seems the author had a good story buried in there somewhere. It's just too bad he had to hide it under all the b.s. and gore. Also, I'd expect much more honesty and a plot with a moral center from a former buddhist monk. Not this hyped garbage."
2,Clavell Rip-Off,"I read this book after Gai-Jin by James Clavell. It appears to be a rip-off of that novel. Plus the writing is worse, the plot is asinine, and it's way too gory for most people's tastes. Clavell was the master of this genre. No one else even comes close."
2,Second Rate Pablum,"After buying this novel, I read to page 124 then tossed it in the trash where it belongs. ""Cloud of Sparrows"" has no bearing or relevance on Japanese culture or history. All it is a gross caricature of samurai violence. But what I found most disturbing was that a major publisher was taken in. Well, I think I might try my hand at this game. I know nothing about the history of Russia, but I think I'll change my name to a Russian one, write an historical action adventure set in Russia and submit it to Random House. Heck, they'll publish it, just because I'll use a Russian last name."
2,Pathological,"I was deeply repelled by this work. On the surface, it appeared to be a Clavell clone. However, once I got past the first thirty pages, I realized that it was written by a sadistic psychopath...just one bload-soaked scene after another with no rhyme or reason for most of the bloodshed. At least Clavell's violence had purpose. Additionally, the book is historically inaccurate. However, since our culture is so dumbed-down few will notice that; but most will notice the unending gore. Was Matsuoka off his meds when he wrote this garbage? I wonder. Even more disturbing was that a major publisher actually printed it."
2,Ignorant and savage,This blood-soaked attempt at historical fiction stopped me cold in my tracks. Only a psychotic sociopath could enjoy this work. But what truly amazes me is that it somehow slipped past the screening process of one of the major publishers. How did that happen? Whoever was responsible should be taken to task. I wouldn't even recommend this book to Charles Manson. What a loser!
2,Horribly gruesome and disgusting!,"I enjoyed Shogun and Gai-Jin by Clavell, so I thought I'd give ""Cloud of Sparrows"" a try. I have never been so disappointed in a novel in my life. The plot seems to be a mere convenience for hundreds of pages of bloodshed and gore. Sadists will enjoy this book. Normal people will be repelled. Don't be fooled into buying this unmitigated trash."
4,"""As Flowing as a Sword's Blade""!","Besides the gripping, surprising, and flowing writing of Takashi Matsuoka, there is also what is to be learned from this novel. Ancient Japanese customs, and just as much of the form of thought at the time and place, is embedded in the pages, and also many sayings and interesting references. It makes you want to buy the second book halfway through the first, and is very hard to put down (but almost as hard to read in one sitting, I imagine). I recommend this book to anyone interested in detail and accepting and/or interested in foreign thought"
3,It's worth reading... but,"I enjoyed the raw history in ""Shogun"" and ""Gai-Jin."" I'm only half way through ""Cloud of Sparrows,"" but disappointed in several historical inaccuracies. Stark, the gunslinger, seems much more of an 1880s model than pre-1861. And years before his arrival in Japan, he joined the less-famous Arizona Rangers. Are these the same Arizona Rangers organized in 1901? Well, I'm enjoying the book, anyway. It's got action, intrigue, excitement -- and is the first book in I-don't-know-how-many that doesn't dwelled on the sex scenes."
3,Light as air,"This is a first novel that reads like a treatment for a TV mini-series. That's not to say it that it is not be a fun and entertaining read. However, many seem to be comparing or marketing this book as a new ""Shogun"". Well to paraphrase someone else, I have read Shogun (even saw the mini-series) and this is not Shogun. But given that as I read it on the beach in Maui I found it to be a fun and entertaining beach read. And yes producers, let's make this into a mini-series, I think it would be great fun."
5,I liked this a lot!,"1) Ron Rifkin reads the audiobook version of this book and did a fine job. Even without doing distinct voices for the characters I never had to guess or rewind to know which character was talking.2) There was a point during the audio presentation that I actually started to get teary-eyed becasue I was so sucked into the scene. The building of the scene and the sense of honor was simply overwhelming and inspiring.3) This story had a little bit of everything...history, action, romance, political intrigue, etc. A little something for everyone.4) The plot had fine twists and turns and I never really knew what to expect. In the end I personally was satisfied with the resolution of the story.5) Some very memorable characters who are driven by believable motivations.6) I've never read Shogun nor any other story like this, I just happened to stumble upon it and am very pleased I did. I'm encouraged to check out other similar type stories...Shogun being one of them."
2,Non stop bloodletting,"I am a great fan of historical fiction set in Japan and China, and have read many excellent books of that type. This one is a disappointment. It is one violent scene after another, with a body count that must be measured in the thousands. The ""heroes"" -- to use the term loosely -- are all coldhearted murderers. One's culture doesn't change that fact. Are we to admire them? Like them? Understand them? I could not, and therefore was left with reading about people who merely went from one bloody scene to another.The book is sadly lacking in real insights into the Japanese culture of that age -- there is far more depth to it than mere barbaric Samurai blood thirst. If the author's intention was to show us how horrid Japan was at that time, he succeeded. But if the book had been written by a Westerner, the author would have been called a racist for such a one-sided depiction of Japanese culture and life.All in all, not a book I can recommend."
2,Not Very Good,"I wanted to like this first novel by T. Matsuoka. Unfortunately, I couldn't. The writing was bad, the plot was strange, and the characters were like wooden japanese puppets. The hype surrounding this new novel did not deliver. I wondered to myself if Random House invested in a pig in a poke, and then realizing that it had went all out to get people to read it. But the truth is in the sales. As I write this review, Cloud of Sparrows is somewhere in the high forty thousand range on Amazon. That says a lot about the quality of the book. I'm sorry for Mr. Matsuoka, but he needs to do better...much better."
3,Not Worth the Price,"I was taken in by the marketing hype as well. The novel is not that good; and I read a lot of fiction with oriental themes. The characters are ill-defined; there is a surfeit of unnecessary and morally troubling violence (i.e., violence for violence's sake); and the plot is very strange. Some reviewers are trying to chat up this novel, but the cold, hard facts are in the sales numbers. It ranks in the forty thousand range on Amazon; and is not even in the top 100 on the New York Times list. That tells volumes about how good this novel really is."
2,"Not as good as ""Gai-Jin""","Very disappointing. Clavell was the master of this genre, and no one else even comes close to the depth of his characterizations, subtleties of plot, and elegant prose. ""Cloud of Sparrows"" seems to be a knock-off of ""Gai-Jin"" by Clavell. They're both set in the same time period, and the plots have many similarities. However, ""Gai-Jin"" was far and away a much better book. In particular ""Cloud of Sparrows"" has several fatal flaws: the writing is very poor (where was the author's editor?), the plot is completely ridiculous (a Texas gunfighter running around in 19th Century Japan trying to hunt down an enemy who has somehow become a buddhist monk?!), and the characterizations are extremely weak. When I finally finished the book (and it was no page-turner), I realized that I didn't give a damn about any of the characters. Matsuoka needs to take a course in creative writing; and Delacorte Press needs to do a much better job of editing."
1,Sound quality VERY poor,Like a lot of reviewers I find the difference in sound volume between the tracks and even in the tracks themslves to be extremely annoying and cannot believe that a professional sound engineer actually produced this CD.We have to put the volume up to ear-bleeding levels just to hear the loud parts - the quiet sections are inaudible.Full Disclosure: We bought this CD even after reading the other negative reviews because we thought people were being overly picky or were true audiophiles (which we're defintely NOT) but DO NOT BUY this recording if you'd like to actually listen to the music.
2,"Great music, poor mixing","I can't complain about the music and the musicians were fine but the sound quality of this recording is terrible. The quiter peices cannot be heard without drastically increasing the volume and then a louder piece, like ""O Fortuna"" comes on and blasts ones eardrums out."
3,Great Music,"The music is great, but as mentioned in other reviews, the sound quality of this cd is terrible. I found myself wondering how the sound engineer who made this recording didn't notice some of his mics were not connected. Almost complete silence while you barely hear the voice and drums seemingly in the far, far distance, then suddenly loud again. I'm still searching for a better Orff recording."
5,"An accidental discovery, I will never regret!","I have to admit that I bought this CD for one reason – at first. I bought if for my favorite rendition of Carmina Burana: Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi: I. O Fortuna. But then I listened to the rest of the CD and I found myself hooked. I found myself listening to “Dulcissima” several times. The beautiful lyrical singing of this one was just astounding, as they all are and I’m glad I was selfish enough to search out my one track and found a treasure trove within this CD. Sometimes things work out for the best!"
1,"Publisher Seraphim Classics, should recall all copies.","Carl Orff, Riccardo Muti, Philharmonia Orchestra. I thought this would be an excellent cd. I was strolling through Border's Books in Emeryville, and I saw this one on sale for .... So I bought it. I put it in the car cd player and listened on the way home. It was impossible to adjust the volume. The engineering on this recording fails to maintain consistent and reasonable recording levels. Depending on which track you listen to, and even which part of which track, the volume varies sharply between deafening and inaudible. I skipped on into the interior tracks, just to see if I could quickly browse out something worth listening to. No such luck. On closer inspection, I see that EMI Records did the digital remastering. I suppose this cd embarasses them greatly. Unfortunately, this recording is completely worthless. Amazon should display a consumer warning, if they continue to sell it at all."
2,Terrible,"The orchestra and chorus are not up to this piece. The intonation and blend are horrible, and the soloists far below average.The Dulcissime, the climax in tessitura of the piece, is absolutely ruined by a substandard soprano soloist effort.Avoid."
3,"Volume Control, Please","This performance of Carmina Burana is well executed under the direction of Ricardo Muti. The chorus is competent and has excellent blend. The soloists have a strong command of the opus and clearly enunciate the text. The major difficulty in the recording lies in the extremely poor control of the recorded volume. It is not possible to simply listen to the work. Because of the extreme range of volumes, it is necessary to continually adjust the volume so as to either heard the work or not be deafened. This mars an otherwise excellent recording."
3,Not quite deep enough,"This case is just barely deep enough to keep TENOR trombone mouthpieces from banging rims.The pouches, while soft and thick, are not deep enough for large shank bone mouthpieces. Even when jammed in as far as they will go the whole rim and a little more is exposed. This allows the two rims to make contact.The cover flap does not close tightly over the either beccause there is only one 1/4 inch wide strip of velcro to fasten to so you can't cinch it down to prevent movement.If you have large shank mouthpieces get a defferent case."
5,Perfect,"These are so cheerful-looking, and perfect for soup, chili, oatmeal, etc. because being stonewear they hold the heat in longer. They are deep enough to make oatmeal in the microwave -- the real stuff that takes about 3 minutes to cook, not the envelopes of instant -- without overflowing."
2,Buyer Beware,I bought this item a few days ago thinking from the picture that it was 2 bowls for this price. But only one came in the package. The price is too high for one little bowl like this.
5,Dare-Belief,I could not have taken and had a better experience with this CD. It was one of the best buys of this season for me. Each song gives you a taste of the different moods and gives you a sense of something new to come. Thank you so much!
2,"""Belief"" falls short of its predecessors","""Belief"" was in my opinion a decent Dare album, but certainly not a great one. The opening track, ""Silent Thunder"", is easily the best song on the CD, if not one of their best songs ever. But the rest of the album falls flat."
1,The Post says CHAINS as in Plural... more then 1 all you get is 1,You see a picture that shows 5 chains and a heading that's says CHAINS in the title... one would expect to get PLURAL of chain...which is CHAINS... you get one and you do not even get to select the style or size. This is false advertising at its best.
4,Intriguing and Insightful Guide to Handwriting Analysis,"This book gives you instant insight into a person's personality. This book has illustrations of different styles of forming a particular letter, and then next to the letter it gives the personality. I found that the personality insight is for the most part dead on target. The only down part is that I found that there were often many different forms for the way I formed a letter. So, I basically fit both those categories, and sometimes they would be contradicting. But like the author said, when we are in a certain mood, our handwriting changes. Also, in the ""M"" section, they didn't have the way I formed my ""M's"" exactly. Otherwise, I had fun passing this book around for other people to look at in my office."
2,Toothless...,"Yes, Alyssa Milano exhibits her usual abilities and nakedness. Yes, she is a hottie. However, she is far better in POISON IVY 2 (the weakest of the Ivy trilogy). Of course, as a story, EMBRACE OF THE VAMPIRE is a swirling toilet-yacht. This is an imbecilic romance novel (w/ extra cheeeeze) disguised as a vampire story. The love-sick vampire is a lame, whimpy dink of a fella. I especially enjoyed his pouty face and Wal-mart manicure! Oh, how I longed for his impalement! Alyssa herself is gorgeous, and does have one decent, semi-exciting scene w/ a wanton photographer of the female persuasion. The rest is pure, languid hell! If you want sizzle in your vampire epics, I recommend HABIT for pure animalistic sensuality... P.S.- Jennifer Tilly (Bound) is in EotV for about 5 minutes, and manages to be more alluring in her fully-clothed role than anything else in the movie! Just the sound of her voice reduces me to her potential slave! Has it suddenly gotten hot in here? Whew..."
1,Even the Nude Scenes are Weak,"Even Alyssa Milano flashing her silicone filled breasts, nice as they are and as cute as she is, cannot turn this into a movie worth watching. This movie is mindless in the writing, disjointed in the directing, and weakly superficial in the acting. What you get here is 130 minutes or so of boring nonsense interspaced with a few segments that total about 5 minutes of Alyssa Milano showing her breasts. Unless you are a male that is also a committed Alyssa Milano fan, you should just pass on this one."
3,Reviso Brasileira,"O Filme ""A Seduo do Mal"", assim traduzido no Brasil, e distribuido pela VTI, traz como protagonista a bela Alyssa Milano. Esse filme nada mais é que um pretesto para tirar a roupa da atriz. Para os fs, delírio nas muitas cenas de nu."
2,Alyssa Milano nude is the only good thing this film offers.,"Alyssa Milano stars as a college girl being seduced by a vampire who has to have sex with her to survive, or something like that. Silly erotic thriller has a story that makes no sense, has no suspense and no scares. The only entertainment value it offers is a nude Alyssa Milano. That means about 10 minutes of sex/nudity (Admittedly, the lesbian scene between Milano and Charlotte Lewis is steamy, if not a little too short), 80 minutes trying to set all these scenes up, not a very good bargain."
4,MUST have for Alyssa fans,"If you think Alyssa Milano is hot, then you will buy this movie at any cost. She has many nude scenes, and has pure heat. The plot is average, but... is that why you are buying it?"
4,Embrace of the Vampire,"Once again, good triumphs over evil, the nice guy gets the girl...sort of ""Charmed"" with more teeth and fewer clothes."
2,Could Have been much better.,I was very annoyed with a lot of parts. I am a huge vampire movie fan and this one was almost an insult. That Dracula was kind of gay. The dreams she had I did enjoy. I almost felt like giving the movie away.
3,Softcore Lesbian Vampire Porn,"And that's it. Milano gets naked, Kemp's vampire goes after her. In between we have some lust, some orgies, and a lame plot involving something about morals that I just can't remember. Sorry.It's cheesy, good fun that should appeal to the open minded of either sex as a date video. But make sure he/she isn't a prude. The only thing missing from this vid are close-ups...and Milano even does a lesbian thing, for all those lonely guys out there.Worth your time, as long as you aren't looking for suspense, dialogue, or a coherent plot. Oh, and if you're looking for lots and lots of softcore sex, well, this is your film. Rejoice!PS: I give it 3 of 5 not for the film, but for the fact that it celebrates what is--softcore lesbian vampire porn! And never deviates. As a film, it barely rates. As mediocre softcore with (semi)stars, it's brilliant."
2,NOT WORTH YOUR TIME,"Please don't watch this film. I mean, I tried to give it a chance. I was hoping for a good vampire movie, but I accidentally picked up a video that was more of a ""how-to"" for bad acting. Alyssa Milano really hit rockbottom with this. And the dude who played her wannabe vampire lover was a joke. The plot made no sense. Please don't watch this movie."
3,Some hot scenes in an otherwise weak film.,"I think Alyssa Milano made a really cute little freshman girl, and the scene where she's seduced by a senior girl was HOT! Unfortunately, that was also the high point of this film. I didn't care much for the plot, and it certainly wasn't scary."
5,The best non-horror vampire movie ever.,"The story is about a vampire trying to find someone to fill that special part in his undead heart. Alyssa is his target. She must choose between her undead suitor and living boyfriend. The story is good, and of course, seeing Alyssa naked makes the movie that much better. A must see for men everywhere."
3,A Great Picture,"This is one of the best films I've ever seen concerning vampires. It's the old and exciting ""the vampire falls for a woman who reminds him of and shares similarities with his deceased wife."" It's suspenseful, passionate, and sad at the same time. I love this movie!"
2,Embrace of the Plotless,"Hi, I am 15, and I think this movie was nothing more than soft porn with a weak plot. The part where the Lovesick Vampire bashes the womans head in the door than licks her brains off of it was Nasty. If you are interested in this movie rent it first or borrow someones elses copy to decide weather to buy it."
3,Alyssa Milano is Hot!!!!!!!!!!!!,I only watched this movie for only one thing and that is Alyssa Milano. Even though this movie was not brilliant it wasnt as bad as some of the other reviews say it was. I think if you are an Alyssa Milano fan or just like watching hot women this is the best movie you could watch.
2,Low budget soft porn,"Despite this movie's title, it's not even close to being a horror flick. This is a very low budget made-for-cable style soft porn with a rather random vampire element thrown in to make it seem more legit. The main reason for movie was made was to show Alyssa Milano nakkid.The acting and casting are terrible. Alyssa doesn't do too badly, but doesn't really have all that many lines. She's mostly expected to look like she's enjoying the erotic scenes, then look confused in all of the other scenes. The best scene in the movie is Milano's encounter with the photographer.There's a lot of cheesy, annoying voiceover by the vampire to substitute for plot, story and character development. His acting is the worst in the movie.Overall, the only reason to see this movie is to see Milano nude. Other than that, there is nothing else compelling about this film."
3,Embace of Milano,"Milano steals this movie, with her beauty and skin. The Vampire aspect of this movie is low. It is more about the trance of a vampire. I am still confused as to why this movie has an unrated and a R- rated version. This unrated version is worthy of an R- rating. The only scene that may be at question is the hallucinated orgy. But even so it didn't show very much. Worth seeing for Allysa, but not worth buying."
2,Embarassing,"Noteworthy only for Milano's willingness to shed clothes, make out with another woman, and feign torture. This looks and plays like a cable-produced cheapo attempt to lure viewers who want to see Milano's new and improved breasts."
1,Not worth Watching,"I haven't seen many vampire movies, but I can tell that this is a bad one. It is filled with nudity scenes for no reason.The film could easily finish in half an hour."
1,"Hahahaha ... What a ""deep"" plot !","This movie is only good for those that ""love"" Alyssa Milano. Plot? It isn't non-existent. It DOES exist but it's a complete crap! Period. Just an excuse to show skin.Regarding the DVD, it's a barebones one but picture and audio quality is as good as most New Line Cinema releases, anamorphic and stuff, plus it's the best release of the movie if we compare it with releases in other regions. You won't be disappointed in that aspect."
4,This movie really deserves a little more credit,This movie really is not all that bad. It has gotten pretty bad reviews in every article that I have read about it. As long as you expecting more of a love story than a horror movie you probably wont be all that disappointed. Although It does have some pretty good vamp action at times.
5,BY FAR THE BEST MOVIE EVER!,"The voices of the Academy spoke in whispered tones as they pay homage to the greatest performances ever to grace American cinema.Olivier, Brando, DeNiro, and now....Milano.Please ignore the moronic ill conceived comments of my fellow reviewers and purchase this infuential DVD right now. It is easily the best movie ever made.To be truthful, I did not watch the entire film, but I did watch two of the scenes with Alyssa and Charlotte Lewis over and over and over, so I feel well qualified to review this movie. Some will point out that I only watched the Lesbian Nude scenes, and missed several key points of plot and character development, but isn't that just nit-picking?In any case please disregard all negative reviews of this movie, and let said reviewers return to their agenda of poodle walking and blouse shopping with their ""life partners"".I await the sequel anxiously!"
2,embracing alyssa,"bought it to check her out, and she did show most of the goodies but other than that the show bombed not worth watching other than the occasional moment that martin kemp could have made her scream i'am a bad girl..."
3,Embrace of the vampire,"This is not a vampire story. This is a story of a girl who is coming of age. Yes their is a vampyre in this film, but not very well done. The girl in this film gets half naked a few times, this is not a cheap porno, it is a well made film with reasonable acting, not very realistic vampire scenes. still mildly intersting. Don't buy this if you wan't a good vampire film. This is a good one to buy if you like Alyssa Milano."
3,"Love Milano-Hate the weak, gay vampire!!","The vampire and the plot of the movie is weak!! The vampire was Gay and Weak and while he did kill a few people there was very little blood, horror,suspense or action on the part of the vampire. He (vampire) bit more guys than girls, which of course was big turn-off for me!! He didn't do much of anything except pine way about his past love and present desire for Charlotte(Alyssa Milano). There was no man to man conflict between the vampire and the boyfriend-he just fell out and the vampire disappeared after being disappointed by Charlotte's choice to shun him. I was expecting more from the sex scenes; I wanted to see more of Milano's behind and maybe some bush. I also wish to have seen more nudity and action between Milano and the lesbian photographer; that would have been a real turn-on!! The truth is without Alyssa Milano's nude and soft-core sex scenes there is no real plot."
2,Horror? no. Thriller? no. Lots of nudity? Yes.,"Look, if you come to this movie looking for a great story and very high quality acting, I am not sure how you got here. I have given this film 2 stars just for Alyssa Milano, who looks incredibly suculant. To make it worse, they advertise this film as a horror and I think I remember 2 dying throughout the entire film. The only, and I do mean ONLY, reason to see this film is for Alyssa's nude scenes, and her sort of lesbian scene with a photographer. The rest of the film leaves a lot to be desired."
3,"yes, a poor movie but some quite erotic scenes","OK, the vampire bit was just a vehicle to hang a plot on(and a bad one at that). Nevertheless, Alyssa has a beautiful face and body and the seduction scene with the female photographer was the most erotic 5 minutes ever filmed. If you're looking for an interesting movie skip it, but if your prurient tastes are piqued, you'll enjoy it plenty!"
2,Virginal co-ed is focus of lost vampire love.,"A rather uninspired vampire film with plenty of external anatomy thown in to keep the viewer awake. Mostly lacking in action, the movie follows the contrived descent of an innocent college girl into the clutches of a would-be vampire lover. Milano fans will love it - vampire fans will mostly yawn."
2,Just for Alyssa...,"This is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. But, wait a minute... Alyssa is naked and her breasts are just amazing. I have to admit that I loved Alyssa since the moment I saw her for the first time, so if you are a very fan of Alyssa and you are not interested in a good movie, this one is for you..."
2,Alyssa you can do so much better,"LOL i am probably the first woman who has bothered to review this movie. I came across this film while flicking through the tv guide one night, being a fan of Alyssa Milano, i thought that a vampire Milano movie couldnt be too bad, and probably quite interesting. HAH this may aswell be an Alyssa Milano porn movie. All of the films appeal is in the fact that Alyssa is nude in multiple scenes in the movie. The storyline is weak and the character that the film is based on (the vampire) doesnt even have a name! The special effects are also piss weak. I can see why so many men have given the film positive reviews but really..............cmon. Having said that I am still a Milano fan, but hope she can devote her talents to something better then this."
3,"ok, i guess","it was ok, but there was to much sexuality, and kind of ruined the love the vampire had for the main character."
3,pretty good...,"well, it is a bit average as the vampire aspect of it is horribly unstudied and unbelieveable, however i did get the story line which i must say was rather weak.the scene with the photograher was unnecessary, but totally helpfull as far as intimacy.i liked the women they showed. lots of great things and i guess i would reccommend this movie for those of you who have nothing to do for a couple of hours."
2,"Five star reviewers, I hate to say....got this one wrong.","It was very unfortunate that this movie did not work out as I love vampire love stories.Unlike other reviewers, I, a female, still think Alyssa Milano is more than just eye candy...in some of her movies; however, she must have been cutting her teeth with this film (pardon the pun). Her acting is mechanical and, yes, those fake [...] and very toned body does not suggest purity or innocence. I'm sorry, I know it is just a movie, but we like movies when they are convincing; that way the audience can connect with the characters to make the experience more real.This film is just a cut above cheesy. It has the caliber of a Lifetime movie: Worth watching if you like late night made-for-tv movies....or if you like to watch good-looking people getting naked."
3,For soft-core fans,"A vampire (Kemp) has 3 days to find the soul of his virginal true love and sleep with her or he's toast. As luck would have it he finds her in the body of a student, so begins a series of erotic dreams in which the vampire attempts to seduce his would-be bride. When rating this film I had 2 factors to consider since I bought it expecting a horror movie. For a a soft-core its very steamy without being over done, with Alyssa getting it on with Martin Kemp and Charlotte Lewis. But the vampire part is a after thought. There is no horror and the ending is no surprise."
5,5 for Alyssa Milano,"I would give 5 stars for any movie with enough exposure of Alyssa Milano , and I must say, this beats all the movies she ever made!"
2,not satisfactory,"I purchased this movie with the impression of watching a romantic tale of love between a vampire(sic) and a college student in dream picturized, but am dissapointed.Only plus point of this movie is Ms Milano frequently nude with a very poor story almost meaningless.If you are a fan of Milano then go and get it. Otherwise get other softcore products like frivolous lola,lie with me, dreamers,femalien and so forth."
3,For Fans,"It's Alyssa Milano. The plot suffers from predictability, but it's a movie for fans. If you Like Alyssa Milano, this is a fun film."
4,Habla espanol ?,A fun lucha vs. monster movie [possibly the first of this genre?] and a reasonably good print/transfer.However it does NOT have english subtitles as the Amazon product description states.
2,Trust,Isn't Elizabeth Warren that politician who got ahead at Harvard by claiming to be a minority & then turned out to only be 1/23 Cherokee?
5,A perfect Blue Note,"Unreleased until recently, this is another Blue Note gem with characteristic BN sound. Hutcherson never recorded a bad record as far as I know. Get this."
3,Not as good as Total Hockey,"This book is not as good as Total Hockey, it only has players NHL stats and not their minor and junior league stats."
4,A great cd for all those Hitman fans,"If you really love this guy Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart, then you have to get this cd. His theme in WCW is on this which is hard to find, plus he gives you all of his favorite songs that he has listened to. The movie and the cd are very emotional. You need to get this cd."
5,Wonderful musical!,"The Hunting of the Snark was a television production in England that I am lucky enough to have a video copy of (quality isn't the best, it's old and a transfer from PAL to NTSC), and I fell in love with the musical when I heard it (Justin Hayward sung the part Art Garfunkel sings on the cd). Mike Batt is a creative wonder and the music is just superb. Musical fans and fans of Lewis Carrol will all love this production. It's a shame that so many musical gems like this disappear into the out of print files so no one new can experience them,"
1,for finger boards,for use with fingerboards or rc cars. if you use it with anything else its so small youll fall off crack your head open and die
1,there is no packing info on this and i am wondering if it is still coming,its past the deadline and i cannot tell where it is with no pakcing info on the purcase who can i contact to get some help with this
4,here is how to fix the drill problem,if you dont want to drill holes in your driveway then all you need is a few bricks or other heavy thing to put under it to keep it from moving it is great for scooter and skate boards it is a little small for bikes though
1,Razor Punk Ramp,My grandson wanted this like crazy for Christmas but it really did not work very well. It is hard to keep locked down to ground and should have some type of lock down under it. The nail in the drive does NOT do it. He used it once. A huge waste of money.
2,great possibilities,"while the ramp has potential, it is somewhat trickey to secure it for use. There was no instructions included to assist with this, so I emailed the Manufacture (as stated on the ramp), and never got a response. My son is very disappointed with it."
1,Razor punk tiny,Was disappointed in the product. It was alot smaller than I anticipated. I thought I was getting a bike ramp.
2,small,i bought this ramp for my self thinken it would be good but when it arrived in the mail i thought it was for finger boards way to small for me
2,not a very good product,"this ramp is terribly designed for a skateboard. First of all, i thought this would be a bit larger. When i tried to go off of the ramp, my nose hit the front of it.Not only is it not fun, but you need to weigh it down if you dont want to slide around. If you are considering purchasing this item for use with a skateboard,i recommend something else."
1,It's just a ramp,"I'm very disappointed with Amazon.com. It has a lot of good stuff but when I saw this I had to write about it. The bike ramps from razor and esportsonline.com are ridiculously overpriced. It's a little piece of plastic and it is selling for $20. I can get the same thing from a local BMX store for 1/4 of the price. Sorry, but until you start selling these ramps a little cheaper, I am not going to do any sporting goods shopping on Amazon. No hard feelings. It's just the way I feel."
1,Too small for my tastes,I am a HUGE ski person and I got the jump it is so small for me because I am do like 50 feet drops all the time.___________________MY SUGGESTION___________________This is good for you starting your kid out on there first scooter they got for the holidays or skate board what ever you get him and its good for those things. Not Ideal what so ever for skiing. I got it to practice low ground tricks like a 180 at least so go for it if you are doing it for your son or daughter with there first scooter or bike or skateboard NOT skiing.
3,A little too small.,This looks better in the pictures than it actually is. You might want to think twice before getting this. You have to bolt it to the ground to get any good use out of it.
3,Needs a lot of practice,"Simple ramp, my son is 8 and thinks it is a lot of fun. However, it has to be secured to the ground or it slides all over. We didn't want to drill holes in our driveway, so I found some tent stakes and secured it into the grass at the side of the sidewalk. This way my son can skate or scooter along the sidewalk, up the ramp and land in the grass - much softer landing. I think it is going to take some practice before he actually can get where he can to the trick stage. I do see some potential hazards, so make sure safety equipment is in place for those kids not too experienced with ramps, probably not the safest toy, but a good starter ramp if used with supervision."
1,it doesn't stay put,"I bought this ramp for $15 and so I thought it was great but that was before I tried it. If you don't nail the ramp down, it moves constantly. Plus, the ramp is tiny. I mean to add on, the ramp curves up too much. This item doesn't even deserve one star."
1,"Awful, just awful","This is the soundtrack from Jim Reeves' ""Kimberly Jim"" movie, which was popular in South Africa and almost unknown elsewhere. The movie was average at best, and the same can be said for almost all the songs on this soundtrack CD. It's one of the worst selections of songs ever released by the legendary singer, and the whole album has a depressing feel to it. The songs all resemble the poorest songs from the Elvis movies of the same era. Finding a few good songs is almost a chore. ""Roving Gambler"" is a fairly good song and good performance by Jim, and ""Could I Be Falling in Love"" is pretty good, too, but by and large, all the other songs are forgettable. It's not worth the purchase to anyone but those who own everything else by the singer and want to complete their collection with bottom-of-the barrel material. His other CD releases present much better songs and performances."
4,Enjoyable Film Despite Some Issues,"Although this movie may not be entirely Historically Accurate, it is an enjoyable movie. It is a ""Popcorn Movie"" that should be watched as entertainment and not as a historical documentary. The acting suffers at times, and the sets could be better, but for it to not be a Major Movie Budget film it does quite well and holds together. The ending does leave you wondering a bit and yearning for more, but overall, definately worth watching. Fun Movie."
4,Fun viewing...,"So, ok, it is not Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid but I watched it not expecting it to be and therefore really enjoyed this movie. I would never even try to compare it, so, as a movie in its own right, it is good, fun viewing - probably better than lots of the block-buster rubbish out there these days. So, don't compare - just watch!"
3,Historically incurrect and poor ending,"A few problems here: The movie ended at an awkward place making you want to know more. Overall, interesting but not quite accurate. For any film makers out there - read ""Butch Cassidy - A Biography"" by Richard Patterson. Make a movie based on this book."
4,Fun read,"I've finally found a Flipside book that has lived up to the series description. This was a cute, fun read. A good way to spend a few hours on a Saturday afternoon."
4,"Fun, cute read!","I was in the mood for something light and fun to read, so I picked up Forget Prince Charming. It satisfied my thirst for a no-fuss romantic comedy in more ways than one! Haley Watson has had it with gorgeous, charming men who turn out to be awful cheaters. So she's decided to forget Prince Charming and go for the frogs instead. But Rick, her gorgeous new neighbor, will give her some love lessons and make her realize that good and bad men come in all shapes and sizes. There are some fun and memorable moments in the novel. This is a fun, quick read to indulge in with gusto. Perfect for the beach! Highly recommended..."
4,A 'charming' take on modern dating,I really enjoyed Natalie Stenzel's Forget Prince Charming. What woman in the dating scene hasn't been frustrated by all those seeming princes who turn out to be frogs? Haley's decision to turn tables and date the supposedly less-desirable guys turned out to be sweet and funny. I can't wait to read Stenzel's Pop-up dating!
5,Cute!,"I found the book delightful! Truly fun characters, crisp, lively writing. I'm looking forward to her next book."
3,Bleh!,This COULD have been a good book. It started out interesting and some parts were pretty funny but Haley started getting on my nerves and it took to long to get to the point due to something always coming in the way of them coming together. After a while (around the middle of the book) I just forced myself to finish it to get it over and done with.
5,This is THE book!,"As one reviwer said very well; ""Words are inadequate to describe the beauty and truth within these pages.""This book merges Advaita Vedanta and New Thought in a wonderful and easy to understand format. I was glad to find a book that teaches the very core from which every school of Metaphysics and Yoga emerged, the non-duality (There's no Good or Evil, just unconditioned energy/mind and our thoughts/carnal mind and concepts give things a label).If you want to learn real metaphysics, get it now, you won't be dissapointed. I have well over 700 metaphysical/yoga/self-help books, and this is the one I would choose, along with Silence of the Heart, by Robert Adams, if I had to go to a desert Island."
4,Deep,"This is not the kind of book you read only once, the thinking that must go behind the author's words requires at least a second read. Author Joel Goldsmith tries to teach the reader that all we ever thought we knew about Grace or about God was never more than but under our noses. Through the power of silence and the ability to listen to a still, small voice you will hear, the reader just may be amazed at what was there all along."
5,Teaches you to access God without any barriers,"The more I study Joel Goldsmith material, the more awed Iam by his profound understanding and clarity in expressingthe unexpressable. His wording, his perception, vision,and insights again and again move me, heal me, open me,transform me.I have studied Unity, Edgar Cayce writings, and manyothers paths. I loved them all, (and continue to work withthat material too), but they brought me to thisdoor. I am not rejecting those, but this is a Giant StepForward into the Heart of God. If you're ready for it, youwill love it. The only other Goldsmith book I like better thanthis is Parenthesis in Eternity. I have not read all of hisstuff yet...but plan to plow through every page before Ipass on! What a joy!"
1,There is evil in this world...,"A colleague asked me to read this, otherwise I never would have picked it up. And to be honest, I am not thrilled I read it.I am just not into this sort of stuff. The book is supposedly based on the teachings and ideas of Jesus, but boils down to a pop psychology, ""believe in yourself and all will be well"" type of message.The basic gist of the book is that if you just recognize that nothing is good and nothing is evil, then nothing can have power over you, and the karma of the universe will come back to give you health and blessings.What a load of crap.While I agree that many of the things we call good and evil are not inherently good and evil (a knife, cancer, alcohol, etc), these things can be used for very good or very evil actions. This is the glaring flaw in the book. He kept writing about inanimate objects, and diseases as being morally neutral. Fine. But it is what people do with these things that causes good and evil."
1,The Silence of Thunder,"This book was one of the worst I've ever tried to read. It was so bad that I couldn't even finish it. The author spouted scripture, but really had no knowledge of God at all. Anyone who might want to read this thing would be brain-dead."
2,Jump Drive Link,"My girlfriend bought this same product and had the same problems using it with a Dell. Lexar made it poorly and the plastic comes up too high. I cut part of the plastic off, and it works great now, but it is slightly difficult to cut it off.I wouldn't recommend this brand, and I'd suspect Lexar will be taking them off the shelves soon because of the malfunction."
1,Incompatible with Dell Keyboard,"I bought one of these and brought it home only to find out that the USB interface is too short to work in my Dell Keyboard USB slots. I have never had this difficulty with other swappable USB devices.As the USB connector in the back of my tower is inconvenient to access, I will be returning the Jump Drive to the store."
2,Too Much Fantasy....Not Enough Of Anything Else.,"As much as I like Tsui Hark, I can only recommend this movie to his die hard fans and anyone who wants to complete their Fantasy movies collection. This movie relies too much on special effects and not enough of anything else. Regardless, it's fun to watch once in a while as a novelty."
1,not as good as latter movies from asia,"However, when I first saw this movie (the 1990's) i thought it was a recent movie....therefore I admit I am a bit bias in my dislike....But, one should get Fon Sai Yuck, or Iron Monkey instead (or the Once upon a tome in china movies)."
4,Tsui Hark's landmark HK film of special effects and fantasy,"Tsui Hark, who went to film school at the University of Texas, is one of the most influencial filmmakers of Hong Kong. In this film, he made an effort to attract Hollywood special effects artists to come to Hong Kong and not only create a visually impressive film, but also to teach his team how the effects are done. This film was the result of that effort, and it shows. By the way, the previous mention of computer effects is incorrect. Not only does this film pre-date extensive use of computer-generated effects, but the suggestion that Lightwave is made by SGI instead of Newtek is also incorrect. Zu is a fantasy film, and the influence it (and other Tsui Hark films, like A Chinese Ghost Story) has had on other filmmakers is highly evident."
3,The birth of the fantasy genre,"When watching this film, consider the fact that it was made in the early 80's, so adjust your views accordingly.Having said that, Zu is a busy movie with a lot of subplots, and twists. It is enough to almost confuse the viewer. Within 3 minutes, the whole movie changes scenery while the characters change attitude.This is one of the few films where I enjoyed Sammo Hung. His character seemed to fit the ambience of the whole film. Yuen Biao was great, as usual, and a younger Brigette Lin also adds to the cast. In addition, the cameo by Tsui Hark was a welcome surprise.I would rent this film before you decide to purchase it. It's an older film, so if you're used to some of the later stuff, you may be disappointed."
5,Godhead HK Fantasy/Martial Arts.,"This is a very important HK film; its the first to impliment computer effects (SGI's LightWave Im told) for one thing, and yet the movie does not rely on them to any degree.. the battle scenes are as epic on occasion as the plot itself; an excursion into heroes, war, the world of martial arts, and even love.Its simply one of the finest period piece, fantasy/martial arts movies ever made, and is frequently cited as an influence even today.In a world being torn apart by fueding among the schools that compose the loosely defined (but ever present in the genre) 'World of Martial Arts', a young man seeks the aid of a great and mysterious master, to end the fueding and ultimately to save the world."
2,An outdated firework by Hong Kong's most eclectic film-maker,"Seminal in 1983 for its amalgamation of special effects, wire-work, and kung-fu, now ""Zu"" looks like an antique whose wrinkles are glaringly obvious next to today's wire-fu/fantasy films (""Crouching Tiger,"" ""Storm Riders""). Hark, like his contemporary Western counterpart Spielberg, ranges from the sublime to the subterranean, and ""Zu"" falls just short of his worst attempts (i.e. ""The Master,"" ""Once Upon in China 3""). However, Hark's visual palette with vast array of vibrant colors create a few striking tableaus that make ""Zu"" moderately interesting. But in the end, the lack of kung-fu and an engaging story leads to a big superfluous mound of color and chaos, which will only please the most diehard Hark or Hong Kong fan. BTW: Check out Hark's finest, ""Peking Opera Blues,"" ""The Blade,"" and ""Time and Tide,"" for the best cinema has to offer from the last fifteen years."
3,Sad time for John,This takes you thru the turmoil years of John Denver and you can hear it in these songs. Alot of repeat songs but can you have too many Rocky Mountain Highs.
4,Memories of a Country Boy,"This CD contains several of John Denver's hits, mabey the biggest of them. My issue with this CD is that some of the songs sound like they are being sung by someone else. I am not a John Denver fanatic, and have not hear most of his work, so I may just be in the dark about different versions of songs he may have done. This is a nice collection non the less."
2,An annoying friend ....,"is exactly how I would describe the self-absorbed, philandering character Lucy. I really did not care for this book at all. I felt that the plot was way too predictable and the behavior of the characters was extremely cliche. I probably would have been better off watching a Lifetime movie than wasting my time on this book. The book did have its funny moments but they were somewhat forced. I'd recommend taking a pass on this book."
1,"Dull, Trite, and Disjointed","I am an avid reader and have never once submitted a book review. However, after reading Botox Diaries, I felt compelled to write and warn you all that this book is dull, trite, and disjointed. I love my ""chick-lit"" books, but Botox Diaries is a disgrace to this genre. The plot is weak and unrealistic (even in light of the suspended disbelief one normally affords ""lite & fun"" books). The plot is also disjointed, perhaps because two authors co-wrote this book. The characters are shallow and excruciatingly dull. Botox Diaries is absolutely the worst book I have ever read.-- December 2005 Update: My friend insisted on reading this book (ugh...despite my warnings!). Even though she was stuck in the airport for eight hours, she still couldn't bear to finish the book, because she found it so dull. She actually left it, half-read, at the airport."
2,How is this getting four stars?,I was shocked to get on here and find so many people that actually liked this book? I am reading this book as part of my book club and I struggled to get to the end just to finish it. It is totally predictable and also a wayyyyyy far-fetched. Why would Jessie every be friends with Lucy? She is horrible? I could not stand to read any more about her! Story is just blah - not the fun chick lit I was expected.
4,Fun escape,"I just finished The Botox Diaries and was sorry it ended! It's a fast, fun read that met my expectations. The characters were caricatures who made me laugh. I didn't expect them to be just like my best friend or neighbor...I'm not a fan of all the reality shows on TV and I don't want that in my beach books either! This was a very enjoyable read that I would recommend to women who liked The Nanny Diaries or The Devil Wears Prada."
2,I'm Frowning-- not enough Botox,"Forty-somethings with homes, children, husbands, jobs-- but yet, one is unable to stand up to cheating her pea-brain ""best friend"" and the pea brain is too busy satisfying her shallow needs to notice. You'd think that when a grown woman, mother, and wife turns 40, she'd have some backbone, but this book is too busy being ""cute"" and dropping New York-brand names to get a spine. I'm amazed that a so-called ""friend"" would play the beard to her cheating buddy. That's just gross. Wait a minute-- Jess (or is it Terri Hatcher of Desperate Housewives?) marries, divorces, adopts a kid (??), and is doing her ex-husband after 10-years-plus-one hour? Wow- what a role model.Yuk. This book turned me off-- and I'm a liberal from California.I was hoping that with women aged 40+ I'd escape the teen-chick-lit genre and find a bit more depth. Wrong."
2,Very tiresome dialog,"It took two people to write this book? I was pleased to see a chick lit book for the 40-something reader but this book really was a waste of my time. You can see the ending a mile away, for one, but that didn't really bother me. It was the writing. The main character suffers from a syndrome that's unfortunately common to chick-lit heroines, which is to speak in an overly quippy, aren't-I-clever with my snappy dialog way. Nearly every one of her sentences included a quip/joke (or a quippy thought in her head as she spoke). Real people just don't talk that way, and it makes it impossible to relate to or care about her. By the way, my copy had the first chapter of these authors' next book attached at the end, and they've basically created the same two main characters: the quippy single mom and her ridiculously glamorous best friend. I won't bother with it."
2,The Botox Diaries,It's a cute story ... it just felt like the authors were trying TOO hard to be funny. Nice summer reading.
2,Ehhh.,"But this book frustrated me to no end. The thing I hated the most was the annoying dichotomy--on the one hand ""being rich is so uber awesome and it makes me more awesome than you"", but on the other hand ""being rich is not really more awesome than being a girl who is not that rich and is happy in her Gucci-less lifestyle."" I feel as though the writers constantly show the reader the luxuriousness of wealth, and then apologize as not to offend the reader in case she is poor. I'm a lowly schoolteacher by choice, but I still enjoy reading about the good life. No need to try to protect my feelings. The writers tried too hard to give the book a conscience, and in the end it failed.There were bright spots here and there and I did manage to finish the book (I'm not quitter). But all in all, I would not recommend this book."
4,The Botox Diaries,"This book is lighthearted, predictable, and I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a good beach read. It was fun, indulgant, and easy to read."
3,The Botox Diaries,"It was not what I was expecting. This is a really quick read, but it is not juicy enough."
3,Slow and Scary!!!!,"If you are younger than 40 you better prepare before reading this book; you might get wrinkles while you're at it.Slow, redundant, forgettable.Between botox, collagen shots, crinkled toes, saggy [...] and gray hairs you will be afraid of aging, and even though aging is unavoidable, I didn't find these characters compelling or profound enough. It made me feel 10 years older once I was done with it. No deepness or solidity I would say there's more lightheartedness and simplicity within these story. It's not insightful or remarkable although something that did strike me as courageous was the way the authors have opened up about the pressure women have to stay young and desirable and how they will get saggy and wrinkled no matter how many botox shots they get. Same thing goes for men; they will sag sooner or later.C'est la vie!"
2,dull,Considering I actually finished this book I was generous to give it 2 stars. I found the book to be dull and I could not connect with the main characters. I could not relate to the characters because they did not allow you to. The characters are somewhat thrown at you with no real background story to them. I noticed that the authors jumped from scenario to scenario as well without a real flow. I only finished it since I wanted to see if it ended how I predicted (and it did). If your looking for a good summer read this is not it.
4,Fun Fast Read,"A very enjoyable and fast read. The lead character is quite likeable, despite too many attempts to make her every thought funny. The writing and comedy is not as good as Pearson's I Don't Know How She Does It, but much better than many ""chic-lit"" books which have emerged lately. Wonderful for a few stolen hours of simple pleasure."
2,easy read,Rather weak predictable plot. Easy summer reading for mindless entertainment. Go for beach or poolside entertainment
3,Don't Let the Title Fool You,"I almost didn't read this book because the title led me to think it would be the chronicles or diaries of a woman getting botox treatments. In actuality, the book is a fairly typical story with central characters in their 40's.I found the book was enjoyable and light reading - certainly not great literature, but it was entertaining and held my interest. I won't spoil the story, so suffice to say it has a little of everything in the mix. I think the author was trying to have a regular person we could all identify with as the main character - but who dealt with the rich and glitzy to give us a little glamour. The best way I can describe it is that most Chick Lit books are written about 20-somethings - and these characters seemed to be 20-somethings with a chronicle age of 40. Chick-Lit for the Middle Age market."
2,Harmless fun,"If you've put your mind in cold storage for the summer, this is the book for you. It appears to have been written from an outline of cliches. The writing is pleasant despite the trite characters and marginal yet predictable plot. A good beach book. Don't read it if your mind is engaged at all."
2,Up and Down and All Around...2.5 Stars,"The Botox Diaries sets out to be chick lit for the mature women and ends up reading like you're a mouse in a maze and just wish you could find the cheese. I SO wanted to love this book but ended up just thinking it was ok. The storyline jumped around too much for my taste. I like sarcasm and dry wit as much as the next person but the authors laid it on too thick, it was like reading a nonstop Seinfeld episode. You also have to really pay attention to the qotation marks because you don't know if Jess is speaking to someone or just having the sarcastic conversations in her head.After all that said there are some genuinely good and funny parts in the book but most of it is forced. The authors prove that's two heads aren't always better than one. If this book would have toned down on all the sarcasm and kept a steady story line it could have been great. I say borrow this book from the library and save your money."
2,"Amusing, but predictable",I think the title says it all. It's a light summer beach read that doesn't require much concentration.
1,Watch Baz Luhrmann's version!,"This version of Romeo and Juliet is awful. The lyrics to the songs are awful, the way the ""star-crossed lovers"" find each other and automatically begin to dance provocatively on each other is ridiculous. The idea that two young people of different races liking each other would start a full on race war is unrealistic. If you're looking to watch something ridiculously hilarious, this is it. If you're looking for something that does Shakespeare justice, put your money toward Baz Luhrmann's version and watch Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes show you how it's done."
3,File this under...,"...Incredible beats, incompetent MC's. ""Infectious"" joins The Group Home debut, Slum Village's ""Fantastic Voyage"" and Jay Dee's ""Welcome to Detroit"" (to name a notable few) in being sonically superior but lyrically lulling. DJ Spinna laces up some burners here, showcasing his surprising diversity on the boards. But Kriminul just can't hang with the quality of Spinna's tracks. His pacing is all off with the quick tongue delivery and the style is just unspectacular and snooze-inducing. I felt discomfort in having to endure Kriminuls punchless rhymes while trying to appreciate DJ Spinna's high quality cuts. Luckily, some guests MC's were brought in to show some love (and skill) on the tracks ""Don't Get It Twisted"" featuring a flamboyant Sadat X, and ""Apology Not Accepted"" which brings in Apani B. Fly to drop gems and to help Kriminul save face. All in all, the beats thump along marvelously while the MC is still trying to get a mic check. If you're going to do this, do it for Spinna."
4,Sokka has a sister,"I have three daughters who love the show, Avatar the Last Airbender. And they absolutely love playing with their Avatar action figures, but I am at a loss to explain to them why none of female main characters are available. Sokka has a sister named Kitara. A master earth-bender named Toph who happens to be a girl travels with the group. Where are these characters?So for now, I just wimp out tell them that they're not made yet. And they add in a Polly Pocket named Kitara and another named Toph and play on. But this is getting silly. We're beginning to wonder how obscure the male characters will get before Fisher Price produces a *main* female character's action figure.So I'm giving this 4 stars, because my kids do love these action figures. But not 5, because you can't create the whole ""Team Avatar"". ""Team Boomer-Ang""."
5,The New Jimmy Smith Standard-Bearer,"before six views, the sermon was the tuffest jimmy joint out there, but six views blows the sermon away. like the other reviewers, i think blues #4 is amazing, and a jimmy classic like the sermon, the champ, & virginia wolf."
4,A helpful portion of the material needed for exam prep,"The book is well-written and edited. Content seems a bit 'thin' in areas (as with a similar book for prep for this exam), but that is probably due to the nature of the exam and its material. The practice exam included with book may be helpful, but there are others that are much better.The exam covers quite a bit of material and skills, so plan to include other study materials in addition to this book.Even with its weaknesses the book is a good value.Pete"
2,Just OK,"After reading both this book and the 70-297 Sybex book, there is no comparison. This book does not cover anything that you don't already know if you are on the MCSE track. It seemed to be more written for someone that is just taking this exam... and hasn't studied anything for the other 6 exams in the MCSE track. My advice, spend the extra $ and get the Sybex book by Brad Price... it will be money well spent, and you may actually learn something you don't already know... I know I did!"
3,better-quality,"Urmila's acting is one of many reasons to watch this film. Though it is not as good as I was expecting it to be, PTKK is worthy of praise due to the fact that a young director who had previously never sat behind a camera helms the project. Nevertheless, Verma's magic is clearly evident throughout and I am certain PTKK will be one of the better-quality movies to come out of Bollywood this year."
2,space filler,"The only reason J.C. worte this book was to take up time. Personally, I like to read about racing in a racing series. Anyway, in this book, Sam tries to make Sierra into a racehorse, but after unsuccesful attmepts, her and her boyfriend make him into a steeplechaser. It, as always, ends happily ever after. and people, despite my critical reviews, this is a GOOD series, and it's worth saving go to www.whitebrookfarm.com rite now, and sign the petetion to keep it going longer than book #72."
5,IT WAS AWSOM!,"Samntha and Tor turned Sierra into a Steeplechaser! Now that is something you can't do evry day! I think it's one of the best Thoroughbred books! But I don't understand what happened in #25! Where did evryone go!?!?! I mean, like Pride, Wonder,and all the others! And where's Cindy?! And why eventing? We all want racing! But I think that this book was great (To end with a good note)!"
3,okay ; so-so,"i think this book was very good, but the subject/problem just kept on changing. I would reccomend it only to those who have read all the books beforehand and plan to read the ones afterward, just so they would know what is going on. For those who only have read a few, i would reccomend something else (especially ""The Secret Voice of Gina Zhang"")."
4,"Okay, I guess...","I want to start off saying that Sammy is my 2nd fave. character( after Ashliegh), but I hate Tor.And I dont like Beth.I might have acted the same way as Sammy did to Beth.Seirra is cool, but I like the flat-racing better than steeplechasing. But once Sammy starts caring for Sierra, she starts to ignore Pride.I LOVE PRIDE!It was also about time Ashliegh and Mike got engage!"
4,"Great Dexter, but Bud...","I have no disagreement with the other writers about mr. Gordons awesome tenor power, but I would like to mention that Bud Powell is not really at his best anymore on this record. His very reason of moving to paris were his mental problems and problems with narcotics. From mid-fifties onwards he was never quite the same as in 49-50, wich I consider his best years. Untill his death in -66 his playing was at times just plain terrible. On special occasions, like this recording for example, he seemed to cheer up a bit and could at times give us short glimpses of the genius he once was, but other times... The reason I'm making such an issue out of this is that had he been at his best, this record would truely stand out as a landmark. However on this record he was unable to play like he once did. Hence only four stars from me."
2,sucks,I can't take much more of this. Everyone of the trib forcers are starting to work my nerves. I pray I finish this series quickly
5,Perfect for a older sibling .. Babette Cole's great!,"I have always been a huge fan of Babette Cole (Dr. Dog) and she has once again thrilled me and my child with her new book.Truelove is the name of the puppy in the book , and when the new baby comes the puppy feels ignored and ""not loved"". The images are a riot and wonderful , the message is wonderful. This is a hit with my daughters, and myself !"
3,ok,"hose and nozzle adapter seperate with the water pressure. need clamp attached to keep the 2 together,"
5,Black Rubber bands,"These are the correct replacement for my Panasonic vacuum and are working perfectly. Since you get two, you can have a giant rubber band fight with them."
1,"Generic, not Panasonic, & attempts to fool you","These are cheap, generic, belts that are stamped ""Flexalist"" and ""Pan Type UB8"". They may work, but I won't use them, as I consider them ""fake"". The packing slip goes to great lengths to try and convince you that they are ""real"" Panasonic belts, but they are in no packaging at all, and there is no Panasonic trademarking on them. Stay away from this supplier (Vacbelts.com) and its ""fake"" products! The shipping cost of returning them is almost as much as they charge, so I learned not to trust this supplier at a fairly low cost. Shame on Amazon for playing along!"
4,It fits,"I was needing some belts, I put it on and it fits, pretty easy to get on. I have a 12 yo Panasonic with the autowinder. I hope these belts will last me a long time, I think the install of the last belts I bought could have been better."
5,almost perfect,"Perfect in every way except, why did I have to buy 2? It took 11 years for the first one to need replacement. I'm sure by the time this one goes, the 2nd one will be long lost, thrown away or dry rotted. Anyway, leave it to Amazon to have exactly what I need and get it to me in a timely manner!! Thanks!"
5,"Mr. John Taylor, Jr.",This book reveals a very refrshing concept regarding our eligious affirmations. I would highly recommend anyone to read this book who has an open mind and seeks enlightning!
2,The usual from Sprong,Once you begin to discredit the Gospels and become your own authority what you get is Sprong. I trust the early witnesses of the Jesus story and Church father's far more than Sprong. Would I be called crazy if I mentioned the Holy Spirit and tradition of the Church. 'Jesus in the House' is much more to my liking. Peace
2,Who's Authority Are You Under?,"I can't help but notice all the ""21st Century Christians"" phrases throughout the reviews and even the book summary. Why is this made relevant to the bible? Why do people think that, we have to change and adapt as time goes on? God does not change.What happened to 2 Timothy 3:16? ""All scripture is breathed out by God, and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.""What does scripture say? Is it the truth? Is it God breathed? If it is, then it's the perfect foundation to lay your faith on, because it will never fail you. If it isn't, than you can't just pick and choose parts of the bible that seem fitting, because they are still all man made. All you are left with is experience, and experience should NEVER validate truth.Read John MacArthur!"
5,eye opening,The book puts into today's terms what the stories told of Jesus really are saying. A life-changing read. It helped me resolve some of my inner conflict with the bible.
4,Lots of facts,"The book is very thorough in details that the author obviously spent a great amount of time researching. It met my expectations and more. It is not a book for those who adhere to the traditional ""story"" of Jesus. For those whose are looking for the deeper meaning of Jesus and his life, it is a real find."
5,Thought-provoking theology,"Bishop Spong has always been either a pastor or an administrator and yet he unveils more scholarship in relating the N.T. to the O.T. than any of the scholars I've known in over 40 years of ministry. My whole career as a clergyperson has been spent trying to find tools, methods, etc. to revitalize and renew the Christian church. Spong, in his focus on the church in exile and in the ""young ones"" who cannot buy into what the church is communicating, has done more with his books, particularly this one, than any person or group has done before."
3,"""Deja Vu, All Over Again""","As might be expected, Bishop Spong's latest book is an informative, even occasionally entertaining read. But it's hard to escape the nagging sense, after having read all his books, that to have read them all is just to have read them one. In ""Jesus For The Non-Religious,"" Spong conceives of himself as iconoclastic when in fact he's once again playing the unwittingly comic missionary who, having despaired of converting the world to Christianity, has chosen the easier course of converting Christianity to the world."
2,Spong at his angriest,"This book might be one for anyone not that familiar with all the reasons why the New Testament should not be taken literally. But if you have read a number of other books on the subject, it offers no new thoughts. Why is Spong so angry?? Read the beginning chapters if you will but go to the end of the book and see why Spong still believes in the message of Jesus."
5,Bishop Spong has Really Done his Homework,"I'd gotten some other books that Bishop Spong wrote and I've never read anyone like him before. In this book he expands on the information he presents and it all makes a lot of sense! I really appreciate it because growing up Catholic I was so confused about what they taught, I had so many questions that never got answered, so I was pretty much languishing in the faith. I've been re-energized by Bishop Spong!"
5,Great book to read,"You don't have to be religious to know Jesus Christ. We should inspire to be more spiritual than being religious. The teachings of Jesus is not restricted only to those who call themselves followers of Jesus. In his teachings, Jesus never labelled his disciples....the followers of Jesus....Jesus was for all persons: poor, rich, gays, lesbian etc........Jesus transcended humanity, ethnicity, sexual orientation, class etc...this is the esssence of being human and to understand the teachings of Christ."
3,The Latest Spong,"This is an explication and development of Spong's non-theistic approach to Christianity. I appreciate his depth of analysis for many elements of orthodoxy, and his plea for a new and renewed theology appropriate for our times. While he reprises much of what his previous texts have said, he extends and clarifies his main themes. I recommend this book for those who cannot accept the literalistic, fall-redemption theology of many contemporary churches, and will be open to new understandings."
5,Logic,"This book throws a light onto the stories in the bible that for a lot of educated people find it hard to believe.For instance: Adam and Eve, Lot and his daughters, to name a few in the Old Testament, to calming a storm, Vergin Birth to name a few in the New Testament."
5,Spong Makes Sense,"Bishop John Shelby Spong makes the Bible and the person Jesus relevant to our world today.Scholarly, accessible and vulnerable, Spong shares his reseasrch and personal journey to his conclusions.Our family shared the book -- and it inspired hundreds of conversations."
3,Interesting book,"This was a very interesting book by retired Bishop Spong. For me the first part was more interesting than the latter. Stripping away old images and concepts or ways of expressing Jesus sounded interesting and was pretty interesting. However, when he went into the consstruction of new images and went into Tillich's concepts, he began to lose me. Weak on the new ways to talk about the Jesus experience.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,Nothing earth shaking here,"Granted I haven't gotten past part I, which can be summerized with the statement the the accepted gospels were written to make the life of Jesus agree with the proficies of the Old Testament, hardly earth shaking. Something that was repeated several times over 132 pages. If this book wasn't being discussed at church it would be headed to the local used book emporium. He also discusses the accepted gospels as being writen by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John even though it is known that the earliest copies of these works do not credit authorship, which I feel compromises Spong's scholarship.I have just started ""Jesus, Interrupted"" by Bart Ehrman, which I purchased at the same time more or less on impulse and I alread find it a more easy of a read. I may recommend it to our minister to be used in my Unitarian Church's Christian Covenant group. I deffinantly would reccommend the above book over Spong's as a study book on the Bible."
5,Jesus for the non-religous,One of Spong's best books. Great analysis his life's meaning and teachings and very rational explanations of ancient miracles.
4,A superb summary for liberal christians,"This book is the best book ever written for thinking liberal Christians who can see that our current theistic conceptions of religion and God no longer fit our understanding of how the world works. It is the best attack on biblical literalism I have ever read. It both challenged and strengthened my understanding of Jesus and Christianity. I would compare it to Richard Dawkins's ""God Delusion"" which also challenged and strengthened my beliefs. However Bishop Spong's explanation of the rationale for theistic religion was far clearer than that given by Dawkins (and far more convincing). My only minor criticism is that the last section of the book is really a cry for inclusiveness and tolerance rather than a clear summary of what atheistic christianity should be. Perhaps that's for the next book"
3,Competent though not Terrific Book,"Jacquard provides a competent if somewhat truncated book that covers much of the same ground covered by other Bin Laden authors. At something like 167 pages, the book is also a little on the short side. Nonetheless the book does provide some interesting tidbits not found in other books. For example, there are a few pages on Bin Laden's links to Iraq, interesting stuff. Overall this book provides a decent overview of Bin Laden and his objectives, there are better out there though. For the price of a paperback, however, this book gets the job done."
3,Bush didn't get rid of Osama,More than 3 years after Osama Bin Laden and his gang attacked us we still are having to deal with his threats. We need a president who will not lose sight of our true enemies. After losing so many of our young men and women and spending so much money we are no safer than we were on 9/11!What was the point?Please vote for John Kerry.
2,Offer It UP,"Silly book ,poorly told.I thought I was buying a thriller by the N.C. write John Hart.Will not recommend to others."
5,Another phenomenal album from Kevin Welch,"Here's a guy who deserves a whole lot more attention than he has now. Kevin Welch is one of the finest singer-songwriters working today. The music and lyrics he creates are rough-cut gems, and he performs them brilliantly. Like most great music, it's hard to categorize Welch's sound -- folk-rock, country rock, who cares? Just listen and enjoy. Welch is joined by several Danish musicians here, and they provide him with great support. You'll find a wide variety of songs, from the bare-bones ""Witness,"" which provides enough dramatic material for a screenplay, to the haunting ""The Sun King and the Winter Moon"" to the robust wall of sound of ""Stray Dog."" MILLIONAIRE is another big step forward for this strong and soulful musician."
1,"In Hollywood, once you're dead, you're GAY","Oh, God. Let's just get it over with and say that EVERYONE ON EARTH IS SECRETLY GAY. EVERYONE. This is one of the stupidest books I've ever glanced through - yes, GLANCED through, since I couldn't stomach slowing down to allow the words to stick in my head. Madsen, who I believe is secretly gay himself, is hellbent on making as many dead people gay as possible. And he can't write. I take particular offense at his chapter on Barbara Stanwyck. She was a brilliant actress and a very private person. Her life was relatively scandal-free. Mr. Madsen, you would be hurting right now if she were alive to crucify you in court. If only I could see that!!!"
3,pretty good bike rack,"We got this bike rack for our 3 boys to store their bikes. The supports that go on either sides of the wheel are a little wobbly, but do their job. It has worked a lot better now that they have 20"" bikes. When they had smaller bikes, the front wheels didn't fit into the holders."
3,"Good, but could be better","Certainly looks good and easy to assemble. The joints seem loose and it does not hold the front wheels of my kids' bikes. (12"" and 10""). Perhaps a larger bike will fit properly... hopeful."
2,Bicycle stand review,"This product did not assemble properly; two of the joints did not fasten together properly. However, it is still functional. After a few days of use, all of the parts become loose, however again, it is functional. If one is looking for an inexpensive bicycle stand that does not take up too much room and if one does not expect a sturdy and high quality product, this product will do. Otherwise, I recommend buying a different product."
5,bicycle holder,This was delivered very fast and I love it. SOMEHOW I ordered 2 and did not realize this but was able to use both very effectively. EXCELLENT PRODUCT AT VERY REASONABLE PRICEDebi
3,Not a complete waste of time,"When I first listened to this, I had to have it: the pieces are familiar yet totally original. As a bonus, the pop quality of some of the tracks are reminiscent of old Beatles songs. But upon further listening, I credit my initial exuberance to the novelty of the ex-Beatle's classical endeavor. I had no idea he did this sort of thing! I'm keeping the CD because I like parts of it very much, but I'd like to see Mr. McCartney attempt a larger work."
2,What's for ?,"Fi :( Nothing new was added to old known tunes, nothing new was created. It is pitty. Expecially after brilliant ""Standing Stone"". Sir Paul likes to play with symphony orchestra ? Let him do it. But he is able to do it much better."
2,Percy Faith And His 1001 Strings Play The Ruttles,"""Working Crassicle"" has its hilarious moments, the first part of ""Maybe I'm Amazed"", for example, but if you want the REAL stuff, undiluted, listen to ""Golden Throats 4: Celebrities Butcher the Beatles"" on Rhino Records."
1,Too many cooks spoil the broth (such as it may be).,"Strip away the various ghostwriters and what would you get? Probably very little, but at least not this soulless mish-mash.(Let's reconsider this remark: ""Gershwin's endlessly inventive piano take-offs of his hit tunes come to mind as examples of a composer who took his own hit tunes and did something fresh with them."" Note please that George Gershwin arranged these HIMSELF. Note please that George Gershwin PLAYED these himself. I see no basis for comparison with the Paul McCartney pop song arrangements included here whatsoever. In other words, it is quite beside the point that these string quartet arrangements are anything but ""endlessly inventive"". Neither, by the way, should we compare a Paul McCartney pop song to a George Gershwin pop song: Gershwin's pop songs are GOOD pop songs, not ""Junk"".)"
4,Third Time Lucky,"Macca's two previous classical outings, the uneven Liverpool Oratorio and the dull Standing Stone, fell squarely into the for-Fabs-obsessives-only category. On Working Classical, however, he plays to his melodic strengths and comes up with a winner. Both well-known and obscure solo compositions like She's My Baby and Warm and Beautiful work marvelously as short string-quartet pieces, creating a warm, emotional picture. The three longer orchestra works also come off surprisingly well, rewarding the listener more with each listening, the standout being A Leaf. A powerful non-followup to the rock classicism of Run Devil Run."
1,lipstick,"Sorry didn't like any of the colors, they appear to be outdated, under-colored, nothing bright and fresh! Gladi Davenport-Smith"
5,it's scary,"I think that anyone who listens to this cd is going to be extremely surprised, especially if you are an Elvis fan. The band that accompanies the vocals are top-notch, but Jim Brown's vocalization as ""The King"" will really make you shake your head in disbelief; in other words, he sounds so much like Elvis, it's scary. Gravelands is definately not your typical novelty type cd, as they have recorded mainstream songs such as ""Come as you are"" by Nirvana, ""Whole Lotta Rosie"" by AC/DC, ""Voodoo Child"" by Jimi Hendrix, just to name a few. I think this cd will really make you wonder just what the real Elvis would have sounded like if he had not died."
5,great,"Please tell me where I can obtain more info about James ""The King"" Brown.I've looked everywhere with no luck.Thanks"
3,Boring CD,"Almost every song sounds almost exactly alike. Not exactly stellar guitar work either. Stronger and The War is Over is ok, but the rest of the cd is quite boring."
4,Parallels the First Album,"I was anticipating the sophomore TRUSTcompany album and it does not disappoint. Although the overall sound is similar to that of the first, tracks like The War is Over and Fold really show that the band have grown instrumentally. Stronger is definitely a great choice for the first single, but overall this CD does kick some ass and if you are a fan of the band or are looking for something to rock out to then don't hesitate to go out and pick this album up."
4,A great follow up!,"I'm with Mr. Censored in that I was worried that they fell off the face of the Earth after writing their first album (which by the way was AWESOME). In ""True Parallels"", I was happy that they kept the same sound as they did in the first album because I liked it very much. My two favorite songs off the album are ""War Is Over"" and ""Someone Like You"". I did not like ""Rock the Casbah"" because it does not fit with the band I don't like covers, at all. Overall, the album is very good and I would recommend that if you liked the first album, you should buy this one."
4,Nice effort,"What I can say about this album is that it is not worse than their first one ""Lonely Position of Neutral"". This sophmore album still has the great heavy fast paced sound that trustcompany is known for. Vocally all the songs sound pretty alike, and there isn't as much screaming this time around. It's not bad but it isn't great. This album is an overall enjoyable cd to rock out to much like their first. Any old fans or new fans alike should pick this one up."
