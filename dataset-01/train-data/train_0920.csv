1,Mini Strobe Light,"Item was of poor quality. I did return it. Unless you use it in a closet, it didn't work well."
2,not for a beginner,"This book was hard to understand. I would not recommend this one to those who are just curious, like myself."
2,The Dancing Bible Code Masters,"If you're searching for a book that combines speculative science (Jungian physics written by a psychologist) with a theological slant then this is your book. There are undoubtedly valid ideas in this book (although no really new ideas if you bother keeping up with the current literature about physics, cosmology, artificial intelligence, etc.), but the unnecessary religious bias completely detracts from the primary argument. The Bible Code (also written by this author) was nonsense and this is not much better."
5,WW II Movies,"I grew up watching these movies with my father who lived through WW II. They are great movies that you never see on television anymore. During Memorial Day, they run the same few movies but never the great films of WW II. I love being able to watch them again and again."
3,Average Older WWII Film,"""Gung Ho"" is in the public domain and available on DVD from several sources. The Alpha release I viewed is sourced from a fairly good 16mm TV print. The only annoyances are quite a few sets of cue marks various TV stations etched on print to cue up commercial breaks. This film was still playing in theaters when I was growing up in the 1950's, reissued at the time by Realart Pictures. I'd always wanted to see it but never had the chance until now. It's okay for it's genre...stereotyped service men characters, no real surprises, a dated and somewhat silly sounding closing speech by Randolph Scott (as the Colonel), but it's put together and directed (by Ray Enright) well. Accept it for the time it was made and you'll probably enjoy it."
2,Gung-Ho is nothing amazing...but it is worth viewing!,"Gung-Ho!, a war film that takes place 7 weeks after the Pearl Harbor attack and details the volunteers that form the new 2nd Marine Raider Battalion, is a merely decent film with a merely decent DVD. While worth viewing, it is hardly even approaching the peak of it's genre (held, in my opinion, by films such as The Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now, and The Bridge on the River Kwai: better movies with better DVDs) and isn't worth a purchase. However, those other films come as highly recommended."
2,"Oh, to be bullet proof","I watched Gung Ho a while back(weeks) and when it ran first time in theatres(years). Let me think about it. What was the story line? It must have seeped through my sieve-like brain. Let's see, Randolph Scott et al were fighting the Japanese, our enemy of the moment. We collected more enemies in subsequent unending wars. Anyway, it's a world war two flick, sort of routine fare now, but back in the early nineteen forties we relished seeing evil, pardon the abreviation, Japs, decimated in battle. After the war I served in Japan . Tokyo was leveled and burned, but the Imperial Palace and the Di Ichi Building were untouched, where ,one day, I saw General MacArthur descend the steps to his car while the vanquished bowed as if he was a God."
1,Review,I would have liked to review this but it was never received and therefore I could not review it. It was probably delivered to someone elses house by mistake. Amazon refused to answer my emails and just took my money and never looked back.
3,Standard-Issue World War II Propaganda,"While watching this film, it may help to remind yourself not to view it through 21st Century eyes. This was made for consumption by a nation at war and, in war, soldiers must dehumanize the enemy in order to kill him. This is what made the casual racism of this and other films of the period (the enemy is referred to as ""Jap"" and ""monkey"") acceptable to the general public at the time. Today's audiences may (and should) find the references repugnant."
2,Oh.....Pookie....,"If It's Goodtimes, It's Garbage..!.....3 Public Domain Movies..Quick Buck Artists GoodTimes DVD Would'nt Restore Their Grandmothers 8x10, Let Alone A Movie.......I'll Be Uploading These Three Epics To Prelinger Film Archives Soon.........I'll Restore Them To High Quality Mpeg2 Files First....The Grande Kazoo Has Spoken..!"
2,Not a very catchy song,"I remember the old records in school with the math facts. They were corny but very easy to remember and catchy. These have nothing like that. They are too concerned with the ""in"" musical effects, etc. The kids weren't impressed and I wouldn't waste my money!"
1,You will be disappointed,"This is a poorly made video. Granted, it's a webinar placed on a DVD which should not leave you expecting a documentary style of film, but the quality of the sound and picture disappointed me greatly. Further, the speaker stumbles a great deal at the beginning. It was far from being polished. I absolutely do not recommend this product due to its low quality. This should not even be sold by Amazon unless the producers decide to get serious and create something worth the asking price. Poor, poor, poor, poor. Certainly there is information on agile, but even good information has little value if not presented properly."
4,Solid expansion of the Introduction book,"This book picks up and overlaps a little with Robert Oberg's ""Introduction to C# using .NET"" which I believe is mandatory reading for C# programmers.There is more detail and lots more information on the .NET framework itself. It's a thorough grounding in the general framework stuff.It is not, however, an exhaustive look at everything that you can do with .NET. A lot of subjects are given very cursory looks and you will need to add extra books to your collection for in-depth coverage of more of the details.Reading this book and its predecessor will definitely get you a solid grounding with .NET, but you must do it with a computer in front of you working through the examples and case studies."
5,Concise and Complete. A practical guide at many levels,"While most books on this subject tend to jump around and offer a lot of code snippets that may or may not apply to your application this book uses a sample application ""Hotel Reservations"" throughout that illustrates nearly all of the language fundementals while emphasizing the .NET framework. The application is developed in a way that does not necessarily tie you to the Visual Studio.NET development environment but still illustrates many of its features. It provides a very good overview of the .NET framework and provides solid comparisons to other OOP languages.This book was used as a text in a class of 9 and all reported that they found that it would help them do their job better. I use this book frequently when looking for examples of how to employ a particular C# feature such as Asynchronous Callback or Disconnected DataSets.Thanks to the Authors for a job well done!"
5,NOT FOR THE WEAK,"I first heard Shotzie on University of Washington's public radio station. It was the sound of glorious self-destruction.Karp to me: Skinny little guys shouting with everything they've got. These guys have more guts in their little fingers than most people have in their entire bodies. They build the heaviest, most powerful sound and bounce it off every wall in the room. They bash their brains out for your pleasure and invite you to join them. They are (and were) good men."
1,Zero Stars,"I'm thankful that I took this loser of a cartoon out of the library instead of purchasing it. This is the worst Charlie Brown film ever made and the folks involved in its creation should be ashamed. Charles Schulz would not be pleased. First of all, it features adults! Charlie Brown is supposed to be a kids-only universe, where adults are not even audible, let alone seen. The grown-up animation looks nothing like the peanuts - it's as though modern animation had been cut and pasted into the show. The story line is stupid, there is no existential angst to be found, and Charlie Brown SMILES all throughout. AAAAAGH!If you love Peanuts, don't see this one - it'll break your heart."
1,Junk,"This is the poorest excuse for a Charlie Brown cartoon I've ever seen. The animation is cheap, and it's packed with pointless padding designed to fill out 23 1/2 minutes. Toddlers won't care, of course, but anybody who feels affection for classic Peanuts will hate this shoddy direct-to-video program."
2,It's not the same!,"I'm a long time fan of Peanuts since my childhood and was very sadden with Schulz's death. I was excited with Schulz's very last video, but very disappointed as the style of his drawings are not the same. Schulz NEVER put adults in his comic strips or his videos which they appear with ""honky"" voices. I think Schulz probably died before he'd actually finished the drawings himself and someone else continued to finish the video by adding adults. ""It's the Pied Piper, Charlie Brown"" is such a dissappointment with adults. It's just not the same style drawings and having adults is a appalling. I would not recommend this video to others."
2,It's Not The Same,"Very disappointed. Like a fool, I bought it because I saw the words ""Peanuts Classic"" on the front of the case. Had I flipped it over I would have noticed it was copyrighted in the year 2000. I had thought it was an older video that I simply missed. Snoopy and the gang are hardly in the video. If you enjoy watching mice Riverdancing and squaredancing, and like the old ""corrupt Mayor"" routine, then you will enjoy this video. The only thing that remotely made this worth some of the purchase was the Charles Schulz interview on the DVD. That was interesting. However, I still recommend not purchasing this at list price."
1,"THE ADULTS ARE SEEN AND HEARD, MAN!",Awful! Stick to the older original cartoons. This is just terrible.
1,Didn't the producers realize something was going horribly wrong?,"O.K., the first 5 minutes of this video special are not bad, but once Charlie Brown starts telling Sally the story of the Pied Piper you may as well pop the disc out.In true Peanuts tradition, this story should have been told from the perspective of Charlie Brown & the Peanuts Gang. Instead we have ADULTS TALKING & discussing their problems. Through out the entire show, I kept thinking of the way it should have been told.Now this is not the first Charlie Brown Special to include adult voices, that violation goes back to ""SNOOPY's REUNION"" where the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm owner talks for no reason at all.The bonus material is not specific to this special, it is more of a general look at the making of these specials. It's likely the specific reason for including it here is to fill out the disc beyond the 25 minute story.There are many other Charlie Brown DVDs worthy of purchasing, buy this only if you are a completist."
5,good movie!,you can't go wrong with Charles M. Schulz. Who doesn't love Charlie Brown and the whole Peanuts Gang! It's a classic. fun for the whole family.
5,An Amazing Tale With An Amazing Bonus,"It's different from older Peanuts tales, but that doesn't mean it's bad! It's wonderful, and the Charles Schulz interview which is included is free! ..........."
2,VERY UN-PEANUTS,"Unfortunately, this video strays from the Peanuts norm. It has very little to do with the Peanuts characters, and has more to do with the altered re-telling of a fairy tale. There are adults talking and singing throughout the movie, and the Peanuts characters seem very out-of-place in this adult-inclusive environment. The Peanuts characters are drawn in ""Peanuts"" style, but all the other characters look like they could be characters in ""Frosty the Snowman."" The different styles of animation do not mesh well.The only redeeming quality of this film is the 10-minute talk with Charles Schulz at the end."
2,It's not the same!,This is not Schulz who drew all the strips in this video. There are adults--lots of them which is so un-Schulz as he does not believe in having adults appear in his strips or his videos. I think Schulz probably died before this video was completed and someone drew it for him to complete this project. I was at first excited being a long time Peanuts fan of the upcoming video and after purchasing the DVD of this video and I am appalled with the style it was done and the inclusion of adults.
2,"think carefully before ""following"""" Pied Piper","chidren are 2yrs. and 3yrs. and LOVE Charlie Brown cartoons, however they wre not very interested in this particular movie. maybe they are too young for this charlie Brown movie. The 3yr. old watched for about 10 min. before becoming bored with it and the 2yr. old barely made 5min.(and she can sit and watch an entire Charlie Brown movie!!) will try this one again in about a year or more."
5,"It's a Bear, but a Serpent's Tooth","This is a big, heavy, long lens--a little too much for a walkaround--and with all those elements, you want to be careful about shooting into the light. But once you use it, you'll want to carry it around, making little cooing noises--think waist pack or holster pack. Nikon's non-VR 80-200 is legendary--this one is sharper yet, and the VR does indeed add 2 EV, for what would be an effective f/1.4 on a non-VR lens. The VR makes it very hand-holdable, but to see what it can really do, shut off the VR and put it on a tripod. You'll need your best technique to really max it out."
5,Must have lens,This is a must have lens for anyone serious about their photography. I take pictures of my daughters softball team and as their games start at 5:00 they end as dusk is settling. With this lens i can go 3 shutter stops faster and have little or no blur. Its worth every penny i spent on it.
3,Not for FX Sensors,There is vignetting when lens is opened up. There is also poor focus around the edges at all f-stops. I was using with a D700 so I returned the lens. Otherwise it focuses rapidly and silently. I would give the lens two stars for FX sensor and five stars for DX sensor.
5,You get what you pay for,"I've had this lens for about 4 months now and am amazed at the quality of the images from it. Coupled with my D300s, it produces sharp images at f/2.8. I really have not tested it at the small end of the aperture scale. I recently shot some high school basketball games and was very impressed with the results. As many may know, lighting in high school gymnasiums is not the best. Yet, with this lens, I was able to get excellent images. Focusing is fast and quiet. The build quality is excellent--no compromises here. It is a hefty lens, but with the D300s + grip, it balances out reasonabley well. I recommend extended use to be with a monopod or tripod. It is an expensive piece of glass, but each time I see the results from it, I smile!!"
5,My first VR lens,"I've been using Nikon lenses for years but this is my first VR lens. It works. Hand-held at a 1/50 sec I got tack sharp shots. And that was with the 1.7 teleconverter. On the way to do those shots the camera and lens took a tumble out of my truck onto a parking lot. The lens shade got it's first beauty mark, but every thing worked perfectly. Lens, converter, and D200."
5,Simply Outstanding,"This lens is simply outstanding. It may take you a while to get used to the weight of this ""hefty"" lens, but it is worth the break in time. If you purchase this lens I guarantee your other lenses will spend more time on the shelf than on your camera.This lens is well worth the money."
1,Buy this lens locally!,"Problem: 70-200mm lens has excessive ""play"" when mounted. It rotates about 1/16 of an inch.I have 6 other Nikkor lenses I use with my D300. All are tight when mounted with no excessive movement.I have checked with 3 other photographers who have this lens - their lenses are ""tight.""The excessive play shows up as rotational motion blur and irritating camera rotation on tight shots.Not something you would expect for a ""pro"" lens.The local Nikon rep says it's normal, but I think it's out of spec - poor quality control.Under warranty I can sent it in for repair. But, more expense, more time lost and no guarranteethe problem will be resovled. Nikon screwed up a past warranty issue.In the future I will buy expensive lenses locally so I can try them first. It will cost moreinitially but what price do you put on the irritation factor and loss of resale value."
2,Can you say Return to Sender!,I just received this lens to use with my Nikon D700 and was immediately taken back by the amount of vignetting that occurs on a full frame FX sensor. Not acceptable for a lens of this price range. Hopefully Nikon's next offering in this category will address this.
1,vignetting vignetting vignetting vignetting,"Vignetting. Always.We purchased these lens to use with Nikon DX and 35mm cameras.Why do the have vignetting on the D3 and D3X?What is the deal?What a freaking nightmare.Nikon knows it, too.Look, now they are selling another 70-200 that is FX format.Basically, this lens without all the vignetting."
4,Fantastic AND gives your arms a workout,"This lens is great, great, great. Solid build, great optics, silent fast focusing and just perfect.It is heavy, and will give you a workout, but will be worth it for the quality of the pics."
5,Nikon 70-200 2.8 VR,This lens has opened alot more shooting opportunities for me. I can't think of anything to say that hasn't already been said. Just an excellent lens.
5,Always getting your way is bad for your character,"I love almost anything that Tamora Pierce writes. This book can stand alone, but is better if you have read the Circle series and the Circle opens series that come before. This shows the quartet of young mages as they have become adults and face the differences in their relationship and their magic as time has passed."
5,One of the best!,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. It's very inspiring to me, and helped me understand the characters even more. It's definitely worth the purchase price!"
2,Too Adult for a Young Audience,"This is a well written book. On the other hand, this book is not suitable for my young adult(13-16) age group. The biggest reason is that the author turned one of the characters into a lesbian. The sexuality content is far too prolific for a young audience. As are some of the issues dealt with throughout the story. I do not recommend this book for someone under the age of 17."
1,Poorly written,"This book was a big disappointment. The characters are shallow. The story lines in the book get mixed up, disappear and suddenly reappear in different priorities. The relationships/romances are shallow as well. No one comes across as a strong character or a compelling character. And why the author has to throw in a strong homosexual theme is mystifying especially considering the age group she usually writes for.DOn't buy it there are other great fantasy books on the market."
2,warning needed,"there is lesbian content in this book. As reader who feels that is controversial and not a ""young adult"" appropriate reading material I am not impressed with this book and that there wasn't some sort of warning label attached. I am disappointed that the author went that direction and didn't keep her book young adult friendly. This should be in the Adult section. I have always loved Tamora's books. She has an amazing imagination and she is a gifted writer. So this was a disappointement to me."
4,Great work.,"I was actually very impressed with this book. Though I like all of Tamora Pierce's books, I especially love her latest efforts. The Will of the Empress is certainly more mature than the Circle of Magic, but I doubt that it has been written that way to discourage younger fans of Briar, Tris, Daja, and Sandry from reading it. I was especially impressed with her handling of homosexuality through Daja (and passing mentions of Lark and Rosethorn). She introduced the relationship the way any other relationship would be introduced, and never treated it as anything other than what it was - a perfectly normal occurance. Showing younger children that the entire world isn't straight and white is no small task, especially with a well-loved series such as the Circle of Magic, but Tammy does it with style."
4,"We're getting better, Tammy!","While some of Ms. Pierce's work as of late has been rather monotonous and predictable, but this book breaks the mold. A much better read than some of her other stuff, this takes the characters we know and love from the Circle books and reunites them again. There is some backstory mentioned she didn't write in the Circle Opens series, leading to a disconnected feeling, but that could have been intentional. Some of the problems and scenes feel forced, and I'm very upset with Ms. Pierce for stereotyping Daja the way she did (read to find out), but overall it was good."
4,The Will of the Empress,"I have not read this book yet as it has not been released, but I would like to say that if this book is anything like the first and second books, it will be a masterpiece."
4,Wonderfully done,"This book about our four circle mages is written to a bit older audience than is the first 8 books. The tale is well written and interesting.It tells of the tales of Sandy and her 3 friends as they visit Sandy's cousin the Empress Berenene of Namorn, who has demanded that she come for a visit.Empress Berenene of Namorn is a very strong woman and well mayhap not the nicest either. Power has gone to her head and she likes to get her own way... And she wants Sandy to marry, have children and be a good little cousin and be quiet.Sandy isn't all that interested. But when her cousin won't take no for a answer, things begin to get interesting.Tamora Pierce once again proves why she is one of my favorite authors and I look forward to many more of her books."
1,unfortunate turn of events for an otherwise inspiring series,"I have loved all the previous Joshua books. But I barely could bring myself to finish this one. Clearly it was nothing more than a justification for the catachism of the Catholic church and its blatant disregard for the Word. I understand many of origins of the Catholic churches doctrines but must object to Father Girzone's long-winded attempts to justify them in the context of this story. His insistance that this is what Jesus would say were he walking among us today approaches insulting. Previous stories uplifted and inspired, this one offended. If there were ever another Joshua book, I'd give it a try because I loved the others. But this was a total miss. If you are a dedicated Catholic who has no qualms with the doctrine, you'll love the story. Protestants who don't have opinions on the Bible will also enjoy this book. Those who believe that the Bible is a literal source of knowledge and prophecy, steer clear of this one."
4,JOSHUA : THE HOMECOMING.,"HAVE READ MANY OF THE JOSHUA BOOKS. THEY ARE A BIT PREDICTABLE, BUT I ALWAYS FEEL SO GOOD AFTER READING THEM.I WILL READ ALL OF THE SERIES AT SOME POINT. HAVE LENT OUT ALL OF THE BOOKS I HAVE PURCHASED AND EVERYONE LIKES THEM ALSO."
1,Sly New Age Book,"After reading this book it is apparent that a New Age Philosophy is being proposed for the salvation of mankind. The book states that we are all basically good and we will achieve a future utopia through our good works. As far as absolute truth goes, we will have to choose between Girzone's imagination or what the Bible clearly teaches. As for me, I will trust Jesus Christ as revealed in the Bible."
4,"Still great, even if it's not the best!","I too have read all of the Joshua books, and I too received this one as a Christmas present. I was excited to start reading it because of the love I have for the others. I agree with MiChal and Firstjeb that it may not be the best, but I think it was still consistent with the overall Joshua theme. As Michal says, it still stimulates thought, and every one of the Joshua books, including this one, helps me to believe that Christ is real, that He is here with us today, and that everyone of us is meant to represent Him like Joshua does. Something I enjoy about the books is that they feel almost like biographies, and even autobiographies in spots. My biggest problem with this book was that it seemed to start out more like a fictional novel. Nevertheless, it did pull me in just like the others did and had me as engrossed as ever. Worth buying for even the most critical Joshua reader!"
4,Good Stuff!!,"This is a great cd. Not the overplayed trance music that people are so used to hearing in clubs and ""massive"" raves. The tracks are interesting and have a much more driving edge. This cd is nice b/c anyone who likes either trance or psytrance will like the music."
4,A great Account of the Battle,"John Toland is a very interesting writer, who gives an outstanding account of the largest battle ever fought."
4,Battle: The Story of the BulgeJohn Toland,"This is a great historical account of the Battle of the Bulge. It is a story told from all levels of the conflict, from the individual foot soldier to the commanders of the battle.The book was exactly as described. It was a great price. It shipped quickly. I am very pleased with the entire purchase."
4,Battle: Story of the Bulge,Battle: The Story of the BulgeJohn Toland is one of the best writers I have come across in my reading of military history. I still believe his book is the best I have read for individual accounts of the battle and it was published in 1959. He carries the battle from day-to-day with stories of the GI's along with some Germans and also some civilians.
5,A Great Read,"I have been on a WWII binge for about a year now with a primary interest in the ETO, starting with Ambrose's books. Just finished John Toland's ""Battle"" and was really sorry for it to end. A great read that really expands my knowledge of the efforts of other US units in holding the line prior to the arrival of the 101st. While the book does not denigrate the heroic actions of the 101st, it certainly lets the reader know that without the defensive actions of other military units on the 'Ghost Front' the 101st would have never been able to even arrive at Bastogne.Toland does an excellent job in weaving the actions of the grunt soldier in with that of front line officers and their higher-ups. And as an earlier reviewer noted, only in the Epilogue will one find Toland's editorial opinions, the main body is free of such suppositions.I am now looking for other Toland works, but it seems that most are in the 'collectible' category, and quite expensive!"
4,Toland like Ryan,Battle is one of the more accesable books on the Battle of the Bulge. It has been around long enough that I own it in a 0.75 paperback. Like Ryan's Longest Day this book is a collection of focused stories within the frame work of a battle narrative. It's main virtue is it's readability.
3,"It's entertaining, but","I doubt that any book about the Battle of the Bulge would be not entertaining. But this book has way too many characters, and the narrative jumps around. Also, there are some details I could have done without like the soldier who crawled into an abandoned bed and stayed there for an entire week. Why is that illuminating? That is one subplot I could have done without. But, I did want to hear about the cooks, and other rear echelon troops of the 99th division who completely threw off Hitler's time table in Losheimgraben. The book completely glosses over that heroic stand.So, basically the book is a mixed bag of good and bad."
1,Horrible Sale,"I order this item over 6 months ago. The Jersey never showed up, but my credit card was still charged for full price plus shipping. I have made multiple adempts to contact them and I have yet to get a response. Do not order save your time and money. I recommend you just wait till next season and buy a jersey in store."
1,poor fantasy!!,"Since nobody has bothered to write a review on this book, i'll do it in case you are considering to get this book.This is the second book in the sword and circlet trilogy and its more boring and stupid than the first book (keeper of edanvant). Neither the plot will not grab your interest nor the writing skill. Even the characterisation is very thin with simple and stupid dialouges. So I'll suggest you to skip this book and look out for some better one or else you are just wasting your money."
5,"Thrilling, dazzling and yet nuanced","A breathtaking performance by probably one of the greatest pianists alive today. The piano concerto for the left hand is a dazzling performance, heroic, while keeping all the nuances. The orchestra fits well with Zimermans performance. Would recommend it very much! Can't wait myself to hear the new release of Zimermans' Chopin concertos"
5,Breathtaking beauty,"Krystian Zimerman is one the very few truly exceptional geniuses that can make the piano sing. His colors and tones are of a breathtaking aesthetic beauty as only a Rubinstein or Horowitz were able to produce... French composers appear most suited for him, just look at his Preludes from Debussy. If you love piano, by all means get this CD."
3,Intriguing jungle life but unhappy ending,"This is a fascinating account of native life in the jungle of the upper Amazon. The use of drugs resonates with the counter culture. Manuel Cordova-Rios was captured by the tribe and groomed to be their leader. He takes over when the old chief dies.At the end of the book Manuel secretly leaves the tribe for good. We are not told of their fate, which may have been bad. The rubber cutters were intruding into native lands, not only killing them, but causing conflicts between the tribes.It is the same old sad story of native cultures being destroyed by the exploiters."
2,My mind wandered,I have been a life long Catholic. I dug and dug but did not find anything new to me.
4,Good read for an older Catholic,This is a good book for a prayer group to have a fuller understanding and appriciation for the Mass. The details explain every action and work of the Mass. The only thing lacking is a more complete cross reference to biblical sources.
4,If Your Mind Wanders at Mass,"great little book. I liked that this book covered all the parts of the mass, adding to my knowledge in all areas, without going on for too long, or too deep in any area. Just enough to learn more but not so much that it was overwhelming."
5,Great for new Catholics,As a new catholic this book has been very helpful. My mind does not wander at mass but this books helps me to explain and undertand some parts of the mass.
4,One of the best of Delacortas Gorodish and Alba stories.,"Out of the 6 books Delacorta has written starring Serge Gorodish and Alba, this is one of the best. The first few chapters dont make a lot of sense if you havent read Vida, but at about chapter 4 you have trouble putting it down. The reason for Gorodish being sent to prison was hilarious, I thought. Its worth reading the book just for its ending, which Im not going to tell >=D You have to read it yourself."
4,Too short for some!,"Well i bought this for my Epiphone Les Paul (56 Goldtop Reissue) and the case was too short.Fortunatley it fit my 1990's Limited Edition Epi Les Paul, hmmm . . . I didn't know they varied in length.Anyway, this case works great for that one and it's quite plush and sturdy. a lot of BANG for the buck!.The case is a few inches shorter than an actual Epiphone case so beware, but it's a fraction the cost."
4,"This is a really nice case, especially for the price. Not sure why everyone complained it was too small, it is almost too big","This is a really nice case, especially for the price. Not sure why everyone complained it was too small, it is almost too big (we like the guitar to fit snugly). Highly recommended, super fast shipping too!"
2,Took Trip and Latch Ripped,I took a trip days after my immaculate guitar case arrived. I was so proud of the stong black beauty and carried it with my head held high through the airport. They must've thought i was some kind of Rock Star. I checked the bag in with my precious new gutiar inside. I has to loosen the strings before it flew. I did so and taped it up nice and securely. Amazingly it was the first off the belt and was pristine it had survived the trip. However on the way back there was a dissapointment. One of the latches became inoperable because the piece the ring latches onto went missing completely. How this could happen I don't know. But I do still have the case and it still seems that it's too much trouble to return the case. It's such a big item maybe they could send a spare latch instead or just send me a replacement and i will send the c ase back in it's box. David Hutchinson [...]
1,Not for Epiphone,If you have an epiphone les paul avoid to buy that guitar case.that case is to short to an epiphone electric guitar.I'm very disapointed.
2,did not fit a standard epiphone les paul,"i took a chance (even though i saw reviews with warnings about too small a size) and ordered it on amazon, had to cut part of the inner upholstery in order to fit the guitar ..."
3,Case too Tight for Epiphone Les Paul 100,... case was too short to accommodate Epiphone Les Paul 100 ... had to peel back the interior fuzz cloth of the case by the head stock and remove the glued in wooden support so the guitar would fit properly ... reapplied contact cement ... guitar fits nicely now ... Musician's Gear obviously didn't factor in that 1/4 inch support piece when creating the prototype.
4,Les Paul Case,"Nice case for the money.Protects well. One thing if you but one of these,open the case for about 3 days and let let air out. Glue has intense odor.Other than that,worth the coin,absolutely."
3,Check the length of your guitar before you buy this case,This case has a smell of of glue.I bought it for my RockSmith guitar which is a Les Paul Epiphone juniorThe case is too short for that guitar.
5,Well worth the time to read if you testify as an expert,"Everyone who has testified in Court has at least one horror story where the attorney made them look foolish or worse. This book prepares you with an understanding of the process, procedures and roles of courts and attorneys. Knowing how to handle those tough situations can increase confidence on the stand and reduce the disenchantment of having been ""brow beaten"" by an attorney. Everyone, but the most experienced expert witness will find this book invaluable."
2,was disappointed,I was very dissapointed with this Hits of Stevie Wonder if I could have listen to the songs before I bought it I would not have bought it.
5,Haydn Op.54/ Endellion Quartet,"I don't have any compares, but the Endellion came highly recommended here, and they do not disappoint. Everything is crisp and alert.Not much to say except if you can get this for $.79 like I did, then you're cookin'! The sound image may, just may be slightly less than immaculate, but it's no worry, and the playing is deliciously woodsy.Many people's top recommend for a modern Op.54."
4,"Good, but could be better!!!","The watch is really beautiful, but it lacks instructions on how to set time and date. I had to search around to find out. But it's worth buying."
5,"awesome CD player, once you get past the headphones","I bought this CD player just under a year ago, and I really love the sound. The headphones that come with it, however, are quite uncomfortable (they almost hurt) and the sound from them is horrible. After buying new headphones, the CD player was great (I'm listening to Green Day with it as I type). A few months after buying it, the buttons started acting really wierd, but that went away after about 2 weeks, and it hasn't happened since. I would recommend this player to anyone, with it's great sound, very slim design (fits in the pockets of every pair of pants I own), and great durability (I bring it to school every day)."
5,The Best,"As always, Dionne doesn't disappoint. Even in these latter years of her career, she still has the presence, style and voice that is only hers. One can never go wrong with a Dionne song no matter whose done it before. She is truly a gem and a class act."
5,Dionne concert,I bought this because I wanted it to be like the concert we saw Dionne in 2 years ago. And it was. Very good. I will treasure this.
5,The BEST Techno Bass in The Universe,I'M FROM BRAZIL.The DYNAMIX II Single 'Just Give The Dj A Break is the one of the best beats in the universe.
2,"Title of book should be a very, very, short story....not very well told.","Title of book should be a very, very, very short story...not very well told."
3,Check out from Library,"Not a book I would recommend buying new...see if you can get it from the library first. I agree with the other reviewers. This book is too short to spend more than $10 on; however, the topic is interesting. If you are a true history buff, you might enjoy this book. Considering that this book was originally written in French, I fear that some of the details may have been lost in translation. Some parts in the book came off as a little dry."
4,The Wreck of the Batavia,"I was fascinated by this concise, easy-to-read, and easy-to-understand account of the Dutch merchant ship, Batavia, which was wrecked on a coral archipelago off the western coast of Ausstralia in 1629. In addition to it's cargo, the Batavia carried nearly 300 men, women, and children. The story of the Batavia covers 59 pages, which was enough for me. For anyone interested in a more detailed account of the tragedy of the Batavia, the author recommends the work of Mike Dash, the author of ""Batavia's Graveyard"" which was published in 2002.Because I truly enjoy stories of the sea, I also enjoyed the second part of the book which is a personal essay about the author's 1958 summer experience as a crew member aboard Prosper, one of the last of the sail-driven tuna-fishing boats from Brittany. An experienced sailor myself, I can appreciate the thrill of a fishing boat actually working while being powered soley by the wind."
1,Brenner's right,"My sentiments exactly, Scott Brenner. To buy a $20 (retail) book and immediately read, ""Oh, you shouldn't have bothered..."" is dismaying. And then to find that it is about the length of a typical Atlantic Monthly article (under $5, plus you get the rest of the excellent magazine as well) is infuriating. At that, the book would be nothing but a matchbook-thick pamphlet if it weren't padded with pages containing maybe 50 words of text here and there. Bummer.Stephan Wilkinson"
1,a worthless little read,"This is a small thin book that isn't worth buying, not even at a discounted price. When the author repeatedly tells you that you should be reading a different book on the subject, an earlier more complete one, you should take him at his word and not read this little thing. The Batavia half is over too soon and the second half of the book has nothing to do with the Batavia. It's about the author sailing on a ship called the Prosper. I would suggest that a potential reader should try some internet postings about the Batavia wreck, and then, if interested, do what the author suggests: read Mike Dash's better book instead."
2,Too much for too little,"With some good photos or art work this very short story could have been turned into a passable article for National Geographic. Although a bit longer than a Doctor Suess story, quite a bit too short for a $14 hardcover book. Pass on it and buy the Mike Dash book on the topic. I wish I had."
1,Hair metal,"LOUDNESS signed with a major company and immediately sold out, dressing themselves like Dokken, POison, Cinderella, Motley Crue, whatever. Accordingly, the music quality dropped sharply, and they lost whatever chance they have of one day being really great.HURRICANE EYES is simply awful."
5,Masters of eastern Metal!,"All I can say is WOW. I am a huge fan of Loudness and have followed their career since 1983. Any true lover of Metal music and especially old school Metal (as opposed to Nu Metal) has to have this album, a definite must if you're a collector and appreciate good music"
4,Another Solid Effort,"Akira is a shredder and their orginal vocalists difficultly with english was part of their charm! Get this album, it is very similar to 'Lighting' and 'Thunder'! Great riffs, and catchy songs!"
3,"Some Good, Some Bad","Hurricane Eyes could have been a great album. The music is there, but the bad sound and akward vocals bring this down a few notches. It does not compare to Thunder in the east, (The underrated) lightning strikes, or even Soldier of fortune. It is better than the terrible, On The Prowel. High notes include S.D.I., This lonely heart (sick riff), Take Me home, and rock this way. Low points, The keyboards and bad backround vocals on rock n roll gypsy. The lowest of all lows comes at the end, in a bad song, ""So lonely"". Where did this crap come from.Loudness was a great band, this was not up to their standards."
3,"Good album,but not for fans of Loudness's early material","I have always considered Loudness to be Japan's answer to Dokken and Judas Priest.There is some good material on here,but this album is the most poppy sounding one that they had made at that time.""In my dreams"" and ""rock and roll gypsy"" are definite skipover tracks.""This Lonely Heart"" has a great opening with great guitar riffs,but quickly drops off after that.The rest of the songs are decent but overall,this album will not set your world on fire.I recommend the two previous albums,Lightning Strikes and Thunder in the East if want to hear this band's best American released material,although their best material is on the early eighties Japanese import albums which contain no pop at all and are'nt so grossly overproduced like the later releases."
1,The worst of metal in the eighties !!!,""" Hurricane Eyes "" is a clear example of the worst that metal in the 80's could bring to the public, which eventually led to this genre downfall through the 90's. Wasting the talents of a clearly guifted guitarrist, Akira Takasaki, trying to making sucess in the USA, like bands like Dokken, Ratt and million others. When Loudness sang in Japanese (on their first records) that was pure 80's metal, with creativity and cohesion in their music. In this album, they're just a joke."
5,Love it !!!,"Growing up in the 80's these guys were never appreciated, but I listened and loved it as much as the Crue, Ozzy, Ratt or Metallica, Akira Tamasaki is as good at ripping solos and chords as anyone else of the time, If you missed the boat in the 80's try this album out,!!!"
5,Gift,"I purchased this book for my brother in law as a gift! He is really into boxing and was so excited to receive it, after he read it he told me it was the perfect gift he loved it."
2,Disappointed,"I've always admired and respected Bert Sugar for his intelligent and often humorous analyst of boxing history and the great fighters of the past, however, I must sadly say this book was terrible. Aside from an occasional comical quote or commit the book was simply silly and insulting to any boxing aficionado. For example, Bert actually ranked Joe Frazier higher than Carlos Monzon and Marvelous Marvin Hagler in this publication. He did this despite the fact that Carlos Monzon and Hagler were vastly more dominate fighters in their eras as well as having far longer and more glorious title reigns. Also his decision to not include all-time greats such as Lennox Lewis and Michael Spinks was ridiculous especially when you take into consideration some of the fighters that did make the list. Overall, this book is a mediocre read that offers information on many turn of century fighters but I wouldn't recommend it for any serious boxing fan."
2,Arrived busted.,"Speaker was ripped out when it arrived. Amazon refunded.I did drill new holes and mounted the speaker back down. The ""wood"" this unit is made of appears to be some sort of cardboard based material, or it is the worst MDF I have ever seen. The speaker and wiring is all pretty wimpy, but it does put out fair bass, but it is dirty, muddled bass. If you are on a total budget, I guess it is OK.I replaced it with the Pioneer TS-SWX251 for a little over $100 and am much happier. It takes up much less space and sounds much better."
2,sub-woofer,"this subwoofer sounds really good when you connect it to a 100 watt amp but if you go hyer than that its going to blow. i connected mine to a 500 watt amp and it blew in about 20 min. Im not really to mad about it because i had another 10"" woofer in my house so i just unscrewed the one that it came with and put my sub in to the box and it sounds great."
4,The Horrible Dr. Bones isn't too horrible at all.,"This is a surprisingly entertaining and inventive zombie tale with strong performances, a campy comic book style to it, and nifty FX. The music used to pad the film isn't too shabby either. My only complaint was that the zombies were too simplistic. There was no make-up on the actors who played the zombies at all with the exception of bloody, stiched up eyes (which are covered with dark sunglasses most of the time anyway). There are two exceptions to this though. There is one scene where a zombie has a nasty, bloody face, and another one with a big bloody hole in his chest. Also, every now and then for no explained reason, Dr. Bones (who isn't a zombie) has a nasty scarred face which is pretty impressive.Bottom line: A good watch."
1,One of the worst movies in the world!,This movie is very poor. The only good thing about this movie is one song which is used to turn people into zombies. The plot is simple... The special effects are very poor. Do not buy or rent it. The acting is very poor. Bad script and poor acting make this moviebelow sci fi B movies.
3,"1 Monument, 1 Souvenir and the rest is filler.","He Was Really Saying Something is a great song. It is Motown at it's happiest. The Bananrama version, which was my first introduction to this song, is so lame compared to the original. The other good cut is Needle In A Haystack. A great Martha and the Vandelas style romp. The rest of this collection is second shelf. I do love Motown."
4,40 years later...,"A compilation of the works of a sadly under-appreciated and little recognized Motown girl group. This disc contains 15 (16 if you count the ""hidden track"") tunes including the two that managed to crack the pop top-100 in the mid-60's. This group had much more potential than the powers at Motown chose to develop. Had they been given the material and attention a la the Marvelettes or Martha and the Vandellas, their name would be equally as recognizable today. The possibilities are evident in the Norman Whitfield-penned ""Needle In A Haystack"" and ""He Was Really Saying Something"". If you're a Motown fan and would like something beyond the ubiquitous super-girl-group material, this is an excellent find.The sound quality is typically Motown - sometimes muddy and harsh and the entire disc is in mono but that in itself doesn't negate the enjoyment of hearing these hard-to-find sides."
4,So Sadly Overlooked!,"Was it because they always ended up getting songs that Motown's bigger-name girl groups passed on? Was it because Cal Gill's voice, so chameleon-like, sounded by turns like Brenda Holloway, then like Martha Reeves, depending on the material? Was it because of inadequate promotion? Whatever the reason, the Velvelettes never attained the stardom they so richly deserved. (Perhaps it is for this very reason that the original members still perform as a group today, not torn apart by petty diva jealousies!) Anyway, here is a truly great sampling of their recorded output. Well remastered, annotated and packaged, this CD is a long-overdue testament to the talent so long overlooked. I defy anyone to keep still while listening to ""Needle in a Haystack,"" or ""He Was Really Sayin' Somethin'."" Incidentally, even today, the gals look and sound as good, or better, than they did 30 years ago. And THAT's sayin' somethin'!"
5,Kenda K-Rad Standard tires,Used to upgrade a 1954 Schwinn cruiser. These tires don't appear any larger than a 26x2.125 despite being labeled a 26x 2.300. They fit fine and allow up to 80 PSI inflation pressures for lower rolling resistance so I can think about riding the old girl farther with less exertion. The tread pattern is a good all around design and looks close to the old brick pattern Schwinn used back in the day.
3,"There, Ok","These tires came on my BMX bike and worked well for a while. The tread quickly ran down and I some who managed to tare the tire. I'm just a beginner and don't do extreme tricks, but I wish they would have lasted longer. It is possible that it is something that I did, but it is unlikely. I will not be buying one of these tires again."
5,Great Stands,These are substantial without adding shot or sand. The spikes add stability on my carpet. The look just like the pictures. I'm really happy with these.
3,"interesting, though not clearly objective","Mooney's study is often fascinating, although one has to wonder how objective and disinterested someone can be who refers to his subject as ""this pathetic cult."""
2,If you missed it...,"If you were absent during the one-week unit on creative writing in your eighth grade English class, this book is for you. It is that simple and that simplistic. Don't bother with this one unless you are a complete non-writer who only wishes to get a few little memory pieces in readable -- but not publishable -- form."
2,First Lessons,"Even though this book covers all the basics, I don't like the style. It is very concise and is more suitable for older aspiring artist. I bought this for my 8 year old and it was too wordy for her."
1,If you believe in evolution...,"I was looking for a book on gout. Honestly, Dealing with Gout for Dummies was what I wanted, but that title doesn't exist. This book was recommended. What a waste. If you believe in evolution and want to hear all kinds of unproved theories in that area, this is the book for you. If, however, you are looking for honest, substantiated, and useful information, go somewhere else."
4,Good 'Power Pop en Espanol',"Pastilla's ""Vox Electra"" was a pleasant surprise. This is some great power pop en Espanol from a Mexican-American LA quartet. If you are a fan of Jellyfish or XTC and are open-minded, pick this album up."
3,pleasant,"a charming little album featuring breezy acoustic numbers with gentle female vocals. the covers of ""Friday I'm In Love"" (The Cure) and ""Crazy Town"" (Velocity Girl) are particularly nice. and the original ""Travelogue"" stands out as a great little song. ""Glimmer"" is recommended for fans of Belle & Sebastian or Magnetic Fields. although not as quirky or twee as either of those two bands, Glo-worm seems to share a common thread of pop charm that would appeal to their fans."
2,Noisy!,"I purchased this pump to recycle water through a solar heater for my swimming pool. It is junk as far as I am concerned. It is noisy beyond belief! Especially for something so tiny. Unless you are going to use this far, far away, try another product!"
3,Decent little pump,I bought this pump to help drain my rain barrels. It has descent pressure but not great. I stick a small sprinkler on the end of it and water the grass for 15 minutes at a time. I had to buy a garden hose female/female brass adapter since both inlet and outlet are males. Take care and heed the duty cycles. It will get warm/hot and it needs to cool down after use. It has a little wine to it when in use but it's not too noisy.
5,Awesome,"One of the best country albums I have ever heard. Every song is a hit and let me tell you, Buddy can sing. Whether it's a ballad or up tempo its just awesome. Trust me if you buy this CD you won't be disappointed."
5,awesome cd but its hard to buy,this is a awesome cd but i have trouble to buy this cd i cannot buy it in the music here or at walmark or zellare i dont now why it is so hard to buy into stores and there is other country stars i also know hard to buy thank u mike miller
4,The War Of Words Is Over!,Great dvd! The TUF season 12 really built up the fight between Koscheck and GSP. The big question was could Koscheck KO GSP like Serra did? GSP had other ideas and put on one of his best performances to date. This is definitely worth watching for GSP's perfomance in the stand up. Not the best card on paper but had some good finishes. wwwdotufclatestdotcom
3,"Good, but do not watch if you offended by nudity","This was a very interesting and different documentary.It is a diary-like account of a photographer who solicites and photographs people nude across the country in 48 states. He does not pay the models. Only offers a copy of their picture for posing. There are posings on individuals and also large groups in various settings. One picture was with 1,123 people in the group pose.It was an interesting approach to nude photograpgy. Worth watching."
3,Very Well Done & Enjoyable,I really enjoyed watching this documentary - it was well done and quite funny in parts. Lots of interesting behind the scenes bits.
3,Naked States,"I bought this because my wife remembered seeing this and recommended I get it. If you're into the nude body as an art form, this might be your cup of tea, but to me seeing all those naked bodies lying around as if they were dead struck me as rather bizarre. But at least the behind-the-scenes stories of Mr. Tunick's adventures are somewhat interesting."
1,"Nudies, Nudies, everywhere.","This flick if not weird, then definitely different ? Lacks any plan or purpose ? If curiosity gets the best of the viewer at the end of the flick, and the question flashes through the minds, ""Why did this film get made in the first place ? One answer might be,the film producer is addicted to wall to wall birthday suits ? This flick defies reason, logic, purpose and plot, but its definitely not porm !"
4,Nice little Strummer memento,"While this isn't a must have title, it certainly is good listening. It shows Joe's diversity as a musician and his knowledge of all sorts of arrangements like brass, strings and percussion. Most of the songs are of latin flavor and all of it is acoustic. This isn't anything like Joe has done before so don't expect anything familiar. My favorite tracks are ""Smash Everything,"" ""Tropic of Pico,"" and ""Musket Waltz."""
5,Joe said it was his best.,"It was an interview in his later years, and he was asked to recall his favorite work.He said it was an album one couldn't even buy anymore.Kudos to Astralwerks for the re-release.It would've been nice if they had used the overdubs in the movie to accompanying the end title theme on the elpee.I have not heard the re-issue and am looking forward to the bonus remixes. I received the vinyl version when it was released, and it was extremely difficult to get back once it was loaned. Yet, it is one of those things one takes pleasure in when loaning."
1,Not really a new album!!!,"If you already own most of the Gipsy Kings CD's this one is a waste of money. Other than a single (unremarkable) cut, nothing on this CD is either new or obviously remastered. Save your money."
4,Great pads,"These pads, once they've been bedded in (which takes around 1K miles), do a very good job. I used these on both the front and rear of my '95 BMW 740i, and I'm quite happy with the performance. I replaced the rotors with cheap Centric non-drilled non-slotted rotors, and they still work very well with my ""enthusiastic"" driving. They seem to be creating a lot of dust, but I've only used them for a couple thousand miles so far; that could be a result of the bedding process. Never the less, I've used EBC Green Stuff on other large cars (such as my Grand Marquis and Tahoe) recently, but will probably be switching to Hawk pads next time I need to replace my pads on those cars.The one star deducted is for the relatively high (but not unreasonable) initial amount of dust. I'll post a follow-up later on if I remember."
4,"Good book, kids love it","I'd have given it a 5 if it was as good as Thumpity Thump Gets Dressed but since it seems a little weaker, I give it a 4. I may be biased since my daughter likes Thumpity better!That said, all of these series of her books are excellent. The art is the real draw, it's well done, it's pleasant, and the little ones just seem drawn to it. Isn't that the point of a children's book?Matt"
5,Great crochet for kids!,"This book was full of great crochet for kids, with well written instructions. Full color pictures of each project really inspired me, and I've already created several of the outfits for my grandchildren. Excellent addition to any crocheter's library, and a super gift for anyone who enjoys crochet."
3,Little disappointed . . . We'll see,"The descriptions and ratings of the book made me think the designs would be cuter than they are. For the most part, the designs look like old fashioned bathing costumes with a couple cute hats, done in single crochet. Before I got the book, I was all fired up to make something for my daughter, but I don't like the way the outfits look on the kids in the photos. Truthfully, not my taste at all. I suppose the pattern simplicity has something to do with kicking the jumpsuits out before the child outgrows them. Even so, the outlined construction process looks long and tedious for an outfit that might be worn a half dozen times or less. Unless you crochet like the wind and like old fashioned, fugly clothes, this probably isn't the book for you."
1,boring,"If you're into redesigning patterns, you'll love this book... If you want it all spelled out for you, you probly won't. The problem with this book is (like with MANY other books coming out right now) is that it seems all to be single crochet with no variations. I've noticed this in the women's sweater books also. I think the pattern makers think we're stupid, and are trying to give us something we can actually DO, I dunno.I am finding I can use the patterns and a designing crochet book ( a book of stitch variations) and I get some nice things out of it this way.There are some interesting uses of trims here."
2,Major issue with compatiability,This fan says it works with a whole slew of Dell Systems.However I was using a Dell Dimension 1100 and the plug that goes into the motherboard for the Fan was only three prongs where the slot on the motherboard was four.I could get the fan to plug in (by a jamming it) and the fan would work. However the system would always prompt a FAN FAILURE during EVERY boot up. Annoying!!! Double check and re-check computer compatibility before buying this fan.
1,"Good product, bad seller","This is an exact replacement for the fan in my Dell Dimension 2400. Unfortunately the seller does not provide any instructions, and during replacement I damaged the small rubber couplings that hold the fan in place. This is a tricky operation and the seller should provide a simple instruction sheet."
2,Mathmatical Ideas,"This book is titled with the MathXL tutorials on CD. I bought the book brand new, believing that the CD came with. IT DOES NOT! It was very misleading of amazon and an inconvenience to me. I couldn't do my math homework for over a week due to the fact that shipping was insanely slow and then the order was not what was expected. Don't buy this book here if you need the CD or access code otherwise it cost an extra $50 from the publisher for it."
1,School,"This book was mandated for us to have in school. Really to bulky, not enough introductions to the topics. I did not care for it's practice format, it needed more of breakdown guideline."
1,Do not buy anything from this seller.,I ordered mathematical ideas from this seller and I waited three weeks for this book to come in. After the estimated shipping arrival date passed i contacted amazon for a refund. It has been over a month and the product never showed up. Thankfully amazon granted me a full refund but I had to drive an hour to check the book out from a library and spent a lot of time and money finding the book. The positive reviews before this one were very misleading and i wish i would have known to expect such poor service. So now consider yourself warned.
3,Missing pieces.,"Everything was great. The only issue, and the biggest one; was that the seller used false advertisement. She said the Math XL disk came with it. When I got the package there was no disk, and there was a comment on the paper saying it did not come with the Math XL disk. This contradicted the seller's title which said that the book came with the disk, and why it was $20 more than the books that I could have purchased without it."
3,A Ok...,The book came quickly and was in ok condition (even though it was supposed to be in good condition) I'm not picky so the book condition was not important to me beings as it gets the job done.
2,adequate for it's intended use,"This book would have been much more useful had it had done a better job of providing clear examples when introducing new material. One advantage of this book was that it could be used for more than one math class, thus cutting down of the student's costs."
5,Can't beat it for cost and free ship with Prime,I was very hesitant to buy these considering they are mostly glass. These were out of stock but came back in stock within 5 days and were shipped for arrival 2 days after with Prime. Important note: the boxes are HEAVY. I managed by myself but carrying up stairs was tough I had to slide/push it up. The assembly and instructions were very simple - I had no issue and no parts were missing. The hardest part to assemble was putting the door on at the end of assembly. The end result is a quality case that looks great and I got 2 delivered for less than the cost of one of these at most stores. Highly recommend.
1,"Horrible product, horrible company","This was a terrible product that I gave as a gift to my fiancee. He immediately tried to assemble it and the instructions were horrible and we finally determined that we were missing some of the parts since the feet could not be assembled with the base as it was. He is an engineer and deal with far more complicated issues everyday. When we contacted the company about this they said they would send new feet and screws for attachment. We waited two weeks with nothing before calling again. Once we received them, and they didn't work either, we just tried to report the serious assembly problems to any product engineer and get a return label and full refund for this awful product.If you want something in similar quality but probably more reliable customer service, go to IKEA-you can buy two like this that are better looking anyway!"
2,Why is this sooo expensive???????,Please someone answer me this.....why is this glass cabinet soooo expensive?????? its only glass and a few rods!!!!!!!!this is not the best product
4,Perfect for your collectibles,Length:: 4:18 Mins-ProsPerfect for display of your collectiblesSolid tempered glass-ConsCheaply made compressed fiber board top and bottomInstructions need an upgrade
5,Very Happy with Glass Curio Cabinet,"I am very pleased with my contemporary glass curio cabinet. It was very helpful reading the prior reviews before I purchased the cabinet. The cabinet is very heavy, however the company does an excellent job with the packing. Therefore, none of the pieces were damaged.I recommend if you are going to put the cabinet together by yourself, that you put the cabinet together where you are going to place it. Instructions are not very clear, however, once I realized the top from the bottom, it was very easy to put together. I found it was easier to lay the bottom on the side when putting in the poles and then stand up when putting on the top. Ensure the poles holes are lined up inside for when you are placing in the glass shelfs. Look for four very small holes on the bottom."
3,Decent piece,"Awful directions. You better look really hard and long before you start putting it together. There are no words to help you only diagrams and they are not super clear. Typical of a cheap Asian made product. Wood or so called wood looks fairly cheap, glass is high quality though and piece looks much better put together than in pieces where you wonder if you made a big mistake purchasing it. If I had paid more than $145 for it I would have been mad. IKEA sells a Detolf curio that is as high of quality and looks a little better for only $65 but the nearest store from me is 170 miles away."
3,Good player but doesn't work as advertised,"If you're looking for a great portable CD-player, there's no reason why you shouldn't get this one. The styling is nice, the controls easy to use, the remote control is highly convienent and the sound is good. But the 40 second anti-shock function and the ""jogger case"" are useless if you're actually going to try jogging with this thing. I wasn't ten steps out the door before it started skipping like a broken record. I tried tightening the straps and closing the case as tightly and firmly as possible, and that worked wonders--until I got halfway down the block when it started skipping again. If you want a good player, go ahead, but don't expect miracles."
3,"Good CD player, but not loud enough","I used this CD player for a couple of weeks, and almost everything about it is great. It seems well made, the battery life is excelent (I'm still on the first set of batteries), and the jog case is very effective.However, the CD player is not very loud, even at max volume. When I go to the gym, I can clearly hear the television over the music from the cd player.If you are going the listen to this cd player in a quiet environment, with no sounds around you, it's probably a good buy. Otherwise, I'd look elsewhere. I'm returning mine today."
3,Enjoyable enough for a book-based film,"Just knowing the film was based off of a Peretti book was reason enough for me to watch ""Hangman's Curse"". If you expect this movie to be like the book, you will likely be disappointed.It's a good enough thriller while it lasts. Although I found the acting a little awkward, the makers did a good enough job in adapting this book to a movie.If you enjoy Frank's writing, this is a fun movie to sit down to. Oh, yeah, and when you watch it keep your eye out for the scientist... 'cause Frank himself stars in this film."
2,AIR BUDDY AND SPY KIDS AFTER SCHOOL SPECIAL,"I had high hopes for this to be a creepy thriller but it had more of an after school special feel to it. This movie is geared towards younger audiences and I would hope that someone older than 21 might get something out of it but likely not. The eccentric forensic scientist was annoying and the scene where the first kid gets decontaminated was laughable. In a far fetched twist to the plot, the real threat shifts from devil worshipers to an invasion of big spiders. The nuclear family and their crime solving dog was just a little too perfect for me."
3,Hangman's Curse,"I bought this movie because my daughter saw it around Halloween time with her youth group at church. We borrowed it so I could watch it since it is based on a suicide at at high school. Didn't know how appropriate it was. I did watch it with her and it is a ""suspense"" movie and wasn't that bad. Could be scary for young kids or those terrified of spiders! My daughter and all the kids at youth group (grades 6-12) loved it."
3,Not bad.,I gave this movie a 3 comparing it to secular films. Would probably bump it up to a 4 if compared to Christian films. My kids age 13 and 15 enjoyed it (enough). Good family film. Not too scary. Felt like a Scooby-Doo mystery to me. Bought it to show to our youth group at church. Not sure if I will - 50/50 right now on that idea. I think my kids liked it more than I did since most of the actors were teens and it was set in a high school atmosphere.
2,Needs more,"Okay for starters let me just say that Christain movie do have a low budget, but that is no excuse. It was an awful movie, not faithful to the book at all (oh yeah Frank Peretti the author, was in the movie!)!!! There is no one part that was entirely faithful. It was such a good book I was expecting so much more from the movie. I mean they had about 5 seconds devoted to one of the coolest parts in the book (non-climax related), and they even screwed that up! Wrong characters and everything. I mean the actors were good, but they should have followed the book more. Let's just say, if you're going to make a book into a movie do it well or don't do it at all."
3,Exciting plot but doesn't hang together,"The characters are well drawn and acted (except for the scientist - much too over the top and frankly unbelievable). It is an excellent portrayal, however, of the results of bullying and the effects of ignoring it. Some may quibble that the goths and pseudo Satanists are stereotypes but that complaint is minor. I do take issue, however, with the plot device of the play ""The Hangman"" which is being produced by the school. As a teacher, I find it hard to believe that any school which suspects the occult and has a history of a student who hanged himself would never allow such a production to continue. The video will appeal to those who are looking for horror with a Christian theme."
5,"wow...i mean, wow","Dude. I'm glad this wasn't in theatre. It would've been so...I don't know, worn out? It's so good. I'll admit, it's not exactly oscar worthy, but it's entertaining. Jake Richardson is hot, I might add. It's a teenage ""thriller,"" and I think everyone can relate to at least one of the characters. In a way it's kind of like John Hughes meets Hitchcock - some may say ""hey, that's my school!"" while still having a horror twist. I'm a huge John Hughes fan, but I'll admit it's no Hitchcock. Hitchcock had a certain style, but that's something completely different.Bottom line: it's a teenage horror film and fun to watch. GO SEE IT. Jake Richardson is HOT."
3,Okay movie,"This moive was okay. I was expecting more, after all the author was in the movie. I watched the extra with him in it, and he said that the film was more than he could imagine, but I don't agree. The ending was really the only part that they kept entirely true to the book, and while that is the best part it was still a disapointment. I would reccomend the book over the movie, however, if one hadn't read the book then they would probably think this movie was great."
2,The book is far better,There's little I can say to recommend this movie to you other than the fact that the book is great. The movie takes a complex and entertaining book with well-thought out Christian themes and over-simplifies both its plot and moral story. Please don't judge the book by this DVD!
1,Hangman's Curse is Bad Filmmaking,"Frank Peretti should stick to his day job of writing b-grade Christian horror novels. His presence as an actor in Hangman's Curse ruins an otherwise B-grade after-school-special-esque film. His acting is so bad it causes unintentional laughter. The movie is full of stereotypes and bad acting. The plot is preposterous and illogical. And of course there is the big Christian message of ""Jesus loves me"" in the end scene. This movie is badly acted produced and directed, and is not worth 101 minutes of your time. Christians need to learn to make better films without overt agendas and bad acting, or the whole genre will suffer. And again, anyone who let's Frank Peretti act in a movie of his own B-grade novel should be damned to hell for all eternity."
4,Hangman's Curse Good Movie PG-13,"Abel Frye, a troubled teen accused of stabbing a young girl to death, committed suicide in what is, ten years later, known as the `forbidden wing'. Ten years later, students at Rogers High School believe the spirit of the tormented teen returns, as students on the football team begin to see hallucinations of the dead pupil. Nate and Sarah Springfield and their two teenage children go undercover to solve the mystery claiming the students in the school with a deadly force that can only end in tragedy, after finding out you can not annihilate what you cannot come across.This high school thriller has an important message underneath its mystery, and has a positive outcome viewers can all enjoy.I enjoyed this movie and its conflict, as well as the bravery of the two undercover teenagers. This movie is rated PG-13 for elements of violence, terror, and brief drug material."
4,Wonderful film with moving ending!,"Well, the movie wasn't exactly the best, but, it is among my favorites. I feel this movie did a very good job with twists and turns throughout the movie which keep you guessing. More importantly to me is the issue of high school stereotypes. I was labeled as a ""goth"" at my old high school because I chose to dress in black clothes, listen to heavier music, find pleasure in being alone, and watching horror survival movies. Stereotypes are something that really shouldn't exist. Everyone should just be themselves and that's all there is to it. I won't give away the end of this movie, but, it practically drove me to tears when I seen it."
2,Poor presentation,"When I orginally got this movie I thought it was going to be a horror movie. Maybe a B horror film at it's worst. This movie would have been ok if I was watching it on an ""Afternoon Special"" and I was 13 years old again at it's best. I also didn't think that this movie would have had Christian undercurrents as well. It would have been ok if it would have said that on the back of the DVD and I would not have watched it. I was very disappointed in this movie."
4,Project 65,"I thought Hangman's Curse was a good movie. It displayed a Christian message without being preachy. The main characters were believable. Can't blame the girl for wanting a boyfriend. I hope Mr. Peretti produces a film of Nightmare Academy.Incidentally, Hangman's Curse contains a few parallels to my novel Under the Blood. This novel features Gil Leduc who finds his good friend Paul Connors dead in a field on the way to school. Paul, who had once been strong in his relationship with God, had recently joined the Black Ravens, a satanic gang."
1,Simplistic and embarrassing to watch,"Some time back, I was handed a tract by a well-meaning Evangelical Christian. Unfortunately, the tract was inappropriate aside from the fact that I didn't invite that kind of conversation with this total stranger. The tract was so full of stereotypes, straw-man arguments, and childish scare tactics (little pictures of souls gnashing their teeth that they hadn't committed to Jesus before they died) that it made me wonder if Christians just check their brains at the door when they go into church.And then there's this DVD. While it's tempting to be offended by the stealth marketing (I wouldn't knowingly have paid money to be preached to), I actually found myself embarrassed for the people who made the movie. It reveals a lot more about the insecurities of the moviemakers than it does any spiritual truths. The real message of the movie? Christians can be cool, too. As long as they don't think too much."
1,The worst I've seen in last five years...,"People, save your money...find better way to spend two hours, especially if you are older than 5 years.Compared to this movie, Spy Kids (all three parts) are real Master-piece."
1,Generic,"I call this ""Mainstream Generic"", no different then other ""Nutritionist"" that are mainstream. Just telling you when to eat, and some basic numbers. Athletes need to know detail specifics."
3,Why did they cut alot off the DVD of Divas 99,I Have this DVD but I also tape it off the tv. The DVD is missing a lot on it I like my version better because I also have Tina Turner singing Let's Stay Together.ThanksSandy Comper
3,Vh1 Cut's Out Best from Video,"Vh1 cut out the best from this video. Although it is still a good video of the concert and Tina Turner and Whitney Houston sing their hearts out, VH1 cut out two of Whitney's hits and totally cut out Cher's new hit, Believe. Cher is a Diva in her own right. Who care's about Brandy and Mary J. Blidge. The hightlight is Tina Turner and Whitney singing ""I will always Love You"". Forgive me if I've misspelled or uncorrectly stated the names of these songs. J. Smith, Los Angeles, CA."
5,Three DivaS,"It is a pity the entire show did not make it to this DVD. However, for those of us who are fans of Tina Turner and Whitney Houston, when their indivigual segments appear, trust me, they literally own the stage and crowd.Whitney's duet with Mary J. Blige was fantastic. I Will Always Love You was over the top. When all the Divas came together to sing I'm Every Woman, Whitney was the best of them all.Tina Turner's segment, especially with Elton John, rocked the building.The other Divas who appeared, were no match for Whitney and Tina."
2,BOOO THIS IS NOT RIGHT!,"I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS DVD FOR ONE REASON......EDITING!!! WHY WOULD YOU PUT THE CONCERT ON DVD IF YOU WERE GONNA CUT IT DOWN?!? I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF A DVD, SO IT COULD SHOW ALOT MORE AND NOT BE SQUISHED DOWN INTO 60 MINTUES ON VHS. THERE ARE SEVERAL COMMENTARIES AND PERFORMANCES THAT ARE MISSING FROM THIS FEATURE INCLUDING: TINA TURNER'S PERFORMANCE OF ""LETS STAY TOGETHER"", AND ALSO TWO OF WHITNEY'S PERFORMANCES ""ITS NOT RIGHT, BUTS ITS OKAY"" AND ""YOUR LOVE IS MY LOVE(or the other way around)"". I SPECIFICALLY BOUGHT THIS DVD FOR THE 'IT'S NOT RIGHT' PERFORMANCE AND OTHER REASONS, AND TO THINK THAT THEY WOULD CUT OUT TINA!?!?!? TINA TURNER AND WHITNEY HOUSTON BROUGHT THE FIRE AND EXCITEMENT TO THE SHOW THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE PAINFULLY BORING. BUT THEY DO SHINE WHILE THEY'RE THERE."
4,Best Music DVD so far,"I bought lots of music DVD. This one is much better than the others for the sound quality crips and clear, just like sitting in a live concert (except for the 2 commercial breaks). Every Divas are great and fun, although Cher voice was off key a little, but her dresses have compensated that part.Tina Turner and Whiney Houston are the highlights of the event.Except that the DVD was quite short (a little over an hour) I have nothing more to complain about."
4,DIVAS OH OK,"I ordered the tape version. I must say I was disappointed that Whitneys songs were edited. Its not right, and others. Tina did an excellent job with proud MARY. She proves age is just a number. Turner is a Diva indeed! Brandy what was going on there, she was terrible. And really shouldn't of performed if she had a sore throat. But to me she sounded the same as she always have. Having Cher come out to Tinas song wasn't a good ideal. Tina could of handle that by her self. People were jumping up, hopefully for not Chers lip singing. Mary J. Blige i'm not a big fan of hers, she did alot of screaming. Whitney could of done that song much better alone. Faith Hill is ok she came out to help Brandy who needed it. Leann is a stunning young lady, and she'll get even more better with time. Whitneys I will always love you was great. Though she could of done better. See her performance at the Artisa 25th celebration. She really did an excellent job. Chaka please to much yelling with i'm every woman."
2,Poor Show,"In the first place, why was Brandy in it?! They should've billed Mary J. Blige instead of her. Her performance was weak. Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, & Elton John further dragged the event down. The show is about Divas, ok? Hill & Rimes are NOT, although Elton can pass for a diva. Tina was ""Simply The Best."" Cher is NOT a diva. She can't even sing live, for crying out loud! As for Whitney, I was disappointed because she gave a so-so performance. Her ""I Will Always Love You"" number was mediocre. Her voice is weakening and it showed a lot in this concert. All in all, the show was boring. It's about Divas. The only Diva that night was Tina Turner. Houston, maybe, if she sang better. The show paled in comparison with Divas Live 1998."
1,Do Not Buy,"Do not buy this item. I bought this for my mom two years ago for Christmas. After only a year and a half the laser died and in order to fix the unit it would cost $185. When I talked to the electronics repairman he said that he gets that a lot with these Panasonic home theater systems. There is no way this should be happening, but after talking to the repairman I am obviously not the only one who has had this happen."
5,Excellent Movie,"It's not about being gay..or a gay movie...it's all about love....I was amazed by this great story. As a person who really disregarded homosexual....this movie has changed my attitudes toward the homosexual commununity... this movie is A+ and should have won the Best Picutre Award, instead of CRASH."
5,best of 2005,"Simply the best film of 2005, and that was quite a strong year in films. It's hard now to separate the political influences and media hype that have surrounded this picture from the beginning. But try, and you will be rewarded with a moving experience that will stay with you for a long time. I think many people are put off by Ang Lee's slow and deliberate style. We are not used to strong character development and staying in the quiet moments. However, Lee's masterful style fully brings to life the people in Annie Proulx's famous short story. Heath Ledger, Michelle Williams, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway are all magnificent in their portrayals. The acting is true, and never feels melodramatic or cliched. And finally the fantastic music! Gustavo Santaolalla's score is so achingly spare and beautiful, wonderfully evoking the mood of the film."
1,Brokeback Mountain DVD,"One of the more lousy movies out there. It is always interesting to see how non-cowboy/western people believe everything Hollywood puts out there for viewers who believe their spin on things of which the general public know little to nothing about. Perhaps, these viewers believe these fallacies because this is what they want to believe instead of beliefs based on unbiased facts. That being said, the large majority of ""cowboy"" representation in this movie is a farce. I mean really, what is Hollywood after here? Reality based on facts is certainly not being represented in this rendition."
2,boring movie,"kinda boring storyline, not much seems to happen. plus the eye candy was covered most of the time, few short nude scenes."
1,Brokeback DVD,"""ERROR ON DISK"" I expected a two-DVD set in the jewel case but there was only one. It had no label, as though it was not professionally burned. It was cheap and it would not play. This is another instance where the more expensive item may be the lowest quality."
3,not a 5 star movie!,"I'm not sure why people are giving this 5 stars because BB definitely doesn't deserve that.On the other hand, many that gave it 1 star (also undeserved) seemed to expect some action movie or blatant plot twist(s). I was expecting something else, too, but found an elusive, though present, ""plot"" presented in a minimalistic style.It's set in the early 60s, so complaints about the characters ""responsability"" aren't really relevant. I suppose one must have been alive then or be acutely knowledgable about the era to compltely understand this aspect of the film.BB is not a bad movie and, to it's credit, had me thinking about the story long after I left the theater (unlike most of today's Hollywood offerings). 3 stars."
5,Goodbye Larrikan,It's a sad time for us here in Australia. Heath was a true blue aussie larrikan and will be sadly missed.R.I.P. Heath.
5,IF ONLY THIS WAS TRUE,"I was expecting a Queer As Folk kinda drama to happen in this film and also was ready to walk out of the movie theatre but boy was I wrong. I mean these guys had, what they think was one night stand and nothing more. Years later, they met and the feelings they have for each other became stronger and hard to break, even it had to be that way at the end in order to follow society's policies and procedures and save their marriage. I believe and know that there are some people out there in this same situation(DL, as some will call it) but the thing is love comes in different forms and shapes. I love the moive and will watch it over and over again. Wonderful flick"
5,Better than I thought.,Saw it in the theater and was a bit let down. Then saw it again on DVD and thought it was pretty great. Depressing but great.
5,broke back mountain,came in at expected time. works great. brand new factory sealed. perfect condition. plays great.
5,Ending Song is wrong,"I have loved this movie since it first came out--acting, scenery, plot. One thing has bugged me though. For a good production, they let it go out with what I consider a major mispronounciation in the ending song. Maybe only a westerner would know, but the word in ""get along little dogie"" is pronounced with a long o--it means stray calf. The singer says doggie, which is wrong."
2,Heath Ledger,"The item was as described, I was happy with my purchase and would buy from this seller again through Amazon. I must say I didn't like the movie but my wife did and she is the one who made me purchase it."
2,Not the first or the best,"This is not the first movie with a gay love story as the theme and it is not the best. The first true gay love story I saw was a wonderful movie called Big Eden. It was much better than this movie in its story telling. Brokeback is about a violent and sordid gay relationship. It is a beautifully filmed and well acted soap opera. If you would rather see a movie about true romantic love and commitment, check out Big Eden."
3,Good Acting BUT,"This movie deserves the 3 academy awards for its excellent acting ... but because I knew in advance that both main actors where hetero I was not drawn into the plot. I even good bore.Sure, it's a good thing that this movie was made, if only to bring forth the fact, that gay people are not ""freaks of nature"" or ""abomination from hell"" as repeatedly told to us by the conservative righteous holier-than-thou evangelists.I much preferred ""SOLDIER'S GIRL"" which is an extremely moving ""true"" story that shows the drastic impact and consequences, when we are dealing with hatred, bigotry, ignorance, homo-odium and intolerance."
2,What a let down!,"If Universal is smart, they will delay the release of the ""SPECIAL COLLECTORS' EDITION"" until they can add something with more ""meat"" to it. Brokeback Mountain fans are very disappointed. This is evidenced by the lousy reviews given this edition here at Amazon. Many of us were hoping for the inclusion of the legendary ""hippie"" scene that was deleted from the original release, as well as a director's commentary, and possibly a commentary with Jake and Heath. Maybe when this ""special"" edition doesn't sell, Universal will sit up and take notice."
5,BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN IS GREAT!,I`m live in Perù. I loved BBM. It`s a heartbreaking movie. I think the actors did an amazing job besides Jake and Heath are so hot. I can`t wait to get my dvd.
4,Worth watching even if it makes you uncomfortable.,"I felt ""Brokeback Mountain's"" overall message was one of self-realization and the harmfulness of fear, denial, secrets, and dishonesty. I think theme of the film showed the wastefulness of life when one doesn't follow his or her own heart but let's others dictate the terms of one's own life."
5,Beautiful and Heartbreaking,"I just finished watching Brokeback Mountain about 5 minutes ago. I defy anyone not to take away with them the beauty, the joy, the longing, and the heartbreak. As I type this I am still crying from watching it. Its a moving testament of the power of love and of the human heart, you dont choose who you love, your heart makes the decision. I thought Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were brilliant. I love that, all they saw was a moving and powerful story of the human heart, and not just some gay movie. It was so much more then that, and if people cant see that then I feel sorry for them."
3,was a alright movie,"I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS GOING TO BE ABOUT COWBOYS, WHEN I FOUND THIS MOVIE AT A PAWN SHOP I GOT IT I LIKE COWBOY MOVIES. LOLWELL, THAT NIGHT I WAS WATCHED IT, THIS MOVIE WAS SAD A LITTLE AND WAS ALRIGHT I THOUGHT.YOU NEVER KNOW WHO A PERSON REALLY IS AND WHAT THEIR FEELING AND INSIDES REALLY ARE."
1,Nothing special about this Collector's Edition,"This ""Collector's Edition"" is a big disappointment. Not only is the transfer exactly the same as on the previous releases, there are not many new extras, anyway. The space of the second disc was probably not at all required. The biggest disappointment is that again the three hour Director's Cut of the movie is not made available."
5,"Prejudice Sexists, Get Off This Review Board","I am writing this review to conteract the reviews of two prjudice sexists on the review board, Ryan Tierney ""Ryan"" and luv_nature. Both of these reviewers know the two men in Brokeback Mountain are in love, and that it is an incredible love story. Yet, they are enforcing the idea that traditional Western thinking of homophobia is the standard of the film. Instead of embracing such though provoking, and wonderful movie, they are what reviewer, Robert Frost, called ""Propaganda Driven Activists.""The comments they left are in no way helpful to the movie, and should not even exist on the review board. This is a incredible movie, and we all know it. If there are any more of you prejudice sexists that judge this film on your personal bias, get off the board immediately so that others may enjoy the film."
5,makes those of us with a lost love burn.....,"I think the thing that most strikes me about this movie is how much it trancends sex and gender. I am a hetero female, and this movie literally makes me burn for past lost loves. Bravo...."
4,"No expectations, I gave it a try => a great movie","I heard so much about this movie from its original release in theaters to the Oscars, and now the DVD version.I rent the DVD with no expectations. I was really impressed with both the actors and the story setting. It is such a different vision of homosexuality. This movie shows the power of passion like anyone did before.Touching, great actors, beautiful landscapes part of the poetic dialogues, a must see ! It may change your opinion on a couple of things..."
1,"Nice scenery, little else","I couldn't agree more with Mary Wells' review. How are you supposed to get anything out of this movie if you can barely understand what the lead characters are saying? I guess I'll have to wait for the special ""non-mumbling"" DVD version to come out!"
1,Terrible Movie.,This was a terrible movie! It's so very sexist. This movie condones men treating women like dirt so that the men can get off on whatever desires they may have. The fact that you're gay doesn't mean you have the right to treat women like that.
1,yawn....zzzz,"This movie was so boring that I was falling asleep in the theater and my boyfriend had to pinch me to keep my head up. I can't believe this movie is being called Oscar worthy?!?!?! I've seen better [...] movies than this. This movie was nothing new, just basically the same sad plot about two men falling in love ending in tragedy and sadness. YAWN. Boring. Whatever. Michelle Williams was the only interesting character to me, but beyond that, I am pretty sure I won't be buying this on DVD or bother watching it again."
2,Brokeback Mountain,"Anthor one of those highly overrated movies.There is not much to say that already hasn't been covered.Heath Ledger's mumblings are annyoing and the story was boring.There was no chemistry between these two.I didn't feel any love between them just 2 horny guys going at it.I didn't like the fact that Michelle Williams character stayed with Heath Ledger when it was obvious he was into men.She couldn't have a normal realationship with him.If this movie wasn't about 2 gay cowboys it would have never received so much hype.Just because it was something that has never been done before does not make it good!I wish people were more honest when it comes to this movie.I guess if people gave it negative reviews they would be afraid that more movies like this won't be made.There is a right way a nd a wrong way to do it,and this isn't the way.I will give one extra star for the scenery though."
1,digusting,This movie is not fit for family viewing or for single viewing. I was very digusted with sexual contations and burned the item.
1,Not even good,this is just gay porn that hit the big screen. It is highly overrated and how can you feel sorry for people who are cheating on their wives.
1,What a horrible movie,This movie has the worst story and character development. I hated this movie. It shouldn't have won any awards if you judge it on the basis of quality. It was boring and silly. What a waste of time. This is the movie everyone was going crazy about? It's a Lifetime movie at best.
2,So-So,"As a movie and measuring the entertainment value, this movie really has none. Just because it is different does not make it good. The characters are not very believable and the story lacks substance. A man who is straight all of his life and then one day wakes up in a tent with another man. Choosing to cheat on his wife just because of an urge. Fine if that is the story, but how can you feel for a character that does not feel he should be responsible to his own family? The movie should have been stronger is its portrayal of the consequences one must endure when you do something so vile as cheating. Basic Instinct the movie comes to mind. He cheated and had to go throw some serious hell because of it which he justly deserved.I still give it 2 stars. Though the acting was bad, still has some minor entertainment value but best served to wait until it comes out on a premium cable channel. Not worth spending extra $$."
1,Wasted opportunity,Universal should be ashamed of themselves.It's a pure money-grubbing release.This set is neither special nor collectible.
5,Monumental,First film of its kind. Both beautiful and devastating. A true heartbreaking story about love and it's denial. Ang Lee is a genius of cinema and human emotion on many levels. This film was denied best picture because of it's subject matter by a community in which many of the same people helped build and made it America's royalty. This film in time will be regarded an American classic! A must see for all.
5,Brokeback Mountain - DVD,"A heartbreaking story of two young gay cowboys, who meet each other herding sheep on Brokeback mountain. Down through the years, they get together twice a year, for some rest and relaxation. Jack would love to get together and live together, but Ennis resists because of the social ramifications and an incident that happened when he was a young boy of barely nine years old. I initially watched this movie because of the titillating nature of the subject matter, but halfway through, I started to understand this is much, much more than just a gay cowboy movie. I bought it off amazon.com because I'd loved to be able to watch it whenever I wanted to."
5,A film to challenge the concept of love,"This lovingly presented story of two angst ridden cowboys riding the rail of societal taboos is a metaphor for the long lonely beautiful expanse, the love affair exists inside of.The actors never get to give their all and that sometimes reminds us of the issues gay people deal with in general,(hiding)in our current world of anonymous identity.Yes,even with this movie the civil rights of gay/lesbian people are not protected by federal law.The ensemble is perfect showing the ability for each person to flesh out their responses to relationships straight or gay that are mired by limitation. Ang Lee's work will be a landmark movie for eons to come.I feel ""Crash"" will be considered a lesser movie,and people will be questioning why this epic earned best director,and why it didn't get recognition for the most engaging film of the year. I believe this movie will have social consequences,when homophobic people view it on video in their own living rooms..."
5,possitive input,"to all , this movie is a must see for anyone who has had a family member or a friend that is gay.i have several friends that are gay and i would not trade them for the world. i consider them very special people.after all god created all and the gay are in that catagory!!"
4,Essentially good,"I was truly touched by this movie, even though at some parts I wanted to fast forward because the plot slowed down. The cinematography was superb, Ang Lee did us Wyomingites proud (even though this is filmed in Canada). In Wyoming, this is a real issue that no one wishes to consider. Gay beatings do happen here (Matthew Shepard)and there are many homophobes here. Homosexuality is a taboo and Ennis had realistic thoughts about Jack and himself living together. You must be open minded while watching the film because it does get intense in some areas, but definately a film that needs to be watched at least once."
3,Pretty Good...,"There isn't really much to criticize in this movie. The acting is superb, the scenery is stunning, and the emotion is so raw, it really tugs the heart strings. But I have to admit that there was too much hype and pretentious praise to Brokeback Mountain. I wasn't blown away by it. I didn't necessarily think that it was ""the greatest love story of all time,"" or that the movie was ""the best film ever made,"" but for what it is, it's definitely a triumph that breaks boundaries, hopefully allowing the film industry to broaden their horizons and touch upon deeper and untouched territory that we shouldn't necessarily hide or be afraid of. Even though at times this movie felt a bit too long and was kind of boring at some parts, it's something to check out at least once."
2,Did not live up to the hype,This was my first time seeing the movie and I found that it did not live up to the hype.
2,What the hell?,"[...] I like the movie, but this is a dvd that is utterly LACKING in extra / bonus / supplementary material. The cover art has it listed as a ""Four Star Collection"". Well it's only getting 2 stars from me for NO commentaries, NO deleted scenes, NO isolated score, NO trailers. Maybe Universal is readying a ""Randy Quaid Gets Paid Special Edition"" for later. Any way you look at it, this edition is anorexic. There isn't even a booklet or anything when you open the case. Is this any way to issue this film? I think not. If you have to have it, you have to have it. You should wait for a deluxe edition if you can rather than get taken / swindled by Universal and Focus Features."
1,Smells LIke a Rip Off,"In this day of releasing extra's AFTER the first release, there best be some GOOD extra's to make the public buy the same thing YET again. Sounds like you got some ""postcards"" from Brokeback mountain here....YAWNNNNNNNNNNN Only Ennis would want postcards......."
5,LOVE IT!,"I just wanted to say, EXCELLENT SHIPPING! I got it 2 days later than an actual date showed there. I totally love the movie, and everything is perfect when I received it. The movie, gave me tears! I totally fall in love with this movie and it has excellent price too! THANK YOU!!!"
4,Una xran película con un tema poco atrayente,Fotoxrafia extraordinari muchas veces en paisajes espectacularesEn casa se puede pasar a xran velocidad las escenas escabrosas lo que sin duda alxuna mejora la película.Buena músicaEstupenda actuación de H LedxerQuaid borda su corto papel
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A movie that was embraced as a homosexual anthem (despite being about bisexuals), Brokeback Mountain has beautiful cinematography and a compelling first hour, but is much less successful when attempting to show the characters being consumed with longing."
4,Controversial Melodrama!,"After much debate, I decided to view this film with an open mind. The performances are outstanding. I really liked the music composition, as it flowed gently with the story. In a way, I'm glad this film didnt't win ""Best Picture"". For one reason. The on-location scenery is absolutely breathtaking to watch. Maybe its too perfect. Later on, We find out it's not Wyoming, but it Alberta, Canada. Take a star away! Overall, this is a movie that will advance gay right in the United States. For those who don't like it, ""the train has left the station!"""
5,Love this Movie Like No Other,"I actually first heard of this film last November after seeing a trailer online. Well, I felt emotions and a connection with what I saw like no other time I can think of. I read the book and fell in love with these characters and like so many others, related to the experience. It became life altering for me as well. After seeing the film I was devastated. I cried during and after the movie. recalls many of my relationships from the past and renews me with feelings of love. And I thought I would remain jaded. It is so true that Heath Ledger is truly incredible here as Ennis, and Jake Gyllenhaal will break your heart as Jack. They give wonderful performances. Just recieved my copy of the DVD and watched it again. It seems to flow easier with each viewing, and you catch a little more of what you missed each time. Thanks, Annie, for a little story, and Ang Lee for making it happen. This has finally replaced Parting Glances(from 1986!) as my favorite film."
5,Exceeding Expectations,"In this movie, both main actors portray characters which come across as completely believable. Willingly or not, you are drawn to the difficulties they encounter and find yourself immerse and fully identified with both characters and the dilema that rules their entire lives.A must see movie this year!!! Definitely an all-time classic. Buy this film now! You will be happy that you did."
5,BBM,"This is the best movie ever made, and this collector's edition is wonderful. However, I'd still like to see another disc with outtakes, deleted scenes, etc., as I for one can not get enough of the BBM experience."
5,BM was beautiful,"I bought a new compaq 2630 for viewing movies...BM was perfect for this project. Wide screen worked very well. No drop outs, full sound and excellent color..Great!!JS in Dallas"
2,Not So Good,"All the reviews are sort of funny. I rate movies on their entertainment value. Just because it was the first of its kind or different does not automatically make it any good. Another year of the awards season and another year of great disappointment. Million Dollar Baby last year started the downward slide for me. Everyone talked about it but it really wasn't that good. Same with this movie BB. For purely entertainment value it has no substance. My wife personally hates any movie that advocates cheating on your spouse behind their back so that does make her a little biased.So from an entertainment value perspective, this movie just doesn't perform. It is a good one to maybe rent for a few dollars, but if you buy it (and you actually have a taste for entertainment), then you will be greatly dissapointed."
1,Boring movie,"...with beautiful scenery, which tells you how bad the movie was... you passed the time watching the scenery"
1,U.S. rejected this film. Proof: Not even in top 20 in 2005-6 boxoffice,"Rejected by most moviegoers but not for the reasons the left wants you to believe. It is a boring movie and the characters were too wooden and not believable. There were no real 'good people', just victims of numerous bad decisions. The two cowboys were victims and later they turned their families into victims of adultery, pain, and betrayal.Many couples got up and left the theatre and it was only a quarter full at best even after the Academy Awards. An American tragedy with one redeeming quality ... the nature scenes were very well filmed. Save your money and buy The Chronicles of Narnia."
1,Don't believe everything you read on the 5 star reviews,Not suitable for someone who doesn't watch R-rated movies to begin with but trusted too much the reviews. Duh! Dumb me!
2,More about sex than love,"I went to the theatres, naively believing the trailers' claims of a love movie, and left disappointed. It is more about sex than love: Ennis enjoys the gratification, but doesn't take it further; Jack continues to seek other homosexual partners throughout his life. The film is very weak until redeemed by the last 20 minutes, which are powerful.As for the acting, the male leads are alright... I was blown away by Michelle Williams, and never again will Ann Hathaway simply be known as ""that girl in the Princess Diaries.""The cinematography is beautiful, but one can find equally stunning visuals in better movies."
2,a disappointment,lots of expectations. i did not see the movie at the time when it was released and decided to follow advice from friens. everybody said it was a must. rather boring!
1,Crap,Pure crap. I could say more but crap sums it up. Nothing more needs to be said to review this want to be entertainment.
1,Brokeback Mountain,"Didn't care much for the movie. I think that the only thing that I enjoyed watching was the backgound settings. There was no ""chemistry"" as they say where Heath Ledger was concern. At times he looked like he was really uncomfortable with the role. Like you could tell that he wasn't really gay. Jake on the other hand, was really into the character role. Overall, I didn't like the entire movie. I was expecting more."
1,Brokeback boredom,"Mumbled dialogue, abject sqalour and dysfuctional relationships. And oh so boring. I enjoyed the mountain scenes with the sheep, but they only occupied about 1% of the movie. Interesting that so many people rate it highly on Amazon, everone I have actually met thought the same as I did. Must be a sampling artefact."
1,Did NOT like the movie,These 2 guys ruined the lives of 5 other people----I totally hated the movie and do not know what all the fuss was about.
1,dissatisfaction,"I HAVE BOUGHT SEVEN DVD'S FROM AMAZON.COM WITHIN THE LAST FEW WEEKS (AND I REALLY WANT ALL OF THEM !) AND SIX OF THE SEVEN DO NOT WORK IN MY DVD PLAYER. MY DVD PLAYER IS A MODERN ONE, I HAVE HAD NO TROUBLE WITH IT , AND IT PLAYS OTHER DVD'S THAT I HAVE . WHEN I TRY TO PLAY A DVD THAT I HAVE BOUGHT FROM YOU, THE RESPONSE IS""THIS DISC DOES NOT WORK. CHECK YOUR DISC"".BOTH MY TV AND MY DVD PLAYER IS ""SAMSUNG"".......AND THERE IS REALLY NO REASON WHY THE DVD'S DO NOT WORK. PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS .......BECAUSE I REALLY WANT THESE DVD'S.......AND THERE IS NO REASON WHY THEY SHOULD NOT WORK.I WILL BE GLAD TO GIVE YOU ALL THE NAMES OF THE DVD' S THAT I HAVE RECENTLY BOUGHT. (AND THEY ARE ALL NEW DVD'S). AND PERHAPS WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, BECAUSE I REALLY WAN TO KEEP THESE DVD'S. THEY ARE ALL CLASSIS MOVIES, THAT I REALLY WANT. THANK YOU. ROBERTA BABCOCK"
3,Not for Everyone,"More haunting than entertaining. I did watch it twice. Is THIS what MEN do who want to get together without their wives, or is this simply what the movie is leading us to believe is a possible reason? First off, this is no documentary. Secondly, it's fiction. Third, is an explosive mix of taboo and today's political correctness. I am left with the feeling that Broke Back Mountain is more of a fantacy. A fantacy about a lifestyle with a never the less realistic pattern of self destruction."
5,Excellent Moving and Unforgetable Movie,You will never forget this movie once you see it. It is haunting. A real culutral breakthrough topic. It won't dissappoint those looking for a real tear jerker of a movie.
5,A True Classic and Touching Story,"I've been meaning to get this dvd for some time and glad I finally had the chance and watched it as soon as it arrived at my home. This is a classic, bittersweet story about two men finding a special kind of love together in spite of their every day lives. It shed knew light and understanding on some of the relationships I've been blessed by in my past and ones I will cherish my whole life. I'm sure I'll watch this story again and again."
4,"Beautiful, yet sad","Brokeback MountainMain Cast: Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, and Anne HathawayA raw, powerful story of two young men, Ennis a ranch hand and Jack an aspiring rodeo bull rider, are sent to work together herding sheep on Brokeback Mountain, and what had otherwise been anticipated to be a rather uneventful venture, will soon turn into an affair of love, of lust, and complications that will spand through 19 years of their lives. Through marriage, through children, and through the mighty grip of societal confines and the expectations of what it is to be a man.First, this movie begins in 1963 and during that time, to be gay was absolutely against society rules. Also, if you're hoping that this movie will change your beliefs against people being gay. The movie can't, you must keep an open mind, you have to decide for yourself if you enjoy this or not."
5,Beautiful film,"Between the writing, the acting, the emotion of the story and the breathtaking scenery ""beautiful"" is the best description of this film. The emotional range of the film goes from sweet to sad to frustrating to heartbreaking but in the end, even if you are bawling like a baby after the credits roll you'll still be glad you watched it."
2,Boring,I caught this on TV and found it kind of a boring cycle of hurt and comfort with a predictable ending. It just can't do justice to the Annie Proulx story. I actually didn't finish watching it. You could probably read the story in the same amount of time.
3,interesting subject but I thought it dragged,"The main thing I didn't understand was if these two guys really wanted to be together, why didn't they move someplace where they could be accepted? There have been many cities that accepted gays. NY, SF, New O., Chicago, and most major cites in the north. Why not go there? If they they were gay why did they marry women? None of this made sense to me. I remember the 60's and there were gay people who were out, and nobody cared. I don't think the movie was a true perspective of gay life when these 2 guys got together. It wasn't until the 80's and HIV came along that homosexuality became a big scare, and with good reason. But back in the 60s and 70's gays were accepted in many cities.If they wanted to ride around in the mountains, and get married, then they made their choices. Nobody can have it all."
3,Winners by Themselves,"Natural beauty of America varies between states, and Wyoming is really scenic for its mountains covered with forests, pristine grass and rivers originating at.Although male cowboy relations disclosed with a movie expertly sustained a definite attraction of viewers, both plot and performance have not been exceptionally innovative in world cinematography.Broad willingness to watch this film and public preparedness to assume and freely discuss an issue in the most parts of a world are the best winners by themselves."
3,IF ONLY PEOPLE WOULD READ THE SHORT STORY . . .,"Brokeback Mountain is a short story included in CLOSE RANGE: WYOMING STORIES by Annie Proulx. EVERY story in this collection is brilliant. The movie's only a faint echo of Proulx's wonderful observations and characterizations. Read the book, you'll see the movie is okay; but comparatively slow and flat. (ALL Proulx's work is great; no surprise she nabbed a Pulitzer, National Book Award. BBMT is only 30-pages long, dip in!)"
3,SOMEWHAT GOOD,"A tale of love that happens to be about two men who battle with their guilt in being gay and facing the repercussions of an intolerant society. Set from the 60s to 70s in the middle regions of the USA.Based on a short story. Script adaption was very popular and floated around Hollywood for several years until someone was brave enough to touch it and turn it into a film.Worth a look but I feel CAPOTE and CRASH were better.I'm sure bitter people will click NOT HELPFUL just out of spite, so, go for it, people. Show me your rage and lack of an open mind. Come on, do it. :D"
1,Handsome Actors Does Not Create History,"I WONDER IF ENNIS & JACK WERE PLAYED BY GENE WILDER & WOODY ALLEN WOULD THESE REVIEWERS OPINIONS ABOUT HOW HISTORICALLY RELEVENT BROKEBACK MOUNTIAN REALLY IS STILL BE IMPORTANT TO THEM?ARE THEY DEFENDING BBM SO WE CAN GET SOME MORE HANDSOME CRUMBS FROM THE HOLLYWOOD TABLE?SICK AS THAT MAY SOUND, ISN'T THAT WHAT HOLLYWOOD HAS ALWAYS DONE?LET'S FACE IT, DEATH SELLS, AND GAY DEATH SELLS EVEN MORE.BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN IS A FORMULA FILM. TAKE 2 GORGEOUS ACTORS, PUT THEM BACK IN TIME FOR JUSTIFICATION, ADD TERRIFIC SCENERY, STIR IN SOME WILD GAY LOVEMAKING, KILL ONE OFF FOR THE GAY GUILT SYNDROME AND WHAT DO YOU HAVE? ANOTHER DESCRIPTIVE HORRIFIC MOVIE OF THE MURDER OF A GAY MAN.SALES WERE GREAT!THOSE OF US WHO SAW THROUGH THE CELULOID PACKAGING OF BBM WERE JUST CRUSHED TO SEE ANOTHER GENERATION FALLING FOR THE SAME OLD GUILT GAME."
1,Another waste of movie money,"I just can't believe there is a movie studio who would actually pay to have garbage like this produced. If I had three thumbs, I would give it three thumbs down."
1,The worst flick of 2005,"I am amazed with the amount of five star reviews that this awful movie has recieved.This is not a true western movie as a real western movie features gun fights,action sequences pillaging and tough masculine actors like JOHN WAYNE,BURT LANCASTER,STEVE MCQUEEN and CLINT EASTWOOD.Dont waste your time and money on this weepy boring gay cowboy movie which features an insipid and weepy love story.AVOID."
1,typical,"well what do you expect when hollywood tries to shove a social issue down our throats with a large, three pronged stick? gillenhall and eckhart, or ledger or whoever this fool is star in a show that is politically motivated to show two cowboys posing as sheepherders posing as lovers.i dont know what was more ridiculous, the fact it is not true or the fact gillen halls cast person in the movie dodges the draft to roll in the hay with his pal a few more times.the mountains are very pretty. the woman are as well. anne hathaway does a great job in the back seat of a car. the director did a good spin job here! finally everyone has moved on to doing something better, because with all the zombies running around you never know what might happen on the mountain."
3,about the movie brokeback Mountain......,"This is basically a gay sexual content movie that talks about the two gays that always together but in the end, one of the gay cowmen is having trouble with his marriage and so......let you'll find out the rest of the story yourself. This movie is considered soft tone in nature meaning that not like last time where the cowmen open fires while riding the horse, pull the man on the floor with a rope on one of the leg. (swinging the rope and the rope grab hold of one of the leg of the man and he rode fast causing the cowmen to fall on the flloe and being dragged. I have an idea of a story that is of this nature but it talks about men showing their mighty power to control a place etc...."
2,"Moral issues aside, hasn't anyone noticed that this film just wasn't that good??","I don't care what you think about the moral issues portrayed, this was just not a very entertaining film. It did not deserve such hype. It was extremely slow, and I'm sorry, but Heath Ledger's character was just not likeable. He was a drunk and a terrible father and refused to make a commitment one way or another. How can the struggle about his sexual orientation be compelling when he wasn't even a decent guy on so many other levels. I applaud the director's concept of show-casing bigotry, etc, but at least give us a character who's worthy of rooting for."
5,A movie that will stay with me for the rest of my life,"I know the title sounds very drastic or dramatic, but thats just how i feel. This movie simply puts the energy of love, in all her glory on display,for the world to witness,and lessons are taught as she is betrayed.I think one of the reasons why this movie is so profound to millions of people, is because straights can witness that gay love is just like theirs. Love is the common bond between all of us here on this green earth, and Brokeback Mountain illustrates that beautifully."
5,"A tragic love story, nothing more","Forget that they are gay, it doesn't matter. It's a love story. The movie is very moving. It could be about any two people in love who fight it for any reason and marry other people for financial or other reasons of convenience, only to realize later their love for each other is strong, passionate & real - a love for a lifetime. I liked it."
5,Why do we even bother...,"Seeing talk about how men should behave, and how women should behave, and how men shouldn't be brought up by women really disturbs me. Even after countless hours of schooling where children are taught that it is healthy to express their emotion. Even after countless marriage experts who have shared their expertise on TV. Even when the film industry is brave enough to make a masterpiece as moving as Brokeback Mountain, showing that men can express truly love to each other, there are still people backwards enough to reject that.Seriously, why do we even bother trying to create an intelligent society when brainless people still walk on our streets?"
5,Almost love ... but reality strikes!,"I waited till 10/2006 to watch this movie for the first time, allowing time to pass between the hype and the actual film. The viewing was well worth the wait.The cinematography is beautiful. I found the characters engaging and believable to a fault. How many of us have wrestled with wanting only to give in to needing? I can see that there would be a narrow interest in this film but that should not detract from its true-to-life story line. Those of you who have not lived the wanting vs. needing scenario may not appreciate the beauty of this film quite as much as those of us who have.Watch it ... enjoy it ... consider its beauty. Then let it be."
2,Gay Love Minus the Eroticism,"Many beautiful nature shots can't redeem this dull and overly long flick. There is no real chemistry between the two main characters. The one sex scene is dark, frantic, and anti-erotic. Other than for some rough housing, there is little to make one think these guys are attracted to one another. Too much time is spent on their separate lives. It would have been interesting to get a glimpse of their inner lives, perhaps their fantasies, given they were so adamant about getting together at Brokeback Mountain every year while they were married to women. This director clearly knows nothing about what attracts one person to another."
1,I'll call it what it is: boring,"If it wasn't about a Gay couple, no one would have seen it. Let this be a lesson to any would be writer or director, it'll be your cash cow, if you are sitting on a bad to mediocre romance story, if you write the couple as gay, no one will have the courage to give it a bad review or even call it what it is; boring. Seriously, rent ""The English Patient,"" & be slightly more entertained."
5,Why?,This is my question to this movie. Why two people in love need to live like that. This is a fantastic movie but very sad. I just loved!! A love story..
2,Sad Story . . .,"The acting was good, but the story was such a downer--very depressing. I don't need to watch it again. It is the type of movie that seeing it once is enough."
5,excellent,I watched this movie several times and enjoyed it every time. It's sad that society can't allow people to be themselves and are so judgemental about other's choices in life styles. Being beaten to death because of a different life style is unacceptable.
4,AWESOME MOVIE,"I am in the military and i liked this movie, i thought this movie was great and had a great plot, the only reason i gave it a four not a five was it was drawn out a litle too far, and i didn't care for the ending but something had to happen, but i hated it and in a wierd way liked the ending, but i would highly advise others to watch it and the scenes are not as explicit as everyone speaks ok, they had some good kissing scenes but other than that you see some butt shots and one sex scene in shich you do no see anything but know whas going on, thats it, well like i said before great movie."
5,Great speaker mounts!,These mounts are easy to install and allow you to mount speakers from the bottom or the back which is extremely helpful when using small speakers.
3,Excellent smaller guide,This is a decent little book that's easy to tote around. Sometimes I think that pictures help more than drawings for tree identification but this book makes up for it with good written details for each entry. Can't be beat for something to throw in the backpack.
2,Poor Choice for Tree Identification,"Despite the excellent illustrations and detailed information, this is a POOR book for actually identifying an unknown tree from its foliage, bark, or other characteristics.The book divides trees into their families. Unfortunately, this requires that you have some idea of what you are looking for before you start. There is no cross-reference to bark to reinforce a choice. Also, since it includes both Eastern and Western North American trees, one can easily make a false choice.However, its handbook size is convenient for a carry along."
2,i wish it had actual pictures instead of drawings....,"i wish this actually had pictures of the actual leaves and trees instead of hand drawn renderings. so i was a bit disappointed with this book. i am definitely going to get one with actual photographs next time,"
4,learn& live,"An in-depth easy to understand , comprehensive read for those who appreciate naturea and would like to say more then: ""hey, that's a pretty tree""."
4,Nice Little pocket book,"This is a nice little pocket book that can be taken just about anywhere. Though not as complete as some of the larger books, it really does help to identify most trees. The color photos help with the identification and it is well worth the price to throw in your backpack or on your bike when in the woods."
2,Tress of North America,"What I don't like abou this book is that it doesn't really show the shape of the foilage of various trees not does it give adequate descriptions of flowers, bark and identifying marks. Consequently, it does not give me the help I wante in identifying trees. I would not reccommend this book to others. JMM"
2,NO Good.,"I was disappointed in this book. I'll start with the good, though. It had a nice explanation of the tree traits and what to look for when you are identifying trees. It's also small and easy to carry. There's the good. The bad is that all the pictures were drawn. Now, before you buy the book, it does state that the book does not have a complete list of all the trees found in the USA. That said, the three trees in my hood that I wanted to identify, were not in there. I'm going to buy a more complete guide to find these trees."
2,Probably OK for a high school class,"This book really boils down the subject of astronomy into a few rules of thumb. It is good to have some rules of thumb nearby to aid your memory, but historically a Schaum's outline has been a challenging yet cheap little tome to get you through the rough spots. This book won't do that unless you are in a high school class. It won't cut it for a college level astronomy class.I suggestTextbook on Spherical Astronomyas a good aid. Used copies generally come pretty cheap and it is very useful with good solved examples and problems. Once you finish that try outAstronomical Algorithms. The author shows a real love for his subject with some interesting problems in algorithmic form, but he lacks a great deal in explanation.Used copies of this outline usually cost under one dollar. Thus if you just need rules of thumb in a handy form, this might be worth that much. Just don't pay list price for what amounts to a ""Pocket Guide to Astronomy""."
5,"""40 Acres"" Is Superb!","Since discovering Caedmon's Call last year, I have purchased every album available, even having gone so far as to special order the 1996 independently- produced ""My Calm//Your Storm"" from Houston. Each CD holds a special place in my heart, from the 1996 recording to ""Intimate Portrait"" (the E-CD is a powerful legacy of the band's recording sessions with Rich Mullins) and the 1997 self-titled album. However, I find ""40 Acres"" to be the tightest, most winningsome release yet. Every song, as other reviews here attest to, is a hit. Cliff Young's vocals, on ""My Calm//Your Storm,"" first attracted my attention, but with time, and especially thanks to ""40 Acres,"" Derek Webb has shown me his amazing talent and potential (with ""Thankful,"" and ""Faith My Eyes,"" for example).Caedmon's Call remains at the top of my list of contemporary alternative Christian groups. Now if I could just find them in concert near me!"
4,Another great Caedmon's Call CD,"One of those rare albums that I purchased based on the quality of the previous album, 40 Acres didn't disappoint. In general, not as deep as their first record, but incorporating more straight praise of God. Highlights include the laid-back-yet-upbeat first single, ""There You Go"", the calm and hopeful ""Faith My Eyes"", and the wonderfully encouraging title track. The music doesn't shift much from the acoustic pop of the first album. This time around, the songwriting duties were shared equally between Derek Webb and Aaron Tate, with one song written by Shawn Colvin, (the superb ""Climb On""). Overall, very few surprises, but a very good follow-up to their previous record."
4,Great! but needs more Cliff!,"This is an excellent effort by CC. the only thing needed to complete it is more Cliff Young vocals. Derek Webb is great but Cliff's voice is just incredible. ""My Calm//Your Storm"" is still a superior cd in my opinion, but i can listen to this one over and over, especially ""40 Acres"" and ""Climb On."" i highly recommend the cd; it will be among the best you own."
5,"Refreshing, Exhilarating, and Theologically Sound","This is a scripturally sound cd. The lyrics are deep, but easy to understand. The music is incredible and has everything from upright basses to electric guitars to harmonicas. A light alternative style that is fun to listen to, sing with, and is amazingly Biblical."
5,~my favorite album~,"This is still one of my favorite albums of all time. Caedmon's Call is such an awesome group, and this CD is absolutely amazing from start to finish! Some of the highlights are the title track -- ""40 Acres"" -- along with ""Shifting Sand"", and ""Where I Began"". Derek Webb's ""Somewhere North"" is incredible, and one of the most underrated songs on the album...""Faith My Eyes"" is also such a powerful song. The biggest radio hits have probably been ""There You Go"" and ""Thankful"".I think one of the most amazing things about Caedmon's Call is that they can sing so many different styles of music -- from 3 different lead singers. Cliff Young and Derek Webb both have awesome songs on here, and Danielle Young simply has the voice of an angel!Bottom line: there is something for everyone on this amazing album. Such talented and deep songwriting from Aaron Tate and Derek Webb shines throughout every song on the album. Take a listen to the CD - it's well worth it!!!!! Overall ~10/10~"
5,Not their sophomore release,"Actually, Caedmon's had previously released a few albums, including My Calm//Your Storm, Caedmon's Call, and an EP called Just Don't Want Coffee. This album shines with songwriting brilliance, but in my opinion is not as wonderful as My Calm//Your Storm. It is however, a must-have for anyone who calls himself a Christian music fan."
5,A musical masterpiece,"I bought this CD after having heard 'Back Home' and 'In the Company of Angels' and am pleased to say that this has been my favorite CD by CC. It maybe the best display of Derek Webb's talent. His warm and passionate voice and guitar work is ever-present. The blend of different musical styles is so flowing that they do not clash, but rather harmonize very well. Their style is that of a folk/rock and is very enjoyable. Buy this CD, you won't be dissapointed."
3,Abes Thoughts....,"I don't know about you, but I took a quick glance at this cd. It was good, but not great. Then again, I'm a harder rock/pop fan. I like this cd, though it won't make my birthday wish list."
1,Sorry,"Once again I think that they have gotten away from melodies and other elements that would make this a good album. The lyrics are strong and they follow Jesus, but the music is lacking. I personally wouldn't purchase this album."
5,Devoted Christian? you will be...,A fantastic album that all Christians can relate to and enjoy. All songs are thoughtful and wonderfully written. If you like the self titled Jars of Clay album then you'll love this. You really must buy it. Mae record yn bendigedig iawn. Rhaid i chi prynu hon. Diolch yn fawr iawn.
4,Good...but could have done better,"This was a good album. But they could have done better on this one. Not as good as the first album and few songs I didn't like. My favorite song was ""Forty Acres"". If you like slow songs buy this album, but if you like fast songs then don't. I called this album more like a country album than rock."
3,Best Christian release of 99 so far. :-),"I love Aaron Tate's songs. Shifting Sand is gorgeous, There you go, and 40 Acres are both good, Petrified Heart...well, any song making reference to the Levite Priest in Judges, RULES! I had some problems with Derek Webb's songs, Table for Two is annoying... the others are mediocre... Daring Daylight Escape is Awesome though."
2,"It's 50-50. I like some, not the rest.","Caedmon's Call is very interesting. Half of their songs are written by a non-performing friend of theirs, and the rest by one of the musicians. The problem is, their writing styles are completely different. I really like the Derek Webb-penned stuff (especially Somewhere North - it is by far the best Caedmon's song yet). But the Aaron Tate stuff is just mainstream pop that not only sounds very undistinctive (ie. like many other comtemporary Christian bands), but sounds exactly like the Aaron Tate songs on the last albums. My verdict: The Derek songs are keepers, the others are throwaways. Nothing against the performers, it's the writing."
2,"""Thankful"" I'm not Hyper Calvinist","Yes, words do have meaning.....whether you like Caedmon's style of music or not, biblical evangelicals should find ""Thankful"" very disturbing. Caedmon's Call's Calvinistic roots and their veneration of Reformed traditions really come to the forefront in this tune and a closer look at the lyrics reveals the hyper-Calvinistic doctrine of deterministic predestination and reprobation: ""I can't refuse,....Because I have no choice....Through faith that's not my own"". I love CCM, but please go beyond the surface of the music and look at the substance of everything out there!"
5,Awesome songs!,"This album is wonderful! At first, I wasn't really crazy about Caedmon's Call, but now, after listening to this cd, I luv them! My favorite songs are There You Go and Shifting Sands! They are so inspirational!"
5,Caedmon's Best Album!,"From start to finish, in my opinion, 40 Acres is their best work song for song. There are really no weaknesses or tracks to skip on this disc. Highly Recommended for all who like intelligent modern rock, folk rock, and accoustic rock."
5,Final DVD... unless you count the stars.,"Alright, to clear this up for the person whoms review i just saw ( i dont feel like looking up the name, sorry ) yes this is the last Sailor Moon Super S DVD, but not the last DVD for the series. Due to the fact that sailor moon is dying a slow death franchise-wise, no one has released the last series, Sailor Moon Stars, and most likely no one will. They don't want to face what happened with ADV and subtitle it, and it's very doubtful that anyone will dub it into the english language because there would be so much to edit out considering that the final episode usagi is nude in the sky with wings. As much as i like sailor moon, right now it seems the impossible dream that we will get any further past this DVD so therefore you might as well call it the final one. If you want to see what happens so badly, read the manga."
5,In a Class By Itself,"I recently purchased the hard cover version of Mat Irvine's Auto Modelling Masterclass from Amazon.com, and was bowled over by the history, and photography I found within it's pages. Old box art from days gone by, the process of creating a model kit from start to finish, and culminating with some helpful how-to tips. It was none other than Terry Jessee of Scale Auto Enthusiast who clued me in on this book, A tip of the hat to another fine writer. Chock full of color photos, and insights from people within the industry, if you have the slightest interest in model cars, this book is for you."
2,Karaoke CD,This is a really good Karaoke CD but there are not enough songs on it. It only has four. So I think the price is a liitle high since you can get some others with 10 or 12 songs for about the same price.
3,Best left out!,"The film, The Sicilian, did not always make sense, but the cinematography of Sicily was fantastic and the film contained little musical nuggets of an Italian orchestra playing great dance band music. Up poped a Cuban Rhumba, Glenn Millers's String of Pearls and In the Mood as well as Count Basie's Jumpin' at the Woodside. Sadly the soundtrack album included none of these jaunty pieces and leaves one with only the pretty but morose classical stuff. Thus, soft music but no excitement. Boo!"
3,It was rather fair product,"It's happened that the radio arrived when it was in our aria snow storm. And receiving quality of the product was very bad. I was close to return it. However, after that, several days later, we found rather fair quality of translation. I would rather rate it as 3+.What certainly is not satisfactorily it is extremely overpriced.Boris"
3,Nice but weird sizing/design,"They are beautiful but there is something wrong with the sizing and design. I have used Nine West for ages but these did not fit me well. Too bad because I like them, but they feel a little bit to tight and I when I wear them it feels like I'm going to fall"
4,Great shoes. Buy 1/2 a size up.,I wear these shoes every Friday casual day at work. I receive a lot of compliments on them. I would recommend buying them a 1/2 size larger than your normal size though. They are a little tight.
4,Oh sure,"Like an idiot, I got this for rats. Too small for rats! They still flip it like it's nobody's business. However, considering the size, it's a hefty and easy to clean cup. Once I determined the rats weren't going to put up with it, I replaced it with something bigger.Dropped it twice because I'm a klutz, you can't tell."
4,Good Lunchbox just don't drop it!!,"This lunchbox was purchased for my 3 yr old starting pre-school, he loved it, I loved it, has alot of room for plenty of snacks and lunch, but one morning running late rushing out, it dropped on the garage floor and broke, that was that."
4,so much fun,"I have no idea if this is a good lunch box. We owned ours for 6 years and never once packed a lunch in it. But it has successfully carried the following: matchbox cars, trains, videos, stuffed animals, bugs (live and dead), legos, building blocks, raisins, underwear, binoculars, expired credit cards, pokemon cards, plastic animals and, of course, more trains.3 year olds will love this because it comes with different pieces and has different compartments and so it's fun to take apart and put together.The only flaw is that the outer compartment can be hard for little kids to open and close. And the straw bottle cleaning problem others have mentioned.But still, if you have a Thomas fanatic, get this for him or her even if there will never be a lunch in it."
4,Great lunchbox overall,"Great lunchbox, as opposed to the myriad number of lunchbags available. Fun, good storage volume and accessories unmatched - separate sandwich box and pop-top Thermos any 3 yr old can operate. Only downfall, not durable to a significant drop onto a hard surface, will crack. Other than that, it's the tops!"
3,Not durable enough,Bought this for my son to use at preschool. He got it for Christmas and he used it the rest of that school year but it cracked on the bottom. We also had trouble with the thermos leaking sometimes. And I agree that it is hard to make everything fit for a full lunch which is what he requires for kindergarten this year. We'll probably be replacing it soon.
2,Small & Flimsy,Bought this is in January for my son to use for his daily lunch box. It is May and I already have to buy a new lunch box. It was smaller in size than I originally expected. The latch to keep it closed is loose and doesn't stay too secure. My son being 3 dropped it on the floor once and the plastic cracked. Not very good quality for a kids lunchbox. I am buying an soft sided insulated bag this time.
5,"Great overall lunchbox, quite roomy.","Durable plastic, with room enough for the heartiest appetites. The sandwich container has a tray which allows for even more storage. Pecoware made a great product. I'll order their ballerina one for my daughter (it's made exactly like the Thomas one)."
1,Very Quick to Break,This lunch box broke within one week of buying it. The stand on the bottom cracked (can't be fixed) and the thermos broke a week later (totally destroyed). Save your money and buy something else.
2,could be made better,"We like the lunchbox because of the cute designs,but were a little disappointed in it's durability. The first time I dropped it on the ground,it scratched off parts of the design. So,mom did some creative thinking and did some touch up paint and sealed the design with ""self laminating sheets"". That did the trick. We also wished the thermos and lunchbox were insulated. Other than that, it's o.k."
1,High hopes for poor quality,"This appeared to be the perfect lunch box for my little Thomas the Tank engine fan. It has a box for his sandwich with another attachment inside of the box for chips, carrots, etc. It also includes a cute little thermos with a straw attachment inside of it that you push a little button and the straw pops out with the thomas insignia on both. AND THEN, on top of all that wounderfulness is a little door on the outside of the lunch box. First day of school my baby was ""the man"" with his Thomas lunchbox. Second day of school, he dropped it on the way to school and the latch broke AND a hole busted out of the bottom of it. Talk about kill a child's joy... I paid $25 dollars for this lunch box! How is it going to break that hard after the second use. It just shattered like it was glass! It dropped out of his hand, it wasn't thrown. The good thing is if it was not for the sandwich box and thermos he would have had no lunch. You know I want my money back, right?"
3,Cute but not great,"It's a cute lunch box to have if your children are into Thomas. Vibrant colors, easily recognizable. Couple things to keep in mind:If your child doesn't like to eat sandwiches for lunch, consider discarding the sandwich box inside this lunch box. It is not microwaveable and things may explode if you try to put into a microwave. I know, I tried:)After a couple of months, the clips may break or fall off altogether. We had to fix ours.And finally, this box is too heavy for young kids (ages 3-5). I recommend using something lighter or just going the old brown bag route."
5,SON LOVES IT,Very durable. My son loves it. It really takes a beating. I wasn't expecting it to be this well made.
4,Fun Lunchbox,"Very cute and fun lunchbox.My son is three and has just started preschool so this is his first lunchbox and he absolutely loves it. He slept with it the first night he had it... maybe just to ensure that it didn't go anywhere while he was asleep.Durability? I can't say with certainty that it would stand the test of time. It's been in use for just over one month now and already I am seeing a small piece broken off at the bottom. If I can get one year out of it and put a smile on my baby's face at the same time, I would purchase another a year from now. Wish it came in other characters too."
3,Water bottle leaks!,"Like all Thomas products, instant hit with my son. Unfortunately water bottle leaks if not kept upright, which is totally unpractical for a lunch box! Every time it goes on the road open it and water is inside."
5,From redcord to CD,"I had this record many years ago and now, thanks to Amazon, I have it on CD again."
2,Long Time Quicken User,"I want to state that I've been with Quicken since the DOS Version.Quicken Deluxe 2004 does appear to have some problems. After installing it it locked up once while attempting to customize a report. Also after backing up the data it puts a icon ""Q3"" on my desktop?If you currently have Quicken Deluxe 2003 I would suggest that you stay with that version for another year. (...)."
2,"No new features, plenty of new problems","I have used Quicken for over 10 years. This version is probably the worst yet. It reserves huge amounts of screen real estate for Quicken advertisements and messages. Two examples of the steps backwards: (1) you can no longer work while downloading information and (2) you cannot suspend your computer while Quicken is running. It says ""Quicken does not support standby mode."" They've changed to user interface for the worst. For example, reconciled items are now grayed out, with no way to change it back to normal. Also, the investment transaction register now doesn't show the comment lines.I have found no substantial improvement. I think Quicken has decided they're a monopology and don't have to try anymore."
1,Do not convert your 2003 data to 2004,"I have used Quicken for 10 years, and succesfully upgraded every year. I didn't even have a problem switching platforms from Mac to Windows. I just upgraded and converted my data files to Quicken 2004. The program is completley buggy to the point of me not even being able to open it.I bought Money 2004 in an attempt to vote with my dollars, I returned Quicken and bought Money 2004 to no aviail. My automatic backup had copied over my 2003 backup with the 2004 files. Money 2004 cannot import files from Quicen 2004.Intuit can provide me with no further technical assitance, and I am stuck with software that crashes when I open it, at least until they release a patch."
2,Getting worse,"I've been a Quicken user since Managing Your Money evaporated. I've been upgrading to the new annual versions every year in the hope the product defects and in-program advertising were either eliminated or corrected. They get worse every year. If you want to use the simplest portions of the program, it'll probably be okay for you. But if you use it for all your household finances, you'll find frustrating problems that the manufacturer doesn't seem to want to correct and they charge for support. Free support is available online, but after hours of writing back and forth with support personnel, most problems are handled with the description, ""Product Defect"". Good luck, and checkout other programs. Better yet, write Andrew Tobias an email and ask him to bring Managing Your Money back."
1,LOST 4 YEARS OF FINANCIAL DATA,I have been using quicken since 1995. Never had any problems with the 2001 edition. But watchout for the 2004 version. It is by far the worst software I have ever purchased. Do not upgrade if you have older versions of quicken.
4,Its helpful,"This is really a great product. Although many users say that they do not have an Online support, and just charge $1.95 per minute of support, lemme tell you that they also have a Free Live chat support, 7 days a week, where you can chat with a live tech support rep. Also, any bugs, if there are, are being constantly fixed, so I guess you will lose out on a great product if you do not buy this one and upgrade."
2,Not worth the hassle,I've been a quicken user for years and this version has got to be the worst yet. I don't know why I even bother to try and get support since it's virtually non-existent. Though if you want to see all the Intuit Product Ads all over the place you'll really like this program. I just wish that I was able to back-up my files like I used too.
1,Makes a pen and notebook seem like a great idea,"Like others, I was also asked to upgrade (from 2002) and I did. What a mistake. Random bits of my brokerage data was lost and it has taken many months to get it back in order. Reconcilation is a pain with lots of screen delays on my PIII 500. The bugs keep popping up. For example, my security list can not remember the Vanguard S&P500 Index (VFINX). I have to enter it as a new security each time I want to use it. Do I sound frustrated? You bet I am. Watching this once great program turn into what is today will do that."
1,Upgrade from Quicken 2002,I took ver 2004 out of my computer and reverted back to ver 2002.The 2004 version screen is full of junk that takes up 71% of the screen area. It is designed for novices and financial idiots.My advice is not to buy and hope Inuit come up with a usable version in the future.
4,Much faster than Quicken 2000,I had been using Quicken 2000 for the past few years and decided to upgrade to the 2004 verion. It is a definite improvemnt and runs much faster than my old 2000. I did not have the negative experiences that others have reported. Overall I am pleased with this product.
3,Would like to change to money,I am still using 2003 Deluxe and am not upgrading based on these review.s Have also been extremely unhappy with Quicken's support. I've never been able to get my 401 K's in the system appropriately. The only reason I don't change to Microsoft Money is the Quicken Credit Card download. That interface is so seamless and I don't have to re enter my credit card transactions. I don't think that Microsoft Money has anything like this for their product. It's the only reason I stay with Quicken but have been tempted many times to move to another program.
3,The back up routine is Buggy,"The back up routine is buggy. It leaves a file name Q3.DIR as a stray on your desktop even after you told it to back up to a certain media device elsewhere. Each time you go to back up, a message pops up asking you if you know that there is a file with the same name and do you want to over write it. There is a box you can click if you do not want to see this screen and question again. Clicking this box does nothing.. Other then these few back up problems the program seems to be working ok. I haven't had time to check the math yet but it looks ok. If Quicken 2003 was working ok for you Save your time and money until intuit fixes the few back up bugs and what ever else may come up with this new program. The layout looks the same as the 2003 version with very few changes."
2,"Nice, but many bugs","I will start with the fact that I like the interface. I upgraded from 2000 (which I loved) because Intuit will no longer offer the online features with 2000 (makes me wonder if I'm going to need to buy new software every year). My data converted just fine. Now, however, I cannot access any budget data. Anytime I try to look at my budget, I get a fatal error and the program shuts down. This goes for the ""overview"" information on all accounts as well. I was on the phone with Tech Support, who had me do a ""safe"" install...that didn't work. They ended it by telling me that there is somehting else on my computer causing the problem. Gee, thanks.. Now I cannot seem to go back to 2000.Beware...only upgrade if you cannot live without the online stuff."
1,Do not buy this product.,"I really hate to post this awful review, but it fits. I have used Quicken for 11 years, and been quite happy, most of the time. No more. Quicken 2004's interface is unstable, which is annoying. The real problem is the handling of the data file.From Quicken 2.0 for DOS all the way though Quicken 2003, I've never lost data. Now, with Quicken 2004, Intuit has corrupted my data file 3 times in the last 2 months. I do not have time to re-enter and re-build my data file every month.Goodbye Intuit. I would revert back to Quicken 2003, but Intuit's support is sub-par also. Right now, their site is down. The 800 number needs a credit card to bill too.We'll see how Microsoft handles my data in Money 2004."
1,Good product gone bad,"One star is probably harsh, but having worked on QUicken 98 for six years, this latest release sucks. You can no longer enter investment data directly into the register; must use a pop-up screen that covers up the register.Too much clutter on the screens. Too much information that's not essential.Finally, I now have browser problems that did not exist before the installation of QUicken 2004.SOmebody needs to develop a competitive product."
1,I Wish I had visited here before I bought,"I have Quicken 2004 Primier. It has been a disaster from the first day. I have used Quicken since the DOS version 4. This is the worst software I have ever encountered. On first installation I encounterd some errors culminating with a memory reference error. When I was able to get the program to run, my data was incorrect. I have gone back and forth to Quicken 2001 while I waited for ""Escalated Quicken Support"" to get back to me. But now Quicken 2001 Delux is not supported for Financial downloads. I am again waiting because they lost the last email I sent them. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT."
1,DON'T EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS,I've been using quicken for over 10 years. I recently tried to upgrade from the 2003 version. My data was corrupted and I had to reinstall the 2003 version to get my data back. If you have more than 7 years of data the coversion may be lost with the upgrade. Stick to the 2003 version and save your money. Intuit has absolutely no tech support so good luck trying to get help from them.
4,I like it... No apologies!,"I can't understand the bad rap Quicken 2004 is getting here. I have used Quicken for almost 20 years and this upgrade was both smooth and easy. I really like the new look. More importantly, Quicken 2004 converted my 2001 information flawlessly, and I was up and running in just a few minutes. Sure, the opening screen is very different, but you have to expect that with an upgrade. It took a matter of minutes, not hours to become familiar with the new interface, and I really like many of the new one-click navigation features. I give it 4 stars; the fifth star would have to be earned by the VP in charge of Intuit's almost non-existent tech support staff. I said earlier I have been using Quicken for almost 20 years, but I gave up on its tech ""support"" more than 15 years ago. Too bad, the program itself deserves five stars."
1,"This product is a setback, not an upgrade","I have used some version of Quicken for many, many years. Each time I have upgraded, the product was just a little bit better. I was crazy to upgrade from Quicken 2002. This product is a mess. I have yet to work for more than 15 minutes without it freezing on me. You have to use brute force (the Task Manager) to get it to close so you can start again. The user interface is also a step in the wrong direction --- it is much less intuitive than Quicken 2002. There are many more (though less severe) bugs in the product, but you're better off not buying it and sticking to what you already have."
1,Quicken has really blown it,"I just spent an hour looking at Quicken's Web site to find out why my version of Quicken Deluxe 99 no longer would connect with Quicken's servers to download current stock prices on my holdings only to find out they no longer support my version or Quicken 2000. Unbelievable. Like a gallon of milk, Quicken software should start carrying an expiration date. They offered a ""deal"" to upgrade for $39.95 that I considered but after reading these reviews (they are putting their ads on the user interface? Ugh!) I feel forced to switch to MS Money instead. The decision to no longer support versions of their software that are just four years old has definitely backfired. After 14 years of using Quicken software (started in the DOS days), it's seems time to say adios to Quicken. Thanks to everyone here for warning me!"
2,"No Improvements, Lots of New Problems","I have used Quicken for over 10 years. This version is probably the worst yet. It reserves huge amounts of screen real estate for Quicken advertisements and messages. Two examples of the steps backwards: (1) you can no longer work while downloading information and (2) you cannot suspend your computer while Quicken is running. It says ""Quicken does not support standby mode."" They've changed to user interface for the worst. For example, reconciled items are now grayed out, with no way to change it back to normal. Also, the investment transaction register now doesn't show the comment lines.I have found no substantial improvement. The business features, in particular seem the same or worse.I think Quicken has decided they're a monopology and don't have to try anymore."
3,Guaranteed to loose data if you upgrade...(confirmed by co),"Good program, but *watch-out*You *will* loose any un-accepted transactions if you upgrade. Unfortunately, Quicken does not check for this or warn you. I just confirmed that this is true and reproducible and that they do nothing to prevent or warn about this. For reference, my Intuit support chat session ID for 3/25/2004 10:05 PM EDT is 201086. So be sure to accept all downloaded transactions before you upgrade (which does an uninstall of your last verison). I have reported this as a bug to Intuit and hope for a fix for this data loss bug for all other upgrade users."
1,Absolutely a disappointment,"Started setting up accounts in September of '03. I have LOST all files through file corruption 3 times. The last was tonight at 23:05! Quicken hasno support and has lost my business for good. On-line accounts never balance... I absolutely wonder what is happening to this once fine company... Scarry,I just bought their Tax programme tonight... Hope the same programmers haven't been at work!"
2,I can't believe they how they changed it!,"What happend??? Quicken used to be so great and easy to use. The new 2004 is shockingly different! I would have never upgraded from 2002 if I new how bad the new interface was. I want my old account register back not that thing on the side this whole program should not have been released. I implore inuit to release 2004 in the old style or at least give us choices. No bugs, just a poorly designed program."
1,Saved by Amazon's Customer Reviews,"Have been using Quicken for MANY years. Was tempted to buy Quicken 2004 but after reading the reviews decided to stay with Quicken 2002. It has bugs but at least I know where they are.I recently ordered Quicken checks... What a pain... the on-line software did not work and the first guy that I talked to in India could not speak understandable english. However, the second person was able to help me spend my money.I will never buy another upgrade from Intuit again. I hope that by boycotting them they will get the message. If enough of customers refuse to buy maybe they will do something about their poor quality products and services."
2,Error 1311,I got this software and installed it. Got Error 1311 about not able to read the file. I had a solution to that by copying it to the hard drive and then installing it from there. it installed successfully this time and now I am going to use it and find out how it works..Good luck with the install.
2,Mediocre and getting worse,"Quicken 2004 Deluxe is a big disappointment. I have used Quicken for years now, and recently decided to upgrade from Quicken Deluxe 2002 to 2004. Unfortunately, I have found that the 2004 interface is less elegant, slower, harder to use, and much more confusing.Unless you like lots of screen flickering, windows minimizing and maximizing seemingly beyond your control, and Quicken's nonstandard way to manage the windows in which you're working, then stick with your older version of Quicken, or check out Microsoft Money."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! -10 stars,"This product is worthless. I have used Quicken for 20 years and had vertually no problems but I could not even get this version to install. The help desk was a joke so I threw the disk away. For now I am using Quicken 2002 but I am considering moving to Money. To be honest, I don't like Microsoft anymore than Intuit but at least their product works.Do Not Buy...."
1,An Insult,"This buggy, terrible software is an insult to customers who have been loyal to Quicken all these years (beginning, in my case, in 1988). Once received, nag messages cannot be eliminated (there is a check-box titled ""Do Not Ask This Question Again"" on several features...this does not work, ever), Shortcuts return incorrect responses (e.g.: Ctrl/M - which is supposed to Memorize a Transaction, returns a Search screen), ""Cannot Open Account"" messages appear suddenly and without cause and data can be corrupted. The only improvement over the prior version is the ability to print Reports in color, which was inexplicably eliminated from several versions and which is now back. Tech Support is a bad (and expensive) joke. I used to recommend Quicken to friends...no more. They have failed to maintain any standards. This software is an insult, as I have said, to all of us who paid for it in good faith and tried to stay loyal to the product. The sad things is, they obviously do not care."
1,General Quicken Comment,"I haven't upgraded to Quicken 2004 because it seems, from the reviews I've read here, to be even worse than Quicken 2003, a disappointing product. I had read last year's negative reviews, but upgraded again anyway, especially since I had been a satisfied Quicken user for years. Unfortunately, the negative reviews were right! Besides being sluggish, several standard and necessary functions of the application weren't even included anymore. Intuit basically shrugged. Sadly, the company seems to have lost it's way."
1,Piece of Junk!!!,I just wanted to add my additional comments that this software is absolutely lousy. I've used Quicken since 2000 and the old version crashed occasionally and got used to working aroud it with lots of backups. But this is a new LOW in quality control. Not only does it crash regularly! But it also trashes my data file. I too have spent countless hours trying to resolve the issue constantly restoring my data file and re-entering my data!I actually read that it was full of bugs but Intuit decided to no longer support my older version and I was forced to upgrade.What a piece of junk and what a lousy vendor!
1,Quicken 2004 Deluxe,Buggy software. Crashes on startup just about every time. Couldn't get through to tech support so I switched over to Microsoft Money.
1,Every Year it's WORSE,"Intuit is slowing destroying Quicken. Every year the user interface gets more confusing, etc, the program gets more buggy and the customer service gets worse. Take my advice...if you just want a program to keep your checkbook on, or run a small business on, then try to find a old copy of Quicken for DOS ver8. I have run it with no problems in Win 95,98 and Xp. IT IS MUCH EASIER TO USE THAN THE WINDOW VERSIONS and it actually came with a USER's manual that was one of the best every written. You don't have all the fancy online bill paying, etc of the windows versions, but for basic stuff you will run rings around a Quicken for Windows user. The basic program has not been improved one bit since this version!!! and the manual itself will help you a tremendously if you decide to go with windows version."
1,very unhappy with Quicken and Quicken support,"I have used Quicken since the beginning and have always found it easy to use and install--until I upgraded to Quicken 2004. I purchased a downloaded upgrade, and then my computer died [operating system issue], and I had to reinstall it. You have to call to get a new key, a very frustrating experience. It took several phone calls and being on hold for at least 20 minutes. At one point they wanted to charge me [$24] for getting a new key! Earlier this year, I purchased a copy for my accountant to use, I thought I was getting Quicken Basic but I ended up with New User--which does not allow you to import data--totally useless! I do not need the multiplicity of junk they've thrown in--most of which doesn't work well anyway, so if you have to buy it, buy the cheapest version you can get away with.This will be the last time I buy it."
1,Buggy...disappointing...and NOT for WIN 98,"Wow...16 reviews so far and not one positive. I eagerly bought the '04 Quicken Deluxe...as I have been for the past 5 years...and was extremely disappointed when it crashed my WIN 98 system which had NEVER crashed in 2 years. ""Chatted"" with tech support (since I don't have the $40,000 to talk to them personally on the phone) and they said it was ""intended"" for Win XP. Couldn't even navigate around the program without windows app errors and crashes/reboots. Time after time. Put it on my XP system...and while it seems more stable...seems more cluttered and difficult to use than ever. They had something so good in the late 90s...and in the process of the last 3-4 years...have managed to ruin it. Terrible tech support...buggy software...complicated. I am so disappointed. I have given Intuit a lot of $$$ over the years...I think MS Money 2004 is in my future. Way to lose one more customer, Intuit."
2,I used to love Quicken.... but not anymore.,"Wow, lots of bugs. I have used Quicken since about 1995 I have continued to purchase the latest revision of software to ""keep up"" on things, but I assure you this is the last time. I can't believe a company like Intuit would really allow so many software bugs.Quicken has basically evolved into a bunch of layers on top of layers. As they have continued to make new modules, the modules don't seamlessly fit together - this makes things confusing. Truly, Quicken needs to be redesigned from the bottom-up.I'm switching to Microsoft Money, which will import my quicken data."
1,Do Not Load This Software!,"I've been using Quicken Software since 1991. I've had nothing but problems since loading 2004--it's total disaster. I wish I'd read these reviews before purchasing. It has corrupted accounts dating back to 1991, and I'm having to recreate them. I'm also looking at Money. What a waste."
1,FULL OF BUGS,"I have been a Quicken user since the first version and have upgraded every year. I have never had any significant problems with the software and usually rave about it.I bought the 2004 version and am giving up and going back to the 2003 version. It simply does not work and the technical support is basically non-existent. Now when I try to open it I simply get a message that says ""An error has occurred please restart Quicken"" I get this everytime.This version should never have been released."
1,I can't even boot it up,"I too wish I'd read these reviews.I've been using Quicken for seven or eight years, and decided to upgrade from the 2001 version.The install went smoothly. But when the program tries to start up, I get the same memory error other reviewers refer to. I can't speak to the program's new features because I can't even get it to run.Hoping for a patch or fix, I went to the Quicken Web site. There I found a page indicating Quicken has known of this problem since at least Aug. 28, and that it is ""currently under investigation.""My solution is to reinstall the 2001 version, which has a few annoying bugs [also unfixed] but at least it works. Maybe I'll upgrade to Microsoft Money; in any event, I don't want to risk losing years of data with this buggy Intuit product.I hope I can get my money back.One has to wonder how execs at companies like this sleep at night."
2,Disappointing....,"I can't believe I'm thinking of moving to a Microsoft product (Money). But this version has given me fits, problems with installation, converting, lack of customization, and poor, costly, and slow customer service to deal with these problems. PLUS backing up files are more complicated, and it leaves a little ""gift"" file on my desktop, something which Intuit says its aware of but can't do anything about right now. Capital Gains are impossible to track......so next move... MS MONEY!"
2,Extremely Slow,"Maybe it's the fact that we are still running Windows 98 and have 256 MB RAM, but Quicken 2004 is running extremely slow, and has crashed our computer twice in the four times we have utilized the program. Supposedly it only needs 64 MB RAM and is compatible with Windows 98, but I am questioning that. Yesterday we got a message that we didn't have enough memory before our system crashed. The bugs that we dealt with a couple times a week with 2003 seem to be fixed, but at the rate we're going with 2004, I may be sending it back. I do like the new look which is why I am rating it 2 stars instead of 1."
2,"Buggy, Busy and Annoying","I have been using Quicken for many years. I decided to upgrade the very stable and efficient Quicken 98 on a lark, but soon regretted it. The new user interface is very difficult to navigate, laden with Intuit advertising for other services, and impossible to customize.There are numerous bugs which Intuit seems in no hurry to fix.This software is not in a condition suitable for release. I wonder if the glowing reviews are from Intuit people. I am not certainly a Microsoft person. And I regret the direction that software is taking in this country: shoddy, flashy, and unstable. Intuit is making a big mistake here. They are trying to lock in a guaranteed market base much as Microsoft has done; but as Microsoft, they are releasing products that do not do the job properly. They will engender resentment and eventually lose this loyal customer base.I will not willingly purchase any more Intuit upgrades."
1,Most bugs ever from Intuit,"Don't bother buying Quicken 2004. There are significant bugs that Intuit has not fixed, even after two patch releases since the August release. I've used Quicken since the DOS days, basically about 13 years. If you have Quicken 2002 or 2003, DO NOT UPGRADE to 2004. If you don't have Quicken, check out MS Money first. I've always been a die-hard Quicken fan, but I'm disgusted with Intuit's poor quality in this release. Hopefully they'll keep releasing patches and get this dog fixed soon. If they ever do, I'll post an update. But for now, avoid Quicken 2004 at all costs."
1,GOOD BYE QUICKEN 2004,I am can not express my self how frustrated I was after I had loaded quicken 2004 on my XP system. I have been using 2003 successfully but 2004 version is soo slow. my system is 3.0ghz and 2 gb of ram and I could not believe it how slow it ran. The most ridicules part is that quicken 2004 will not revert database to 2003 version so I have to retype about two weeks of transactions!Need advice - steer away from this product!!! I would not use it even if it was for free!!!
1,Avoid Quicken 2004,"Quicken 2004 has a bug which will affect your computer's system and stop it from going into Standby or Hibernate power saving modes.This is a known bug and has been documented by Microsoft in their Knowledge Base Article. The worst thing is that Intuit knows about the problem from previous versions and has issued updates to fix the older versions but has not incorporated the fix into Quicken 2004.Intuit Tech Support stated that they will fix bugs after users report them. Apparently Intuit expects us to pay for their buggy product, test it, report the problems to them, and maybe they may fix it later."
2,Quicken 2004 is BUGGY!,"I am a ten-year user of Quicken. I downloaded Quicken 2004, converted my data files, and began to use it. Issues I found thus far (I've reinstalled it a second time and the problems are the same):1) I keep getting application faults when I try to do a backup. I have to reenter the program and try again. Sometimes it takes 5-6 tries.2) Frequently, when I load the program, I get an application fault.3) On the investment overview page, there are several checkboxes that allow you to compare your investment returns against market indexes. The checkboxes are permanently disabled -- you cannot select them.4) On the financial overview page, the small version of the net worth graph is completely wrong. When you click the button to expand it, the information is correct.Overall, I am very disappointed in Quicken 2004. Thus far, there are no fixes to download. I never considered using Microsoft Money before, but I am now."
1,Don't even think of upgrading to Quicken 2004,"I'm a long time user of Quicken and generally dislike Microsoft, but this is getting hard to take. I upgraded to 2004 in hopes of fixing some of the problems in Quicken 2003 and instead it got worse. About a month ago, I had to uninstall and reinstall just to get the product to work. Tonight I can't seem to customize reports. When I try, I hangs the program and I have to reboot. I have been fighting this for about three months. Too long, I thought to reenter a bunch of data, but I have rebooted one too many times. As soon as Money 2004 converts Quicken 2004 data, I'm going to give it a try. I know the reviews are bad, but it can't be any worse. If you are using an older version of Quicken don't upgrade even if you get it free with Turbo tax, just don't do it."
1,Maybe even LESS than 1 star!,"I read all of the negative reviews everywhere (Cnet, Epinions, Price Grabber, etc.), but I didn't believe them for some reason. Well BELIEVE THEM!!! I am a PC tech support professional (for over 10 years) with a 2.2Ghz PC with 1.0Gb of RAM, and Quicken 2004 ran like garbage. I've played with MANY beta programs that ran much much better. The app crashed constantly. IT IS NOT STABLE!!!! Read the rest of the reviews, and I agree with ALL of them! Enough said..except...STAY AWAY FROM THIS PROGRAM, IT WILL ONLY GIVE YOU HEADACHES!!!"
1,Be Careful!,"I have been happily using Quicken for a few years now. However, I had to reinstall it after a HD crash, and it cannot be re-registered, and therefore, it cannot be used. BE VERY CAREFUL. Unless you are willing to shell out the additional $80 or so for every upgrade, the program will give out on you. They have designed a very clever marketing ploy to continue getting your money."
1,Quicken continues to disappoint in 2004,"I've been a Quicken user since the early 90s. Loved it in the early years, but as it became more complex, it developed quirks. This latest version immediately locks up my robust XP system if I open a browser and will lock it up after a while even when Quicken is the only program running. The only way to recover is a hard reboot! in XP!!! I used to enjoy tracking my finances, but since v2003 it has become a chore. What's worse, an upgrade still requires that you pay for support. Unless Intuit publishes a fix (and SOON!), this will be my last Quicken version. I'm switching to Money."
4,Overall Good Product,"I almost got scared off by all the terrible, terrible reviews posted here. I'm sure glad I didn't. This product is fine.I have been a Quicken user for about 10 years and was still using the 2000 product. While I was upset that Intuit decided to sunset the ability to download transactions from by brokerage account (as a fairly active trader that's the main feature that I love) I quickly converted my files to the 2004 version and was navigating the very simple (although different looking) user interface, downloading, and processing transaction activity in just under an hour.All of the negative reviews posted here must surely be activity from Microsoft employees hoping to scare people into using Money.I bought this product for $14 from the used and new vendors on Amazon. For $14, this is a very good product."
1,Intuit - Get A Clue,"I am another Quicken user from back in the DOS days. I loved the old Quicken 6 and highly recommended it to everyone. A couple of years ago I upgraded to Quicken 2002. What a terrible user interface, retirement planner and report generater (as compared to Quicken 6). The main good thing about the program was the ability to download financial data.I came to this website to get opinions about the latest Quicken to see if my concerns have been addressed. I guess not. Forced upgrades, i.e. incomplete backwards compatibility. Sorry Intuit - no more money from me until you clean up your act. Clearly you do not currently care about your customers, other than to attempt to take money from their pockets.I think its time for open source financial planning software."
1,Switch to Money! I did.,"I switched to Microsoft Money 2 years ago, after a horrible experience with Intuit's tech support.At first I didn't like the interface as much as Quicken's, but I soon got used to it. In addition, every new version of Money has improved the interface and features to the point that I now prefer Money. Plus, you get a number of free offers with Money, including free bill pay for up to 2 years; that alone pays for more than the price of the software.And don't forget, Money has free tech support. You can download a free evaluation copy from Microsoft's web site.It's too bad, but Intuit seems to have stopped caring about its customers. I wish Andrew Tobias's ""Managing Your Money"" was back."
1,Horrible online support,"I've been using Quicken 2004 for about 9 months now. It was working just fine when I first got it, then problems started arising such as when I wanted to download bank and credit card information, it said that the servers could not be reached. Even stock information won't download. Quicken support is horrible as they only have chat support and after 2 hours on chat with their technical support folks, they had no idea and blamed the financial establishments I deal with. Why is that so when it's worked fine for 9 months, I haven't changed a thing in the configuration and both my credit union and my credit card issuer are BOTH experiencing problems? It's been going on for over 2 months now. A major headache. I whole do not recommend this buggy and poorly supported product. I'm going with Microsoft Money instead."
1,Waste of money. More bugs than you can imagine.,"I used Quicken since 2.0 for DOS and went through multiple updates. This one from Quicken Deluxe 2003 to Quicken Deluxe 2004 is the first big disappointment with Quicken. Some basic functionality like Cash Flow report stopped working correctly. It worked 12 years ago perfectly. It now reports transfers between accounts as Inflow.Example if you pay a credit card bill from a checking ammount it would be considered as your Inflow. There is an option to Exclude Internal Transfers but it does not do anything.The support (I used online chat session) is a joke. They say that data file is corrupt first and that ""the development team is aware of the problem and working on a fix"" after.I am glad that I have a copy of my data file in 2003 format.Do not see any new functionality added since 2003 release.Save your money and skip this release."
1,Apparently Intuit lost focus on quality,"This is sad. I have Quicken 1999 which is, as far as I know, completely bug free. Quicken informed me via a pop-up that I must upgrade to 2004 or some online features will no longer work. After reading the reviews, no way. Unfortunately this is becoming the new reality. American companies are shipping jobs overseas to save money. It is happening in more and more industries, especially including the software and service industries. I seriously doubt that Quicken is programmed in the USA anymore. Maybe someday Intuit will figure out that they relinquished control of their product and product quality when they shipped it overseas. Until then I will stick with the 1999 version and forego the online transactions. Sad."
1,Awful.,"I'm not sure why I decided to pick this book up. I had tried to read another Ed Lee book, CREEKERS, and couldn't get past the first couple of chapters before I threw it down. Maybe it was the cover. It shows a screaming creature and a figure carrying a body through a cemetery. If nothing else I hoped it might be fun in a drive-in, b-movie kind of way. After all, I love horror novels--even the cheesy ones if they are fun. Well, GHOULS isn't even good in a bad way. It was just awful. Hopelessly juvenille, mysogonistic, pointlessly gory, and full of characters that talk like they are on some grade school playground. And to make matters worse, it's 444 freakin' pages. Don't waste your time. You'll end up like me: pissed off and feeling cheated."
4,A great pickup,"I bought this because I am a youth leader and though it would be something to pull ideas from. I was quite suprised how truly good this book is. I Have find myself really getting deeper with this.This is my second book by yaconelli, and he does not disappoint. He is very real and transparent. This book has given me many ideas of discussion with the youth I work with."
3,"Good material, bad design.","I'm a youth pastor who is looking for some devotional material for my teens. Bad design might not be the best term. But the layout of the reading material is literally all over there place. There is stuff to read that is diagonal, sideways, upside down, small print, and large print. The font even changes. This doesn't necessarily mean that teens that read it cannot follow, but I have a difficult time reading a certain section because I try to start reading something else to the side of it, or above, or below, or in front of. It's crazy.The material is great if you can get past all of that. Not everyone can."
1,Broken pieces within 2 days of owning it.,"This toy had so much going for it at first glance: it has a big ""wow"" factor for the price. It comes in a plastic container with handles which makes it a nice travel toy to bring to Grammy's house, a big variety of vehicles, the tank makes noise (WAY too loud) and lights up, lots of soldiers with barricades, etc. The vehicles are made of hard plastic which at first seemed like a good idea but after one day everything started to break. The breaking was not due to rough play although it is reasonable to expect rough play due to the nature of the toy. I cannot recommend this toy due to the lack of durability. I'm throwing it away as I am tired of stepping on sharp pieces of plastic. A waste of money.....just buy the GI Joe's seperately with a vehicle or two."
2,Good Radio But....,"I bought this CD player because of the good reviews I read. The radio portion is great and I am glad I have it because (being an avid exerciser) the CD player is so sensitive that it shuts off everytime I make a sudden movement. I can't use it while running, elipital trainer nor while walking. I get so frustrated with it that I just use it for the radio. If you really want a CD that won't skip, pay the money and get something better.."
2,Panasonic disapointment,I purchaced one of these at a local store and found it to be one of the least functional pieces of equipment that I have ever purchased. The buttons were hard to control and the anti-skip was non-existant. For my purposes I decided to return the item and look for one more suitable to for jogging or exercise.
3,Don't buy this if you have a lot of CD-Rs!,"I have a few thousand LPs that I am recording onto CD-Rs. This CD player will not play roughly 50% of them. I can discern no particular pattern relating to brand of CD, 74/80 minute capacity, etc. If you have a lot of CD-Rs, get a CD player that specifically states that it will read them. By the way, both my hifi CD players can read all the CDs, as can the 4 CD readers and writers on my home computers."
3,An amazing tale! by Lacey,"This is a wonderful story that was truly eye opening. ""To Be a Slave,"" was an excellent story told by slaves about how their lives were like during the Civil War period. These magnificent tales made you feel compassionate and heartfelt. I really liked this book. I would highly recommend it for a historical piece."
1,to be a slave,To Be A SlaveBy: Julis LesterMy book review is about the book To Be A Slave. It is mostly about the slaves and there life styles. This book is also about the punishment of the slaves.My book To Be A Slave. I like this book cause of how it is about real life things and not made up story's. I think that this book is cool cause its about real feelings and punishments.Another reason I like this book is that its not all about how bad the black slaves had it.
5,A Historical Debut!!!,"This band from the city that never sleeps has released an album full of memorable tunes that are straight from the heart. From lyrics that let the listeners learn something about these guys and musicianship that musically enhances the songs. Stand out tunes like ""You Liked It"" with it's funky bass line to ""Slipping Away"" and it's incredible story, makes this album a desert island disk for sure. If you like great songs and great music then BIG BAD ZERO is for you."
3,Another ho-hum pop-alternative band,"I wouldn't say this cd was horrible, but it deifinitely isn't great. It's really nothing special. They have a very generic jangly sound, but I guess if you like bands like matchbox 20 and barenaked ladies that's good. If I could compare them to one band it would be Sponge in the earlier days. The music is ok, but often embarassingly poppy, and the lyrics are purile at best. If you like alterna-pop then buy it, but if you're looking for a rock band don't waste your money like I did."
5,A superb blend of instrumental and vocal,"To begin with, I've been a fan of Mike Oldfield since he sang folk songs with his sister Sally. Islands is half and half - the first half instrumental, and the second, vocal, light rock. The instrumental is a rich tapestry of harmonies with frequent changes of pace. Some of the changes are abrupt, but when you listen the second time you understand the thematic potential within the change. The vocal portion is a marvelous blend of strong rhythm and vocals. Listen closely to the words as well as the melody. There are some fun surprises. Islands, the title vocal, and the final cut on the CD, is a comentary on human nature and the need for others. Definitely not fluff. Islands is, I think, the first album by Oldfield released in the US containing lyrics. It is a wonderful promise of what is to come."
1,Stranded on an Island,"This is a shockingly bad album. The instrumental piece veers off in a different direction every one and a half minutes, and the singles are characterless, mid-eighties pop. To think that this was written by the man who wrote such classics as ""Ommadawn"", ""Hergest Ridge"" and ""Tricks of the Light"" brings tears to my eyes."
2,"Oh, no....","Don't start your Oldfield collection with this pls! This is not classic Oldfield, and this is not Discovery or Five Miles Out! Althought it has some great tracks (not the instrumental ones unfortunately) it's one of his weakest efforts. The 2 stars R 4 Magic Touch only."
3,Worth it for at least one cut.,I prefer Mike Oldfield's long instrumental pieces. I liked Wind Chimes as included some differnt touches including a drum and a pipe organ solo. The rest of the album is made up of the shorter rock cuts. If you like Mike Oldfiedls' rock you will like this. If you are like me and prefer the instrumentals this one is worth having for WInd Chimes.
4,One of MO's better works,"I have been a fan of Mike Oldfield's for decades and find this CD well worth adding to my collection. I have several favorites off of this CD including North Point. If you like Ommadawn, or Voyager then this CD will fit right in."
2,"Horrible, but maybe it seemed OK at the time","The instrumental track is OK, but nothing special compared to the brilliance of ""Amarok"", ""Five Miles Out"", or even ""QE2"". It's the only thing that saves this album from getting 1 star, though.The pop songs exhibit the worst of the mid-80s, with bombastic power pop cheesiness and overwrought ethereal ballads. ""Magic Touch"" is so awful and formulaic it makes me cringe to hear it. ""The Time Has Come"" could be an old ABBA song put through too much reverb, and is the best song on the album, so that should give you an idea what the rest is like.Fortunately, Mike Oldfield seemed to start to drag himself back from the mire with the next release, ""Earth Moving"". If you want Oldfield pop songs, get that album first."
2,"Oh, no...","Don't start your Oldfield collection with this pls! This is not classic Oldfield, and this is not Discovery or Five Miles Out! Althought it has some great tracks (not the instrumental ones unfortunately) it's one of his weakest efforts. The 2 stars R 4 Magic Touch only."
3,oh well,"best song on album would have to be islands being the hardcore bonnie tyler fan i am. must say tho i was really disappointed mike didnt release the orginal nights on fire, this was sung by bonnie but he changed it. silly dude he was"
3,Wind Chimes,"The Wind Chimes is a really great instrumental piece, but the popsongs, are rather boring !"
1,wrong item,"ordered this as someone said I needed it to make my VCR work with my TV, but it wasn't the right thing. I had to open it, for it to be connected & now I'm stuck with it as you can't returned opened items."
3,You gotta know what it does......,"It is a good product don't get me wrong, but make sure this is what you need. this device converts AV (INPUT with the three cables)SIGNAL AND CONVERTS IT INTO COAXIAL(OUTPUT). in other words, you will be able to connect you play station to your grandma's tv."
2,Only worked for 6 months,"This item worked great - for 7 months, then it died without warning. My experience with Monster products has been better than this. Buyer beware."
2,"Worked For A Short Time, Then Quit","I needed this to connect my DVD player to an old TV in the garage. The hookup was pretty logical, but I followed the directions anyway. After starting to play a DVD it worked great for about 5-10 minutes. Then the signal started getting lost and finally quit altogether. The ""Signal"" indicator would not light up as it should when receiving an input. I tried different combinations (75/300 ohm; channel 3/channel 4, etc). At first, I suspected that the DVD player was at fault. So I brought it into the house and hooked it up to a different TV using the same cables as in the garage. It worked fine. I am returning this unit for a refund (the only option) and will order a different brand.After reading the previous reviews, I would not go so far as to not recommend this product. I may have just been unlucky enough to receive one of the few defective ones."
4,An interesting band. Sure worth a listen.,"Bellevue Cadillac has a winner here in ""Prozac Nation."" Great swing arrangements combined with some of the most interesting, thought provoking lyrics of the late 90's. A couple of weak tunes keeps this one from being 5 stars, but you'll still be glad you bought it. By the way, there is a track 13 not listed on the cd cover about 2 minutes after track 12. Be sure you find it. It's one of the best songs on the cd."
3,Better price other places,I have no complaints about this product. It works good. But I did find it cheaper at are local Menards a few days later. So if you are looking to save some money this might not be the place to buy it.
5,Kill-a-Watt,"Great product - within a month, I had a very clear idea of how much the large appliances (and my computer) were costing me, and was able to save the cost of the appliance (about $30 USD) within 3 months. Figure out how much that TV, freezer, computer, or vacuum is costing you. Highly recommended."
3,Jonathan Davis,"Seems to work, Steady state Values are within 10% of a $1000 meter. No peak/surge measurements."
2,Problem,"I am now into on my fourth P3. All the good comments made are accurate. It does what it is supposed to. But after a while, the voltage becomes inaccurate, it reads higher than it actually is. I cannot tell if the other readings are still accurate as I have no way of checking these. I have had to return two units to the dealer and the same thing is happening to another one I now have in use."
5,Great Gadget,I love this gizmo. Well made. Easy to use. Very accurate as compared to quality DMM's. Very affordable and simply fun and educational to use.
3,small plug,"Works like it should, draw back is the plug seems to small, takes a lot of force. Don't see it surviving to many plug in's."
5,A Good Product!,I am pleased with this device. It's really nice to know how much juice something is taking to operate.
4,KILL-A-WATT,"THIS IS A VERY INFORMATIVE INSTRUMENT. IT IS VERY HANDY FOR DETERMINING POWER USAGE OF APPLIANCES. THIS COULD ALSO BE USED FOR ANY ONE WANTING TO GO SOLAR BECAUSE IT REALLY ALLOWS YOU TO SEE THE OVERALL ELECTRICAL USAGE OF ANY APPLIANCE.I HAD AN OLDER REFRIGERATOR I THOUGHT WAS USING UP A LOT OF POWER NEEDLESSLY, BUT AFTER LEAVING IT HOOKED UP TO THE KILL-A-WATT FOR A WEEK, I FOUND THAT IT REALLY DIDN'T USE MUCH AT ALL. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
2,Put in a god damnned backlight!,"This does the job it's supposed to... it's very useful for figuring out where you're burring power and what you can do to improve your electricity bill...., however I find I have to searching for a flashlight whenever I use this. The typical use is to plug it in at the wall, which is typically down low, under tables/desks, behind fridges, etc. All those places are dark and reading an LCD screen without a back-light will drive you crazy!While I like the basic function of this product, I curse the designers every time I use it for not including a back-light."
2,Disappointed,"Was disappointed, there where no instructions included with the product. I went to the web site and what they had was hard to understand."
2,Aceptable Kill A Watt P4400,"This team worked for a year, after the measure failed. I did this team calibration several times and the problem return.Example: My tester measure 115vac and kill-a-watt 137vac.Measures vol, Amp, watt, power factor with nothing connected.Point very Negative: The clock run without load connected, this not save the data, the screen is hard for read, block the other electric outletand and support tecnichal is terrible."
4,works good if u understand it,our electric company has raised our rate a penny per kilo watt hour. This dose not sound like much but if my TV uses 200 kw an hour then it cost me $2 to watch 2 hours!This Kill-A-Watt reader is great for showing me where my power hogs are in the house.The only problem I have with it is that it was a little hard to understand. I wish that the instructions were easier to read and understand what the numbers mean.This reader showed me that my energy saving light bulbs still rack up a lot of power! and so dose my laptop which I was always told used a LOT less power then a desk top.
3,Poor physical design,"Plugging the device into a wall outlet takes up both outlets. If they would have simply offset the prongs a half inch closer to the edge you would have been able to use the other outlet.The device's watt resolution is 1 so the smallest watt usage it will display is 1 watt. Why does this matter? A PlayStation 3 even when it is ""off"" uses some energy still. The Kill A Watt fluctuates between 0 and 1 watt on the display to show this energy usage. Most of the time showing 0 watts. If the PS3 is using just under 1 watt, over the course of a year that will come out to 1 watt * 24hrs * 365 days = 8760 watt hours or 8.7 kwh per year. The exact value of course is not known because of the lack of better resolution.Otherwise the other features as others have mentioned work well."
3,"Good meter, poor (unlighted) readability","Good unit - does what it says it will do ... but the ""readability"" of the unit could be improved with a lighted display."
3,Documentation sucks,Now that I have the Kill-a-Watt I found the instructions to be incomplete and too brief to be of use to anyone who does not understand what is being measured. I don't want to have to take a course in electricity to learn how to save energy.
1,Works just fine...but didn't work for long.,"Upon testing a new appliance, this gadget produced the following numbers:Volts: 115.2Watts: 268Amps : 3.08The standard calculation is Amps X Volts = Watts. Using the standard calculation, the numbers returned are:3.08 amps X 115.2 Volts = 354.81 wattsSo which is the correct number, 268 watts or 354.81 watts?Update: As noted in the comments section, power factor has to be taken into consideration with 120 volt electrical sources. Review updated - this gadget works just fine.Update: Died a horrible death today while testing a window air conditioner rated at 1110 watts (120 volts). This is no where near the 15 amps / 1800 watt rating of the gadget."
2,Bad design - did the engineers even use this themselves?,"The concept of this device is great. But the reason for the low ratings is that this particular model is designed in a way that limits where you can plug it into or next to. This is because of the location of the three pronged plug on the back of the device (i.e. it is too far away from the bottom of the device).So, I cannot plug it in if there is already something else plugged into one of the outlets! Are you kidding me?You will also have problems with certain surge protectors, depending on how they are designed.So, my question is, did the engineers even use this product?I need to research other devices like this, because I know they make ones that fit it more situations. If anybody has any suggestions, I would love to hear them."
3,"Good shipper, so-so product.","No problem with the shipper. The product came early and as advertised. I didn't find the product as automatically user-friendly as I thought it would be from other reviews. A user-friendly manual would have been nice, but paperwork was sadly lacking."
5,Great Product,"This monitor is really helpful to provide the power usage profile of all the appliances in your home, especially for me, a college student whose utility bill burden is really heavy. With its help, I save a lot on bill and learn things like you should unplug your microwave oven and TV even its not working. The only negative thing is that its bulkiness usually makes the two close wall outlets only one usable."
4,Just as described,"Item works just as described. As other reviews noted, it would be better if this item had a short extension cord to the wall, so you could pick up the item to hold in a manner making it easier to read the LED readout screen (if you remove from the wall/plug, it loses all data, so must be read while inserted in power socket). You can accomplish the same by using your own short ext. cord. Otherwise, it is fine."
5,Kill A Watt,Wonderful product. Works as advertized. Helps in finding how much current is being used.You can monitor energy usage on a lot of different things.
3,Does what I need well.,Purchased it as an inexpensive voltage and Hz monitor devices for my portable generator.Does the job well.Certainly a lot less expensive than a multi tester that has Hz capabilities.
1,"Great device, but 100% failure rate after 16 months","I bought 4 of these altogether, and found them very useful for measuring electrical loads. However, 2 of them have failed -- the LCD display goes blank. Fortunately, the device is passive, so that attached appliances continue to run, but the information is lost. One of my failed P4400s was returned to Amazon for credit, but another one failed after Amazon's 30-day limit on returns. I wrote P3 International, but they never responded. Although I love the device, any manufacturer who doesn't respond to a customer inquiry like this gets an automatic 0 stars (1 in Amazon's system).Update -- all 4 have now failed with the same symptoms."
1,Did not work,The product I got did not work. The meter I got would flash random numbers up to 3000+ watts whether or not anything was plugged into it. The volt function worked correctly. I sent it back 3 weeks ago and I am still waiting for a refund from the Batterycenter.
1,Failed before 12 hours of operation,"The Kill A Watt P4400 ceased to function before 12 hours of continous operation @ 10.3 amps. Screen went blank. Won't even pass electricity through the outlet. In this design it appears that all of the power is passing through the electronics - not a passive failure. I recommend that P3 consider a redesign using a shunted or inductive circuit so that power is not interupted even when the electronics fail. Fortunately, nothing perishable was being serviced by the Kill A Watt. Lesson learned.The product return was very easy through Amazon."
5,Extremely Useful!!!,"Easy to use to the point of being very intuitive, this is an extremely useful device for sorting out the energy hogs from the energy efficient items in your home."
2,"Worked great, while it lasted...","I have used this for a couple years to monitor my usage on several appliances including a/c units, tv's, stereos, computers and found it very informative and even educational. One day while using it simply as a voltage monitor in an unused outlet, I saw the reading begin to climb from 125V to 157V - I was able to confirm with several other meters that this was incorrect. There is no way to recalibrate the device - all the readings and measurement capabilities of the unit are worthless now. One could argue that I got $17 of utility out of the device.... but then it really should have lasted more than 2 years of intermittent use as well."
5,Awesome device to save money; had to write my own calculator to help with the math,"The main reasons I love this device are the price and the fact that it easily pays for itself and more. You will help to identify your energy use, and once you understand your energy use in terms of $$$, you will have the initiative to conserve. Knowing is half the battle!The device is super easy to use -- plug a device in and go. If you are in a tight space, yes, it can be difficult with the shape of the device but an extension cord will fix this.To get the Kill A Watt measurements into device costs, you need to do some calculations. These aren't neccessarily easy to do, and can be time consuming if you are using it often. I put a Kill A Watt calculator on my webpage to help with this since I found myself using this device so much. The calculator will tell you the cost per hour, day month, year and every 50 years. Check it out at: [...]"
3,Pretty good but...,"This device measures O.K., but the stupid design uses one outlet and blocks the use of the second outlet. Really dumb!"
4,"Good, practical device",This useful device has allowed me to identify my more intense electricity users at my house.It will easily repay its cost.I recommend using a small extension cord with it to make reading it's display easier.
5,"Fun, fun, fun!","If you are like me and fret over every wasted watt of energy, then this gadget is for you. It is very simple to use and seems fairly accurate. Mostly it is confirming what I suspected about most appliances like, how much power is that TV really using when it is on or off....The only drawback to the design is that the unit will take take up both plug spaces in a normal duplex plug outlet. The body of the unit hangs down too low and interferes with the lower plug. I use the unit with an extension cord to get around the issue.For about $20 you can't go wrong and it will repay for itself in savings that you will make by realizing what to cut back on. I highly recommend it."
4,Very useful,I purchased this product to check amp usage on an aircompressor. It works very well and is straighforward to use.
4,Cool device!,"Pros: Works well, many readouts, very interesting to see what your home electric devices cost to run.Cons: Display is hard to read. It could use a backlight and a battery backup. All data is lost if you lose power to your house."
4,"Great value, great information, restricts other plug in the outlet, can be hard to read LCD","I like the functionality - it gives you a lot of good information at a low price. After using it, I would be willing to pay a little more for one with a backlit display and battery-backup version. It is hard to read the LCD in dark nooks (where you are typically plugging things in) and you can't unplug it without losing your data. Also, unless you install an extension cord to the unit, you will have to unlplug a second device in an outlet because the size of the unit blocks the other receptacle."
5,Find your energy wasters!,"This was worth every penny! Check to see how much energy your items are using, even when they are off! Worth every penny, you will easily pay for it in the savings you will find!"
4,Handy little gadget,"This tool will answer power consumption questions eg Should I leave the computer on when I'm not using it? Or, How much electricity does my TV use when it's on or when it's off? (They need to make one for 220 volt use also. This is limited to 15 amps at 115 volt appliances.)"
5,Kill-A-Watt,This is a very useful gadget for those wanting to reduce their electric bills. Very easy to find out were the waste is and eliminate it! I highly recommend this device for anyone wanting to get a handle on the energy consumption in order to move to alternative energy such as Solar or Wind as well as just lowering their bill!
5,Kill A Watt,"Everyone needs this monitor. When complaining about the cost of power bills you might be shocked to find out how much your are paying just for technology you have plugged in around your house and not being used. As Vice Chair of the Efficiency and Conservation Sub Committee for the State of Alabama we are looking at implementing a technology call ""GreenSwitch"". GreenSwitch will turn off all lights, turn up or down theromstats, and turn off all electrical outlets when you are not home or ""retired for the night"". We were absolutely shocked at how much ""vampire power"" is being ""sucked"" out of hour homes. The DOE says this is 10%-15% of our powerbills. We highly recommend all states adopt this technology. It is simple and it works. Everyone knows how to turn a switch on or off. That is all you have to do with this technology (GreenSwitch).Stan J. TrottPermanent Joint Legislative Committee on EnergyState of Alabama"
3,Just adequate,"Yes. You plug it in. It shows how much energy you're using. Assuming you can crawl down on the floor, and read the recessed LCD display, in some corner where there's no light.Also, it's pretty big and bulky, and will likely render the second outlet less available to other devices, too.All in all, there are better options at similar prices."
1,Directions??,"The idea behind this product is a good one. I discovered it in a newspaper article and immediately ordered it. The problem is the newspaper had more info on how to operate than the directions that came with the Kill A Watt.Really..unless your an electrical engineer, I wouldn't bother. The directions are a mess.......and I bought it for a gift. Of course, I had to cut out the newspaper article and include it."
3,Doesn't calculate anything,"Despite the listing claiming it ""Calculates electricity expenses by the day, week, month, or year"", it does no such thing, merely tallying up total amount of electricity passing through it while it is plugged in. If you want it to calculate, you have to get the next one up, P4460, for a few dollars more. Maybe they will change the description since I'm returning this one pointing out out the error.Otherwise it seems to work OK, though the placement of the plug could hardly be worse: will block the other outlet in a double outlet. Would have been easy enough to move the plug down a bit."
4,"P3 P4400 Kill-a-Watt works fine, no problems","The P4400 works fine, it does what you expect it would do. It would be nice if it could store in memory for a few seconds the data that it gathers so that you do not need to view its screen while it is plugged in (such as when the outlet is in an awkward location). Also, the black LCD readout is difficult to read in low-light situations (if you use a flashlight, it's fine) -- it would be nice if it had a lit display (not permanently lit, because that could be annoying in certain instances). For the price, I would not trade any of its features for one of these other attributes, and I would not want to pay more for these additional features, so it suits me fine."
1,Don't buy,The watt meter worked fine for three and a half months and then went bad.There was nothing on the display and no electricity would flow through it. I recommend not buying this particular unit. I bought the next model up (4460) and hope to have better luck with it.
4,Nice Features,"I bought this to make double check our Christmas display. I like all the little features and I love being able to switch between voltage current and wattage with the push of a button. This is effortless compared to using a multimeter.The front socket (the side you plug you device to/ on the front of the unit) is a bit tight. Also a few times I got sparks when plugging in devices. Not terrible the sparks were not across the lines but were due to the difficulty of plugging anything into the socket. On the flip side, if you plugged this into a device for long term power measurement, that tightness is great. I was testing Christmas lights.When I was using this as a multimeter I found that I liked using it with an extension cord because I could not unplug the device without ripping the P3 off the wall.Overall a handy little product for measuring you AC connected devices."
3,Upgrade features,"Nice well thought out design. However, it could use a lighted display for viewing because all places don't give visible access. Memory or holding display for a period of time would help upon removing meter from dark areas. A short extension should be included as some recepticles are small and other appliances have to be unplugged to use the meter."
5,Excellent product,"Does just what it claims to do, and does it very well. Very large, easy to read display. I just plug something into it, leave it for a few hours/days, and come back for the readings. It can be hard to position in some outlets, spaces, but a short extension cord (like the 12"" ones designed to be plugged into power strips) works fine. Invaluable tool for tracking how much juice things drain over time."
5,Surprising how revealing this unit is......,I didn't know that this was still available. It may encourage saving electricity. I plugged my son's PS3 into it. Just push the on button and watch the wattage jump.
4,Kill-A-Watt is OK,This is a useful product that could be made even more useful. It lacks illumination for the display and has no memory so that everything disappears when the power is removed. Addition of these two features would be a very good thing.
4,Didn't Break on 230/240 v,"I use regular 110v plugs (with 230v running through them) to hook up my computer systems, to save the hassle of buying new plugs for each one. I accidentally plugged it into one of those plugs and have used it a dozen times since without it breaking. As always ymmv but just thought I would let people know in case they were curious, as it is only rated for 110v"
5,Really helped me realize how much energy I was using,"I run my computer for about 16 hours ever day, which is about 144 kWh per month (average 300W draw). In my area, that's around $10 per month just to run a computer."
1,Kill-A-Watt Display did not work,"While monitoring electrical usage is a great idea, this product clearly did not work. Display is very dark. Could not read the results. After contact with the manufacturer tech, the only help they could give me was to send it back."
5,Really Amazing,I moved into a new apartment when I got my first months electric bill...$275 bucks!?!?! I couldn't believe it. Thanks to this gadget I discovered I had faulty wiring on one of my plug sockets.. the outlet was using constant juice with no appliances plugged in! This thing was a life saver...not bad for $20 bucks!-TexasxTumbleweed
2,Does the job,"This is a simple & affordable unit that you plug your 120v appliances into and get various electrical information.Works well, look for better prices on other sites, I've seen it for $16.There are 2 problems with the Kill-A-Watt:1. It only works for 110-120VAC, not for 220-240VAC.2. When plugged into a double outlet wall plug, it is so large that it will not allow anything else to be plugged in on the other socket."
1,"P4400 Kill A Watt - Great device, Quality is suspect","The P4400 Kill A Watt is a very useful device for measuring the power consumption of appliances. It measures volts, amps, watts and watt-hours exactly as advertised. Unfortunately mine failed after about 6 weeks with an open circuit condition and no reading on the display. Apparently the unit is under engineered or under built since others have also reported the same issue. It is probably OK for light duty occasional use but nothing more than that, and not in a critical application."
4,Nice little tool,"It does what it says it does but pull out your calculator so you can put the data in context. My two immediate uses were to determine how much more my Plasma TV consumed power versus my LCD and LED TVs. Although my lasma is a great TV the new LCD/LEDs now rival it and use less energy to boot. The other immediate use was to determine the level of Backup UPS I needed to support my desktop, display, cable modem, router, and cordless phone. Getting the data I needed for this was within minutes. Very nice tool!I would give it 5 stars if it incorporated a simple calculation given the answers to a couple of questions ( hours / day of use and $/kwh). Of course, you can leave this device hooked up to a appliance for days, monthsm etc. and get the first one your self but why wait :-)."
5,Kill A Watt,Works just as advertised. I am using this tool to verify my power usage for components in my house as I prepare to go off the grid.
1,Gone in 60 seconds,The device stopped working a few short moments after it was plugged into the wall. Buy at your own risk.
3,"Useful, but","Does what it says it will and will help us understand our power usage. However, with the display set flat in the surface, it is hard to read when in use. Think that most wall plugs are down low, or at best, at counter level. In each case the viewer must bend to align their view with the display. A display tilted upward would be an improvement."
5,p4400,This seems to work well. I'm still testing it on different devices to check for current draw. will know more later.
3,Mostly works...but with issues,"I bought this looking forward to finding the little energy leaks. I got it and it seems to work except that when I plug it in, before any load is on it, it is already registering 3 Watts. I called P3 tech support and they told me that is not right, return it. So I go through that song and dance....and the replacement is doing the same thing. If you want to know how much current your lamps and big things are pulling I trust the readings. On the very small items, I have real doubt. I will call tech support one more time before I return the 2nd one."
4,Great little monitor,I love this for the simple fact that you can find out how much power your devices are actually using. The only downfall with this product is that is takes up both standard outlet spaces in order to use it. But I mostly only check things temporarily anyway. It's also difficult to use in places like behind a desk or entertainment center but extension chords help with that problem. All in all a great little tool for those who are curious.
3,"Useful, but awkward","Device needs a backlit LCD and an integral stubby extension.Is hard to read display in shade. Hard to connect devices to it in difficult to reach receptacles. Wattage display not stable. Easier to read amps and multiply by volts for correct wattage. Otherwise, good value for the price."
4,Watt is that appliance doing?,"It seems that everyone is trying to cut their power usage, and I'm no exception. This little device is about as simple to operate as it gets. Just plug it in and let it work for a day or so. It gives you all the electrical data you can use and with a spreadsheet and your utility bill, you can quickly see which appliance is hogging the meter.Be warned, however, that the Kill A Watt will not work on your 220 volt appliances like water heaters and dryers. For that you will have to read the specs and do some crystal ball work.My only criticism of the device is that when you unplug it all the collected data is lost. A battery backup for the data would be nice."
4,Good tool.,It is a easy to use monitor. Really knows what equipment are the most that impact your utility bill.
4,Great price... very useful.,This item has helped me reduce energy usage significantly.I have 2 in use now.Only limitation is that it resets if there is a power failure.I had a power failure after 10 days logging my refrigerator and had to start the log over. A backup battery for the log would be an improvement.
5,Monitor your electricity use,"Good sturdy product, the describtion states it all. The item will monitor powe consumption which is why I bought it to see how much money I am spending on 'standby' mode."
4,p 4400 Kill A Watt,"Good device, helps get a grip on phantom electrical draws. Only way device could better is if you could plug it in to one wall plug and still use the other one at the same time."
5,Just as Expected,"Item works great, Just as expected. We use it for our big rig trucks that use electricity between shifts. To keep track of how much they are using and how much we are being charged. Just plug it into the wall, plug in the item your measuring into the killawatt monitor. In an hour you have your electricity usage. Multiply that by your electrical company's rate and the rest is history. We've had it for a couple of weeks now and we are so happy we bought it. Thanks to Amazon for always providing the best possible price for hard to find items :)"
4,"Great product, a few limitations, but functions as advertised","This is a great product for measuring the electricity use of various items around the house. As this product does do everything advertised and I do approve of those features, I think its really only worth mentioning its few limitations. The product only functions when plugged into a power source, and the second it is unplugged, it loses its readings. So note that there is no memory. The newer model does have that feature. Due to that limitation in this, you'll be hard-pressed finding use for the device with appliances using inconveniently located wall outlets. Also, it would have been nicer if the measuring unit for Kwh went into the triple decimals instead of just two decimal places. As such, appliances like laptops or smaller electronics will require the device to be left measuring electricity usage for hours at a time.Other than that, the product does seem to measure electricity usage accurately (I tested against a 100w light-bulb)."
5,Checking real porduct electrical usage,"I used this device to check tv's, computers, lights, and many other appliances. sometimes i was shocked to see how much wattage was being used when they were supposed to be turned off. my cable box uses almost as much electricity off as it does turned on. so does my tv's. a useful product for checking to total use of all items use of electricity in your home. easy to use and fast results"
4,Love it!,"Love it. It works great and has given me invaluable information on how much energy the items in my house use. I'm especially glad I also ordered a 1' extension cord with it though, as without that it would be a pain to use it in most outlets. If it came with the extension cord (or an installed cord) it would get 5 stars from me."
5,Saved $60/month And Growing,"Imagine my amazement to find out that an old, slow computer was using 250 watts at standstill, continuously, costing me nearly $35/month in electrical use. To contrast, Apple's most energy efficient model the Mac Mini operates at 20 watts! That's like a light bulb, not a computer! That means running the old computer was costing me $420 / year. Little insights like this are helping me to redesign (slowly but surely) how I use energy throughout the home and office."
4,Entertaining and Profitable,"Until you actually use this product you cannot imagine how much or how little electricity any one appliance uses. If you know your utility rate you can easily transcribe the energy use into dollars and cents. This information can change your energy use. This meter is extremely easy to use. As others have noted its major failing is the lack of a battery to store its information, even for a short period of time. What this means is you have to read the numbers while it is plugged in to the appliance you are testing... no matter how inconvenient that is. A backlight on the display and a short term battery backup would provide better user interface. Even with that shortcoming, I bought one for a gift and one for myself. My sons have already borrowed mine. May have to buy another one for myself."
4,Want to measure your carbon footprint?,"This is an interesting product. I use it for general curiosity, finding out how much energy a computer uses is quite eye opening. Another good use for it is properly sizing backup power supplies. You may find that you need a smaller (or larger) one than you are using now, and this will help you explore that.It is pretty unattractive (looks like it was designed back in the 70s), and the display is not super easy to read. But, it does work as intended."
4,Kill-a-Watt is OK,"I have used Kill-a-Watt for about a month and it performs perfectly. It provides a lot of data on electrical usage, but it doesn't have a way to input costs per kilowatt. This requires a manual calculation (simple) and getting cost data from your power bill. It helps me find the high power uses (except built-in lines and 220 volt items) and hopefully be able to save me some money."
3,Good for measuring power consumption,"Works well for measuring average kWh consumed, very easy to use. Can also measure running power consumption in watts or amps, as well as voltage. Main shortcoming is that the response is slow, so it can't determine current surges such as occur on motor startup for refrigerators, compressors and the like, which is important for estimating backup generator needs, for example."
5,P3 International P4400 Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor,"Handy dandy and helpful!! After checking usage on some of my lights and appliances, we decided to unplug some of them. We also swapped out some of our light bulbs for energy efficient ones. ! Everyone should have one of these. It is a real eye opener!!!"
5,Great Product,"It takes the mystery out of the cost of electricity on most electrical appliances and devices.First, find out the cost for your electricity service (per Kilowatt / hour) -- check your bill.Plug the Kill-A-Watt into the wall outlet and plug the device you want to monitor into the Kill-A-Watt. Let it run for a while to collect the data, then multiply the measured KWH by the rate from your service and you have the total cost to run this device for the measured time period.Note that the Kill-A-Watt is limited to devices that use 120V 15A service. This includes most appliances in the home with the notable exceptions of electric clothes dryers and electric ranges."
4,Affordable way to monitor your electricity usage,"This meter is a very affordable and easy way to help you identify electricity savings opportunities in your home. My favorite example was seeing that my cable set-top box / DVR uses 42 W of electricity, even when it is ""off."" Since it runs essentially continuously, this translates to 368kWh a year or about $50 w/ my local prices. Certainly lets you understand the true cost of running various ""essentials"" in your house.My only concern is that the unit is very light and plugging in devices into the device socket seems somewhat flimsy. Probably OK with care, but the product certainly doesn't strike me as completely robust."
2,"Does what it says, but form factor / design is horrible.","The product does what it says it does and meters power consumption, as well as is useful for telling if power to an outlet is fluctuating if you watch it real-time.My biggest problem with this device as well as the other version of it is that it turns one power-plug into two. With a simple design modification this could have been easily overcome. In addition to it wasting an outlet, you also really need a 6"" to 12"" extension cord to really integrate this into systems for monitoring current consumption. Having to daisy chain extension cords or power strips though... this product just creates potential trip and fire hazards as well as clutter your space.On a plus side I guess.. the very poor form design may help you reduce power because you have only one outlet to use vs. two."
3,"Useful, but not a ""quick fix""","This gadget does exactly what it was designed to do: deliver information about the electrical usage of a specific device or collection of devices. For the average user, however, the information is almost useless without a full set of instructions as to how to use it."
3,"Haven't tried it, but ...","I was considering buying one, but after loookling (and not finding) any warranty information on Amazon, I went to the manufacturer's site and found it. Only 6 months! I would never buy something with so wimpy a warranty. To me that means it is not likely to last."
5,"What's ""International"" about it?","What's ""International"" about it? Reading the spec page, appears it only works with 115VAC appliances. Normally ""international"" means dual voltage...115 and 220."
3,nice product (could use some extra features),"the product works well, however a few 'extras' would be nice :- RS232 Serial out for long term monitoring or off line calculations.- LED backlight (for viewing at night)"
3,Takes a bit of work!,"And time, to get to understand this product but it does seem to give you an accurate understanding of you energy use. I bought it along with a smart strip."
3,Kind of ok,"This basic model gets the job done, but it is, indeed basic. There are two things about it that make it less useful than it could be.First, because it lacks a cable (something that comes with a slightly pricier version), it can be awkward to use. It doesn't fit in someplaces, and it may be all but impossible to look at the display in others. So, be sure you'll be able to plug it and look at the display where you want to use it, or get some sort of extension (or even a more expensive model).Second, it only works around 115V."
3,Lacks a few features,"I purchased this product so I can determine what size generator I would need to power various essential loads in my home during a power outage. The device itself works well, but lacks a few features that would make it better. Namely, this device needs a memory function to give you the maximum, minimum and average values for your current draw and watt usage. Perhaps there is another device that has these features out there."
4,Delivers basic performance for the price,"As noted by other reviewers, the P3 should have been designed to not cover two outlets and would be better with a short extension cord to allow better placement for readability. But it does deliver power used over tested time, which is what I purchased it for. Advertizing power consumed per week or month, etc. is misleading as either you leave the single device plugged in for the full period, or calculate the proportion constant to get the desired period. Not a hardship, but misleading copy.Decent value for its intended purpose."
5,"Great Product, quick shipping",This thing is great! I've been using it to monitor my electric consumption for certain personal appliances in my house so that I can be more accurate about how much I pay for my portion of the electric bills (I live with roommates). It's awesome for just looking at how much electricity is being used on various appliances for long periods of time.
4,"Interesting, but still a toy... :)","It does exactly what it says it does. Very cool. But in all honesty, it is just a novelty for me. I know what it costs to make a slice of toast now! I don't think it actually caused us to change our behavior around any individual device, but it did show how some things were very expensive. I now have my PS/3 plugged into it pretty much full time so I can tell how much per month it is costing."
4,P3 Kill-a-Watt monitor,It gave a quick and easy to understand electric usage for any household appliance. Can identify appliances that have a problem or are overconsuming power or allows you to evaluate power usage on an older appliance to compare to newer Energy efficient appliances.
5,Opened my eyes!,"I purchased this to get ready for a solar project I was installing in my home.Opened my eyes to many hidden drains and surprised me at how little some things use as well. ie: 18v battery bank charger for my cordless tools uses nearly half a kilowatt a day! By the same token I was amazed a 20"" color TV only uses about 60 watts, and a 6500 btu air conditioner marked 720 watts only uses 525 on high.Worth every penny spent on it, and has already paid for it's self."
4,Really useful,"I learned a lot about the exact electrical usage of my appliances, and at what settings. For example, I learned that the power for my computer is variable based on the brightness of the monitor, and I know how much it generally uses over a month. Unfortunately, display is hard to read in the dark and in odd corners, and is only valid while plugged in. But I'd still buy it again, it's totally been worth it. At the least it answers curious questions I have, and at best, it makes me conscious and in control of my energy use."
5,Killawatt,The vender delivered very quickly and the item works as expected. I'd purchase again from this person without hesitation.
4,Serves its purpose,"This thing does what it is supposed to do, and works well. I would ignore many reviews about the quality of the product - it is not a complicated or expensive device, and is probably not meant for rigorous use. It helped me see where my wife and I were losing $ on our electric bill (carbon monoxide detectors run us $10/month!). But once it was used for all our equipment, I haven't found much use for it. Granted, it probably does much more than I recognize it can do. But with a good spreadsheet you can at least see what things in your house are power hogs, and if your ""power-saving"" features on many devices are gimmicks or gold. (One of my PC's at home is running at over 130 W; I checked a power strip at work with a few big things on it, which combined were actually using less!)"
2,does not calculate $$,"This one does not calculate cost, you have to do that yourself! The other one P4460 does. I didn't know there was a difference until I got this one as a second unit, so I returned it. The other is well worth a few more dollars more IMO."
2,Worked good....for awhile.,This product worked good for about 6 months....had it on a circulator pump so i could figure out how much it affect my electric bill....checked on it one day and the unit was dead. Would not buy this again.
5,Great product!,Love this thing! I'm a DIY guy and build like to dabble in high efficiency heat pump heating technology. It allows me to track my watts consumed and KWH used. My only gripe is it loses my data when unplugged. The newer version does not do this.
4,"Great device, fundamentally limited","It's a great device for seeing how much power something draws, but it is fundamentally limited by having to be plugged in between the source and the draw for the power. I'm not sure if it's possible to accurately measure wattage through a clip-on type of meter, however. The screen is decent, but sometimes hard to read far off-angle or in very poor light, like if I'm measuring the power of something behind an electronics cabinet."
3,basic unit ok but requires some calculations,"I bought the basic unit because I work in the energy field and wanted to know how the base unit works. It is fine, seemingly accurate and easy to connect. But it does require a bit of calculation to figure out the total usage. Plus if you plug it into the wall you then have to bend down there to read the results. If you unplug it you get a reset and all results are lost. Be a sport and upgrade to the one that does the math for you, the EZ model. I have not tried it yet but the principle seems right. Or go big time and get the power strip, then you can put it where you can read it."
2,Stopped working,"This was nice for the price, and gave me a good indication of the cost of my appliances. I would have liked it to retain a memory of the wattage by using a battery, even if the memory only lasted a few minutes because you find yourself having trouble reading the information on the device when it is in a hard to reach area.I bought this probably 3-4 months ago and now it no longer works, it cut the power off to the devices that were connected to it also. I would not mind paying a little more for a more reliable device."
1,Kill-a-Watt,This product does not come ready to use nor does it come with any detailed instructions. Save your money and buy something that comes more user friendly even you have to pay a few dollars more!
2,No instructions,"It didn't come with any meaningful instructions, and I can't figure out how to use it effectively. Too many options, and I don't know enough about electricity to figure out which one(s) to use to get the information I need."
2,Disappointed,"The design blocks both outlets. So to get a reading on say the refrigerator, I would have to also disconnect the radio or other device using the second outlet. Putting the plug at the top and the readout on the bottom would free-up the other outlet, and still provide the information I was seeking. Not practical."
3,not bad,* effective monitor* would be nice to have a reset button* difficult to monitor appliances that have low power consumption
5,Cool Item,Very cool fun to see what items in your house are power hogs. I found some things in my home that use power while not even in use. Might save you $$$$ on your electric bill.
4,fun and informative,Arrived and works as decribed. I used it to help me make a decesion to replace an appliance due to energy consumption. Knowing is half the battle.
5,power killer,I have always wanted a tool to show me how much electricty I was wasting and now I have found it!!!
5,Cost-Saving Energy Usage,"I recently purchased the Kill A Watt P4400 from Amazon. This is a great affordable tool to find out how much electricity various appliances use. This tool showed me which appliances use the most electricity in my home, so I can unplug them while they are not being used for an extended period of time. This will also allow me to ask better questions when I go and replace these appliances. As of today, January 1st, my electric rates increased by 16.6% so energy conservation is important.I would highly recommend the Kill A Watt P4400."
4,Useful Tool,"I wish I had found this before. I can now tell you how much it costs to heat my waterbed and keep my food cool in the fridge. The only drawback is that it is powered by the line, when you unplug it the memory is wiped. This means that you will want to get a good 5 or 6 foot extension cord so that you can read the meter when the outlet is behind, say, the refrigerator."
5,Cool Product,This is a great product to help you manage your energy usage. You will be surprised at how much energy appliances that are turned OFF use. You may want to start using powerstrips to manage things like entertainment systems or computers and their peripherals.
3,A nice toy,"The unit operates as advertised with displays for volts, watts, amps, and KWhr use. Others have noted lack of light on LCD screen inhibits use so have a flashlight handy. This needs to be run via an extension cord for hard to reach plugs (such as a refrigerator) so you can see the screen. It did provide some surprises as to power use usage for TV's and chargers."
3,Nice idea but...,"Kill-A-Watt is a nice idea but if you really want the info, upgrade to the unit with battery power and memory. Problem with this unit is that you usually need to plug it into the wall under a table or someplace inaccessable. It is nearly impossible to read the data in this location. And, the data computed goes away when the unit is unplugged."
1,Nice meter until it stops working,After a little over a year my meter is giving false readings. Repair cost is more than purchase price. I won't buy another one. It's not worth it.
2,Poor physical design,"This product plugs into the wall and blocks BOTH outlets, even though there is only a single outlet on front. That's stupid and poorly designed."
5,Tran,"I have Item about 1 month real good working order to my Solar panel Grid tie inverter ,,You never have any good than item with cheap price like this"
4,Does what it says it will do,I've got it testing an outlet in my home with a power strip attached to it to find the results over time. So far that TV outlet hasn't pulled near the power I thought it would. Great product...
4,useful,"This product helped me locate an appliance that was costing me $100 a month, so it paid for itself. I recommend the product, but be aware that it only works on 110 volt things that can be plugged in to it, so it does not work with the big 220 volt power users, nor does it work on many built in things."
5,Great power monitor,"Bought mine so I can make sure by backup generator is running at the right speed. I just plug it into the generator outlet, push the ""Hz"" button and adjust the governor for 61.5 Hz at no load. As the generator loads up, it runs right at 60 Hz at half load and 58.5 Hz at full load. It's also handy to see how much juice a small appliance uses."
5,Just excellent,All you can need. Just plug and start detecting were you can save energy!!!It can't be more simple!!!
4,"Easy to use, easy to save!","I live in Canada's smallest province, Prince Edward Island, but we probably have the highest electricity costs. Right now it averages between 11 and 13 1/2 cents a kilowatt-hour!! And then add the monthly service charge, etc.We need to do whatever we can to save money on our bill. I bought this little gem and right away saved way more than it costs. How?Easy- I had an old upright freezer and I thought it might need replacing. I plugged the Kill A Watt meter into the wall receptacle, and plugged the freezer into it.I took the reading and my latest electric bill and wow!!! I'm paying about $180 a year to keep my ice cream frozen!So, out it went, and I bought a new freezer (actually one size bigger). I figure it's going to cost me about 1/4 of what the old one did! That means the energy savings will pay for the new freezer in about 7 years!Thank you Kill A Watt!"
1,Cheap Electricity Usage Monitor,This item sucks. It stopped working after a few months. I don't even know how to go about returning it.don't purchase.
3,power,"the monitor does not give any reference points. I don't know just by plugging it in, as to how much energy is being used"
2,Too complicated for easy use,"Was excited to get this, but it is way too labor intensive for me for ease of use. Wrote to company, since came with no instructions. Have to leave it plugged in to appliance for some longish unexplained time, then check with local electric company bill to see how much it costs per killowatt hour. Maybe for a more obsessive person, definitely not for me."
1,Relatively useless unless you are a techy,"Sounds like a good idea, but to monitor the electricity usage of individual appliances and gadgets and keep track of the info so as to try to save a bit of energy is really too fussy to be practical. Some may find the time to do it and you may enjoy it. Good luck."
2,Dissapointed in product.,"It implies it will calculate costs per day/month/year, but, in fact, YOU must apply readings against utility rate to figure your costs. Most utilities have so many add-on costs, e.g., fuel surcharges, etc., that it is nearly impossible to really grasp the accurate cost of usage. Also, yet another product made in CHINA, that we could easily make in the USA."
4,P4400 Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor,It works as advertised.However you need a three pronged outlet to use it.
5,It works.,This thing seems to work as advertised. Very helpful to determine how many Watts to shop for when buying a new power supply for my gaming computer.
4,Good device to have. some cons though,"Overall i'd say its a nice device to have.Couple of things i didnt like was it looses all information regarding power consumption etc as soon as you unplug itwhich makes it hard if you had the device plugged in a place thats hard to reach into and read.Also the sockets very tight. Dont Know if thats cause its new, but i had to wrestle to get my plug out of the socket on it."
5,A real eye opener,"This is a simple to use device that allows you to see how you are adding all those dollars to your power bill. It works just as advertised with one possible weakness of loosing all of it's data if you unplug it or the power goes off, normally not a problem.I discovered which devices are eating up most of my power (pool pump 10kwh per day) and which are not (my HP printer eats about 6kwh per month).Nice device well worth it's price for the information it brings."
4,watts,Thus far I have approved of the service of this item. It has preformed as I expected. It provides the information I needed.
3,ok for a power monitor,"Being employed in power quality for the past 20 years, I know a bit about power monitors. This is a nice cheap device to provide you with your energy consumption. It will also provide you with fairly accurate costs.It will not provide you with troubleshooting information, such as harmonic, or inter harmonic content. Flicker, or waveforms.So, if you want to reduce energy costs, this can help you identify devices actual energy cost. If you wish to troubleshoot an electrical problem, you should look elsewhere. A good start would be the Ranger PQ Recorders [...]"
3,"Works well and simple design, but too big","As indicated in the title, this product works well. However, due to its size, it covers up both outlets, so you have to use attach it to an extension cord in order to use the other outlet."
4,Like it but some issues,"The unit is inexpensive and useful. I'd give it 5 stars except: 1) loses data (KWH and hours) when power is lost, 2) bulky - should come with a short cord to make it easy to use and handle. I'm looking into the P4460 which does not lose data when power is lost."
4,money saver,This item was very useful in learning that items not geing used are also drawing power and costing me money.
5,These are great,I've used these to decide how to save energy with other devices like kill switches and smart strips. It works great and shows a lot of information. I also use it with my solar energy setup to show how much energy my solar panels are generating. Works great.
4,nice tool,"nice gadget if you are concern with your power consumptions or just curious how much your appliances consume power. Just check the power rating to avoid mismatch. I used it on our LCD TV. Im amazed that LCD TV consumption depends greatly on the backlight settings, not on the brightness or color settings. I was able to determine that our 42in TV consume 60W to approx 140W depending on the backlight adjustment when in use.I should have bought a higher rating monitor so i can check bigger ratings appliances like portable heaters, induction cookers, etc."
1,Dead on arrival,"The product I received was dead on arrival.. nothing displayed on the LCD screen (although the plugged in appliance did work). This was probably just a lemon, but product support was very unhelpful in resolving this issue - my emails and phone messages were never returned, so my faith in the company is not particularly high at the moment."
2,Badly Needs Two Improvements,"I agree with many of the other reviewers. The electrical prongs need to be moved closer to the edge of the unit so it doesn't block the second outlet of the wall plug. The Kill A Watt also needs a backlight. It's virtually impossible to see if the units are Watt or VA (both operated by the same function button) without getting down on the floor with a flashlight. The device does provide the data it advertises, but it's very hard to read the values and know what function is being displayed."
5,Does what I wanted it to.,"We just put a sump pump in a few months ago, and we can't tell if it's coming on. I plug the sump pump into this gizmo, which plugs into the outlet and it tells me how many cumulative watts the device has used. If it was more expensive, I probably wouldn't have gotten it, but the price is right for a handy little device."
3,"Works, but blocks the 2nd plug on any outlet, and is not backlit","This is a very useful item with a couple of design flaws. First, for no apparent reason, the plug on the back of the unit is set too far from the bottom of the case, so if you plug it into a standard 2-outlet household jack, it blocks the other one. Second, also for no apparent reason, the LCD is not backlit, so get used to pointing a flashlight at this thing if it's under a desk, or crawling under there to read it.My usage pattern was to plug it in (and re-plug everything that used to be in the 2nd socket of that outlet) and write down wattage readings, for each combination of whatever was plugged in. Laptop, display, printer, hair dryer, etc. So that means lots of flashlight-assisted reading.Aside from those annoyances it works fine and I'm glad I got it."
3,Good until it broke,Was great for keeping track of my aquariums power consumption until the screen got all screwed up and just shows gibberish now.
1,Three failures in a year.,"I am on my third one in a year, and it just died.Too bad. A little quality control would make it a useful product."
4,"Good but low-wattage ""blind spot""","If you are trying to monitor energy usage for appliances and other higher wattage devices the P4400 will give you a good idea of your usage. I was able to determine that my freezer was accounting for 30% of the electric bill, for instance.I cannot attest to the ""0.2 percent"" accuracy they claim, but this device has a little ""blind spot"" at the low end. For many people this isn't a big deal, but when you are trying to gather multi-day information on low-wattage devices (especially in ""standby"" mode) this will not work very well. Frequently low-wattage devices that draw low single digits will show as either 0 or 1 watts, even over hours or days of use."
4,P3 Electric Monitor,"I found the P3 functionally very nice and helpful. The display was very difficult to read because it was not bright enough and the letters after the number(ie,VA & watts)were extremely hard to make out. Having the unit backlit and larger letter would have been preferred.WT"
3,"Simple, and works","Does what it says it does, however it has two design faults that make using it more cumbersome than it needs to:1. The plug is backwards such that when you add this to an outlet it covers the 2nd outlet.2. The numbers that are calculated are only displayed when the device is plugged in which can make it a pain to read in some applications."
4,Great tool within limits,"The concept is great, very interesting to find out what specific appliances use what electricity. For that it's very useful and as far as I can tell, works great. However- it does not have a battery or capacitor to hold onto the data that it has been collecting for you after it is unplugged. This is a problem when you can't read it where it is. It also occupies both recepticals of a given outlet- another issue that comes up occasionally. Both of these annoyances can be handled with a bit of forethought and a powerstrip, so not huge, just annoying."
4,Great product for the money,"Amazing gadget for the price. It's quite simple to use and gives exactly the info you need. That being current power consumption and power consumption over time.As many people noted, the major negative is that it doesn't have a cord. That is easily solved with a power strip. Actually, I'd prefer it this way because I wouldn't want to pay the added cost for P3 to include it in every unit."
5,Top quality projector screen with more features than you would expect,"The Picture King is built like a tank and at 70in size it weighs around 45lb and can be quite heavy for some people, but I prefer the heft and sturdy construction that leads to its overall weight. You don't mind banging around door jambs and in and out of the car because you know it can take it.I was surprised by how smoothly it operates. Most adjustments can be made with one hand. There was no sag or defects in the screen. If you need a professional presentation screen, I highly recommend this one.In a fully lit board room it provided an excellent image from my BenQ short-throw projector. Slides, graphs, excel tables, and photos were all shown and everyone in the room could easily see everything. I suspect at this size it could accommodate presentations in rooms as large as a small auditorium (100 ~ 200 seats) depending on the content and font size used in the slides."
3,"The infamous siege 'revealed', well, sort of...","It seemed that the ashes of the fire that claimed the lives of David Koresh and his followers had not even cooled when this book about the Branch Davidians, their Living Prophet Koresh, and the tense siege with law enforcement officers appeared on bookshelves at drug stores and supermarkets everywhere. Because of this, Clifford Linedecker's narrative clearly favors the law enforcement side of the tragic events and what inside information into the compound life seems to come from former members with understandly negative opinions about their experience at the compound. Linedecker does relate the fascinating history of the Seventh-Day Adventist splinter group and their long line of Living Prophets, for this the book might prove interesting to True Crime fans, but many of the facts and the characterization of life in the compound has, over time, come into question."
1,No Factual Value,"I have done a lot of research and writing about Waco in both college and graduate school. I think anyone who studies the tragedy with any depth will easily recognize that this book is junk. It was written very soon after the events took place, much too soon for any real research to have been done by the author. Linedecker gives a highly spectacularized version of the events that I believe were intended to sell to an essentially uneducated, sex-and-violence addicted audience. Read Dick Reavis' ""The Ashes of Waco"" if you are looking for a reliable factual account of the Waco tragedy."
2,Not as good as their first or third albums,Calvin and Doug are at it again. This time it sounds like the album was put out to quelch the fire for another Halo Benders' album. The songs don't fit together as well and the music is all over the boards. With that said it is still Calvin and Doug and there are a few great songs on this album.
5,great service!,"I can't find this cd anywhere in stores luckily when I ordered it, it came in less than a week and in great condition!"
5,Funny And Educational,"I loved the clip with the guy from New York explaining the sites and sounds of San Francisco to the tourists. It was hysterical. Beyond that, it was cool to see the major tourist attractions in the city. The Golden Gate bridge is beautiful.It' sinterseting to see clips that are much more an example of amature footage than of pre-processed travel advertisments and the older quality of the clips makes them seem more real to me."
4,"Great scene from a great episode, Nice frame, But too saturated.",Bought this as I am a huge Charmed fan. The frame and size and overall poster is nice. But be warned because the actual product is oversaturated and a bit too warm in tones. I know that Rose McGowan has super pale skin but she looks yellowish. And if you watch the show {especially in the earlier seasons} then you know Phoebe tanned alot. But she looks down right orange in the poster which sucks.
2,reluctant biographical subject,"The book seems to be a strung together set of anecdotes and information gathered from articles etc already in the public domain with Maychick filling in the blanks with her own conclusions. It does not come across as a biography that had the support or co-operation of the subject herself. Nevertheless it does convey almost a claustrophobic existence for an actress coming to terms with the fame and loss of privacy that her talent had generated and I finished the book feeling very sad for this lady. Twenty plus years on its wonderful to see this woman so much more at ease with her status of superstar. The book reminds us that the early days were not easy ones for Meryl Streep personally or professionally despite her prodigious talent, something that is often glossed over these days."
1,Cobblers,"I read this book and this account is not a review. The author appears to invent certain details. One example of many is the claim that during filming of the FLW, the cast and crew stayed at the Doll-House Inn, Lyme Regis which does not exist (I lived in Lyme Regis). If you're looking for facts, to gain new information or to enhance understanding, this book will not provide; A pretty, escapist experience however."
5,Sharp LCD is the BEST! So much better than Plasma!,"I waited several years to finally make my flat panel TV purchase and I am so glad I waited for a 37"" LCD over a 42"" Plasma! As mentioned by others, the LCD generates less heat, uses less power, has a sharper picture, and is not susceptable to ""burn-in"" on the screen. 37"" is perfect for the size of our living room.My only concern is that I notice that when switching from HDTV to normal TV, the picture on rare occasion goes very dark. (...)"
1,Dead Pixels Beware,"I bought the unit. I had exchange for three times and dead pixelsoccur in the same area of the screen. Now they are refusing to exchange it and giving you a crap of within specs. Very defectiveproduct. If you bought one look closely to your screen. I advise not to buy it. The cost is too much to give a ""within specifications"" crap of dead pixels."
4,The lost art of the muscleman movie,"It's a shame really. They no longer produce the musclemen movies.Back in the day movie theatres were packed watching Samson,Hercules.Eursus,Atlas,Goliath and the Son of Hurcules. And if there is a better movie than the original Jason and the Argonauts starring Todd Armstrong write me. And you know the best part? You can let your children watch them without fear.Or your grandkids. Nothing objectionable. Just entertainment."
4,"Very Good, but with some bad sides as well...","OK, this cd is, like the title says, both good and bad. With this being my fist portable cd player, it works well. I usually take it out on my boat, and it work pretty well, i just slip it in my pocket and try to hear it over the motor. Bass boost is comparable, and with 2 levels, you can tone it down a bit if you can't hear anything else. I haven't really tried the program, shuffle and like 4 other modes this thing has, so I can't say anything about that. Battery usage: Very good if you're just sitting in the car in aren't moving around a lot, but the batteries get pretty worn down when you spend an hour mowing grass. As for skippage, you just gotta know how to pick it up, how to compensate for hard waves, how position it, things like that. But you can get used to it after awhile. All in all, it's a great cd player at a great price."
2,It was not that good,This CD player is good and bad. The bad first. It has like no shock protection so if u lift it up it will skip. The battery indicator only comes on when the battery is dead. Now the good. It is returnable. Has good headphones. Very good Quality. very good bass boost.
4,pretty good cd player,This cd player has very good clear sound with a great bass boost.And since i am a first time buyer i find that it is very easy to use . The only problem with it is that it does skip alot but with the great price you can't expect to much.
2,It's aweful!,"This cd player plays music well, if you sit and don't move. It skips with every move you make. 2 Levels of bass boost.. kind of interesting, but if you are walking on the road and step too heavily, well, the music skips even for that. The color is really pretty (that's why i gave it 2 stars instead of 1), but be remeinded that the blue or red or whatever color that encompasses the little section on the top is easily scratch off... you'll see it after a little while and have no idea where the color went.For the money that you'll spend on this personal cd player, you can get a much better one for the same price, or add $10 more and get one that really works well."
2,Don't buy this cd player,"I have had my cd player for less than a year, and I have go buy another one becuase this one doesn't work any more. I the skip protection is horrible, the battery usage is horrible, and now I have trouble using the headphone jack. No matter what type of head phones I use, it does not play right. Don't waste your money on this cd player."
2,Is it ethical?,"Dominique is a vocalist and music teacher. After having read her quote in the New York Times, putting down an up and coming young musician, I would find it difficult to enjoy her album. It seems to me that she is a very unethical music teacher."
2,What a difficult review to write...,"Since getting my hands on the Equinox Album as a child in the 70's I've been hooked on Jean Michel Jarre and pretty much have everything he's ever recorded before and after Oxygene. That's why I was extremely surprised to hear that the minimal sounding Les Grange Brulees album being re-released. The original album is rarer than hen's teeth and worth a lot of money to Jarre collectors. But after hearing the album, you have to ask yourself why. The painful truth is that there isn't a lot to shout about Jarre's work prior to Oxygene. This album is a stepping stone to the Jarre we know and love. There are some themes in there that are reused in later works and as such, I can see this album only being found interesting by absolute die-hard Jarre fans or possibly academics interested in early electronic music. It's no Oxygene or Equinox."
3,very early Jarre,"Strongly recommended for all Jarre fans and / or early synth music lovers. Otherwise you will be deeply disappointed.Tracks on this album are sometimes comic, sometimes naive, nothing to be compared with next album Oxygene, it's completely different music. Though it shows the development of Jarre's musical ideas."
5,This album kicks,"Okay i know all off you ""TRUE"" PUNKS don't like this album I have to say this album is amazing. These guys are ground breaking. They have a great messege. While there lyrics are a little hard to understand. Well that is because of his voice. This album is down right amazing everything about it is to good to be true. All of you true punks get a life and get a ANTI-FLAG CD. you might be to diy but this is where it is at."
5,A modern classic.,"This is an incredible album, even better than Die For the Government. Anti-Flag has an amazing style, very remanicant of classic punk style. Great lyrics, great music, a great album. If you like punk rock you should really get this album. It's one of the best of the 1990s."
4,great one,"This album is certainly the best by Anti-Flag. However, it doesn't do justice to their concerts. Often the song gets lost in the message."
1,Anti-flag is horrible.,"This is as bad as punk rock gets. I hope. Thoughtless lyrics, poor musicianship... it's great to have politics, but that can't be all there is.Save your money, kids.Buy a Conflict album. Buy a DK album. Buy a Clash album.This album is for punk rock... exactly what John Tesh is for classical composition, or Mariah Carey for intelligent lyrics."
2,Making Things Worse,"All I have to say is that if you spend all your time complaining about the problems, then you'll never find any solutions. Anti-Flag apparently doesn't realize this. Every song I hear by them is pointing out problems in the government, or stating the obivous ('War is bad'). I'd just like to point out that most people won't listen to you if you cater to an audience that is desperate for a 'hardcore' band after listening to Blink 182, you whine about everything, and you sound like you haven't been through puberty. Thank you."
1,"Between 1 and 10, what IQ does the guy below me have?","Seriously, what is that guy below me on about? How is putting out a cd whining about bad things (which is all anti-flag have to offer) going to change things for the better? You act like these cd's are going to start a revolution - even though the majority of people havent even heard of them. Just because you can get a measly record contract to tell everyone why racism and war are bad doesnt mean your going to put an end to them. Grow up, and buy a DK album."
1,"These guys are walking, talking stereotypes.","This band is a good example of why people with an IQ of 80 shouldn't try to write politically-oriented lyrics. This band has no opinions of its own... everything they say , supposedly believe in, or do is a calculated attempt to abide by the Punk Rock 101 guidebook. I have a theory that these guys, Total Chaos, and Blanks 77 are all part of a right-wing conspiracy to make leftist punks look stupid."
1,Preachin' to the ignorant PC idiots!,"Punk used to be about pissing every off, but these so-called ""rebels"" take the music into preachy Rage against the machine territory. Both of these bands have the same gimmick: feed the ignorant an anti (but not to anti,read the caption on the cd cover) american message. Don't waste your money on this."
5,what a great album,"i ahd heard mixed reviews of anti-flags new album lacking the same style as die for your goverment but when i finally heard it i was blown away.they have done it again.this album is NOT a let down from their last.it has alot more melody to it,more than the last and it mixes well with their lyrics."
5,"Billy-Bob, no","Billy-bob, you dont listen. This cd is NOT antiamerica. i mean, read the darn liner notes kiddo.....and they arent british, they are from philly. Ok, with the bashing aside, this CD is possibly the best, most politically correct (not used in the way the US uses it) album ive ever heard. The music is great, its fast, the drums are phenomenale, the vocals are just amazing, and the songs are funny, witty, moving, and sometimes left me speechless. Trust me, this is the best CD ive ever bought."
4,Anti-Flag,"Anti-flag are a typical example of political punk. Their use of brassy guitars, heavy bass, mental drum rhythm and protesting lyrics make it perfect for the punks that are angry how their govenment works. This is mixed with the fustration of hearing that punk is dead and the raising population of emo's. If you like punk, this is purfect for you! if you like indie, hard-line, metal or emo music... I would stay away."
1,Horrible,I would rather listen to Michelle Branch than this garbage. These American haters need a life. And not all cops are how they say they are. There are good cops too but these @$$holes never noticed cause they are losers with cool hair!!!
4,good but not great,"this cd was pretty good, but not what i had expected. when people say this is hardcore punk thats not true. minor threat is hardcore not this. for 90s punk thought this is very good. i really liked the first three songs and free nation but other than that its just average. if i could have given this cd 3 1/2 STARS i would have, but i decided to round up. so if your an anti-flag fan get this and if you like alot of 90s punk like pennywise and afi listen to this, but if you like old stuff like dead kennedys you might not like this."
3,it's not old wave design as in the picture,"it's good product durable and very useful , but the picture is WRONG , the picture for old wave design and what they'll send is the new wave design , just wanted to make it clear for other customers .more than that the service was nice and the price is higher than other shops .thanks"
5,Lives in my truck,"I rarely have the need for multi-tool on my belt, but it seems like I always need one when I'm out somewhere, so I bought the Wave to keep in my truck. Like most multi-tools users, I probably use a knife blade and pliers for 99% of my use, but the other sure come in handy when you need them. I bought the Wave because of the needle nose pliers - which I find most useful if I'm going to have a single type - and a reasonable selection of other basic tools. Several years later, I'm still 100% happy with this tool. It's extremely well-built of heavy stainless, the knife blades hold an edge, and the pliers are usable with a good amount of squeeze without deforming. Very solid, and fold up compact in its case in the glove box. I keep my eye on newer versions of multi-tools as they come out and have yet to see one that I would replace the Wave for."
3,Gettin' Jiggy Wit Ziggy,"First of all, a tribute to Benny without a clarinet player is like the Brat Pack without Sammy. But that said, if you're a fan of big band trumpet legend Ziggy Elman this disc is for you. If not there's not much here that's interesting or new. Recorded in the 50's, pianist Stacy has assembled a crew of good swingmen to blow on some big band standards made famous by the King of Swing. Elman easily outshines everyone on this pretty average performance. Not highly recommended but not a complete dud...some decent toe-tapping swing that will make you think of Benny but probably make you yearn for the real thing versus more from this ensemble.Oh yeah, the girl on the cover is cute."
2,"It's a good player, but don't drop it!","After my crummy Sony Discman broke two years ago, I tried this Panasonic model. Let me tell you, it has good bass, the batteries don't suck up that much power, ESP is long and it's pretty compact and lightweight. Looks good too with the silver. However, if you are a little rough with it, it might not play another day. I dropped this puppy several times in the first two months. After one big drop exiting my dorm, it could never play again since the plasic hinge broke off, thus making the CD door harder to close. I couldn't play it anymore! I gave it two stars because of it's lack of durrability. It's a great player, but be VERY careful with it!"
4,Nice CD Player,"This CD Player is a good one it is small relative to many others it sounds good, but I use good headphones. It never skips and for the price I am happy with it. It takes CD-Rs It has all the fuctions you would want in a CD Player (Random, Program, repeat, ect...)it looks good. You can always buy bigger more expensive CD players but for the price of this one you got what you paid for, and a little more. A good deal for the price."
2,Started to make a high pitched noise after a few months,"When I first got this, it was everything that I wanted from it. It didn't skip in the car, it sounded fine. Of course it came with crappy headphones, but thats normal. But the reason I gave it 2 stars, was because after a few months when playing music i will hear high pitched sound in the backround. I can still listen to music, but it be much nicer without it. So I do not recommend this product."
2,More of an inconvenience than a convenience,"This is my own fault. I've been too busy to take my car in to have a CD changer installed in the trunk. So instead I bought this portable CD player. With the car kit's tape inserted in the cassette player of my car, the volume must be cranked to get a decent level and sometimes it distorts. Worse, it's really hard to open and insert CD's while driving. The mechanism to open it must be slid while keeping your hands from blocking the opening of the lid. A near impossibility to do with one hand while watching the road. It has a spindle inside to press the disc on (sopposedly to enhance the anti-skip function). Try doing this while driving! I'd rather prolong my life. I'll take my car in for the installation of a CD changer and return this portable player to Amazon instead."
1,INCOMPATIBLE WITH FORD VEHICLES,"FORGET ABOUT USING THE CASSETTE ADAPTER WITH A FORD VEHICLE, I TRIED MANY TIMES INSERTING THE ADAPTER INTO THE PLAYER BUT IT KEPT EJECTING WITH AN ERROR CODE OF ONE. I CALLED PANASONIC AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD NOT OPERATE PROPERLY AND I SHOULD BUY A CASSETTE ADAPTER FROM RADIO SHACK. THIS I DID ONLY TO FIND THAT THE UNITS EARPHONE JACK DOES NOT MAKE A PROPER CONNECTION. P.S. DON'T DO WHAT I DID OR IT COULD DAMAGE YOUR CARS CASSETTE PLAYER.IT LEFT MINE WITH ALMOST NO AUDIO OUTPUT ON THE LEFT CHANNEL."
1,nice sound but.......,This CD player was great for the 3 months I had it. It was great never skipped at all NEVER skipped once. But when i dropped it on a hard-wood floor from 1foot up it shattered into a million pieces. It might have just been an awkward position but if it broke from a standstill then it is guarrenteed to break from a drop while jogging.So basically if you plan to use it in a car or another safe position go for it
1,pathetic,This is the biggest wast of money. It takes forever to change songs. Alot of times it stops half way through a song. i strongly advise not to buy it. The tape and headphones eaven broke within the first 6 months. never drop it
4,Nice for the price,"I chose did product with my faith in panasonic. I did not use a lot of portable CD players so I cannot think of the comparison with other brands. I like this CD play because of the fact that1) it is slim, sleek design, very light.2) 24+hours playing with 2 AA alkaline batteries wow! I alway admire panasonic in this feature (most of panasonic product use very little energy). Adapter is also included.3) Good anti-skip, in fact I never notice the skiping during shaking.Sound is ok, heavy X bass. I used it with my computer speakers/sub. quite nice, but it need a little more volume. Nice for use with the head phone."
5,Excellent portable CD player for the car...,"I was amazed by the fact that this machine has never skipped, even on really bumpy roads! The sound quality is quite good with its built in xtra bass functionality. The main buttons are placed directly on top and in the middle of the machine making it easy to see them in your peripheral vision while driving. For the price, I couldn't find a better portable CD player for my car."
3,"Sometimes you can love it, some times you beat it up","This is good sometimes only. We've got many of these. It's just ordinary. Same sound, same features, nothing new.For some reason I love listening to it on the CDs. I have no reason for any of this. It really depends on how picky you are rather than anything else."
5,I have flip-flopped -- it IS incredible!,"At first, I didn't like this score very much. In fact, my original review was titled ""Not So Incredible"" and I only gave it two stars. Well, I've listened to the cd a little more and I've seen the movie (several times). And, basically, I think I'm in danger of wearing out the cd!I think Giacchino has crafted a magnificent score here and I just keep playing it and playing it.Needless to say, I have deleted my original, 2 star review and I've upgraded it to 5 stars."
4,"Dare I say ""Incredible"" soundtrack? (groan)","Love this sound track. So much great classic/spy/action music. Very diverse sounds from the 60's-ish spy era. Unfortunately, the soundtrack does start to blur & get more dull after about the first 8 or 9 tracks."
5,Incredibly Nice,"I just have to say I love this soundtrack. As a musician I value fun enjoyable music as a way to relax, movie soundtracks being a favorite. The composer matched the fun, ""we can do anything"", feel of the movie. I particulary enjoyed the part where dash is running on water for the first time, the music perfectly matched the thrill expressed on his face. This wonderful use of music to express the emotions of the characters was prevelent throughout the film. What can I say, I'm a sucker for this movie and it's soundtrack...."
4,"Great Score, but....","Why does the name ""John Barry"" keep popping up in reviews of Michael Giacchino's score for the most excellent Pixar movie, ""The Incredibles""? Mainly because, aside from Lalo Schifrin's TV-themes (e.g., ""Mission Impossible""), this score was lifted -- almost note for note -- from John Barry's Connery-era James Bond movie soundtracks, in particular, ""Goldfinger.""Do not get me wrong: The music *works* and works wonderfully with the onscreen action. However, the reason it works is primarily due to the compositional prowess of John Barry, whose name -- by all rights -- should be right up there on ending credits as ""Music Composed by"" along with Lalo Schifrin.Michael Giacchino's onscreen titles should be ""Music Arranged by"" and ""Additional Music By."""
3,"It's gonna be ""Incredible"" if someone doesn't get sued here","O.K., so I read the liner notes, and I know that the Pixar people and their composer were deliberately going after that late '60's pop/jazz feel of those campy spy and adventure films of the decade. Can't blame 'em; good choice of musical style for this type of film. The film is great fun; the music is a great spoofy homage to the films of an earlier era. But, oh my gosh! Play John Barry's score to Goldfinger, particularly ""Arrival of the bomb and countdown"" and ""Kobe dock"" from ""You Only Live Twice"". Someone Giacchino owes just a little too much to John Barry, and I can't help wondering if Giacchino and Pixar are really going to owe something to John Barry before this is all over. If not, somebody's lawyers aren't paying a great deal of attention. Great score, but I'm a high school English teacher always on the lookout for plagiarism in my students' papers. How can give this one five stars when it isn't all Giacchino's work?"
4,Experimental and Melodic OMD,"This album shows how OMD took the influence of Kraftwerk and was able to mold it with their own style and the result is a quirky solid collection of songs. Besides the recognizable ""Electricity"" and ""Messages"", there are solid songs such as ""Bunker Soldiers"", ""Almost"", ""Pretending to See the Future"" and maybe one of the best OMD songs ever ""The Messerschmidt Twins"". The only negative to the album is that it doesn't sound as well-produced as other OMD albums; however, there is a certain charm from the lack of production."
3,Well...it's a start,"Definately not OMD's best album or even close, but it was their first one. I was really interested to hear what it sounded like so that's why I got it. The whole thing sounds very light, all the melodies are quite simple compared to the popular OMD singles we all know. When you have filler songs like ""Julia's Song"" and ""Dancing"" it brings the album down a little. A surprise I did like was the album version of ""Messages"" with a slower tempo and different synth, but still the same effect. ""The Messerchmitt Twins"" is beautiful, and only a preview of the slow tempo ballads McCluskey & Humphreys were going to soon bring out. Though not something you'll likely listen to much, I recommend it anyway."
4,Great debut!,"Looking back now on OMD's history, is good knowing that this firtst release by Liverpool's electronic duo has aged very well.Back in the 80's ""Messages"" did so well, and still does. This new re-release that includes extra tracks is the best you can get, even better that the original back in 1980. If you are a true OMD fan, this is a must, even thought you may alredy have the b-sides from the ""Navigation"" CD, this is a good chance to get your hands on this CD and listen to this excellent extra version of ""Almost"" or ""Messages"" don't miss it!"
4,Good Source of Sugar Process Engineering Information,"This book is, in many ways, a good companion volume to the other standard text in sugar cane engineering (Hugot, Handbook of Cane Sugar Engineering). Chen and Chou's book is oriented to the sugar processing aspect of sugar manufacture. The book is more about how to make sugar than how to make machines that make sugar.The Cane Sugar Handbook covers raw sugar manufacture, refining, process controls, and analytical procedures.The text is illustrated well with many line drawings, charts and graphs, and a few black and white photographs.There are many useful data tables in the appendix. The text is fully referenced to papers and articles .All in all a useful reference work to keep in your desk's top drawer (right next to Hugot)."
5,"Sensational, lush, and yet bare, proving less is truly more.","This is the first album this year that has instantly blown me away. It features the classic sparse trio (piano, bass, and drums) and the thin-ish vocals of Lisa Ekdahl which were a common source of criticism about her previous album, When Did You Leave Heaven. Here her vocals remain thin but she's matured, the depth of her expression carries her through. Combined with the often eclectic variations of the Peter Nordahl Trio this album of mostly standards is familiar and suprising at the same time. A real listening treat."
3,A singer with a babyish voice,"Miss Ekdahl is outstanding in a number of ways. However, she has a voice that is more babyish than Blossom Dearie, April Barrows or Bernadette Peters. You may want to listen to one tune all the way through to be sure you don't find it irritating."
3,So small! Almost perfect...,"This is the smallest usb drive I've seen to date. Wonderfully small. It has a pretty fast transfer speed, and works well. The only flaw is the plastic they chose to make it with. OCZ used a very hard and brittle plastic that quickly started showing little chips and scratches. After a week of toting it around, the little plastic nub for hooking to your key chain, etc. broke. I feared this would happen given the brittle plastic. So now I have no easy way to tote it around... and it is so small, you could easily lose it. If OCZ remade this without any plastic, and used some brushed metal instead... this would be the perfect usb drive for taking everywhere... as it is, I can only give it 3 stars. :-("
1,Small. Unfortunately.....,"I keep my USB stick in my pocket, attached to my keychain. Therefore, only the smallest models come into consideration. I thought I had found the perfect one with the OCZ Roadster. Unfortunately, the small plastic ring broke after less than one week of use. That's a real pity, because otherwise the device is nice. Just because of this small, badly designed detail, the whole thing is now useless."
1,It could been the finest product of it's kind!,"The selling point of this product is that it's small and it can be carried in a key chain. If one will do so, the loop will brake (mine did broke in a month and I lost it). I consider this product as a failure! Next time try to change that loop, other then it will, can, be the finest product of its kind."
4,FULCI-BEATS!,"Funky, Fulci-inspired beats related to his ""Zombie"" film from the 70s. Pretty collectable on vinyl I imagine, but who wants to hassle with a record player now days. Buy the CD instead. Overall, very interesting."
3,Funki Porcini - Zombie & The Jerry Van Rooyen Remixes,"Funki Porcini pays homage to Lucio Fulci with these two tracks, inspired by Fulci's gut-munching zombie movies. ""Flesheater Boulevard"" is appropriately cinematic and it shuffles about like its undead namesake, with some bongo drums thrown in at the end for good measure. ""Fulci on the Rocks"" has much more of a bass about it. The other three tracks are mixes of Jerry Van Rooyen tracks, and all three still have a similar cinematic feel, even if they're not particularly horrific. Indeed, ""Great Train Robbery"" plays pretty straight, featuring Van Rooyen's funky trumpet front and center. ""Tunnel Hunter"" mixes together energy (with its rollicking rhythm) and dreaminess (the more ambient interlude). An interesting side dish, if not that main course."
4,Just what I wanted,This camera is just right for occasional use. I enjoy finaly having an easy to use digital camera with easy download capabilities and fun to use.
2,Disappointment,"I owned a power shot A65 and LOVED it. Easy to use, great pix. When it finally gave out I researched cameras and this model kept coming up as a best buy. I was extremely disappointed with it--the lcd screen is extremely fuzzy. I went to a store to see if maybe I had just gotten a bad camera but the instore model was just as bad. I printed a couple of pictures, thinking the screen may not impact the pictures. The pictures were grainy and fuzzy also. I returned the camera and bought a different model."
4,Great budget camera!,"I bought this camera for my daughter. She loves it. It has some neat features such as scene settings to use at the beach, fireworks, aquarium etc. It is a feature packed camera that a kid can manage and it was a great price too! Thanks Amazon."
4,CANON A560,"Nice camera for the price. Light and semi-compact. Takes great pics.Only one complaint, the battery life is pretty short. This camera uses 2 AA batteries as opposed to my last Canon that used 4AA."
4,I like this camera,"I bought 2 of these cameras last Christmas (2007), one for me and one as a gift.There have been no problems with either camera and its been a year.I have taken some nice pictures with the macro setting of shrimp and fish in my aquariums. On the normal indoor setting it has taken good pictures time after time. The video feature works well and the sound is good.My only beef with the camera is that it shipped with one tiny card that would only hold 2 pictures. As cheap as cards are they could pack one that could hold more pictures than that."
4,Canon,"Nice camera, easy to use, takes good pictures.Canon PowerShot A560 7.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom"
4,A great delicate camera,"I love Canon cameras. This is the third Canon digital that I've purchased (S40, SD20 previously). It works great right out the box--nice pics, syncs with Mac no problem at all. It is a little big compared to many cameras out there. My only issue is that I damaged the iris that protects the lens with a fairly small trauma. I wouldn't change my decision based on this, but if you're tough on cameras (dropper or pockets) buy a case."
4,Smart purchase,"Nice size camera equipped with tons of features, the optical zoom is really great. The accompanying disk is easy to install and printing is as easy as pie. This was definitely a good purchase for me and I highly recommend this product."
1,Awful interior low light pictures,I have had this camera for about 16 months. The auto focus seems to have broken. It will not focus when I zoom. The low light ability has always been poor. I wouldn't suggest buying this for taking any indoor pictures.
5,I love this camera!,"The Canon PowerShot A560 is a great camera for beginners. It is easy to use and it is very good quality. The graphics are great and it takes the picture quickly. It has a wonderful face identification feature which makes the picture even better than it was before. After you take the picture you can also do a red eye correction, i mean, who wants red eyes?! I love this camera!"
4,Nice Canon!!!!,I received my canon a560 on time had it only about a month takes great pic a little bigger than most point and shoot digital camera. But I am able to handle very well not as big as i thought. Would give it 5 stars if it had picture stabilizer.
4,Canon PowerShot A560 7.1MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom,Love this camera. Its easy to use. Directions are simple. Has many features and picture quality is very good.
4,Great Product,"I was worried to buy a Canon and at a price that was cheaper than its Nikon counterpart, but its great. It does not suck battery power (I'm still using the set it came with 3weeks later), in review mode, if you move the camera the picture adjusts and moves too!! Overall, it was a great buy I think."
4,decent device for its price,"It's a good deal overall. I doubt you'll find a better quality camera for this price. Still I will consider buying some more expensive equipment next time.Pros:Easy to useHuge LCD screenBattery life is okCons:Sharpness. Prepare to get quite a few blurry shots, especially when shooting inside. This cam has to be totally steady if you care for sharpness.Brightness - flash light could be more powerful if you don't want to adjust brightness/contrast in Photoshop after shooting close-ups inside.Colors - could be more vivid at the auto mode."
5,"Great camera, great price","The Canon Powershot A560 was half the price of my three year old Canon Powershot A75 and has 4x zoom vs 3x zoom, 7.1 megapixels vs 3.2; it's smaller, but has a larger LCD screen, takes 2 AA cells rather than 4 and takes more pics with 2 than the A75. It's also lighter. The price (under $130)is great for the quality of camera. Buy one for your kids, for your mother, for yourself."
2,For once canon camera not upto expectation ...,"I got this a couple of days back and have clicked a few snaps both indoor & outdoors ... close up, normal and max zoom.The shape and feel is same as most of the A series cameras. Surprisingly it felt lightweight with batteries & SD card.The colors come out good as canon pics always do. Some of the pics under the sun came out overexposed (auto mode) which came as a surprise to me.The greatest dissappointment is the time it takes after a snap is taken to process the pic and store it (considering its a Digic III processor). Mind you, I use a standard Sandisk 1GB SD Card. It takes a while for the flash to get re-charged. Also, I found the battery performance dissappointing."
1,Absolute garbage,"This runs on double A batteries. Even with new batteries, after a couple of pictures, it stops working and I need to let it rest before using again for a couple of shots. I have a friend who has the same camera and has had the same issue."
4,Great camera,This is a great little camera. I had a similiar older model which met its demise when I fell into a river with it in my pocket. Its great for skiing pictures because it fits in your pocket and you can take a picture with one hand without having to fiddle with lens covers.
1,Canon A560 - MAJOR battery issues,"The 560 worked great through the first set of batteries. Then, the problems started. New batteries would only work for a short time, and then the low battery light would come on. I tried various brands, including rechargeable batteries, but the problem persisted. Finally, I searched online and found MANY other people with this series having the same problem. Buyer beware! You may not have this problem, but there are a lot of us out there that are stuck with an expensive paperweight."
5,Great camera for the price,A great little camera. With lots of features. Can't beat it for the price.
4,we really like this camera,"So far we have really enjoyed our new Canon Powershot. The pictures look great and printing is really easy. We were able to give lots of homemade gifts this year with really great photos from our camera. We are moving to China soon and will be taking a lot of pictures there, so I can only hope that the camera continues to operate perfectly and let us continue to be picture people for really the first time in our lives."
4,Nice camera but you need a tripod if you plan to take pictures in low light environments.,"This camera produces good quality pictures *if* there is enough light present. Even when it has an ISO adjustment, trying to take pictures in a low light situation will produce a blurry picture if you don use a tripod. I guess that happens because the camera needs a higher exposure time when there is not enough light, making the camera more susceptible to vibrations which in the end will blurry the final image. In the other hand, pictures taken under good light are very well focused and with no discernable pixelation.The advantage of this camera is that it has a Program mode, in which you can control most of the parameters of the camera manually. This is good if you like to experiment, because you can obtain superb results this way.In any case, if you plan to do a lot of pictures outside at night, you must use this camera with a tripod."
4,NOT BAD!,"After losing my samsung, which I found to take extremely good pics and was no longer sold, I decided on this one and must say that for the price I paid for it, it takes very good pics. However, I do recall purchasing it for much less. It disappointed me on a few occassions, however later found that you must learn to use the settings to get great pics. I have been told several times that I take quality shots especially at family engagements."
4,Better the second time around,"I bought this camera as a gift for my daughter. The first one did not work properly, and Amazon was great and replaced it. Once we had the new one it has been a treat. One of the few cameras with a 4x zoom, and 7 megapixels. Loved the fact that you can turn the camera and the picture will adjust. I researched digital cameras, and this is one of the best."
1,why even have a macro button?,"This is a usable camera with a nice zoom feature and impressive battery life.Pros: The finished photos never have any jaggies, the interval between one picture and the next is very quick.Cons: What would have been a beautiful swan of a camera broke out of its shell way too soon. It has a portrait setting that works well enough, but the macro feature is completely useless. If you are doing anything artsy and with photography, this is not your camera.The wobble-sensor is always activated, even when the camera is set on a flat surface. You will not be able to capture detailed textures with this camera."
2,Sent it Back,"I hated this camera. If it's not held PERFECTLY STILL the pics are fuzzy. It has tons of bells & whistles, but the pics are horrible. Thank goodness my daughter found my missing Kodak! It cost half as much, & the pics are twice as good."
1,Do NOT buy!!!,"I had only had this camera for four months, and when I turned it on to take a picture, the viewing screen was all shattered. I was baffled because I didn't drop it and nothing had happened that would have caused that. I assumed it would be fixed under the one-year warranty, and when I shipped it back to be serviced by Canon, they had the nerve to tell me that it was my fault the screen was broken and I would have to pay $110 to fix it. When I asked to speak to a manager, the best he could do was offer to take 50% off my repair bill. I was furious, I did nothing to this camera, and was not going to pay a penny to have it fixed. I had a Kodak for five years and never had a problem with it!! I will NEVER buy anything from Canon again. This should not have happened to a NEW camera.!!"
2,arrived damaged,This camera arrived with a scratch on the viewing screen. Other than that it seems to be a good camera
2,Not what I expected,"I am no great techy and did not spend a lot of time in chosing my camera but I knew what I was looking for: a decent digital camera made by a reputable camera company, something easy to use and of reasonable price. I can say that the PowerShot A560 really disapointed me. First of all - it runs on AA batteries. My first day of using it (after only owning it for 4 hours)the low battery sign came on - and that was only after taking maybe 15 pictures (and no - the camera was not on for 4 hours straight). Also, anything that I used the zoom for came out fuzzy and poor quality. The pictures not taken with the zoom were very good. I am returning this today and will pay more for a sony"
5,OUTSTANDING!!!,I bought this camera for my mother for Christmas. She is very very un-tech savvy! I gave it to her on Christmas eve and she just kind of looked at it and I could tell she didnt htink she would ever get the hang of it enough to use it.I showed her how to use it. It really is basically point and click!By morning she was photographing everything she could and calling relatives and friends telling them about her new easy to use camera
4,Great little digital!,"Did extensive searching on various consumer and electronic websites for reviews before investing in this camera. I don't want ""bells & whistles"", but basic and simple design and function.Seems to be doing what it was advertised to be."
4,Nice digital but...,"Wished the shot had a little more resolution, but for the price, very useable features and user friendly. I also bought a uv filter and fog filter. They seem to benefit washed out colors. I hope the macro lense kit I ordered last week will take some nice detailed close-ups."
5,"So far, it's great","I haven't had the camera that long yet, but so far it's been great. No complaints whatsoever."
3,Get the 570,"I had a Canon A540 which I liked and wanted a replacement. I (foolishly) assumed that an A560 would retain the A540 features while upgrading to Digic III and 7.1 megawhatevers. WRONG! The A560 has different (less sophisticated) controls, does not have as many shooting modes, no manual mode, and burst speed is dog-slow. I went back to Amazon's website and read about the A570 which does have the A540 controls and features, adds image stabilization, upgraded DIGIC and pixels - and is only about $25 more. I point out that this mistake is not a big deal due to Amazon's wonderful return service. Good on Amazon, Bad on Canon for misleading product naming."
4,great camera,this is a great camera. diffrent settings for diffrents moods. i love going to the beach and to bars at night and to find a camera that takes great pics at such a bright setting as the beach and a dark setting as like a bar it has a setting for indoor night and beach it is great. the only downfall i do not like about this camera it is bulkier than my last 2 cameras but maybe thats the reason they broke they were to small...i would really recommed this camera to anyone who likes to travel and take alot of fantastic pics
3,"Got it today, is it me......?","Is it me or has the QUALITY of these digital cameras gone downhill? I am the owner of a VERY old Fuji 5MP camera (when 5MP were $400) and the image quality of the photos that Fuji takes is way better than this one boasting 7MP!! Also, I keep hearing how clear the LCD is, but on mine it has noise! Sure it is a large screen for the camera size, but the noise detracts alot from the image. On my old Fuji, the screen is flawless. I dont get it. Didi I get a defective cam or does every model contain the LCD noise that I speak of? Other than that, it seems to work fine and for $130 bucks, I guess a 7MP cam is pretty darn good despite the noisy LCD screen."
1,Not very durable,"I was disgusted when this camera stopped working after only 1 week. I bought the A560 to take on vacation, and kept it well-stored in a padded case. With less than 200 shots, the lens cover stopped opening/closing, and then the view screen died. (You could still preview a shot in movie mode, but not in camera mode, and you could still review stored pics - very strange.) The AA batteries tend to last only about 75 pictures, by the way, so keep plenty on hand. I had bought a Canon this time because neither of my Kodaks had held up more than one year, but I returned this and bought a Kodak Z712 instead."
1,Camera disappointment,"Although it looked good in theory, the PowerShot A560 has been a major disappointment in practice.The batteries die faster than fruit flies. I have inserted new batteries, only to find as I go for the quick, cute, candid shot of the dogs they've already died (the batteries, not the dogs).The design is just bulky enough to be annoying, with an area that curves out for the useless batteries. Because I wind up changing the batteries so often, the casing has now come loose and doesn't close properly. Definitely a camera that needs to be babied."
5,"Perfect camera, perfect service!!","The ad was truthful and service was beyond exceptional. Three days after ordering I had my camera and it is perfect. I own a Canon A560, I love that camera and really wanted a backup. I use it mainly for my two passions, photographing trees and my two dogs. Rather dissimilar subjects but it does great on both. I would not hesitate ordering from Pawn World in the future."
3,Not a bad camera,An. O.K. camera. Ended up giving it to my husband who likes it pretty well for a point and shoot camera.
5,Perfect for what it was purchased for,I got this camera for my father because he was all the time catching trophy fish and releasing them with no photo! Love the optical view finder... a must on a bright sunny day on the lake with a lot of glare. My folks are retired and travel a lot. This camera takes such nice photos that they often leave home mom's S3 IS and only take this camera because it is small and light!
5,great camera,"About all I can say, is I have had my 560 for over 3 yrs and no problems what so ever. It has been dropped, in the rain and snow and is still going strong. Great pictures. I don't think you could go wrong by buying one."
3,"Good camera, just don't drop it.","Good performance, no shock resistance. The performance of this camera was good enough that we got one for our teenager. She dropped it on a grass/dirt surface and jammed the lens. Canon fixed it fairly quickly (~$100). A few months later, it slipped ~2 feet onto a wooden floor. Lens failure again. Time to try something shock- and clutz-resistant!"
4,BUYER BEWARE ON THIS PRICE!!!!,"This camera is no longer current for Canon. Check the Canon web site. On their site they show retail price of $150. Why would you pay $400. My son-in-law recommended it, but also indicated it probably was no longer available from Canon unless they had some left over inventory. He also said he paid a little over $100 when he bought his. I guess Wall Street Photo is trying to subsidize the execs!"
5,Fabulous!,"This camera is perfect for someone who wants to take high quality pictures but does not need all of the extra technology. The camera has a lot of really cool features (self timer, black and white shots and sepia shots) and is super easy to use! I fully recommend it! However, make sure you buy rechargeable batteries and a charger- this camera does tend to suck up battery life pretty quick!"
4,Love It!!!!!!!,"I love this Camera, it takes wonderful pictures. The only down side is that you always need an extra set of batteries, because they don't last long. I keep rechargeable batteries with me when I know I will be taking alot of pictures. Other than that, the camera is easy to use. I would surely recommend it to anyone."
5,An upgrade from the Canon A60,"I have owned a Canon A60 (3X zoom and 2MP) for some years now and it took excellent pictures. Why upgrade? I wanted the 4X zoom and better resolution. The A560 has the 4X zoom and 7 MP. It is smaller and lighter than the A60 requiring only 2 AA batteries. The 2.5"" LCD is much bigger than the A60. It has a 16X digital zoom so I would suggest paying a bit more and buying the A570IS instead as it has the image stabiliser."
4,Highly recommended,"This is my first digital camera and I find it really great ! The photos quality is amazing and you can really do a lot with it. I'm sure this is not for professional photograph, but any newbie can easily be familiar with it and start making great shots in seconds. I loved especially the video quality and will defintely start use it in my videocasts. I bought separetly a tripod and a 4Gig SD card, the 16Mo delivered with it is usefull only for testing."
3,What's in the box?,"Amazon didn't tell me in their ad but - what's in the box. Do I need to buy a case, battery, memory card. What is in the box?"
2,NOT THAT GOOD AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE,"After reading comments, and comparing again and again the choices and gradings of an array of compact digital cameras of different brands, I finally decided to purchase this camera. In view of its high grading by both experts and enthusiasts, I ordered this Canon A560 from Amazon website. Tried it at home, the image appears to be washed out, the video taken has the same problem. Images taken in broad day light also appear to be washed out. The night view outside taken from the Sears Tower is horrible. My father has a Nikon; My sister has a Sony. The night images taken from their cameras are sharp and clear. The images taken from my new Canon A560 is nothing but blurs. I am so disappointed that I have to have this camera returned."
3,"Good camera, but not perfect.","Generally a great little camera - but has a few flaws worth noting.On the positive side - nice large screen - easy to navigate since the settings show up on the screen as you scroll through them [i.e. portrait, night shot, landscape, automatic, flash/no flash etc]. Does great daytime shots and flash - easy to flip from shoot mode to scrolling at images you've already taken - easy to upload - and most of all, shoots an excellent super high resolution image if you need shots that are print quality at large size. Best to have a 2 or 4g memory chip for this purpose.However it is a little slow to focus and does not do well in low light. Gets very grainy, out of focus, and does not pick up on existing light well at all.Love it as an every day camera to drop in my purse, but does not live up to professional standards.Haven't tried other lenses on it yet - some of the canon powershots do take macro lenses etc - not sure if this one will do that yet."
2,Broken,"I was so excited to get my first-ever digital camera, and I did my research to get this one. First digital camera, I was enamored with the macro and zoom and detail. As more cameras have come out, I'm missing certain features (not the point of this review).One year later, this camera is broken. I've never mishandled or misused it. One day, I pulled it out of the cupboard, put fresh batteries in, and the lcd screen on the back didn't work. And hasn't since. No rhyme or reason. I'm not rich, so I can't buy another camera, so I just settled for the optical viewfinder. That's fine, except that it doesn't line up the pictures correctly. If I aim at a tree for the center of the pic, the tree is almost out of the recorded picture. Of course, this messes up the auto focus as well... it doesn't know I'm shooting a picture of a tree, it thinks I'm aiming at the grass behind the tree...Frustrating!"
2,It broke after minimal use.,"I love Canon Products. However, I received the Canon PowerShot A560 for my Christmas present and it broke on me after one a month's use. And I only took about 60 pictures on it.I did travel to Africa with it. Perhaps the humidity got to it. I have not given up on Canon products yet. I just purchased the PowerShot SX10IS and I hope that one proves to be more reliable."
2,problem prone,"This is the 2nd Canon a-series camera I've had. Both have had problems relating to the lens cover. My daughter also had problems. Although the camera takes great pictures, the lens cover problems makes this series less than desirable. On the A560, the lens cover requires a finger nail assist to open. It's annoying after a while. My next camera will not be a Canon."
4,Canon PowerShot A560,This is a terrific basic digital camera -- easy to use and small enough to carry around all the time. Also great that it runs on AA batteries (though the battery/SD card compartment is a bit of a challenge to open and close!)
5,Great Stuff,"I had a perm a year ago, and with long hair I still had alot of curl. I didn't like the perm from day one, it would take me fourty minutes to staighten each morning. When I used one 'n only Curl Remover it was amazing!. My hair went from curly to straight. I'd recommend this product to anyone....it did wonders for me! My hair was not damaged after use, it was very soft."
4,From the Board Games Editor at BellaOnline.com,"The concept of this game is silly and fun: each player takes the part of an alien and tries to cross through an ocean on an alien land. The game board is a bit confusing at first (there are often several options of which way a player can go, and players are allowed to move both backwards and forwards), but it makes more sense once you've played the game for a few minutes. In order to make it back out of the alien ocean, the player must collect three fuel cells.The rules of the game are fairly complex and it will help to go over them a couple of times before attempting to play the game, but the diversity of all of the different rules and parts of the game board will surely keep kids interested. They'll want to play it over and over, and they'll learn while they do it. What more can you ask?One of the very best features of this game is that all of the science trivia questions come with a full explanation in an accompanying book (The Book of Y). Very cool!"
5,good pictures,I used this camera in the pool to get ready for our family cruise. It works great. You do need to read the manuel prior to use and follow the directions. Works great in water in the case and works great on land with very sharp pictures.
1,unhappy results,I purchased this camera for a friend to use in Hawaii. We had nothing but problems getting it to wind properly and the pictures both on land and underwater were all blurred and my friend was very unhappy and I was frustrated. I do not know if this is just a bad camera or what.
1,AWFUL!,I took this on a scuba diving trip in Hawaii...went down to 45 feet with amazing sealife around me...I even took a picture of myself holding a baby octopus....BUT NONE OF THE PICTURES CAME OUT!!!!!!!! NOT ONE!!!!!!!
4,English 111 Review of My Fair Lady,"In the story ""My Fair Lady"", George Bernard Shaw tells about how the attitude of people can change just by the language that they speak. He begins by telling about Eliza Doolittle and how all her life she has talked and acted like none of the people around her. She talks incorrectly and acted like a slob. But she meets these two men, Henry Higgins and Colonal Pickering and they take he in and end up changing her into a prim and proper lady who talks and acts correctly. I really enjoy this story because it makes me think about how people in that day and age would actually take someone under their wing and take the time to teach them the correct way to speak and act. This is a really good book and I encourage anyone that has the time to read it."
5,a voice as big as the big island,"As you first hear Sonny, you begin to imagine what he must have been like. Strong, powerful, true, yes I'm sure all of these. This album will stir you inside. Sonny's deep, rich voice, coupled by his splendid playing ability is what Hawaiian Music has always meant to me. Play this album when you want to ""think about your life"" and all its possibilities. too bad he's gone."
3,Ice Packs,"I work in a school office and really like Cramer Flex-I-Cold packs for the students. The 4x6 size is perfect and they are pretty durable and last quite long. I was excited to find them at a good price but when they arrived, it wasn't the item pictured! They ones we got are called Med-Gel by Medlogix. Very disappointing. Ice packs are the same size but a different, slippery packaging not soft/gel feel like Cramer."
2,Substitution product was sent,"I am a school secretary and really like Cramer Flex-I-Cold packs for the students. The 4x6 size is perfect and they are pretty durable and last quite long. I was excited to find them at a good price but when they arrived, it wasn't the item pictured. Very disappointing. I will say the icepaks are the same size as Cramer's but a different, slippery packaging not soft/gel feel like Cramer."
3,Some Issues,"I ordered 2 of these cases, one electric and the other for a bass. They are the same case, just one is bigger. The latches don't ever seem quite closed, but they are secure. The handle doesn't feel secure either, but it's not failed. Biggest issue is QA. Mine came with tears and rips and the compartment box wasn't screwed in. You could see the screw, but it wasn't connected to the box. My wife didn't want to hassle with returns and since it technically still works, I didn't press it. The electric case is maybe a bit too universal and could use some added neck stability. I usually found my neck out of the groove and it was moving around inside the case. I guess for [...] bucks, it's a pretty good deal and it does protect your guitar, if it stays put."
2,Not Too Satisfied,"I received the item in two days (thanks to Amazon Prime) but unfortunately, everything in the picture was not in the box, it was missing the seals and the adjustment screws and a few other things. Would Not Recommend to other buyers."
1,overpriced socks,"I bought what I thought was 3 packages of gold toe socks from this website for $10. What I got was 3 pairs of socks-that's $10 per pair, when the retail price on the tag was $5!.When I complained to Amazon, I got an email back telling me that I was receiving a refund of $15, so now I was paying exactly the retail price on the socks-but only getting 3 pair when I needed 9 pair. I wrote back and never got any response.Be warned! Now I see that they are doing the same thing. $5 socks are being advertised at 3 for $7.50, but if you check carefully when you try to buy them, you are really agreeing to pay $7.50 per pair for $5 socks.Since Amazon is refusing to respond to my follow up complaint, I guess I will have to buy the other six pair of socks from a different website or go to my local store to buy them. Incredible!"
5,love these socks,I have had these socks for about a year and they are the right color and fit well. Would recommend. The stores sell a multi-color pack but I only want the oatmeal color. Was pleased to located this product.
1,vastly overpriced,"These socks came with a manufacturer tag showing the price as 3 for $12. The socks are fine (although a little thinner than I expected), but there are surely better values around."
1,Not up to par,"I've gone through several portable players and this one turned out to be disappointing. It is way too noisy for a ""quality"" piece of electronics. The white noise in the headphones is excessive. It also skips a little too easily. It is well constructed and very compact but the white noise is unacceptable. Not worth buying."
2,An album I can live without,"Synthetic, repetitive and when played loudly (as it should be) headache inducing. Listen to it though, it might be your style although it leaves me flat. More layer, variation and texture are needed to get a better rating from me. DJ Cam is my suggestion on how to do this better."
1,Low quality,The sound quality on the CD sucks. It sounds like the music is coming from a cassette tape. Shipping was prompt. For the price paid the quality should be much better than it is.
3,Best Song,"This soundtrack has the best rendition of the song ""Crying"" that I have ever heard. K.D. Lang is not one of my favorites, but she outdid herself on this duet with Roy Orbison. This song makes this otherwise ho hum collection priceless."
5,"""Crying"" by Orbison/Lang","For years I've been trying to find ""Crying"" sung by Roy Orbison and k.d. lang (written by Patsy Cline). I finally found it -- that it was on this soundtrack, thus this purchase. I was pleased with it."
5,Touches the Mind and the Heart,This book engages children of all ages as well as the adults who may be reading to them. Both my 7 year old daughter and my soon-to-be 11 year old son were drawn in by the relevance of the stories as well as the simple yet captivating images - which delighted even my 2 year old. The questions posed stimulated their imaginations and at the same time made God accessible. They were free to wonder about a God who now seemed more like a friend. A great work is one that touches not only our minds but our hearts. This book does just that.
5,Great Teaching Tool - Triggered Lots of Questions,"I found this book great for triggering discussion with my four-year old and a six-year old friend about the nature of God. It presents a series of scenarios and questions designed to help children explore different aspects of God. From watching clouds, to the changing seasons, to feeling lonely, it uses experiences young children can readily relate to as springboards for spiritual questions. The vision of God that emerges is anthropomorphic in nature, and this may make it more appropriate for those with Judeo-Christian leanings, but it is most definitely non-denominational, and its exploratory nature left room for a non-affiliated believer like myself to feel comfortable."
4,Expensive online,"My only complaint is the cost of this seasoning online. I only bought it to see if this is the one I wanted. Some time ago, I bought these large bottle of the ""Table"" blend by mistake which turned out to be mostly pepper and was very disappointed. The ""Original"" blend is the one that has the best flavors, NOT the ""Table"" Blend.The service is very good, however, so would shop here again."
4,GREAT USB-MODEM!,"I've been using this modem for the last 3 months, and I thinkits great! Though there is one minor annoyance that I found... ittends to make alot of noise if you don't turn your call waiting off, and somebody tries to call you. There's no way to reset it either without going offline. Other then that its a great deal, which will upgrade your overall download speed. END"
1,Does not work properly on Windows XP,"This modem has all sorts of incompatibility issues with Windows XP over the USB connection. Mine never powers on when I start my computer, I have to yank out the usb cord and plug it back in each time. Bad driver support as well. The rest of these reviews are very misleading and make me wonder if they were written by people who work for the company. After all the modem has been discontinued"
1,A Real Bummer,Bought this because of reviews. Could not get it to install. CD ROM no help. No 800 number for tech support (I don't pay for installation support). Sent unit back.
3,Sustain Pedal works but seems a bit too light in construction,Although the cost was low and the pedal does provide a sustain for my older keyboard (casio wk1200) ... I'm a bit disappointed with the fact it is a bit too light under foot. For the few extra bucks the heavier foot pedal would be better. I gave it a 3 because This guy (on tile or other than carpet) tends to run away from you...other than that... for the price (if you're saving bucks) don't hesitate to purchase it.
4,Sustain Pedal,"This pedal is your basic sustain pedal. It is well worth getting, as it adds to the performance of the keyboard. It doens't take long to get used to how much pressure is needed for the desired effect. For the price , it really is hard to beat."
4,Casio Sustain Pedal,The Casio Sustain Pedal was just what I needed. Ordering was easy and delivery was quick. Good product.
1,BEL CANTO...PART 1 & 2..ON DVD...,"TOOOOOO!MUCH TALK....FROM SO CALLED? PEOPLE WHO ""KNOW""...? I DON'T THINK SO.....SOME OF THE PEOPLE LOOK LIKE THEY ARE NOT ALL THERE...AND ARE VERY ANNOYING..ONE OF THEM EVEN TRIES TO SING, HIS NAME IS STEFAN ZUCKER HE SOUNDS LIKE A(DYING CAT)AND HE HAS THE NERVE TO TALK ABOUT..CARUSO,GIGLI ,SCHIPA,McCORMACK.....I DON'T THINK SO...!!...THEY SHOULD STOP THE BULL TALK AND PLAY MORE OF THE MOVIE..IF I NEW THEN WHAT I KNOW NOW..I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THE DVD'S....SAVE YOUR MONEY...BOB"
3,Nice but. . .,"Very pleased with the stand, and the globe itself has wonderful features, but indeed the seams at the middle of the globe do not meet evenly. For this price I had expected way more of a perfect product."
4,good deal on power pro line,good material also a pleasure doing business with these people will return to web site and purchase more of thier products.
3,some good some bad,it is hit or miss with power pro. i have got spools that didnt have any flaws in the line. and i have got spools that have many flaws in the line. this spool had a couple. power pro says it is ok i disagree for the kind of money it costs it shouldnt have flaws. and power pro will not replace it. its a gamble
5,Good line,Perfect line for my fishing need. I used it on coastal fishing and sport fishing on a boat.. a review is a review. please don't ask me how many words I have to type to the review.. I may not do another review again.
2,Great product at a good price but process took too long,"The product was exactly as described. However the processing part was way too slow. All other items ordered with this product arrived much sooner then expected. I expected this item to arrive a few days after purchase, not a week and a half. Change processing policy and future buyers will be very please with your service."
5,A must have for a Salsa collector,I am a huge Frankie Ruiz fan. This CD is worth the money just for the 16 minute mixed song of many of his songs on disc 2. Most of his great songs are these CDs. I highly recommend it.
3,"excelent feature, not so great on size and quality of materials","It's a great product since it does what it offer. Cons it came with only 1 size, and the quality of the materials seems to be not as good as it could be, but again, it's extremly easy to install and it does exactly what it's supose to do."
2,A game? Thot these were headphones...,"Bought as a gift but on receipt find we have a gamer set of headphones, I wanted something more for use on a home TV or such to keep from disturbing a parent or whomever. So it sits UNOPENED. No idea what its fidelity is, I already have 2 conventional but wired headphones.....SOIs this THING suitable for halfway decent autio? Or games only, ie BANG CRASH SHAZAM KILL KILL KILL and EXPLOSION right or left probably is not enouogh fidelity....Yeah Maybe a refund WOULD be nice!L"
5,A good product serves its purpose,I bought this product mainly for watching TV while walking on tread mill. My tread mill is too noise and I can't hear very well. It serves my purpose.
2,Wii Wireless Headphone So -So,Pro:Works Ok.Cons:Some noise.Headphone is a bit to small for an adult head.The entire product is built very cheaply.Would have hurt the vendor to use a thicker gauge wire in the audio jacks?
1,Pay the extra for the step up model,I bought this because I like to play my games at night and still be able to hear them without the rest of the family having to put up with the music and sound effects. These work but I think they are more designed for children with the way the headset wraps around the ear. If I am wearing these for more than an hour they begin to hurt my ears from the uncomfortable plastic applying pressure on my ears. I have since given these to my 9 year old daughter and placing an order for the model that has cushioned ear support and the strapping is designed to go on top of your head instead of going behind your neck.
3,A little worried from first impression...,"I just received these a few days ago. I intentionally got them to play games and watch Netflix on my Wii.Getting the headphones out of the plastic case was actually more difficult than the hooking them up to the TV/Wii. They seemed to work fine for the first hour I used them. Then...the next time I tried to use them, I was having issues with them just cutting out. I had to mess with the on/off switch for a while, but doing so would only correct the problem for a few seconds. I'm not sure if I had some kind of interference with other electronic devices or if it just had to work out some kinks, but...now they seem to work fine.The sound quality could be a little better, but it's expected for the price (I paid about $20). I think they are sufficient enough for what I use them for, and the price wasn't too bad. The design (back of head over ears) is pretty cheesy but...all in all a pretty decent buy."
2,a disappointment,"The choice of music was good, but the recording was terrible. The levels were all over the place, and you can just barely hear the piano.Even if this wasn't ideally recorded live, why wasn't it fixed in the remix?"
3,"nice, but food gets caught in the corners","Nice bowl and a nice size, but the inside isn't sloped, so food gets caught in the corners. If the sides sloped, I would give it 5 stars."
5,Had to find another!,"For a while I was picking up one Christmas book a year. I can't remember where I found this book originally but it has been one of my ""must put outs"" for the Christmas season. It is quirky and funny and the illustrations are vivid and perfect for the writing. This year I had the book out on the coffee table with some other favorites and our puppy decided to chew on the binding. I looked here on Amazon and am thrilled to find several copies available!"
3,"Slick, fast, great price... but poor service from Iomega","I love the drive. It is fast, compact, sturdy, and a great price. However, I guess the first copy I got was damaged in shipping, or maybe just a lemon. I bought the drive because my computer hard-drive was full. I should have been more careful, but I transfered all my wedding photos (I am a wedding photographer) on to the new drive and deleted them from my computer (BIG MISTAKE). The drive crashed 3 days later, and would not connect to any computer. When I called Iomega... they said I could get a new one, but that to get the data off the crashed drive, they would charge me like $1,500.00, as that was not in the warranty. Needless to say, I couldn't afford it and lost ALL the data. I guess I should have been more careful, but part of me is pissed off that the drive crashed. Amazon was AWESOME, they sent me a replacement before I had even returned the old one!"
5,Great product!,"I got this product specifically to store multimedia files that I would need to access with as much speed as possible, and I have not been disappointed! Especially for the price, it's a great, reliable external drive."
2,customer service is terrible,"I bought the 750GB drive a little over 6 months ago. It worked fine for 4 months,then began making strange ,repetitive noises and not being detected by my computer. I went to Iomega's website and found it impossible to contact a person even after providing my credit card info for a $25 charge just to possibly speak to someone. I got the cyber run-around. I finally was able to find an e-mail address- they don't make it easy- and sent a message complaining of all of the above. One week later I was fortunate enough to be home to answer a phone call from an Iomega rep who waived the $25 fee(what a company!)Based on my description of the problem,he said it needed to be replaced,gave an RMA#, I sent the thing in and got a replacement in a few weeks.The drive might end up OK, But I probably will not purchase another Iomega product after my experience with them."
2,Try another Brand,This drive worked well for three months then died. Iomega sent me another that wouldn't work at all. I've returned it also. Each time it costs $9 to return it and a week with no drive and you loose all data on that drive. You can't talk with a human at their Support. Overall quite a poor experience. Lesson: alway backup with more than one drive (difficult if using auto-backup) and try another brand.
5,A must see movie!,"my name is Lori i am almost 21 and i rremeber going to the video store when i was little girl always wanting to rent this movie, i always didn't get my way but if i put up a big enough figth i would get it! i lvoed this movie to death! it is a great movie for families alll ove r to watch together, i hope that it soon will be re-released, i also have aniece named Savannah so i would like to get her a copy as well. to all the Savannah Smiles fans, keep smiling and forever remeber the movie in your hearts!"
5,This movie was absolutely precious!,"When I saw this movie in 1982, I fell in love! Of course I was only 9 years old so I didn't think about owning it at that time. Several years ago I began my search for this movie that captured my heart. Still have yet to find it! Please re-release this movie I would love for my children (if and when I have children) to be able to watch it!"
2,savannah smiles,picture quality was extremly poor using roku boxotherwise family enjoyed the movielooks like it was copied off a vhs movie
1,A horrible copy. Don't buy,This was a terrible copy. I didn't watch it right away so I didn't think that I could return it. It looks like a very poor copy of a VHS tape. DO NOT BUY!
5,I love this movie,I love this movie. I haven't seen it since 1989 when I was 16 years old. I am so glad to find this movie at a good price. So many movies from this time period are still not released on DVD. I'm glad this one has been.
5,Gift for the wife.,One of her all time favorites glad I was able to find it on Amazon for a great price. Thanks.
4,My favorite movie from the 80's,"Quality in picture is ok. I didn't notice anything too terrible, but I'm not particular about whether I watch HD TV, etc. I absolutely love this movie from my childhood."
4,Savannah Smiles,"This is a funny, heart warming movie that I have hunted for years. It's great to have found it!"
3,5 for the movie -2 for the quality,"This is a great movie. The problem is the quality of this DVD is AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. It looks like someone took a camera and shot it at a poor VHS copy of the movie. I've seen movie theater bootlegs better quality than this! Maybe the VHS is better, but warning, the DVD is BAD BAD BAD quality. I'm not being overdramatic. Try to find a better quality release."
5,This movie is so awesome!,"I remember watching Savannah Smiles in the 80's and I loved it. It has always been one of my three favorite movies. In 1995, I found a vhs copy in Las Vegas but I am so glad I discovered it is on DVD. It's such a sweet, touching film and Bridgette Andersen is a natural actor and so adorable. I can't wait for Savannah Smiles to arrive in my mailbox."
5,savannah smiles,this movie makes me laugh and cry all the way through. i have friends who named their daughters savannah after the girl in the movie.
1,Poor Production,"I'm rating this 1 star purely on the quality of this release, not the movie itself. I love the movie, but both the audio and video looks and sounds like a poor tape conversion. I made the mistake of buying this DVD for $19.99 and have ordered a new production released by Anchor Bay, which I'm assuming will be of decent quality. Don't pay $39.99, wait for the new release, it can't be any worse and it's available in the $10 range."
4,Sweet Smiles,"This is a sweet memory of my childhood. I cry almost every time I watch it. I reminds my of how fast and precious childhood is and how generous children can be. Not a guy movie maybe, but a tender and moving picture of the power of a childs love. Not a must see but a cute special worthwhile see."
5,Took me forever,I had been looking for this video for years on VHS. I was unable to find it (even on Amazon). Then one day decided to look again- and I was able to find it. It was packaged very well so not much could have happened to it and it was here by the time stated. I will use amazon again for any online ordering I do.
5,Patricia Gray+,"Savannah SmilesWe just love the video you sent. We expected a video tape, not a CD.My grand-daughter just loves this movie. Something happeded to the orignal we had. I thought of your company to relace it. We are all happy now!"
5,Savannah Smiles,Really liked this movie very much. Very heartwarming. I was sad to learn that the little girl that played Savannah (Bridgette Andersen) had died some years later of a drug overdose. How Tragic! She was such a beautiful child in this movie.
5,makes me smile,watched this movie years ago and enjoyed the fun and innocence of it so much that it was added to my collection. just researched and found that she died at 21. she made that movie so great.
5,loving smile,Thank you so much. I've been looking for this DVD for years. The price was great and the product arrived in wonderful condition.
2,Horrible Quality - Bootleg feel,Based on the glowing reviews I expected this to be a wonderful movie. The story was great but the quality of this DVD was embarrassing considering I gave it as a gift to a sick child who needed to smile. She loved the story but we were embarrassed by what looked like a recording made by a camcorder off a screen much like a bootleg DVD. This is not what I would expect when buying from Amazon. Steer clear of this supplier.
4,GREAT MOVIE!,"This is a fantastic movie that kids of today and yesterday will love and want to watch over and over again... Bootsie and Alvie make great characters, even if they are two old crooks with not much going for them. It's a heartwarming story that shows the good in people when there doesn't seem to be any at first glance....Definitely a keeper!"
5,Love it !,"I grew up watching Savannah Smile,I always wanted to be Savannah. Growing up in Utah, where it happened, I thought it was a local film I'm so glad to hear that peopl all over love it as much as I do. I wish I could find a good copy of it."
5,I GOT IT!,"I recently typed a review for this movie. After doing so I was talking to my sister about not being able to find it. Well for Christmas what did I receive from her?---Savannah Smiles! Thanks Kim! You really did pay too much for it, but thanks!"
5,"I LIKE ""FEEL GOOD"" MOVIES WITH HUMOR AND A GOOD ENDING",Great family move. Loved Bridgette Andersen and the other actors. This was entertaining and (one of my favorite things) had a good ending.
3,Savannah Smiles,"I have seen other movies of this on DVD and they were good. Yet, i wanted to own my own copy. I didn't think that they made DVD's in a 'long playing' format, but this is like we use to tape lp on the videos. I was able to see it....but it was not clear....not even as clear as an old video...that I taped. I know it was used but the seller said nothing about it being this way...in fact, it was 98% or more good. I do not call this good. I have bought many used tapes with less percent of good to them, and they were better than this one. Sorry!"
5,SAVANNAH SMILES,A FAVORITE MOVIE AND WANTED TO REVIEW IT ONE MORE TIME..nOW i CAN SEE IT ASOFTEN AS I LIKE. SAVANNAH SMILES
4,Too Cute!,"This movie may be a little ""smaltzy"", but it is a very touching movie. You can't help but feel sympathy for Alvie(Miller) and Bootsie (Donovan) from the beginning of the movie. And Savannah (Bridget Anderson) is captivating. It is discernible from the beginning of the movie that all three characters have emotional needs. Alvie wants someone to love him, Savannah needs attention, and Bootsie just wants to take care of someone. When chance and circumstances put these three together, they become a perfect fit. Savannah's parents are pretty much occcupied, however, you do see glimpses that mom is at least sublimnally aware of her shortcomings - dad is just an egotistical jerk. Peter Graves character is the epitome of ""stupid"", but it fits with the comedic timbre of the film.The ending is a little somber and sad, but it is well fit into the overall flow of the movie. Maybe not an oscar winner, but definitely a movie that deserves to be seen.PS - I love the title song."
2,"Movie...Good, Quality...Terrible","The video quality is attrocious. My VHS copy (probably 20 years old and watched 100's of times) is twice the quality of this DVD. Someone recorded it off of a VHS with cruddy equipment, then burned it on a DVD and printed a cover for it."
2,Quality of movie is beyond horrible!,"The item arrived on time with no problems. I was so excited to open it and watch it with my kids but when the movie started the quality was so bad I wanted to turn it off about 30 seconds into it! Horrible, horrible, horrible! Its as if they held a video camera up to the tv set in 1980 and hit record! Not even wasting my time returning it for 10 bucks!"
3,"1000 Dessous, interesting, but risque","This is an interesting book with lots of full color and contemporary depictions of historical lingerie, but tends to rely too heavily on the pornographic aspects of women's underwear, and includes many photos which are purely historical pornography and bear no connection to lingerie. Maybe I'm just a prudish American, but I expected more history, and maybe a little text."
5,Great stuff!,"I am not sure why there are few details given in the Amazon blurb, although my version is on a different label with a different cover. The performers are the Goldner String Quartet who have worked extensively with Sculthorpe.This is brilliant stuff: The music and the performance. I strongly recommend you get this and Volume 1. I also hear that Volume 3 is about to be released (4-09). These cover all of Sculthorpe's string pieces even if not called a quartet. Volume 3 will bring us up to the present although I believe he has been commissioned to write more. STRONGLY recommended as beautiful and deep music with a unique Australian flavour."
2,deceitful title,"I read in one review posted above ""and you are (or aspire to be) a vegan, then this book is definitely for you."" is this a JOKE? THIS reader obviously did not open this book at all! the term ""vegetarian"" in used so freely that people that eat a burger a week are considered ""semi-vegetarians"". What is that supposed to mean? And what about ""pesco-vegetarians""? This guide is a joke. If you take veganism or vegetarianism seriously, don't waste your money on this title. However, I give it 2 stars because it has some information on vitamins and other supplements. Yet, I can get the same advice from any other ""omni/carnivore"" regular nutrition book."
5,good supplement,Don't go off your meds and just take this but it works very well as asupplement to your program. I take 2 once or twice a day.
3,dreary and depressing,"It's hard to fault a man with such a distinguished portfolio of work as an actor or director, but ""Jesus Christ"" Clint you sure do know how to make a depressing movie.Can't say I like much about this movie, except for the dog.As dreary as the unforgiven."
2,Blah!,"Let's just say I expected a better story line and more action after seeing the previews. However, action for a seventy-something year old man might be a little difficult. I can honestly say that this movie wAs just ALRIGHT."
2,Dirty Harry mets Grumpy Old Men....,"I guess this movie wasn't trying to be funny, but it was a comedy for me none-the-less. After spending an hour of the film trying to convince us what a ""hard-***"" he is, Eastwood's character then begins to transform himself into something more ""PC"" before his death. Not that I'm in favor of gangs ruling neighborhoods, but let's face it - an army of crusty old white guys with bad prostates and bladder issues running around with guns in old 70's vehicles isn't the solution! I'm guessing the only people that might enjoy this film are seniors rather desperately trying to relive the prime years of their lives."
3,Not Good,"Not a good movie. Not horrible, but Clint Eastwood plays the same tough-guy character he plays in every movie. Predictable, unbelievable plot. I couldn't finish it."
5,Once a Marine,"This is a movie about a retired Marine who gets a little lost and finds his way home. A man who served his country, his family and his community. I've known a few like the main character and Eastwood does an excellent job portraying him. He reminded me of my Uncle Jack. Hero (Medals and all), WWII and Korea. I saw the show in the theater and decided I wanted a copy to save. It's a great guy flick."
5,Clint Eastwood at his BEST as a character actor,"Clint Eastwood really does act well. His character begins as a frustrated and negative Korean War Veteran/Retired Auto Worker who is hateful of his Asian neighbors. But as the movie progresses, he softened by his neighbors love and generosity. By the end of of this film, Clint becomes quite fond of his Asian neighbors and makes a great sacrifice to eliminate a violent gang. I enjoyed this film very much and so will you."
5,"Thank you, Thank you!","Order was placed close to the holiday with no guarantee that it would arrive by December 24. I fully understood this. To my surprise, it was received rather quickly and was able to be included with other holiday gifts under the tree. Since this is a favorite movie of the recipient, I was especially grateful. The service exceeded all expectations."
4,Great movie,"I don't think I've ever heard so many racial slurs in a movie, but dang, that was good. I loved Eastwood's hard-nosed character and how he wouldn't take crap from anyone, and whipping Thao into shape and helping him down a better path. The ending was rather bittersweet but appropriate.If my own family was like that (talking about taking me to a retirement home on my birthday!!!) I'd be the same way towards them. The poem 'Do Not Go Into the Good Night' came to mind when I finished watching this film because of Eastwood's character and his toughness. Overall great movie, 4.5/5 stars."
5,Amazing,"This is a state of the art film.It,s amazing how eastwood seems to be better than ever.In few words it's a ""Gran"" story and a ""Gran"" movie. Thanks Clint for the wonderful moments you gave to me."
2,"As one of my favorite actors, this was too far to the left even for him.","I've grown up with actors and actresses still living and lots of them deceased. I was born in the 19, yes 1940's so stop the snickering in the background. Movies then were real: in other words, credibility. They weren't slapped together, artificial. The abusive, violent language that producers allow to make a few bucks is not worth hearing or seeing.Throw this movie ( sorry Clint) in the trash can!"
5,Blu-Ray Review,"Amazon, why won't you post my review? What is wrong with Amazon?Excellent movie and Blu-Ray."
5,WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST MOVIE OF 2008,"This movie had everything you'd ever want in a story. Humor, drama, real-life terror situations, you name it. An amazing ending to an amazing story."
5,Loved this movie,There is much more to Clint Eastwood than I thought. It's not just Dirty Harry and 'go ahead and make my day' etc. This was a touching betrayal of a tough guy 'at least on the surface' and some cultural challenges and barriers broken and new friendships and love and compassion and ultimate courage and the ultimate sacrifice and it's very entertaining too boot and loved the ending. I really loved this movie and hope Clint is around and making and starring in movies for many years to come. I would like to rate this movie higher than 5 stars if more were available.
4,Grand Torino,"This movie has lots of foul language, a lot of f-words, but if you can get past that it is an excellent movie. Clint Eastwood still has it!"
5,My favorite Clint Eastwood movie.,"I generally don't like Clint Eastwood movies, but I loved this one. It is a very good story of an elderly man who befriends his Hmong neighbors. It is this movie that impresses me of how great of a director Eastwood is!"
1,Gran Torino,this movie was a downer. bad things happen to people and to the star. would not care to watch it again. i purchased it because of media hype. Clint Eastwood is a top star and actor. but the movie left me very unhappy.
1,DISAPPOINTED!,"I purchased this DVD because I so love Clint, but...I was really disappointed ,the acting was so bad, characters unknown, and down-right embarrassing! And, then I recall another movie Clint was in: Bronco Billy, and that sucked also....i do not recommend wasting you time or money on this movie!"
1,Kinky Klint,"Another morbid downer from kinky Clint. Vain, bitter old man, disappointed in life and especially his family, sort of gets to know his foreign neighbors and uses their problems as reason to die. Are you cheered up yet? A movie about a man who's learned nothing made by a director who in my opinion has learned nothing, except how to stay weird enough to keep Hollywood interested. This movie is an absolute zero in my book. I got sucked in by the reviews that this was a really great Clint performance. Wrong. Just a lot of silly profanity. Save your money, and skip it."
4,Great Video and Audio Quality,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.The video of this Blu-Ray is fantastic. I didn't see any grain at all. In fact, even when paused, the video is perfect, and without grain. I give it 10 out of 10. This movie must have been recorded digitally, instead of on film. The audio is great also (Dolby TrueHD 5.1), but don't expect a lot of surround sound, since most of the movie is dialog. The surround speakers do kick in when appropriate."
5,Clint Eastwood A+++ movie,This movie will keep your attention as most Eastwood movies do. It is so sad that the movie portrays what does go onin our large cities. I don't like the street language but it is realistic which is sad. Watch it !
2,Can't believe so many poeple like this!,"Disappointing tale from Clint Eastwood. Clint plays an grumpy old racist who learns to love his next door immigrants. Yeah, it's just as bad as it sounds. I have to say, I thought the first half was absolutely HILARIOUS! Clint's character was just so over-the-top, I figure it had to be camp/caricature. The way he comes up with new way to insult everyone? And goes around growling like a dog? Too funny! (And here's hoping that it was supposed to be funny, otherwise the movie's worse than I feared.) The second half of the movie really goes downhill, and becomes a kind of 'Karate Kid' in reverse (this time, the adult is American and the kid is Asian). The lone bright spot of the movie is the teenage girl who lives next door - she's a firecracker, and the movie is better every time she is on the screen. But otherwise, this is boring and predictable, something you don't usually get from Eastwood."
1,Gran Torino,HORRENDOUS- What can be seen on our streets/in our schools every day...why pay for/be'enertained'by/ this???
1,Gran Torino DVD,I cannot rate this DVD as it does not work. I've heard this movie is excellent. I wish I could find out how to return/exchange.
1,Gran Torino,"I wish I never bought this because it was a big waste of money. My daughter said that I would love it and she was wrong. I definitely should have rented it. Personal preference, I guess. I'm sure some people thought it was great. Not me."
4,DVD,Serious drama. Heart felt but a one time view. Make sure that you get the best price cause you may not want to watch it more than once.
4,Really good movie!,It is definitely not what I thought it was about. But when all is said and done it really is a good movie.
4,GRAN TORINO DVD,"Received product in fast shipping time. The used DVD froze/skipped in one little spot - otherwise, fine!!"
4,Good eye opener.,Nice to see how Clint's character changed his tune after getting to know the neighbors. Its an eye opener on the reality of gang violence too. The movie was sad though as he made the ultimate sacrifice to save the kids and teach them to make the right choices. Clint Eastwood was great.
5,A Distinctive Film in the Eastwood Tradition,"Unlike many of the Dirty Harry films this one is poinant and real. The character Eastwood portrays as a former auto worker was very much like my grandfather. His values are tested when someone attempts to finish his new neighbors. I have to reccomend this one because we get to see a sensitivity that Eastwood ever revealed to his viewers in a long time. If your expecting Dirty Harry, look out, it's far different than I'd ever thought it'd be. An excellent contender for an Oscar. If you can buy this one. You'll want to watch it more than once."
5,EXCELLENT!!,"Fantastic film and certainly not what I expected. Clint Eastwood dominates the screen like Darth Vader with COPD, growling his way through the movie. Since I don't want to spoil the story line and ending by talking too much, I'll just say that this film is definitely a masterpiece."
5,The best,Clint really played this part well. I loved how he made a big turn around from hating a race from the Korean war to befriending his korean neighbors.
5,Love this movie,I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. She has always wanted the movie. we have watched it so many times. LOVE Clint Eastwood!!
5,AMERICAN VALUES WHERE HAVE YOU GONE.,"GREAT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY, WELL YES I DO IT'S SO TRUE. IN SO MANY WAYS, THE [...]GRANDAUGHTER ASKING FOR THE CAR EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS DISRESPECTFUL TO THE EXTREME. THE NEIGHBORHOOD BEING IN A CONSTANT STATE OF DISREPAIR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE HOUSE. I WEEP FOR THIS COUNTRY. THIS MOVIE SPELLS OUT SO MANY THINGS THAT WE WON'T OR DON'T WANT TO RECONIZE. SOME OF YOU WILL RIP ON MY CONSTANT SPELLING ERRORS AS A WAY TO DISTRACT YOU FROM THE TRUTH BUT WE ALL KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING. THE MAIN CHARACTER WHILE FLAWED SHOWED ME, IF NOT ALL WHO SAW THIS MOVIE HOW FLAWED AND SHALLOW OUR LIVES HAVE BECOME, THANK YOU CLINT EASTWOOD AND BRAVO."
5,A Very Human Film,"This is by far one of the best films to come in a long time. Eastwood's Kowalski is so completely human .. a hardened exterior created by his war experience, working 50 years in Detroit's auto factories, struggling to hold onto his life in the form of his home after his wife dies and the neighborhood changes.The friendship he develops with the Chinese teen is real. The scene where Eastwood has learned he is dying of lung cancer, and calls his shallow family on the phone and they blow him off really hit home.This is a film about a tough everyman, who stands-up to adversity, the tragedy of his past and failed family, and has a real impact on some young people for whom he initially has nothing but contempt. This is Eastwood's best, and he shows a dimension of himself that hasn't been seen before."
5,Eastwood is one of the Greatest,Clint Eastwood directs and takes the lead in this epic story of the diverse cultural mix that our society is made up of today. The movie has plent of gritty Eastwood humour but is hard hitting and serious at the same time. This is a must see.
4,A must see,"Clint is great in this, but not in the usual way. He becomes endearing and the ending is a great twist on things."
3,Eastwood in good form,"I imagine there are many war veterans in blue-collar America just as bigoted as Walt Kowalski. But if Walt were played by a less well-known actor, the character's extreme one-dimensionality would probably have seemed more improbable than it does. The picture is tolerable because I, like most movie-goers, am used to Clint's being Dirty Harry and making his points efficiently and with a minimum of subtlety. Of course, the rest of the characters are equally cliched. I will say that Clint's films seems more graceful at it than Charles Bronson's. The climactic scene is a bit of a surprise, but I wonder what would have happened had the bad guys waited for Clint to fire the first shot. I guess the message in all this is that we need to figure out how to accept the incursion of other cultures into our blue-collar neighborhoods."
4,Not bad,"Clint Eastwood played the role of Walt Kowalski pretty well, and the movie was good for the most part except for a few sappy scenes. Overall enjoyable."
2,"OK, but not what I expected","Being a huge Clint Eastwood fan, I expected a lot more action than this film had. I knew basically what it was about, but again, not enough action, and truthfully, half the time I was waiting for something to happen, but it didn't. There was far too much sitting around staring at the neighbors to suit me, and the film was much too long to say what it had to say. I might have liked the film better if the ending would have been a bit more upbeat, at least. But, I guess, I should have expected it after it became obvious that Eastwood's character had health problems and something had to be done to bring the bad guys to a closure."
3,Gran Torino,"This item was what I ordered; although, it did not specify ""widescreen"" when I purchased it and I would have preferred full screen."
2,Gran Torino,"Despite a lifelong spent watching Clint Eastwood play many different parts, while I expected this film to be very good, in truth it's merely average and so it disappointed me.In my estimation, ""Unforgiven"" is Eastwood's best film."
2,"Great concept, poor execution","Clashing cultural values, inner city troubles, and Clint Eastwood. Sounds great, and it should have been a phenomenal movie. Unfortunately, the dialogue was embarrasingly poor, and the acting made me laugh at inappropriate moments.The story is powerfully important, but the script/acting got in the way. Too bad.Verdict: Watch the trailer, then skip the movie."
2,A lot of fuss over nothing....,"This movie is about the importance of collecting valuable possessions over your lifetime and giving them to who you think is most deserving. Clint Eastwood did not think his family was worthy of his car or the valuable set of tools he accumulated over 50 years, so he gave them to the Cambodian family from next door because they gave him food. I thought the whole ordeal was very shallow and unnotable."
5,"gran torino, another great movie with clint eastwood","this movie is a great feel good movie, one with a powerful lesson for all, which tells of what lenth one will go to, to save a life from the pits of the gang life, this is a must see if you are a clint eastwood fan."
5,Rent this movie today*Not a Spoiler*,"If you haven't seen this movie yet, please go rent it today. Don't read other reviews, just rent this. Since I wrote this review, there are only 13 reviews that are three stars or below. The rest of the 123 reviews are four stars and above. That should tell you something in it's self. This was one of my first Eastwood movies as an actor I've ever seen. I'm happy I picked this up. Within five or so minutes I was already hooked to Eastwoods character and the film. I didn't look away for a second. The film should not bore anybody. The film is not a comedy but there were many funny moments. The story had a deep meaning and I'm sure everybody can learn from this movie. Everybody needs to see this movie. Tell your friends and don't sit around, rent it today. Enjoy."
4,Not your typical grandpa,"Clint Eastwood is brilliant as the racist, redneck widower who has no connection with his children or their children. His interaction with his ""Gook"" neighbours are heart-warming and funny at the same time. His confrontation with the baby-faced ""virgin"" priest is another highlight.Recommended"
2,Gran Torino don't buy,"In short this Gran Torino blu ray movie other than being super clear and sharp, nothing else is great. The story line is simple and boring."
2,"Great story line, TERRIBLY supporting actors/actresses","Eastwood, even in his old age, still has it. But he obviously needs better supporting actors/actresses around him. I'm not sure if he randomly picked these people out of a box or off the street, but c'mon."
2,Ostatni film Eastwooda?,"'Gran Torino' jest filmem przeznaczonym dla entuzjastow pestek slonecznikowych, dlubanych na zywca. Pozostali, oprocz najbardziej zagorzalych fanow Clinta Eastwooda, moga z powodzeniem odpuscic ten dwugodzinny niewypal. Rezyser filmu, Eastwood, gra tu role kultywujacego swoja odrebnosc i skloconego z siasiadami zgorzknialego weterana Wojny Koreanskiej, ktory w zaskakujaco szybkim tempie morfuje w kierunku zawzietego sasiadoluba. Film zrobiony jest bardzo wprawna reka i zawiera kilka smiesznych tekstow, ale ku mojemu rozczarowaniu przewaza w nim zgnilawa atmosfera ""politycznej poprawnosci"", czy tez kulturowego bon-tonizmu.Byc moze jest to ostatni film Clinta Eastwooda, gdyz jego ""znaki dymne"" sa tu nie do przeoczenia. Pozwole wiec sobie na oficjalne podziekowanie temu aktorowi i rezyserowi, jednemu z moich filmowych idoli, za jego wklad w tworzenie bajki dla poznania ktorej chce sie czlowiekowi wstawac z lozka, wbrew zdrowemu rozsadkowi.Hotel Detective"
5,Gran Torino is Awesome,"I like this movie, it reminds me so much of my father. The drill Sgt in the Marines and a Police Officer for 34 years. RIP Dad 1947-2006This movie, is just great. It is one of my favorites.You won't be disappointed!"
5,Gran Torino,"Another goodie from an oldie. Eastwood excellent as usual. Classic example of suburban prejudice leading to new understandings and unfortunately tragic endings. Eastwood plays a character full of pride in himself and country, who comes up against newcomers, a Hmong family, who at first glance, appear to be aliens in his street/world. Once he gets past his initial prejudice regarding the family, he realises that they are just like any other family, with all their flaws, just like his own. He soon realises that they are victims of crime, trying to avoid the insidious grasp of brutal Detroit streetgangs. He sees a situation that he can change and with a lot of guts, savvy and understanding is able to open everyones eyes. Sadly, life is not always as straightforward nor does it always run smoothly and the choice he makes in the end, in the action he undertakes, serves a twofold purpose - tragic as it is. Good movie, well crafted and well acted."
3,It's okay,Not enough character investment in the young boy. Too little to make Eastwood's choice to turn away from his family believable ....although certainly logical
3,Good movie but,Good movie but after 40 minutes I fast forwarded it (too busy) and not motivated to see a grumpy old man frown for another hour - but the parts I watched were capturing so I'd say this is a good movie.
4,Good Movie,I gave this moving a 4 because at least the first half of the movie is slow but when it gets going it is a very good movie. I do not think this is one of our favorite movies but it is a good movie.
4,Good depiction of a 70-something bigot,Clint Eastwood's performance is what you'd expect. We enjoyed the film and it's message even with it's flaws. Eastwood's politically incorrect lines were hilarious at times. Not many filmmakers would have the nerve to use such bigoted language today.It is definitely better than 90% of the movies recently released on DVD.
5,FAST FAST FAST!!!,"I got this for my y, and expected it to come after his birthday but showed up before. He loved it, thank you very much"
4,a culture that has no respect for elders will pay for it,"Gang violence in cultural enclaves or ghettos has gotten prettymuch out of hand in many cities where the police have ceasedto be any real protection against drive by shootingsand rapes. Here an Asian gang in a formerly all white suburbterrorized an young Hmong man and his family.The Gran Torino was pretty much of a failure as a 70's muscle car( much like the Edsel before it),but thirty years later is has become a classic that the oldfellow cherishes who has just lost his wife and is himself dying of anadvanced lung disease. The young Irish Catholic parish priest is sort of a dead pancomedy relief ( pretty much clueless in the middle of modern decay):these Irish priests show up in Mexican American Catholic churcheswithout a clue about modern life of the communities they are supposed to be serving.The martyr theme here is one that is faulted by the fellow alreadybeing on the way to a painful death?"
5,Masterpiece,"You have to buy this movie! Oh my god, this movie is the most beautiful crime film ever (ironic huh?)! Clint Eastwood sure knows how to act, and the ending made me cry. This film has everything, action, suspense, tradgey, even a little humor. This film is a true masterpiece. Don't listen to the bad reviews!"
5,A Modern Morality Play,"""Gran Torino"" is a different kind of Clint Eastwood movie. Yes he still has a gun (you will have to see how he uses it) but his character is different from any that I have seen him play again. In this movie, Eastwood plays the role of Walt Kowalski, an elderly, crotchety, widower, who, living with his legacy from the Korean War, gradually comes to terms with his ethnically changing, gang infested neighborhood. Key characters include his Hmong neighbors, played by Bee Vang, Ahney Her and a young priest, played by Christopher Carley. All turn in compelling performances as they slowly gain new understandings of those around them. As the story progresses, Kowlaski moves from a not very likable old man to a personification of the Christ motif found so often in literature. By the end, the viewer realizes that he is viewing a modern Morality Play."
3,Love Clint Eastwood,I love Clint Eastwood and am kind of sorry to see him playing old roles now. Wish he could stay young. But he played his typical tough and grouchy man in this movie which I think is his namsake. But it was a nice movie.
4,"Loved, loved it!","Great movie with a great actor. Again this was an assignment and it helped tremendously. The movie depicts Asian American, Mexicans, and African Americans in the same light as gang members."
1,South Africa Road Atlas,"I ordered this atlas hoping for an atlas of South Africa of the quality of the Rand MacNally Atlases put out for the US, and was very disappointed in this one. It is barely more than useless, with maps with inadequate detail, and no good map of the whole country for planning purposes. We are currently in South Africa and have had to get other maps. There are better atlases (we had one five years ago, but cannot find it this year on the internet)."
1,Do not buy this product,"When I first got this product, it would not work; even though it was inspected in Feburary and past inspection. Although the price is nice, the actually product was crappy."
3,Trying to contact manufacturer (GPX) directly,"Hope you can lead me in the right direction. I have two boys, ages 10 & 12, who received GPX Model C3853G Portable CD Players for Christmas last year. The CD players work fine, unfortunately they have lost the covers for where the batteries go in. They both lost the cover for their CD player. Can you supply the address for the manufacturer? If this Model CD player is no longer made, we will need to purchase new ones, with battery covers intact.Thanks for your help."
3,"Just ""OK""","I like this pedal, it gives a nice sound... however, i do experience volume drop whenever using it. Its just quieter than my guitar plays without it... which is a real shame, as I don't really know if any easy way to fix this issue other than buy a better pedal. I'd say shop around before you buy this pedal, but its not terrible for what it is."
2,QC for the product leaves much to be desired.,"Bought 18 of these as part of a large Dell order. Over half of the units are so sensitive to mechanical movement that they will shut themselves off with no warning. Just plugging in an unconnected power cord (i.e. - no load) or the USB cable will cause those particular units to shut off. (Not all of the 18 have this problem.) The USB connection to the WinXP based ""power options"" tab automatically gives you a ""running on batteries"" option for graceful shutdown (I suppose) before the batteries run out. Nice.I'm extremely disappointed with the quality control (or bad design) of this unit. We have called Tripp Lite warranty folks, and supposedly we'll get new (or replacement ) units with no questions asked (other than S/N of the unit and date of purchase). I hope the replacements don't have this problem too.We might have gotten a bad batch, but until they get their QC problems ironed out, I would stay away from this unit."
2,"Works only so-so, good physical layout for my needs.","It's inexpensive, hasn't caught fire, and has protected our equipment so far. Sometimes turning a space heater on or off will cause my television to blank out for a second. Both are plugged in to the UPS.[NEW EDIT 3/2012] I've had this over a year now, and recently a power fluctuation caused the lights to flicker, but it caused my computer to shut down. The UPS should have handled this flicker without powering down the computer. Lowing review from three to two stars."
3,False Description - Not a True Story,This movie was strange indeed with a twisted turn. It is not a true story as indicated on the description. This was probably just inserted as an assault on the Catholic Church by Amazon.
4,Puget Home Owner's Guide,"This is an excellent reference for both the home owner and the shoreline manager. I used this book to aquaint myself with the shoreline of Whatcom County, and the littoral drift cells, as well as the coastal hazard areas. The book gives great descriptions of the shorelines on Puget Sound, and the different issues that face current or future home owners.This book explains the problems associated with development along the sound, and what future problems to expect if you do live on the water. I recommend this if you are looking for a home on Puget Sound, or already have one."
2,Check out my review!,"....Eric Powell has stripped away everything I liked about 16 Volt with this album. He is going more for a strictly rock/metal sound; gone is the noise. Plus, the guitar riffs ""are boring"" and the lyrics ""are awful"". Do yourself a favor and pick up Wisdom, the 1st album. Then collect Skin, supercoolnothing and then Demography. Get this one only if you need to round out your 16 Volt collection. The only saving grace of this CD is the song 'A Cloth Like Gauze' Do yourself a favor... avoid this CD like the plague."
4,"It's the Pavillion, nothing else...!","Five stars were it for Salonen and the LA Phil alone, but still some ""problems"" remain.Bruckner DEMANDS space, a crisp, even bland approach, room to breathe, and I don't feel this recording can deliver that. As a benchmark here, compare to, say, a typical Bruckner-Karajan recording with the Berlin- or especially the Vienna Philharmonic!Having said that, the playing here is energetic, almost ferrocious sometimes, and the orchestra really catches fire in movements 3&4. But they are fighting against the awkward opaque acoustics of the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion. Most notably the strings suffer in this environment, and what still worked well for Mahler's horn-oriented 3rd, becomes a drag for the string-heavy Bruckner 4. Record it again, Esa-Pekka, at the new Walt Disney Hall.Overall, by no means a bad cd, but the acoustics of the Pavillion are less than helpful here."
5,"beautiful embossed blocks, non-toxic inks, and great customer service","We love these blocks. Unfortunately, our dog got a hold of one of them (and our son's name was on one of the blocks-a hebrew animal name) and I saw that they offered free replacements on their website. I called the number and a woman instantly answered the phone. I simply paid for shipping, and our set is now complete. Out of the reach of the dog. I'm happy to pay a little more for such a great toy; knowing it is made in the USA, from safe raw materials."
5,Great Multimeter,"This is a great multimeter, it has all the options I need to handle my discrete components except capacitors. I like the auto adjust which adjusts to specifically the resistance your measuring, etc. It also has continuity check which is very useful after soldering. Overall I'm very satisfied with this item and you can't beat the price for what you get."
4,Good meter. What's with these batteries?,"I've used this multimeter for several projects and have even ordered a few for other people. I like its functionality and ease of use.I have run across more than one instance where the meter doesn't function out of the box. Changing batteries solves the problem every time. The batteries supplied with this model are beat up in ways that couldn't possibly happen after assembly or in shipment. Manufacturer might consider either a lighter hand during assembly or a different supplier for their batteries.As for the meter itself, two thumbs up!"
3,Decent Multimeter,This is a decent multimeter that seems accurate and helpful for testing my electronics. The only issue is the time it takes to lock onto the correct range. There is no way to limit the range that it will search so sometimes it can take a while.
4,Equus 3320 Digital Meter,"Haven't used it a lot, but it works well so far. The auto range function is nice. Arrived within the time estimate."
4,Very Good Price,"Quality seems to be very good. I have not had the chance to test to much but what I did was ""Spot On""!"
2,Battery load test function died after a couple uses,"After being used just a very few times, the battery load test function of the multimeter died. The lights no longer illuminate when testing a battery, and though the battery icon and a voltage value appear for the battery being tested, it obviously isn't drawing any load from the battery since the value is identical to the voltage displayed when switched over to DCV test mode. The few times I was able to test batteries before the test function went kaput, the voltage was always a little lower than the value when switched to DC test mode. I am very disappointed the multimeter malfunctioned so soon after I bought it. Though the other functions still seem to work, the very useful battery load test does not. So much for quality control."
2,Defective....,"It worked good for a while then all of a sudden it starts acting up. It still works, but measuring voltage is hard to do because when the leads are not connected to anything they voltage goes up. The multimeter apparently detects an increasing voltage in the atomosphere.... I opened the meter up and couldn't find anything wrong with it, pretty dissapointing considering my free meters from Harbor Freight work better than this."
2,hard to read text around selector switch,text around rotating selector switch does not contrast well with background and is therefore very hard to read. meter seems to work ok.
4,Digital Multimeter Review,I find this Digital Multimeter is value for Money. I like this product. Amazon is my prefered place for buying stuff.
5,Great Little Inexpoensive Meter,I haven't given this meter a lot of testing yet but used it to check an AC outlet and it worked great. Really like that you don't have to dial in the setting... just turn the dial to the correct 'electrical category' and the meter figures out the rest. It has a nice stand and also a band to put around your wrist if need be. Very handy. I will be troubleshooting a short in the auto-sprinkler system in a few days and will update at that time. For now it looks real good. If I had any criticism it's that I wish it used a 9v battery because those batteries last forever. But we'll see how it goes... Overall for $20 it can't be beat.
5,BUEN EQUIPO,ME HA SIDO MUY UTIL Y TIENES FUNCIONES PRACTICA LO RECOMIENDO A OTROS NO ES COMPLICADO EN EL MANEJO DEL MISMO
5,Just what my old eyes needed.,"I was trying to use my old, tiny, analog multi-meter without much success. I decided I needed an upgrade. This did the trick - I don't need my glassed to read this one."
2,You get what you pay for,"Questionable quality. Opened package, tried to peal off display protective sticky cover, glue residue remained on meter. More of a pain in the butt than anything. Next tried the audible diode function, of course to ensure the beeper was working I touched the two leads together, no beep, double checked I had leads in correct port, I did, tried again, no beep. I had to press the leads together quite hard in order for them to make good contact to each other. Needless to say if the leads don't conduct well, it certainly will impact any measurements taken with the unit."
2,equus 3320,have big problem with labeling on equus 3320 very hard to read needs to be much more clearly marked I wear glasses and it'sjust not easy to read
1,Didn't work,"I bought this multimeter and had to send it back because it would start working and stop after a while. Then it would start if it feels like it again and some times it wouldn't turn on no matter what I do.(change batteries, turn it off and on, shake etc)It might be a one time problem but I had it."
3,These cheap devices do not work all the time,I am not sure if all selections work as they suppose and the battery died on me after a year with very little use. So i guess it dreains the battery quicker than it should.
4,Tested almost everything under the sun.,"I bought it primarily for my car; I am constantly updating/upgrading it. Most recent was my car-puter(computer in the car), I wanted to test the load on my battery and the watts/voltage/amperage through my wires to ensure I wasn't putting too much stress on them, so to speak, and it has work great. I have tested a few caps and relays and a few other things around the shop and its working well.On the down side; the little caps on the end of the terminals should be attached, with a little cord or something so that you don't loose them. I lost my little covers pretty much the moment I placed them on my bench to go test my battery. No big, just a suggestion."
4,Good item,Fast Shipping.Good piece at good price.Didn't give it a 5 because there is no way to turn off auto reading. Numbers start jumping everywhere.
4,"Lots of neat features, decent price","I have needed a personal DMM for a while, but they are usually $50-$100 depending on what you want (paid ~$20 for this one).The Equus 3320 is super easy to use as long as ""Ohm's Law"" means anything to you. Even at that, with the auto range finding and hands free strap or stand, you'll be measuring in no time.-Like the battery tester, but not really necessary.-Haven't figured out the best way to store the cords for any DMM."
3,"nice meter for the money, but...",Its just what I wanted and does all that I need and I can actually hear the continuity beep! Thats awesome and the display is very easy to read. Battery checker is nice and even the wife can use that.Update. The battery checker quit working about the third tIme I went to use the meter and this was the biggest selling point for me so the wife could check batteries easily. Meter still works on all the rest I have tried just a bummer the battery part quit. Lowered a couple of stars.
2,Seems to work OK but three big negatives,"Arrived completely dead, messed around, finally figured out how to open and change batteries, then worked. I.e., the installed batteries were completely dead. Also the printing for the range switch is very dark green on black, just cannot be read without a flashlight and young eyes (which mine are not). The AC current range maxes at 0.2 amps, so not useful for measuring measuring the draw of common stuff such as small devices and/or their chargers. I would send it back if it were not so cheap to begin with."
2,"Nice meter, but failed within a week.","Nice meter at a nice price that does everything that I need it to do. Meter feels good in my hand, is easy-to-use and it has an easy-to-read display.So, why doesn't it deserve 5 stars? The meter failed within a week under light use. I took probably 20 measurements with it. Meter will no longer turn on. Checked the fuse (it's fine) and replaced the batteries, but still can't get it to turn on the LCD display.I'm giving this product 2-stars (1-star for the product, and 1 extra star for the hope that the replacement lasts longer.)"
2,Battery Test Doens't Work,I purchased this unit in October but didn't need to use battery load test feature until March. When I needed to check my battery I found that battery load test simply doesn't work: when I connect it to either dead or new battery the LED indicators don't show anything.
2,"Cheap, and very slow","Takes forever to do a short-circuit test. Even when simply touching the two probe together, it'll take about 0.5 to 1 sec to beep. Many times, the beeping is not even continuous, just one beep, done.When measuring AC voltage sitting on top of a large DC voltage, very inaccurate (reads 0.265VAC on top of a 30VDC while VAC should be 0.)Takes forever for any reading to stabilize.This would totally work if you just use it for very simple tasks like measuring a battery. I made a mistake thinking that this would be the right tool to aid my DIY headphone amplifier."
4,Low auto ranging,"Nice meter,I don't think I'd want to pay a technician by the hour to take reading with this meter, I thought I needed to upgrade from a 19 year old RS meter. This one is smaller and slower and it has a built in load in the battery test mood plus you need screwdriver to replace the internal batteries. For the garage tool box it is well worth the price.I would not have spent so little for a primary use meter."
3,Works well,This is a very handy device to have and it seems to work well. I've owned the analog versions and they are much harder to use. For the price everyone should have it in their toolbox.
5,"Lots of features, great price.","Easy to use, works well. The protective covering is easy to hold and it feels sturdy.It has a tilt stand for bench work and an elastic band to hold it on your wrist."
3,It is manufactured in China!,"Would suggest to replace the AA batteries from the get-go. This item would not work out of the package....removed the back (2 small screws), one battery was out of contact but that did not correct the problem...replaced both batteries and eyed the fuse. Good to go. I do like the wristband feature (frees up both hands). This will do for the price paid but will not buy another.Regards"
5,Excellent value!,"Arrived quickly, works well - it's exactly as described. I wanted an inexpensive multimeter to put into our production environment to be used by techs for a simple measurement. The Maintenance group uses Fluke meters costing hundreds of dollars, and I didn't want to tie one of those up. This meter is smaller and easier to use (autoranging, auto shut off) and works reliably and quickly. Is it as accurate as the Fluke? Who knows, and unless you're calibrating equipment, who really cares? I recommend this little bargain."
4,Does the job,"On the whole, a great meter for the price. I think that it is the only multimeter I have owned, so don't have a really good basis for comparison. One thing to remember is to definitely splash out for the alligator clip probes, trying to hold the straight probes on components can be a hassle, and the readings will be all over the place until you get a solid connection to whatever you are testing. Anyway, I can't imagine why I would pay more for a higher end multimeter - this one seems to do the job! I have been using the multimeter for over a year on odd jobs, board testing, voltage tests and checking batteries, etc, and it has performed as well as could be expected."
4,Good meter but...,"This is a meter of above average quality for the price. A great meter to have for the do it your-selfer for around the house, car or boat. However, one function that is lacking is high range AC current (amps) the description says it measures AC current but doesn't say that the max AC amps it can test is 200mA or .2 amps, not really practical for ANY AC current measurments. You can measure the current of say a 20 watt AC light bulb with this meter. The PC you are using to read this draws about 3.5-4 AMPS or about 3500-4000 milli amps, this meter maxes out at 200 ma.I bought it for AC amps but can't use it for that. I'll keep it as a back up meter but I have to buy a better meter for AC amps. I guess that's what I get for being a cheap skate... time to buy a Fluke!"
5,very good,It is working very good and it looks very good as well. It also has a good price and I had received nice customer service. This product is worth it.
1,"Inferior to Craftsman, READ THE MANUAL!","Seemed adequate testing batteries, but takes a little longer to stabilize than others I've used. The main problem was a design issue:Every other multimeter I've used, no matter what brand, had the same convention - the fused inputs were only for use on DC and only for 10-15 seconds every five minutes. Had I read the manual to this multimeter, I would have noticed it's backwards. The fused input is for everything, the unfused input is only DC for so many seconds, etc. Things don't go well if you miss that point.So, after a couple of DC checks, I switch the multimeter over to AC and stick the probes into an electrical outlet. The test leads EXPLODED. Not kidding. 5"" of copper wire actually shot out of the black lead, leaving the insulation intact except for a pinhole. Unit seems to be fine, but both leads are toast. Scared the heck out of me. Huge cloud of acrid smoke.Bottom line, I'll get another Craftsman..."
1,horrible,I just got this and straight out of the box the leads wouldn't even pick up a signal half the time. Very disapointed.....
1,Dead,"DOA. Didn't test it when I received it, past the return time frame when I actually went to use it. 20 bucks flushed down the drain."
4,Very nice! But...,"No nice case, so I'm living in agony over loosing the little plastic caps for the probes and connectors. Likewise, I know very little about electronics (that's why I bought the thing - to learn) and it assumes I know what I'm doing. The manual is about 2 pages - which is good because that is all you need to know. Problem is that it was written by someone who understands electronics. I would wish for a manual had step by step operations for each operation. Well, it's built well, so I suppose it would be untoward to expect a nice leatherette case and a full color hard bound manual with it for the price. It looks cool on my desk too! People think I know how to use it."
3,Decent multimeter,"I purchased this multimeter looking for the best in the low-budget class (under $40). The size and form factor is just about perfect. It feels good in the hand and can be strapped to the wrist for freeing up both hands while working. The oversized display is clear and easy to read.This multimeter is geared more toward automotive measurements than engineering so those looking for hFE, capacitance, and very low current measurements (microamperes) might want to look elsewhere. I found accuracy to be pretty good overall, however resistance measurement across bare leads did not read zero Ohms as it should. I had no success measuring microamperes with this meter.For the price I wish there were more features. The battery measurement is a nice touch other meters don't have as it shows what battery voltage is under load, but if you subtract 1/2 volt on an ordinary voltmeter's reading you'll get roughly the same results."
1,Did Not Function as Specified,"Multimeter showed many good reviews, not my experience:The ""color-coded LED which displays a battery quick check"" never functioned. It doese not light up on any batteries, good, bad or otherwise. Replaced the AA batteries in the meter just to ensure this wasn't the problem. Same result.Digital display showing ""numbers"" when placed in any mode (even with leads disconnected). Move the dial to 1.5, 9V or 12V, without touching the battery terminal and numbers are jumping all over the place. Seems to me if the probes are not touching battery terminal the voltage should read ZERO. Not in this case.I'm sure I'm just one of the lucky ones who received a faulty product.Vender and Amazon NOT contacted regarding what I call a faulty unit."
4,Good multimeter,"This is a good multimeter: big easy to read LCD display, automatic range, improve the voltage / current / resistance test function, a rubber protection shell, and very good battery quick check.I bought it for the function of the battery quick check, so I like it."
4,Good voltage meter.,This is a good voltage meter. Very good for measuring DC voltage (what I use it for). Sorta limited for AC measurements. Nice big easy to read display. Comes with a built in stand that will prop it up. The auto range function for voltage jumps around a lot until you start measuring. Overall I give it a 4 out of 5.
2,Maybe they should put a horsey on the front,"Many desirable DMM features for less than $20, but after living with it for a while, it turns out to be just one more POS from China.First to go was the three-light battery load indicator, lasting about six months. Not a huge deal and probably not worth returning for that alone. At exactly 13 months (one month after expiration of the warranty), the display started dropping elements, which was annoying but the unit still basically functioned. Six months later and the display got worse. With nothing to lose, I opened it up and had a look. Turned out the screws securing the PCB to the chassis were loose (arthritic old ladies in Guangzhou whose best days of operating a screwdriver are well behind them). Got that sorted and back in business, but not expecting this thing to last much longer.Could also use a backlight on the display.There has to be a better $20 meter out there. Wish I knew what it was.Cheers!"
1,Slow and inaccurate,"I bought this mutlimeter based on the great reviews it got but was thoroughly disappointed. The multimeter is inaccurate in reading small resistances - it repeatedly measured my speaker resistance as 4.7ohm instead of 8ohm. When in open circuit, it measures 6V DC instead of 0V. And it is very slow to respond to measurements. I am returning it to Amazon."
3,Nothing Special,This meter will serve for general home use but is nothing special. The case clips that hold the lead contacts are very weak and useless.
5,Love it,"Works great, love the auto scaling, it was the first one I've owned with that feature. Upgraded to strong buy!"
3,strange,"I would only read the reviews from certified amazon (with a grain of salt) purchasers or watch EEVblog on youtube to figure out what you need in a dmm. WAY too many reviews for this product that sound like they went through a Chinese to English translator. Don't hurt yourself with a substandard product, do your research."
3,Worked great for a while....,"I was quite happy with it the first 6 months, but it has a problem with the contacts on it's rotary switch and goes on and off sporadically.....I could not get far enough into it to clean but contact cleaner helps for a while..."
4,Does what it's supposed to,For the price this is a great meter. As other reviewers have mentioned the plastic tabs designed to hold the probes are pretty useless but I never really store them like that anyway. I have not experienced the long delays others have mentioned before displaying a reading. plenty of measurements today on 120 and 240 and both showed within a second or so of connecting. I would recommend this product to friends and family.
2,Light-comedy/thriller from the early days,The DVD was in great shape. The film however is mislabeled in that it has little to do with La Llorona. The only mention of the mythical figure is by two con artists who use it to cover their crimes and an elderly woman who briefly tells of the legend.
5,Feast of Joy and Love,"A friend of mine had heard a song on her music choice program on the television, and asked me to investigate the artist and the song..The song was Porch Swing Night Romance...and the artist was Laura Sullivan. I liked it so much that I sampled the other songs on the album and found that I hadnt experienced ""classical"" music in quite that way before!Feast of Joy and Love has quickly became a favorite of mine..and hope that others might enjoy her music as much as I have!"
3,Sets a contemplative mood,"It's music to have alongside as you devote your full attention elsewhere. It's not intrusive. It's the seasoning, not the dish."
3,"Ugh, Flash Cards...","Ok, if you are interested in this product, I'll assume that you already own a Rio, so I guess I can't try to talk you out of that.GOOD - Small, easy to carry around, cheap compared to OTHER flash memory manufacturers.BAD - Expensive compared to CD-R, MD, etc.UGLY - Bad memory clusters will cause skips over time.Basically, if you have a Rio, and need more memory, this is the stuff to buy. Don't try and find Camera flash cards, and figure out how to use them in your Rio. That would not only be a nuscence, but also would end up costing you more. If you don't own a Rio, and are considering buying one, take a look at my reviews of the PMP300 and the PMP500.- E-Mail me at nairos@home.com if you have any questions -"
4,"Not bad, not bad at all","This mp3 player is the ultimate in portable music players. The only thing bad about it is that there is only 32MB on memory in it. Also the flash memory cards are not that easy to get ahold of from where I'm at. And I believe that this item should be shipped anywhere in North America, not just the U.S!"
4,Worthwhile Arabian Classical,"Deben Bhattarcharya is justly noted for his wide-ranging field recordings, the majority of which are folk music. Here we have the classic Arabian taqsim and maqam in quite creditable performances from the 1950's and 60's. Regrettably, the first half of the disc is a sort of ""introduction to Middle Eastern instruments"" that tips more toward educational than entertaining. Beginning with ""Hajiz"", however, we get stimulating ensemble work from the order of Syrian dervishes that sets the musical juices flowing.This is a worthwhile purchase, but there are all-dervish recordings I'd choose as an introduction to the genre."
5,A longtime favorite of mine,"I've had my copy of this since high school. Most of my other books are gone, but I still have this one. It's a very excellent overview of the developments in chemistry, from the early days of discovery, from Lavoisier, to Mendleev, to the Atomic Age. A wonderful book that livens up what can be a very dry subject."
3,"no dust jacket, no cover illustration - appears cheaply made","I brought this book as a gift and was disappointed by the presentation of the item. It was a brand new book and very expensive! A small hard cover edition with no dust jacket, no cover illustration and looked cheap. However, the book was highly sought after by the person I purchased it for which justifies the price.I am happy that it has remained in print!"
2,Well....the art's kinda nice...,"...but the story's allover the place.I appreciate that an author has a very limited word count when it comes to children's books, but this book wasted what space it had on repeated phrases.I wouldn't recommend it. I think that if you were to read it aloud to a child, you'd spend more time explaining what was meant than actually telling a story."
3,updated methods,For anyone who purchases these older re-published books take them for just that - historical value. Canine training has advanced alot in the intervening 70 years and what was done then is not so valid today. Some things may never change but the methods and techniques to train dogs is dynamic and better methods that get the same results without strong physical corrections are prevalent in today's industry.
5,SONY WATCH BATTERY,"WHAT CAN I SAY IT WORKED PERFECTLY, MY WATCH RUNS NOW, I WOULD BUY AGAIN, I HOPE THIS HELPS YOU IN CHOOSING A WATCH BATTERY, LOLOL"
3,Okay but didn't hold my attention,"I picked this book up free from Gutenberg. Old-fashioned romance as a young man pursues his lady fair by befriending her wild nephew, since her aunt wants her to marry a rich nobleman.Okay but never caught my interest, consisting mostly of Imp's antics. I got halfway through and skipped to the end."
2,"Get Bayou Classic, not King Kooker","King Kooker outdoor fryers are crap. The one I had fell apart after only one year; The burner snapped off at both joints.I would highly recommend Bayou Classic brand for the following reasons: 1. The pot comes with a basket as well as a turkey rack. 2. It comes already assembled, except for the regulator. 3. It's much more sturdy and the welds that hold it together appear to be more durable."
1,Do not waist your time and money buying this item.,"Do not waist your time and money buying this item.When I placed this unit on a level surface, it wobbled back-and-forth because there is a 1/8 inch discrepancy in the build. I'm sure the discrepancy would be fine if you were using a heavy pot of oil/water, but I purchased this item for a wok and cast iron pan, which doesn't have the weight to eliminate the wobble.I was going to have the welding department at my office fix this item but they told me it wasn't worth their time. They also pointed out all the poor welding... This unit will be sent back to Amazon!"
3,not for ds lite,"I'm not sure how well this product works because I have not taken it out of the box. After seeing the item up close, it's clear that it does NOT work with the DS Lite (what I bought it for). I am not familiar with all of the variations on gaming systems, so I assumed that ""Nintendo DS"" included the DS Lite. Don't make the same mistake I did."
5,Very Helpful,It is very cool to have on road trips. Shape is a little awkward when plugging in. I recommend it to anyone with a gba sp.
1,Doesn't fit my DS,"Maybe it's me, but the description said this was for Game Boy Advance SP/Nintendo DS. Well, it doesn't fit."
3,great,This gameboy charger works and and no problems if you buy this new then you will have no no problems what so ever so the people that says this dont work it dose so you best bet is to buy it new so you wont worry and wonder is this going to work it will if it's in good condition but it's great.
1,Doesn't work for Nintendo DS (or DS Lite),"We have the Nintendo DS, that came out before the DS Lite. This charger does not work with it at all. I don't know what kind of other DS there is besides the DS, DS lite, and DSi, that this charger is supposed to work for, but it definitely does NOT work with the Nintendo DS."
1,Not for Nintendo DS,The description says it works for Nintendo DS and it does not. Not even close to the same port size.
5,Great Book. Teaches the fundementals of writing a great essay.,This book has helped me become a better writer. A must in anyones library if you want to be a better writer.
1,Very poor biography of Robert Kennedy,"Unlike many readers, I did not like this book and stopped reading after 70 pages. It is a poorly-written biography. Many issues, like the civil rights struggle and the Kennedy's angst, are not analyzed with great depth. The ancedotal stories of Bobby and Jack are cute, but lend nothing to an intellectual understanding of Robert Kennedy. Perhaps those who know nothing of the Kennedys might enjoy this book; but, for serious biography readers, this is disappointing and unreadable."
3,It works,"The main thing that attracted me to this product was the price and the fact that you could set it for as long as 23 hrs 59 min. But when I got it, I found that the craftsmanship was pretty cheap, and the beeping sound was kind of annoying. And there's no way to really turn it off when you're not using it. It works fine, and I don't plan to return it, but I probably would've purchased a different one if I could see and feel and hear this one first."
3,Works well with limitations,"This product works well with some limitations. I like the ability to shut the unit and have it revert back to the original time. When doing exercise intervals, this is a time saver because you don't have to constantly re-set it. But alas, not a capability of this unit. Truthfully, I find all of these timers somewhat flimsy, but it's easy to set and does what it says it will, so there's not a lot to argue about."
3,Functional Markers,"I use these at our tutoring center on a large dry erase board mounted on the wall. The Bic Great Erase markers write in colors no bolder than other chisel tipped markers I've used. They do have a lower odor than some other markers and the so called molded grip is comfortable.After plenty of use the markers do display smooth writing and the chisel tip allows the user to make fine or broad lines. The Great Erase nomenclature is a bit misleading in my experience, at least. These markers require the same amount of effort to erase as previous markers we've used. In fact, a student complained to me the other day about the difficulty she was having erasing her writing. Maybe it's the fault of our dry erase board.My conclusion: These markers are as good as any, but I'm certainly not overly impressed by the touted features."
2,there are better products out there,"I'm being using Staedtler's lumocolors for quite a time right now. Since I couldn't find lumocolors in amazon, I decided to try these BIC markers since they looked cheap and nice, but I was wrong. Compared to lumocolors they are pretty bad: they have a very intense odor of alcohol, and its ink is very light compared to lumocolors', lumocolors have a very solid and dark ink. As I said before they are very cheap, I don't know if I'm going to use these markers or not, but the next time I'm going to wait to find lumocolors."
4,Excellent product; packaging needs improvement.,"These dry erase markers work exactly as advertised. However, the packaging is so old school. It is tough getting the product out of the package. Get some scissors...don't bother with the perforations in the cardboard back."
3,so so,"BIC Great Erase Grip Chisel Dry Erase Marker, Chisel Tip, Black Ink, 12 Dry Erase Markers (Dozen Box)They are not good. Is difficult to erase. The quality is not good is difficult to erase I prefer expo dry eraser marker is much better, is very good to erase"
3,"Good show, not so great DVD","So I figured I needed to write a little post so I can qualify for my next free book from booksneeze.com - if you havent checked it out then do so - lotsa free books for just writing reviews for it.This time I am writing about the DVD Hermie: Who is in charge anyway?This series of Christian videos can at times be a little slow moving but always seems to keep my kids attention! The only problem with this DVD was that it used a lot of flashbacks and not much original story. Usually I don't like tv shows that take a whole 30 - 60 minutes of your life looking back on stuff you already know and have seen. I definitely wouldn't pay for the privilege either! So the original stuff looks at hermie, wormie and flo when they were young and God shows them things that they overcame and that He is in charge and bought them to the place they are at.Not much more to say really - I would recommend earlier Hermie's though."
3,"Cute graphics, okay story line","We recently received this cute movie for review. I was excited to share a Christ-centered movie with my children. They really enjoyed the cute characters and fun songs. I LOVED the graphics, which reminded me of Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Kids.Unfortunately, I felt like the story line was a bit of a stretch. There were tons of flash backs to previous Hermie stories, and Who is in Charge Anyway? was a story about other stories. The clips from previous stories looked like they were very cute story lines and I wished I was watching one of them instead of this one. So, I would recommend trying one of the other Hermie movies before this one.Thank you to Thomas Nelson Book Sneeze for providing a complementary DVD for my review. All opinions expressed are my own."
3,Overall...Good Message,"Last week's mail brought with it a copy of Hermie & Friends: Who Is In Charge Anyway? This was the first Hermie movie I've seen and overall I thought it was fine. It has a good message about God's plan for our lives and how sometimes what makes us feel ""different"" is actually what makes us special and can be used by God for something great. It was cute, but definitely not a huge attention grabber or super fun (I was expecting something like Veggie Tales and fun songs). This would probably be good for young children, but might get boring for older kids.I received this DVD free from Thomas Nelson Publisher's BookSneeze program in exchange for my honest review."
3,A cute alternative to Saturday morning cartoons,"I had never heard of this video series before so it was a cute surprise in my mailbox.I have to agree with the previous reviewer that the story in this particular video was pretty difficult to follow not having had the background of the characters from previous videos. The main video is about 30 minutes long, good for a little older toddler with a longer attention span.If your children are used to the Saturday morning cartoon route, this might be a nice alternative with a positive message. The animation is cute too.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255 [...] : ""Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."""
3,Not bad,"I have yet to watch all of these movies, but i have to say for the price you cannot beat it. It is basicallly $1 for each movie. I love vamp fils and these seem to be interesting, the only thing is you have to watch it on an old tv, because the hd tv's don't look good at all because the movies are old. But if you in the mood to watch some vamp movies from back then and now, then check it out."
2,got chips?,The few movies I was able to stomach through were filled with my thumb on the fast forward button. Low budget only begins to express this collection.
4,Interesting !,Basic essential knowledge for chess players ! for intermidiate players ( 1600 - 1800 ) to improve their attacking skills .
2,"Get 'Power of Great Music"" instead. this has rerecordings!","Three of James' biggest hits, Just Once, One Hundred Ways and I Don't Have the Heart are all RERECORDED!!!! Why do they do that? It's not even listed on the CD, but on the inside only after you've bought the CD, opened it, and can't bring it back! Besides, most of the tracks are the same as on the Best of CD, although there are some previously unreleased tunes on this one. Of course, there are also some gems on the Best of that are missing from this one."
3,"Forever More {Love Songs, Hits & Duets}",It's an okay collection but some of my favorite songs from this wonderful singer are rerecorded versions of some of his greatest hits. I was a little disappointed by that. While they sounded nice and maybe they will grow on me i still wished the original versions of these songs were included.
3,No James Ingram hits compilation is complete without. . . .,"""Baby, Be Mine"" -- if there's a more compelling, touching, more beautifully-sung love song -- OK, Terence Trent D""arby's Sign Your Name is perhaps superior -- then I don't want to hear it. James's soaring vocals and the orchestra are musical bliss -- but the song is on one of his older albums, the same one that originally had I Don't HAve The Heart. I think it's called ""It's Real"", when JI tried to throw some hip-hop spin on his stuff. His voice is great enough to carry anything off, so it worked for me."
4,MotheRof4DiMeS,"Great toy! This is my daughter's favorite Christmas gift. It took a long time to assemble, but it is a lot of fun. I was sort of disappointed that it came with baseballs but no baseball bat, but the kids enjoyed it anyway."
4,We are having fun!,"I was afraid that it would be too simple for my 2nd grader, but since he is struggling with math it is right on target. The music is a bit cheesy but he doesn't mind. :-)"
2,Not terribly exciting,"My kids listen to a very wide range of styles, but were not remotely interested in this CD."
3,Its more about Mongolia than Golf,"Although an admirable task, it came across as a way for the author to make some money by writing a book.Even the author himself wasn't sure what the purpose/goal was for his trip, as he stated at the very end of the book.Conclusion, there is nothing much about the spirit of golf, it was more about ""awareness"" of Mongolia."
5,How good this toy is,"I'm 11 and my goal was to become a magician. With this set it was easy! All I had to do was read the book that comes with it, practice a bit, and put on a show, and suddenly everyone thought I could really pull a rabbit out of thin air! I recommend you buy this for yourself or anyone else who loves magic!"
1,Lacking the entire vocal world,"I also was disappointed, that the original russian language soundtrack was completely missing from this collection, though that could be made known before purchasing this item so it was not a surprise.But the thing they *DIDN'T* mention and which was the worst major disappointment, was that they have changed the music and songs of this animation ENTIRELY!! There was nothing left from the beauty of the original melodies of the songs. I was a child when I last saw this (now 26), but I noticed immediately that they had changed the entire soundworld of the animation. The only good thing in this was the animation itself.I really wonder why they did have to change the entire vocal world of this animation. Should it been at least the original music and song melodies...but there is pretty much nothing left of the memory I carry in my heart of this animation."
1,"""Lost in Translation""","""Alice and the Mystery of the Third Planet"" was my favorite cartoon growing up. I've seen it so many times - I had it memorized down to minute details of character intonations. While the story itself if fairly basic, the wonderfully crafted dialog, sharpness of each line, as well as the outstanding voice acting, made ""Mystery of the Third Planet"" a true pop-culture icon of my generation.Unfortunately, all the acting talent involved in creating the English version of the sound-track wasn't enough to compensate for the quite sub par quality of the translated dialog. Not only did it fail to convey the beauty of the original, it made even the basic plot-line difficult to follow. And what's even more frustrating, the original Russian sound track is NOT EVEN INCLUDED on the DVD.I for one would not call this ""Stories From MY Childhood""."
3,nice!!!,"good russian movie for children!!! the copy is not very good, but the main interest is the nice story!!! for everybody!!!!"
4,Evaluation of Caro,The book looks at cheetahs from an evolutionary stand;it takes into account the major factors which affect the fitness of an animal. This book is a valuable educational resource for those intrested in the behavior of the cheetah. This text however is not very exciting or entertaining. I recommend that you use the book for educational purposes or you may be disappointed.
3,Your run of the mill boom box,"This is your average boom box. Dont expect professional quality sound. However at this price, I would not nit pick on this piece."
5,Terrific CD,This is a terrific CD. It's a very sensitive performance with passages that provide a most pleasant listening experience. I enjoyed it very much.
5,I want more!,One of the best indies I've found so far this year. I wish she had more albums/music to offer as I've got to play this one over and over and over and over.....Highly recommended and any buyer will not regret buying it at all.
4,Very nice pop album,"Beth Boucher's debut is a very strong one. This is a very catchy and instantly likeable recording. The songs are radio friendly without being boring, they have interesting melodies and rhythms and Beth's voice is very nice. She knows how to write a good solid pop song.(read full review at collectedsounds.com)"
4,A Must Read for Purple and Gold Fans,This comprehensive account of Tiger football history ranging from 1893 to 1992 Louisiana State University (LSU) offers stories about past players and games as well as a complete listing of lettermen and scores.
5,Fabulous!!,"Kathy has put together the best information in this DVD, I have learned so much from the demonstrations and most importantly, I have learned that my thumbs are not really what I should be using....which is excellent news to me!!Everyone needs this DVD in order to learn the ""right"" way of doing a massage, as well as the ""right"" way of receiving one!!It says that this was made for the beginner, which is everyone who doesn't have this to learn with!!Very well put together, and definitely something everyone will benefit from!!Thank you so much Kathy!!"
3,"nice pictures, mediocre text","I am disappointed in this story book. While I really like the pictures; I think the text is often times confusing. I think the wording is not child friendly. I don't mind adult language, but I think even important concepts are described poorly.For example; Jesus is Baptized and Tempted is the title of the story on page 138. I think those are both important concepts and should be dealt with individually. The word tempted is never defined. In the very small section that deals with his temptation in the wilderness; Satan is quoted and Jesus's replies are not included. It only says ""Jesus Defeated Satan by quoting the word of God."" This just happens to be our reading from last night. I am pretty equally dissatisfied with the text on other stories in the book."
3,Favorite Bible Stories,"The content of the book is excellent with questions to review. However, it is very small and as a read-aloud probably not recommended. School-aged children would probably enjoy it much more than my three-year old grandson."
2,its ok,case works ok - collects a lot of dust kind of thoughbelt clip broke off after approximately 3 minutes of use
5,the best case for your sidekick 3,I purchased this case for my sidekick 3 and I have to say its the best. I had some others but they did not protect the sidekick as good as this one. This case is strong not flimsy and very attractive and stylish. It fits perfectly and its easy to open and close. It protects the screen from scratces and it just looks and feels perfect. If your looking for the perfect case for your sidekick look no further. Also its a great price.
1,Tantra Lite,"One of the few titles on this subject I could find that included photographs, but very disappointing. The models are bland and distant-looking; they don't seem spiritually or sexually involved. And the text was so light-weight, I have gotten better, more complete information from articles. Perhaps enough for someone who wants a taste of the exotic, but not challenging enough intellectually or spiritually."
4,The Art of Tantric Sex is a work of art,I found this book in hardback a few years ago and just was stunned by the beauty of it. The photographs are works of art in and of themselves. It reminds us of how beautiful sex can be - it just depends on where you put your mind to see it. Thank you - I hope it continues to be available at least through other dealers in hardback as it makes a great wedding gift!
1,Misleading,"If you are looking for a history or survey of that medieval entity centered in Germany, the Holy Roman Empire, this is not for you.What we have here is a provocative anti-Catholic conspiracy screed from Freemasons of the early 20th Century."
5,Beautiful Lyrics and Melody,The beautiful lyrics and melodies are outstanding. The songs hit the heart and inner soul and bring back memories which have been forgotten.
3,Worth it?,"This is a pretty ""cool"" CD player and I like the 40 second anti-skip, but I bought it for my car. I have a nice little built-in space for a CD player in my car. Well, this particular CD player doesn't fit in it because the two outlet plugs are on either side of the player. One on the left, one on the right. This makes it wider, and therefore does not fit. That is really annoying! Plus, when the weather is too cold. It doesn't work. I can't keep it in my car in the winter. So depending on what you'll use it for, it's ok."
5,erm,it's a great cd player love the 40 sec anti-shock thing the head phones are ok just shaped funny but hey they came w/it and in a way were free and anything free is good
3,Great CD player *BUT*.....,"I give this 3 stars due to the fact of the players inability to play CDRs... For those of you who don't record your own music on cds, this player is great.. For those of us who love making compilation albums or back-up their original disks, I would suggest you purchase another player..."
2,Don't Buy This Discman,"This Discman has given me many long hours of grief. The batteries die down so quickly. Also, it is not very compatible with CD-R's. If you buy this discman to save money, the batteries will cost way more in the long run. Go for a discman that uses at least 30 hours out of your batteries."
3,Not what I expected,"For what I paid for a VHS tape, I expected a bit more of a workout. The tape is good for someone who has never done spinning before. It shows how to set up the bike, etc. The actual workout is only about 40 minutes."
4,Nostalgic charm,"Benson never was an F. Scott Fitzgerald or an Edith Wharton or a Dorothy Parker, but she was literate. JUNIOR MISS possesses a Middle American charm and gently recovers--in its presentation of sights and sounds--the vanished world of the late thirties and early forties. Naive, in retrospect? Of course! The protagonist is a child, after all, and Benson never reached for large cultural ironies anyway. Nevertheless, the book has enough edge hold interest, and an added attraction is the possibility that it's a book your parents or grandparents would have read when young."
5,Simply one of the Best albums ever!,"If you listen to music you will love this record! Rocky has a voice like no other, yet he reminds you of virtually ever good rock/folk superstar you've ever heard..and how often is that a good thing? Dylan and Schwarzenbach may be some of his influances (for a reason) but with this album they don't hold a candle to Rocky. If this album isn't in your collection then it isn't complete. This has to be one of the best records of 2003 - My mom even loves this record."
5,Awesome,"If you are a Frida Kahlo fanatic, you will love this. They are small, but its a good deal for the price."
4,Trumpter Fred A Story of the Plains,I found the book interesting reading. I can't really tell you why I like it other than it was interesting. I recommend it to anyone who like cowboy tales
1,Stains! DO NOT BUY! NOT WASHABLE,THESE STAIN! NOT WASHABLE! Not for kids...or even adults. One drip will cause a huge permanent mess in your home
3,You should hear the rest.,"This album is an excellent album...but only worthy of three stars since its only half of the album. (otherwise it would get its deserving 300.)The K Records re-issue didn't include 10 of the original tracks...like Pretty Girl. I LOVE THAT SONG. You would too, so to all people who love the treepeople you should check out the following bands.... 1.Guilt Regret Embarrassment-Treepeople on Toxic Shock Records 2.Goodbye Harry-foodstamp Barbeque 3.Caustic Resin- anything by them is good..and Bret Netson is on the first Built to Spill album. 4.as if you didn't know...Built To Spill 5.Stuntmen-they are an excellent Boise Band and they are also in the treepeople family tree. 6.Lync...excellent 7.Love As Laughter....Doug covered one of their songs at the last 3 shows I went to....tres' manifique."
5,Great rock as only Doug Martsch can make it!,"This album is loaded with great hard-hitting Martsch-rock. Pre-BTS, I think this album displays Doug's harder side as with his other Treepeople album ""Something Viscious For Tomorrow"". Well worth the money."
3,"ok, but try Something Vicious also","This isn't Built to Spill, nor the Halo Benders so don't expect them to sound the same. They are the Treepeople and this album sounds like a Treepeople album, but buy Something Vicious / Timewhore also 'cause that is the definitive treepeople album."
2,dissapointed,"it amazes me to witness how often people exaggerate their album reviews. i'm a dedicated built to spill fan, love doug and also most of his work for the halo benders. guilt regret embarrassment is nothing close to doug's best work. it's a different band, not to be compared with bts. there are only a couple of songs that have the bts feel and unique layering. however, the remaining songs are sub par/ borderline fair and lack any real interesting melody. this is definitely a faster paced album with simlpy one faced rhythms attached. granted, if the bts lover wants this as part of some archive novelty, then go for it, but overall, i don't feel its an album worth purchasing."
5,Rebirth,"When I hear this music, my soul and my esprit resuscitate. Michelle Belanger have a very good voice. Nox Arcana that I know long-past complete this fabulous album."
3,Haunting Gothic themes occasionally overdone,"Michelle Belanger has a good voice, but Charolette Church she is not. She's not the next great soprano, but certainly she can make some very fine melodies. In several of the songs she overlays her vocal tracts to make harmonies that are very lovely and haunting (particularly Bitter Ashes and Angels are Weeping).None of the songs are BAD, but in some I was honestly reminded of almost comically overblown poser Goth poetry. These kinds of songs shouldn't honestly make me want to laugh at their sheer pretentiousness, should they? The poetry angle that seems to be most of the inspiration for the songs makes for fairly simplistic melodies. There's nothing wrong with that, and I thoroughly enjoyed at least half the songs on this CD, but some of them rate more in the tedious category than haunting or inspiring.My advice, buy this on the cheap if you need some inspiration for your next Vampire: The Masquerade game, or your next delving into the world of Goth."
3,Not Bad,"I thought this would add a new dimension to Nox Arcana, it does, but not a big enough one. Out of the nine songs, five are great, four are good, but none are AWESOME. A good buy but not a Must Have."
2,Division,This CD wasn't very helpful. It wasn't what I thought it was. So I was disappointed in my purchase.
5,Man of Marble,"One of Wajda's most politically daring films, ""Marble"" was censored upon release, yet it resonates with the same animus for corruption that ultimately drove the Soviets from power. Agnieszka's difficulties with a wary producer and the reluctance of her interview subjects to speak on-camera parallel the story of an idealized worker, movingly depicted by Radziwilowicz, banished for challenging Party authority. Employing a ""Citizen Kane""-like story structure, Wajda cleverly satirizes both the filmmaking impulse as well as government distortions of truth."
3,Man of Marble,"I bought this film for my daughter who was studying the Polish Solidarity movement at school. I watched it first and really enjoyed the film. It is long and sub-titled, but still well worth it. It had real vision interspersed within it, so you get a real sense of what is was like through this time. My daughter watched it also and she enjoyed it, though for her elements of it were a bit unreal. It is best to watch this first then Man of Steel as the 2 are linked and the flow is better if you watch them in order. A very moving tale about a naive mans journey to enlightement and despair about his country and the way they were manipulated."
4,Does the Job,"I've had this pedal for a couple of years now. Its been reliable with some pretty heavy use. Only down side is it's difficult to see the LED lights in the sunlight. When I play outdoor gigs i need to bend over pretty close to the pedal to see whats going on with my tuning. Other than that, excellent pedal. Definately would replace if it was lost or broken."
4,a must for the touring musician,If you play any gigs at all (with a set longer than two songs) you need this tuner! great features and can patch directly from guitar to tuner to D.I. or amp. NICE!
1,Never received the book!,I ordered this book in September. The tracking information says it was received Sept 30 but it has never arrived at my home!
1,Ludicrous,Hopefully readers will retain enough objectivity and common sense to recognize what a heartless and absurd argument Ms. McDonagh presents. I recommend you do not choose to buy this book; otherwise you will be consenting to an assault on your intelligence.
5,Quality quality quality!,"I was looking for something a little different than just another outfit for my soon-to-be grandchild. I know that things like blocks are a fantastic toy for kids--the kids do the ""work"", not the toy. I wanted something of good quality and this fit the bill entirely! The blocks are colourful, interesting, solid, and generous in proportion.I also appreciate that this is a North American product and creates jobs here. I am a little cautious about some products from PRC, especially if they may end up in the mouths of children.In a nutshell? Very happy with my purchase!"
4,Good pair of shades,"I like these glasses, the price was right at Amazon. I primarily use them as driving glasses. They are lightweight, and reduce the glare considerably. Knowing the Maui Jim reputation, they I should be using them for a long time."
3,Seller sent the wrong item - black glossy,"The lenses looks uneven, it's plastic very light, comfortable. However, I think it's for a bigger face rather than small face.It's OK for about 60$ but 150$ is over priced."
3,Maui Jim Makaha Sunglasses,"I'm not certain that this is the real deal. The products looks like the one I have, however the fit is poor and nothing like my old one."
5,Awsome,I bought these sunglasses for my husband as a birthday present and he loves them. He thinks they are very light and comfortable. He also likes that they provide the right amount of sun protection with out being too dark. I personally think that they look really good on him.
5,Great magnifiers,Nice rose color with polarization. Fits perfectly with no sliding down the nose. Best part though is the bottom lens magnifier which allows me to read without putting on my regular glasses. Well done.
5,Better than frosted Flakes - There GREAT.,I have seen Stacy at a Blues Fest and in concert. I think he is Great. Midnight Breeze is my favorite CD of his. I'm a Good Man is also very good. Next time he is in the area I will see him again. Puts on an excellent live show.
2,Disappointing,"After having enjoyed Blue Like Jazz, I went just had to buy this book. What a disappointment. His prose style was extremely irritating, full of stuff like ""Here's what I am trying to say..."" -- just say it!!!! Took me forever to get through the book and I gave my copy away afterwards. Some of his ideas had already been presented in his previous book so if I had not read it, I might have liked this one more."
2,"Not as good as ""Blue Like Jazz""","I purchased this book because I was impressed with ""Blue Like Jazz,"" Miller's preceding work. BLJ is meandering and not especially well organized, but as I read it, every 5 - 10 pages some incredible bit of wisdom and/or experience would explode off the page at me. (It's unusual for a young writer of contemporary Christian literature to ""register"" with a sixty-something person still trying to get a handle on God and spirituality.) Consequently, my copy of BLJ has MANY pages that have been dog-eared for future reference.However, as to ""Searching For God..."" no explosions at all, at least not for me. This one reads more like someone thinking aloud on paper, with no real focus or direction. ""...for God Knows What"" is a pretty descriptive title."
3,Searching for God Knows What,"Searching for God Knows What by Donald Miller is a book intending to shake the traditional Christian's belief about the way things are in many churches today. Miller is not apprehensive to knock organized religion. Being a Christian is all about relationship, about falling in love, about the person of God. The language, duties, ceremonies, etc that go with church are secondary. That idea is not new to me, but several insights in the book were.This book was somewhat political. And political in a liberal-leaning way which bothered me somewhat. Miller dissed Fox News and talked highly of Clinton and Carter, for example. Those things made me mad, to be honest. However, his engaging conversational tone, relevant stories, unique observations, and keen analogies kept me compelled.To be entertained, to learn, to make you think are all reasons to pick up this book. Just beware of the liberal lean which Miller warns is not a reason to negate things either."
3,"Like Dude Man, It's Like A Relationship, Not a formula, Dude!","If you precede each chapter with ""Like dude man, this is what I like think about Christianity."" You'll get the general gist of Miller's book. Interesting, irreverant, but don't look for any depth."
4,"True Donald Miller style... serious, humorous, full of faith. Excellent!","True to form, Donald Miller, in his unmistakable story-telling style, tackles important subjects like faith and theology. Seriously, yet humorously, shedding light on them so that you will never read the Bible the same way again.As the title suggests, this is a personal journey of faith. Faith renounced then found; but not just found, rediscovered with a clearer understanding of God's Word and what it means for mankind.Having read only two of his books, I am a huge fan of Donald Miller's writing. I especially like the way he includes the reader in his personal struggles with life, God and faith.I highly recommend this book. It's an easy, entertaining read, but at the same time will make you think long and hard about what you really believe about God and Scripture."
2,"Ok, but that' all.","I'm a big fan of Donald Miller's book, Blue Like Jazz. So when I picked up his book, Searching For God Knows What, I expected a similar reading experience. BLJ was raw, honest, humorous, and just resounded with my soul. SFGKW came off as if Miller was trying too hard to be clever. There was just something missing. It wasn't awful. It just didn't strike the strong chord that Jazz did. So I guess this is a mixed review. I'm not saying it's not worth reading; but if you haven't read Jazz, read that instead."
4,A Reminder,"This book accomplishes what I believe was the author's intent. It is a reminder to us of what the Gospel of Jesus was/is. Let us never forget it. For those of you trying to ""win wars"", this is the book for you. The Holy Spirit has worked wonders with this author. My only complaint, and I feel as if I shouldn't even mention it, is when he tries to explain the trinity. I'll leave it at that. Regardless, I highly recommend this book. Thank you, Donald Miller. Praise God."
1,searching for God knows what,"Not well written. Miller can't stay focused. He tries to position himself as a somewhat liberal Christian. Don't be fooled Miller, you are a Conservative Christian. Talking snakes and golden streets are embraced in this book. If you are looking for something different than the Conservative view, don't purchase this book."
5,This is a book worth reading over and over,This book is probably my favorite book ive ever read along with donald miller's blue like jazz. i have read this book over and over probably about twice a year. It shaped a lot of my thinking for the good and has had great influence on me. I highly recommend it!!!
5,A Must Read,"What a great book... Miller is a mastermind with words when he talks of ""religion"", ""spirituality"" and God. So well written and very well thought out with his philosophy. I would call him a ""C.S. Lewis contemporary"". If you're a follower of Jesus, I would consider this a MUST READ for you. And for those of you who are searching for God knows what, give this one a try. Miller may just help you find what you've been searching for, after all."
2,eh...,This book was soooo slow starting out. It was definitely not what I was expecting from Donald Miller after having just finished Blue Like Jazz.
1,Confused Rambling Presentation of Christianity,"I found this to be a rather confused rambling presentation of Christianity where the author frequently wanders off into areas barely even tangent to his topic (like his strong personal opinions about the war in Iraq) and often engages in massive unwarranted speculation about the things we read in the Bible like his detailed description of how the people close to the Apostle John supposedly must have ""felt"" and reacted when he died (there is no Biblical or historical evidence to substantiate the detailed account he gives of this) or his speculative account of how long Adam spent naming the animals before Eve was created (the Bible is clear that this all happened on the sixth day of creation - no long period of time here). He seems to be pandering to the confused modern thinking so common in Christianity today and in my opinion ends up just adding to the confusion."
3,"A ""Different Look"" at the Gospel","The ""Word"" is here; the ""Way"" is here, and so is the ""Truth,"" the ""Light, and the ""Life."" The Gospel message is the same; it is everlasting, eternal...but the way in which it is told and discussed in this book can be distracting to the older reader...at times, it feels almost flippant..but the truth remains the same..A new way of telling the ""old,old story"" and discussing the search for identity and meaning in life...""Searching"" is probably best suited for readers 30 and younger. (Remember ""Good News For Modern Man"" was not universally accepted by the ""older generation"" when it came out.) How the story is told is not nearly as important as that it is told. Older folks might want to stick with Philip Yancey."
4,Searching for God Knows What,A unique look at Christian thought and actions. Discovering why we act as we do as humans and what to do about it!
3,A chaotic attempt to deal with personal issues regarding Christianity,"The author seems to have some valid issues regarding the present state of Christianity. The writing style and often chaotic idea development, however, prevented these issues from being fully and powerfully developed. There are many other books available which raise identical questions and issues but offer more thoughtful and careful dialogue to address these topics."
3,"Entertaining, Fresh Perspective on Christianity","This book is an entertaining, fresh perspective on Christianity. The author makes some insightful, amusing observations, rambling from one topic of the Christian life to the next. I found myself smiling often as I moved through the pages, wondering how in the world a person could make such a profound point in such a rudimentary way. I would have given the book four or five stars if it had possessed more content. Still, for an entertaining, fresh perspective on a relationship with Jesus, it is worth the price and the read."
5,Philadelphia Folk Festival 1969,"Alert to ALL Incredible String Band fans...Stop everything & buy this cd, now. You won't have a chance forever. The music is totally magical & they somehow captured the sound of every note...perfectly. We now have the BBC stuff & other alternative recordings...but nothing as great as this cd."
5,True Non-racial Humor,"Well, i bought this dvd mainly because Maz Jobrani was in it. But when i watched it i was amazed at how funny all the comics were. Now not only am i a fan of Maz Jobrani, I am also a fan of Ahmed Ahemd, Aron Kader and Dean Obeidallah. They all were funny as hell.This dvd was mainly done to relieve the stereotype of arabs in the western world and i think that it did a great job.You will enjoy this DVD."
5,HILARIOUS COMEDY SHOW!!!,"I would HIGHLY recommend this video, it is so FUNNY! It arrived perfect. Thank you!"
3,No Insurgents Here,"This is a mild-mannered review of comics of Middle Eastern descent telling what it is like to be Middle Eastern in the post 9/11 world. There is no cutting edge, caustic humor here and few raunchy references. For the most part, this comedy DVD might be considered family fare.I'm not sure whether the comedians' tame tone on this DVD reflects their true dispositions, or whether it's due to the fact that they feel they're in a precarious position in the Western world. Either way, the result is an entertaining, generally unchallenging set of reflections and life stories.However one of the comics does manage to jolt us down to a deeper level of understanding about how dangerous schisms can suddenly form. He says that for most of his life, he was just an American, just a guy - then 9/11 happened - and probably forever after, he will be perceived first and foremost as ""an Arab."""
3,1 out of 4,"The best part in this DVD is Maz Jobrani. That is a talented comedian!I don't mind watching his part over and over again and laugh every time. The remaining 3 guys are ok, but not as good as Maz. If Maz goes solo, I'll be the first to buy his DVDs :)))Go MAZ!"
4,The Axis of Evil Comedy Tour DVD,"I love this video very much, but there was a problem, i like in Europe, so that means the regional code was different so i cant watch it on tv, only on my computer or laptop and i cant sync it onto itunes, it only comes up with windows media player :/"
4,muslim fun,"Its really funny bunch of guys taking a crack at their culture. Its humerous and also lets you see a view you will not see from others. They have guts to do their bit, because Im sure there are some Muslims that will not see it funny at all. Its worth watching."
4,FUNNY!,"Just enjoy laughing at the things that scare you....very, very funny guys! I found myself telling everyone about it for days. Only get it for people who can laugh at the stupidity and narrow-mindedness that we see all around us, even in the aftermath of tragedy."
2,not very funny,"[[ASIN:B000MRA588 The Axis of Evil Comedy Tour (Ahmed Ahmed, Aron Kader, Maz Jobrani, and Dean ObeidallahAren't comedy tours supposed to be funny? Well, one of the comedians is OK. The others are not even OK. There is not much to say. This Axis of Evil Comedy Tour DVD is just not very funny. Skip it."
2,ok not that funny,Maz was the only guy that was funny and creative. Everybody else same old jokes bashing themselves and it got old real fast. I got the dvd used through amazon for $3 and includes free shipping so that was fair to try out this dvd. I was definitly fooled with the 4.5 star rating. I thought this was going to be as funny as Russel Peters but he is on a totally different level of comedy.
4,Funny,"I am a multicultural person and really enjoyed this comedy. My favorite was Maz Jobrani. The others are ok too, but I think Maz is the funniest. If you've ever lived in another country, especially an African / Asian / or Middle Eastern country, you'll like this."
4,Rock this Dub,"Good album. This is a nice collection of tunes that carries on from Mikey's work with the Clash. I get something new with every listening. Good album on a winter's day or a hot, summer one hanging out in the shade with a cold Mt. Gay and tonic. Bottoms up!"
5,"Ahh, how SWEET!","I love their song called ""If Ever."" Finally there is a song that shows that teenage guys are allowed to show their girls the love and respect they deserve. It proves that guys aren't ""whipped"" if they are there for their girls whenever they need them. If only I could meet a guy like the ones in 3RD STOREE!!"
1,From what I know it is great and I really enjoy it 3rdstoree,"I think that they are so smooth, cold, and fire. I don't know there names yet so I'll put it this way the boy that wears the hat on ""Party Tonight,"" is so cute and I will see him at ""TEEN SUMMIT."" I think that boy is so cute everytime I see him I go crazzzzzzy. He has the prettiest smile I ever seen on a boy before. I wish he gets this and he reads it because I want to know evrything about him. Boy you just don't know you are so cute well maybe you do. I just want to tell you that my cousin and I is starting a singing and that is our dreams to become a singer. I want to ask you if you can give a sout out to me at ""TEEN SUMMIT"" because boy you are eveything to me. Brittany Wilson A.K.A (SUGA-B)"
5,3rd Storee puts on a great show!,"I went to go see Britney Spears on July 11, and it was great. 3rd Storee was one of the opening acts. They came out dressed like Inspector Gadget, then stripped! The songs they sung were great. Lil Man has such a great voice! They all do! On top of that, they were the best dancers!"
1,Bizarre experiment,"Harnoncourt music making is like a first class scientific experiment. A lot of tricks based on intellectual research and profound knowledge of historical performance traditions. It is like watching a documentary on Discovery channel. One keeps wondering at things never seen before. If you buy this DVD you will hear Strauss sounding in a way you haven't heard before. I don't find it particularly beautiful. It is odd, it is dry and the musicians try not to watch the conductor, since his gesture is always behind the sound. There is something rather creepy about the way he approaches this music. There is no joy, no excitement and no moments of spontaneous music making. It is the weakest, most bizarre Neujahrskonzert ever."
5,great blowdryer,"This is a fabulous blowdryer. I've had it for nearly 2 years and it is still going strong (versus the two straighteners that I've had in that period)It doesn't seem to be so damaging and I love how the nose is a bit smaller than other blowdryers and also comes with an attachment. The filters do pop off sometimes but that is the only problem I've had.The only complaint really is that when I got this, it only came in one color. Now it comes in five!! (red, white, pink, black, & the original black/red) Would've loved it in pink :("
4,Died within two weeks!,I bought this two weeks ago and was rather surprised to find it has completely stopped working within that time. I will update this to let you know how they handle the return process.Update: Replacement promptly sent and it is working fine!
3,Executive,the product is great but it looked like it was just thrown in the box for mailing. No registration information and no product information was included. Maybe shouln't have ordered it around Xmas time.
3,Just Good Dyer not Great Dryer!,"I purchased an Elchim blow dryer since all the hairdressers use them. I have extremely fine and fragile hair and my last dryer was burning my hair and it was spewing sparks. My siters had also purchased Elchim blow dryers so I thought I'd join in, especially since this was about half the price through Amazon. But I guess like all products, there are top of the line items from companies as well as standard products. This is definitely not top of the line, not bottom of the barrel either, just average. Pros- doesn't fry my hair, is much quiter, the power is lower but more efficient and it has a loop that makes it easy to hang up. Cons- doesn't have a quick shot bottom for a shot of cold air. Also, it takes a little getting use to the handle. (I'm contstantly changing the settings by mistake due to the placement of the nobs). Overall, its better than what I had, but next time I'd upgrade to a more deluxe model."
2,Great if it didn't break,"I bought this for my wife who liked it, until it stopped working 2 monthes after we got it. We'll see how well they honor the warranty. It was a little heavier than her past cheap versions, but dried faster and I liked that it was much quiter."
5,Quiet,Purchased this because my daughter hated the loud hair dryer we had. This one is quite a bit quieter and well made.
2,This product is very weak. It doesn't deserve to pay money on it.,"This product is very weak and when I tried to return it, the company refused.It is different from the website description. the power is very weak to have a good hair. This item doesn't deserve to pay money on it."
2,I wish I had my $20 Conair back,"I had high hopes for this hairdryer. I have thick, relatively straight hair that takes a long time to dry. This hairdryer has a lot less power than my 1800 $20 Conair dryer did. It now takes a lot longer to dry my hair with this blowdryer, and the end result is FRIZZY! I never had frizzy hair in my life. It is also very heavy! I am very disappointed in this blowdryer and frankly, I wish I had my $20 Conair back!"
2,"Heavy, Loud and not that great","This product is not worth the money. It's very heavy, very very loud and doesn't make a noticable difference in the drying time of my hair. It's no better or worse than the typical $20 conair or revlon dryer. Save your money."
2,Misleading color description,I ordered the Elchim Professional 2001 1800 Watt Classic Hair Dryer (Color May Vary) expecting a product somewhat looking as described--perhaps in different shades of red and black. The hair dryer came in black which I did not like. It was returned and the return hair dryer was also black. Since color coordination is an important factor in our tiny bathroom I was really disappointed with the product. I returned both packages and will purchase another red hair dryer. I thought the color description was misleading. I have not tried the product so I do not know about its quality.
3,Good dryer,"I don't like this as much as the T3 I had, simply because it seems to dry my hair out more (I need more product). However, if it lasts longer than six months than I guess that makes up for it. I'm still undecided. I do have to use the attachment or my hair comes out a wild mess with this dryer. And as at least one other reviewer mentioned, the switches seem backwards. I constantly press the wrong one. But that is just a nuisance, not a big deal."
3,Eh...,"The hairdryer is only okay. I will say that the cord is very sturdy, which was a concern from other reviewers. My previous hairdryer was the Chi Turbo Professional, and it lasted about 5 years. I don't like this hairdryer as much as my Chi, and I've had it long enough (3 months) to get used to it. It isn't super quiet like some reviews said, and it doesn't dry my hair any faster than my Chi. Also, the front of the nose (before the black attachment) gets VERY hot and you can't hold it. I like to hold my hairdryers at the nose when I am drying the front of my hair, but now I can't. I'll definitely keep this hairdryer until it's time to get a new one, but it didn't impress me. It still gets 3 stars because it isn't a BAD hairdryer, but also it's nothing special."
2,Not Impressed,"The one good thing about this hair dryer is that it is quiet. Other than that, it is no better than my $15, ten year-old Conair. The Elchim did not dry my hair any faster and my hair is less frizzy when I let my hair air dry. I wanted a high-end hair dryer and was disappointed. I didn't find the Elchim to be worth the price."
5,Worth every penny,Worth evey single penny. does not burn hair. Would order another one in a minute if it broke. I will never buy another cheap blow dryer again.
5,best blowdryer I've ever used,"This is the best blowdryer I've ever owned! It's super powerful and it gets really hot, which is perfect for my type of hair.My hair looks great when the weather's dry, but as soon as there's humidity, my hair gets spongy and wavy frizzy.This dryer straightens my hair no matter what the weather is like. I love it so far. I've only had it a few weeks, sohoping it lasts a long time. It also came sooner than I expected, in just 2 days! The price is good too. It sells for at least$40 more in the salons or beauty supply stores. (I checked!)"
4,Good hairdryer for price,"For the price, this has been a good hairdryer. I was considering much more expensive dryers when I saw reviews for this one. It has great heat control, very cool/warm/very hot. I accidentally change the setting with my fingers like other reviewers, but not a big deal. So far, I like it."
4,Very good hair dryer,I used the same brand hair dryer for 2 decades before buying this dryer. I was very satisfied with it from the moment I turned it on. It dries my hair fast and well. Nobody knows I really have curly hair. I was apprehensive to try a new dryer but this was a good choice. I highly recommend it.
4,Great dryer,"Leaves hair silky and drys fast. It's a bit heavy, but I'd recommend for how much nicer it leaves your hair than an average dryer"
5,Love at first blow,I never knew a blowdryer could be this wonderful. I should have invested in it years ago and saved all that money on straighteners and fancy products that I bought to compensate for crappy blowdryers. Now I know.
4,NOT BAD,"Quiet courtroom mystery featuring a strong Bedelia in the lead as a judge, who is in an unhappy marriage and strikes up an affair with a librarian (Billy Wirth). Her dear friend Charles (Dabney Coleman) is murdered, and she soon finds that the defending attorney is pointing evidence towards her. Well-made, little known feature with good performances and an exciting storyline."
1,Disappointing and bad layout,I bought the book because I like the photographer's work. But when I received my package from Amazon and browsed through the book I was highly disappointed: Some of the best photos are destroyed by having the central element (e.g. a face) in the middle of the book (where the fold is). That is extremely bad and makes the whole book a disppointment.I contacted the publisher about this mistake and the bad layout and they agreed to me and told me the photographer insisted on this kind of layout.So I can only rate with one star and recommend you not to buy this book!
3,Seafood and girls,"Just few pictures are beautiful , I did not like the association of sea food and dead fishes with cute girls posing."
3,MSer for 9 years,"I read this book 6 months ago and I'm still not sure if I really got anything out of it. So,why not find out for yourself and read it!"
3,Not what I expected....,"As a newly diagnosed MS patient, I was looking for something that would provide me with inspiration and motivation to prepare for a future with this illness. Other reviews led me to think this was the book, unfortunately for me it wasn't. It is an honest portrayal of the lives of these women living with Multiple Sclerosis, but without the fighting spirit I was searching for and need."
2,I have MS and found the book boring...,"A bunch of ""chatter"" with little substance...although I am happy for the women in this book who found peace and comfort with each other through ""chatting"" on-line about their sufferings and living with MS...I found it non-inspiring and non-informative..."
1,Think twice before ordering,"The reviews cautioning the newly diagnosed against this book -- and those pointing out it represents the approach of a very particular group of women with a very particular approach to MS -- have floated to the end of the list here. I think it's worth pointing out again that if you aren't into refering to your disease as a ""MonSter"", and are trying to expand your horizons beyond your disease, this isn't the book to get.For those new to MS, this book may be scary: is this the only future open to me? The inspid cuteness may be as terrifying as the disbility!One thing that really bothers me is the suggestion here that people who want to understand women with MS should read this book. This is not the only face of MS. I'm glad the ""froup"" has helped these women. MS is a rough go, and it's good not to go it alone. But you know, faced with the choice between going solo and ""froupping"", I'd pick solo everytime!"
